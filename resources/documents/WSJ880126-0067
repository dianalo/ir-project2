More than 20 big lenders, including PaineWebber Mortgage Finance Inc., WestAmerica Mortgage Co. and Shearson Lehman Mortgage Corp., have introduced reduction-option mortgages in the past two months, and more are considering it, says the Mortgage Bankers Association.    The trade group says it's too early to gauge consumer reaction, but some lenders, like Shearson Lehman, say 8% to 10% of their loan business already is in the reduction-option loans, a level the industry considers high for a new mortgage instrument.    The new mortgage, which carries a 30-year maturity, allows a borrower to reduce the interest rate on the loan once, from the start of the loan's second year to the end of the fifth year, if prevailing mortgage rates fall at least two percentage points in a single year. That could mean borrowers wouldn't be able to take advantage of a gradual drop in rates.    But adjusting such a loan is cheaper than refinancing a fixed-rate mortgage. Lenders generally charge less than 1% of a reduction-option loan's balance outstanding and a $100 fee, compared with fees of 2% to 4% on balances to refinance fixed-rate mortgages. While interest rates on reduction-option loans run about a quarter of a percentage point higher, lenders say the overall cost of an adjusted reduction-option loan generally will be lower than that of a refinanced fixed-rate mortgage.    The adjustment process is also much simpler than a refinancing, says Graham Williams, senior executive vice president at Newport Beach, Calif.-based Shearson Lehman Mortgage. A borrower need only call the lender to initiate a change and lock in a lower rate.    Modest Rises Expected   In Housing Prices   INCREASES in housing prices this year will be the smallest since 1985, according to trade groups. Prices of new homes are projected to increase 7.5%, down from 14% in 1987, while prices of existing homes are expected to climb 4.6%, down from 5.7%.    The projections reflect flat construction-material costs and slowing demand for housing in every region -- even the Northeast and West, where, economists say, high prices finally are generating consumer resistance.    For new houses, the National Association of Home Builders says the median price will rise to $112,890 from $105,000 last year. The group says the biggest increases will be in the West (5.6%, to $120,300) and South (5%, to $92,700), the smallest in the Midwest (2.3%, to $93,900) and Northeast (3.7%, to $146,800).    Land remains the single most costly item, accounting for 35% of the price of new homes, up from 25% in 1986.    For existing homes, the National Association of Realtors says the median price will rise to $89,000 from $85,100 last year. The biggest gains will be in the Northeast (7.5%, to $143,405) and the West (6.5%, to $112,464), with smaller increases in the South (4%, to $82,368) and Midwest (3%, to $66,332).    Tax Changes Hit Groups   In Land Conservation   TAX OVERHAUL has crimped donations to tax exempt land-conservation groups, which are responding by launching rare fund drives.    Reductions in the top individual income-tax rate to 38.5% in 1987 and 28% this year from 50% in 1986 have shrunk the value to taxpayers of deductions for gifts of land or money to these organizations. As a result, the Nature Conservancy, a Washington, D.C.-based group that protects environmentally sensitive land, says it will be hard-pressed this year to match the 50,000 acres it received in 1987; that was down from 350,000 acres in 1986.    With contributions way down, some groups say they are shelving some land-conservation efforts. Among the postponed projects: the conservancy's proposed $15 million, 100,000-acre prairie preserve in Oklahoma, and a plan by the San Francisco-based Trust for Public Land to pay $3.5 million for 20 coastal acres on St. John in the U.S. Virgin Islands.    The trust's fund-raising efforts include a $600,000 campaign in the San Francisco area, one of several regional drives. The conservancy is considering a $250 million, five-year campaign; it would be only the second fund drive in the group's 40-year history.    MIT Program Trains   Minority Developers -   BLACK and Hispanic developers, many of whom build low-income housing units with federal contracts, have seen business dry up as federal funds for new housing have dropped to about $8 billion in each of the past two years from $30 billion as recently as 1981. But some of them say they lack the skills to move into other areas of real estate.    So last fall, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Center for Real Estate Development started a year-long training program for Boston-area minority developers. Among the course offerings: computer training, market analysis and deal-making. &quot;We did a lot of negotiating by the seat of our pants,&quot; recalls Kenneth I. Guscott, a developer who took the course. Now he says he can assemble more sophisticated financial projections and negotiate prices better.    The program is supported by grants from the city of Boston and MIT. The school says it is encouraged enough by the early results to consider expanding the program statewide. </TEXT></DOC>
