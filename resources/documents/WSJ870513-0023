Trouble is, it was &quot;not true.&quot;    That was the conclusion of federal Judge William C. Conner in a fiercely contested civil suit over Tylenol's ads brought against the brand's maker, Johnson andamp; Johnson, by rival American Home Products Corp. Judge Conner ruled that Johnson andamp; Johnson was guilty of making &quot;false and misleading&quot; advertising claims about its prized Tylenol product. He also said the company &quot;misleadingly exaggerated&quot; Tylenol's superiority over such competing pain-relief products as Anacin-3 and Advil, both marketed by American Home.    But the judge, who sits in U.S. District Court in Manhattan, also gave American Home a dose of the same medicine; some long-running Anacin-3 ads also weren't true, he said in his decision.    The judge decided to bar both companies from further offensive advertising. In an attempt to avoid appeals, he left it up to the companies' lawyers to agree on wording an injunction; so far they have failed to do that. As is common in civil cases, the first trial determined the facts but didn't award damages. There may be a second trial on damages, even though the judge said neither side would win enough to justify its trial costs.    The judge's 65-page ruling, issued after two years of filings and counterfilings and four weeks of testimony, is jarring to the $1.8 billion-a-year nonprescription analgesic market. Over-the-counter drugs are so similar that they rely almost totally on marketing for success. That's why drug companies have for years sued each other silly, hoping to put a dent in each other's niches.    &quot;Small nations have fought for their very survival with less resources and resourcefulness than these antagonists have brought to their epic struggle for commercial primacy in the over-the-counter analgesic field,&quot; Judge Conner said.    The case led Judge Conner to make some cutting observations on what happens when medicine and advertising mix.    Lesson 1:   Don't Be Fooled by Headlines and Pictures    Tylenol's &quot;rotten apple&quot; ad appeared in medical journals in 1985 before the company yanked it after doctors complained that it was in bad taste. It featured a large color picture of an apple infected by a rotted worm hole. The ad was an attempt by Tylenol to lump aspirin's renowned problems -- such as causing stomach upset -- with ibuprofen, the active ingredient in Advil and in Nuprin, made by Upjohn Co.    Below the headline, &quot;Aspirin and Ibuprofen -- The Closer You Look. . . ,&quot; are listed four nasty side effects: gastric ulcers, &quot;ulcer craters,&quot; gastrointestinal irritation and allergic reaction.    A closer look at the ad, though, reveals that of the four items, only allergic reaction is actually ascribed to ibuprofen.    Judge Conner ruled that the ad was indeed misleading enough to break the law, &quot;particularly when accompanied by dramatic and distasteful analogies, such as rotten fruit.&quot;    Johnson andamp; Johnson says the judge merely had a problem with how the ad -- aimed at medical professionals -- was &quot;laid out,&quot; not with the medical claims. &quot;Professionals would understand what we're saying there,&quot; says Jim Murray, a company spokesman. Adds Roger Fine, Johnson andamp; Johnson's associate general counsel, &quot;It goes to format rather than content.&quot;    Lesson 2:   Beware of Every Word, Even the Smallest Ones    One part of a series of Johnson andamp; Johnson print and television ads really caused a headache for the judge. The ad claimed that Tylenol provides relief &quot;without the stomach irritation you can get&quot; from aspirin or Advil.    The judge said that kind of phrasing is a clever way to mislead consumers. Saying &quot;the stomach irritation&quot; makes Advil and aspirin seem equally irritating, which isn't true, he said. Studies show that Advil is less irritating than aspirin.    Johnson andamp; Johnson now has found another way to lump ibuprofen (meaning Advil) with aspirin -- as in &quot;Tylenol doesn't irritate your stomach the way aspirin or even ibuprofen can.&quot; Similar effect, but legal.    Mr. Fine emphasizes that the Tylenol ads found misleading had been accurate when used and had been withdrawn voluntarily before the trial. &quot;We're continually reevaluating our ad claims in light of new medical evidence that might be helpful to consumers,&quot; he says. American Home declined comment on any details of the case on grounds it isn't over.    Lesson 3:   Numbers Don't Mean Much, Even the Big Ones    The judge said American Home was guilty of some &quot;commercial puffery,&quot; too. He noted the &quot;McDonald's-fashion&quot; ads for Advil that use such phrases as &quot;recommended over five million times for headaches and other kinds of pain&quot; -- even though only 2.4% of the doctors' recommendations were specifically for headache.    And the judge tweaked the contorted calculations behind an American Home slogan that &quot;70,000 doctors and dentists&quot; recommend Anacin-3. The company had sent free samples of Anacin-3 to 250,000 doctors, half of whom mailed in a post card that entitled them to more free samples. The company then surveyed 404 of that group, 65% of whom said they recommended Anacin-3. Multiplying 65%, by the total who mailed in post cards, the company proudly claimed that 70,000 doctors had recommended Anacin-3.    Besides, the judge said, most of the doctors &quot;recommending&quot; the product probably didn't do anything more than &quot;pass on to patients free samples which AHP had furnished them.&quot; Such action &quot;is certainly not a recommendation. . .,&quot; he added.    Still, the AHP ad isn't technically false, added the judge. Similarly, Johnson andamp; Johnson is able to claim in its ads that &quot;hospitals trust Tylenol&quot; because it makes sure hospitals consistently get the product more cheaply than competing products, which is why they use more of it, the judge said. And the judge concluded: &quot;What (American Home) has done is to carry (Tylenol's) scheme to its logical extreme and cut the price of Anacin-3 to doctors all the way to zero.&quot;    Lesson 4:   Know the Ingredients Behind the Brand    More misleading on American Home's part, according to the judge, is its slogan that hospitals recommend &quot;acetaminophen, the aspirin-free pain reliever in Anacin-3, more than any other pain reliever.&quot;    What most consumers might not know, though, is that Tylenol is the acetaminophen product that those hospitals recommend -- or at least pass along -- because of that favorable price they get on Tylenol.    Here's a more accurate, though less catchy, version of the slogan, courtesy of the judge: &quot;Hospitals have recommended a product containing acetaminophen more than all other types of pain reliever combined. Anacin-3 contains acetaminophen.&quot;    Lesson 5:   Repeating a Slogan Doesn't Make It True    Here's how Johnson andamp; Johnson tried to justify that famous Tylenol slogan (a slogan that the judge noted has been &quot;repeated with wearing persistence&quot;):    At the trial, company attorneys conceded that Extra-Strength Tylenol isn't &quot;more&quot; effective than Advil, but they insisted it is &quot;as&quot; effective, supposedly making the slogan true.    The judge plowed through a mountain of medical evidence on this one, finally declaring that for mild to moderate pain of a headache, there's no big difference between a two-tablet, 1,000 milligram dose of Extra-Strength Tylenol and a two-tablet 400 milligram dose of Advil. The same dose of Advil, though, is more potent for severe pain, although that added potency (with added risk of side effects) isn't necessarily needed for a simple headache.    Thus, another of the judge's stabs at an honest slogan: &quot;For mild to moderate pain, you can't buy a more effective pain reliever without a prescription.&quot;    Spruce that up and you get Tylenol's current slogan: &quot;Nothing you can take without a prescription is more effective for headache than Extra-Strength Tylenol.&quot;    Johnson andamp; Johnson doesn't give credit to the judge, though. It says it stopped using the famous slogan in January 1986 to get away from the &quot;more potent&quot; phrasing in favor of the &quot;more effective&quot; phrasing. Anyway, it adds, potency to fight severe pain is irrelevant in the &quot;over-the-counter pain&quot; market for which Tylenol is intended. </TEXT></DOC>
