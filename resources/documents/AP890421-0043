Kemp, who has encouraged efforts to rid public housing of drugusers and sellers, said Thursday that in some cases parents may beunable to control older, physically strong children who are engagedin drug activity. In those cases, he said, ``I don't think Mom andDad should be punished'' by eviction.   But he said there are cases where mothers or other heads offamilies are participants in drug enterprises, sometimes with theirchildren.   ``Let the tenants and the (public housing agencies) throw themout,'' the secretary of Housing and Urban Development said. ``Onthe first, first _ one, one _ time you're caught doing, dealing,engaging in drug traffic, I would say, out.''</TEXT><NOTE>___</NOTE><NOTE>U.S. Serious About Halting Drift-netting</NOTE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Coast Guard boarding of a Taiwanese shipsuspected of illegal drift-netting demonstrates U.S. concern over afishing technique that can wipe out large numbers of sea creatures,a State Department official says.   ``This is a very serious matter and it would be anunderstatement to say this heightens the issue,'' Ed Wolfe, theState Department's ambassador for oceans and fisheries, saidThursday. ``The U.S. position is there should be no drift-netfishing at all. It is wasteful and inefficient.''   An estimated 700 fishing boats from Taiwan, South Korea andJapan have been using drift-nets in the northern Pacific Ocean tocatch squid since the early 1980s. The nets are up to 35 miles longand can cover more than 30,000 square miles of ocean.   U.S. fishermen charge the nets snare North American salmon andthe illegal catches have already impacted fish runs in Alaska,Washington state and Oregon.   Coast Guard officers boarded the Taiwanese ship the Cyi Yang No.1 late Wednesday in the Pacific Ocean hundreds of miles southwestof the Aleutian Islands because of the use of drift-netting.</TEXT></DOC>
