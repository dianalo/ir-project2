Mr. Dukakis has promised to effectively kill it in declaring SDI a &quot;fantasy and a fraud&quot; and pledging to slash the SDI research budget. Mr. Bush has promised nothing but indicated that he will continue to equivocate on SDI, stating that &quot;when it is ready I'll deploy it&quot; but never saying what it has to be ready to do. Considering the ineptitude of the Reagan administration in explaining what SDI has to do to justify its deployment, there is small chance a Bush administration would be able to convince a Democratic Congress of the need to deploy.    All of this points to the very high probability that unless President Reagan takes some decisive measures on SDI before the next president is elected, the future of the program will be bleak indeed. Only Mr. Reagan can save SDI, and only by accepting the one application he has thus far rejected: the ALPS (accidental launch protection system) proposal made earlier this year by Sen. Sam Nunn (D., Ga.).    As envisaged by Mr. Nunn, ALPS would be a limited anti-ballistic missile system designed primarily to defend the U.S. against an accidental launch of intercontinental ballistic missiles. Compared with a full-scale SDI deployment, ALPS would be of relatively modest cost ($10 billion to $20 billion) and more quickly available (within five years). If accepted and pushed by Mr. Reagan, not only would ALPS provide a badly needed defensive capability but it would offer the best prospects for keeping SDI alive with bipartisan congressional support.    The U.S. military, fearing that ALPS deployment will cut into other military programs, generally has resisted this proposal on the ground that the threat is not sufficiently high to justify such protection. As Adm. William Crowe, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, has said, the risk of accidental launch is &quot;very, very low.&quot; What the admiral has not discussed, however, are the societal consequences for the U.S. if an accidental launch ever were to occur and some very, very low number of thermonuclear warheads detonated on American soil. Considering the world-wide impact of the Chernobyl nuclear reactor accident, it is hard to believe that the effect on the U.S. would be anything less than catastrophic -- perhaps the greatest disaster in American history.    Adm. Crowe has missed the crucial point: Without an ALPS defense, the magnitude of the consequences far outweighs the magnitude of the threat. And the effectiveness of ALPS against a very limited inadvertent attack would be far greater than that of an SDI system designed against a full-scale deliberate attack.    For even better reasons than those of the U.S., the Soviets should desire an ALPS capability of their own. They already have a limited capability in the form of their ABM deployment around Moscow, and many intelligence analysts believe they are preparing for a nationwide deployment that would incorporate an ALPS role. (One should keep in mind that the Soviets maintain the world's most extensive air defense system, which gives them very high assurance of coping with an unauthorized nuclear bomber attack.) In this connection, the Soviets' refusal to dismantle the radar at Krasnoyarsk, which is a flagrant violation of the ABM Treaty denounced by Congress, is highly indicative of their longstanding dedication to the defense of their country.    The best thing Mr. Reagan could do for his country during the remainder of his presidency would be to renegotiate the ABM Treaty to allow both sides to acquire ALPS capability. In so doing, the U.S. would concede Krasnoyarsk to the Soviets, which in essence the Reagan administration already has done, while gaining the right to establish its own ALPS-directed radar system.    In negotiating such an agreement, the president should go one step further: He should offer, as he did five years ago at the time of his famous &quot;Stars Wars&quot; speech, to share with the Soviets all U.S. technology on ALPS. It is in the best interests of both sides to make as certain as possible that neither side's nuclear warheads accidentally strike either side -- not only because of the horror of such an event, but because such an event could trigger nuclear war. Such an arrangement would be far more effective toward averting nuclear catastrophe than the &quot;Hot Line&quot; communications system.    Could such an arrangement be worked out with the Soviets before Nov. 8? Considering how close Mr. Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev allegedly came to reaching a Start agreement at Reykjavik after only a couple of days, well, why not?    The U.S. found out when it signed the 1972 ABM Treaty that signing an agreement that denies it defense accomplishes exactly that. Until Mr. Reagan created SDI, the U.S. level of ABM research and development was woefully inadequate. So why not try to reach an agreement that permits, even encourages, a defensive capability that enhances (not reduces, as foes claim will be the case for SDI) national security?    Based on their remarks to date, it seems clear that when they debate the future of SDI, candidates Dukakis and Bush will do so almost meaninglessly. But President Reagan, if he wants to give SDI a meaningful future, can pre-empt such desultory debate by moving toward the quick consummation of an ALPS agreement. If ALPS can become a priority program before the elections, this would best enhance the possibility that SDI can survive.    ---   Mr. Cohen, a retired nuclear-weapons analyst, invented the neutron bomb. </TEXT></DOC>
