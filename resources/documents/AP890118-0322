But the news that the trade imbalance was the biggest in fivemonths and higher than advance predictions had little impact onfinancial markets, which posted strong performances.   The stock market rose in heavy trading, with the Dow Jonesaverage of 30 industrials climbed 24.11 to 2,238.75, surpassing itspost-crash peak of 2,226.07 it reached last Friday.   Some of the power driving equities higher came from thesurprising resilience of the dollar. Frequently in the past, a poortrade report induced currency dealers to dump dollars but onWednesday heavy buying pushed the dollar higher against most leadingcurrencies.   Taking a cue from the currency markets, bond prices rose with thebenchmark 30-year Treasury bond gaining nearly $7 for each $1,000 inface value.   In commodity markets, crude oil futures continued their recentrally and pierced the important psychological level of $19 a barrel.On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the February contract for WestTexas Intermediate, the key grade of U.S. crude, settled at $19.26 abarrel, up 31 cents from Tuesday.   The Commerce Department trade report said the gap was 22 percentlarger than October's $10.3 billion deficit, reflecting a surge inimports, particularly for business capital goods, and a slight dropin exports.   ``We have a serious competitiveness problem in this country,''said Lawrence Chimerine, head of the WEFA Group, an economicconsulting firm in Bala Cynwyd, Pa. ``There's a limit to how muchyou can improve by cutting costs and driving the dollar lower.''   At the White House, spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the Novemberperformance was of concern but ``we trust this is an aberration anddoes not change the overall trend.''   Even with the November deterioration, the trade deficit for thefirst 11 months of 1988 was running at an annual rate of $137.3billion, almost 20 percent below the all-time imbalance of $170.3billion set in 1987.   Departing Commerce Secretary C. William Verity, a topadministration trade expert, said the November report wasdisappointing evidence that the country's trade problems are farfrom being solved. He said the rapid pace of improvement in thefirst part of 1988 had leveled off in recent months.   ``All of this means that we have a long way to go,'' Verity saidin a statement. ``We must continue to improve our efficiency andquality at home and pursue our efforts to reduce trade barriersabroad.''   In brighter economic news, the Federal Reserve Board reportedthat U.S. industry operated at 84.2 percent of capacity in December,the highest rate in nine years.   Much of the increase reflected the boom U.S. manufacturers haveenjoyed in export sales as the weaker dollar made their productscompetitive once more on overseas markets.   However, analysts said the November trade report showed thatuntil Americans' appetite for imports is curbed, the trade imbalancewill remain stuck in the $130 billion-a-year range, furtherincreasing the country's dependency on foreign investment asAmericans hand over billions of dollars every year to foreigners inexchange for cars, televisions and other imported products.   President-elect Bush faces the problem of trying to improveAmerica's trade balance in order to keep the economic recoveryalive. But analysts said he must accomplish that task withouterecting more trade barriers and further worsening global tradingtensions.   ``The trade report is disturbing. It is evidence that for thelast seven months we haven't made any progress on the tradeadjustment process,'' said Bruce Steinberg, senior economist atMerrill Lynch in New York.   The November deficit was the largest since a $13.2 billion Juneimbalance. November's deficit reflected a big jump in imports, whichshot up to $39.7 billion, $1.6 billion above the October level andthe second highest level on record. Exports fell by $639 million to$27.2 billion.   Many economists believe that the U.S. dollar, which actually rosea bit in the last year, will have to decline further to spur moreexport gains.   For November, the 4.2 percent rise in imports reflected bigincreases in shipments of business capital equipment, which rose by$1.1 billion, and consumer goods, which climbed by $697 million.   The auto category actually dropped by $229 million duringNovember and the nation's oil bill fell a slight 0.4 percent to$3.13 billion, reflecting a drop in both the amount of oil importedand the price, which edged down to an average of $13.38 per barrel.   The rise in capital goods reflected increases in U.S. purchasesof iron and steel products, airplanes and heavy equipment such asmetal working machinery. Faced with high operating rates, Americanindustry has been rushing to expand production facilities. In manycases, however, the new equipment has been purchased from overseassuppliers.   The 2.3 percent drop in exports in November reflected declines insales of U.S. farm products and capital goods.</TEXT></DOC>
