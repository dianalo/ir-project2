Fe-based or Ni-based alloysand electric conductive ceramics for electrodes, and non or ionic conductiveceramics for electrolyte matrix were investigated. Over a hundred kindsof materials have been surveyed so far. Corrosion products on each specimenwas investigated by SEM photograph and X-ray analysis. In addition, corrosiontests of a wide variety of oxides were carried out and the oxides wereanalyzed by XRD.</TEXT></DOC>
