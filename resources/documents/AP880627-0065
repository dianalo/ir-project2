Jackson's conciliatory tone came after the Dukakis forcesprevailed at a weekend party meeting on the platform in keeping theparty's statement on issues broad on principles and short onspecifics.   Jackson, interviewed today from Chicago on ABC-TV's ``GoodMorning America,'' said he is meeting with campaign aides today todiscuss what issues his more than 1,100 delegates will press for atthe convention next month in Atlanta.   ``In some measure, our mission is to find common ground in thecommittee structure,'' Jackson said. ``Where that cannot takeplace, we'll take it to the floor and simply let the people air itout in the public. That's healthy for our party. Better we be onthe floor debating than outside dividing in this context,'' he said.   Also today, Rep. William Gray III of Pennsylvania, a Jacksonsupporter who chaired the platform committee meeting, saidJackson's forces had an impact even if they didn't carry severalkey issues votes.   ``I think there are a lot of things in this platform that arethe result of Jesse Jackson's leadership in the debate in 1988 inthe presidential primaries,'' Gray, interviewed in Washington, saidon the CBS-TV ``This Morning'' program.   ``What we were trying to do was pull together all the elementsof the Democratic Party and it's the result of all those elementscoming together and stating what are the broad principles,'' Graysaid.   Looking ahead to fights over such issues as higher taxes and hiscall for a freeze on military spending, Jackson said any fight hewages over the platform ``is not to make it just loud forexcitement, but to deal with a direction that will make adifference.''   Both the Dukakis and Jackson strategists left the DemocraticPlatform Committee meeting boasting of party unity and the commonground they reached.   But on key areas where there was no consensus, the majorityDukakis delegates stood their ground and resisted Jackson planks. AJackson budget package, combining both his call for higher taxes onthe wealthy and a Pentagon freeze, went down, 108-44, in the onlystand-up vote.   All other amendments were handled by voice votes, adding to theatmosphere of harmony.   In San Juan, Puerto Rico, Jackson told reporters: ``There willno doubt be some minority positions taken to the floor.'' But hesaid it was too early to say which issues.   ``I do not think that bland is beautiful,'' Jackson said lateras he campaigned in St. Croix in the U.S. Virgin Islands. ``Peopleought to be specific, ought to make promises, ought to keeppromises, ought to make commitments. People have given us amandate.''   The platform committee also rejected Jackson amendments seekingto double the education budget, commit the United States tono-first-use of nuclear weapons, and call for Palestinianself-determination.   The platform vows the Democrats will ``restore competence,caring and incorruptibility'' to Washington and ``reverse sevenyears of `voodoo economics,' `trickle down' policies and fiscalirresponsibility.''   It does not mention taxes or say how the Democrats will reducethe deficit.   Many passages bore the stamp of Jackson. The document calls foran indexed minimum wage, terms South Africa a terrorist stat, slapsat corporate raiders and endorses same-day and mail-in voterregistration.   The committee also accepted less controversial Jacksonamendments, including calls for Third World debt relief andsignificant increases in child care aid for low- and middle-incomefamilies.   ``About 95 percent of all the issues that came up between thesetwo campaigns have been resolved in a peaceful and in a unifiedway, and I know that scares the Republicans to death,'' formerGary, Ind., Mayor Richard Hatcher, a Jackson campaign leader, saidSaturday.   Paul G. Kirk Jr., the party chairman, said in a statement fromWashington: ``Common-sense politics has given us a short statementof principle all Democrats can run on in November.''   Michael Barnes, who led Dukaki's platform team, said theplacidity of the platform writing indicates ``the Democratic partyreally has matured and is ready to take the reins of government.''   ``There may be in Atlanta some further discussion of theseissues,'' said Barnes, a former Maryland congressman. ``That'snormal. But I'm confident that if there is, it will be done in thesame spirit we saw here in Denver.''   Eleanor Holmes Norton, Jackson's platform chief, said inweighing floor fights, Jackson must decide which issues are``icing'' and which are worth risking a divisive debate.   Norton, a Georgetown University law professor, said thedifferences between Dukakis and Jackson have not evaporated, but``the governor and the Reverend in these proceedings moved closertogether.''   Rep. Tom Bevill, D-Ala., summed up the reason for vagueness inthe platform Saturday during debate the amendment pledging no firstuse of nuclear weapons.   ``We have an old saying there on the floor of the House,'' hesaid. ``Nobody, no member of Congress, has ever been defeatedbecause of something he didn't say.''</TEXT></DOC>
