Broken Hill Proprietary Co. said a consortium including Broken Hill, Financier Alan Bond's Bond Corp. and Comalco Ltd., was formed to study whether a rocket-launch facility should be built in Queensland. Broken Hill said the project could use existing facilities at a Comalco bauxite mine at Australia's northernmost tip.    Preliminary cost estimates for the project vary from 1.5 billion Australian dollars ($1.11 billion) to six billion dollars.    Martin Marietta, an aerospace, electronics and information systems company, said it is involved in the study because of its work at the U.S. launch sites in California and Florida. The company, which builds the Titan rocket, entered the commercial space-launch business last year and now has agreements to loft 19 communications satellites. </TEXT></DOC>
