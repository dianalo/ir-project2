Botha marked theAfrikaners' most sacred day Friday by calling for racial cooperationin South Africa, but a rival celebration by rightist Afrikanersprotested recent racial reforms.   Friday marked the 150th anniversary of the Great Trek that tookwhite settlers into the African wilderness on wagons drawn by oxen.   ``We must strive for national unity and for unity in ourdifferent communities,'' Botha told whites gathered at theVoortrekker Monument, dedicated to the 19th century settlers.   People from throughout the country arrived in Pretoria on wagonsthis week to commemorate the 1838 Great Trek.   During the original journey, one of the pioneer parties vowed onDec. 16, 1838 to make the date sacred if it defeated the Zulu armyled by King Dingaan. They did so in the Battle of Blood River.   ``White, brown and black stood together in the laager (circledwagons) at Blood River, in spite of those who want to suppress thisfact today in an attempt to justify their own standpoints,'' Bothasaid.   His call for unity and his acknowledgement that blacksparticipated in the trek and fought the Zulus contrasted sharplywith the rival celebration staged nearby by rightist Afrikaners, whoview Botha's recent limited racial reforms as capitulation to thenation's 26 million black majority.   Botha's National Party calls for gradual race reforms and limitedpower-sharing, while the right-wing Afrikaners oppose all suchreform.   ``This is a demonstration, a protest of the Afrikaner againstwhat is going on in South Africa, so-called reform,'' said CarelBoshoff, leader of the Afrikaner Volkswag, a cultural groupsponsoring the alternative celebrations.   ``We do not see (race reform) only as political change, but totalcultural change,'' Boshoff said in an interview. ``We don't thinkit's possible for the (white) South African nation to survive inthat situation.''   Both celebrations drew about 10,000 people Friday.   The Great Trek, the most momentous event in Afrikaner history,began in 1838 when the Dutch-descended Afrikaners left theBritish-ruled Cape Colony for the country's uncharted interior.   Stories about hardships on the journey and battles with Africantribesmen have taken on mythical proportions for the country's 3million Afrikaners, who dominate the government and make up about 60percent of the white population.   The government billed its Great Trek celebrations as open to allraces, but only a handful of blacks participated _ as drivers of theoxen teams.   The far-right groups barred blacks from attending theirceremonies.   The right-wing groups staged a mock Battle of Blood River, withseveral dozen bearded men in buckskin outfits taking cover behindwagons to defeat imaginary Zulu warriors. There were no actual blackopponents present, only a taped recording of Zulu war cries anddrumbeats.   Andries Treurnicht, leader of the Conservative Party, the chiefParliamentary opposition, told the right-wing rally: ``It is theright of the Afrikaner nation to be ruled by its own people.''   ``If Europe's nationalities have the right to live in separatecountries, what is wrong with the white South African nation livingapart from the non-whites?'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
