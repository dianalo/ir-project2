He also called on the presidents of El Salvador, Costa Rica,Guatemala and Honduras to resume talks on a Central American peaceplan. Ortega and the four other presidents last met in January.   ``The Nicaraguan government extends until Sept. 30 the halt tooffensive military operations ... so the rebels can put down theirarms and accept amnesty,'' Ortega said in a speech to a group ofIndian leaders in Managua.   The rebels, known as Contras, and the Sandinista governmentfirst agreed to a cease-fire on March 21. Two days later theysigned a pact agreeing to negotiate an end to the the 7-year-oldwar.   Ortega's extension was the fourth of a formal 60-day truce thattook effect April 1. The U.S.-backed Contras said in June theywould observe the cease-fire indefinitely.   Both sides have accused the other of violating the truce.   A series of political talks to negotiate a permanent cease-fireand pave the way for a peace settlement broke off June 9.   Under the regional peace plan signed by the five CentralAmerican presidents in August 1987, the Contras would lay downtheir arms in exchange for concrete democratic measures by theSandinistas.   There were these other developments:   _Two Nicaraguan politicians left Managua Monday and went toMiami to discuss with Contra leaders the release of politicalprisoners.   Erick Ramirez and Mauricio Diaz are members of the NationalReconciliation Commission set up under last year's peace plan.   Ramirez said one issue is the fate of 75 Sandinista soldiersheld by the Contras as prisoners of war. He said the rebelsacknowledge holding the soldiers and have agreed to free them butdetails must be worked out.   Ramirez also said he had a list of names of more than 600Nicaraguans whose whereabouts are unknown.   _The archbishop of Managua, in an interview broadcast on theVatican City's radio station, said human rights violations arecontinuing in Nicaragua despite the cease-fire.   Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo said, ``As for the war, thefighting has diminished, but there are still, unfortunately, deathson both sides. Human rights violations continue and we are workingas men, Christians and pastors so that life is protected.''   ``The truce has saved lives,'' he added, ``but many things havenot been realized. In my opinion, what is lacking is thefundamental thing: Full democracy.''</TEXT></DOC>
