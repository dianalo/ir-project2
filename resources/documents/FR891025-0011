This action does not fall within the scope of the Regulatory FlexibilityAct. REA has concluded that promulgation of this rule would not representa major Federal action significantly affecting the quality of the humanenvironment under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.SC 4321 et seq. (1976)) and, therefore, does not require an environmentalimpact statement or an environmental assessment. This program is listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance underNo. 10.851, Rural Telephone Loans and Loan Guarantees, and 10.852, RuralTelephone Bank Loans. For the reasons set forth in the final rule relatedNotice to 7 CFR part 3015, subpart V (50 FR 47034, November 14, 1985),this program is excluded from the scope of Executive Order 12372 whichrequires intergovernmental consultation with State and local officials.The reporting and recordkeeping provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Actof 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3507 et seq.) contained in this rule have been approvedby the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under clearance number 0572-0062.<ITAG tagnum="84">Background</ITAG>REA has issued a series of 7 CFR chapter XVII parts which serve to implementthe policies, procedures, and requirements for administering its loan andloan guarantee programs and the security instruments which provide forand secure REA financing. The proposed revision to 7 CFR part 1762 is utilizedto announce revisions of the Central Office Equipment Contract (IncludingInstallation) REA Form 525. The 7 CFR part 1762 also provides informationas to where copies of the contract may be obtained and the price per copy,where applicable. REA Form 525 is a labor and materials contract whereinthe contractor furnishes all labor and materials required for the installationof telephone central office equipment. REA telephone borrowers are requiredto use the Form 525 Contract where major central office facilities arebeing procured and installed by the contract method. REA Form 525 has becomeoutdated due to technological advancements and other market changes. Advancedtechnology and equipment concepts have introduced new legal issues thatneed to be addressed. Contract terms and obligations need to be modifiedand updated to more accurately reflect present business practices. Somerepresentative issues that need to be addressed in updating this contractare: expansion of patent infringement protection to include copyrights,trademarks, etc.; software right-to-use licensing terms, warranty coverage;use of information, consequential damages; delays in project; liquidateddamages; bonding and insurance, independent contractor provisions; andsupport of discontinued products.
