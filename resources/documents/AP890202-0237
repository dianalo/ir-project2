The government, meanwhile, said it has found new evidence that arevolt was imminent and said the developments ``justify urgentgovernment measures.''   The independent Radio Metropole said the students in Gonaivescharged that the government was looking for an excuse to crack downon peasants and opposition leaders.   Tires were set afire in some Gonaives streets, but no violencewas reported in the city.   The protest came after a memo from Information Minister AnthonySaint-Pierre advised Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril, the country's militaryruler, that the Communist Party and other leftist groups wereplanning an armed insurrection with large landowners.   The memo said the rebellion was being supported by the RomanCatholic Church, according to Haitian radio stations.   The memorandum, dated Jan. 13, alleged the insurrection wouldoccur ``in the next few days'' and recommended that it be put down``by force and even with bloodshed.''   Col. Carl Dorsainvil, the defense and interior minister, backedthe earlier memo said in a new statement.   ``This report provoked the immediate creation of an investigationcommission. The first results have confirmed the existence ofcertain problems which really justify urgent government measures,''said a communique signed by Dorsainvil and broadcast by severalradio stations Thursday.   Late Wednesday, nine political and union leaders, in a jointstatement broadcast by independent Radio Metropole, called forAvril's resignation, saying he ``has shown his determination toperpetuate the autocratic and bloody Duvalierist regime.''   Dictator Jean-Claude Duvalier fled to France in 1986, ending a29-year family dynasty.   In his memorandum, Saint-Pierre charged that the ``peasantinsurrection'' was being led by the Peasant Movement of Papaye inHaiti's Central Plateau with help from the Congress of DemocraticForces, an umbrella group of several leftist organizations.   Victor Benoit, the group's co-leader who was named bySaint-Pierre as an instigator of the uprising, also deniedinvolvement and said Thursday he would sue the information minister.   ``Today, the life of every democrat in this country isthreatened,'' Benoit said on independent Radio Haiti Inter.   About 80 percent of Haitians are impoverished peasants, and manyof them work for wealthy landowners. In July 1987 about 300 landlesspeasants demanding land reform near the northwest town of Jean Rabelwere killed in a clash with sharecroppers working for landowners.   Avril became president after soldiers, demanding a return todemocracy, ousted former ruler Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy on Sept. 17.Namphy came to power after Duvalier left in 1986.</TEXT></DOC>
