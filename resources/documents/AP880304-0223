In the seven selling days from Feb. 21-29, GM sold 127,549domestic cars, up 33.4 percent from a year earlier, and 59,709domestic light trucks, up 46.2 percent from a year earlier.   GM said its sales during the final third of February were itshighest for that period since 1972.   Among all eight companies that build cars and trucks in theUnited States, sales totaled 378,308 in late February, up from302,642 a year ago.   Aiding sales were the weaker dollar, which pushes prices ofimports higher, and what some analysts said was stronger consumeractivity.   ``Consumer confidence continues to strengthen and is nowapproaching levels prior to the October stock market collapse. Weare optimistic about the (vehicle) market for March and the springselling season,'' said C.N. Moore, GM vice president for customersales and service.   Domestic car sales totaled 246,742 during late February, up 24.1percent from 198,818 a year ago. Domestic light truck sales were131,566, up 26.7 percent from 103,824 in late February 1987, thecompanies reported.   For the entire month, combined import car and light truck salesfell 4.4 percent from February 1987 while sales of domesticvehicles rose 13.9 percent. Higher prices helped push sales ofJapanese cars 4.1 percent lower and European cars 6.1 percent loweragainst a year ago.   Foreign automakers have been forced to raise prices to accountfor the foreign exchange decline of the dollar since 1985.   ``The domestics are going after market share...starting to takeadvantage of the import weakness. Not only have they held downprices, but they have very heavy incentive campaigns,'' said ThomasO'Grady, industry analyst with Integrated Automotive Resources Inc.in Wayne, Pa.   Total car and light truck sales, imported and domestic, rose17.7 percent in February to 2,406,215 from 2,044,426 a year ago.Sales are compared on the basis of daily average sales duringFebruary, which had 25 selling days this year and 24 last year.   Korean car sales rose 76.4 percent, continuing an unbroken trendthat began when Hyundai Motor Corp. entered the market in 1986.   Unlike the currencies of Japan and most western Europeannations, the Korean won has not risen against the U.S. dollar, soKorean cars remain relatively inexpensive in this country.   Of the four Korean makes on the market, two are imported by U.S.makers _ the Ford Festiva and GM's Pontiac LeMans _ and one isimported by Japan's Mitsubishi Motors Corp.   In late February, car sales increased from a year ago for alldomestic makers except Nissan Motor Corp., whose sales plunged 44.2percent to 1,955 from 3,501 a year ago.   Nissan also was the only domestic maker to sell fewer lighttrucks during the period. Nissan's domestic light trucks sales fell2.5 percent to 2,633 from 2,701 a year ago.   Ford Motor Co.'s domestic car sales rose 18.7 percent to 61,049from 51,411 a year ago. Ford's domestic truck sales were up 10.8percent, to 41,599 from 37,559 a year ago.   No. 3 Chrysler Corp.'s domestic car sales rose 18.8 percent, to37,481 from 31,560 a year ago. Chrysler's domestic truck sales rose21.6 percent, to 27,625 from 22,715 in late February 1987.   Honda Motor Co., Volkswagen of America Inc. and Toyota MotorCorp. also reported increased sales from a year ago. Mazda MotorCorp. began assembling cars in the United States last fall.</TEXT></DOC>
