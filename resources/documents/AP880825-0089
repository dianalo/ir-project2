Pushing what chief of staff Craig Fuller called ``a winningissue for us,'' Bush jumped on Dukakis on Wednesday for vetoing a1977 Massachusetts bill that would have required teachers to leadchildren in saying the pledge.   ``I would have signed that bill,'' the vice president, withPresident Reagan on the stage, told some 3,000 Republicans packedinto a Los Angeles hotel rally replete with celebrities and red,white and blue balloons.   The attorney general of Massachusetts jumped to the defense ofDukakis today, telling a television interviewer that the billDukakis vetoed would have imposed criminal penalties on teacherswho declined to lead their classes in the pledge, even if they didso because of their religious convictions.   Attorney General James Shannon, a Dukakis supporter, also saidon ABC's ``Good Morning America'' that in the last decade, thestate's governors have obeyed all 25 advisory opinions theMassachusetts Supreme Court has issued on pending legislation.   ``He did what he should have done under our system,'' Shannonsaid. ``We have a constitutional system and he took an oath touphold the Constitution.''   Bush and Reagan, rarely seen together, did a political tap-danceon the Massachusetts Democratic governor who is trying to recapturethe White House after nearly eight years of Republican rule.   Bush flew to his adopted home state of Texas afterward, and thevice president planned campaign appearances in San Antonio,Longview and Dallas over the next three days.   Bush had Republican National Convention delegates in New Orleansjoin him in reciting the Pledge of Allegiance as he concluded hisnomination acceptance speech a week ago.   Vice presidential aides at the time would not say why Bush hadended his speech in this unusual fashion, although media consultantRoger Ailes barked to a reporter, ``That's the way he lives.''   Now the Bush campaign leadership thinks it has found an issuefor the vice president to seize upon. In fact, Bush concluded acampaign rally Monday in Spokane, Wash., with the Pledge ofAllegiance.   Dukakis told reporters Tuesday he says the Pledge of Allegiancehimself and would urge children to do so, but said the questionbefore him was whether a governor or any other chief executivecould sign into law a bill they knew to be constitutionallydefective because of previous court rulings.   ``If the vice president is saying he'd sign an unconstitutionalbill, then in my judgment, he's not fit to hold the office,''Dukakis said Tuesday.   Striking back, Bush said he would sign such a bill and let theSupreme Court wrestle with the constitutional question.   Bush said that Gov. Jim Thompson, R-Ill., had faced a similarpiece of legislation, and had signed it.   ``Let's face it, my opponent was looking for a reason not tosign that bill,'' he said. ``I would have to look for a reason tosign that legislation.''   Bush said it was ``hard for me to imagine'' that the framers ofthe Constitution would have considered it a violation of anyone'sconstitutional rights to be present for a recitation of the Pledgeof Allegiance.   ``I just don't believe that was their concept when they wrotethe Constitution for our great country,'' he said.   The sponsors of the Reagan-Bush show had lined up an all-starcast of celebrities to serve as warm-ups, including comedian BobHope, actress Cheryl Ladd, actor Charlton Heston and singersTiffany and Pat Boone.   Reagan addressed directly for the first time a question that hashovered about Bush ever since he made his presidential ambitionsknown _ his reputation for having failed to make his presence knownas vice president.   ``I once said that he is a great vice president,'' Reagan said,``but I know and I've seen that it didn't come easily.''   ``George Bush is a man of action _ a man accustomed tocommand,'' he said. ``The vice presidency doesn't fit easily onsuch a man. But George Bush is also a patriot. And so he made itfit.''   Reagan said that ``day in, day out, I have sought George Bush'scounsel from the very first day of our administration. ... No onehas been closer to my side and has contributed more to oursuccesses.''</TEXT></DOC>
