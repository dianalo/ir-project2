Even then, a disruption -- and use of the reserve -- couldbe averted by an increased draw-down of commercial domesticstocks and higher production from such countries as SaudiArabia and Venezuela, he said.</LP><TEXT>   Some lawmakers and oil-industry officials have been urgingthe Bush administration to sell oil from the reserve to helpcalm oil markets and bring down prices. Bush administrationofficials, however, have said they don't want the governmentto get involved in influencing oil prices and fear thatdipping into the reserves would take pressure off SaudiArabia and other oil-producing countries to pump additionalcrude. However, an outbreak of fighting in the region couldforce the U.S. to tap the reserve.   In an interview, Mr. Moore said his view on the timing ofany disruption is consistent with the views of officials fromother countries in the 21-nation International Energy Agencyand with the U.S. experience during the oil shock of 1973.&quot;The level of stocks world-wide is high,&quot; he said. &quot;The lossof crude really hasn't been felt yet. It's been handled bythe drawdown in private stocks.&quot;   Since Iraq invaded Kuwait, the world oil markets have lostthe two countries' production of about four million barrels aday. Mr. Moore said domestic stocks of crude oil and fuel oilremain higher than usual, while supplies of gasoline arelower than usual. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve holds about590 million barrels of crude oil, which equals about 800 daysof U.S. imports from Iraq and Kuwait.   In addition, Mr. Moore said the Energy Department isworking to come up with additional ways of boosting domesticproduction, increasing conservation and encouraging industryto use fuels other than oil. Mr. Moore said the department isconsidering steps that would be longer-term and morecontroversial than its first package, though he wouldn'telaborate.   As part of the first plan, the administration announcedthat oil companies have agreed to boost production from theNorth Slope of Alaska; urged Americans to put more air inautomobile tires and increase car-pooling; and said it wouldmediate a California dispute that is blocking production of200 million to 300 million barrels of oil.   Mr. Moore said the department is working with the WhiteHouse on ways to get the conservation message out through apublic-information campaign.   The Bush administration does plan to renew its push fortax incentives to encourage domestic oil and gas production,including changes that would reduce the burden of thealternative minimum tax on producers. In the administration'sbudget proposal last January, the various tax changes aimedat the industry were estimated to cost $300 million in thefiscal year starting Oct. 1.   Mr. Moore was hopeful that the Mideast crisis might promptenvironmentalists and other opponents of drilling in theAlaska National Wildlife Refuge to reconsider the situation.   The department doesn't plan to recommend a reversal ofPresident Bush's decision to delay oil drilling inenvironmentally sensitive areas off the California andFlorida coasts. &quot;Even if we withdrew the decision tomorrow,there would still be two to five years of environmental work&quot;and other preparation before drilling could start, he said,so it would be of little use in the current crisis.   Similarly, the department isn't planning to push theFederal Energy Regulatory Commission to speed up itsconsideration of a proposed Iroquois pipeline to bringCanadian natural gas to the Northeastern U.S.   Mr. Moore predicted that Congress will return from itsAugust recess &quot;flush with legislative ideas to solve thecrisis.&quot; Among those will be a push to require auto makers toimprove significantly the fuel economy of their fleets. Whilehe said the administration would have to take a look at thisand other proposals, he gave no indication that the WhiteHouse will reverse its opposition to the measure, pushed bySen. Richard Bryan (D., Nev.).</TEXT></DOC>
