The petition was filed in April by the six New England states,New York, New Jersey, Minnesota and four environmental groups. Inaddition, the Canadian province of Ontario filed a separatepetition.   Don Clay, EPA's acting assistant administrator for airpollution, wrote the states and environmental groups saying, ``Itwould be premature to rule on your petition at this time,'' theagency announced.   A similar letter was sent to Ontario.   In the last days of the Carter administration in 1981, EPAAdministrator Douglas Costle wrote Secretary of State Ed Muskiethat sulfur dioxide emissions originating in the United States were``endangering'' Canada.   These emissions help form acid rain, which environmentalists sayis killing aquatic life in lakes in sensitive watersheds of theNortheast, the Upper Midwest and in eastern Canada.   The Reagan administration did nothing about the letter, thoughthe states, environmental groups and Canada argued that ittriggered an obligation under the Clean Air Act for EPA to forcestates to rewrite their air pollution control plans to reduce theemissions harming Canada.   A federal appeals court ruled against the states, holding thatCostle's letter was not a formal enough finding of harm to Canadato trigger a requirement forcing states to act. Such a finding mustbe arrived at through regulations requiring notice to all partiesinvolved and a chance to comment, and the states could request sucha proceeding, the court said.   Some of the states in July lost a separate but related suitclaiming that sulfur dioxide originating in power plant andindustrial smokestacks of the Midwest made it impossible for themto meet federal clean air standards in their own territories.   ``I do not believe that EPA presently has sufficient informationto undertake the regulatory program required (if the petition weregranted), including the endangerment finding requested in yourpetition,'' Clay wrote.   Clay said his letter ``does not necessarily reflect the positionof the administrator,'' but ``I cannot recommend that theadministrator take the discretionary action of making thefindings.''   In New York City, David Wooley, assistant state attorneygeneral, said Clay's assertion of insufficient information was``pure rubbish.''   Wooley said the letter appears to be formal enough to be thebasis of another lawsuit, ``And that's what I'm going to recommendto the nine states,'' Wooley said.</TEXT></DOC>
