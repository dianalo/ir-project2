In 1987, the total windmill industry inthis country ran at a loss of 40 million Danish crowns where the turnoverwas 550 million crowns. Danish firms are too small and seem to lack professionalmanagement. Production costs are too high and there is an urgent needfor structural rationalization. Danish windmills cannot at the presenttime compete with the foreign market, largely because of lack of marketingknow-how and financial backing. Yet today, many countries energy policiesinclude the development of renewable energy resources, especially inthe case of wind power. This should mean that the world market for windmillswill increase, but so will the number of foreign competitors. The authorssuggest the merging of Danish windmill manufacturing firms, and thesemergers should include corporations that produce electricity. Possibilitiesfor raising financial backing for running costs and export activitiesare mentioned, and ideas for rationalizing and reconstructing the wholeDanish windmill industry are described in detail.
