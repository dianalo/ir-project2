The New York Fed's order -- an unusual slap at a major bank -- forced Bankers Trust to restate the $338 million in foreign exchange trading income that stunned traders and bankers when it was reported last winter. Bankers Trust officials didn't dispute that the bank had improperly valued its currency options positions as of Dec. 31.    The restatement could seriously damage Bankers Trust's credibility among securities analysts and investors, because the nation's eighth-largest banking concern categorically denied through the winter and spring that it would be restating fourth-quarter earnings. And the restatement could fuel criticism that Bankers Trust has been too aggressive in foreign exchange trading, which supplied the bulk of its 1987 earnings.    Charles Sanford, chairman and chief executive officer of Bankers Trust, in a brief interview last night dismissed any concerns about the company's risk controls, saying: &quot;What's the big deal? There's nothing sinister here. There's no effect on earnings. The company is worth the same amount. It's just an accounting thing.&quot;    Earlier this year, it was rumored that internal and external auditors were combing the trading records of Andrew J. Krieger, Bankers Trust's former trading whiz who was responsible for $300 million in pretax trading gains last year.    Yesterday, Bankers Trust acknowledged that it had conducted an audit of its foreign exchange options trading accounts, although it wouldn't say if Mr. Krieger's accounts were involved.    Asked if the restatement stemmed from Mr. Krieger's activity, a Bankers Trust spokesman said, &quot;Andrew Krieger was a foreign exchange options trader during this period, and this involves foreign exchange options.&quot;    Mr. Krieger, who reportedly was unhappy with his $3 million bonus last year, resigned Feb. 23 from the bank and joined Soros Fund Management in April. Eight weeks later, the 32-year-old trader left Soros to form his own firm, Krieger andamp; Associates Ltd., after Soros became concerned about Mr. Krieger's huge bets on short-term currency moves.    Mr. Krieger's housekeeper said yesterday that he was traveling in India and couldn't be reached for several days.    Separately yesterday, Bankers Trust reported second-quarter net income of $174.1 million, or $2.18 a share, compared with a year-earlier loss of $554 million caused by special provisions for troubled foreign debt. First-half net totaled $300.1 million, or $3.79 a share, compared with a year-earlier loss of $429.7 million.    James J. McDermott, research director of Keefe, Bruyette andamp; Woods Inc., said following a Bankers Trust meeting for analysts last night that &quot;there's no question that the restatement challenges their credibility as a commercial bank/investment bank that aggressively works the innovative product edge. They say that this is not a risk-control issue but a valuation and accounting issue, but there's no way that you can separate the two.&quot;    Mr. McDermott said Bankers Trust allowed its options traders to make their own assumptions on volatility as well as future pricing. &quot;It was a loosey-goosey process of valuation,&quot; Mr. McDermott said. &quot;Basically what you have is a hole in the valuation process that you could drive a truck through. . . .{Bankers Trust} is going to pay for this. The mood among analysts at the meeting was not good.&quot;    A Fed official said yesterday that the Fed's examination of Bankers Trust's foreign exchange operation was a complex endeavor begun &quot;several months&quot; ago. &quot;From our point of view, it was like peeling a banana or taking the leaves off an artichoke,&quot; the official said. &quot;I have been struck by the similarity of the original rumors and what we now know happened,&quot; the Fed official said.    Foreign exchange options give the holder the right to buy or sell a currency at a set price for a specific period of time. The Bankers Trust spokesman said the options in question had been valued in accord with established policy. However, he added, &quot;The over-the-counter foreign exchange options market is relatively new, fast-growing and illiquid. The values are established in negotiated transactions. It's a subjective process.&quot;    In a statement, Bankers Trust said it and its auditor, Arthur Young andamp; Co., &quot;remain of the opinion that these adjustments are not material for financial reporting purposes under generally accepted accounting principles.&quot; A spokesman for the New York Fed said it wouldn't comment on the matter.    Bankers Trust said the restatement won't alter its reported earnings for the fourth quarter or for all of 1987. The company last year had net income of $1.1 million, or two cents a share. To prevent such a restatement, the bank reduced its account to pay employees' future bonuses by $80 million, offsetting the drop in foreign exchange trading income. Last year's results were depressed by a $636 million after-tax addition to loan-loss reserves for loans to Latin American countries.    In 1987, Bankers Trust earned $637 million before the addition to loan-loss reserves for Latin loans. Its total pretax foreign exchange trading income for the year was $513 million.    In this year's first quarter, Bankers Trust had a loss of $19.4 million in foreign exchange trading, but during the second quarter it had $73.7 million in foreign exchange gains.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Bankers Trust closed at $36.75, up $1.    ---   Charles W. Stevens contributed to this article. </TEXT></DOC>
