Republicanpresidential candidate Jack Kemp has declared his basic opposition. Otherpotential Republican candidates-Senator Robert Dole, former Secretaryof State Alexander Haig, and evangelist Pat Robertson-have expressedreservations. Former President Nixon and former Secretary of State Kissingerhave criticized the agreement, as has retiring NATO commander GeneralBernard Rogers. Congressional Democrats, faced by the prospect that aUS-Soviet INF agreement will give important aid to the Republicans inthe forthcoming presidential race, have pointed to defects in the understandingnow under negotiation. These criticisms will be reflected in the ratificationproceedings in the US Senate, which may be fairly dramatic for this firstUS-Soviet arms control agreement in nearly a decade. The author examinesthese concerns in detail.</TEXT></DOC>
