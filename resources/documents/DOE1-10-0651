According to various calculations, the rangeof individual doses from such releases varies between 7.2 and 163X {mu}Svper year for HTO and 1.8 x 10{sup -4} and 3.4 {mu}Sv per year for HTat 1 km from the power station. The conclusion is that the evaporationprocess, the oxidation of HT to HTO in the environment and a relevantdry deposition calculation method should be included in future modelsfor dose prediction.</TEXT></DOC>
