FFIRREA requires that within 120 days of its enactment, the NCUABoard prescribe, by regulation, audit requirements for the outside, theindependent audit of any federally insured credit union by a certifiedpublic accountant under certain conditions.<ITAG tagnum="84">Current Audit Requirements</ITAG>Section 115 of the Federal Credit Union Act (12 U.S.C. 1761(d)) requiresthat the supervisory committee of a federal credit union make or causeto be made an annual audit. Section 701.12(a) of the NCUA Rules and Regulations(12 CFR 701.12(a)) discusses the supervisory committee's responsibilitiesand the audit and verification activities generally used to carry out theseresponsibilities. Section 701.12(b) references generally accepted auditingstandards and discusses the minimum audit tests needed and the audit reportingrequirements. Section 701.12(c) discusses the preparation, maintenanceand availability requirements for workpapers in support of the annual audit.Section 701.12(d) requires that credit union compensated auditors be independentas defined therein. And andSection;701.12(e) provides instructions for theverification of members' accounts, which must be accomplished at leastonce every 2 years.It is NCUA's understanding that most, if not all, states have comparableannual audit requirements for federally insured state chartered creditunions. In any event, FFIRREA clearly imposes a requirement that everyfederally insured credit union annually obtain either a complete and satisfactorysupervisory committee audit or an independent audit by a certified publicaccountant. Additionally, andSection;741.2 of the NCUA Rules and Regulationsrequires any federally insured credit union to make or cause to be madea verification of member's accounts not less frequently than once every2 years consistent with andSection;701.12(e).<ITAG tagnum="84">Proposed Additional requirement</ITAG>This proposed rule would add andSection;701.13 for federal credit unionswhich provides that, under certain specified conditions (discussed below),the Administration will require an outside, independent audit or verification,as applicable, to be conducted by a certified public accountant. Additionally,the proposed rule would amend andSection;741.2 to require federally insuredcredit unions to meet the audit requirements of andSection;701.12 and 701.13.As required by section 919 of FFIRREA, andSection;701.13 defines the threespecified conditions under which an outside, independent audit by a certifiedpublic accountant shall be required:(1) The supervisory committee of the credit union has not conducted anannual supervisory committee audit; or(2) The annual supervisory committee audit conducted was not complete andsatisfactory; or(3) The credit union has experienced serious and persistent recordkeepingdeficiences.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">The proposed regulation is discussed in greater detail below in lightof each of these three conditions.<ITAG tagnum="84">No Audit Conducted</ITAG>If a credit union fails to obtain an annual audit or does not verify members'accounts at least once every 2 years, the proposed rule would require anoutside, independent audit by a certified public accountant, such auditor verification to fully comply with the existing rules in andSection; 701.12.<ITAG tagnum="84">Audit Incomplete or Unsatisfactory</ITAG>Any supervisory committee audit which does not satisfactorily and completelyaddress the andSection; 701.12(a) general guidelines, does not encompassthe andSection; 701.12(b) minimum testing requirements, is not properly supportedby adequate and complete workpaper evidence in accordance with andSection;701.12(c), or was conducted by a compensated auditor who was not independentas defined in andSection; 701.12(d), will be considered to fall within thescope of this proposed rule, i.e., the credit union will be required toobtain an outside, independent audit by a certified public accountant,such audit to fully comply with andSection; 701.12.Additionally, verifications which do not fully meet the requirements ofandSection; 701.12(e) and amended 741.2(b) will fall within the scope ofthis proposed rule and the credit union will be required to obtain an outside,independent verification by a certified public accountant.<ITAG tagnum="84">Serious and Persistent Recordkeeping Deficiencies</ITAG>The proposed rule will require a more comprehensive audit (greater auditscope than andSection; 701.12 minimum tests) for credit unions having seriousand persistent recordkeeping deficiencies as defined herein. Credit unionswith serious and persistent recordkeeping problems will be required bythe Administration to obtain an outside, independent audit by a certifiedpublic accountant in accordance with generally accepted auditing standardswhich results in an opinion, i.e., the audit must provide a reasonablebasis for expressing an opinion regarding the financial statements takenas a whole. The Administration believes this higher level of review isnecessary for safety and soundness reasons when a credit union has seriousrecordkeeping problems which continue to exist past a usual, expected,or normal period of time. Persistent recordkeeping deficiencies will beconsidered serious if the Administration has a reasonable doubt that thefinancial condition of the credit union is accurately and fairly presentedin the credit union's statements and that management practices and proceduresare sufficient to safeguard members' assets.Audit work performed by other than a certified public accounting firm willbe accepted provided that a certified public accountant certifies the financialstatements and attests to the opinion, therefore bearing full responsibilityand accountability to the Administration for the opinion expressed thereon.<ITAG tagnum="84">Executive Order 12612</ITAG>Congress has mandated in section 919 of FFIRREA that NCUA prescribe regulationsrequiring that all federally insured state chartered credit unions obtainan outside, independent audit by a certified public accountant if the creditunion has not obtained an annual supervisory committee audit, the supervisorycommittee audit is not complete and satisfactory or the credit union hasexperienced serious and persistent recordkeeping deficiencies as definedby the NCUA Board.To implement the FFIRREA provisions, it is incumbent upon NCUA to definewhat constitutes a ``complete and satisfactory supervisory committee audit''and ``serious and persistent recordkeeping deficiencies''. To accomplishthis, NCUA has proposed to apply to federally insured state credit unionsthe same standards that exist in andSection; 701.12 and proposed andSection;701.13 for federal credit unions.It is the NCUA Board's belief that this is the most fair and administrativelyfeasible method of accomplishing the requirements of FFIRREA, and that,inasmuch as state-chartered credit unions are already subject to comparableaudit requirements under state law, significant new burdens will not beimposed beyond those legislatively mandated by FFIRREA. Comments are requestedon this approach.<ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Procedures</ITAG>Regulatory Flexibility ActThe NCUA Board certifies that the proposed rule, if made final, shouldnot have a significant impact on a substantial number of small credit unions.The proposed rule will only affect small credit unions to the extent theydo not adhere to existing regulations. Accordingly, the NCUA Board hasdetermined that a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis is not required.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects</ITAG>12 CFR 701Credit unions, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements, Supervisory committeeaudits.12 CFR 741Credit unions; Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.By the National Credit Union Administration Board on September 14, 1989.<ITAG tagnum="6">Becky Baker,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Secretary of the Board.</ITAG>Accordingly, NCUA proposes to amend its regulations as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 701_[AMENDED]</ITAG>1.
