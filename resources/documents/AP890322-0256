(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Leaders of Colombia's Medellin Cartelwere indicted Wednesday on charges of cocaine trafficking andmasterminding the slayings of the Colombian justice minister and aU.S. drug informant.   The sweeping indictment alleges that both Nicaragua and theBahamas were used as way stations for $1 billion in drug imports tothe United States. Among those charged is a close associate ofBahamian Prime Minister Lynden Pindling.   The case ``once again shows that the United States is not goingto let up our efforts to catch these individuals who are supplyingdrugs to the United States,'' U.S. Attorney Robert W. Genzman said.``We feel that the pressure has got to be kept on regardless of howmany indictments come out in the United States against members ofthe cartel.''   In all, 30 people were charged in the ``second wave'' ofindictments resulting from last May's conviction of Carlos LehderRivas, one of the leaders of the cartel, which officials say isresponsible for up to 80 percent of the cocaine imported into theUnited States.   The indictment accuses cartel leader Pablo Escobar Gaviria oforganizing the assassination of Colombian Justice Minister RodrigoLara Bonilla on April 29, 1984, and says Escobar and Fabio OchoaVasquez directed the Feb. 19, 1986, slaying of former DrugEnforcement Administration informant Barry Seal.   Other major figures indicted included cartel kingpins JoseGonzalo Rodriguez Gacha, Ochoa's brother Jorge Ochoa Vasquez, andGonzalo Mejia.   None of the cartel members has been taken into custody, althoughmost have already been indicted in Miami. They are believed to be inColombia, officials said.   Genzman noted that it took the government six years to get Lehderto the United States. ``I am confident that in some point in time wewill be able to obtain custody of the others,'' he said.   Also indicted was Jack Carlton Reed, who was Lehder'sco-defendant at last year's trial.   Lehder and Reed were convicted here last May 19 of conspiring toimport cocaine. Lehder _ an unindicted co-conspirator in the newindictment _ is serving a life sentence and Reed is serving a15-year term.   Genzman said the indictment covers a 15-year period from 1974 tothe present, and involves the importation of 44,000 pounds ofcocaine worth $1 billion.   ``The indictment contains 205 snapshots of a long-term drugconspiracy in action,'' Genzman said.   ``The indictment traces Lehder's development into a primaryoverseas transporter of cocaine for other Medellin Cartel members,and his continued assocation with these members after they developedtheir own tranportation operations,'' Genzman said.   The indictment accuses Escobar, Rodriguez, Mejia, Reed and thetwo Ochoas of running a continuing criminal enterprise _ punishableby a maximum life sentence _ and conspiracy to import drugs.   The indictment alleges that after the slaying of Bonilla inColombia the top cartel leaders fled Colombia, and eventuallytraveled to Nicaragua. Lehder and others paid Nicaraguan officialsto allow them to stay in that country and use it as a base tosmuggle cocaine to the United States, the indictment says.   They allegedly stored 1,400 kilograms of cocaine at Los BrasilesAir Force Base in Nicaragua before flying it into the United States.   The Bahamian charged in the indictment, Everette Bannister ofNassau, is charged with receiving bribes to allow the cartel to usethe islands just off Florida's shores as a way station for drugshipments.   NBC News, citing unidentified federal law enforcement officials,reported that an early draft of the indictment said Bannister sharedthe alleged payoffs with Pindling and other Bahamian officials.Pindling's name was dropped from the indictment after it wasreviewed by the Justice and State Departments in Washington, NBCsaid. The network did not say whether the early draft named Pindlingas a defendant.   Bannister's telephone in Nassau was busy Wednesday and he couldnot be reached for comment. Bill Kalis, a spokesman for Pindling'soffice, said the government of the Bahamas would have no comment onthe indictment.   Genzman said the United States has an extradition treaty with theBahamas, and would seek custody of Bannister. He refused to answerquestions about continuing allegations that Pindling himself wasinvolved in the drug operation.   Gorman Bannister, Everette Bannister's son, is a protectedfederal witness who testified in Lehder's 1988 trial.   In the trial, Bannister characterized his father, chairman ofBahamas World Airlines and a consultant to Resorts International, asan influence peddler who took protection payoffs from drug smugglersand regularly supplied Pindling with money.   In 1987, the younger Bannister, wearing a hood, testified beforea U.S. Senate subcommittee about drug-related corruption in theBahamas.   Bannister testified in Lehder's trial that his father took moneyfrom Lehder and former Jacksonville marijuana and cocaine smugglerEdward Hayes Ward to help protect them from law enforcement efforts.   ``My father said he made a deal with Carlos to get $100,000 amonth to make Norman's Cay operational,'' Bannister testified inFebruary 1988, referring to Lehder's island transshipment point inthe Bahamas, about 40 miles southeast of Nassau.   Several witnesses in the Lehder trial testified that they hadmade payoffs to high Bahamian officials, including Pindling, who hasdenied the allegations.   In 1984, the Royal Bahamian Commission cleared Pindling of anywrongdoing concerning allegations that he took payoffs from drugsmugglers. Pindling, first elected in 1967, was re-elected in 1987.   Aside from Reed, who was already in prison, only five of thoseindicted Wednesday were immediately arrested, authorities said. Theywere identified as Yemel Nacel of New York City, who is Lehder'sformer wife; Barry Kane, a Hyannis, Mass., attorney; Jeffrey EdwardLewis of Fort Lauderdale, Fla.; Diane Helen Thornhill of SouthernCalifornia; and Donald Gary Podesto of San Rafael, Calif.</TEXT></DOC>
