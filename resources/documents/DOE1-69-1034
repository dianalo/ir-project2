<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-69-1034 </DOCNO><TEXT>A serious disadvantage of most confocal optical scanning microscopes isthat they use mechanical scanning methods, which lead to long frame times.Here we describe an off-axis CLSM in which scanning of the laser focalpoint is achieved with the aid of a fast acousto-optical deflector forline scanning, and a scanning mirror for frame scanning. This arrangementaffords short frame-times of 0.05 seconds, and 0.02 seconds is withineasy reach. A more or less three-dimensional image of the object canbe built up at high speed by combining a number of confocal image sections.The system is suitable for reflection as well as fluorescence microscopy.</TEXT></DOC>
