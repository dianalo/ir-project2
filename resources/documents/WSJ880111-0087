It looks as if we may finally be getting some from the French finance minister, Edouard Balladur, who went on French television last week to declare that the root cause of all these disorders of the world economy is a monetary crisis. He proposed what ministers in many countries have only danced around -- movement toward a global fixed-rate system, possibly linked to gold.    Most of Mr. Balladur's peers, of course, have been blaming the world economy's problems on a variety of symptoms -- the U.S. budget deficit, for example, or the trade deficit, or the weather, or Japan's failure to import more goods. It was Mr. Balladur -- a mild-mannered man known in Washington as Eddie Hardball, that being the rough translation of his last name -- who disclosed early in the week that a secret accord exists among the G-7 nations to keep exchange rates somewhat under control. On television Wednesday, he declared bluntly that the agreement does not go far enough and called for a system that is automatic and contains sanctions.    For our part, we suspect monetary causes not only behind the general instability, but even behind Friday's 140-point drop in New York stocks, blamed variously on program trading and a snowstorm. Stocks around the world rallied earlier in the week on central bank interventions to firm the dollar. On Thursday the Bundesbank announced it was tightening domestic policy to offset the interventions, so presumably the Fed was sterilizing as well -- a bearish sign for the dollar and hence stocks.    &quot;I believe that we are living in the end of a period of floating exchange rates, and I think it is time to return to a system, I repeat, as automatic and as constraining as possible. This is what I want the ministers of finance of the large industrialized countries to discuss among themselves,&quot; Mr. Balladur said on television Wednesday. Until now agitation for a return to a proper fixed rate system was the agenda of mainly a small band of economists, most notable among them the Canadian Robert Mundell of Columbia University.    While suggesting discussions among all the industrialized nations, Mr. Balladur specifically called for an examination of the possibility of the creation of a European central bank that would manage &quot;a common currency,&quot; possibly the ECU. He expressed the hope that the European monetary system not reduce itself -- as is currently the case -- to a Franco-German dialog but that it extend to the group of important European currencies, and according to more just rules. Obviously he had much more on his mind than merely Europe.    Jean Boissonnat, director of the French magazine L'Expansion, asked Mr. Balladur whether he wants the dollar to be linked to gold again. &quot;I don't know if it is possible,&quot; Mr. Balladur replied, &quot;but an instrument of reference must be found which wouldn't be one of the currencies.&quot;    &quot;Then what else but gold?&quot; Mr. Boissonnat asked.    &quot;One can think about it,&quot; Mr. Balladur responded, &quot;This is precisely a way, an important subject of reflection.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
