(MTI) Wednesday announced that LiTel Communications'Customer Service Division will use its Lightning Library optical product toenhance the company's customer service for its entire 1,210-mile fiber opticnetwork via optical read/write disk technology.andM;LiTel's network, which consists of two VAX 9000s on the same cluster, is theMidwestern link in the nation's coast-to-coast all digital fiber optictelecommunications service.andP;  LiTel's service area incorporates Illinois,Indiana, Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania.andM;&quot;LiTel has always been a 100 percent DEC shop,&quot; said Bernie Lewis, LiTel'sdirector, Corporate Data Center.andP;  &quot;Because LiTel had never purchasedequipment from a third-party vendor, we spent a sufficient amount of timeevaluating various products in the marketplace,&quot; Lewis continued.andM;&quot;We chose Micro Technology because Lightning Library could solve our currentproblem, and we saw another product fit for our future requirements.andP;  Overthe long haul, MTI had the most to offer.&quot;andM;LiTel is an extremely customer service-oriented company, and their CustomerService Department wanted more than three consecutive months of customerbilling on-line.andP;  Customers frequently needed service on billings that weremore than three months old.andP;  Older billing information was secured onmicrofiche so service was delayed while microfiche was searched.andM;LiTel purchased the Lightning Library optical subsystem from Micro Technologyin January 1991, and will be able to retain six months of archived recordson-line -- doubling the capacity of information at hand, while saving 40percent of costly on-line disk space.andP;  Ultimately, this enhanced solution isless expensive for LiTel to operate because the company will be able to deferthe cost of the more expensive on-line disk storage arrays.andM;&quot;When MTI introduced its optical jukebox, we saw a way to enhance ourcustomer service through better response time, and save our company money atthe same time,&quot; Lewis said.andM;Costs are also cut by more than 15 percent with the elimination of the needto supply all LiTel remote offices with copies of the microfiche.andM;Micro Technology's Lightning Library allows up to 18GB of data to be storedon the &quot;sideline&quot; rather than in archival storage.andP;  LiTel's system utilizesthree of the jukeboxes for its customer service application.andM;LiTel, which was founded in 1983 and has headquarters in Columbus, Ohio, is along-distance carrier satisfying the voice, data and video communicationsneeds of large and small businesses.andP;  LiTel is No.andP;  21 on Inc.
