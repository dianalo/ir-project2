But many have given hardly any thoughtto the short-term funds that lie between the two extremes.   Those often-overlooked investments may be a timely choicefor a portion of the vast sums now parked in money funds,some financial advisers say.</LP><TEXT>   Yield is one reason. Short-term bond funds, which investin securities with maturities of one to five years, currentlyoffer yields that are around half a percentage point higherthan those of money funds.   But a bigger reason to consider shifting some money-funddollars into short-term funds is that they return a lot morethan money funds when interest rates fall. And despite thisweek's rise in rates, many financial advisers say the thelonger-term outlook is still for lower rates.   &quot;The risk in being in money funds at this point is thatyou could see your income drop by 15% to 25%&quot; over the nextyear, says Hugh R. Lamle, executive vice president of moneymanager M.D. Sass Investors Services Inc. in New York.&quot;People who are dependent on that income are taking a riskthat they may not be aware of.&quot;   The monthly income delivered by short-term funds doesn'tdecline as rapidly as money-fund payouts when interest ratesfall, because of the longer maturities of the investments intheir portfolios. Investors who sell their shares after arate drop are also likely to reap a profit.   Still, the short-term bond funds involve risks not foundin money funds. Investors who don't understand thedifferences could be in for &quot;an unpleasant surprise,&quot; saysTimothy C. Medley, a Jackson, Miss., money manager.   While money funds are designed to maintain a fixed,$1-a-share price, the share prices of bond funds fluctuate,rising when interest rates fall, and falling when interestrates rise. Although the prices of short-term funds vary muchless than the prices of long-maturity funds, the swings canbe painful. As a result, short-term bond funds underperformmoney funds in some periods of rising rates.   Indeed, that's exactly what happened in the first quarterof this year, figures compiled by Lipper Analytical ServicesInc. show. The average short-term bond fund returned only0.94% -- half the 1.89% delivered by the average money-marketfund. (Over the same quarter, long-term bond funds had lossesof 1.36%.)   The short-term bond funds also lagged money funds over thepast three years. But they were winners over the past oneyear and over five years.   A number of financial advisers and money managers havestepped up their use of short-term bond investments becausethey expect rates to fall. For instance, Bailard, Biehl andamp;Kaiser, a San Mateo, Calif., investment adviser, is usingfunds with three-year to five-year maturities for about athird of the client dollars earmarked for &quot;cash equivalents.&quot;   Individual investors who don't have a strong convictionabout rate trends might want to consider short-term bondfunds for some of the dollars they expect to keep in moneyfunds for at least several years. With a long time horizon,it's more likely investors will be rewarded with higherreturns for taking the added price risk of the short-termbond funds.   Extending maturities can be even more remunerative withtax-exempt municipal securities, says Ian MacKinnon, a seniorvice president at Vanguard Group of Investment Cos., ValleyForge, Pa. That's because tax-exempt rates usually rise moresteeply than taxable rates as investors extend maturities.   Over the past year, the Lipper numbers show, short-termtaxable funds outperformed taxable money funds by just overthree-quarters of a percentage point -- 9.37% vs. 8.58%. Butwith tax-exempt investments, the short-term bond funds'advantage was more than one and a half percentage points -- atotal return of 7.47% vs. 5.82% for tax-exempt money funds.   Like money funds, short-term bond funds generally allowinvestors to get at their money just by writing a check. Butinvestors who plan to write a lot of checks should stay awayfrom short-term bond funds. Because bond-fund share pricesfluctuates, each check written is likely to produce a taxablegain or loss. &quot;It can be a record-keeping nightmare,&quot; Mr.MacKinnon says.   Some financial advisers decry the use of short-term bondfunds as a money-fund substitute. &quot;Short-term bond funds andmoney-market funds are two completely different animals,&quot; onean investment and the other a savings vehicle, says John T.Blankinship Jr., a Del Mar, Calif., financial planner.   Mr. Blankinship currently likes the short-term funds asinvestments, however. &quot;With a decrease in interest rates, youshould easily get a double-digit return&quot; over the next year,he says.   Similarly Mr. Medley, the Jackson, Miss., money manager,says he regularly uses bond funds with average maturities inthe 1.5-to-6 year range for the bond portion of hisportfolios. Over the past several decades, he notes,five-year bonds have performed about the same as longersecurities -- and with less variability.   &quot;Once in a lifetime you'll have a bond market rally like1982,&quot; when long-term Treasury bonds produced a 40% totalreturn, Mr. Medley says. &quot;But generally, we've foundlong-term bonds are just not worth the risk.&quot;   ---              How Fixed-Income Funds Compare                                                                                                             Total returns for periods ended March 31, 1990                                                                                                                                            COMPOUND ANNUAL RETURNS FUND CATEGORY   THREE MONTHS  ONE YEAR  3 YEARS   5 YEARS                                                                                                        Money Market        1.89%      8.58%    7.54%     7.20% Short-Term Bonds    0.94%      9.37%    6.98%     8.65% Long A-Rated Bonds -1.36%      9.98%    5.77%    10.56%                                                                                                         Source: Lipper Analytical Services Inc.</TEXT></DOC>
