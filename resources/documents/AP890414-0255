The boost in the Labor Department's Producer Price Indexreflected higher costs for both food and energy, although theincreases in both categories were smaller than those registered inthe first two months of the year.   The overall gain was close to analysts' expectations and helpedcalm Wall Street's inflation fears, causing a sharp rally in earlytrading today.   The stock market staged a sharp rally, encouraged by theapparent easing of inflationary pressures. The Dow Jones average of30 industrials climbed 21.45 to 2,317.45 in the first half hour oftrading.   While March's increase was much more restrained than the strongjumps of the previous two months, wholesale prices one stop shortof retail have risen at a compound annual rate of 10.2 percent overthe past three months.   That is the largest quarterly increase since prices rose at acompound annual rate of 13.2 percent during the first three monthsof 1981.   Should the first quarter's rate be sustained for the rest of theyear, it would far exceed the increase registered for 1988, whenwholesale prices rose 4 percent in what was the steepest gain inseven years. Prices had risen 2.2 percent in 1987.   Financial markets had been fearful that further bad news on theinflation front would prompt the Federal Reserve Board to step upits campaign to slow economic growth and restrain inflationarypressures by pushing up interest rates.   Dirk Van Dongen, president of the National Association ofWholesaler-Distributors, said the latest report was good news butdoesn't totally put to rest worries about accelerating inflation.   ``I don't think at all that this suggests that the inflationwatch should be terminated,'' he said. ``I don't think this battleis over.''   Wholesale food prices rose 0.8 percent last month after jumping1.2 percent during February. Last month's increase in food costswas led by a 38.8 percent gain in prices for eggs while vegetablecosts dropped 11.6 percent after surging 35.3 percent duringFebruary.   Energy prices, meanwhile, rose 0.9 percent in March following a2.4 percent increase during the previous month. Last month'sincrease was led by a 16.8 percent rise in home heating oil prices,while gasoline costs rose 3.5 percent and natural gas pricesdeclined 5.4 percent.   Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, prices rose0.3 percent in March, down from a 0.6 percent increase a monthearlier.   The overall March increase left the Producer Price Index forfinished goods at 112.2, meaning that a hypothetical selection ofgoods costing $100 in 1982 would have cost $112.20 last month.   That was up 50 cents from February and 5.6 percent above March1988.   The troubling inflation reports at the start of 1989 had comeeven as signs emerge that the economy is cooling off in response tothe Fed's anti-inflation campaign.   Three other government reports released today added to growingevidence that the economy is slowing down:   _The U.S. merchandise trade deficit swelled by 20.9 percent to$10.5 billion in February as Americans increased their appetite forforeign goods, the Commerce Department reported.   _The operating rate for U.S. factories declined for the secondconsecutive month in March to 84 percent, the first back-to-backdeclines in nearly three years, the Federal Reserve Board said.   _Business inventories rose 0.5 percent in February while salesplunged 0.9 percent, the steepest decline in more than two years,Commerce reported.   Allen Sinai, chief economist for the Boston Co., said in advanceof today's reports that while the economy does seem to be losingsteam, it may take awhile for that to translate into inflationrelief.   ``There is a tendency to expect inflation to weaken as soon asthe economy starts to slow, but more often than not it doesn'thappen that way,'' Sinai said. ``More often than not, it takes aweak economy for quite some time before inflation begins to peakand then drop.''   Despite the moderate price hikes last month for finished goodssuch as bread and clothing, the index for prices at earlier stagesof production demonstrated stronger inflation.   Prices at the intermediate level for items such as flour andcloth rose 0.7 percent, while the cost of crude goods such ascotton and wheat was up 2.3 percent.   March's figures on increases in consumer prices, which so farthis year have been smaller than those at the wholesale level, willbe released on Tuesday. The Consumer Price Index rose 0.4 percentin February and 0.6 percent in January.   Sinai and many others are forecasting a mild recession by thefirst half of 1990, but other analysts still are hopeful that theFed can slow the economy just enough to restrain inflation andproduce a ``soft landing'' in which growth slows but the economyavoids an outright downturn.</TEXT></DOC>
