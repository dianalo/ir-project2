DNA recombinant technology, indeed, offers exciting prospectsfor modern medicine. The use of plasma derivatives, obtained by constructingappropriate producing strains, could dramatically modify the clinicaloutcome for patients suffering from hereditary and/or acquired deficienciesin plasma proteins. These substances are currently purified, partiallyor totally, from pooled human plasma. Replacement therapy, using theseenriched fractions, is complicated by the lack of specific pathogen-freematerials. It appears thus worthwhile to develop new sources of plasmaproteins which would be devoid of these complications. In this respect,genetic engineering techniques allow the construction of microbial strainscarrying the genetic information for plasma proteins and engineered toproduce large amounts of the appropriate substance. Although it is nowtechnically possible to obtain some plasma proteins through DNA recombinanttechnology, it is obvious that extensive studies in these products mustbe performed in order to demonstrate that they are structurally and functionallysimilar to the protein contained in normal plasma. Before such proteinswill be used for transfusion purposes, they have to be available in reasonablequantities with the same biological activity as the natural species,in a non-immunogenic, highly purified, sterile, non-toxic and non-pyrogenicform. Assuming that all these technical problems will be solved, it isalso important that the new products become economically competitivewith the classical source. Their economic future also depends on howeasily these products will reach health care systems in countries unableto fulfill their needs with the current blood transfusion system.</TEXT></DOC>
