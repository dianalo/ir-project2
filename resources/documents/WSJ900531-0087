It may be true that you do not see children begging inHavana or &quot;misery belts&quot; surrounding the city. Other thingsthat you do not see in Havana are freedom and prosperity. Youdo not see the small business. Or the corner newsstand wherepeople drink a cup of coffee and enjoy a politicaldiscussion. Or the middle-class neighborhoods where familieslive and enjoy watching their uncensored TV programs.</LP><TEXT>   By Mr. de Cordoba's standard, most cities in the worldwouldn't compare favorably with Havana. Yet we do not seeHaitians rowing their rafts to Cuba. But we do see Cubansrowing to Miami.   One thing you do see in Havana, and not in other LatinAmerican capitals, are hotels and restaurants for theexclusive use of tourists. There is no other country thatexcludes its citizens, and its currency, from tourists'resorts. Newlyweds cannot spend their honeymoon in the betterCuban resorts. A Cuban cannot take his family out to dinnerat one of these exclusive restaurants. This is the way lifeis in the &quot;socialist paradise&quot; of Cuba.   Something puzzles me. Journalists who visit Cuba alwaysspeak of the free health care enjoyed by Cubans. On the otherhand, our relatives in Cuba are always requesting medicine intheir letters. The answer is that Fidel Castro has beenbetter at building hospitals than providing medicine.Furthermore, he has done all of this by turning Cuba into oneof the world's indebted nations. His legacy will be politicalprisons and a massive foreign debt.   When Mr. Castro moves from the political scene, and Cuba'sdoors are finally opened to the world, we will learn thetruth of Cuba. As with Romania and the other East Europeancountries, we will learn about the corruption, the faultyhealth care, the ecology crisis and the people's discontent.   Communism has been far better at impressing U.S.journalists and academicians than at gaining the acceptanceof local citizens. We saw this in Eastern Europe. And we willsoon see what Cubans have known for 30 years: The veneratedMr. Castro and his socialist paradise have been a big fraud.   Silvio Canto Jr.   Carrollton, Texas</TEXT></DOC>
