Magnetic reflection of particles isan essential role in the shock structure. Instability of the reflectedparticles in the shock front produces intense extraordinary mode radiation.Such shocks are candidates for the particle accelerator in plerions andin extragalactic jets only if the upstream Poynting flux composes nomore than 10% of the total. I summarize analytical and numerical studiesof radiation dominated accretion onto the magnetic poles of neutron stars.The upper limit to the photon luminosity depends upon magnetic confinement,not upon the dragging of photons into the star. Numerical solutions showthe plasma forms large scale ``photon bubbles.'' I suggest the percolativeloss of radiation controls the pressure and therefore the limits of magneticconfinement. Loss of magnetic confinement through resistive interchangeinstability is suggested as a means of generating TeV to PeV voltagedrops along the magnetic field. 34 refs., 6 figs., 1 tab.</TEXT></DOC>
