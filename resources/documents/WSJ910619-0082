A growing coalition of lawmakers fret that FCC ChairmanAlfred Sikes will push through more deregulation of ATandamp;T,clipping the wings of fledgling competitors and ultimatelyboosting prices for consumers. They want the agency to take acareful approach not only to ATandamp;T but also to changing anobscure policy that helps ATandamp;T's competitors, especially at atime when ATandamp;T has begun regaining market share.</LP><TEXT>   In 1989, the FCC adopted price-cap regulation for ATandamp;T,giving it flexibility to change prices on 14 days' notice,down from 45 days, as long as prices for certain groups ofservices remained below a specified ceiling. The agency alsohas allowed ATandamp;T to offer big corporate customers customizedpackages of services. Now, the agency is getting ready tovote on streamlined regulation, letting ATandamp;T change prices oroffer new services on only one day's notice with nosupporting cost data. It is also considering new rules oncharges for connecting with local phone networks that couldraise costs for ATandamp;T's rivals.   To underscore their concern about all this, 14 members ofthe House telecommunications subcommittee, led by ChairmanEdward Markey of Massachusetts, wrote Mr. Sikes, urging himto proceed with caution. &quot;The FCC's decisions must be basedon marketplace realities rather than on theoretical models,&quot;the lawmakers warned. Failure to study the impact, theywrote, &quot;will reverse our two decades of efforts to fosterlong-distance competition for the benefit of consumers.&quot; Asimilar letter was signed by four other members of the panel,which will hold a hearing today to examine the FCC's agendaand the state of competition in the telephone industry.   Subcommittee member Jim Cooper, a Democrat from Tennessee,says the proposed changes might initially lead to pricebreaks from ATandamp;T, but those aren't likely to last ifcompetition is crippled. &quot;Consumers get the best deal whenthere is real, vigorous competition,&quot; Rep. Cooper says. &quot;Tome the competition is not yet sufficiently strong so that wecan sleep peacefully at night if we let the ATandamp;T gorilla outof its cage.&quot; Other committee members worry that the FCC isregulating piecemeal and doesn't see how several pendingissues are linked.   To allay those fears, the commission plans a major meetingin August. It plans to consider several related telephoneissues, including proposals first made last year tostreamline regulation of ATandamp;T and give the company moreflexibility to meet competition in the business market.   The agency, especially Chairman Sikes, has leaned stronglytoward continuing to ease regulation of the company,particularly in the business sector. Mr. Sikes's stand issupported by the White House.   In a letter yesterday to Rep. Markey, Mr. Sikes sought toassure lawmakers that the FCC isn't making hasty decisions.&quot;We are committed to fair and vigorous interexchangecompetition that benefits consumers of interexchangeservices,&quot; he wrote. Mr. Sikes emphasized that thecommission's proposals to reduce ATandamp;T's regulatoryrequirements won't affect residential and small businesscustomers, but rather they focus on business services.   The FCC has cited studies showing that seven years afterthe breakup of the Bell System, ATandamp;T's share of the marketfor business customers spending $1,000 or more a month onlong-distance service has fallen below 50%. Analysts figureATandamp;T still controls 70% to 75% of business among the biggesttelecommunications users: companies whose long-distance billsrun $1 million or more a year.   ATandamp;T's overall market share has dropped to an estimated65% to 70%, though since last year the company appears tohave stopped losing share and may have added a percentagepoint or so in the first quarter. MCI Communications Corp.'sshare is about 16%, and United Telecommunications' US Sprinthas about 9%. None of the remaining 200 or so small carriershave more than 1% of the market. But the small carriers, manyof which serve niche markets, play a big role in keeping alid on long-distance prices.   Only ATandamp;T is required to file public tariffs that aresupported by cost data, and to wait for a notice period toexpire before putting the new prices or services into effect.The company argues that the procedure gives competitors timeand information to delay or stop a new service.   The FCC is likely to decide at its August meeting to allowATandamp;T to continue offering customized packages of services tobig business customers. The packages -- known as Tariff 12and Tariff 15 arrangements -- permit ATandamp;T to negotiate withbig corporate customers special packages of longdistanceservices, including 800 service, WATS and private lines.   ATandamp;T has signed about 80 contracts for Tariff 12 packages,and uses Tariff 15 less frequently to match competitors'custom packages of services for specific customers. BecauseATandamp;T is required under law to make tariff offerings generallyavailable, an appeals court last year ruled that the FCCneeded to rethink its approval of one-of-a-kind Tariff 12packages. Several lawmakers and rivals say the FCC isignoring the court and the issue is only headed for morelitigation.   The commissioners are also likely to consider a changethat could help ATandamp;T's rivals: a proposal to permit businesscustomers to switch long-distance carriers and keep the same800 number.   In addition, the commission is under a Sept. 1 deadline todecide what to do with the obscure &quot;equal charge rule,&quot; whichrequires long-distance carriers to pay the same amount, perminute of telephone traffic, for connections to the localphone networks. If the FCC drops the policy in favor ofcharges based on actual costs, competitors could wind uppaying rates three or four times higher than ATandamp;T, whosegreater volume and other advantages give it lower costs. Thedisparity could put most of the small long-distance carriersout of business, lawmakers fear.   Some agency officials say the policy should be eliminated.The money involved is hefty: Estimates of ATandamp;T's potentialsaving run from $400 million to $2 billion.   ATandamp;T says the money would be returned to customers.Moreover, as the FCC approaches several decisions onlong-distance service, it should &quot;look at what's in thecustomer's best interest,&quot; says Joel Lubin, ATandamp;T's regulatoryvice president. &quot;The customers' needs should outweighcompetitors' complaints.&quot;   Members of the Competitive Telecommunications Association,a trade group representing small carriers, argue that itisn't time to lift the rules on ATandamp;T. &quot;This is a very fragileindustry from the standpoint of our ability to remain inbusiness unless deregulation is approached carefully,&quot; saysHoward Finkelstein, president of Metromedia CommunicationsCorp. Already, he says, ATandamp;T has lured away most ofMetromedia's big corporate long-distance customers withcontracts for custom-tailored service.   For many of the 200 or so smallest long-distance companiesthat share less than 10% of the market, &quot;a precipitousdecision on the equal charge rule and deregulation by the FCCcould be fatal,&quot; says Michael Oxley, an Ohio Democrat andmember of the House subcommittee. &quot;The real fear is that someof the babies will be smothered in the crib.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
