In remarks to the closing session of the Democratic NationalConvention, the Massachusetts governor pledged to ``forge a new eraof greatness for America.''   The nominee was introduced by his cousin, Academy Award winningactress Olympia Dukakis, who narrated a brief film with scenes fromhis life _ including his home in Brookline, Mass., and the25-year-old snowblower she wheeled out of the garage as an exampleof his tightfistedness.   He opened his speech by recalling the night of the Oscarceremonies when Ms. Dukakis raised her Oscar over her head andsaid, ``OK, Michael, let's go.''   The nominee's eyes filled with tears and he bowed his headbriefly when he referred to his late father ``the young man whoarrived at Ellis Island with only $25 in his pocket, but with adeep and abiding faith in the promise in America.''   The joyful Democrats who packed the hall cheered lustily when hetold them, ``We're going to win this race.'' Ninety-one times theyinterrupted him with cheers and applause.   At one point when Dukakis said he wanted a vice president ``whowon't sit silently by,'' the delegates began a chant, that hadbecome one of the themes of the convention: ``Where was George?'' _a reference to Vice President George Bush.   For many of the party faithful, it was the first opportunity forgenuine cheers since the Republican era was ushered in by RonaldReagan in 1980.   It was shortly after 11 o`clock when Dukakis finished speakingand his wife joined him on the podium. They embraced and then TexasSen. Lloyd Bentsen, the vice presidential nominee, and his wife,B.A., also stepped into the spotlight.   The podium quickly became a family scene with the children andparents of both nominees joining them.   Then in the traditional unity gesture, Jesse Jackson and hiswife, Jacqueline, also stepped to the podium. Following them werethe other Democrats who had lost out to Dukakis in the contest forthe nomination.   Before Dukakis was introduced, his father-in-law, Harry EllisDickson, associate conductor emeritus of the Boston Pops Orchestra,conducted ``Fanfare for Michael Dukakis,'' composed for theoccasion by John Williams.   For Dukakis, the speech marked the culmination of a 16-monthcampaign for his party's presidential nomination and the formalopening of his challenge to Bush.   After the convention ended, Dukakis, his family and Bentsen andhis wife walked across the street to the Georgia World CongressCenter where they received thunderous applause from thousands ofdelegates celebrating at a victory party.   In the five-minute impromptu remarks, he urged the delegates notto ease up their support for the ticket, warning, ``This is goingto be a tough, tight, competitive race.''   Dukakis and Bentsen, will leave the convention city together onFriday for joint campaign appearances in Texas, California, NorthDakota, Missouri and Pennsylvania.   The nominee paid tribute to Jackson as a man who has lifted somany hearts with the dignity and the hope of his message throughoutthis campaign; a man whose very candidacy says to every child _ aimhigh; to every citizen _ you count; to every voter _ you make adifference; to every American _ you are full shareholder in ourdream.''   Jackson gave Dukakis a thumbs-up sign when the nominee waved.   The speech echoed familiar themes and phrases from his campaign_ from the call for ``good jobs at good wages'' to the pledge towage ``a real war _ not a phony war _ against drugs.''   In a reference to the scandals of the Reagan administration,Dukakis said that ``if you accept the privilege of public service,you had better understand the responsibilities of public service.   ``If you violate that trust you'll be fired; if you violate thelaw you'll be prosecuted; and if you sell arms to the Ayatollah,don't expect a pardon from the president of the United States.''   Dukakis switched to Spanish, a language in which he is fluent,to pay tribute to the late Willie Velasquez, founder of theSouthwest Voter Education Project, which registered thousands ofHispanics to vote.   President Reagan came in for praise for his arms control efforts.   ``He has said that we should judge the Soviet Union not by whatit says but by what it does,'' Dukakis said of the Republicanpresident. ``And I agree with that.''   ``We must be _ and we are _ and we will be _ militarilystrong,'' he pledged, in an obvious response to those who criticizehis weak on defense.   ``We must always be prepared to defend our freedom,'' he said.``But we must always remember that our greatest strength comes notfrom what we possess, but from what we believe; not from what wehave, but from who we are.''   Watching her son accept the presidential nomination was EuterpeDukakis, the nominee's mother who came to the United States fromGreece 75 years ago. His late father also was a Greek immigrantand, if elected president, Dukakis would be the first son of twoimmigrant parents to hold the office since Andrew Jackson.   ``It's time to rekindle the American spirit of invention anddaring; to exchange voodoo economics for can-do economics; to buildthe best America by bringing out the very best in every American,''said Dukakis.   Earlier in the day, Dukakis tried out some self-deprecatinghumor during a brief appearance at a luncheon sponsored by theDemocratic National Committee and the party's House and Senatecampaign committees.   ``As all of you know, I'm a stem-winding orator,'' he said.   He told the assembled group that his wife, Kitty, had asked ifshe could look at his acceptance speech, which he had spent much ofthe week writing.   ``I said OK and she went into the bedroom,'' he said. ``When Iwent into the room myself to get my jacket, my wife was fast asleepon the bed and the speech was beside her, half read.''   In his convention speech, Dukakis said the Democrats would win``because we are the party that believes in the American dream.   ``A dream so powerful that no distance of ground, no expanse ofocean, no barrier of language, no distinction of race or creed orcolor can weaken its hold on the human heart.   ``I know, because I am a product of that dream.''   Echoing the call for change that has been a fundamental part ofthe his campaign, Dukakis said that ``maintaining the status quo _running in place _ standing still _ isn't good enough for America.Opportunity for some isn't good enough for America.''   Touching on another of his campaign themes _ the need for peopleto work together _ Dukakis talked about ``the idea of community.''   ``It is the idea that we are in this together; that regardlessof who we are or where we come from or how much money we have _each of us counts. And that by working together to createopportunity and a good life for all _ all of us are enriched _ notjust in economic terms, but as citizens and as human beings.''   He said that as president he would ``set goals for our country;not goals for our government working alone; I mean goals for ourpeople working together.''   Four years from now, he said he hoped people would ``be proud oftheir government; proud of a government that sets high standardsnot just for the American people, but high standards for itself.''</TEXT></DOC>
