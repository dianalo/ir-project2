Ed Wolfe, the State Department's ambassador for oceans andfisheries, said the agreement would be initialed after both sidesreviewed the final text. Before it could go into force, both nationswill have to formally sign it.   Under the agreement, U.S. enforcement officers will have``unrestricted authority'' to board and inspect Korean drift netvessels to search for evidence of illegal fishing and all Koreandrift net vessels will have to be equipped with satellitetransponders by the 1990 fishing season, Wolfe said.   The transponders will allow U.S. officials to keep track of thelocation of the Korean vessels to ensure they don't fish outside ofdesignated drift net fishing areas.   The agreeement also calls for scientific monitoring of the Koreanfleet and will allow the Koreans to fish in an expanded area in theNorth Pacific during the month of May.   President Bush warned the Koreans two weeks ago that they faced apossible ban on shipments of their fishery products to the UnitedStates if they hadn't reached an agreement by the end of September.   Drift net treaties were earlier negotiated with Japan and Taiwan.   Wolfe said the State Department was satisfied with the tentativepact with the Koreans and talks with the Koreans had been ``moredifficult'' than those he conducted with the Japanese and Taiwanese.   More than 700 driftnet vessels from Japan, Taiwan and Korea havebeen using drift nets in the North Pacific ostensibly to catchsquid. But U.S. fishing groups have claimed the vessels are actuallyfishing for North American salmon and that runs in Alaska,Washington state and Oregon have already suffered as a result of theillegal catch.   Environmentalists, who call the nets ``walls of death,'' havesaid their use results in the deaths of thousands of marine mammalsand seabirds annually.   The lighweight, monofilament nets can stretch for more than 30miles and hang in the water snaring any animal they come in contactwith. On any given day, the nets can cover an estimated 30,000 milesof ocean.   Congressional reaction to the Korean agreement was guarded.   Sen. Frank Murkowski, R-Alaska, said he was satisfied with thetreaty's enforcement provisions, but was critical of the expandedfishing zone for Korean vessels in May and the scientific observerprogram.   ``All these countries ought to be held to the same standard, andthat should be as rigid as necessary to protect our interests,''said Murkowski.   Rep. Jolene Unsoeld, D-Wash., who has introduced legislationcalling for an international ban on the use of drift nets, said``it's important to remember that these are just monitoringagreements. The drift net fleets will continue intercepting oursalmon and indiscriminately slaughtering the world's marine life.   ``We will just have a little better idea of the extent they aredoing that.''</TEXT></DOC>
