The move puts George D. Gould, a former U.S. Treasuryundersecretary, in charge of selling off and reinvesting theassets of Drexel and its subsidiaries. Mr. Gould, 62 yearsold, is now vice chairman of Klingenstein, Fields andamp; Co., aNew York money-management firm, and will not relinquish thatpost.</LP><TEXT>   Drexel filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S.Bankruptcy Code in February and began liquidating its assets.   The appointment of Mr. Gould stems from a dispute overwhether the creditors should be privy to Drexel's liquidationplans. Although the company and the creditors had earlieroperated under an oversight procedure that gave creditorsnotice of the transactions, Drexel backed out of thatarrangement in late May -- spurring the creditors to beginlegal action demanding a role in reviewing the liquidationtransactions.   The new arrangement, negotiated under the supervision offederal bankruptcy Judge Howard Buschman III, goes far beyondthe earlier review process. While previously Drexel decidedon the transactions -- after conferring with creditors -- nowMr. Gould will decide. He will serve as the chairman and onlyvoting member of a court-appointed investment committee. Theother members of the committee will be one representativeeach of Drexel, the parent's creditors' committee and thecreditors' committee of Drexel's brokerage unit.   &quot;This provides an unprecedented degree of intervention byan outsider in a bankruptcy proceeding,&quot; said Wilbur Ross ofRothschild Inc., financial adviser to the parent'screditors'committee. &quot;It's a more elaborate process than wehad before. It is more powerful than what we had.&quot;   Mr. Ross said the arrangement will speed up efforts towork out a reorganization plan for Drexel because iteliminates the likelihood of court battles between the debtorand creditors over the asset liquidation.   A Drexel spokesman said, &quot;We view this as a workablesolution in our effort to maximize the value of our assets.&quot;   Mr. Gould, well known to players on both sides of thecase, said his appointment is &quot;an attempt to come up with areferee. . . . My employer, if you will, is the court. I mustbe fair to both the creditors and Drexel.&quot;   Under the new plan, Drexel management will recommendsecurities transactions to Mr. Gould. He will make decisionsafter consulting with the committee. Any member can appealMr. Gould's decision to Judge Buschman. The arrangement alsorequires Drexel to provide a regular update of its securitiestransactions and the value of its assets to the creditors'financial advisers. The review process will continue at leastuntil early November, when a Drexel reorganization plan isexpected to be proposed.   Mr. Gould will be paid $37,500 a month. Mr. Ross said Mr.Gould was selected from a list of more than 30 candidates.

The Federal Aviation Administration's analysis of theenvironmental impacts of the new Denver airport, now underconstruction, wasn't fatally flawed by the use ofinappropriate noise standards, the District of Columbia U.S.Court of Appeals ruled.   A group of residents who live north of the airportcontended that the FAA had inadequately addressed theirconcerns that noise from airplanes using the airport wouldharm waterfowl and other wildlife at the Barr Lake StatePark, northeast of the airport site. The judges agreed thatthe FAA had used noise standards with no relevance to thewildlife refuge. Nevertheless, they ruled, the FAA'sconclusion that the new airport wouldn't substantiallyincrease the noise levels could have been reached using otherdata included in the environmental impact statement.   Attorneys for the city and county of Denver said thedecision removes the last legal roadblock to the $2.3 billionairport, expected to be a hub for Continental Airlines andUnited Airlines.   The decision could help smooth the way for Chicago, Dallasand other cities to build new airports or expand existingones.   ---   NORIEGA'S ATTORNEYS WIN a round in their efforts to getpaid.   U.S. Magistrate William C. Turnoff ruled in favor of thelawyers late Thursday in a hearing to determine whether threeEuropean banks should release information about accounts thatmay contain funds belonging to the deposed Panamanian leader.   Manuel Noriega's attorneys, led by Frank Rubino, have beentrying to unfreeze about $5 million in assets from Europeanbank accounts so that Mr. Noriega will be able to pay for hisdefense. In June, the U.S. government agreed to help thedefense lawyers unfreeze the assets.   Mr. Rubino had subpoenaed records from the three banks --Deutsche-Sudamerkanische Bank of Hamburg, West Germany; UnionBank of Switzerland in Zurich, and the Marseille, France,branch of Paris-based Credit Lyonnais -- in late June andearly July. The banks, however, moved to quash the subpoenas,saying bank secrecy laws in their countries prohibited themfrom releasing the documents.   After hearing arguments Thursday, Magistrate Turnoff gavethe banks 14 days to comply with the subpoenas.   The banks could appeal the decision to U.S. District JudgeWilliam M. Hoeveler, who is presiding over the Noriega trial.   ---   JUSTICE THURGOOD MARSHALL WAS HOSPITALIZED for observationafter suffering a fall in a hotel lobby in Chicago.
