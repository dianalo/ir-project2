But I found these and other style suggestions somewhat arbitrarywhen RightWriter missed the redundant use of ''truthful and honest'' in onesentence.andP;  However, I was impressed by RightWriter's ability to offercorrections and suggestions rather than simply point out problems.andM;Of the three approaches, the most successful was, not surprisingly, thewriting consultant.andP;  My little experiment reminded me of the crunchycomplexities of grammar, let alone style and usage.andP;  But rarely do we havethe luxury of a good editor at our disposal.andP;  So, for about $100, grammarcheckers can offer a convenient and inexpensive means for adding a littlepolish to your daily correspondence.andP;  They're far from perfect, but so ismost business writing.andP;  And every little bit helps.andM;----------Mark Tebbe is president of Lante Corp., a Chicago-based microcomputerconsulting firm.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
