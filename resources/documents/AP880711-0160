(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   In this year's Midwest drought, a farmnewspaper found no shortage of dry wit when it asked its readers,``How dry is it?''   Blair Sawall of Clintonville said it was so dry that a certainsnack food company offered to buy his corn curls _ right out of theground.   Dave Stowell of Burlington said his sweet corn was growing sodeep in search of moisture that the roots were being trimmed by afellow farmer _ in Australia.   They were among more than 100 farm readers responding to thequestion posed by the Wisconsin State Farmer newspaper as theMidwest suffered through its most severe dry spell in years.   John Naparalla of Neshkoro said it was so dry that the creek wassqueaking as it rounded the bends and the spawning carp gotsunburned.   On a similar theme, Lloyd Kirsch of Gillett said it was so drythat the baby frogs reached 4 months old and hadn't learned to swim.   And Alan Cihlar of Mosinee said it was so dry that even thedam-building beavers were joining farmers in applying for statewater diversion permits.   Becky Kuehnel of Newton reported it was so dry there that:   _Cattle exports are up, but so are camel imports;   _No water spaniels were born this year;   _And the futures market has a new category _ dried beef.   A number of northern Illinois readers were also among therespondents.   For example, W.J. Hollad of Tiskilwa, Ill., reported his fieldswere so parched that the milkweed went dry, the quack grass quitquacking and the coffee weed wasn't making any coffee.</TEXT></DOC>
