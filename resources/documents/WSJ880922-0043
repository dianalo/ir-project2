Birnbaum (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><G> EXE </G><DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   George Bush's high command is about to stage a daring raid behind enemy lines.    When the vice president's top aides heard that a Boston police association wanted to endorse Mr. Bush for president, favoring him over their state's own governor, they swung into action.    Pollster Robert Teeter verified that Gov. Michael Dukakis's criminal-furlough program is Mr. Bush's strongest issue. Campaign manager Lee Atwater suggested that the surprise be unveiled just before the two candidates' first debate Sunday. And campaign chairman James Baker and vice presidential chief of staff Craig Fuller had the advance team locate a site quickly and under extra secrecy to reduce the chance of Democratic hecklers.    The result: Mr. Bush today will accept the endorsement of the Boston Police Patrolman's Association at a police station in east Boston, a maneuver calculated to embarrass the Massachusetts governor and get some easy television time for the vice president.    The skill and experience of George Bush's campaign staff overwhelmed Michael Dukakis in the first weeks of this campaign. Especially since former Treasury Secretary Baker arrived last month to head the vice president's effort, it has become &quot;a textbook campaign,&quot; laments Mark Siegel, a member of the Democratic National Committee. In a close battle, analysts from both parties say, the well-seasoned Bush political team could provide a decisive edge.    Reaction time is swift, which is a vital requirement in the general election: A new Dukakis thrust can be met with a quick Bush parry, as last week, when the campaign learned that the Massachusetts governor had scheduled a series of events emphasizing national defense. An attack on the Democratic nominee's positions was promptly inserted into a rally meant to appeal to Hispanic voters.    Moreover, the high command's cohesiveness helps ensure that the campaign speaks with one voice, zeroing in on a desired message and making sure that it doesn't get blurred or the candidate distracted by other issues. Every day the vice president travels, his nationwide network of political operatives and surrogate campaigners knows exactly what his &quot;line of the day&quot; is, and they are instructed not to deviate from it.    Their discipline and skill can't prevent the candidate from occasionally garbling the message -- as when, for example, he confused the anniversary of Pearl Harbor. But in general, the Bush effort has been far more successful in hammering home its message than has Mr. Dukakis, who sometimes allows his themes to get clouded.    With the return of John Sasso to the Dukakis campaign over the Labor Day weekend, the competence gap between the two camps has narrowed considerably. But overall, the Republicans still seem to better understand strategy and tactics in a general election.    In contrast to the relatively green Dukakis staff, the top Bush team is made up of old hands with experience in numerous national campaigns -- people such as Messrs. Baker, Atwater and Teeter, media adviser Roger Ailes and veteran Reagan advisers Stuart Spencer and Kenneth Khachigian, who are spending most of their time riding herd on vice presidential nominee Dan Quayle.    These men are tough and cynical. &quot;Landslide,&quot; a new book about the Reagan presidency by Jane Mayer and Doyle McManus, captures some of the flavor of how they approach their work. In a transcript of a 1984 strategy meeting on the president's campaign, the emphasis is on what will sell with the voters; lacking is any attempt to build the campaign around positions by which the candidate might actually govern.    The candidate himself is regarded as a mouthpiece and a commodity to be sold. Mr. Spencer even went so far as to suggest it would help the reelection bid of Mr. Reagan, who was shot by an assailant in 1981, &quot;if he got a bullet in the toe.&quot;    Talking about a speech to the United Nations that the president was scheduled to deliver, Mr. Khachigian suggests the gimmick of having the president point to the Soviet delegation seated nearby and say, &quot;See, there isn't such a big gulf between us&quot; -- to which Mr. Spencer replies, &quot;He'd probably point to the Puerto Ricans.&quot; (The president did use this tactic successfully, pointing directly at the Soviet representatives.)    When Mr. Teeter worries that people might begin to blame Mr. Reagan for things going wrong in the country, Mr. Spencer demurs, noting that in his 1970 gubernatorial campaign Mr. Reagan successfully &quot;ran against the . . . government he was running.&quot;    Mr. Spencer continues: &quot;I mean, he believes he's above it all. He believes it. That's why they believe it. I can't believe it, but they do.&quot; Mr. Teeter urges having the president attend functions with young people, to &quot;help inoculate against the idea that he doesn't know what's going on.&quot;    The same sort of machinations often seem to steer the Bush-Quayle campaign. Guided daily by polls, they focus on the issues that are the most compelling to the public; campaign events are then geared to take maximum advantage. Understanding the shallowness of most network television campaign coverage, the Bush aides are masters of the brief sound bite and arresting picture that will ensure that the candidate gets on the evening newscasts.    With campaign strategists sensing rising public anxiety over the environment, the vice president was swiftly dispatched to speak out against acid rain, medical waste washing ashore in New Jersey and pollution in Boston Harbor. After almost a week of GOP events, the presumed natural Democratic advantage on the issue all but disappeared.    Mr. Baker's arrival has helped solidify the campaign structure. &quot;Now that Baker is there, he is making sure the place functions like a Swiss watch,&quot; says Peter Teeley, a Bush adviser. &quot;There is absolutely no question who is Number One.&quot;    Mr. Baker immediately proved his value by completely out-negotiating the untested Dukakis camp in the deliberations over candidate debates. He obtained all his most desired goals: getting the minimum number of debates, not having any in the final three weeks of the campaign and establishing a stilted format that significantly reduces their value.    He gained an advantage in the beginning when he eliminated the only experienced debate negotiator on the Dukakis team, former Walter Mondale aide Richard Moe, by complaining that Mr. Moe had a conflict of interest because he is a member of the Bipartisan Commission on Presidential Debates.    Mr. Baker's most important attribute may be his personal relationship with the candidate. He has been a close friend of Mr. Bush for nearly 30 years and has run his national campaigns since 1980. &quot;When Baker makes a decision, he picks up the phone, talks to the candidate and gets the decision carried out,&quot; Bush adviser Charles Black says. &quot;That's very important in the general election. The velocity of events increases geometrically.&quot;    But even the best-laid plans sometimes go awry. Three days before Sen. Quayle was chosen to be Mr. Bush's running mate, for instance, a newspaper article reported that the senator had moved to the top of Mr. Bush's list of prospects. There has been speculation that agents of Mr. Baker leaked the story in hopes of derailing the selection.    But the ploy failed. Hardly anybody took the story -- or the possibility of Sen. Quayle being chosen -- seriously.    ---                Old Hands vs. New Hands   Number of national general-election campaigns in which the candidates' top aides have previously served at a senior level:   BUSH AIDES                    DUKAKIS AIDES    James Baker              3    John Sasso             1    Lee Atwater              2    Paul Brountas          1    Roger Ailes              2    Susan Estrich          1    Robert Teeter            4    Tom Kiley              1    Stuart Spencer           3    Kirk O'Donnell         0 -</TEXT></DOC>
