The lawyer who represented the plaintiff said he is representing six other dealers in pending lawsuits that make similar allegations about Savin.    Savin, a Stamford, Conn., copier marketer controlled by Canada Development Corp. of Toronto, said it hasn't yet decided whether it will appeal the jury's decision. The verdict came last week in federal court in the Western District of Wisconsin, in a suit brought by Gordon Flesch Co., Madison, Wis.    Savin said the same jury also ordered E. Paul Charlap, Savin's former chairman, to pay Gordon Flesch $400,000 in damages. Gordon Flesch's lawyer, Joseph W. Letzer of Birmingham, Ala., said he had sought total damages of about $10 million. </TEXT></DOC>
