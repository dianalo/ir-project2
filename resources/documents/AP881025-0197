(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Lloyd Bentsen, visiting the farm communitywhere his grandfather first settled in America, renewed hiscounterattack Tuesday against what he called Republican ``lies anddistortions'' about Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis.   ``They say Governor Dukakis opposes the Stealth bomber. And I'mhere to tell you that's a lie, and they know it,'' Bentsen said.   ``They say Governor Dukakis opposed deployment of the Pershing IImissile. And that's a lie, and they know it,'' he said.   The Democrats and Republicans plan to spend the same amount ondefense _ but the Democrats would ``spend those dollars smarter,''he said, for ``planes that fly, guns that work, ammunition and spareparts.''   ``I think the American people want better than lies anddistortions in this campaign,'' he said, challenging Bush to drophis ads attacking Dukakis' defense positions.   The Texas senator, who usually campaigns in states with the mostelectoral votes, was in a state with the fewest _ three. He spoke ina school auditorium to a crowd that was about double the White,S.D., population of 474, and was greeted like a team at ahomecoming, with a band, pompon girls and loud cheering.   Shops around town had greetings in the windows, and one streetwas renamed Bentsen Blvd. for the day.   The senator dropped by the Palace Cafe and Hotel to visit withsome elderly women from the town who went to school with Bentsen's94-year-old father, Lloyd Sr. They told of still receiving gifts offruit from the elder Bentsen, who now lives near McAllen, Texas.   Getting his father on the phone after a while, the senatorassured him ``they even told some good things about you.'' The phonegot handed around the table and they talked of the one-teacherschool where Lloyd Sr. made it through the fifth grade.   The luncheonette's special of the day: The Bentsen Burger, whichat three bucks included potatoes, vegetable, dessert and coffee.   Bentsen helped dedicate the historical museum for the town, whichwas surrounded by sheep, cattle and the fields where Bentsen saidhis grandfather Peter first homesteaded after arriving from Denmarkin 1887. The family survived the first winter in a sod hut byburning straw for heat.   Back on the subject of the election, he said the Republicans'campaign ``robs the heart of democracy. It deprives you of theopportunity to judge the issues and the candidates.''   As the Democrats ``spent critical weeks'' developing solutions toproblems such as health care, education, and housing, ``all thewhile our opponents campaigned with a total disregard for thetruth,'' he said. It was the first time Bentsen has offered a reasonwhy the Democrats failed to quickly counter the Republican attacks.   Bentsen delivered the same message later in the day, afterarriving at a West Fargo, N.D., rally on a stagecoach.   Wearing blue jeans, a leather jacket and a Western hat, Bentsenand a local farmer named Jim Haugland drove a team of fourClydesdales into a livestock show area while more than 700supporters hollered their approval.   Bentsen's visit Tuesday to the Dakotas and Montana was the secondtrip to the region by the Democratic ticket since he and MichaelDukakis stopped in Minot, N.D., immediately after the Democraticconvention in July. Dukakis had a rally in Fargo earlier this month.   Bentsen told reporters on his campaign jet that while there wereonly 10 electoral votes between the three states, ``it might makethe difference.''   ``Nobody has paid any attention to these states,'' he said.   Sen. Tom Daschle, Minnesota Senate candidate Hubert Humphrey III,North Dakota Gov. George Sinner, and Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont.,joined Bentsen on stage at the school, which had an enormousAmerican flag as a backdrop.</TEXT></DOC>
