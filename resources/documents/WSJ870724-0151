Europe's rigid labor laws appear to have turned labor into a fixed cost. While these laws may protect the lucky workers with jobs, they tend to militate against young workers looking for work. The relatively high European unemployment rates, especially among young people, support this hypothesis.    Your graph on employment growth, however, strikes me as misleading. It shows growth in total employment, without proper adjustment for overall population growth. Between 1970 and 1986, for example, the West German population remained stationary at 60.7 million while that of the U.S. grew from 205 million to 241 million. Consequently, over the same period the labor force (people working or wishing to work) in West Germany grew from 26.2 million to only 27 million (that is, by only 3%), while the U.S. labor force grew from 82.8 million to 115.5 million (that is, by more than 39%).    It is misleading to compare American with European growth rates in employment (and in gross national product, for that matter) without adjusting for these demographic trends, as is so often done on this side of the Atlantic. The American economy may have been a bit more productive in creating jobs than have its European counterparts. The main difference in economic growth, however, reflects the fact that our population is still growing quite rapidly while Europe's is not at all. Perhaps we are better lovers, but experts question even that hypothesis.    Prof. Uwe E.
