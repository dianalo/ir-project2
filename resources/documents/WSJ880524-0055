Cohen and Ed Bean (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> ELUXY MYO </CO><IN> TNM FIN </IN><TEXT>   A federal judge in Nashville, Tenn., lifted an order against AB Electrolux, of Sweden, allowing the company to proceed with a hostile takeover bid for Murray Ohio Manufacturing Co.    Electrolux didn't waste any time. After the court's ruling, the company announced plans to boost its bid for the Brentwood, Tenn.-based maker of lawnmowers and bicycles. In fact, Electrolux launched a formal cash tender offer of $52 a share, or $197.1 million, up from its earlier proposal of $48 a share, or $182 million.    Murray had sought a preliminary injunction barring Electrolux from pursuing its bid. The company had charged that the unsolicited bid was based, in part, on confidential information Electrolux received from Sullivan andamp; Cromwell, a New York law firm. In early 1987, Sullivan andamp; Cromwell was hired by Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co., Murray's investment banker, to help advise Murray about how to defend against an unwanted takeover attempt. Murray had said the law firm's work for Electrolux represented a conflict of interest.    However, in a ruling closely watched by takeover lawyers and legal ethics specialists, Judge Thomas A. Wiseman denied Murray's request for a preliminary injunction and lifted a temporary restraining order issued earlier this month that barred the Swedish maker of appliances and lawn and garden products from proceeding with its bid. He didn't find any evidence indicating that Sullivan andamp; Cromwell had given Electrolux any confidential information about Murray.    The ruling came after the market closed. Yesterday in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Murray shares fell 87.5 cents to close at $51.375.    The judge said in an oral ruling late yesterday that while Sullivan andamp; Cromwell had &quot;a substantial amount&quot; of financial information about Murray, that information could have been gleaned from public documents.    &quot;We are gratified that the court's decision resolving the issues before it on the basis of the evidence confirmed the position we have taken since this matter began,&quot; said John Warden, a Sullivan andamp; Cromwell partner. &quot;It was our view all along that there was nothing wrong with our taking the matter on.&quot;    Despite its contention that there was never a conflict, Sullivan andamp; Cromwell withdrew earlier this month as Electrolux's counsel because it thought that Electrolux's bid would be harmed by the law firm's continued representation of the company. &quot;We wanted to avoid this sideshow,&quot; Mr. Warden said.    Takeover specialists said that even though the judge found no evidence of wrongdoing on Sullivan andamp; Cromwell's part, other law firms would be more vigilant about evaluating potential conflicts before taking on clients in the future. &quot;This will provoke law firms to re-evaluate their procedures for resolving conflicts,&quot; said Jonathan Lerner, a parter with the New York law firm of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher andamp; Flom.    Clients, too, are more likely to ask more questions of law firms before retaining them. &quot;Clients might think twice before hiring a firm,&quot; said Stephen Jacobs, a partner with Weil, Gotshal andamp; Manges, a New York firm. Other attorneys said that more takeover targets might try to challenge law firms. &quot;We're seeing more lawyers and investment bankers being challenged,&quot; said Stephen Volk, a partner with Shearman andamp; Sterling, a New York firm. &quot;In takeover battles now the tendency is to try to attack the adviser.&quot;    Sullivan andamp; Cromwell attorneys had reason to worry that the ruling wouldn't be in their or Electrolux's favor. Last week, in an unusual move, Judge Wiseman discredited the testimony of Ricardo Mestres, a Sullivan andamp; Cromwell partner who had represented Goldman Sachs and Murray last year. And earlier this month, the judge said if Sullivan andamp; Cromwell had obtained confidential information from Murray and later represented Electrolux, &quot;they ought to be disbarred.&quot;    In a letter to Murray's board, Anders Scharp, president and chief executive officer of Electrolux, said &quot;Our strong preference has always been, and continues to be, to acquire Murray in a negotiated, friendly transaction.&quot; He said Electrolux planned its tender offer because of Murray's &quot;unwillingness to enter into discussions.&quot;    Mr. Scharp urged Murray's board not to take any further steps to thwart a takeover by Electrolux. &quot;We trust that the board of Murray is mindful of its fiduciary obligations,&quot; he said in the letter.    Electrolux said its offer for Murray is subject to its purchase of two-thirds of Murray's shares; to Murray's redemption of its poison pill plan; and to an assurance that the Ohio Control Share Acquisition Act is inapplicable. Electrolux has asked a federal court in Ohio, where Murray is incorporated, to issue a ruling that the anti-takeover act won't thwart the bid.    The offer expires at 12:01 a.m. EDT June 22, unless extended. </TEXT></DOC>
