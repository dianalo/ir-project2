Bruce Smart, undersecretary of commerce for international trade, said the department urged the White House to reconstitute the Export Administration Review Board to avert delays and inaction on export-licensing issues. The problems, a source of frustration to U.S. exporters, result from disagreements between the Pentagon -- which generally takes a hard-line approach to export-licensing issues -- and the Commerce Department, which puts relatively greater emphasis on promoting exports.    The Export Administration Review Board was created by President Kennedy in 1961, but it &quot;hasn't been used effectively in recent years,&quot; Mr. Smart said. During the past two years, Commerce Department aides argued, the Pentagon often stalled board action on export-control matters. But they said other agencies, fearing they lacked strength to persuade the White House to set aside Pentagon objections, were reluctant to take their case to the president.    Under the new Commerce Department proposal, the Pentagon or any other dissenter from a board decision would have to bear the burden of proof in appealing a decision to the White House.    The board is led by the secretary of commerce and made up of the secretaries of defense, state and energy.    In another move to restore &quot;balance&quot; to the panel's decision-making, the Commerce Department proposal would reinstate the treasury secretary as a member of the board. The treasury seat was eliminated during a Carter administration reorganization. The Commerce Department contends it should be restored because of the profound impact export controls have on the U.S. trade balance.    A revived board could take up a number of export-control revisions that the Commerce Department proposed last year. These include a proposal to eliminate export controls on foreign products containing U.S. components if the value of those parts doesn't exceed 20% of the value of the entire products. Another such proposal that has languished since last year was to waive licensing requirements for foreign buyers whose reliability can be certified.    Some U.S. exporters were skeptical that the Commerce Department's plan to resurrect the board would help. &quot;If the Commerce Department and the Pentagon can't resolve their differences head-to-head, I don't know how bringing in a roomful of other people will help,&quot; said Eric Hirshhorn, a former Commerce Department lawyer who now represents technology-exporting companies.    The board could operate alongside another dispute-resolving mechanism that the White House established in 1984, Mr. Smart said. This system provides for arbitration of interagency disputes by the National Security Council. A National Academy of Sciences study released last week advised the Reagan administration to strengthen this process.    Mr. Smart said the administration is determined to remove unnecessary burdens on U.S. exporters. He said the administration plans to seek greater cooperation on export-control issues between the U.S. and its allies. He also said the U.S. will try at a meeting next month of the Coordinating Committee on Multilateral Export Controls to enlist allied help in urging nonaligned nations to cooperate more fully in export controls. Cocom, as the Paris-based body is called, is made up of the U.S., Japan and 15 North Atlantic Treaty Organization allies.    Ambassador Robert Dean, the State Department's senior representative for strategic technology policy, will head the U.S. delegation. Two other top U.S. policymakers -- Assistant Secretary of Defense Richard Perle and Assistant Secretary of Commerce Paul Freedenberg -- will be part of the team. The other Cocom members will be represented at a &quot;high political level,&quot; Mr. Smart said. </TEXT></DOC>
