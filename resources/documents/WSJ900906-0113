The finding adds to the growing body of evidence thatnonsmokers' health may be damaged by other people's smoke. Itis one of the first studies to find that parents who smokepresent a potential cancer risk to their children.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;It may be particularly important to protect children andadolescents from this environmental hazard,&quot; say the authorsof the report, published in today's edition of the NewEngland Journal of Medicine.   But the report found no statistically significant linkbetween lung cancer among nonsmokers and spouses who smoke,or environmental smoke from the workplace or social settingssuch as restaurants -- a development a representative of thetobacco industry considered encouraging.   The report &quot;is in agreement with what we've been saying{about} environmental tobacco smoke in the workplace, thehome and social settings for adults,&quot; said Steve Parrish,vice president, corporate scientific affairs, at PhilipMorris Cos., New York. He also played down the significanceof the conclusion about the impact on children, sayingseveral other studies didn't turn up any evidence ofincreased cancer risk.   Mr. Parrish said the report supports the industry'sposition that there isn't any justification for banning useof tobacco in the workplace.   The study's findings were based on interviews with 191nonsmokers recently diagnosed with lung cancer in 23 countiesin New York State as well as 191 nonsmoking control subjects,matched by age, sex and county of residence.   The researchers, led by Dwight T. Janerich, anepidemiologist at the Yale University School of Medicine, NewHaven, Conn., focused on exposure to tobacco smoke in thehousehold, although they also queried participants aboutworkplace and social setting exposures.   Why children would be vulnerable to cancer is a questionfor further study, Dr. Janerich said, but he speculated thattheir lungs could be more suspectible to damage from smokethan those of adults or that a long latency period isrequired for the cancer to develop. The average age of cancerpatients in the study was about 67. Dr. Janerich disputedthat the report undermined previous research showing a 38%increased risk of lung cancer for nonsmokers living withsmoking spouses. He also said non-household data wasn'tsufficiently firm to reach definitive conclusions.   The study estimated that 17% of lung cancer amongnonsmokers &quot;can be attributed to high levels of exposure tocigarette smoke&quot; at home when they were under 21 years old.The scientists defined high levels as at least 25&quot;smoker-years&quot; of exposure -- a calculation based on thenumber of years a person lived in a residence multiplied bythe number of people in the household who smoked.   The researchers acknowledged that the findings could havebeen affected by the differences in the ability ofparticipants to recall details of lifetime tobacco exposure.</TEXT></DOC>
