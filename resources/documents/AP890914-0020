(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Evangelist Oral Roberts, the faith healer whobuilt a religious empire on the credo ``expect a miracle,'' says hecan't wait for divine intervention to save his ministry's hospitaland medical school.   Because of $25 million in debts, the hospital will be closed bythe end of the year and the medical school next year, Roberts saidWednesday. His home, four other ministry-owned houses and auniversity housing complex will be sold to pay off the debts, hesaid.   ``I hope we can look back at this and say this wasn't afailure,'' the 71-year-old pioneer of television evangelism toldreporters. ``I don't think it's as bad a day as it seems. I thinkwe'll look back on this and think it's the right thing.''   Roberts said the action would help keep the 4,300-student OralRoberts University financially secure.   Mayor Rodger Randle agreed, adding that the City of Faithhospital, which opened in 1981, ``was born in controversy and was abig gamble on the proposition that a national medical market couldbe created.''   Roberts built the hospital with a 777-bed capacity, but stateregulators only approved filling 294 beds, and the highest averageoccupancy was 148 in 1984. Still Roberts said, ``I would do itagain.''   The ministry's financial problems were compounded by a drop inmonthly contributions that Roberts blamed on a ``spirit ofskepticism'' in the wake of scandals involving fellow evangelistsJim Bakker and Jimmy Swaggart.   Roberts, himself, caused a furor in 1986 when he announced heneeded $8 million for his medical school by April 1, 1987, or Godwould end his life. The money was raised.   On Wednesday, Roberts raised the possibility of ``some miracle''providing a $50 million endowment he says is needed.   ``Who knows that when this is known across America that someonewe might have been dealing with, or someone we haven't been dealingwith, might say, `I've got the $50 million,''' Roberts said. But heis not waiting for a benefactor.   ``Integrity means we have to tell our students now,'' Robertssaid. ``We feel that integrity demands that we give them a fullyear's notice.''   Dr. Larry Edwards, dean of the medical school, said its charterwill become inactive when classes end next May, but itsaccreditation could be reactivated later.   The hospital, part of a futuristic complex with 60-story,30-story and 20-story gold-tiled towers, will be leased and therevenue generated dedicated to the ministry's endowment, Robertssaid.   The ministry's five homes and an 830-unit apartment complex willbe sold, said chief fiscal officer Mark Swadener. Oral Roberts'6,328-square-foot, four-bedroom home was valued at about $500,000 in1987. His son Richard's 7,091-square-foot, two-story home was valuedat $547,000 that year.   Swadener did not have an estimate of how much money the actionsannounced Wednesday would generate.   ``After the dust has settled, we'll take a look at it,'' he said.   Roberts said he had an emotional meeting with students, facultyand ministry workers to explain the crisis.   ``I asked the Lord to not let me cry because I've cried all thetears I thought I could cry. And sure enough, I didn't cry,'' hesaid.   Edwards said 600 hospital staff members would be affected.   Many will be able to find work at one of the city's five otherhospitals, predicted Ira Schlezinger, vice president of HillcrestMedical Center in Tulsa.   Edwards said 147 students are enrolled in the medical school, andabout 100 faculty members are on contract until the end of theschool year. Non-graduating students will be assisted in obtainingtransfers to other medical schools, he said.   Students expressed optimism.   ``It's not going to stop me from being a doctor and it's notgoing to stop me from being a medical missionary,'' said DavidChorley.   ``If the $50 million doesn't come in, God will provide me withanother medical school,'' said Doug Rober.</TEXT></DOC>
