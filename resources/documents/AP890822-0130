Also Tuesday, a group of prominent Palestinians met with Israelilegislators in the occupied Gaza Strip despite warnings fromunderground leaders of the uprising not to do so.   The rash of fatalities in the occupied lands prompted commercialstrikes in Arab east Jerusalem as well as in the Palestinian townsof Ramallah to the north and Bethlehem to the south.   Palestinian school officials said the army told them the violencealso would delay the reopening of classes for high school sophomoresand juniors. Teachers earlier were told the classes would resumeWednesday.   West Bank schools were closed for most of the uprising, but havebeen reopened in phases since July.   In the occupied Gaza Strip, 20-year-old Maha Awad Abu Hadath waskilled by a stray shot when a clash erupted between soldiers andmasked, stone-throwing youths in the market of the Deir El-Balahrefugee camp, Arab witnesses said.   Doctors at Ahli Arab Hospital in Gaza City said she was hit inthe head by a rubber-coated metal pellet that troops use for riotcontrol.   A military spokeswoman confirmed the death and said the army wasinvestigating the two other reported deaths.   In the West Bank, 14-year-old Najla Aadel El-Nadi died of abullet wound to the head suffered during a stone-throwingconfrontation with soldiers a week ago in the Askar refugee campnear Nablus, according to doctors at Ramallah Hospital.   In the West Bank's Al-Amari refugee camp, Arab reporters said thebody of Nasser Khalil Shahin Abu Katrina, 17, was found Tuesday witha bullet wound in his chest.   Residents said troops opened fire during clashes in the campMonday night, but the army spokesman's office said it could notconfirm if there was any shooting.   Reporters were banned from entering the camp because of a curfewconfining residents to their homes.   The deaths raised to at least 545 the number of Palestinianskilled since the Palestinian uprising against Israeli rule began inDecember 1987. Thirty-eight Israelis also have died in the violence.   Palestinians have killed 97 fellow Arabs, many suspected ofcollaborating with Israeli authorities.   The death in Al-Amari camp was the second mysterious killing inthe area north of Jerusalem in a week.   On Friday, the body of a Palestinian-American boy was found nearEl-Bireh, adjacent to Ramallah. He had been shot at close range inthe chest.   The family alleged that the boy, 14-year-old Amjad Jibril Tawil,born in Denver, was in army custody before his death and that thebody showed signs of beating and torture.   The army exhumed Tawil's body for an autopsy and announced Mondaythat his death ``was not caused by Israeli security forces.'' It didnot say who killed him.   Dr. Derick Pounder, a Scottish pathologist brought in by theTawil family to conduct an independent autopsy, said Tuesday he wasunable to do so immediately because of ``bureaucratic problems''with Israeli authorities.   In Gaza, Palestinians met with lawmakers from the left-leaningLabor Party and the leftist Citizen's Rights Movement.   Labor member Amir Peretz told Israel radio that some Gazansscheduled to attend the meeting stayed away, apparently because ofunwillingness to meet with Israelis in the ruling parties.   ``This meeting is not considered disobedience of the orders ofthe United National Leadership of the Uprising,'' Gaza lawyerMohammed Abu Shaaban told reporters. ``We met with people that haveno authority.''   The latest leaflet from the underground leadership last weekwarned that Palestinians should ``reject meetings with any Israeli,official or unofficial.''   Peretz told Israel radio that the meeting was part of ongoingefforts to discuss human rights problems in the territories and toreview options for advancing the government's peace plan.   The plan calls for elections in the occupied West Bank and GazaStrip to choose local Palestinians to negotiate with Israel onlimited autonomy for the territories.</TEXT></DOC>
