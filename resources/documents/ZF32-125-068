 The other group, which includes Dell Computer Corp., ZeosInternational Ltd., Swan Technologies, Northgate Computer Systems Inc. andElek-Tek Inc., eschews ordinary PC reseller distribution channels and optsfor direct sales through mail and telephone orders.andM;The success of the discounters, as a group, reflects the fact that thesestandard PCs have become a virtual commodity, with price the only meaningfuldifferentiator.andP;  Discounters such as AST Research prosper because they knowhow to operate more cost-effectively than the leaders and will accept lowerprofits.andM;The mail order houses also appeal to the market on the basis of price.andP;  Thesevendors gain a price advantage over the premium brands by relying on theirin-house telemarketing staffs, rather than distributing their clones throughdealers.andM;Retailers distributing PCs and similar products typically retain about 40percent of the end-user price.andM;Lower PricesandM;By eliminating the middleman, the mail order seller can pass on to the buyerpart of the resulting savings in the form of lower prices.andP;  Because it hashigher selling (and support) expenses, the mail order house's costs are about70 percent of the end-user price, but it can afford to share the remaining 30percent with customers.andM;What about the quality of maintenance and technical support services offeredby the clone makers?andP;  In these days of tollfree telephone service and remotediagnostics, the computer discounters have little difficulty in matching, ifnot exceeding, the quality and responsiveness of the industry leaders.andM;Their technical staffs resolve most service calls on the phone.andP;  For complexproblems, say in a network, these vendors have contracts with third-partymaintenance providers such as Bell Atlantic Corp. or TRW Inc. for on-siteservice.andM;For large-volume federal PC buys, the indefinite-delivery/indefinite-quantityprocurements where price competition is rampant, the well-known manufacturerslike IBM and Apple Computer Inc. more often than not bid the lowest prices.andM;However Everex has won large contracts from the Department of VeteransAffairs, the Army and the Postal Service.andP;  And in the case of onesies andtwosies, the discounters often enjoy a price advantage and are taking marketshare.andM;In the current soft economic environment, the corporate world also is takingnotice of this more cost-effective distribution channel.andP;  Thus the clonemakers have been riding high, although they are living precariously under theprice umbrella set out by IBM and the other big boys.andM;Competing on price over the long haul requires the computer discounter toprocure the pieces making up his clone at ever-lower prices.andP;  To assemble PCsin moderate volume, the discounter must work with commodity producers ofcomponents such as displays, keyboards and motherboards.andM;Such manufacturers more often than not are located in the Far East,especially in Taiwan.andP;  Happily, there is a fit between the clone makers andthese off-shore vendors, who badly need a recognized brand name to facilitateU.S.andP;  distribution of their commodity products.andM;In some cases, the off-shore vendors are buying part or all of a computerdiscounter before the stock market spots its value.andP;  By buying a recognizedbrand and its distribution channel in the United States, the off-shore vendorshould obtain a higher gross margin on his commodity products.andM;Making It PayandM;That is the theory.andP;  But the theory does not always work out in practice.andM;Early last year California-based Wyse Technology, with fiscal 1990 sales wellover $400 million, was acquired by Channel Industries, a Taiwanesegovernment-backed conglomerate, for $150 million.andM;This was no bargain, considering that in that year Wyse probably lost closeto $20 million.andP;  Nevertheless, to gain entry into the U.S.andP;  market anddistribute its Taiwan production under the Wyse brand name, Channel waswilling to pay a hefty price.andM;Did the maneuver pan out?andP;  No.andP;  Eighteen months later, the Wyse brand name onPCs has little visibility in the United States.andP;  (Wyse also makes IBM3270-compatible terminals, and that product line may be doing better).andM;For the same reason and with similar results last year, Acer Inc., Taiwan'slargest clone manufacturer, acquired Altos Computer Systems for its brandname and its distribution channel.andM;Nonetheless, this ulta-competitive industry is likely to see more such movesin the not-too-distant future.andM;Ulric Weil is president of Weil andamp; Associates, a Washington consulting firm.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
