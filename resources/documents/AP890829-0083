The Hipparcos 1 satellite did not have enough thrust to reachorbit, said Learco Saporito, undersecretary of the Ministry ofScientific Research.

The satellite, built by French and Italian companies, was to takemeasurements of about 400 stars to help calculate the dimensions ofthe universe, said Luciano Guerriero, president of the Italian spaceagency.   The information was to have been integrated with observationsfrom the U.S. space telescope, which is scheduled to be launchedsoon.
