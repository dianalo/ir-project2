Mr. Scannell, who has been assistant secretary of laborfor OSHA since October 1989, notified Labor Secretary LynnMartin of his departure plan yesterday, to take effect Jan.17. The 57-year-old Mr. Scannell will become vice presidentof Johnson andamp; Johnson for safety. He previously managed safetyand environmental affairs for the health care productscompany, but not as a vice president.</LP><TEXT>   As OSHA chief, Mr. Scannell has been widely praised bymost employer and labor groups, though there have been a fewdissenters in both camps.   Joseph Kinney, head of the National Safe WorkplaceInstitute, a Chicago-based advocacy group and formerly aharsh critic of OSHA, calls Mr. Scannell an &quot;extremelyconscientious&quot; regulator. Employers say Mr. Scannell hasworked more closely with them than his predecessors have; butincreased OSHA fines, which have been most recently boostedby Congress, sometimes spark protests.   A United Steelworkers union official says Mr. Scannellgets &quot;high marks&quot; for his regulatory work, for such things asincluding union views into enforcement cases more than OSHAhad done in the past. But Robert Wages, president of the OilChemical and Atomic Workers, has insisted his union was shutout of some chemical-plant enforcement efforts.   Mr. Scannell has raised substantially the level of finesimposed on companies that violate federal standards for workplace safety and health. He has also moved along rule makingfor tougher standards in petrochemical and other industries,and begun efforts that could lead to ground breakingregulations for on-the-job use of motor vehicles andrestricting smoking at work sites.   Mr. Scannell has also sought to develop new &quot;ergonomics&quot;requirements, involving the adaptation of the work placeenvironment for safer and healthier job conditions, such asin meatpacking and auto production. The United Food andCommercial Workers union has publicly criticized that policy,however, as relying too much on voluntary efforts bymeatpackers.</TEXT></DOC>
