Thousands of people lined the shores of Governors Island,Brooklyn, Staten Island, New Jersey and Battery Park, standingeight to 10 deep, despite a chill in the air and the threat of rain.   ``I wouldn't miss this _ it's for our first president,'' saidGeorge James, 72, of the Bronx. ``I was in the Navy, the WPA andworked for the post office. That's my whole life for this country.Everything is right here today.''   At night, a 20-minute firework display lit up a cloudy, graysky. A drizzle stopped right before the pyrotechnics began. And, asif on cue, right after the fireworks ended, the rain started again.   At South Street Seaport, 4,000 to 5,000 spectators watched thefireworks display with brilliant colors that reflected off the EastRiver and the glass towers of Wall Street.   Earlier in the day, 13 military ships representing the 13original states entered the harbor from the south under theVerrazano-Narrows Bridge. From the north, down the Hudson River,came 50 commercial and civilian ships, each with a state flag.   Cannons in Battery Park exchanged 13-gun salutes with the shipsentering the harbor.   The show of force was punctuated by a solemn moment when 47white balloons were set aloft to honor the 47 sailors who diedearlier this month aboard the battleship USS Iowa in a gun turretexplosion and fire April 19.   ``We feel profound grief,'' said Mayor Edward Koch, who said theday's ceremony was dedicated to the sailors.   Members of the environmental group Greenpeace and a group calledthe Coalition for a Nuclear-Free Harbor launched a ``peace fleet''to protest the Navy's plan for a port on Staten Island that couldbe used by nuclear-armed ships.   The protesters' fleet consisted of the 106-foot sloopClearwater, a 19-foot Greenpeace boat and five motorized dinghies.They were emblazoned with anti-nuclear banners with such messagesas ``No Nuke Port,'' ``You Can't Evacuate NYC'' and ``Just SayNo.'' Authorities kept protesters' boats away from the larger ships.   ``The bicentennial ought to be celebrated with fireworks, notthe nuclear firepower carried aboard these ships,'' said MichaelImmerso of the coalition.   Spectators said they had other things on their minds.   ``We came to see the Statue of Liberty but you can't get in,''said Dan Baker, 28, of Dunellen, N.J. ``Now, we've got to watchthese big boats, which isn't too bad. The only thing that caught usoff guard was $5 for two small hot dogs and a Coke.''   Saturday's fireworks were a prelude to Sunday's main event, are-enactment of the 1789 inauguration, starring two Georges _ a manfrom Philadelphia acting the part of Washington, and President Bush.   The re-enactment will be followed by a parade through lowerManhattan, including elements of the original 1789 procession andthe centennial parade of 1889.   This weekend is the culmination of a string of celebrations thatbegan 13 years ago with the bicentennial of the Declaration ofIndependence.   Since then, there have been bicentennials of all majorRevolutionary battles, the surrender at Yorktown, the Treaty ofParis, the writing and passing of the Constitution, and othersmaller celebrations.   Saturday's parade of ships _ the biggest in New York since theStatue of Liberty's centennial in 1986 _ took place underbattleship-gray skies, with a crowd in Battery Park peering outinto the harbor while listening to patriotic songs played by anArmy band.   Sunday's festivities will begin with a thanksgiving service atSt. Paul's Chapel of the Parish of Trinity Church, which was builtin 1766.   George Washington prayed at the church following hisinauguration, then worshiped there for the next two years while NewYork was the nation's temporary capital. President Bush was toattend Sunday morning's service.   A special platform and large-screen television were erected forthe noon re-enactment at Federal Hall in lower Manhattan.   Washington's stand-in, William Sommerfield, will take the oathof office using the same Bible that Washington used, which Bushused in his inauguration Jan. 21.</TEXT></DOC>
