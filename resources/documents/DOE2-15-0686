The composition dependence of theunit-cell parameters and the limiting pressures of the phase transformationwere determined. It was established that the composition has virtuallyno effect on the width of the region of the phase transition ({Delta}p)and on the magnitude of the change in the electrical resistance of thealloys studied.</TEXT></DOC>
