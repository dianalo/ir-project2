Surplus wind energy can bestored for later use, and thus minimize the run-time for the diesel generator.The diesel engine can be operated at a high load when running, givingmaximum efficiency of the system. Electrochemical energy storage systemsare available from industry in a number of varieties. Two of the mostwidely used, the Lead-acid and the Nickel/Cadmium alkaline batteriesare treated in this report, and their application in wind/diesel systemsare assessed.</TEXT></DOC>
