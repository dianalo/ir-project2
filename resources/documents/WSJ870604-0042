The Beaverton, Ore.-based maker of high-powered computers for scientific and engineering applications said earlier this week that it will cut one-third of its work force and take a one-time charge of as much as $10 million for consolidation of operations. Slower than expected sales was the reason given for the cutback, but companies that have started shipping competing machines in the past three years say sales and demand are strong.    Competition is heating up in a market that Floating Point pioneered, and for several years, had nearly to itself. Floating Point developed array processors, add-on devices that allow computers to do intensive number-crunching tasks, often called scientific computing. But in the past few years, start-up companies have developed computers that can do scientific functions without an add-on.    &quot;The scientific (computing) market is growing at 40% to 50% a year,&quot; says Richard Shaffer, editor of Computer Letter, &quot;and a lot of that growth is coming off Floating Point's hide.&quot;    The market for such high-powered computers, which may cost anywhere from $100,000 to $1 million, is still small by computer industry standards, but is expected to boom as technological improvements offer buyers more computing power for their money. Sales are expected to be about $300 million this year, and will grow to about $1.2 billion in 1990, says Jeff Canin, an analyst for Hambrecht andamp; Quist in San Francisco.    In an example of the new competition, Mr. Canin expects two recent start-up companies, Convex Computer Corp., Richardson, Texas, and Alliant Computer Systems Corp., Littletown, Mass., to have more revenues from their minisupercomputers this year than Floating Point.    Convex, which began shipping in late 1984, posted revenue of $40 million last year; this year, revenue is expected to nearly double. Frank Vince, Convex's vice president of marketing, says Floating Point's &quot;marketplace is being undercut by integrated machines,&quot; that offer easier programming. Convex, which sells primarily to scientific market, sees a strong demand for its machines, which cost between $350,000 and $1 million, Mr. Vince says.    Floating Point introduced minisupercomputers in 1981 that worked in conjunction with other computer systems. The company first introduced two types of stand-alone minisupercomputers in 1986. &quot;Our philosophy has not been to replace, but to extend and enhance existing computer systems,&quot; says Gibson Grant, Floating Point's manager of marketing communications.    Mr. Gibson says minisupercomputers account for more than half of Floating Point's sales, and that they are &quot;the bread and butter&quot; of the company. He says, in defense of the add-on philosophy, that some machines made by industry newcomers are also used with other computers, such as in configuration with workstations.    Some of Floating Point's problems go back to April 1986, when it introduced its T series supercomputer only to meet with less than expected sales. For its third quarter ended July 31, 1986, the company posted its first quarterly loss in seven years.    Floating Point was also hit with shareholder lawsuits that claimed company officials made misleading statements about the T series machine, artificially inflating its stock price. Lloyd Turner, the company's president, chief executive officer and chief operating officer resigned in October. When the most recent staff cuts become effective June 15, Floating Point will have about half as many employees as it did at this time last year. For the year ended Oct. 31, the company posted a loss of $14.3 million, on revenue of $88.6 million.    &quot;They're playing catch-up, but they will be a survivor,&quot; predicts Mr. Canin. He says future releases of software for Floating Point's machines will give them stand-alone capability and make them easier to program. Some customers may still see the ability to hook into an existing International Business Machines Corp. or Digital Equipment Corp. system as an advantage, and Floating Point's products have a reputation for good performance, he says.    Adds Computer Letter's Mr. Shaffer, &quot;Floating Point is an old man compared to (the industry's newcomers). They're just pups. Floating Point's got a recognized name, and they can capitalize on it, if they don't make more mistakes. But you only get so many chances.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
