(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>A new look for oldandM;Sometimes it pays to be the technological leader in the PC business andsometimes it doesn't -- and the drawback is that it's impossible to work outall the ramifications in advance.andM;Hewlett-Packard, for example, certainly took a lead with the arrival of theoriginal LaserJet printer, and with more than 1,000 applications using theLaserJet's Printer Control Language (PCL) to drive 80 to 85 per cent of alllaser printers worldwide, leadership seems to equal lucre.andP;  HP's dominance ofthe early laser printer market, along with its wide software support, startedup the LaserJet clone business and is still encouraging more clones toappear.andP;  So what can a leader do, except change the ground it's competing on?andM;With the arrival of the long awaited LaserJet III and its new PCL Version 5,the cloners will find it that much harder to steal HP's market share.andP;  TheLaserJet III has built-in scaleablefont technology, using font outlines tocreate text at any size and take away some of the edge that has givenPostScript its 10 per cent market share.andP;  It has 1Mb RAM as standard, andwhat HP calls Resolution Enhancement, which is a means of smoothing the edgesof text and graphics and improving grey-scale transitions by usingsmaller-than-normal printed dots.andM;The cloners will find it hard to reproduce these features, except for the RAMcapacity.andP;  The font-scaling technology, developed in conjunction withCompugraphic, is proprietary and would require licensing to be used.andM;Other manufacturers may also find it harder to clone PCL 5 than it was toemulate the original PCL.andP;  With PCL 5, HP has finally merged the normalraster graphics of the LaserJet family with the vector graphics of itsplotter line, so that the LaserJet III can be used efficiently as a plotteror a printer according to the application driving it.andP;  It also removes thelimit on the number of fonts per page, adds the ability to use multiple printdirections on a single page, supports white-on-black printing and paterned orgrey-scale fonts, and has automatic rotation of fonts and graphics as thepage orientation is changed.andM;Naturally, all this has been added without losing compatibility with theversion of PCL built into the successful LaserJet family.andP;  Applications thatdon't have specific support for the LaserJet III will drive the printer asthough it were a LaserJet II, although some of the new features of theprinter -- particularly scaleable fonts -- aren't accessible this way.andP;  Allexisting HP and third-party soft fonts can also be used with PCL 5.andM;The built-in HPGL support is actually a new graphics control language for allHP devices, called HPGL/2.andP;  It offers vector graphics tools familiar from theplotter market, and HP claims that it's faster.andP;  The language works withinPCL applications -- so that a complex vector plot, for example, could beembedded in a document also containing text and raster graphics -- and canreplot without tying up the computer.andP;  Like PostScript, PCL is a 'pagedescription language' (PDL) rather than a crude printer driver, although PCLcommands are actually sent using 'escape sequences' just like those thatswitch on condensed print in a cheap dot-matrix printer, say.andM;With any PDL, sets of commands are sent by the computer to build up the pageimage in the printer's memory before final printing.andP;  But, with earlier PCLversions, HP couldn't deliver the flexibility of PostScript, particularlywhen users wanted scaleable outline fonts, unlimited fonts per page, and easyrotation of text and graphics.andM;At the heart of the printer, though, there's basically the same technology asthe LaserJet II.andP;  The print engine is the same Canon SX as the older printer,which gives the LaserJet III the same 300dpi basic resolution and eightpage-per-minute speed as the II.andP;  It also means that the same EP-S tonercartridges can be used for both.andP;  More compatibility has also been providedby making the two font cartridge slots and the paper and envelope trays ofthe III identical with those of the II, although the memory expansion boards-- which can take LaserJet III RAM up to a maximum 5Mb -- aren'tinterchangeable.andM;This RAM-board incompatibility isn't too surprising among the othercompatibilities, given that the new features of the LaserJet III all involvechanges to the controller electronics and software of the printer whileleaving the print engine substantially unchanged.andP;  For example, the built-infonts now include eight scaleable proportional typefaces using the CG Timesand Univers fonts, alongside 14 fixed-pitch bit-mapped Courier and LinePrinter fonts, with 16 symbol sets including Legal, Ventura, MicrosoftPublishing, and Windows sets alongside the usual Roman-8 and ECMA.andM;The scaleable fonts will be the most instantly attractive feature for manyusers, although there will be disappointment that only two rather clichedtypefaces have been built in, compared with the 13 or so typefaces inPostScript printers.andP;  The 'CG' prefix on one of the typefaces indicates thatthe fonts come from Agfa-Compugraphic and HP has, in fact, worked veryclosely with the typesetter manufacturer on the LaserJet III.andP;  TheCompugraphic Intellifont software is built in as the outline font'rasteriser', the necessary software that converts mathematical descriptionsof text characters into bit-mapped characters at 300dpi for the final pagelayout.andP;  And Compugraphic's library of more than 1,700 typefaces is instantlyavailable for use with the new printer.andM;On the other side of the equation, Compugraphic has developed typesettersbased on PCL rather than PostScript, and now that PCL 5 has outline fonttechnology it will be easier to sell PCL typesetters against the PostScriptequivalent.andP;  According to HP, Intellifont was chosen ahed of competingrasterisers and outline font standards because of its font rendering quality,its speed in translating outlines to bit-maps, and the compactness of itscode.andP;  This last feature is important because of the limited memory availablein the LaserJet III; although it has 1Mb as standard, only 720Kb is availableto users.andM;One important feature of the HP scaleable fonts is that they're supplied witha file containing data about scaling, kerning and matching fonts that can beused by software to implement these features.andP;  The file, called a Tagged FontMetric (TFM) file by analogy with the Adobe Font Metric (AFM) data ofPostScript fonts, has been included in recent HP bit-mapped and scaleablefont packages, labelled AutoFont Support.andP;  The Wordstar 6 review (pages 53 to54) gives more details of how one package, at least, uses TFM data to providekerning and font scaling.andM;The LaserJet III fonts can be scaled down to 0.25pt and up to 999.75pt inincrements of 0.25pt, and each of the built-in scaleable typefaces comes inRoman, bold, italic and bold italic to make up the eight available.andP;  Newfonts can be bought separately, complete with AutoFont TFM data, but must bedownloaded for use with HP's Type Director 2.0 package rather than byconventional means.andM;The other major technological change is Resolution Enhancement, which usesdirect control of the print engine to smooth jagged lines and give aneffective resolution higher than 300dpi.andM;To see how this works, consider how any laser printer produces its pages.andO;After the PDL's computer commands have produced a bit-mapped image in theprinter RAM, a photosensitive drum is electrostatically charged up in apattern that copies this page image on the drum surface.andP;  Fine black tonerpowder is then drawn to the charged image and sticks to those bits that areto appear black on the printed page; this toner image is then transferred topaper by the rotating drum, fixed by a heat process, and the printed page iscomplete.andP;  The print resolution is measured in dots per inch, so that a300dpi printer can actually print 90,000 black dots on a square inch ofpaper.andM;But these are normally fixed-size dots, unlike 'halftone' processes likethose used to print newspaper photographs.andP;  Shades of grey in a halftone arecreated by printing smaller dots in light areas and larger ones in darkareas, but normal laser printers use 'dithering' techniques.andP;  Here, theprinting area is divided into groups of dots and greys represented by fillingin different patterns of dots in each area.andP;  For example, if a laser printergroups its dots into four-by-four squares, then filling in different patternscan produce 16 shades of grey.andM;The problem is that dithering reduces the effective print resolution.andP;  For 16grey scales, there are only 75 groups of four-by-four dots per inchvertically and horizontally, and the effective resolution is therefore 75dpirather than 300dpi.andP;  But now, new PC add-in controller boards for laserprinters, such as Intel's Visual Edge and DP-Tek's LaserPort GreyScale, canproduce up to 256 shades of grey at full resolution on a Hewlett-PackardLaserJet II by driving the printer engine directly and varying the dot size.andO;And with Resolution Enhancement, HP has gone some way to building thatcontroller technology into the LaserJet III.andP;  Indeed, HP states that theIntel and DP-Tek boards are incompatible with Resolution Enhancement and thisfeature must be turned off if such a board is used.andM;What the Resolution Enhancement controller does is fill in the gaps along theedges of printed text and graphics, where jagged steps can be seen even at300dpi resolution, with variable-sized dots.andM;For example, say a printed character has a large, pointed serif; the LaserJetIII will fill in the very point of the serif with a tiny dot and add moresmall dots to fill in the character outline wherever necessary.andP;  It also usesvariable-sized dots to print grey-scale images, with results that are nearerhalf-tone than dithered monochrome.andP;  With this technique, HP claims that theeffective resolution of the printer is increased beyond 300dpi for both textand graphics, increasing the typesetting illusion.andM;Another improvement in the LaserJet III is a feature called Page Protectionthat prevents problems with very complex pages.andM;In some cases data can be lost and pages printed incorrectly because thepage's complexity has caused the page image creation process to fall behindthe print engine speed.andP;  Page Protection fixes this by reserving memory inthe printer and making sure that the whole image is safely built up in RAMbefore the print engine is started and paper fed.andP;  At least 2Mb of RAM mostbe installed in the LaserJet for this to work, but it can allow pages to beprinted that would otherwise be too complex.andM;The remaining changes fall into the 'possibly useful but not too exciting'category.andP;  Text in different orientations can be printed on a single page,although the possible rotation angle is fixed at 90 degrees and there areonly four orientations: Portrait, Landscape, Reverse Portrait and ReverseLandscape in PCL.andP;  But in HPGL mode scaleable typefaces can be rotated to anyangle just like PostScript ones.andM;In PCL 5 text can also be mirrored, slanted, printed in white on black, orprinted in patterns or shades of grey where the software supports it.andP;  thereare no other emulations built into the LaserJet III, but HP will be addingcartridges to provide PostScript, IBM Proprinter and Epson FX emulationslater this year.andP;  The HP Adobe Cartridge is due in May for all LaserJet IIand III family printers, while the IBM/Epson cartridge for the LaserJet IID,IIP and III is set to arrive in June.andM;Technologically speaking, the LaserJet III pack in most of what its userswere demanding.andP;  It has some things missing or skimped -- there aren't enoughbuilt-in outline fonts, and 1Mb of RAM isn't enough for a full page of 300dpigraphics--but there's enough there to keep users satisfied.andP;  If it's possibleto buy a LaserJet-compatible that can do most of what PostScript offers mostusers, has plotter support, and includes some neat resolution improvementtechniques, at LaserJet prices rather than PostScript prices, then manypeople will want to do just that.andM;With the price slotted in between the HP and the IID in the LaserJet range,and with the II suddenly disappearing from the family tree, it's clear thatthe LaserJet III will be HP's workhorse product for the general user.andP;  Andwhile it may not kill off PostScript and its other competitors, like theApple/Microsoft Royal rasteriser, the LaserJet III will be offering thosegeneral users a lot of features and build quality for their money.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
