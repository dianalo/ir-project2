Many GOP operatives and conservative activists hailed the events as a breakthrough that would enhance their power.    The GOPers, frozen out of the legislative process in many states, are excited at the prospect of playing a role in the drafting and passage of bills. Conservatives see the coalitions as a way of increasing their impact, too, since their agenda is usually furthered by Republican officeholders, and since coalitions, by their very nature, stress issues rather than merely party. Some conservatives regard coalitions as a way to bypass those party leaders more interested in maintaining their positions than in leading a cause.    But if coalitions offer the promise of political power and effective government, they don't always deliver. By blurring party differences, they contradict the national Republican strategy of sharpening differences between the parties. At the same time, they create an environment in the coalition states that is as likely to produce confusion as good government.    If they are going to become the majority in most states, as well as nationally, the Republicans must convince voters both that the parties are different and that it matters which party controls the levers of government. By participating in legislative coalitions, the GOP is conceding an important advantage to incumbents. With the Democrats holding 68 state legislative chambers to the Republicans' 29, that concession benefits the Democrats.    &quot;You need big issues, like crime, taxes and spending, breaking along party lines if you are going to beat entrenched incumbents,&quot; says Tom Shields, president of Marketing Resource Group, a Michigan-based GOP consulting firm, &quot;and coalition government makes that more difficult.&quot;    In helping Democratic state Rep. Richard Balducci to put together a coalition to become speaker of the Connecticut House, the Republicans ousted a Democrat who almost surely would have tried to get the Legislature to pass a state income tax. That issue is one of the most divisive in the state, and had deposed speaker Irving Stolberg succeeded in pushing the tax through the Legislature, the state's Democrats could have faced an electoral Dunkirk.    Participating in legislative coalitions also makes it difficult for Republicans to argue that the Democratic legislature is responsible for the state's problems. They have been co-opted. As North Carolina political scientist Thad Beyle wrote recently in the Comparative State Politics Newsletter, &quot;The Republicans {in the North Carolina House} can now be held accountable for their words and actions.&quot;    Unlike party switches, which suggest that party membership is important (since changing it is a big step) and that each party stands for certain principles and goals, legislative coalitions give the message that parties don't really matter.    &quot;Coalitions seem to make the party elites -- the legislators -- less partisan,&quot; says UCLA political scientist John Petrocik, a leading authority on voting behavior. &quot;And if you domesticate the opposing party, you automatically reduce the amount of partisan tension that the average voter feels.&quot; And less partisanship almost certainly means less party-line voting.    Proponents argue that legislative coalitions make state government more open and accountable, as autocratic leaders are deposed and replaced with more responsive and enlightened ones. Conservatives and Republicans also claim that the coalitions produce legislation more to their liking, and they point to past legislative coalitions in New Hampshire and New Mexico to make their point.    But the reverse is equally true: Coalitions can also produce legislatures dominated by personal bickering and back-biting, where ideology pales in comparison with personal vendettas and power plays. And they can give power to people unaccustomed to using it. In such cases, coalitions don't even produce good government. Legislative paralysis in Illinois and North Carolina exemplifies this.    State legislative coalitions are likely to continue popping up as larger trends alter the political landscape. But any expectation that they necessarily will promote better government is based more on hope than on the existing evidence.    ---   Mr. Rothenberg is director of the Free Congress Center for Government and Politics and editor of the Political Report. </TEXT></DOC>
