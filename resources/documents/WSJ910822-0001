The state Environmental Protection Agency beganenforcement actions against the 14 substances that could leadto suspension of sales of any products containing them. Amongthe substances are chemicals commonly sprayed on the state'shuge crops of cotton, almonds, alfalfa and oranges.Environmental groups said 535 products, including some usedby consumers to fight mosquitoes and moths, contain theingredients and may be banned from sale in the statebeginning early next year.</LP><TEXT>   The regulators' move was a boost to environmentalists, whohave been pushing for years for tougher control on farmchemical use in California. The action stemmed from pesticidemakers' failure to meet deadlines set in state laws passed in1984, which mandated comprehensive studies on potentialtoxicity of 200 chemicals commonly used in pesticides.   The state law, which like many California environmentallaws sought to be more restrictive than federal statutes,gave chemical makers until March 1 of this year to completethe studies.   At the deadline, however, chemical companies had completedstudies on only 48 of the substances, prompting charges offoot-dragging from environmentalists. Chemical makers havecomplained that the seven-year period since the law waspassed wasn't long enough to complete all the studies. As ofnow, state regulators said, studies of about 96 of thesubstances are still under way; many of the 200 substancesoriginally targeted aren't used in California anymore.</TEXT></DOC>
