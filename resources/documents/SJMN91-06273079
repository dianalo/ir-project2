Thatcher,who was called the &quot;Iron Lady&quot; by her critics (perhaps because she, along withRonald Reagan, defied and redefined modern politics by standing for principlesand forging policies from them), outlined an agenda President Bush can use toride to victory in next year's election.;   She didn't call it this, but Iwill. Thatcher is talking about building a new foundation.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Perspective  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  BUILDING A NEW BASE FOR CONSERVATISM  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Points of View; Cal Thomas is a syndicated columnist.  </MEMO><TEXT>     Thatcher called for a rebirth of conservatism. In the international arena,&quot;the practical case for democracy and capitalism is proven almost beyonddispute,&quot; she said. While President Bush will not be challenged on his masteryof international affairs, on domestic issues he may be more vulnerable.;  Here, Thatcher gave Bush the material he can use to run and to win -- and tobring more conservatives to Congress.;   &quot;The life of free men and women hasto be a life of self-discipline, self-control and -- for family and country --self-sacrifice.&quot; That one sentence takes care of the never-ending welfarestory, distributing condoms in public schools and a host of other challengesto the traditional moral order.;   &quot;The great economic advances whichcapitalism has made possible have allowed us to provide better welfare forthose who cannot cope for themselves. But in doing so it has led indirectly tothat very dependency culture which is weakening our countries and demoralizingthe poor,&quot; Thatcher said.;   Thatcher said (and Bush should, too) that &quot;whenwelfare benefits are paid to a considerable proportion of the population; whenthey are specifically directed at reducing the painful consequences ofprevious irresponsibility; when personal taxation strikes hard at those nearthe bottom of the income scale; and when, more generally, traditionalstandards are under attack -- in these circumstances the very foundations ofour society are put at risk.&quot;;   That is the correct response to Democraticpresidential candidate Tom Harkin's attacks on President Bush for ignoring thepoor and homeless. That is the rebuff to so-called &quot;moderate&quot; Republicans whowant to emulate Democrats in their worn-out economic policies.;   What acontrast to California Gov. Pete Wilson, whose government by accommodation andnegotiation may yet wreck his state's Republican Party if new taxes andspending don't wreck it first. Anyone who thinks the Wilson approach togoverning is superior to the Reagan-Bush should try naming the last modernRepublican president who ran and won on proposals to raise taxes and spend themoney on more programs.;   Thatcher said in her speech, &quot;The world is giving(America) a mandate for leadership.&quot; That leadership ought to extend to thehome front, as well as to the afterglow of new-found freedom in much of theworld.;   President Bush should build on this new foundation and bury thefailed liberal policies that are bankrupting our society.
