The 104 percent increase in prison or jail sentences caused theoverall number of incarcerations to increase 28 percent, the studysaid.   The department's Bureau of Justice Statistics looked at arrests,prosecutions and convictions in California, Minnesota, New York,Pennsylvania and Virginia. The proportion of convicted defendantsimprisoned or jailed increased for each category of offense:violent crimes, property crimes, drug crimes and public-ordercrimes.   According to the report, 62 percent of the 1.9 million peoplearrested during that period were convicted. Thirty-nine percent ofthe people arrested went on to jail or prison.   Of those convicted, 67 percent went on to state or local jails,15 percent were fined, and 18 percent received probation.   An arrest was not recorded for purposes of the study until thecase was disposed of with either a verdict or a decision not toprosecute.   Arrests for drug offenses increased 52 percent, prosecutionsrose 61 percent and convictions for those crimes went up 71 percentduring the four-year period, said the report from the bureau'sOffender Based Transaction Statistics Program.   The study said 74 percent of all convicted drug offendersreceived a jail or prison term during the period, compared with 67percent of those convicted of violent crimes.   The percentage of arrested drug offenders who were incarceratedupon conviction increased from 71 percent in 1983 to 83 percent by1986.   The proportion of drug offenders who did not receive a prison orjail term after conviction dropped from 29 percent in 1983 to 17percent in 1986.   Drug arrests increased from 68,447 in 1983 to 103,826 in 1986while prosecutions for those crimes went from 50,918 to 81,992during the period, the study said.   The study found that 1.1 million of people arrested for allcrimes during the period were convicted. Forty-six percent of thosearrested were charged with a property crime, while 24 percent wereaccused of a violent offense.   Sixteen percent were arrested on drug charges and 13 percent onpublic-order offenses.   Ninety percent of those arrested for violent crimes were men.   Women accounted for 15 percent of drug arrests and 17 percent ofarrests for property crimes.   The statistics were collected from the participating states,which collected fingerprint cards and disposition records.   People who were arrested on drug crimes were also more likely tobe imprisoned if convicted. Additional states are expected toparticipate over the next few years, the department said.   The study did not provide a state-by-state breakdown of thefigures collected from the five states.</TEXT></DOC>
