(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Two women have filed lawsuits accusingtheir former doctor of impregnating them during romantic liaisons,then performing abortions without their knowledge. One said she hadbeen eight months pregnant.   Robert W. York, an attorney who represents the women suing Dr.Pravin D. Thakkar, said Tuesday his clients seek unspecified damagesfor the loss of the fetuses and for emotional harm.   ``I can't imagine what it would be like to be a mother and havesomething growing inside you that you wanted and to have it takenfrom you in the way that it was,'' York said. ``I think it's beenvery hard for both of them to handle and to deal with.''   Carmen Brutchen Hertzinger of Anderson filed her lawsuit lastweek against Thakkar in Madison Circuit Court. Kathy Collins ofMadison County said in her Nov. 4 lawsuit that the abortion wasperformed in her second or third month of pregnancy.   Thakkar, an obstetrician-gynecologist, denied the allegations.   ``All I can say is the facts in the matter will not stand up tothese allegations,'' he said.   Hertzinger said she became Thakkar's patient in October 1982. Onher first visit to his office in nearby Frankton, about 30 milesnortheast of Indianapolis, Thakkar suggested they see each othersocially and Hertzinger accepted, according to the lawsuit.   Hertzinger said she became pregnant with Thakkar's child inFebruary 1983. Thakkar is accused of administering drugs toHertzinger, causing her to deliver the fetus in his home eightmonths later. He told her the baby was stillborn and he had takencare of it, Hertzinger said.   However, Hertzinger said Tuesday that she was conscious duringpart of the procedure and heard a baby's cry.   ``There were many times of unconsciousness but this was a timethat I was very conscious and there's something about a baby's crythat you don't forget,'' she told WISH-TV in Indianapolis.   Thakkar's attorney, Michael Lacey, said he was told Hertzinger'sinfant was stillborn at a hospital.   WISH-TV reported that although state law would require a deathcertificate for a stillbirth, none was filed with the Madison CountyHealth Department during that time.   Collins claims Thakkar fathered her unborn child and that heaborted the fetus with a medical instrument during an examinationJan. 9, 1988.   During the examination, Collins said Tuesday, Thakkar told hershe was not carrying a child.   ``I breathed a sigh of relief, and I felt an excruciating painthat sent me to the top of the examining table,'' she said. ``I feltthe instrument dragging on the examining table. I told him to takeit out.''   Thakkar again manipulated the instrument, causing more pain, shesaid.   ``At that point, I just rolled off the top of the examiningtable. The instrument fell out, and I went to the bathroom,'' shesaid.   Thakkar denied Collins' claims, but did say he had an on-again,off-again relationship with her at one time.   His said the Indiana attorney general's office was investigatingThakkar as a result of the complaints.   Madison Circuit Judge Fredrick Spencer signed a temporaryrestraining order against Thakkar last week preventing him fromattempting to sell, transfer or dispose of his assets pending ahearing Monday.   The order came after York filed a petition to set up areceivership for Thakkar's assets, claiming the doctor advertised tosell real estate in Madison County after Collins filed her complaint.</TEXT></DOC>
