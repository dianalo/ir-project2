The fighting in Natal Province has pitted supporters of militantanti-apartheid organizations against members of Inkatha, a moreconservative group headed by prominent Zulu leader MangosuthuButhelezi.   Inkatha's secretary general, Oscar Dhlomo, and Jay Naidoo,secretary general of the militant Congress of South African TradeUnions, signed the agreement at a courthouse in the provincialcapital, Pietermaritzburg.   The labor federation, known as COSATU, has been allied with theUnited Democratic Front, a now-banned anti-apartheid coalition, inthe feud against Inkatha.   The agreement condemns violence and calls for formation of aconciliation board which would review residents' complaints ofharassment or attacks. The board's members would be selectedjointly by the two sides and have disciplinary powers.   As part of the agreement, each side will drop pending courtcases accusing the other of violence.   ``Each party recognizes the immediate necessity to make itabundantly clear to its members that COASTU and Inkathacategorically condemn acts of intimidation, forced recruitment andviolence,'' the agreement says.   ``All political organizations have the right to exist and thedemocratic right to espouse their own particular viewpoint,'' itsays.   Most of the fighting has been in the black townships aroundPietermaritzburg but has spread in recent months to townships nearthe larger port city of Durban. Many of the killings have been toavenge earlier killings.   Both Inkatha, which claims 1.5 million members, and the UnitedDemocratic Front-COSATU alliance oppose the apartheid policieswhich enable South Africa's 5 million whites to dominate 26 millionblacks. But their strategies differ markedly.   The front, a predominantly black coalition of about 600 groups,advocates economic sanctions, strikes and other confrontationalmeasures to bring about sweeping political and economic change.Inkatha opposes sanctions, avoids militant protest and advocatescapitalism.   Many militants view Buthelezi as a government collaboratorbecause he is chief minister of the KwaZulu homeland. However,Buthelezi has rejected invitations by the government to join innegotiating reforms that would expand blacks' political role whileleaving whites in ultimate control.   Peter Kerschoff, a social worker in Pietermaritzburg who hasbeen involved in past reconciliation efforts, said the agreementwas an important but not final step toward ending the conflict.   Because of government bans and restrictions ``it is extremelydifficult for COSATU and the UDF to communicate with grassrootspeople. This will have to be addressed,'' he said in a telephoneinterview.   The Natal violence has distressed other anti-apartheidcampaigners and caused debate over whether black political groupscould avoid factional fights and effectively oppose the white-ledgovernment.   Some commentators viewed the conflict as a harbinger ofwidespread black infighting that might develop as black groups withdifferent ideologies struggled for supremacy.</TEXT></DOC>
