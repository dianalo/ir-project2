Mr. President, the Federation of American Scientists havecontributed greatly to public and congressional understanding of the possibilitiesand limitations of arms control. Earlier this year they published a monographon ``the Future of Conventional Arms Control in Europe.'' <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>There can be no doubt about where these scientistsfor peace are coming from. Here is a preeminent peace advocacy organization.They have been right out in front in supporting every realistic arms controlproposal since virtually the dawn of the nuclear age. But in this latest10,000-word analysis of the outlook for conventional arms control in Europe,they come up with what this Senator regards as a painfully pessimisticconclusion. Pessimistic but realistic. Oh, the monograph concludes with:[S11MY8-19]{S5421}<ITAG tagnum="21">With time and patience, the logjam can be broken and a new era ofstability in Europe achieved.</ITAG>But a close reading of this analysis by such preeminent arms control advocatessuggests that the time of achievement could be decades and the necessarypatience infinite. It is not hard to understand the mutual intra<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>n<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>sigence. Gorbachev speaks of asymetrical reductions.Sounds very promising<CODE-213>5</CODE-213> <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>doesn't it? Obviously with Warsaw Pact forces armedwith at least three times as many tanks as the NATO forces, at least twice<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>as <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>much artillery, far more planes and a massive advantagein the number of troops, one would logically assume that the <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>pact<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> is ready to make a significantly disproportionatereduction in weapons and military personnel. Unfortunately there is noevidence that the <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>pact<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> has really changed at all its assertion in the BudapestAppeal of June 1986 that land forces and air forces of both military alliancesin Europe should be reduced by some 25 percent as compared with presentlevels. Such a<CODE-213>5</CODE-213> <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>reduction would obviously be completely unacceptablefor NATO.A year ago_April 10, 1987, in Prague, Gorbachev said the pact favored reachinga balance of forces on both sides ``not through a buildup of those whoare behind but through reduction on the part of those who are ahead.''Hooray. This sounds like hats-in-the-air time. But in the year that haselapsed what have the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact done? It seems thosewho were so excited by Gorbachev's Prague assertion overlooked the spinhe was putting on this sentence: ``We see the process of reduc<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ing<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> military confrontation in Europe as a phased process,observing balan<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>c<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>e at each stage at the level of reasonable sufficie<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>n<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>cy.'' So the Soviets will reduce their milit<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>a<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ry forces but only to a level of ``reasonable sufficiency.''The American Federation of Scientists article contends that the Sovietmilitary substitutes ``defense sufficie<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>n<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>cy'' for ``reasonable sufficie<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>n<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>cy.'' To the military that, of course, means higherdefense requirements. An<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>d<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> in July 1987, Soviet Defense Minister Yazov said,``It is not we who set the limits of sufficie<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>n<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>cy, it is the actions of the United States and NATO.''Mr. President, let's face it we are dealing with a power in the SovietUnion that Secretary Gorbachev whether he likes it or not almost certainlycannot control. Mr. Gorbachev is having serious trouble right now witha Soviet economy that is stumbling and staggering. His Perestroika hasalienated many of the powerful Politburo bureaucrats as he attempts todecentralize control over pricing and production in 80 percent o<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>f <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>the Soviet economy. He can't afford to kick his militaryaround at the same time. Now what happens to the power of that militaryif and when arms control negotiations mean they lose half their artillery,two-thirds of their tanks, and a massive sh<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>a<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>re of their troops to command? Obviously, their worldcollapses around them. So the Soviet military bureaucracy becomes alienatedat the same time Gorbachev is running smack into very similar civilianbureaucratic resistance. Civilian bureaucrats are stalling <ITAG tagnum="80">Gorbachev's efforts to decentralize its dinosaur of a centralizedeconomy. For Gorbachev to take on his military and his civilian bureaucracyat one and the same time with a double reorganization that could seriouslydamage both may very well mean that he will lose on both fronts. </ITAG>Here is why the United States and NATO should push the Kremlin loud andlong for conventional arms control reductions and big ones. So why don'twe do exactly that? Here's why: We have our own military industrial complexthat will resist cutbacks that will cost our own admirals and generalstheir jobs and will slash the production and profits from powerful militarycontractors. So arms control at the conventional level where it will bearfar and away its biggest economic fruits goes little farther than the rhetoricalflourishes and public relations pitches calcaluated to win approval fromthe vast majority of the world's people who yearn for peace. How ironic this is, at a time when the surest and wisest way the UnitedStates and the Soviet Union can overcome each of their serious economicproblems is through a negotiated, mutual and thoroughly verified agreementto stop the conventional arms race and save billions. How specially ironicthis is in a world in which the massive arms both sides are working sofeverishly to build can only be used in a superpower war in an act of certaindouble suicide_that would bring the death_the final end for both nationsas organized societies.

Mr. President, today I want to sing the praises of the Societyfor the Preservation and Encouragement of Barber Shop Quartet Singing inAmerica, Inc._S.P.E.B.S.Q.S.A., Inc. This Wisconsin-based organizationis celebrating 50 years of spreading goodwill through song. The S.P.E.B.S.Q.S.A. has more than 800 chapters nationwide, and affiliatesin Canada, Great Britain, Sweden, and New Zealand. The<CODE-213>5</CODE-213> <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>Barbershoppers number almost 40,000 men dedicatedto the preservation of this American art form. Two women's groups, SweetAdelines and Harmony, Inc., bring the total number of participants to about75,000.S.P.E.B.S.Q.S.A. was formed in 1938 by two Tulsa businessmen, O.C. Cashand Rupert Hall. The name was a takeoff on the ``alphabet agencies'' ofthe New <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>D<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>eal era. It is as accurate as it is amusing_the S.P.E.B.S.Q.S.A.has preserved and encouraged a literature and a style of music with a richtradition of American life. This tradition predates television, the computerage, and the hustle and bustle of much of today's recreational life. The dedication of the 75,000 men and women in this organization goes farbeyond simple fellowship and fun. They contribute to the enrichment ofthe lives of many in their communities. Through singing they have helpedto raise millions of dollars for civic, charitable, and patriotic purposes.The men, for instance, contribute substantially to the Institute of Logopedics,a research and service agency for persons with speech impediments and multiplehandicaps. The Barbershoppers' commitment to quality performance is exemplary. Theycarry on extensive educational programs to improve their singing. As amateurs,their best quartets are on par with professional groups and universityperformers anywhere. Last December, the Alexandria Harmonizers from Alexandria,VA, performed in the Kennedy Center Honors Program for the President, Membersof Congress, and millions of Americans. Mr. President, all of America is proud to honor the Barbershoppers on theirgolden anniversary. They enter upon their 51st year with the warm wishesand congratulations of Americans everywhere.

Mr. President, I hope my friends on the ArmedServices Committee will give me very careful attention. I say that notbecause they would not ordinarily give careful attention, but because thisis a new and important initiative which was not brought up, and I apologizefor that, before the Armed Services Committee, because we were trying tosolve this problem in another arena, mainly on the Appropriations Committee,but I hope and I think it will have a strong appeal particularly to mydear friend who is the <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>manager <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>of the bill at this point, Senator <T4>Exon</T4>, from Nebraska. Mr. President, what the amendment does is to provide that $700 millionpresently available for the SDI program shall be available only to reimburseNASA as DOD's share of the cost to support production including ancillarynetwork communications and flight data systems to return the space transportationsystem to flight status and sustain near-term launch rates.What that means in plain language, Mr. President, is that we take $700million from SDI and dedicate it to NASA for the shuttle and in effectto make possible the space station.Now, the first question is, Mr. President, is it necessary to do this?Mr. President, for the last few weeks in the Appropriations Committee wehave been dealing with this terrible number crunch brought on by the economicsummit of last year. My colleague<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>s<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> will recall that in the economic summit of lastyear we provided for ceilings in national defense which essentially providedfor a 3<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>-<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>percent growth. We provided that with respect todiscretionary nondefense, which are most of the other functions of Government,there was a target of a 2<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>-<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>percent<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>-<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>nominal increase. Because of spendout rates and rescoring,that has been increased to about a 3<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>-<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>percent<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>-<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>nominal rate under the economic summit. However,on the discretionary nondefense, we have less than inflation. To put itanother way, there are $4.8 billion of new dollars in discretionary nondefenseto cover about $17<CODE-213>5</CODE-213> <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>billion-plus of new initiatives by the Presidentand others.Now, the new initiatives by the President and others are very high priority.They are drug interdiction, airport safety, waste water treatment, thespace station, the super collider, new initiatives on AIDS research, newinitiatives by the National Science Foundation. There are a plethora ofnew initiatives which simply cannot be provided for with available money.One of those with which we are having great difficulty_some would say animpossibility of providing money for, although I am dedicated to tryingto do it_is the space station.In effect, this $700 million would give us the money for NASA. This doesnot specify that it goes for the space station. But it would free up othermoney in the NASA budget to build a space station. So the question whichthis amendment poses is, what is the higher priority in our spending, tobuild a space station or to have a $700 million increase in SDI?The committee's budget provides a $700 million increase_I think it is $67.5million, but I will round it to $700 million_to have that $700 millionspent within the four corners of space-based kinetic kill vehicles andother things, or whether we should spend that on another Department ofDefense initiative, which is NASA and space.Mr. President, the first question is, <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>I<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>s a space station a high priority? I think this bodyhas answered that question time and time again.Last year we had an extensive debate here on the question of the spacestation. That debate, as I recall, lasted about 5 hours, and I was tryingto recall what the count was. It seems to me it was in the neighborhoodof <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>4 <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>or <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>5 <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>to <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>1<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>. Senators said, yes, let us build a space station.I will not try to repeat all of those a<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>rg<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>uments, Mr. President, because the arguments weremade and as indicated by that debate are well known by the Senators. Iwould invite my colleagues' attention to the May 18 issue <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>of<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> U.S. News andamp; World Report entitled ``SovietsIn Space.'' That is the lead article. It goes on to point out what we allknow to be a fact; that is, that the Soviets are making huge advances inspace, more launches, they have a space station. As the article says: [S11MY8-75]{S5424}<ITAG tagnum="21">By launching frequently and reliably the Soviet Union has shown itcan generate and support a broad range of space programs from highly publicizedmanned flights to secret spy satellites. </ITAG>So, Mr. President, I will not dwell on that question of what is the priorityof the space station. That question has been answered by the Senate. Itis being answered every day by Soviet strides, Soviet excellence in space,Soviet ability to not only launch but to maintain a space station whichorbits as we speak in the heavens. Question No. 2, Mr. President: Is this a legitimate expense of the Departmentof Defense? I think this is an essential question. First, because underthe summit agreement, we set limits on defense spending and discretionarynondefense; second, because, from the standpoint of the Budget Act if itis not a legitimate defense expenditure, it would be a transfer and perhapssubject to a point of order; third, we simply, at least from my standpoint,do not want to turn a defense expenditure into a domestic expenditure ifit is not legitimate.So I think we ought to face up to that question of: Is this a legitimatedefense expenditure? First, from the standpoint of scoring, I am advised that this scores asa de<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>f<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ense expenditure. It does not constitute a transferfrom defense to nondefense. That is from the technical standpoint becausethe technical standpoint is quite important. Second, from the standpointof is it a legitimate defense expenditure, I think the facts support thatoverwhelmingly. In 1986, for example, the Senate Armed Services Committeesupported the payment for the fourth orbiter. The report accompanying that defense appropriation bill for fiscal 1987states on page 344 as follows: [S11MY8-76]{S5424}<ITAG tagnum="21">The Department of Defense testified<CODE-213>5</CODE-213> <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>*<CODE-213>5</CODE-213> <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>*<CODE-213>5</CODE-213> <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>*<CODE-213>5</CODE-213> <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>the severe impact the shuttle loss has on defensepayloads and strongly supported the procurement of a replacement orbiterfor national security requirements. The Department noted that, for nationalsecurity missions, loss of the Challenger meant that only two of the threeremaining orbiters were fully capable since the third NASA orbiter is notconfigured to provide the capacity for heavier defense loads. </ITAG>And they conclude, continuing the quote: [S11MY8-77]{S5424}<ITAG tagnum="21">The committee's recommendation to fund the replacement orbiter inthis bill recognizes critical dependence on the space shuttle system tomeet national security mission demands and balance launch system requirements.</ITAG>I could not say it any better, or the committee could not be any more correct.National defense requirements depend upon the shuttle which we fund inthis amendment. Why $700 million, and why do we transfer that figure? Mr. President, thatfigure is derived from what we see or what has been stated as the Departmentof Defense percentage of the shuttle cost. It has been noted that therewill be 52 flights for the shuttle through 1993. Of those 52 flights, 13are dedicated to the Department of Defense, and two are partial DOD flights,or 29 percent are dedicated to the DOD. In fiscal year 1989, the DOD useof the shuttle is even more intensive than that 2<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>9<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> percent. Of the seven shuttle flights, three are DOD dedicated and one is partiallyDOD dedicated. However, we have used the lower figure, that is, the 29<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>-<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>percent figure. Twenty-nine percent of what? In thebudget of NASA presently pending, there is an increase for space shuttleproduction and operation capability of $1.4 billion, space and ground networksincrease of $1.035 billion, for a total of $2.43 billion new initiativesin the NASA budget this year. So if you take 29 percent of that $2.43 billion,it comes out to be $700 million, which is the amount transferred by thisbill.So to repeat, this is a legitimate DOD expenditure. It has been so statedby no lesser authority than the Senate Armed Services Committee. The amountand the percentage are precisely and exactly consistent with the DOD needs.Question No. 2, I believe, is answered and overwhelmingly so. It is a legitimateDOD expense, so stated by the committee, so scored by the Parliamentarian,by the Budget Committee, and by the Committee on the Budget.The third question: What is the higher priority between the SDI increasesand the space station? <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>T<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>hat is to say, you have a $700 million increase inthe SDI budget, and the 29 percent DOD share of the NASA budget increasewould be also $700 million.What is the higher priority? Can you do them both?First of all, Mr. President, it would be very difficult to do them both.The NASA budget is contained in the HUD and independent agencies budget,and that is not only one of the most popular budgets in terms of additionalspending initiatives, but also, it is, by most any standard, one of themost needed budgets in terms of increases.If you look at the major program increases in just the President's budgetin NASA, you have the $2.6 billion increase in NASA which I just alludedto. You have the EPA <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>S<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>uperfund increase_that is the hazardous waste increase_of$472 million. National Science Foundation is $333 million. What is a higherpriority today than National Science Foundation, to try to get this countryback into the competition for high technology and for excellence in science?What can be a higher priority than that?Veterans medical care: $230 million. Not only is that greatly needed, butals<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>o<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>, it is very popular in the Senate.So when you try to balance those new initiatives by <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>t<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>he President against a $2.6 billion increase in NASA,it is going to be very difficult to stretch those dollars. The Presidentdid it. How did he do it in HUD and independent agencies? By cutting assistedhousing $850 million; by cutting was<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>t<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>e treatment construction grants by $804 million;by cutting community development programs by $616 million; by cutting elderlyhousing by $200 million; by cutting homeless programs by $119 million.Mr. President, we could debate those programs for weeks, as to which havethe higher priorities and which do not have the higher priorities.We have debated homeless for days. Do you know how the Senate comes outfor homeless? We are for the homeless. We are not for cutting it. It isalmost silly to suggest that not only the Senate but also Congress wouldcut $119 million from the <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>H<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>omeless <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>P<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>rogram or is going to cut the <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>W<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>aste <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>W<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ater <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>T<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>reatment <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>P<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>rogram by $472 million, or assisted housing by $850million, or elderly housing by $200 million, in order to fund the spacestation. I think we could agree and stipulate to that. That is true. Itis not arguable.That is what we came up against in the Appropriations Committee. As I say,we have in the broad category of discretionary nondefense $4.8 billionto cover over $17 billion of these new initiatives, and one of the newinitiatives is the space station. Another of the new initiatives is a neworbiter. Another is a whole range of new requirements in the NASA budget.If I may point out some of these things in the NASA budget, in additionto the space station itself_and it appears that the minimum amount forthe space station this year, I am advised by Dr. Fletcher, is about $800million. But, in addition to that, there is a requirement of $313 millionfor shuttle recovery efforts, $400 million for shuttle operations, $168million for expendable launch vehicles, $151 million for space and groundcommunications and data networks. The list goes on. So, the picture I am trying to paint_and I hope I am not overwhelming mycolleagues with numbers_but, if I can lay it out as simply as I can, itis going to be very difficult to find money for the space station or evento keep the rest of the NASA program going unless we can justify moneyout of this DOD budget. (Mr. BREAUX assumed the chair.)[S11MY8-78]{S5425}WARNERMr. WARNER. Mr. President, will the Senator at some point entertain a questionon the budget aspects of this?[S11MY8-79]{S5425}JOHNSTONMr. JOHNS<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>T<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ON. Yes. [S11MY8-80]{S5425}WARNERMr. WARNER. The Senator is fully aware that in the latter part of lastyear, December, there was a deadlock between the legislative branch andthe executive branch over budget figures. We came to the famous budgetsummit, and figures were allocated. Defense was given $299.5 million. Inour report to the Senate, we st<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>at<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ed that the summit between the President and Congresslast November resulted in an agreement that national defense spending forfiscal year 1989 would be $299.5 million, and the committee meets the budgetauthority. In other words, our committee operated, as my distinguished colleague fromNebraska, I am sure, will confirm, within the confines of that budget summit.This is going to break that apart.I ask my good friend: What incentive is there for the President and Congressto try again and have a summit and make these tough decisions on budgetallocations if we are going to take large sums such as this away from thatagreement?[S11MY8-81]{S5425}JOHNSTONMr. JOHNS<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>T<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ON. I thank my colleague for his question. I thinkperhaps he did not hear the early part of my__[S11MY8-82]{S5425}WARNERMr. WARNER. I have listened to everything, Mr. President. I may have missedthe early part of it, and maybe it ought to be reviewed. [S11MY8-83]{S5425}JOHNSTONMr. JOHN<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>STO<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>N. I thank the Senator for his question, and thatis the central question, and that is what I started my speech with. I was a member of that budget summit. [S11MY8-84]{S5425}WARNERMr. WARNER. That is my recollection. [S11MY8-85]{S5425}JOHNSTONMr. JOHN<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>STO<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>N. And I strongly supported it. What I am going is taking 29 percent of the space shuttle expenditures,which happens to be the exact percentage that is a DOD requirement__[S11MY8-86]{S5425}WARNERMr. WARNER. For what fiscal year?[S11MY8-87]{S5425}JOHNSTONMr. JOHN<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>STO<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>N. Through fiscal year 1993. In other words, thereare 52 launches to be done between now and 1993, and 13 are dedicated toDOD and <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>2 <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>are partially DOD flights, or 29 percent. [S11MY8-88]{S5425}WARNERMr. WARNER. Mr. President, I am going to try to refine those facts, becausemy indication, preliminarily, is that because of the lack of availability,DOD is virtually off the shuttle in 1992.[S11MY8-89]{S5425}JOHNSTONMr. JOHN<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>STO<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>N. Except for SDI.[S11MY8-90]{S5425}WARNERMr. WARNER. I want to go back to the principle. What is the incentive forus ever to sit down and have another summ<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>it<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> if we are going to sit here and take it apart?[S11MY8-91]{S5425}JOHNSTONMr. JOHN<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>STO<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>N. Because we are not taking this out of defense.[S11MY8-92]{S5425}WARNERMr. WARNER. I understand. [S11MY8-93]{S5425}JOHNSTONMr. JOHN<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>STO<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>N. In fiscal year 1987_I ask my colleague to listento this_the committee said this:[S11MY8-94]{S5425}<ITAG tagnum="21">The committee recommendation to fund the replacement orbiter in thisbill recognizes the critical dependence on the space shuttle system tomeet national security mission demands and balance launch system requirements.</ITAG>Will the Senator tell me what was meant by that?[S11MY8-95]{S5425}WARNERMr. WARNER. Mr. President, I yield to my distinguished colleague from Nebraska,who is a member of the Budget Committee, to join in this debate, becauseI think he takes the same position I do.[S11MY8-96]{S5425}EXONMr. EXON. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?JOHNSTON. Yes. But, first, all one Senator or the other tell me what theircommittee meant in its report when it said:[S11MY8-97]{S5425}<ITAG tagnum="21">The committee's recommendation to fund the replacement orbiter inthis bill recognizes the critical dependence on the space shuttle systemto meet national security mission demands and balance launch system requirements.</ITAG>[S11MY8-98]{S5425}WARNERMr. WARNER.

That is, I think, the Appropriations Committee bill.[S11MY8-100]{S5425}WARNERMr. WARNER. It is not our bill.[S11MY8-101]{S5425}JOHNSTONMr. JOHNSTON. It is the Department of Defense appropriation bill.[S11MY8-102]{S5425}WARNERMr. WARNER. It is not our bill.[S11MY8-103]{S5425}EXONMr. EXON. The Senator was alluding to the fact time and time again. Itis not what we said in the Armed Services Committee, I assure my friendand colle<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>a<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>gue from Louisiana. That is not the case.What he is doing is taking material from the committee on which he servesand using it as an argument that it is a position of the Armed ServicesCommittee which is definitely not the case. I think we should get thatstraight.[S11MY8-104]{S5426}JOHNSTONMr. JOHNSTON. I apologize to my colleagues. Frankly, in reading it quickly,it is clearly the Appropriations Committee bill.[S11MY8-105]{S5426}WARNERMr. WARNER. I think the Senator is now referring to a document which isnot our bill.[S11MY8-106]{S5426}JOHNSTONMr. JOHNSTON. Do the floor managers think that that conclusion is nor correct?[S11MY8-107]{S5426}WARNERMr. WARNER. Mr. President, I have not had the opportunity to examine theconclusion in some de<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ta<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>il. I am not prepared to give an answer to that.My point in standing up and interrupting my distinguished friend from Louisianais simply to say what significance does he attach to these summit agreementsand what is the incentive in the future for ever trying to reach another?Why should the Secretary of Defense in the future try to take the dramaticcuts he accepted if he felt that in subsequent debate in the Sen<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>a<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>te and elsewhere the Congress these large cuts wouldcome.[S11MY8-108]{S5426}JOHNSTONMr. JOHNSTON. The first conclusion is that 29 percent is the precise amountof payloads which are DOD dedicated. Now, if these are not <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>D<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>OD dedicated, if there is no connection, if the appropriationsbill and the Appropriations Committee was incorrect in saying that thereis this vital connectivity between the shuttle and the Department of Defensethen, of course, the Senator is correct.If we were sending this out to buy lollipops or pay for food stamps, yes,sure. But this is to pay the Department of Defense's share of shuttle operations,exactly, not a dollar more, exactly $700 million.[S11MY8-109]{S5426}WARNERMr. WARNER. Mr. President, I will eventually get this information. My understandingis that DOD has already prepared those bills in the future.<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>[S11MY8-110]<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>{S5426}<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>EXONMr. EXON. To correct the record, we have paid for 9 of the 15 in advancethat NASA already owes us, and that is one of the arguments I intend tomake.[S11MY8-111]<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>{S5426}<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>WARNERMr. WARNER. That goes to the 29 percent that the Senator keeps raising.[S11MY8-112]<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>{S5426}<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>JOHNSTONMr. JOHNSTON. I am advised those are user fees that DOD is not paying anyof the recovery costs and that is what we are talking about in this question.But you know the rationale of the 29 percent_I mean<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>, I think we have to recognize that the Departmentof Defense ha<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>s<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> some payloads, do we not? Is there not an interestin the Department of Defense in the shuttle program? Is that not absolutelytrue? If it is not true, let us decide that. But it seems to me that thatis very clear. It may not have been the Senate Armed Services Committeebut it was the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee when Senator <T4>Stevens</T4> was the chairman of that, which said that there was avery clear connection and they were going to pay for the fourth orbiteron that account.I do not understand what the argument about it is. Is the Senator honestlysaying that there is not a military DOD interest in the shuttle?[S11MY8-113]{S5426}EXONMr. EXON. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, I was trying to givethe Senator an opportunity to present his case and then I had the rebuttalprepared to answer his question. The Armed Services Committee has heldextensive hearings on this matter. We are not prepared in the Armed ServicesCommittee to put all of our eggs in one basket which is essentially beingsuggested here by the Senator from Louisiana with regard to more and moremoney on the shuttle.The facts of the matter are that the Department of Defense has alreadypaid for the equivalent of <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>9<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> of the 15 shuttle operations that we felt we neededfor national defense, and we have not gotten any of them. We have alreadypaid in advance.To clarify this situation, I would like to read from the Armed ServicesCommittee report in this regard after several lengthy hearings on the matter,and the report says on page 36:[S11MY8-114]{S5426}<ITAG tagnum="21">The Committee supported last year and continues to support the developmentof redundant space launch capability so that the United States will neveragain * * *</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">never again, Mr. President_</ITAG>[S11MY8-115]{S5426}be depende<ITAG tagnum="20">be dependent for space access on a single vehicle type.</ITAG>I think we have learned our lesson.[S11MY8-116]{S5426}<ITAG tagnum="21">The space launch recovery efforts will result in a number of expendablelaunch vehicles ensuring * * *</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">ensuring_</ITAG>[S11MY8-117]{S5426}that the f<ITAG tagnum="20">that the failure of a single booster type will not ground all thesatellite programs.</ITAG>More editorial comment.[S11MY8-118]{S5426}JOHNSTONMr. JOHNSTON. Is the Senator answering the question? I want to be sureI retain my right to the floor.[S11MY8-119]{S5426}EXONMr. EXON. I will yield back to my friend. He asked a question and I wastrying to answer. I will yield back and save the remainder of my rebuttaluntil after he finishes.[S11MY8-120]{S5426}JOHNSTONMr. JOHNSTON. I did want to have the give and take because I would rathernot go into this as a confrontation but as reasonable men thinking together.It seems to me it is so clear that there is a defense DOD Armed ServicesCommittee interest in the shuttle and in the space station.You can argue about whether it has been paid for and our mathematics excludesthe user fees that have already been paid by the Department of Defense.Those have been excluded in our 29 percent calculation.[S11MY8-121]{S5426}EXONMr. EXON. But why?[S11MY8-122]{S5426}JOHNSTONMr. JOHNSTON. Because you have already paid for it. This is the part.[S11MY8-123]{S5426}EXONMr. EXON. We have not gotten services rendered that we paid for. That isthe point.The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana has the floor.[S11MY8-124]{S5426}JOHNSTONMr. JOHNSTON. This is to fix the problems with the shuttle because of <T3>Challenger.</T3> That is where the additional $700 million comes from.But, look, if the Department of Defense is going to take the attitude thatanytime you pay for something and something breaks and you have to payadditional that you are not going to pay the additional because you alreadypaid for it, then there are a whole host of weapons programs, includingthe B-1 and a lot of others that you never fix when they are broken.These are what you might call fixing costs; $700 million is the 29-percentshare of DOD plus after 1992, as your report says, quoting from page 37,and this is the defense authorization report:[S11MY8-125]{S5426}<ITAG tagnum="21">The current shuttle manifest to DOD shows only strategic defense initiativeand research and development-related flights with the unique manned requirementsafter 1992.</ITAG>So after 1992, there are SDI needs.So, Mr. President, we have tried to do the mathematics correctly to reflectthe DOD percentage of the cost in the shuttle, and I think the mathematicsare correct and I think logic is correct.The next question is what is the higher priority between the SDI increasesand the space station. That I think is sort of the ultimate question here.There are scarce dollars to go around. You cannot do everything, as I pointedout. It is very arguable that when you get to competition and in the HUDand Ind<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>e<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>pendent Agencies Subcommittee of the AppropriationsCommittee there is not going to be enough money to do the space stationwithout this, and I went through the list, assist housing, waste treatmentgrants, community development block grants, elderly housing, the homelessprogram, EPA, Superfund, National Science Foundation, veterans medicalcare.Mr. President, if you do not get some extra money, I will not say you cankiss the space staton goodbye, because I and Senator <T4>Chiles </T4>and others are trying to build it, but I can tell you thatwhen you get in those subcommittees_Senator <T4>Pro<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>x<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>mire </T4>is chairman of that subcommittee. Ask himwhether he thinks there is going to be enough money to stretch around tobuild the space station or ask Chairman <T4>Eddie Boland </T4>in the House.[S11MY8-126]{S5426}EXONMr. EXON. Will the Senator yield for just a suggestion?[S11MY8-127]{S5426}JOHNSTONMr. JOHNSTON. Yes.[S11MY8-128]{S5426}EXONMr. EXON. I know he is cramped for time today. He has an amendment. Butsince the question the Senator just posed was one that the Senator fromWisconsin just told me that he evidently did not agree with the Senatoron, would the Senator like to have hi<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>m<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> respond to the question the Senator just asked atthis time and, if so, would the Senator yield to the Senator from Wisconsinfor that purpose?[S11MY8-129]{S5427}JOHNSTONMr. JOHNSTON. Yes, I would ask the Senator from Wisconsin, retaining myright to the floor, of course, that whether in his judgment, without thisamendment_we will discuss this amendment later_but without this amendment,whether in his view there is going to be enough money to build the spacestation.[S11MY8-130]{S5427}PROXMIREMr. PRO<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>X<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>MIRE. Mr. President, may I say to my good friendthat nobody has worked harder and more effectively and more wisely on SDIthan the Senator from Louisiana. He knows more about it and spends moretime on it than any of the rest of us. However, Mr. President, I, unfortunately, have to disagree with him, becausewhat I would like to do is to save $700 million. What this does is simplytransfer it from one purpose to another. I think the most important element of our defense is our economy. We haveto<CODE-213>5</CODE-213> <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>have a strong economy. We have been running deficitafter deficit. I would like to save the $700 million.Let me say that what the Senator's amendment does is reduce the SDI by$700 million. I would save that $700 million, much as we would like tohave it in our subcommittee of which I am the chairman, the HUD and IndependentAgencies Subcommittee; we could use it for a lot of purposes. I can tellyou that the space station is not one of the ones I would certainly putit into. The space station is going to cost $30 billion before we are through_$30billion.[S11MY8-131]{S5427}JOHNSTONMr. JOHNSTON. What is the SDI going to cost?[S11MY8-132]{S5427}PROXMIREMr. PROXMIRE. A trillion dollars.So that is exactly why I think we sho<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>u<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ld save in both these areas. I tried very hard tosee if I could work out a division on this and call for a separate voteon the two parts; in other words, cutting it from the SDI on one hand andadding it to the space station on the other. I found I could not do that.The Senator from Louisiana, as usual, is much too clever for me. He isway ahead of me.But what I can do is offer an amendment in the second degree, which I havehere and which I intend to offer, which would simply provide that $700million shall not be expe<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>n<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ded as an amendment and strike the section that wouldtransfer it to the space station. It seems to me this will give us an opportunityto vote on whether we want to save $700 million or not and have an increasein spending for SDI, but a modest increase of about 6 percent.<CODE-213>5</CODE-213><CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213><CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213><CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213><CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213><CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213><CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213><CODE-213>1</CODE-213>[S11MY8-133]<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>{S5427}<CODE-213>1</CODE-213>JOHNSTON<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>Mr. JOHNSTON. Well, I think that the Senator's answerto the question which I posed to him_which was: Is there enough money inthe budget without this to maintain the space station this year? I thinkthat answer is no; is that correct? Probably not, shall we say?<CODE-213>1</CODE-213>[S11MY8-134]<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>{S5427}<CODE-213>1</CODE-213>PROXMIRE<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>Mr. PROXMIRE. I think, undoubtedly, you would haveto slow down that particular operation. But, frankly, I think that themanned space station of the kind we have in Texas offers a far wiser wayto proceed.<CODE-213>1</CODE-213>[S11MY8-135]<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>{S5427}<CODE-213>1</CODE-213>JOHNSTON<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>Mr. JOHNSTON. I think, without question as to whatwe ought to do, just on the narrow question of in today's budget, keepin mind we have not done our 302(b) allocation. Does the Senator thinkthere would be money to maintain <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>the <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>space <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>station <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>together this year in that budget?<CODE-213>1</CODE-213>[S11MY8-136]<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>{S5427}<CODE-213>1</CODE-213>PROXMIRE<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>Mr. PROXMIRE. Well, I would agree with the Senatorthat it is going to be very difficult, very difficult all the way around.But I think that is the problem for all the subcommitte<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>e<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>s of the Appropriations Committee.<CODE-213>1</CODE-213>[S11MY8-137]<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>{S5427}<CODE-213>1</CODE-213>JOHNSTON<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>Mr. JOHNSTON. Exactly.<CODE-213>1</CODE-213>[S11MY8-138]<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>{S5427}<CODE-213>1</CODE-213>PROXMIRE<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>Mr. PROXMIRE. The Senator from Arkansas is a chairmanof a subcommittee. The Senator from Louisiana is a chairman of a subcommittee.We have to be very careful in all these areas and hold down spending. Thatis our job. It is one of the toughest problems the Senate, I am sure, inall its history has ever had to face. We are going to have to do that inmy subcommittee. It will not be enough. We will have to limit the funds.That is absolutely right.<CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>It is true in the armed services appropriation. Whenthat comes before the Appropriations Committee, we are going to have tolimit that. It is going to be tough, cruel, and mean, but we are goingto have to do that. That is w<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>h<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>y I would save $700 million this year and say letSDI go ahead at a reasonable pace but not a 20-percent increase, but a6-percent increase, which is what the Senator from Louisiana is askingus to do.<CODE-213>1</CODE-213>[S11MY8-139]<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>{S5427}<CODE-213>1</CODE-213>JOHNSTON<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, I urge my colleaguefrom Wisconsin not to urge that second-degree amendment on the Senate atthis time. First, because I would like to get a vote on this, of course;but, second, because I think an amendment which simply cut down SDI would,in fact, violate the summit agreement, because what the summit agreementprovided was both a floor and a ceiling of $299.5 billion in budget authority.The Armed Services Committee treated that mandate of the summit as bindingon the authorization committee, so that they have authorized only the $299.5billion.<CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>So to simply cut down in one category would be toreduce the $299.5 billion and violate the summit.<CODE-213>1</CODE-213>[S11MY8-140]<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>{S5427}<CODE-213>1</CODE-213>PROXMIRE<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>Mr. PROXMIRE. May I say to my good friend, I admireand respect the members of the Armed Services Committee. They have donea fine job. They are among the ablest people in this body. But I do notthink they can make a commitment for the rest of us. I did not make anycommitment of $299.5 billion. I think we can cut that by $700 million withoutbetraying our trust. Nobody told me to stand up and say I would <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>g<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>o ahead with it. And that is true of the overwhelmingmajority of Members of this body. I think we have that right.<CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>I have checked with the chairman of the Armed Service<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>s<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> Committee, Senator <CODE-213>1</CODE-213><T4><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>Nunn. <CODE-213>1</CODE-213></T4><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>He said we have a right to cut this budget belowwhat the Armed Service<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>s<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> Committee comes in for. I think we should do that.<CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>The notion that we should come to the floor and saywe are bound to provide every dollar that they request does not seem tome to be reasonable.<CODE-213>1</CODE-213>[S11MY8-141]<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>{S5427}<CODE-213>1</CODE-213>JOHNSTON<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>Mr. JOHNSTON. Well, there is, of course, a constitutionalright of this body to not adhere to the summit agreement.<CODE-213>1</CODE-213>[S11MY8-142]<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>{S5427}<CODE-213>1</CODE-213>PROXMIRE<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>Mr. PROXMIRE. We were never part of it.<CODE-213>1</CODE-213>[S11MY8-143]<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>{S5427}<CODE-213>1</CODE-213>JOHNSTONMr. <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>JOHNSTON<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>. Well, we did vote these numbers at $299.5 billion,and I believe it is $294 billion in budget obligations, as part of ourbudget resolution which has, in fact, passed here. But I would say thatthere are many Senators here, the Senator from Wisconsin may not be amongthem, who think we have a commitment to that, to the summit agreement.I certainly feel that way. There would be other amendments of other Senators which would spend theSDI money on other more important, in their vie<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>w<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>, defenses. [S11MY8-144]{S5427}PROXMIREMr. PROXMIRE. I would amend those, too.[S11MY8-145]{S5427}JOHNSTONMr. <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>JOHNSTON<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>. Excuse me?[S11MY8-146]{S5427}PROXMIREMr. PROXMIRE. I will amend every one of those if I get a chance to do it.I want to save the money, but I do not think we should transfer it anywhereelse. [S11MY8-147]{S5427}JOHNSTONMr. <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>JOHNSTON<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>. The Senator, of course, may put in a second-degreeamendment_obviously, the rules permit that_but I wish he would let us voteon this first, because I think it is a very clear choice between two priorities.[S11MY8-148]{S5427}PROXMIREMr. PROXMIRE. May I say to my good friend, I have no illusions about winningon my amendment. I just think the Senate ought to have a chance to voteon whether or not we should save $700 million or not. I will be gratifiedif I get a few votes. I am certainly not going to get a majority of votes,but I think the Senate ought to stand up and be counted on a $700 milliondecision here. I am going to ask the Senate to make that decision. I donot think it will hurt the Senator, and then he can press on with his amendment.[S11MY8-149]{S5427}JOHNSTONMr. <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>JOHNSTON<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>. Mr. President, I am also reminded that the numbersfrom the summit were also enacted into law as part of the budget reconciliationat the latter part of the last calendar year. Mr. President, to finish my statement in chief, the question is: What isthe highest priority, the increase in the NASA budget or the increase inthe SDI budget? The increase in the NASA budget, as previously stated,29 percent of that or $700 million, is to cover DOD launches. So that isthe DOD part of the NASA increase. The $700 million or, to be precise,$675 million represents the increase in SDI. Which is the higher priority?Mr. President, each year we debate the SDI budget. There are various justificationsfor the increases in SDI. Usually that argument goes something like this:well, the House is going to cut more, so, therefore, we have got to behigher so that we can meet them half way. But we never came to grips withthe question of what it is we are trying to do with SDI: What are the goalswe are trying to achieve? What kind of spending does it take to reach acertain goal? Does it make any sense to be going in certain directions?We mask all of those arguments and talk more in terms of what does it taketo make a compromise about some as yet undefined goal. Well, Mr. President, I think we have seen enough of SDI now to be ableto ascertain and assess that program with some real knowledge. First, weknow, Mr. President, that when the so-called star wars program was launchedfull blown from the ashes of the BAMBI program back in the President'sMarch 1983 speech, we know that that was hatched, more or less, in thePresident's mind. It did not come from the Joint Chiefs of Staff.In fact, it was not cleared with the Joint Chiefs of Staff. It was notcleared with the science advis<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>e<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>r. As a matter of fact, the science advis<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>e<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>r did not know of that at the time. On the very daythat the President was making his SDI speech, the Department of Defensewas testifying on the Hill, saying that we did no<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>t<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> need an increased program.The Air Force general in charge of direct energy technology research toldthe Senate Armed Services Committee that the purpose of strategic defense,and offense as well, is to maintain nuclear deterrence. Exotic laser orparticle beam technology could defeat a limited nuclear strike.So that on the very day that the President came out with this program,the Department of Defense, the Air Force, wa<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>s<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> going in opposite directions. And we know it camefrom the President.The President has told us, time and time again, it came from him. Revelations,lately, give us a new insight on why they call it star wars.But, in any event, it came from the President. Now, what do all the expertssay about star wars? Well, we know what the American Physical Society hassaid, Mr. President. There are 19 out of 20, or a higher percentage, Ithink, than that, of the American Physical Society people who say thatwe are going in the wrong direction on star wars and specifically thatthe space-based kinetic kill vehicle will not work.More to the point, the Department of Defense itself created a distinguishedreview board. On that review board are serving Bill Perry and Dr. Everettand a whole panel of distinguished people. Their report just came in lastweek, Mr. President. I am advised that this is a preliminary report, whichI have, dated April 13, 1987.But what that report states, Mr. President, is that to go to a phase 1deployment of kinetic kill vehicles, the phase 1 is where you put up acomplete system of orbiting rocket pods or space-based kinetic kill vehicles;a BSTS, boosted satellite tracking system; ERIS interceptors, which arethe ground-based interceptors_and the battle management system. That systemwhich would cost, according to the contractors, about $150 billion and,according to SDIO, would take $45.5 billion of additional research moneybefore you reached the decision as to whether to develop. And those aretheir figures. They say that the deployment of that system is very risky.What they say is that you ought to go into a six-step program. The firststep would be to have accidental launch protection. Well, now, Mr. President,it might be nice to have accident<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>a<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>l launch protection. Yesterday I asked the Secretaryof Defense about that. He said well, you know, if Libya, for example, gotintercontinental ballistic missiles, this would protect against Libya.Well, Mr. President, that really is an implausible threat and certainlyone that we do not need to spend billions and billions of dollars to defendagainst. If Libya has the atomic bomb, and we hope and pray that they donot, or North Korea or a host of other_well, maybe not a host, a numberof other irresponsible countries, then there are cheaper and better andmore effective ways of detonating those weapons here, as terrorist weapons,than by an ICBM. If they use an ICBM, we know where that weapon came fromand we can target tha<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>t<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> spot and blow them off the face of the Earth.But terrorists do not work like that. They would bring them in in suitcasesor, indeed, a briefcase. Thermonuclear weapons today are small enough toput in a briefcase. Not even a suitcase. And, if you know what the pouchthat comes in, the diplomatic pouches from around the world, our pouchesare not really pouches like a lit<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>t<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>le leather pouch. They are like multiple railroadcars full of things.So, if somebody wants to shoot an atomic weapon at the United States, theyare not going to launch it, intentionally or accident<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>a<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>lly, at the United States. They are going to bringit in in a suitcase or in a briefcase.[S11MY8-150]{S5428}NUNNMr. NUNN. Would the Senator yield just for an observation and question?[S11MY8-151]{S5428}JOHNSTONMr. JOHNSTON. Certainly.[S11MY8-152]{S5428}NUNNMr. NUNN. I think it is important we get our terms in the same vein here.The accident<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>a<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>l launch system, which I started talking about earlier,is not designed to protect against a terrorist attack by unconventio<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>na<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>l means. I do not think anyone even predicted that.In fact the very word accidental would denote something other than a deliberateact. The system that was being talked about_and I have not said that we shoulddeploy such a system, I do not think we have enough evidence yet, we donot know what it is going to cost, we do not know the feasibility, we donot know the coverage_but what I have said is we should explore that. Weshould devote some of this research money to that more limited purpose,which I think is also a more feasible purpose. But an accidental launchwould be a superpower accident. The Soviet Union having a launch of a ballisticmissile from a submarine or land-based or some other country having that.The other word that we had used would be ``unauthorized launch.'' An unauthorizedlaunch would not be an accident, but would be commander, being in charge,taking it on himself to cause a nuclear attack on the United States, limitedthough it might be, from his command. But it could be a very substantialattack if it was from a submarine. So, those are the terms we are using. And this question of the threat byterrorism against the United States, I think, has a different dimensionto it. I would agree with the Senator from Louisiana that that kind ofthreat is more likely to come by nonconventional means rather than by ballisticmissile. Although I must add that the developments in the Middle East between Iranand Iraq, where they are firing missiles at each other's key cities andthe new deployment, at least planned deployment, of missiles in Saudi Arabiathat would have a medium-range capability, gives us the apprehension thatthat is where the world is heading. So, down the road it may very well be there will be a threat against theUnited States from one of those sources, but I think we ought to keep theaccident<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>a<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>l launch terminology separate from the ``threat byterrorists.'' At some point, we may decide that both of those threats areworthy of our attention, but it would not be by the same defensive mechanism.And I would hope we would keep those distinctions in mind. [S11MY8-153]{S5428}JOHNSTONMr. JOHNSTON. I thank my friend for his explanation. The reason I mentionedLibya is when I questioned the Secretary of Defense yesterday on the verysubject of the six steps and the accidental launch, that was the examplehe brought up. I think when the Senator from Georgia first mentioned accidentallaunch, he did not have Libya in mind at all. But that was being discussedby the Secretary of Defense in the Defense Appropriations Committee hearingyesterday.[S11MY8-154]{S5428}NUNNMr. NUNN. I would more nearly call that a third-country attack; a countrynot major superpower. But I would imagine if Libya started deploying missilesand we woke up one morning and found one heading toward the United Stateswe would not consider that to be an accident.[S11MY8-155]{S5429}JOHNSTONMr. JOHNSTON. The Senator and I discussed this accidental launch protectionand, as he points out himself, he and his committee are not proposing that.It is in the ``pre-preliminary thought stage,'' as it ought to be.The point I am making is that this defense science board panel recommendssix steps. There is the accidental launch system. The next step is to deploythe BSTS, or boost surveillance and tracking system; and then the thirdstep is ERIS interceptors, the ground-based interceptors, the fourth stepis more ground-based interceptors.It is only in the fifth step that you get the space-based interceptorsand in the sixth step, the directed energy weapons. That is some time inthe next century.But the point is, that we proceed with SDI, it was hatched without scientificexamination, and it continues on, in spite of the evidence, without realdirection.It seems to me that the evidence is irrefutable that SDI, that is, thespace-based kinetic kill vehicles, the orbiting rocket pods previouslyrejected twice by this country in the BAMBI Program in the 1960's and thehigh frontier programs in the 1980's, clearly rejected before the President'sMarch 1983 speech, that that kind of technology can never pass the Nitzetest of cost effective at the margin.What does cost effective in the margin in the Nitze test mean? By the way,the Nitze test says, in effect, that we should not deploy a system whereit costs us more to build a rocket or to kill a rocket than it costs themto build a substitute for that rocket.Let us say the other side has 100 rockets which you can shoot down for$100 million. You do not want to build that ballistic missile defense systemif they can employ additional rockets at one-tenth that cost.That is about where we are in the evidence, Mr. President. We know, forexample, that the figures are $45 billion. SDI says it takes you $45 billionof additional research money before you can make the decision as to whetherto develop the space kinetic kill vehicles, and the so-called phase 1.Then the cost, according to the contractors, of a phase 1 would be about$150 billion. What percentage of the Soviet rocket force will that shootdown? About 16 percent. That is in the public domain. You can figure thatout. It takes you $150 billion, and we will add to that whatever the portionof the $45 billion Randamp;D you want to include, and figure what it costsyou to shoot down 16 percent of about 10,000 Soviet ICBM's. That is roughly1,600 Soviet ICBM's. For the total of $150 billion cost, divide 1,600 warheadsinto $150 billion and then compare that with what it costs to build additionalwarheads.We know that according to the published figures we can build the D-5 missilefor about $28 million per missile. If you add in silos and nuclear warheadsfor that, it would be about $50 million per missile, each with eight warheads.So the comparison is an additional missile for about $50 million completewith silo, the latest faster-burn technology. Compare that to the costof intercepting that with <CODE-213>1</CODE-213>phase <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>1, and you can get a lack of cost effective in themargin of about 2 to 1. I think it exceeds 2 to 1 by a long way if youlook at warheads.So, what we need to do with the SDI Program is to reassess it, reevaluateit, and not mindlessly continue to increase it every year.I am not talking about gutting the SDI Program. The SDI Program had a bigincrease last year. What we are talking about doing is maintaining theSDI Program where it is now while we reevaluate it, while we take the adviceof the best scientists available in America, and while we put the moneyon higher priority items.So to repeat, what this amendment does is to set priorities. It is to comparethe space program with the SDI Program and to decide where that $700 millionshould go. I believe it is much more important to build a space stationthan to mindlessly continue to put money down this space-based kinetickill vehicle rathole.The scientists tell us it is not going to work; it is never going to becost effective in the margin; time is going to overwhelm that system.What we ought to be doing on SDI is redirecting our efforts toward theenergy beam weapons. That is where the promise of SDI can come for thefuture, that is where the research ought to be done, and we ought to quitwasting the money on the kinetic kill vehicles.That $700 million increase in SDI is just what it takes to build a spacestation.I yield the floor.[S11MY8-156]{S5429}PROXMIREMr. PROXMIRE addressed the Chair.The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. <T4>Reid</T4>).

The clerk will report.The legislative clerk read as follows:[S11MY8-159]{S5429}<ITAG tagnum="21">The Senator from Wisconsin [Mr. <T4>Proxmire</T4>] proposes an amendment numbered 2017.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In the amendment strike all after ``6)'' and insert the following:``$700 million shall not be expended''.</ITAG>[S11MY8-160]{S5429}PROXMIREMr. PROXMIRE. Mr. President, the purpose of this amendment I think hasbeen explained in the debate already. What the amendment will do is simplysave the $700 million the distinguished Senator from Louisiana has arguedshould be saved in the SDI <CODE-213>1</CODE-213>Program. <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>It will cut the SDI <CODE-213>1</CODE-213>Program <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>from an increase of 20 percent to an increase of6 percent. You still have an increase; you still have $3.8 billion expendedfor SDI, but we would save $700 million.Seven hundred million dollars in a trillion dollar budget may not be verymuch, but $700 million here and there adds up to real money.I think we ought to keep in mind that we do have a terrific deficit. Ashas been pointed out in the debate before, I am chairman of the subcommitteethat would get this $700 million if the amendment is not changed as I suggest.Of course, we could use it. Of course, it would make it easier for us.The most important action the Congress can do, in the judgment of thisSenator, is to do everything we can to hold down the deficit, and we shoulddo that by cutting spending.Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the amendment.The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?There is a sufficient second.The yeas and nays were ordered.[S11MY8-161]{S5429}EXONMr. EXON addressed the Chair.The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.[S11MY8-162]{S5429}EXONMr. EXON. Mr. President, the Senator from Nebraska has been wa<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>it<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ing patiently for 1 hour and 20 minutes after myfriend from Louisiana had offered his amendment to give a response andthe position of the Armed Services Committee on his amendment.I have no quarrel with the attitude that the Senator from Louisiana and,indeed, the Senator from Wisconsin have with regard to the SDI <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>P<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>rogram. I share many of the concerns they have sinceI have been intricately involved in this matter from the very beginning.I would simply say, let us try and keep all of this in context. It is true,in my mind, that one of the grave mistakes made with the SDI <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>P<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>rogram was that from the day the President made theannouncement, there has been more false information as to what this programcould possibly bring about than any other defense program that I have everhad anything to do with.The President has certainly fanned much of that himself. I have been oneof those who said we are way overboard on what can be done with this program.But I have always thought, in view of the Soviet threat_and what the SovietUnion is doing in this area today experimentationwise_we have an obligationto at least proceed to see what is here.One of the worst things that happened, Mr. President, in this whole unfortunate,or f<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>o<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>rtunate, discussion of SDI, depending upon one'spoint of view, was the series of television advertisings that went outa year and a half or 2 years ago which had a little girl with a crayondrawing an umbrella and then with the very clever audiovisual aids, whileshe was playing with this umbrella, the next thing you saw was crudelydrawn bombs coming out of the air and glancing off of the umbrella in aharmless fashion. I thought that was a very simplistic way to try to describethe SCI <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>P<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>rogram, not unlike some of the statements that thePresident of the United States himself has made about it. But I thoughtthat was so simplistic that I hoped it would have had the desired effecton the American people in recognizing that any concept that we can havea perfect shield is nonsense. It is hogwash. It is never going to fly.Having said that, I think there are some benefits of a research programin the strategic defense initiative area and I <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>have supported that<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>. I will move at an appro<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>p<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>riate time_and I hope it will not be too long_tot<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ab<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>le the amendment offered by the Senator from Wisconsin,and after that I intend to move to table the amendment offered by the Senatorfrom Louisiana. I simply am going to try as briefly as I can to put thisin context, Mr. President, so that the Senate will really know what weare doing.Now, if you are against the SDI <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>P<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>rogram and think it shou<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ld<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> be abolished or cut drastically, as the Senatorfrom Wisconsin is suggesting, then you should support that amendment, ifyou are basically against SDI in the amount the Armed Services Committeefeels would be proper funding. Likewise, regardless of how it is presentedto the Senate, the amendment of the Senator from Louisiana essentiallydoes the same thing except the Senator from Louisiana is suggesting thatwe can use this money for defense bet<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>t<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>er over here on the space shuttle.Now, I think that is not sound logic, and I want to emphasize once again,Mr. President, that the funding level of SDI, if anyone thinks we shouldhave some research and development in that area_and I would suggest thatthe SDI exercise has done more to bring the Soviets to the bargaining tablethan probably anything that we have done_is worth continuing at about thelevel that we funded SDI last year.Now, a lot of figures are being thrown around, Mr. President. <CODE-213>1</CODE-213>We <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>should remember that last year we had a funding levelfor the SDI program of $3.9 billion. The President first requested a levelof over $6 billion. That was amended down to $4.8 billion in the formalrequest that came over from the administration. We have reduced that further.The House of Representatives in its actions of last week reduced that programto $3.4 billion, which essentially would have been more than one-half ofa billion dollars below last year's figure. If we would accept the amendmentoffered by the Senator from Wisconsin or the amendment offered by the Senatorfrom Louisiana, we would be down, even splitting the difference with theHouse of Representatives in conference, to a figure some $300 million to$400 million less than last year. I think that is far below what wouldbe proper and wise at this particular juncture.There has been a lot of talk about the violation of the summit agreement.I am somewhat like the Senator from Wisconsin in that I was not a partof that agreement, but the facts are we have been proceeding in the BudgetCommittee, in the Armed Services Committee, and hopefully in the AppropriationsCommittee to say that this was an agreement made by the President of theUnited States with the leadership of both the majority and minority inthe House of Representatives and in the Senate, and it was necessary, ofcourse, because of the severe budget constraints in which we found ourselves.Regardless of how it is postured, Mr. President, the Senator from Wisconsinhas clearly said he is not trying to disguise it. He feels he has thisright, which he does and with which I agree. He asked me about it and Isaid it is entirely appropriate to offer an amendment. The Senator fromLouisiana has disguised it somewhat in that he is saying he is not cuttingdefense: he is cutting defense, but he is putting it over into a separateprogram that has a relationship to defense.Now, there has been a lot of talk this morning about how important theshuttle is to the national defense interests of the United States, andto a certain point that is true. That is why, Mr. <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>President, <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>over the years there has been planned there wouldbe 15_15, Mr. President_shuttle flights that would carry some militarypayload. Indeed, out of the Department of Defense budget over the yearswe have funded some $4 billion, and so far we have got little or nothingfrom the investment that the Department of Defense made in the shuttleprogram. As a result of the tragic shuttle accident, the payload of the shuttlehas been cut down so that it can no longer provide launch into polar orbitfrom Vandenberg where we need satellites to carry on critical monitoringactivities. I would say now that if there is one serious concern whichwe should all have today, as has been evidenced by the debate which isgoing on now with regard to verification of the INF Treaty, if there isone place that we have a serious shortfall at the present time it is inthe area of surveillance from the satellites that the shuttle was supposedto provide. What we have done, which I referred to earlier in our give and take withthe Senator from Louisiana, what the A<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>rm<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ed Services Committee has done and what the Departmentof Defense is doing and recommending is that we no longer rely on thatsingle vehicle, basically, the shuttle. I would <CODE-213>1</CODE-213>simply <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>like to read from the report of our committee atpage 37, and I think probably this would help clarify for Members of theSenate why both of these amendments that are now before us would be badfrom the national security interests of the United States. Mr. President, I quote from page 37 of the Armed Services Committee report:[S11MY8-163]{S5430}<ITAG tagnum="21">As a result of availability and performance considerations, and theNational Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA) desire to work offthe backlog of non-DOD payloads, the current shuttle manifest for DOD showsonly Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) and Research and Development relatedflights with unique manned requirements after 1992. In view of the immenseDOD investment in the shuttle the committee believes that a very thoroughreview of the long term prospects for future DOD utilization of the shuttleis required before any actions are taken that would preclude use of theshuttle from either coast after 1995. A reporting requirement to this endis described below. In a related <CODE-213>1</CODE-213>action, <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>the committee recommended a prohibition on the expenditureof any funds for the proposed new Titan IV pad at Vandenberg pending completionof the shuttle utilization study.</ITAG>Mr. President, I want to also have the U.S. Senate know that the StrategicSubcommittee of the Armed Services Committee went into this whole mattervery, very thoroughly. We agreed that with the new constraints that areput on the shuttle_and I want to add that this is a Senator that has supportedthe shuttle program and all space programs in the future. But I am talkingnow about the national security interests of the United States. I hopemy voice will be heard that it is not in my view in the national securityinterests of the United States to go ahead with what is being recommendedhere when we in the Armed Services Committee have gone into this very carefullyand in great detail.I will probably have some more <CODE-213>1</CODE-213>to <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>say on this as we go on. But I know my friend andcolleague from Virginia has been very much involved in all of these programssince their inception. If possible, I would like to yield to my friendfrom Virginia for any remarks that he might have. [S11MY8-164]{S5430}BUMPERSMr. BUMPERS addressed the Chair. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator yield the floor? [S11MY8-165]{S5430}EXONMr. EXON. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas. [S11MY8-166]{S5430}BUMPERSMr. BUMPERS. Thank you, Mr. President. Mr. President, I will try to be briefer than usual, considering the feelingsthat I have about this amendment. But I want to start off by saying assolemnly as I know how, that we are dealing here with a momentous issue.I strongly urge my colleagues to give this issue at least the same scrutinythey would give food stamps, Medicaid, or the new welfare bill which isgoing to be coming before us The number of Senators on the floor <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>r<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ight now would indicate that this issue is beingtreated rather capriciously and almost whimsically, and yet we are talkingabout the fate of the good planet Earth. We are talking about a budgetdeficit that is absolutely out of control. So I sincerely hope that the staffs at least who are present will communicateto their Senators however they may feel about this debate. My temptationalways on an issue like this about which I feel very strongly is to makea jury argument. As a former trial lawyer I have a tendency to make a juryargument on everything. But I would say this: I would be delighted to goon national television and debate anybody from General Abrahamson to thePresident or anybody else on this proposition. Resolved, that most of the money we spend on SDI will weaken this Nation,not strengthen it. And leave that proposition after the debate in the handsof the American people. Can the argument now be made that $23 billion onthe 50 MX missiles, about 23 of which we bought still not operational,and the ones that are sitting in vulnerable silos where the Minuteman IIIformerly resided, and does anybody in this body now think that was a wiseexpenditure of money? Some will say of course it was. I say it was an utterwaste. I said it then and I say it now. I am proud that I voted againstit. Can anyody here now say that the B-1 bomber which was proposed as a low-flyingbomber to enter the Soviet Union, penetrate the Soviet Union at low altitude_andall of those arguments which I will not repeat_and will anybody here nowmake the argument that the $30 billion we spent for that bomber, and wereceived the 99th and last one just last week, was well spent? That programis over, we have 99 of them. Does anybody here now argue that program wasa wise expenditure of $30 billion when the B-1 will hardly fly let alonepenetrate? The reason we have 99 instead of 100 is because a blackbird shot down oneof them. I have said if the Soviet Union really wants an air defense systemagainst a 400-feet altitude flying B-1 bomber, just store up millions ofblackbirds and release them. You can take down almost every one of them.I see no reason why you could not. That is the way we lost one. Is thatnot right? But no, the arguments around here is always suspect. You can be accusedof being weak on defense. How many times do you hear in the privacy ofthe cloakroom right there, ``Nobody is going to get to the right of meon defense,'' and so we keep spending more money for things you and I bothknow are nonsensical, and never <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>will <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>be completed.   I will say to you right now I do not know whether I will be here for somebodyto say you were crazy or not, but I will tell you this: SDI will neverbe deployed. I am just as certain of that as I am of my name, and whenI finish with my arguments, I will tell you how I arrived at that conclusion.Let us just talk for a moment about the Paul Nitze argument. He said twovery sensible things, and incidentally, everybody in this body as far asI know has an immense respect for this man, Paul Nitze, the President<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>'<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>s top arms control adviser. He said SDI only makessense if it is cost<CODE-213>5</CODE-213> <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>effective and survivable. What does he mean whenhe says cost<CODE-213>5</CODE-213> <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>effective? He says that simply means if we can deployit and defeat Soviet missiles cheaper than they could overwhelm the system,that would be a good sign for SDI. We now know both through classifiedand unclassified information_this is in the public domain_that the Sovietscan probably defeat the system on a magnitude of 5<CODE-213>5</CODE-213> <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>to<CODE-213>5</CODE-213> <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>10<CODE-213>5</CODE-213> <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>to<CODE-213>5</CODE-213> <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>1 cheaper than we can build it. If you tell me inthe face of overwhelming evidence that the Soviet Union can spend $1 forevery $5 to $10 we spend and be just as well off, does this system makesany sense to you? You do not invest your money that way. Incidentally,I will tell you an interesting story about this budget deficit.There is an old gent in Arkansas, and he is a dyed-in-the-wool Democrat,but I remember in 1981_you just get native intelligence often from peoplewho never went to the eighth grade_when President Reagan was goi<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>n<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>g around the country and on national television saying,``We are going to cut your taxes by 28 percent; we are going to doublethe defense budget and balance the budget,'' this old man said, ``Whata dynamite idea. I wonder why we never thought of that before?''Nobody argues that under the best case scenario this system is going tobe fail safe, and is going to be 100 percent effective. If you ask GeneralAbrahamson today, ``General, if you had all the money in the world to buildthis system, what is the very best kill rate you could possibly anticipate?''the figures I have heard are 90 percent. But nobody believes that. I cantell you the Soviets have about 12,000 warheads. If 1,200 of them got through,that is enough to ruin your whole day. That is enough to destroy the greatplanet Earth.I have seen those little television cartoons in 30-seconds spots. I donot know who paid for them. The little girl is saying, ``My daddy is sosmart. He believes in this system that the President is talking about thatwill protect our home from Soviet missiles. M<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>y<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> daddy is so smart.'' You all saw that spot on television,did you not? All of a sudden, slowly but surely the information comes outwhich all of us knew in the first place, this system is not designed toprotect population centers.It is not designed to protect this little girl. It is designed to protectcommand and control centers, and military targets.Nobody has ever made the argument, with the pos<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>s<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ible exception of the President, who at least ledpeople to believe that somehow or other they were going to live and theSoviets were going to die if we built this system.Well, it assumes the ultimate technology. This argument is that if we justput this thing up in the sky, nobody will ever be able to improve on it.I ask you: What technology have you ever known of that was not improved?If we deploy SDI, we'll never be able to rest. We'll have to keep on <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>improving <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>it to keep ahead of the Soviets.Then there is the burn time issue: can the Soviets shorten their missileburn times so that SDI interceptions w<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>o<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>n<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>'<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>t have enough time to destroy the missiles? The MXhas a burn time of 180 seconds. The Trident I missile, which we have onmost of our submarines, has a burn time of 158 seconds. The Trident IImissile has a burn time of 171 seconds. And we anticipate that we willnot pick up the burn of a Soviet missile for 30 to 60 seconds after itis launched.<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>Bear in mind that nobody in the Soviet Union, when they were building theirmissiles, was trying to defeat SDI. They were just building a missile.They were just designing missiles that would hit the United States. Theywere not trying to get the shortest burn time possible. It would not bedifficult for either side to shorten their missile burn times.Here is a study put out by Lawrence Livermore Laboratories that shows thatif we deploy the so-called kinetic kill vehicles, the Soviets already haveone missile, the SS-25, which is totally invulnerable to a kinetic killvehicle. $330 million of this $4.7 billion we are talking about is goinginto research for kinetic kill vehicles; and it is now anticipated thatto deploy it in 1995_we will be lucky to get it up by the year 2000_butif we can deploy it, and I do not care if you deploy 3,000 of them or 30,000of them, the Soviet SS-25 right now is alrea<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>dy invulnerable to the technology that we are talkingabout being the ultimate.Their other missiles are liquid-propelled missiles, and they will convertthem to solid propellant as soon as possible, which burn much faster. Theywill build a new fleet of missiles that will leave us no time to interceptthem.They can revolve their missiles. They do not do it now, but they can slowlyrevolve their missiles on liftoff, which means that we have to have two<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>to<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> three times as much power in our lasers. They canthicken the hulls on their missiles, which will require another doubling.They can put millions of decoys in the noses of these missiles, and wehave to figure out which ones are real and which ones are not. They canmake their missiles maneuverable.This is not classified, and I will bet there are not 50 Senators who knowthis: The Trident II missile, which the Navy calls the D-5, and which Ihave been a strong supporter of because it is invulnerable, being on submarines,has a very low CEP_that is, the error margin where it hits. That missileis very accurate. It is going to have hard target kill capability, andwe are going to deploy those this fall on the Trident submarine.Another thing the missile will do is maneuver. Do you know something? TheSoviets do not <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>have <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>maneuver capability on their missiles yet, but whenthey do, I can tell you that, based on present plans for SDI, a maneuverablevehicle will defeat SDI.I can remember that, as a child, I was worried about Hitler. I was a paperboy.Every afternoon when I got my papers to fold, to throw them on the frontyards and porches of my customers, I would see the headlines about whatHitler was up to.As a child, younger than these pages who sit here, I became apprehensiveabout what this all meant. It later meant 3 years in the Marine Corps forme, 3 years out of my life.I had that sneaky suspicion even as a child. But I will tell you one thing:I would read about the French having this gigantic Maginot Line, and asa child, I was comfronted by that. I thought that no matter how powerfulan army Hitler had, the French will be able to stop him because they havethis big Maginot Line. I did not know what that meant. I did not know whatit was designed to stop.I am not going to belabor this point, because everybody here remembersjust how powerful the Maginot Line was. Hitler went over it, around it.The Maginot Line did not slow up the Germany Army 24 hours.Yet, the argument is made here that, somehow or other, we can put a technologyin the sky and that is going to be the end of it. You tell me one thingwe have ever done technically in this country that we have not improvedon. We'll have to keep on adding to it.I remember the ABM system. I was not here, but the decision to spend $6billion to deploy the ABM system in North Dakota passed the U.S. Senateby 1 vote.The argument was made by the losing side at that time that by the timeyou got it built, it would be obsolete and probably was not going to work,anyway. But, as always, we had a bunch of Senators that did not want togo home and have somebody charge them with being weak on defense, so theyvoted for it, and we started dismantling that system before the last weaponwas installed. I was here when we voted to dismantle it.Some people say: ``Senator, you're a skeptic. You didn't think we couldsend somebody to the Moon, either; and if you had been here, you wouldn'thave thought we would ever develop airplanes.''Well, I was around when the first ABM system was built, and I am sorryI was not here to be the vote to defeat it.I was not around here when we started talking about nuclear-powered airplanes,which we have not done yet either. But in all those technologies that peoplearound here like to talk about, we did not have the Soviet Union tryingto defeat the system. They are light years behind us in technology. Everybodyknows that. Even Gorbachev knows they are on their way to becoming a third-ratenation if they continue to spend 15 percent of their gross national producton defense.Well, back to the kinetic kill vehicles: Our own Office of Technology Assessmenthad a question: The software is very vulnerable to errors, and the wholesystem is vulnerable to a host of countermeasures.Incidentally, one other thing I did not mention is that the Soviets canjust fire a few missiles up with nuclear weapons on them, set them off,and blind SDI.Several years ago, when this whole thing came up, I asked a very respectedarms negotiator, whom I consider one of the wisest arms negotiators, something.I said: ``Suppose you were advising Secretary Gorbachev, and he calledyou in and he said, `Mr. So-and-So, the United States is getting readyto build this defensive shield against our missiles. What do you advise?'''He said, ``I'll tell you what I would tell him. I would tell him, No. 1,`Start building bombers as fast as you can build them. No. 2, start buildingships that will accommodate anywhere from 30 to 100 <CODE-213>1</CODE-213>cruise <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>missiles. Third, if you really feel that this isa serious problem, you can always consider the clandestine introductionof nuclear weapons into the United States. If they can't keep carloadsof <CODE-213>1</CODE-213>marijuana <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>from coming into the country, certainly we can introducenuclear weapons. We can plant them at the base of the Empire State Buildingand at the Washington Monument, and have them ready to detonate at a moment'snotice.' ''Can you imagine anything more ominous than our reaching that point? Have you noticed that Gorbachev does not talk about SDI anymore?He says that is not really a big deterrent. Do you know why? Because hisadvisers apparently have convinced him that if we want to spend $1 trilliondoing this, this is OK, but they could probably defeat it for $100 billion.That is the <CODE-213>1</CODE-213>reason <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>he quit talking about it.The Senator from New York [Mr. <T4>Moynihan</T4>] who I heard 3 years ago, in discussing the <CODE-213>1</CODE-213>SDI <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>Program, said we have a fixation somehow that allmissiles come in from outer space, but the truth is a lot of them are goingto come in under the Brooklyn Bridge.

No. 1, how dare they? No. 2, if they build their own SDI that meansthat our missiles are then vulnerable to their SDI and we have to startbuilding a whole new generation of ICBM's.

The Russ<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ian <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>AS-15, a cruise missile that can travel about 3,000kilometers (1,875 miles), became operational in 1984. The missiles canbe mounted on Bear-H bombers, which can fire at a safe distance from theirtargets. U.S. F-15 pilots in Alaska report a sharp increase in the numberof Bear-H bombers conducting exercises. Mr. Thompson estimates that by1991, the Soviets will have more than 100 Bear-H bombers, along with about1,000 AS-15 cruise missiles.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The Soviets have deployed cruise missiles that can be launched fromany of the three newest classes of submarines. These submarines are significantlyquieter than the boats they are replacing, and thus able to travel closerto the U.S. coastlines.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Pentagon officials say that the ne<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>we<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>st Soviet cruise missiles carry accurate terrain-readingguidance systems similar to those in U.S. cruise missiles. The Sovietsare also designing a long-range supersonic cruise missile that would bemore difficult to intercept.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The latest edition of ``Soviet Military Power,'' released by the PentagonFriday, says the Soviets have produced 11 Blackjack bombers, which resemblethe U.S. B-1 sweptwing bomber. The publication says that with the Blackjackand the Bear-H bombers, the Soviet ``intercontinental bomber force is moreflexible than it has ever been.'' The Pentagon report noted that the twoaircraft could be refueled in flight by the Midas tanker plane, fieldedin 1987.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">U.S. worries about these new weapons may turn out to be unnecessary,like the missile and bomber gaps of past eras. Intelligence assessmentshave found that the Soviets often hit technological snarls building bigsupersonic bombers like the Blackjack. Although the Pentagon for severalyears has been predicting that the Blackjack was about to surge into fullproduction, this hasn't happened. One Defense Department official says,``We think it's in the realm of being deployed.''</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Though the bombers and cruise missiles still only represent about10% of the Soviets' total nuclear arsenal, the low-flying systems couldmount a decapitating strike on U.S. command and control centers the presidentwould rely on during a crisis.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Thirty years ago, the U.S. maintained a broad network of radars, interceptorplanes, and ground-to-air missiles to thwart a feared Soviet bomber attack.But in the 1960s, when both superpowers were building up ballistic missilesthat could rain warheads down from space, the U.S. decided against sinkingmoney into what would be only a partial defense. In the 1990s, the Pentagoncould be faced with the opposite problem_being able to deflect nuclearattacks in space but not inside the atmosphere.</ITAG>[S11MY8-172]<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,i1,s10,10,6</C>U.S. AIR DEFENSES<H1> </H1><H1>Early 1960's</H1><H1>Today</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Interceptor planes<D>2,612</D><D>252</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Air Force surface-to-air missiles<D>439</D><D>0</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Army surface-to-air missile batteries<D>274</D><D>0</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Air defense control centers<D>68</D><D>7</D><F>Source: Georgetown University National Security Studies Program.</F></ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">U.S. military planners are taking some steps to lessen the disparity.The Pentagon is installing modern radar equipment along the aging DistantEarly Warning line in northern Canada. Powerful radar equipment is beingdesigned for the coastlines as well, and the Air Force is buying GeneralDynamics Corp. F-16s to replace old interceptor planes.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">However, strategists say these moves fall far short of providing acomprehensive defense against the Soviet's newest low-flying weapons. Underpressure from Congress, the Pentagon has set up an Air Defense Initiativeto study high-tech approaches. However, this project has only attracteda fraction of the funds dedicated to the better-known SDI.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">``The Air Force has never been very excited about the air-defensemission,'' says one Pentagon official. He notes that under budget pressures,the service generally chops air-defense projects to keep money flowingto bombers and fighter jets.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Some analysts argue that building a complex U.S. air-defense systemcould be a waste of money. The Soviets have spent billions setting up airdefenses; but the Pentagon claims its low-flying B-1 bomber, Stealth bomberand advanced cruise missiles can get through the thicket of defenses. Pointingto what may turn out to be wasted expenditures by the Soviets, a Houseaide says, ``We're not going to clamor for a big increase.''</ITAG>[S11MY8-173]{S5433}BUMPERSMr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, some money for SDI for research is appropriateand reasonable, and I am not going to debate that. Everybody here agreeswith that.But one of the reasons that I am on my feet here today is I know what isgoing on. I have been here now almost 14 years, and if you pay attentionaround here, you learn a few things. One of the things I have learned isthat in this program the President keeps asking for more and more and notjust because he believes in it, but people in Congress keep voting formore and more to accommodate the President. What they are trying to dois to build a momentum for this whole cockamamie idea so that we will haveto go forward with it after Ronald Regan is no longer in the White House.I am reluctant to say this, but I heard one of our Republican colleaguesabout a year ago say, ``Yes, Senator, we know that this is a crazy idea.This is what we on our side of the aisle call the `humor-the-President'program.''I want to tell you that when I read Paul Kennedy's book about the UnitedStates being threatened with decline, and I have to look at my childrenand admit that my generation and yours, colleagues, is going to be thefirst generation in the history of this country to hand our country overto them at least economically in potentially worse shape than it was whenwe found it, and one of the reasons is that the herd instinct sweeps throughthis body on taxes and defense spending and nobody really wants to sitdown and talk sense about what is an adequate amount of defense and aretaxes really what you pay in order to live in civilized society, as JusticeHolmes said.Paul Kennedy said the United States could be in decline because we arespending 7 percent of our national product to defend countries like Japanthat spends 1 percent. If we spent 1 percent of our GNP on defense, wewould have a balanced budget and $100 billion to educate our children,provide health care for the 37 million people in this country that do nothave any, to repair the 52,000 bridges that are fatally defective in thiscountry, and on and on the list goes.People act as though SDI is the ultimate defense.I said many times on this floor, and it bears repeating, we ought to makeourselves sit down and talk about something else that is related to ournational security, and that is how well we treat each other, how we feelabout our institutions, how well we educate our children, how well we takecare of our elderly, what kind of a transportation system do we have. Thosethings are just as important to our security as how many planes and tanksand guns we have.Well, Paul Kennedy says, if it will give you any comfort, the Sovet Unionis in a faster rate of decline than we are because their GNP is only halfas great as ours, so they have to spend 15 percent of their GNP to matchus dollar for dollar, but to their eternal credit_Secretary Gorbachev hasadmitted this publicly and he has said that they can never fullfil thepromise of their system. I do not think they will anyway because theirsystem is fatally flawed. He said they certainly cannot do it and spend15 percent of their wealth on defense.So, Mr. President, as I said a moment ago, I am not too crazy about transferring$700 million over to space. I am going to vote for that because I thinkthe space station is probably going to be built, but I am going to votefor the amendment of the Senator from Wisconsin because I want to believethat some of these days we are going to come to our senses around hereabout what we really need to do to become a leaner, more efficient andeffective fighting country in our military, and I can tell you the expenditureof $4.5 to $5 billion on SDI year after year, headed for a trillion dollars,weakens America. As I say, I would love to debate the proposition thatthat weakens this country; it does not strengthen us.Mr. President, I yield the floor.[S11MY8-174]{S5433}EXONMr. EXON.

Mr. President, I think the Senator from Louisiana is technicallycorrect. He has very skillfully stayed within a technical framework. But,in terms of the spirit of the budget agreement and the spirit of the sum<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>mi<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>t, it is gone.[S11MY8-201]{S5435}JOHNSTONMr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, I quoted from the defense appropriation report.I am sorry if I gave the impression that that was the Armed Services Committee.I was not. It was the defense appropriation rep<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>or<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>t.But the defense appropriation rep<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ort<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> clearly recognized, before this <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>amendment<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> arose, that NASA has a direct relationship to defense.[S11MY8-202]{S5435}WARNERMr. WARNER. Mr. President, I yield on that point. The Senator is correct.There is a direct relationship, as evidenced by the facts being broughtforth that after 1992 we will have far less reliance on it.<CODE-213>5</CODE-213> To<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> me, those are subsidiary arguments.My point is, if we are ever to have an expectation of a budget summit holdingup, then we cannot trash this one. And that is the essence of what is goingto happen here.[S11MY8-203]{S5435}JOHNSTONMr. JOHNSTON. Only, if I might say to the Senator, if NASA does not havea relationship to defense. If you can say that NASA has no relationshipto defense, <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>yo<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ur argument is logically correct. If it does, itis not logicially correct.You may disagree with it, you may not like a space station, but as faras having a relationship to defense, it has long been recognized. The AppropriationsCommittee has recognized it. The Senate has recognized it. The 29 percentis mathematically the proper share, considering the 15 launches <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>of<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> the 52 NASA launches.[S11MY8-204]{S5435}WARNERMr. WARNER. Mr. President, other Members of the Senate could come in andmake the same arguments with respect to ho<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>us<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ing, medical things, all types of subjects whichhave a relationship to defense and defense dependence on certain otherprograms and we slowly begin to bring down the effectiveness of the defensecap.[S11MY8-205]{S5435}JOHNSTONMr. JOHNSTON. If we added some money for defense housing or for the CHAMPUSProgram, you would clearly say that that is not breaching the cap. But,obviously, if we added <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>it<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> for civilian housing, it would. This 29 percent,the $700 million, is for the DOD share of NASA.[S11MY8-206]{S5435}WARNERMr. WARNER. Mr. President, the essence of what the Senator is doing istaking dollars away from the Cabinet officer assigned to this budget, theSecretary of Defense, and effectively pu<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>t<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ting it in another budget.We can use the technicalities that <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>you <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>skillfully moved it around, but, <CODE-213>1</CODE-213>in <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>essence, it violates the spirit of the summit <CODE-213>1</CODE-213>agreement. <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>And it was the summit agreement that rescued theCongress from sitting here throughout that period doing nothing. You rememberit <CODE-213>1</CODE-213>well. <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>You were on the committee.[S11MY8-207]{S5435}JOHNSTONMr. JOHNSTON. Let me tell you. Senator, at the summit agreement we puta cap of $299.5 billion in BA, which was both a cap and a ceiling. I agreewith that. That is why I opposed the Proxmire amendment. But we never saidhow we defined how that $299.5 billion should be made up.There are those who think we ought to spend more of the <CODE-213>1</CODE-213>$299.5 <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>billion on SDI. There are those who think we oughtto spend less. There are those who think we ought to build an advancedlaunch system for the rocket and all of those kinds of things. But thisis entirely consistent with the summit agreement and simply recognizesDOD's share of NASA.[S11MY8-208]{S5435}WARNERMr. WA<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>RN<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ER. Mr. President, I repeat that the NASA accountis not subject to the discretion of the Secretary of Defense and the $299.5billion was to give the Secretary of Defense a figure over which he wouldexercise discretion. <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>T<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>hat is the essence of the summit agreement.When I read_I understand there is no suggestion that I am in error_thatin the package the President and the leadership agree to carry out thisagreement: The Congress shall provide sufficient budget authority to theindividual Cabinet officers to achieve full levels of international anddomestic defense outlays_those are statements which clearly indicate theintent of that summit agreement.I also bring to the attention of my distinguished colleague that the budgetresolution, which as you well know is already out there, assumes a 27-percentincrease for NASA for fiscal year 1988 funding. The House-passed resolutionincludes a 20-percent increase for NASA. And that, of course, is matterstill in conference. And the defense spending is capped off at this figure,it represents a ^0.7 percent.So, it seems to me that discretion has been exercised already in favorof NASA. Some substantial increase in their overall spending will emergefrom this conference. Whereas defense will remain in the negative growthposture, <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>0<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>.7 percent.I thank the Chair.The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.[S11MY8-209]{S5435}EXONMr. EXON. Mr. President, maybe we can lay to rest once and for all theargument that is made by the Senator from Louisiana that this is a defenseneed. I wish that the Senator would understand that the Defense Departmenthas already spent billions of dollars on defense-related issues_and I realizeit is a defense-related is<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>s<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ue_that they have not got services rendered for.Therefore, what the Senator from Louisiana is proposing to do is to putsome more money down that rathole, without any immediate return with regardto national defense. I think it cannot be legitimately argued, if the amendmentoffered by the Senator from Louisiana was passed, that it would be fora legitimate national defense purpose.Which gets back to the argument made by the Senator from Virginia thatit is a disguised violation of the agreement that was made. I have gota whole series of figures on this. I just want to say that here are someof the costs that DOD has already paid.Four billion dollars for the replacement orbiter; $3.5 billion for thenow useless shuttle launch facility at Vandenber<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>g<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>; over $2 billion in the development of the now expendablelaunch <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>vehicle <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>to launch satellite programs; nine prepaid shuttleflights which represents $1 billion in advance payment to NASA already,by DOD.On and on. So, when the Senator speaks of DOD paying a fair share of th<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>e<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> recovery costs, I look at this list, which alreadyadds up to more than $10 billion already advanced to NASA by the DefenseDepartment. So I would simply say that I think that if anything, the amendmentoffered by the Senator from Wisconsin is more straightforward and I wouldhope that we would defeat both of these amendments when I make the tablingmotion.I yield the floor.The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.[S11MY8-210]{S5435}HEFLINMr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, I rise in strong opposition to the amendmentoffered by my colleague from Wisconsin Senator <CODE-213>5</CODE-213><T4><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>Proxmire, <CODE-213>5</CODE-213></T4><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>which is a <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>seco<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>nd degree amendment to the Johnston amendment. Ihave, from the very beginning, supported SDI for a number of reasons. Ihope to outline some of those in a few remarks that I will make.I, likewise, have supported the space program completely. I believe I wasthe first Senator to call on the President to initiate a program for apermanently manned space station. And I really think that the space stationhas tremendous potential, not only in space but for byproducts that itcould produce particularly in the area of medical research and materialsprocessing.However, the Johnston amendment puts me between a rock and a hard place;I will be forced to make a very difficult decision_that is choosing betweenadequate funding for space or funding for SDI. While the Johnston amendmentwould put badly needed funds into the Shuttle program <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>and<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> could free funds also badly <CODE-213>1</CODE-213>need<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ed<CODE-213>1</CODE-213> <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>for the spa<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ce<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> station, the amendment takes the money from SDI,another program which I greatly support. In that regard<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>,<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> the Johnston amendment is a particularly difficultamendment for me since it deals with two programs that I think have greatpotential.But let me direct my remarks at this time to the Proxmire amendment. Ithink you have to look at the Space Program <ITAG tagnum="80">to really give you proper perspective as to one phase of SDI. Thatis the success of the Space Program in producing valuable spinoffs andbyproducts.</ITAG>I do not think anyone today can challenge the fact that the Space Programhas many, many times paid for itself in economic enhancements to this country.Digital watches, for example, came out of the Space Program. Great advancementsin the field of computer science have come from the Space Program. Thesatellites t<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>hat <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>people are using in rural areas to view televisionwould not be possible if it had not been for the Space Program.I could go on and list a great many instances where spinoffs and byproductshave provided great benefits to the American people. There is no questionthat the Space Program has brought economic benefits that no one couldhave conceived of and predicted at the time that we entered into it.I think SDI has a similar potential in the future. It involves technologiesthat can produce tremendous economic benefits to the United States, regardlessof whether or not we ever have an SDI defensive program.I say this because it concentrates resources that are being directed towardcertain technologies that have a tremendous scientific and economic potential.One of the first bills that I introduced when I came to the Senate wasto create a National Laser Institute, to bring about the coordination ofthe development of laser technology and the many aspects of that technology,at that time.We were even thinking about laser-generated fusion.Today we see laser technology being used as a surgical scalpel to removecataracts from the human eye. There are those that predict that laser technologywill one day produce laser beams to clean out clogged arteries and veinsof the circulatory system and the heart and that open heart surgery, bypasssurgery, will be obsolete in a few years. As a result of laser technology, long-range projections have been madeby scientists <CODE-213>1</CODE-213>that <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>we can develop a propulsion system by which spacecraftcould be launched into space at a tremendous rate of speed far greaterthan what we could imagine to date. So you can see, lasers have a greatpotential and the SDI <CODE-213>1</CODE-213>Program <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>is devoting a good deal of resources to this excitingtechnology.Computer science, under the SDI Program, must advance tremendously. Wenow probably are somewhere between the fifth and sixth generation of computers.There are those who predict that, with the SDI Program, we can go to the9th and 10th generation of computers. The advancements in the area of computerscience, by concentrating on an SDI Program, also have tremendous potential.While I am not a scientist, Mr. President, it just makes a great deal ofsence to me to continue this exciting program which could yield many greatbenefits, both in commercial activities and defense technology.Then there is the area, which I am told by many scientists, has tremendousopportunities, and that is in the field of optics. These are all essentialin the SDI Program and they are being greatly advanced due to the ongoingSDI research.Mr. President, all of these are just a few areas that can be advanced asa result of our investment in SDI.Certainly today there is a large group of scientists that says SDI canbe successful as a defensive shield, and those arguments have been made.The Armed Services Committee has carefully considered those and are recommendinga good <CODE-213>1</CODE-213>funding <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>level for the SDI <CODE-213>1</CODE-213>Program.<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>I do not know whether or not it can be a perfect shield as those who haveadvocated it. I am not a scientist in that regard, I am not sure I canproperly evaluate it, but I think we are now at a stage of research wherewe need to continue to support SDI and support it vigorously.<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>In my <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>judgment, we are at a research stage today that Ithink in a few or more years, we will be in a situation to properly evaluatethe <CODE-213>1</CODE-213>status <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>and defensive possibilities of the SDI <CODE-213>1</CODE-213>Program. <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>But in the meantime, research into those areas oftechnology that can mean so much to the American people and to the economyof America ought to go forward to see if a defensive shield could someday,in the near future, be possible. So, Mr. President, I believe that we shouldnot cut back on <CODE-213>1</CODE-213>SDI's <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>research at this time.However, on the other hand, we see the great potential of space technology.There are so many great things that can come from space technology thatbenefit our <CODE-213>1</CODE-213>everyday <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>lives that we could not count them all. We oughtto build a space station, and we ought to move forward for the next fewyears certainly in the research area of SDI.The ALPS Program that Senator <T4>Nunn</T4> has spoken about also has tremendous potential. As we lookto the future, the real danger of a missile being launched against theUnited States probably, and I have to say probably because I do not know,would <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>more <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>likely come from a nation other than Russia. It wouldmore likely come from a <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>third <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>country or from a mad group of individuals such as<CODE-213>1</CODE-213>terrorists. <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>We will have to consider this. Certainly the ALPSProgram as conceived by Senator <T4>Nunn</T4> deserves considerable attention as we go forward with theevaluation of a strategic defense.With regard to SDI funding, we are in a situation of where the House hasalready cut SDI funding. In the floor debate in the House, they were sayingthat when you get to conference, the Senate will have a high figure andwe will end up splitting the difference or coming close to it. That thisis what has happened now almost every year in regard to the authorizationfor SDI funding.The House passed <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>a <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>SDI funding level for SDI that was about $3.5 billion.The Senate figure, out of committee, is $4.55 billion.So Mr. President, if we accept the Proxmire amendment, we will <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>cut <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>$700 million from the Senate Armed Service<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>s<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> Committee level, and we would then have a situationwhere we would go to conference with <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>a <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>SDI funding level much closer to the House level,thereby reducing our negotiating room and ending up with a lower totalfunding for the SDI <CODE-213>1</CODE-213>Program. <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>In my judgment, this would be a serious mistake.I feel like we ought to defeat the <CODE-213>1</CODE-213>Proxmire <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>amendment at this time. However, the Johnston amendmentcauses me a great deal of concern. At that stage, I am simply in a degreeof uncertainty about my position on it. In that regard, I want to studyit further. It involves the issues of allocation of funds that will goto subcommittees of the Appropriations Committee, and there are competingfactors there. This is a very complicated matter, but it is one that Iwant to give further study to.However, at this time, I urge the defeat of the <CODE-213>1</CODE-213>Proxmire <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>amendment.Mr. President, I yield the floor.[S11MY8-211]{S5436}SHELBYMr. SHELBY addressed the Chair.The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. <T4>Levin</T4>). The Senator from Alabama.[S11MY8-212]{S5436}SHELBYMr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the amendment offeredfirst by the Senator from Louisiana and the second degree amendment offeredto it by the Senator from Wisconsin.Let me begin by stating that NASA funding has been and will continue tobe a very high priority for this Senator.I could not imagine a more deserving recipient of additional funding.However, I do believe a transfer of funds from the Department of Defenseto another account should have been attempted during consideration of thebudget resolution, not during debate of the defense bill.The <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ad<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ministration's request for $4.84 billion for theprogram was thoroughly discussed by members of this <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>Co<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>mmittee on <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>Ar<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>med <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>Se<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>rvices. Working in a spirit of bipartisanship, theArmed Services Committee reported out a funding level of $4.55 billionfor SDI, a cut of about $300 million from the President's request.I believe that a funding level of $4.55 billion, $4.271 billion for defense,strikes a satisfactory balance between the need for healthy growth in thisprogram and the need to work within current budget constraints.The Soviets wish to stop us from proceeding with <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>our<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> SDI while they go forward with theirs. At this pointin time, however, the United States has absolutely no defense against nuclearattack. Nothing. Zero.One must remember that for many years now the Soviet Union has been investinghuge amounts of money on an extensive strategic defense effort of its own,an effort that appears to include the development, testing and deploymentof traditional ABM systems and components that could be expanded quicklyfor nationwide ABM defense purposes.The Soviets appear to be working toward the development of directed-energyweapons systems that can be used for strategic missile defense and to attackspace targets.General Secretary Gorb<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>e<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>chev, for his part, has good reason to oppose U.S.research into a strategic defense. He has made it clear that his main jobis to rescue the Soviet economy. He does not want to have to spend billionsof ru<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>bl<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>es on an even more sophisticated high-technologycompetition with our country. A competition in which our country alreadyhas a decided advantage. The Soviets are far behind the United States in the computer technologynecessary to develop the command, control and communications network necessaryto manage a whole system. All this notwithstanding, significant progress has been made in the SDI<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>Pr<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ogram. Kenetic energy weapons such as ERIS the exoatmosphericreentry vehicle interceptor subsystem and <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>HEDI<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>. The high endoatmospheric defense interceptor showexceptional promise. With this in mind, the Armed Services Committee hasput a floor on funding levels for ERIS and hedi as well as the advancedlaunch system and BSTS. The House, as has already been said, has reduced funding on SDI to $3.5billion. The Johnston amendment would put the Senate at $3.85 billion.We would come out of conference at around $3.7 billion, $200 million lessthan last year. Mr. President, permit me to quote from a report to Congress on the strategicdefense initiative, prepared by the strategic defense initiative organizationjust last month. The goal of the SDI Program has been and continues tobe and I quote: [S11MY8-213]{S5437}<ITAG tagnum="21">To conduct a vigorous research and technology program that could providethe basis for an informed decision regarding the feasibility of eliminatingthe threat posed by nuclear ballistic missiles of all ranges and increasingthe contribution of defens<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ive<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> systems to United States and allied security. </ITAG>The role of the strategic defense initiative could not be put more succinctly.The $4.55 billion approved by the Armed Services Committee for this programis the absolute minimum amount necessary to sustain progress already made.Anything less will serve only to increase total costs at the risk of nationalsecurity. Mr. President, I yield the floor. [S11MY8-214]{S5437}THURMONDMr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Proxmire and Johnstonamendments which would reduce the Armed Services Committee recommendedfunding level of $4.55 billion for the SDI Program by $700 million. TheJohnston amendm<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>en<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>t <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>transfers these <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>funds to the National Aeronautic<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>s<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> and Space Administration. As I understand it, theProxmire amendment would eliminate the item altogether, to which I am bitterlyopposed.Mr. President, in proposing that SDI funds be transferred to NASA, theamendment undermines the framework of the budget agreement that was sopainstakingly worked out by congressional leaders with the Administration,and which has been honored to the letter by the Senate and House ArmedServices Committees in making their recommendations.As Secretary of Defense Carlucci has recently written, the ``SDI is thecornerstone of our overall defense program. It holds the promise of a morestable and effective deterrent posture based on a balance of offense anddefense.'' I believe that the committee recommendation, which enjoyed strongbipartisan support, reflects Secretary Carlucci's characterization of theprogram.The Secretary, in putting together the amended fiscal year 1989 budgetrequest, has already reduced the program by $1.7 billion from the originalfiscal year 1989 request, and the Armed Services Committee reduced theDOD request by another $285 million. At the recommended level, I believethat the SDI program reflects a balance between security requirements andbudgetary constraints, and is a sound technical program.The SDI Program itself is also a balanced one. The program represents acareful balance between technology base research and validation experiments,between ground and space based systems, and between mature and advancedtechnologies. The greatest impact of funding <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>at<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> the level proposed by the amendment would be onplanned experiments which are essential to demonstrate concept feasibility.The amendment would seriously jeopardize the basis for a full scale developmentdecision which has been the focus of the program since its inception.Mr. President, the <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>Ho<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>use has authorized only $3.2 billion for the SDIProgram, a level supported by Chairman <T4>Aspin </T4>``as a negotiating maneuver prior to a conference with theSenate.'' This amendment would seriously undermine the Senate's abilityto achieve a reasonable level of funding for the SDI Program as a resultof conference, and I urge my colleagues to reject the amendment.[S11MY8-215]{S5437}LEVINMr. LEVIN addressed the Chair. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. <T4>Shelby</T4>). The Senator from Michigan. [S11MY8-216]{S5437}LEVINMr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I hope we will adopt the Johnston amendment.The issue of funding of SDI has become something of a numbers game in Congressand perhaps as a result we have lost sight of the relative priority whichis being placed on SDI. The committee recommendations for SDI funding makeSDI a very high-spending priority, far higher than can be warranted bythat program. The President's request for DOD/SDI funds constituted a 28-percentincrease over last year's level. The $4.6 billion recommended by the committeestill grants the DOD portion of SDI a 21.7-percent increase over last year'slevel. Now, this is in very sharp contrast to how other research and developmentprograms are fa<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>r<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ing in the President's budget. The aggregate Randamp;Dprograms of the three military services actually are sustaining a cut fromlast year's level. When you put the Randamp;D programs of the services together,what we find is in this budget there is actually a reduction in researchand development at the same time that we have an increase proposed by thePresident of 28 percent in SDI and by the committee of over 21 percent.We get national defense return on our research and development investmentin the Services. We need that development and we will get national defensereturn form an investment in the Shuttle Program as proposed in the Johnstonamendment. But what do we get for our investment in SDI? Given the numeroustechnical problems with the program which have been cited by the Officeof Technology Assessment in recent studies, the many unanswered questionsabout how the phased deployment of SDI will affect our security, and theserious ques<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ti<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>on about how the SDI office has handled the relationshipwith various advisory committees, I do not think we can justify providingthe SDI <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>p<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>rogram with a 21-percent increase in their currentbudget. First, a word on the technical problems. According to a report in the WashingtonPost, the OTA study made the following observations about the SDI <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>P<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>rogram. First, there has been little analysis ofany kind of space-based threats to the system survivability; in particular,the SDIO and its contractors have conducted no serious study of the situationin which the United States and the Soviet Union both occupy space withcomparable systems. Second, it appears that direct ascent nuclear antisatellite weapons wouldpose a significant threat to all three defense systems phases but particularlythe fir<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>s<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>t two.Third, in OTA's judgment, in the Office of Technology Assessment, therewould be a significant probability that the first and presumably only timeballistic missile defense systems are used in a real wa<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>r<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> it would suffer a catastrophic failure. In otherwords, OTA is reported as saying that the SDIO has not even analyzed whetherSDI deployment makes sense if the Soviets also deploy such a system, thatthe survivability of the first two phases of SDI is placed in serious doubtby a weapons system we first tested in the 1960's, that direct ascent nuclearantisatellite, and that it is significantly probable that this whole systemwill catastrophically fail if it is ever called upon to perform its mission.Is that the kind of a system that we should be providing a 21-percent increasein research and development funding for when we cannot even get the spaceshuttle off the ground, and when we have other higher priority defenseprograms that are going unfunded in this bill? I do not think so.Just one word about those advisory committees that the SDI is relying on.They have mishandled the advisory committee that they fund. We have a lawin this country that governs Federal advisory committees. It is calledFACA. FACA requires balanced advisory committees. It requires a charterfor each committee in<CODE-213>5</CODE-213> <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>order to keep track of them and to justify theircr<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>e<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ation. Our law requires minutes and recordkeepingfor those advisory committees. <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>It has salary limits on the people who belong tothose advisory committees. <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>It provides for an automatic 2-year termination ofthe committees. And it requires agencies to protect committees againstinappropriate influences by special interests.There is a patter<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>n<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> of noncompliance with our advisory committee lawwhen it comes to the SDI Office, and the SDI Program. First of all, thevery panels that advise the Department of Defense to set up SDI, the Fletcherand the Hoffman panels, were not formed nor did they operate in compliancewith our law. The Federal Advisory Committee Act was not complied withby the very panels that recommended the existence and the creation of theSDI Program. And the people who were participating in that were so informedby the DOD general counsel's office, and they were told not to circumventFACA. They were told it was improper to do so, but they did so anyway.Those panels were set up in noncompliance with FACA despite the recommendationof the general counsel's office of the Department of Defense.Then, after the SDI Office was created, there as a panel on the lethalityand a panel on kinetic energy. These are the very people who are advisingthe SDI presumably independently and objectively on what they should bedoing. Those panels were not formed in compliance with or law.<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>After our inquiry, the head of the SDI Program acknowledged that they shouldhave been chartered and he terminated them.Then there is another group called the Eastport group. They are the oneswho advise the SDI Office on battle management and on computers. Afterour inquiry, again the SDI Office decided to stop their funding and theyare now reviewing whether or not the Eastport group should have been charteredunder FACA. And may I tell the Chair and my colleagues that the preliminarydecision of the DOD staff is that it should have been chartered, and theGeneral Services Administration says it should have been chartered.How about the SDI Advisory Committee, the only advisory committee thatthe SDIO has chartered properly under FACA? They in turn are not even followingthe rules. When you look at the one advisory committee that they have formedin compliance with our advisory law, our advisory committee law, all 12of the appointees of that committee began to serve prior to filing of theirfinancial disclosure forms, all 12 began their service prior to the reviewof those forms, all 12 began prior to the filing of their disqualificationforms, 3 of the 12 do not even have a current appointment, and 6 of the12 have not filed the proper disqualification forms. This was despite allof the potential conflicts of interest that exist, conflicts of interestthat are so right that some people who have been appointed to these panelshave refused to serve.David Parnas, a professor who was appointed to the Eastport Panel, finallywrote to the head of the SDIO saying that:[S11MY8-217]<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>{S5438}<CODE-213>5</CODE-213><ITAG tagnum="21">The panel on which you have asked me to serve is not appropriatelyconstituted, clearly chartered, or adequately informed. There are betterways to manage research.</ITAG>This is what he pointedly told us then back in 1985. ``During the firstsittings of our panel, I could see the dollar figures dazzling everyoneinvolved. Almost everyone that I know sees in the SDI a new pot of goldjust waiting to be tapped,'' and he decided to resign from that panel.So put together two facts: First, the technical problems that exist withSDI, and the fact that SDIO has repeatedly been in noncompliance with theFederal Advisory Committee Act, the act which is supposed to give us somekind of confidence that the people that advise us are representing thepublic interest and not their private interests; that are supposed to giveus some assurance that there will not be self-dealing and use of insideinformation, some guarantees that there will not be conflict of interest.That act has not been complied with by any of the advisory committees representingthe SDI Program. Is this the program that should be given a 21-percentincrease in its funding? I think not.I think there are much better uses of the funds, and that is why I hopethat we will support the Johnston amendment.[S11MY8-218]<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>{S5438}<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>EXONMr. EXON addressed the Chair.The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Gibbons,the Director of the Office of Technology Assessment, U.S. Congress. I felt, in response to the able Senator from Michigan, that I should presentthis letter to set the record straight. [S11MY8-231]{S5439}QUAYLEMr. QUAYLE. Mr. President, what we have before us are two amendments, oneby the Senator from Wisconsin and the other by the Senator from Louisiana.I think both amendments are essentially the same. They are going to cutSDI by $700 million. I think the senior Senator from Wisconsin, whom we will miss in the future,has the direct approach. There is no smoke and mirrors about it. It justsays: ``We want $700 million less.''With respect to the Senator from Louisiana, there is maybe a sleight ofhand, that technically, somehow, this is in the budget summit, but it isnot. We are taking from one, Department of Defense, and giving to anotherdepartment, nondefense. I think both amendments do one thing. It would reduce SDI below what wespent and what we committed to last year. Last year, we were 3.9. Thiswould take us down to 3.8, the actual reduction, and you might as wellconsign SDI to the graveyard if these amendments are adopted. I think thatis perhaps the intent. Certainly, many people in this body are very much opposed to SDI. I amvery supportive of the strategic defense initiative. It is very interesting,Mr. President, that as we listened to the debate over the years on thestrategic defense initiative, it has gone something like this: We do notreally want to get into any kind of SDI Program that has this near perfectumbrella, that we have a perfect shield, that that is pie in the sky andway into the next century. I advocated that argument when it first cameout. I said the definition ought to be redefined, and we should focus onwhat we can do in the near term. Many of the critics joined those in supportof strategic defense, and we got to looking to what we could do in thenear term with respect to research and development and, ultimately, deployment.There have been discussions with respect to all sorts of near-term optionswe might have. Now we have the same critics say: ``We are not sure we really want to doin the near term anything other than Randamp;D, and let's Randamp;D it forever.''If you have research and development forever, you are not going to haveany strategic defenses. We should ask ourselves whether we should pursue the possibility of havingstrategic defenses or not. I happen to believe, and I think anybody whowill step back a moment and observe where we are going in the area of armscontrol, where we are going in the relationship of how our military securityis going to be provided in the near future, will come to the logical conclusionthat our objectives are manyfold. But we have one objective, to reducethe number of offensive weapons_that is, the INF agreement, the recentdiscussion of START, the recent study by Clay and Wolstetter, saying thatconventional forces can full<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>fill <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>some strategic missions, that the handwriting ison the wall, that we are going to look at a reduction in nuclear weaponsas an objective and still maintain peace, security, and stability. Another objective in this kind of equation is that we should be lookingat some defensive capabilities. There is nothing wrong with having strategicdefenses. There is nothing wrong with saying let us have a proper balanceof reduction in offensive weapons and introduction of defensive capabilitiesthat will provide for a more stable world in the future. <CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213><CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213><CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>I do not know why we want to turn our back on havingsome defensive options in the future. It is not a matter of catching upwith the Soviet Union, which in fact has spent more on strategic defensesthan they have on strategic offenses. It is not the idea of catching upwith the Soviet Union in trying to have engineers involved in looking forlasers and having 10,000 people working in a program like that. We aresimply doing what is in our national security interests, and what is inour national security interests is that we must look at the possibilityof deploying strategic defenses<CODE-213>1</CODE-213>.<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>You can look at the strategic defenses that wouldbe used, whether it be an accidental launch, whether it would be potentiallyfrom a Third World country, if they would get some ICBM capability, oryou could look at a limited attack from the Soviet Union<CODE-213>1</CODE-213>.<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>I have never been one of those people who believesin a bolt out of the blue, that the Soviet Union is going to unleash alltheir weapons.

Can we not do better than sayingwe are going to provide for peace for this generation and future generationsby only having offensive nuclear weapons and not having a defensive capability,not having any defensive capability against ballistic missiles, none, zero?We know the Soviets have that<CODE-213>1</CODE-213>.<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>I think that we ought to go down that road so wecan have those options of deploying some defense<CODE-213>1</CODE-213>.<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>As a matter of fact, I think it would be a far betterworld and much more stable if we had some defenses rather than just relyingon offensive weapons for peace and security<CODE-213>1</CODE-213>.<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>I can think just about 2 years ago when a <T3>Yankee </T3>class submarine of the Soviet Union sunk off the coastof Bermuda about 1,200 miles from our shore. There was a fire and the submarinesunk. If you take the hypothetical situation, if that fire had gotten outof control and had gotten in the ballistic missile place and the ballisticmissiles had gotten lose, even if Gorbachev had gotten on the hotline andsaid, ``Here are the coordinates; here is where it is going to land. Anythingelse you want to know,'' and the President would say, ``Thank you,'' youknow what, America, we could not do a darn thing about it, except takethe hit even if it was an accidental launching from that submarine thatsank off the coast of Bermuda<CODE-213>1</CODE-213>.<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>We do not have any ballistic missile defense. I cantell you, the Proxmire and the Johnston amendment will make sure we donot even have any strategic defense system.Now I think it is about time that we get away and try to improve upon thedoctrine and the strategy of a mutual assured destruction that says <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>that <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>for peace and security of this country we are onlygoing to have offensive nuclear weapons and it is time that we make aninvestment in strategic defenses, strategic defenses that will providefor the peace and security of this country.I submit both of these amendments do essentially the same thing. Althoughthe Johnston amendment is sort of clearly drafted saying it does not breachthe summit, both breach the summit. It is a cut of $700 million. It isbelow what we spent last year. If we start to go below what we spent asI said you may as well confine this to the graveyard.(The following colloquy occurred earlier and appears in the <T4>Record</T4> at this point by unanimous consent:)[S11MY8-232]{S5440}NUNNMr. NUNN.

The Senator's time has expired.The Senator from Georgia.[S11MY8-266]{S5440}NUNNMr. NUNN. Mr. President, I will take less than my 2 minutes. I agree withthe arguments that have been made by the Senator from Nebraska, the Senatorfrom Virginia, and the Senator from Indiana. I believe we should tablethe Proxmire amendment.The budget summit conference last year did not bind every individual Senator,but I believe that we would have a very difficult time getting anotheragreement with the President on overall fiscal policy relating to taxes,relating to defense, relating to social programs, if, indeed, we go belowthe overall agreement on defense that was made last year.In addition, I also believe that we are in a situation where the Househas made major cuts in the SDI Program. If we want to come out of confer<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>en<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ce with a sensible program, I think it is very importantthat we pres<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>e<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>rve the Senate level of funding at this stage whichinevitably will have to come down in conference. We all know that. So Iurge the defeat of the amendment.[S11MY8-267]{S5441}PROXMIREMr. PROXMIRE. Mr. President, the distinguished Senator from Indiana saidwe would consign SDI to the graveyard if we pass my amendment. Well, myamendment is for $3.85 billion. Very few research programs have ever hadthat for a year. Altogether, we have spent well over $15 billion. It wouldbe something like $18 billion on that one program before we finish.Mr. President, let us keep in mind that what the Proxmire amendment doesis simply change the Johnston amendment. Then we would have a vote, ifmy amendment should succeed, on whether or not to defeat or pass that amendment.So what my amendment does is say, let us make this clear-cut; let us dowhat we have done in the past; let us simply cut SDI. We have done thatin the past and many Senator voted for it.I am simply asking that we make a reduction back roughly to the level thatit is now, a very, very high level, and we recognize what Senator <T4>Johnston </T4>has said so eloquently and Senator <T4>Bumpers </T4>also, that this is a program that, on the basis of thebest scientific expert advice we can get, is almost certain not to be deployedand not to work.Mr. President, I yield the floor.[S11MY8-268]{S5441}SPECTERMr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I am voting against the amendment by Senator<T4>Proxmire </T4>to reduce SDI spending by $700 million and against theamendment by Senator <T4>Johnston </T4>to transfer $700 million from SDI to NASA because I believeit is important at this time to support the President's program on SDIas he prepares for the summit with General Secretary Gorbachev in Moscowlater this month.In general, I support funding for SDI because I believe that it holds realisticpromise to provide significant defense capability against ballistic missilesalthough I have in the past, as the <T4>Record </T4>shows, voted for moderate expenditures on SDI.In my view, our SDI Program has been a significant factor in bringing theSoviet Union to the bargaining table and an inducement for signficant Sovietconcessions on arms control including strategic arms reduction.With the upcoming summit in Moscow later this month, I believe the Congressshould strengthen the President's negotiating hand. Accordingly, I haveopposed reducing the SDI funding levels at this time.<CODE-213>5</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213><CODE-213>5</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213><CODE-213>5</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213><CODE-213>5</CODE-213>The<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Alabama.[S11MY8-283]{S5441}HEFLINMr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, the President's budget calls for only adequatefunds for the space station for fiscal year 1989. I say adequate becauseit is substantially reduced from the funding level planned by NASA. Thisis due to a <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>c<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ongressional reduction in NASA's fiscal year 1988request last year.In order to meet the budget summit figures and to provide for the spacestation in the President's budget, OMB had to cut certain other programs.The programs that they cut were elderly housing, homeless programs, communitydevelopment programs, waste treatment construction grant money, and assistedhousing.This would allow for the increases that would, if the President's budgetpassed as requested, go to space which would have included the space station.I think that it would be realist<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ic<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> to say that none of those programs are going toend substa<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>n<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>tially cut. In that regard, those program<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>s<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> are put in competition for funding with the shuttleand the space station.Mr. President, I have a great amount of <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>respect <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>for our friends and colleagues who serve on the AppropriationsCommittees. They have their own budget view and priorities. <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>A<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>s for myself, I support the SDI research as the Presidentrequested it. I support the space program at the level of funding the Presidentrequested. In that regard I am between a rock and a hard place as to whereto come down on this issue. Since I learned of the amendment of the distinguishedSenator from Louisiana, I have thought long and hard.Due to the budget problems that we face, I am extremely fearful that ifthe Johnston amendment does not carry, there <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>m<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ay not be funding for the space station this year.I say this after <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>looking <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>at the figures which the HUD-Independent <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>A<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>gencies <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>A<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ppr<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>o<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>priat<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ion<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>s <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>S<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ubcommittee has had <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>to <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>deal with th<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>is<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> year. As we all know, this is the subcommittee <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>that <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>funds NASA programs.Within the HUD-Independent Agencies, there is a great amount of competitionthat exists relative to the allotment of fun<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>d<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>s to the different <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>s<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ubcommittees. Whether or not the space station movesforward, or even <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>survives, <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>this year depends on the allocation to the HUD<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>-Independent Agencies <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>Subcommittee.I have spoken on many occasions about the great advantages of the spacestation. But from a realistic viewpoint, I am seriously concerned thatwithout the Johnston amendment, the Space Station Program will not be fundedor will be funded at such a low level that it will be prevented from gettingstarted.<CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213><CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213><CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213><CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213><CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213><CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>On the other hand, the way the Johnston amendmentis arranged, the overall DOD finding for SDI remain<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>s<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> at $4.2 billion.

Mr. President, when the budget summit agreement was reachedlast year, Secretary Carlucci cut SDI by $1.7 billion. <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>T<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>he administration sent a proposal to the Congressfor a $4.8 billion total in<CODE-213>5</CODE-213> fiscal year<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> 1989. That was cut in the Armed Services Committeeto $4.55 billion. This amendment will cut it to $3.8 billion. The Househas provided $3.4 billion so that if this amendment is accepted, one thingis for certain, we will not spend more than $3.8 billion for SDI next year.We will have cut SDI below the current level. Now, I say to those who say we have to help NASA, and I am going to talkabout that in a minute, we are not necessarily helping NASA here. The onlything that is binding in conference is that we shall not spend more than$3.8 billion on SDI.Now, the House has already cut SDI to $3.4 billion, and they proceededto spend the money on every add-on you can imagine. So when we go to conferenceit is those add-ons against NASA. I remind my colleagues what this Congress has done to the space and sciencebudget. Last year we cut it by $700 million. This year the House cut thePresident's space budget by $1.4 billion. Did they do it to invest in loweringthe deficit? No. They cut funding for the next generation of America andinvested in the next election. And who can believe, if we<CODE-213>5</CODE-213> <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>come in and cut SDI here, that in conference we arenot going to see the same old pork-barrel politics that we have seen inthe past. I am a strong supporter of NASA. I think it is an absolute outrage whathappened last year in the budget and in the Appropriations Committee. Afterwe adopted the budget the <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>A<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ppropriations <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>C<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ommittee came in with a low 302(b) allocations andattempted to take more money out of space and science and put more moneyinto the social programs. So we are going to have an opportunity to vote on NASA, and I am goingto vote for full funding. If those 302(b) allocations come to the floorand we have cut NASA below the budget, I for one am going to offer an amendmentto change those allocations. I do not know whether it will pa<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>s<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>s or not, but that is when we are going to be debatingthe space budget. Today we are debating SDI, an investment in science,an investment in technology.The distinguished Senator from Louisiana has been consistent. He has votedto cut SDI every single year. He wants to cut it. This year he came upwith a new wrinkle. The new wrinkle was that Congress has been cheatingspace, cheating science, and he said, ``Well, let us cut SDI. We will promiseit to space and then it will be another matter when we get down to seewhat the 302(b) allocations are.''I urge my colleagues to reject this amendment and then let us vote to havefull funding for space and science. We have it within our power to do that.If we have a majority that is willing to fund it by taking money away fromthe beekeepers' indemnity fund and weed research in North Dakota and allthe other so-called items that we funded in last year's supplemental, ifwe are willing to do those things, we can have SDI and we have the NASAfunding. Finally, let me say to my colleague, a deal was made on the bu<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>d<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>get. I did not think much of the deal. I though<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>t<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> it was a bad deal because spending which grew lastyear by only 1.4 percent now grows by 4.5 percent. That is not what I thinkof as fiscal responsibility. But part of the deal was that we agreed ona defense figure. Now this amendment comes along with a sleight of hand and seeks to violatethat agreement.

Point number two, Mr. President. By this amendment do wecut this down to $3.85<CODE-213>5</CODE-213> billion<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>? The answer is no. If you will look at page 25 ofthis bill, it says that the Department of Defense for S<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>D<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>I research gets $4.271 billion. That figure remainsin here. Now, it comes up to $4.639 billion when you add DOE and MilCon.That figure will go to conference. You do not go to conference with $3.85billion. What my amendment says is that of that amount you shall spend$700 million for NASA-related activities.Now, are those proper expenditures for the Department of Defense? Let meread from the appropriation report of 1987. It says as follows:[S11MY8-303]{S5443}<ITAG tagnum="21">The committee's recommendation to fund the replacement orbiter inthis bill recognizes the critical dependence on the space shuttle systemto meet national security mission demands and balance launch system requirements.</ITAG>Critical national security depends on the space shuttle.

The Senator from Nebraska.[S11MY8-305]{S5443}EXONMr. EXON. Mr. President, let me try to summarize this, if I might.The case made by the Senator from Louisiana for why and how much the Departmentof Defense should reimburse NASA for recovery costs simply does not holdwater. I read earlier to the Senate a list of all the expenditures thatthe Department of Defense has made to the shuttle program which adds upto about $10 billion. The total Air Force costs through 1995 for the recoveryprogram of space launch capabilities is $12 billion. These are all coststhat DOD will bear with no contribution by NASA.Since NASA now plans to use a number of the expendable launch vehiclesthat the Air Force has developed, I wonder how much of this $12 billionthe Senator from Louisiana would like NASA to pay DOD of its share of theadded costs that DOD has had to bear.In sum, Mr. President, this amendment has nothing to do with the SpaceLaunched Recovery Program.

Mr. President, there is no secret.This will fund the space station. That is that intent of it. It funds thespace station out of SDI money, and it does so because of the criticalnational security relationship between both the space station and the shuttlebecause the space station and the shuttle and the entire NASA Program are,of course, in the NASA budget in HUD and Indpendent Agencies. There isnothing hidden about that agenda. It is right up front.<CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>Let me tell you, it is going to be very difficultunder any circumstances to get that space station going. <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>I<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> am for it.<CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>This is a way to do it, a way consistent with thedefense budget because it does have defense implications. I think our accountingis right for the $700 million. I think there are 15 of the 52 launcheswhich are DOD related. I do not think they are already paid for. But thataccounting problem is endless. Suffice it to say th<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>a<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>t we check our accounting with NASA. Maybe they area party in interest here although the administration is officially againstthis. According to NASA that is the right way to account for it. But thisis really bigger than the accounting because we are not bound by whateveraccounting. The fact is there is a definite direct defense interest inNASA, and in the space station. It is a higher priority than a $700 millionadd-on to SDI. By the way, in the past, I have never been for an SDI cut.<CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>Every amendment which I have put in here increasesSDI.

The time of the Senator fromLouisiana has expired.[S11MY8-308]{S5443}GOREMr. GORE. Mr. President, I have a brief statement to make for the purposeof explaining why I shall not <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>be <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>voting in favor of amendments to reduce SDI funding,whether for the purpose of transfe<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>rr<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ing the funds to NASA, or simply not spending themat all.My opposition to SDI is unchanged. Like others here, I regard the $13 billionthus far spent on this program as largely wasted. Like others here, I amacutely aware of other priorities which are in danger of failing for wantof funds; and th<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>is<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> includes the space station, which I support.In the past, I have supported efforts to move money out of SDI on the Senatefloor.However, this year the Senate Armed Services Committee has voted to grosslyunderfund the small ICBM Program. I regard this missile as a basic elementfor strategic stability and as a building block for ar<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ms<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> control.It is my hope that <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>th<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>is will be corrected in conference. But if that isto happen, then the pot of money repres<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>en<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ted by SDI_and for that matter, by garrison basedrail mobile MX_must come to conference intact. If this money is reallocatedhere on the Senate floor to other priorities, it will not be availablefor bargaining among the conferees.Granted, there is no guarantee that conference will work out as I hope.But that is the risk we all take when we make decisions on votes that involveour basic objectiv<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>es<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> and the strategies we think may lead to outcomeswe think important.Therefore, in this vote and on others which would break apart the SenateArmed Servic<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>es<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> Committee's strategic spending package, to the detrimentof the small ICBM I shall vote in support of the package.

Rather, because I want to protectthe chance for a better allocation of resources in conference.<CODE-213>5</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213><CODE-213>5</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213><CODE-213>5</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>[S11MY8-309]{S5444}BENTSENMr. BENTSEN. Mr. President, I want to join in supporting the amendmentof the distinguished Senator from Louisiana [Mr. <T4>Johnston</T4>] and I want to commend him for offering this way of strengtheningAmerica's space program.This amendment provides substantial funds for the SDI Program while recognizingthe fact that that program, like many other vital defense activities, dependson access to space. It also is consistent with previous congressional actionrequiring the Pentagon to foot part of the bill for the Space Shuttle Program.Without a viable shuttle program, without the eventual space station, ournational security would face dangerous risks. Space is an American frontierfor security, for scientific research, and for commercial development.Thus, it is most appropriate for the defense budget to pay a fair shareof the cost of restoring the shuttle to regular flight operations. Thenondefense portion of the budget should not have to bear the whole burden.As the distinguished sponsor of this amendment has said, some 29 percentof the planned shuttle flights through 1993 are already assigned to militarymissions, and this amendment would assign $700 million because that figureis 28 percent of the shuttle recovery cost. That seems fair to me.Mr. President, this amendment also gives the Senate an opportunity to speakup for a strong space program. It lets us send a powerful signal to theAppropriations Committee that we want an expanded space and science programsuch as that recommended by the President. We do not want NASA to be victimizedby opponents of the space station or other manned space flight programs.I have been deeply concerned, as have several of my colleagues, about theprospect of inadequate allocations under the <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>Bu<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>dget <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>Ac<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>t to the HUD and Independent Agencies Subcommitteeof Appropriations. If that occurs, NASA and the National Science Foundationcould be unjustifiably squeezed, and the space station could face cancellation.This amendment would reduce the pressure on those budget activities byrequiring the Defense Department to pay a reasonable share of shuttle recoverycosts.Mr. President, I believe that the SDI Program permitted by this amendmentwould be robust and fully capable of exploring the many technologies whichmust be studied before any decision can be made on possible deploymentof a ballistic missile defense system. The issue is not whether we favora substantial SDI <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>Pr<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ogram but whether we favor a strong space program.[S11MY8-310]{S5444}EXONMr. EXON.

Mr. President, I wish to submit for the <T4>Record </T4>a statement which will clear up the situation surroundingthe right of a Senator to suggest the absence of a quorum. Article I, section5 of the Constitution states that to do business a majority shall constitutea quorum. Thus it is a constitutional right of any Senator before the Senatedoes any business to demand that a quorum be present.In addition Senate procedure on pages 833 through 867 enumerates the precedentssurrounding this right. There is no question that a quorum call was inorder before the call of the roll on the motion to table the motion toreconsider the vote by which the Johnston amendment was tabled, a factwhich I am told the Par<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>l<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>iamentarian has confirmed.The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Each one of the cosponsors of the amendment, of course,will want to speak. I would certainly be willing to enter into a 2-hourtime agreement.

Mr. President, I rise today to mark the birthday of one ofthe greatest living musicians of our century: Irving Berlin. Last July,I introduced a resolution honoring him, and I am pleased to note that thisresolution passed the Senate by unanimous consent on October 30, 1987.I am even more heartened today to be able to send him the good wishes ofthis body on <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>h<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>is 100th birthday. A century of music, indeed.Mr. Berlin emigrated from Russia<CODE-213>5</CODE-213> <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>with his family at the age of 5, and bec<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>a<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>me a resident of th<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>e<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> Lower East <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>S<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ide of New York City. His father died when he was8 years old and Mr. Berlin was forced to leave school to contribute tothe support of his family. Because of his love for singing and music, Mr.Berlin began his career singing on the streets and collecting whateverchange he could get. At the age of 17, Mr. Berlin obtained a job as a singingwaiter at the Pelham Cafe in downtown New York. It was during his stintat the Pelham Cafe that Mr. Berlin's talent was first recognized and hewas commissioned to write what would be his first hit song in 1909, ``Dorando.''His career escalated from there to make him the success he has become today.There are few who could claim the lifetime achievements of Mr. Berlin.He has written the music and lyrics for over 900 songs, 19 musicals, and18 movies. He had his first hit in 1909, wrote h<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>is<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> first musical in 1916, and has not stop<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>p<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ed writing since. As recently as 1962, he came outwith the musical ``Mr. President.''The number of hits Mr. Berlin has had is astounding. He has written songssuch as ``Oh, How I Hate <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>T<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>o Get Up in the Morning,'' ``Cheek to Cheek,'' and``Puttin' on the Ritz,'' among others. He has also written the scores for``Annie Get Your Gun,'' ``Top Hat.'' But perhaps the song he has receivedthe most recognition for is ``God Bless America,'' for which he receivedthe Congressional Gold Medal from President Eisenhower in 1955. This songhas become our unofficial national anthem.Irving Berlin has entertained America with his songs for over three-quartersof a century. His music has become symbolic of the American spirit justas his life is symbolic of the American <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>d<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ream_he is a success in the field he loves.

Mr. President, let me just say for the information of peoplewho might not have known what was going on here the last few minutes, theamendment that I offered was sort of superseded by the amendment of theSenator from Vermont, Mr. <T4>Leahy, </T4>and it was admittedly designed to fill up the tree. Butwe concluded, after we did it, that it was not all that important. Whathis amendment does, so everybody here will understand, it simply changesabout three words in my amendment to give it some consistency.I do not want to go into a belabor<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ed<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> explanation of it, but we had used the ph<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ra<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>se <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>``<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>MIRV<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>'<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>d systems<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>''<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> twice which made our amendment slightly inconsistent.It would not have been fatal. It was not a really big deal. But just tobe consistent and to make it read right, we changed it. That is all theLeahy amendment does. So nobody need to be looking for any hidden tricksas to what the <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>Lea<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>hy amendment does.Having said that, let me say that on the defense authorization bill itjust seems we have these amendments we have to ritualistically offer everyyear, such as SDI and such as this amendment.Last October 2, the Senate voted 57 to 41 to continue observing the sublim<CODE-213>5</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>its of the SALT II Treaty. We had a good debate onit and the Senate overwhelmingly voted to continue. Even though that wasan unratified treaty and even though the word ``SALT'' is apparently thedirtiest word you can say to the President or anybody in the White House,that is what we did.Now<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>,<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> if the White House is hung up on the word ``SALT;''that does not bother me. The reason we are offering this for the fifthconsecutive year_and I might say the Senate for the previous 4 years hasvoted almost overwhelmingly for some constraints on the nuclear arms race_allwe are offering this amendment for is to say the INF Treaty is fine. Weare all for it. It will not have 20 votes against it in this body.Second, we have been trying to negotiate a really substantial reductionin nuclear weapons with the Soviet Union under the START Treaty. We nowknow and everybody says that we cannot possibly reach an agreement by thetime the President goes to Moscow. I do not know when we will reach anagreement. But <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>I<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> want to say that unless we do reach an agreementsoon<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>,<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> we need some kind <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>of <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>restrain<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>t<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> on both the United States and the Soviet Union inthis continuing escalation of the arms race.For the record and the benefit of anybody who may be listening, the sublimitsthat we have voted on in the past here are these under the SALT II Treaty:Ei<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>t<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>her side is limited to 820 MIRV<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>'<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>d ICBM's. Both sides_and I am talking about an unratifiedtreaty SALT II_both sides were limited to 820 MIRV<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>'<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>d ICBM's such as we have in silos out West, the MinutemanIII, principally.No. 2, both sides were limited to 1,200 missiles, MIRV<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>'<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>d missiles, that is, ICBM's and SLBM's. That meansthe kind that sit in the silos out West plus the missiles on our submarines_1,200.You can mix them up just about any way you want to.For example, we have 550 MIRV<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>'<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>d ICBM's. The Soviets have 803 as of right now. Butwe make up the difference between 550 and 1,200 with submarine missiles,which incide<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>n<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>tally happens to be my favorite deterrent to theSoviet Union.The third category, of course, was all MIRV<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>'d<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> systems which includes ICBM<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>'s<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>, submarine-launched ballistic missiles and bombersthat carry the cruise missile. So, here were the limits: 820 MIRV<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>'d<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> ICBM's, 1,200 combination of MIRV<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>'d<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> ICBM's and SLBM's and 1,320 ICBM submarine-launchedand bomber-carrying cruise missiles. In 1980, during the campaign, candidate Reagan said he did not like theSALT Treaty; that it was fatally flawed. In 1982, he said he had changedhis mind and that as long as the Soviet Union maintained a compliance withthe numbers in that unratified treaty so would we. That was the situation until late November 1986 when President Reagan saidwe are no longer going to comply with what we call our no-undercut policy;that is, we are no longer going to comply with the numerical limits ofthe treaty. So the Senator from Pennsylvania, Mr. <T4>Heinz, </T4>the Senator from Rhode Island, Mr. <T4>Chafee, </T4>and the Senator from Vermont, Mr. <T4>Leahy, </T4>and I got together in a bipartisan spirit and came to theSenate and said, ``We think this is bad business.''Last October 2, this Senate voted 57 to 41 to continue complying with thoseSALT II limi<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ts<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>. The House had already voted to do the same thing.So you had the House and the Senate both saying, ``Mr. President, don'texceed the limits. No money herein may be used to exceed the limits.''The President threatened to veto the bill. And to his credit, the distinguishedSenator from Georgia, Mr. <T4>Nunn, </T4>called me and stayed in close touch with me during the timethe Senate and the House were in conference. He said, ``We would like toget this bill signed. The President will not sign it as it is presentlydrafted. Here is what we are proposing.'' And he gave me their proposal.While I did not like it, and my colleagues who had fought with me on thisdid not like it, we agreed to it. We were interested in getting a billpassed, too. And so here is what the conference said last year when they tinkered withit just a little bit. It did allow us and the Soviet Union both to exceedthe 1,320 limit, but not by a lot. And it certainly kept some wraps onthe nuclear arms race. Here it what the conferees said when they did this.And I want to read this into the <T4>Record, </T4>Mr. President.[S11MY8-477]{S5451}<ITAG tagnum="21">The conferees note that decisions taken for budgetary reasons elsewherein the bill will have the effect of stabilizing U.S. strategic forces duringfiscal year 1988 at roughtly the level deployed as of the date of enactmentof the bill.

Incidentialy, justfor anybody who does not study this, I will give you an interesting statistic.Let me assume that when the ninth Trident submarine goes to sea this fall_weare not going to <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>do<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> this, but may we do it later, but just for argumentpurposes_let me assume when the ninth Trident submarine goes to sea thisfall, we put new Trident II missile on it and we put 10 warheads on eachone of those missiles. The Trident II submarine has 24 missiles. If youput 10 warheads on each missile, that is 240.You know, this is not a part of our SIOP, I am sure. I am not privy towhat our SIOP is. But if the Soviet Union should launch a preeemptive strikeagainst the United States that destroyed all 550 of our ICBM's in theirsilos out west, destroyed every <CODE-213>5</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>B-52 bomber we have that could possibly reach theSoviet Union, destroyed every F-11 we have in England that could possiblystrike the Soviet Union, dest<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ro<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>yed every aircraft carrier in the Mediterranean thathad a pla<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ne <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>on board that is nuclear wired, destroyed every singlesubmarine we had ex<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>cep<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>t just that one little Trident submarine, the ninthone, this fall, that Trident submarine has the potential ability to destroyevery city in the Soviet Union of over 100,000 people.When it comes to overkill, we have the ability to destroy the Soviet Unionperhaps 48 times and they have a comparable ability to destroy the UnitedStates, a similar number of times.When one lies down on a pillow at night, if he reflects on that at allfor any period of time, it might cost a night's sleep. But my point isthis. Pursuant to what the conference did last year, which gave u<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>s a<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> decided advantage over the Soviet Union, here isessentially where we are right now. You see, what the conference did is some erosion of the arms control process.Right now the United States has 1,336 MIR<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>V<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>'<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>d<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> systems_MIR<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>V<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>'<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>d<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> missiles and bombers with cruise missiles. Incident<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>al<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ly, I found it curious that the debate around herefor years was that the B-52 ought to be retired and we ought to build theB-1, then everybody wanted the Stealth. But the important thing was ourpilots were flying in airplanes that we<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>re<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> older than they were.If I have heard the argument on this floor once, I have heard it 1,000times. Our pilots are flying airplanes older than they are. So when thePresident says we are not going to co<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>m<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ply with the SALT II Treaty any longer, we are goingto trash it, how did he choose to trash it? He chose to put cruise missileson those B-52 bombers.If he had said we are going to build an extra Trident submarine, or weare going to put some more ICBM's in silos, that might have made a littlesense. But those old B-52G's, B-52H's, and now we have about 161 B-52 bomber<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>s<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> equipped with cruise missiles, so that they arenow co<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>u<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>nt<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ed<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> in this MIRV'<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>d<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> system. They count as a MIRV'<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>d<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> system when you put cruise missiles on them.They d<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>o<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> not count in this 1,320 number unless you put cruisemissiles on them. But I thought that was a curious way to trash the treaty.But here I go again. The Soviet Union <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>right now, these figures could vary a few, one wayor the other, but right now the Soviet Union has 1,270 MIRV'd launchersand bombers. The United States <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>has 1,336. We are not only 16 above the SALT II limits,we are about 66 above the Soviet Union.The bean counters, and there are a lot of them in the Senate, I hear themtalk all the time about how the Soviets have more tanks and guns and planesand everything else than we have_now here is one for you. Just since lastOctober when we voted on this thing we have added enough MIRV'<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>d<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> launchers that we now have 1,336 and the SovietUnion has 1,270. If that will help you sleep at night, to know that wehave that many more then they do, be my guest.But what this amendment does, Mr. President, it says that none of the fundsherein may be used to exceed the limits that we were at on January 25.Why January 25? Well, it is sort of sentimental. That is the day the Presidentsent the INF Treaty to the Senate. And I picked that day because if youare going to talk about reducing nuclear weapons under the INF Treaty,why torpedo the whole concept by continuing to add long-range strategicweapons?So, Mr. President, this is not a complicated amendment. It says that wewill stay whe<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>r<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>e we were on January 25, and if the President atany time in the next fiscal year certifies to us that the Soviet Unionis abo<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>v<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>e that, he can do whatever he wants to. All he hasgot to do is to cer<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>t<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>i<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>f<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>y to Congress that the Soviet Union is exceedingthe limit that we have chosen. Not them.I might say before the argument starts about how the Soviets cheat, steal,and lie, every intelligence agency we have says that they are generallycomplying with arms treaties and arms agreements. Here is the article fromthe New York Times dated January 10, 1986. I will ask to have it printedin the <T4>Record </T4>in just a moment.

Mr. President, you cannot get one intelligence agency in theUnited States not to tell you that the Soviets not only have been dismantlingmissile systems for every one they deploy, but they are dismantling a muchnewer, more modern weapon than we are. Our Poseidon submarines are allgoing to be out of service in the 1990's. So, when we dismantle the Poseidonsubmarine, we are not giving up very much.Under this agreement we will have to dismantle 51 missile systems by theend of 1989 fiscal year and the Soviet Union will have to dismantle about60.With no new language, if we do not pass this amendment, we will be comingout with a new Trident submarine this fall and another one in 1989, andwe will add 51 more MIRV<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>'d<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> systems, or a total of 77 above what we alreadyhave exceeded the 1320 limit by.You remember last year Senator <T4>Dole </T4>offered an amendment to our amendment saying: ``Nothing hereinis to be considered complying with the SALT II Treaty.'' And we agreedwith that.Mr. President, just as food for thought, what if we do not get a STARTTreaty for years? The START Treaty is designed to reduce the number ofwarheads on both sides by 50 percent. We have about 13,000 right now. TheSoviet Union has about 12,000.So if we had a START agreement right now, we would be reducing the numberof warheads on both sides to 6,000. But if we do not get a START agreementfor several years and 10 years from now we each have 24,000 warheads andyou get a START agreement, you are right back to where you are right now.[S11MY8-491]{S5452}LEAHYMr. LEAHY. Will the Senator yield at that point?[S11MY8-492]{S5452}BUMPERSMr. BUMPERS. Yes.[S11MY8-493]{S5452}LEAHYMr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the Senator from Arkansas is correct. I thinkhe feels as I do. We hope that President Reagan can sign a START Treatybefore he leaves office. He would like to be able to see us get the problemson the INF Treaty out of the way so the Senate could advise and consentto its ratification by the President.But if he cannot sign a START Treaty or if the President cannot ratifyone because we cannot advise and consent to it, then I urge the next Presidentto make the finishing of an agreement, strategic arms agreement that wouldcut weapons, a top priority.In the meantime, the security of NATO, the validity of the INF Treaty,and the hopes of further arms control demand we put some kind of a capon Soviet strategic missiles and bombers.Our amendment, in one sense, would do this. It freezes U.S. multiple warheadmissile and bomber deployments at their January 25, of this year, so longas equivalent Soviet deployments stay at their levels on that date, exceptfor overall multiple warhead systems. There they could theoretically riseto our 1,345, although, as a practical matter, they will not.Consider what we are saying, Mr. President. The Soviets could break outof those ceilings much easier, I believe the Senator from Arkansas wouldquickly <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ag<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ree, because of their hot missile and bomber productionlines. They could break out of an agreement very quickly, but they havenot.Why not give them an incentive not to break out? Why not give them an incentiveto stay where they are? Does anybody really think we are going to gainmore security if they increase the number of warheads they have or we increasethe numbers we have?All Bumpers-Leahy does is to say: ``Here we are on January 25. Let us keepit at these levels.'' Both countries seem to be able to live within them,and I use that term advisedly. Neither country has shown any need to gobeyond those levels.So why not have an incentive for mutual restraint here? We lose absolutelynothing by it. We are saying to Moscow, <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>``If<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> you do not increase, we will not increase. If youdo increase, we will do so also, but we know we cannot keep up with youfor some years yet, at least in number of land-based missiles.<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>''<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>I tried a lot of cases, Mr. President, when I was in private law practice,and I settled a lot of cases. A settlement which says that the other sidegives up one of their major advantages while you give up practically nothingwas a settlement you like to grab hold of. I suppose it would be the samein Arkansas. It certainly is the same around the country.I would like to see us be in a position where we could put some kind ofcap on these missiles and bombers, while at the same time encouraging thePresident to go forward with a real START agreement, something under thishe could do. Achieving a START Treaty would actually enable him to setaside Leahy-Bumpers-Chafee-Heinz.Consider the difficulties we are in. The President hoped we might ratifythe INF agreement before he went to the Moscow summit, but it appears wemay not be able to give him the advice and consent necessary, for manysolid reasons. The INF agreement by itself is a very minor agreement, andyet it may not be ratified by that time. In fact, if the worst happened, <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>we could <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>end up with a severe political crisis in NATO. Ifthe INF agreement runs into serious delays all our allies will say: ``Youare going to have to live up to your side of the bargain, United States,because that is it. As far as we are concerned, those U.S. missiles haveto come out, whether or not you get the treaty ratified. Those NATO countries went through a great deal of political turmoil whenthey accepted the U.S. Pershing and cruise missiles. I have talked withmost of the defense ministers and foreign ministers of our NATO allies,and they tell me, as far as they are concerned, the INF deployment planis over. Whether the United States ratifies it or not, those missiles arecoming out.  If we wind up with an unratified INF Treaty, the United States is, by politicalpressure, going to have to live up to its side of the agreement, and therewill be nothing on paper requiring the Soviets to live up to their side.Let us not get ourselves an even worse situation, a nuclear arms race whichthe American people do not want where the Soviet Union has most of theadvantages. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on my amendment.  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a sufficient second. The yeas and nays were ordered. [S11MY8-494]{S5453}LEAHYMr. LEAHY. Mr. President, while we cannot understand why the Soviet Unionmay have changed some of the signals on INF, especially verification, Ithink most of the Members of the Senate, both Republicans and Democrats,hope that Secretary Shultz' visit to Geneva with Mr. Shevardnadze willdo away with those differenc<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>es. Th<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ey should be resolved in such a way the d<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>is<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>tinguished Members of this body, on both sides ofthe aisle, who have expressed support for the underlying goals for theINF agreement can then be satisfied as to the verification i<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ss<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ues which we have legitimately raised, and the Senatewill be able to advise and consent to the INF agreement.<CODE-213>5</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213><CODE-213>5</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>I, for one, wish that this will be done before the President goes to Moscowso the President could then ratify the INF agreement either before he goesto Moscow or at the time he gets there. This would put the President ofthe United States in a better negotiating position when he starts talkingabout START. He will not be in any position where he will have to explainan unratified INF agreement. I might also say in that regard that I think most Members of the Senateare willing to put aside their political labels and stand as one with thePresident and hope that he will be able to go there with unanimity andsupport on an arms control issue like INF; that we can also establish herethe kind of atmosphere necessary for our chief negotiator, in this casethe President of the United States, to talk about real arms control reductions.When the President says he wants real reductions and that is <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>his <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>goal, I take him at his word. I think if that isthe case, he deserves the support of the United States, the people of thiscountry. So we face a couple of difficult issues here, Mr. President. I can expressmy hop<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>es<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> as a Senator from Vermont that Secretary Shultzand Mr. Shevardnadze will be able to settle the differences and the questionsthat have been raised by Senators on both sides of the aisle in this bodyand that the Senate can then go ahead and advise and consent to the INFagreement and the Senate can ratify it. I also express the other hope, that Bumpers-Leahy-Chafee-Heinz amendmentcan be passed once again as it has been in the past by this body and bythe other body, and send a clear <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>si<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>gnal that the United States is willing to show restraintin strategic weapons systems so long as the Sov<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ie<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>t Union does. And, of course, the purpose of thefour of us in urging interim restraint is to set up an atmosphere wherethe United States and the Soviet Union can for the first time agree o<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>n<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> real reductions in strategic weapons systems. Thisis what President Reagan has said he supports, and what Mr. Gorbachev hassaid he su<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>pp<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>orts. Frankly, it is something that the majorityof Americans have said they support. It really should not be considered that radical an idea, Mr. President.I think if we were to go out to our constituencies, whether it is in Colorado,the home of the distinguised Presiding Officer, Vermont, Rhode Island,Pennsylvania, or Arkansas, the homes of the four main sponsors of thislegislation, we would find the same thing. People are concerned about thespecter of nuclear war, and they want to see restraint first and foremoston the part of the superpowers and then they want to see an honest andrealistic effort to move us back off that threshold of nuclear posturingand overkill in t<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>he<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> number of weapons that we have. Mr. President, I applaud the distinguished Senator from Arkansas and alignmyself completely with what he has said.

No.[S11MY8-518]{S5454}QUAYLEMr. QUAYLE. We could not.[S11MY8-519]{S5454}BUMPERSMr. BUMPERS. The Senator was not here when I made my opening statement.Mr. Quayle. Was it a good one?[S11MY8-520]{S5454}BUMPERSMr. BUMPERS. I hate to belabor it for those who were, but let me give itto the Senator this way, quickly. As the Senator knows, under the SALTII Treaty, both sides were limited to 820 land-based ICBM's that were MIRV'd.Mr. Quayle. Right.[S11MY8-521]{S5454}BUMPERSMr. BUMPERS. They were limited to 1,200 land-based MIRV'd ICBM's plus submarineMIRV'd missiles. And you could mix that up just about any way you wanted.Does the Senator follow me?[S11MY8-522]{S5454}QUAYLEMr. QUAYLE. I understand what the SALT II sublimits are.[S11MY8-523]{S5454}BUMPERSMr. BUMPERS. Then we have the 1,320 sublimit which included land-based,submarine-based, plus bombers that carried <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>c<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ruise missiles. Is the Senator with me on that?[S11MY8-524]{S5454}QUAYLEMr. QUAYLE. I understand that fully.[S11MY8-525]{S5454}BUMPERSMr. BUMPERS. OK. Right now we have 550 MIRV'd land-based missiles. Theyare either MX's or Minuteman III's. Now, my point is, as a practical matter,we are not going to add anything to that 550 in the next year when we willhave to address this again.[S11MY8-526]{S5454}QUAYLEMr. QUAYLE. Does this amendment freeze that 550 if we wanted to?[S11MY8-527]{S5454}BUMPERSMr. BUMPERS. No, it does not.[S11MY8-528]{S5454}QUAYLEMr. QUAYLE. It does not.[S11MY8-529]{S5454}BUMPERSMr. BUMPERS. No.[S11MY8-530]{S5454}QUAYLEMr. QUAYLE. I guess I would read it that it would. That is why I am askingthe author of the amendment.[S11MY8-531]{S5454}BUMPERSMr. BUMPERS. We make the record very clear on that, that that does notfreeze us. Incidentally, I will tell the Senator one interesting thingabout it that will make him want to vote for this amendment. This amendmentsort of freezes the Soviet Union into weapons systems that are vulnerable,namely, land based. I can tell the Senator that as a practical matter theyare not going to be able under this amendment, or under their own plan,<CODE-213>5</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213><ITAG tagnum="80">to increase the number of submarine-launched missiles. So what weare doing is we are sort of freezing ourselves in on invulnerable systemsand freezing them in on vulnerable systems.</ITAG>[S11MY8-532]{S5454}QUAYLE<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>Mr. <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>QUAYLE. So the Senator is r<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>e<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ally saying that this is a good deal.[S11MY8-533]{S5454}BUMPERSMr. BUMPERS. It certainly is. And if the President decides that they arenot complying with the terms of this amendment, all he has to do is notifyCongress.[S11MY8-534]{S5454}QUAYLEMr. QUAYLE. I just wanted that point of clarification to see exactly whatthe Senator was freezing. My understanding is that th<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>e<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> Senator is freezing the 1,346 and not getting intothe mix within the sublimits.[S11MY8-535]{S5454}BUMPERSMr. BUMPERS. We are not.[S11MY8-536]{S5454}QUAYLEMr. QUAYLE. It is the total number of strategic MIRVed launchers that wepresently have. [S11MY8-537]{S5454}BUMPERSMr. BUMPERS. That is correct. Let me close, Mr. President, if I may, with a few comments about two orthree salient points that I think ought to be of some interest to the Membersof the body.Everybody knows that the Soviet Union is in a better position to breakout of th SALT II Treaty and break out of the limits of last year's agreementand even this amendment, if they chose to. And I might add the Soviet Unionis not going to forever restrain themselves while we continue to add strategicMIRV'd systems to our arsenal.Right now w<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>e<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> have about 65 more MIRV'd systems than they do,but they are in a better position to break out than we are, and every intelligenceagency in town will tell you that by 1992, if they choose, they can havearound 3,000 more warheads than we have.President Reagan was asked in 1982, ``You campaigned against th<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>e<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> SALT II Treaty all during the Presidential campaignof 1980. Why are you changing your mind now and saying we are not goingto undercut the treaty?''He said, ``I'll tell you why. Somebody told me the So<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>vi<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>et Union was in a much better position to break outof the treaty than we were.''Those are President Reagan's words.Now let me tell you what our allies say. Maybe you do not care what ourallies think, but I will tell you what they say anyway. Here is what thespokesman for the West German Government said: ``West Germany believesthat both superpowers should adhere to the agreed-upon upper limits onstrategic weapons systems.Francois Mitterand, just reelected in a fairly good landslide in France:[S11MY8-538]{S5454}<ITAG tagnum="21">It would have been very wise and very useful [for the U.S. to continueto comply with SALT II].</ITAG>The Belgian Foreign Ministry:[S11MY8-539]{S5454}<ITAG tagnum="21">Any non-compliance with the provisions of SALT II undertaken by whicheverside is regretted.</ITAG>Margaret Thatcher_here is what she says:[S11MY8-540]{S5454}<ITAG tagnum="21">The provisions [of SALT II] must be observed by both sides . . . difficultieswill arise if both sides do not observe them.</ITAG>Here is the Canadian Secretary of State:[S11MY8-541]{S5454}<ITAG tagnum="21">Canada strongly supports the arms control regime established by theABM and SALT agreements and believes nothing should be done to undercuttheir authority . . .

Our views on the importance of the USA abiding by the provisionsof the SALT II agreement have been conveyed to the USA Government.</ITAG>Mr. President, I could go on with statements by others. Here is Hans-DietrichGenscher, Foreign Minister of West Germany:[S11MY8-542]{S5454}<ITAG tagnum="21">We supported the United States sentiment of commitment to the SALTII treaty, although it was never ratified. Because it is very difficultto make new agreements in arms control, it is all the more important tomost carefully preserve existing treaties and adhere to them.</ITAG>Here is what six former Secretaries of Defense say.You think about that, six former Secretaries of Defense_three Republicansand three Democrats_hav<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>e<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> written a letter saying U.S. policy should be tocontinue, not to undercut, the SALT II Treaty, especially its numericallimits. Gen. Brent Scowcroft, who was Chairman of the Scowcroft Commission,and whose word is almost divine around here on strategic weaponry, hereis what he said:[S11MY8-543]{S5454}<ITAG tagnum="21">Yes, I think we should (comply with SALT II). There are restraintsin the treaty on the Soviets which, however modest, are better than havingno restraints at all.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">General Scowcroft said President Reagan's decision to comply for nowwith the 1979 arms limitation treaty (SALT II) ``made a great deal of sense.''he said the United States had nothing to gain from a policy of ``reciprocalviolation (of the treaty) because we have virtually no leverage . . .

You know,this is not beanbag. We are not debating here for the afternoon society.We are really debating just a marginal step that we can take to slow thenuclear arms race.I might tell you I had 8 percent more women votes when I ran for reelectionin 1986 than I did men. My wife insists that women are more sensitive tothis issue than men are. Maybe she is right. I do not know. But I knowthat the nine new Democratic Senators who came into the Senate in 1987,every one of them came because they got a significantly higher number ofwomen votes. That could be because we talk a lot about education on thisside. We talk a lot about child care. We talk about health for all of ourpeople but particularly children of poor families.You know, of the 37 million people in this country who have no health carecoverage, half of them are children. What do you think about the greatestnation on Earth, with all the wealth of this country, having about 18.5million children with no health care, not even Medicaid which covers thepoorest of the poor? We have $300 billion for defense, but all I am sayingis when I ran in 1986, I said I believe in health care for your children.I believe in spending sums of money to educate this country and your children.I believe in child care particularly for you women who head single familyhouseholds and trying to raise your children. But I promise you, if yousend me back to the Senate, I will do everything I can to bring this armsrace under control and guarantee your children a chance to grow to adulthood.I have been fighting for it ever since I have been here, win, lose, ordraw. I do not intend to ever quit because it makes more sense to me thananything else we ever talk about around here even though people have atendency to treat it as a political issue. It is so much greater than that.The House has already voted_last week the House voted_240 to 174. Theyvoted last week for a much stronger measure than mine. This is going tobe in the conference. It is going to be in conference. I feel like I havegiven a lot. I think my colleagues on this amendment with me feel thatwe have given a lot. But at least we will describe the parameters thatthe conference committee can deal with.Mr. President, I yield the floor.[S11MY8-548]{S5455}QUAYLEMr. QUAYLE. Will the Senator yield for a question, Mr. President?[S11MY8-549]{S5455}BUMPERSMr. BUMPERS. I yield the floor.[S11MY8-550]{S5455}QUAYLEMr. QUAYLE addressed the Chair.The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.[S11MY8-551]{S5455}QUAYLEMr. QUAYLE. Let me indulge my friend from Arkansas one more time on thisamendment because I really do not read it in the same way that he does.On page three it says it would cause the United States to exceed the numbersof MIRV<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>'<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>d<CODE-213>5</CODE-213> <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ICBM's. I presume the Senator is referring to the820 category.[S11MY8-552]{S5455}BUMPERSMr. BUMPERS. Just a moment.[S11MY8-553]{S5455}QUAYLEMr. QUAYLE. All right.[S11MY8-554]{S5455}BUMPERSMr. BUMPERS. I stand corrected. The Senator is right. I apologize. It doesfreeze the U.S. at 550 land-based ICBM's.[S11MY8-555]{S5455}QUAYLEMr. QUAYLE. In the first category we are frozen at 550 ICBM's.[S11MY8-556]{S5455}BUMPERSMr. BUMPERS. That is correct.[S11MY8-557]{S5455}QUAYLEMr. QUAYLE. How many will the Soviets be allowed to have?[S11MY8-558]{S5455}BUMPERSMr. BUMPERS. That figure is classified but they have always had considerablymore land-based missiles than we have.[S11MY8-559]{S5455}QUAYLEMr. QUAYLE. I do not believe it is classified.[S11MY8-560]{S5455}BUMPERSMr. BUMPERS. I am not going to take a chance on it. I think it is classified.It may not be. The Senator from Indiana is on the Armed Services Committee.[S11MY8-561]{S5455}QUAYLEMr. QUAYLE. I do not think it is classified.[S11MY8-562]{S5455}BUMPERSMr. BUMPERS. Does the Senator know how many they had? If he wants to sayit out here, it is OK with me.[S11MY8-563]{S5455}QUAYLEMr. QUAYLE. I am told unclassified that they have near 820. Is that correct?[S11MY8-564]{S5455}BUMPERSMr. BUMPERS. I think the Senator may be right. Close to it.[S11MY8-565]{S5455}QUAYLEMr. QUAYLE. So we would be frozen at 550, and they would be frozen at near820.[S11MY8-566]{S5455}BUMPERSMr. BUMPERS. That is the point I was trying to make a moment ago. Theyhave so many more of their missiles in vulnerable silos, and they are notgoing to change the mix, and this sort of freezes them into vulnerablesystems, while we have so many more submarine missiles than they have whichare invulnerable. So it is really a big advantage to us.[S11MY8-567]{S5455}QUAYLEMr. QUAYLE. In the second category on MIRV<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>'<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>d ballistic missiles, we are frozen at how many?[S11MY8-568]{S5455}BUMPERSMr. BUMPERS. About 1,200 and for the Soviets, too. This means that in MIRV<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>'<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>d SLBM's, we could have 650 while the Soviets canonly have 380.[S11MY8-569]{S5455}QUAYLEMr. QUAYLE. We are frozen at about 1, 200?[S11MY8-570]{S5455}BUMPERSMr. BUMPERS. That is right.[S11MY8-571]{S5455}QUAYLEMr. <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>QUAYLE. <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>And in the third category, we are frozen at 1,348,I presume.[S11MY8-572]{S5455}BUMPERSMr. BUMPERS. 1,346.[S11MY8-573]{S5455}QUAYLEMr. QUAYLE. So we were frozen at 550, about 1,200, and 1,346. That is asof January 25, 1988. We are going to freeze_this is back to the freezementality_we are going to freeze these levels at this particular date,January 25, 1988.Mr. President, this amendment is different from the amendment we have hadin the past. I would have to go back and review it. I think we talked aboutthe sublimits of SALT II, which has been the reference point, which wouldcertainly give the United States_and I think it is a bad amendment_moreflexibility.This amendment we have today is more restrictive than any Bumpers amendmentwe have had in the past, because it picks a date out of the air and justsays that we will freeze in this category of ICBM's and then MIRV<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>'<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>d ballistic missiles and in MIRV<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>'<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>d strategic systems.I do not believe it is a good idea to sit here and try to write treatieson the floor of the Senate.In this particular amendment_and I will speak on it more later_but at thistime, why in the world would the U.S. Senate want to arbitrarily pick adate out of the air in January and say we are going to freeze; we willfreeze and they will freeze?[S11MY8-574]{S5455}LEAHYMr. LEAHY. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?[S11MY8-575]{S5455}QUAYLEMr. QUAYLE. I yield.[S11MY8-576]{S5455}LEAHYMr. LEAHY. The Senator is on the Armed Services Committee. I wonder ifhe could tell me whether we have any intent_to back up a bit.The date of this amendment goes through, I believe, October 1, 1989. Isthe Senator aware of any intention to increase our MIRV<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>'<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>d ICBM's between now and that time? [S11MY8-577]{S5455}QUAYLEMr. QUAYLE. I do not think that we will, nor am I advocating that we should.I think it shows what kind of amendment we have here. We pick somethingout of the blue moon or from the stars, or wherever we get the<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>se<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> dates. I guess it is the date the INF Treaty wassubmitted to the Senate. This year, we are doing it because of the INFTreaty. Last year, the Bumpers amendment goal was something along the lines,if I recall, to control the arms race_some nice, jazzy, politically attractiveamendment. [S11MY8-578]{S5455}LEAHYMr. LEAHY. Mr. President, will the Senator yield? [S11MY8-579]{S5455}QUAYLEMr. QUAYLE. This is going to be done because of the INF Treaty.Let me conclude my point, and I will be glad to yield for questions. This amendment, as I said, is different from what we have had in the past.What is of interest is that we say, ``Well, if we're going to violate thetreaty <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>or<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> if the Soviet Union is going to violate any treaty,we have to have some sort of responses.'' This treaty was never ever ratified. Everybody knows that. We do not haveto go back into that argument. We have had a lot of discussion about treatiesand compliance and things of that sort. But what we are doing here is takingthe SALT II Treaty, trying to bind the President to something that is morerestrictive and unequal than the SALT II Treaty, the way I read the amendment_simplytrying to write this into statutory language, saying, ``Maybe this wouldbe a good deal for the Soviet Union. Senators are going to negotiate with the Soviet Union, not the Commanderin Chief. The Senate is going to negotiate with the Soviet Union on a treatythat this body was not wil<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>l<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ing to ratify. I have said time and time again, ``Why don't you call up the SALT II Treaty,and we will have a debate on it?'' I predict that it will not <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>have <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>the two-thirds vote, for a lot of reasons. It willnot be just because of people saying they invaded Afghanistan. They aregetting out of Afghanistan, we <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>think, we hope. <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>So we can debate it free and clear. But we do not want to do that, becauseyou cannot bring up the SALT II Treaty <CODE-213>5</CODE-213> in its totality, because there are many things inthe SALT II Treaty <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>that the Soviets are violating, like the encyrptionof telemetry, like the new missile. Those are just two.When we get into violations, Senators say, ``By golly, we can't stand forthose violations.''We are having a dispute right now wherein the Soviet Union entered intoa treaty that is before the Senate; and, all of a sudden, we are havingthe big argument on inspection and verification rights. But we cannot bringup the SALT II <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>Treaty <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>and debate it because there are parts the SovietUnion violated; and because they violated it, we cannot bind the UnitedStates to that, so we want to drop the things that the Soviet Union violates,but want to comply and pick a date and restrict the United States on thingsthat the Soviet Union apparently thinks is in their interest. What kindof negotiation is that?I will quote from former President Carter, April 30, 1979:[S11MY8-580]{S5456}<ITAG tagnum="21">If we ever detect any violation of the SALT agreement, that wouldbe a basis on which to reject the treaty in its entirety. There would bea possible termination of the good relationships between our country andthe Soviet Union on which detente is based, and it might very well escalateinto nuclear confrontation.</ITAG>Tough talk.The Senate Foreign Relations Committee voted 15 to 0 on the SALT II Treaty.<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>I<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>t said:[S11MY8-581]{S5456}<ITAG tagnum="21">Failure to transmit relevant telemetry information which results inthe impeding of verification by the United States will be raised by theUnited States in the standing consultative commission; and if the issueis not resolved to the satisfaction of the United States, the United Statesreserves the right to exercise all other available remedies, includingbut not limited to the right to withdraw from the treaty.<CODE-213>5</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213></ITAG>No use to withdraw from the treaty. We never ratified the treaty. Now weare going to pick and choose which part of the treaty, which is unratified,we should bind ourselves to.Apparently, the Soviets like and are willing to go along with the sublimits,are willing to go along with the <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>l<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>imitations, whether it would be the ICBM's or theSLBM's, including the bombers, the strategic MIRV systems. They are overthe strategic nuclear vehicles. They are violating that. They are overthat limit. That is part of SALT II. But we have to take that out becausethey violated that part of the treaty. So we drop all the things the Sovietsviolate, and we sit there and try to put on ourselves the things that theSoviet Union apparently wants.Boy, am I glad that the Senate does not sit down and negotiate treaties,if that is the way that we are going to negotiate treaties and that isthe kind of treaty that some in the Senate would like to have.The reason, in my judgment, that the Soviets are willing to go ahead andbe bound by these limits is that there is no incentive for them at allto get into any more MIRV's, or warheads. They already have our targetscovered by their hard target killers. They are way ahead of us in thatcategory.You want to look at trying to have deterrence and want to have peace, andI have to say that nuclear weapons, as hideous as they are, are politicalinstruments, and in fact we make an investment in strategic weapons tomaintain stability and maintain peace and in fact it has worked. Nobodyis going to refute that. It has worked.Why do they need anymore? They already can knock out our hard targets,which are a little over 1,000 hardened sites <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>with <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>their SS-18's and SS-19's. They have over 5,000 warheadsthat are hard target killers. They do not need any more to cover our targets.Yet i<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>f<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> we look at their hardened silos and command bunkers,they have over 3,000 and we have only 900 ballistic missile warheads thatare accurate enough to ever hope to knock them out. As for the Soviets'mobile ICBM's our ability to target them is quite limited. I would just say, Mr. President, that as you look at this thing here <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>w<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>e go again. I have heard time and time again thatthe reason we have to have these amendments is that this administrationis not interested in arms control. I also have heard where we have talkedabout going beyond the SALT limits. They said, o<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>h<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>, my gosh, if we do that you are going to break offnegotiations. The<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>re<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> are all sorts of dire predictions of what kind ofrelationship we would have vis-a-vis the Soviet Union. All of that is ared herring, all of those arguments. You do not hear that too much anymorebecause all those dire predictions of doom and gloom that, by golly, ifwe do this and we go on our way problems are going to erupt did not cometrue. This administration is not serious about arms control. Yet you know any other view is just absolutely lunacy. We have the Secretary of State over there today <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>or <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>tonight. He is tired. He had a good day, you willfind out in his meeting with the Foreign Minister of the Soviet Union talkingabout concluding the arms control agreement on INF, and talking about otherpotential agreements. And to say that this administration is not interestedin arms control is absolutely absurd. Yet we say we have to go ahead and try to tie the President's hands. Weare simply going to write this thing on the floor, and this amendment ismuch different than the amendment that we have had in the past. The amendmentin the past referred to that SALT Treaty but not this amendment. This amendmenton a date picked out of the air_I guess I should not say ``picked out ofthe air'' in deference to the Senator from Arkansas_he said the reasonthey picked that date that was the date the INF Treaty was submitted tothe Senate. So the day that the treaty was submitted to the United States Senate isthe day that the United States <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>Senate <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>is being asked to bind this country, and we are goingto ask good faith on the part of the Soviet Union, but if the Soviet Unionviolates this then the President just has to certify and we go, I guess,as far are they go, so they can control what in effect is in this agreement.This is no place to be writing treaties. Treaties are to be conducted betweenheads of state. Sure, we can push and we can cajole, and we can ask andwe can request and we can demand, but we should not be writing treaties.You are not going to write treaties on the floor of the Senate. That isprecisely what this amendment is trying to do. And it goes in the direction_Ihope the Senate understands that_that we are simply binding ourselves asto what we can do on our land base, our sea base, and our bomber base ona date of January 25, 1988. Wheel of fortune, this happens to come up_January25, 1988. I hope that this amendment will be tabled so we can get on with the businessof the Armed Services Committee and we can pass a defense bill.The Senator is right, we are going to have this issue in the conference.It has been passed by the House of Representatives.[S11MY8-582]{S5457}LEAHYMr. LEAHY. Mr. President, earlier I asked the Senator if he would yieldfor a question, and he said he would be willing to yie<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ld.<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> I wonder if he is still willing to yield for a question.The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Indianasays that we have no intention of increasing our MIRV<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>'<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>d ICBM's before October 1989. Am I correct in myunderstanding on that?I know we have no request in the Appropriations Committee for the moneyto do it.[S11MY8-585]{S5457}QUAYLEMr. QUAYLE. I think it is a possibility with the MX and depending on howwe go on the MX debate that we might_in fact it is a possibility_let meconclude my answer.[S11MY8-586]{S5457}LEAHYMr. LEAHY. The administration told me__[S11MY8-587]{S5457}QUAYLEMr. QUAYLE. Mr. President, I claim the floor. I want to respond to theSenator's question. I am glad to respond to the Senator's question andI will be glad to yield for questions.In answer to the Senator's question is there any intention to have anymore MIRV<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>'<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>d ICBM's, I think the MX is a possibility and itis a possibility depending on what you might want to do that you mightin fact not have any design now.We do not know how the debate on the MX, rail garrison, production lines,will be, but I say there is a possibility that we might in fact go abovewhat we had on January 25, 1988.[S11MY8-588]{S5457}LEAHYMr. LEAHY. Will the Senator yield for a question?[S11MY8-589]{S5457}QUAYLEMr. QUAYLE. I am glad to yield for the purpose of a question.[S11MY8-590]{S5457}LEAHYMr. LEAHY. If a key figure in the administration told the Senator fromVermont or the Appropriations Committee that there is no intention to increaseour MIRV<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>'<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>d ICBM's between now and October 1989, would he bemisleading us?[S11MY8-591]{S5457}QUAYLEMr. QUAYLE. I would say that the question that the Senator from Vermontposed to me was a general question, whether I thought that there wouldbe any additional MIRV<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>'<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>d ICBM's, and I said I do not know of any. I said,it is certainly possible depending on the MX. Now we get a question aboutsome administration official said they did not have any plans. If the administrationofficial said that I accept that, and I am not going to say for certainwhether they would or would not. Whether they do or not I do not thinkis relevant.I think what is relevant is that what we have done here is to pick a dateand we have frozen in 550 ICBM's for the United States and about 820 ICBM'sfor the Soviet Union.Now then I might point out that the Jackson amendment, that I presume theSenator from Vermont and the Senator from Arkansas are familiar with, theJackson amendment that was statute that was passed in the SALT I ABM debatesaid that we would never agree to unequal ceilings. That was the Jacksonamendment, and this resolution would violate the Jackson amendment.We can go back and we violate and overturn statutes and change things howeverwe want to, but I do not think that the U.S. Senate wants to go on recordthe day that they are negotiating in Geneva saying that in fact the U.S.Senate would agree to unequal ceilings. That is precisely the end resultof this amendment the way it is drafted.[S11MY8-592]{S5457}LEAHYMr. LEAHY. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a further question?[S11MY8-593]{S5457}QUAYLEMr. QUAYLE. I yield the floor.[S11MY8-594]{S5457}NUNNMr. NUNN addressed the Chair.The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.[S11MY8-595]{S5457}NUNNMr. NUNN. I will be glad to yield to my friend.I would like to inquire of the floor manager and also<CODE-213>5</CODE-213> of <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>the authors of the amendment how much more debatewe are going to need tonight. I would like about 5 minutes myself. I wonderif I could get some indication how much more debate because the plan wouldbe to have a tabling motion, I believe, and try to complete the vote asquickly as possible because we have a general agreement <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>because <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>of certain activities taking place tonight to concludethe final vote about 6:15.[S11MY8-596]{S5457}QUAYLEMr. QUAYLE.

Let me take that and run it through our leadership in our <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>C<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>loakroom. But you would have a vote on tabling motionaround__[S11MY8-598]{S5457}NUNNMr. NUNN. I would like to start in about 10 minutes if we could or 6:05,and it is really to accommodate some people I believe primarily on theminority side.[S11MY8-599]{S5457}LEAHYMr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I say to the Senator from Georgia, the last thingin the world I would want to do is to have an arms control debate slowup a Republican fundraiser. We are only talking about destroying all ofmankind. I would not want us to have to take more than another 10 or 15minutes if it would inconvenience the fundraising activity on the otherside.But the point I made earlier, and the Senator from Indiana has raised awhole lot of points, but, basically, I would point out that we are undera congressionally imposed cap of 50 MX missiles. If we did deploy an<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>y<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> more MX's, they will be on a rail garrison whichwould not be before 1991 at the earliest. We do not have any other ICBM'sin production. We are under a pragmatic limitation on ICBM's anyway underthis resolution.The point is we give up absolutely nothing by keeping to the limits wenow have because there are not going to be any more, not in the 16 or 17months or so of this resolution.As far as where we do have superiority, of course, is in the far less vulnerableSLBM's. And I think the Senator from Indiana would agree that a MIRV<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>'d<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> SLBM is far less vulnerable than a MIRV<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>'d<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> ICBM.[S11MY8-600]{S5457}NUNNMr. NUNN. Mr. President, would the Senator state the question?[S11MY8-601]{S5457}LEAHYMr. LEAHY. That is the question. Does the Senator from Indiana agree thata MIRV<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>'d<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> SLBM <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>i<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>s less vulnerable than a MIRV<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>'d<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> ICBM?[S11MY8-602]{S5457}QUAYLEMr. QUAYLE. It would depend. Some Soviet mobile ICBM's are quite difficultto target; other Soviet missiles are in very hard silos.[S11MY8-603]{S5457}NUNNMr. NUNN. Mr. President, let me say again, I do not want to cut off debate.With deference to my colleagues, if the <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>S<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>enator from <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>Ve<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>rmont and the Senator from Arkansas do not thinkthey could conclude this debate or do not want to vote this evening, thenI will have to defer to their judgment on that. I am not going to moveto table my<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>s<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>elf unless they tell me they are through with thedebate.I am inquirin<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>g<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> to see if they think we have had a full enough debateon this subject. I plan to take 4 or 5 minutes myself.[S11MY8-604]{S5457}LEAHYMr. LEAHY. If the Senator would yield just for one moment, obviously anybodycould stand and move to table if they got the floor. If there were thoseconcerned enough about gettin<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>g<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> to the fundraiser that they wanted to table, theycould get to do it. So, certainly, they could move to table anytime.I appreciate the courtesy of the distinguished Senator, the <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>c<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>hairman o<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>f<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> the Armed Services Committee. I would be perfectlywilling_if it is possible to keep a couple more minutes for me, fine_butI would also be perfectly willing if anybody wanted to vote up or downright now.[S11MY8-605]{S5457}BUMPERSMr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, let me just say to the distinguished Senatorfrom Georgia, the chairman of the committee, that I am ready to vote. TheSenator wants 4 or 5 minutes to sp<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>e<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ak. I do not know who else may want some time, butI am prepared to vote at 6 or 6:15, either one.[S11MY8-606]{S5457}NUNNMr. NUNN. Mr. President, I will just make a few remarks. I would have tosay that I find myself in somewhat of an unusual and uncomfortable positionhere, because I happen to agree with the goals that the Senator from Vermontand the Senator from <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>A<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>rkansas have set forth.I also agree that it did not make sense and still does not make sense forthe United States to have exceeded the SALT II sub<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>c<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>eilings while we were trying to get a START agreementand while negotiations were going forward on both sides in that respect.We have a long way to go in the START agreement. We do have, certainly,concerns about Soviet compliance with certain aspects. But on the subceilings,I think that it is clear that the Soviet Union has, generally speaking,been dismantling old systems when they have been adding new ones. I thinkit is in our best interest to stay within those general parameters.I also have to say, though_and I have said it many times_that I do notbelieve in doing by statute what the Constitution of the United Statesintended to be done by treaty. I have never believed that we should putin a provision that basically requi<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>r<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>es that SALT II, which has never been ratified, becomplied with. I felt that the informal arrangement begun in 1979 was asatisfactory arrangement. When the President decided to depart from thatarrangement in 1986, then it left the Senate in an awkward situation andwe have been debating this subject every year since then.So, do we ignore it altogether and let the ceilings go up and hope thatwe get a START agreement and that we do not encourage proliferation onboth sides, or do we go the other way and put ceilings in the law, neverhaving ratified the SALT II Treaty? That is a dilemma for me and I seethe argument both ways.Last year, as the Senator from Arkansas will recall, there were certainnumbers put in the Bumpers-Leahy amendment. At that time, I had been oppposedto that amendment, but then I voted for it on the last vote. The reasonwas that the min<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>o<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>rity leader, the Senator from Kansas, put in a provisionthat said that the SALT II ceilings are not part of the law of the landand, notwithstanding any other provision, that we are not in this bodyratifying that treaty and that if we were going to be compelled to abideby it, it would only be under the normal procedure. That was the generaleffect.With that understanding, I felt that the suggested subceilings for U<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>nited State<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> and Soviet forces proposed by the Senator from Vermontand the Senator from Arkansas had a differnt coloration at that point intime. It was clear that they were not the SALT II provisions under thatDole amendment, which I believe most people voted for. We were not, ineffect, writing a treaty into the law of t<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>h<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>e land by a simple majority vote.Now, I find myself agreeing again with the goal, but finding that I donot agree with the way this amendment is drafted. I do not like to be tootechnical on these matters, but it is true that what we have in this amendmentis a mandate that the MIRV<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>'d<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> land-based systems of the United States be at 550,because that was where they were on the date that this amendment references.Now, <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>how<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> does that compare to SALT II? It is more restrictivethan SALT II and it is more restrictive than the number permitted <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>the <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>Soviet Union on MIRV'd land-based systems.We have a whole history in this body_maybe it is an overemphasis_on land-basedsystems. However, there is no doubt about that fact, going back to 1972.There was a big debate then, when Senator Jackson, from Washington State,one of our colleagues and most respected Senators, had an amendment thatpassed that said we would not have an inferior position regarding the levelof strategic systems co<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>m<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>pared with the Soviet Union.So we are in a situation, if we vote for this amendment now, of, in fact,mandating a limit that is more restrictive on U<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>nited States<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> MIRV'd land-based systems than on the Soviets orunder the SALT II limit. For that reason, I will not be able to vote forthis amendment.I would say to my colleagues, though, that I know they are going to geta very healthy vote. I do not know whether they will win or whether theywill lose. It may be a close vote. But I do understand the goals that theyare seeking, and I agree with the goals they are seeking.I do not think it makes sense for us to encourage a proliferation on bothsides if the START agreement is not agreed to. I think there are a lotof indications that we may not get a START agreement in the next <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>few <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>months. I hope we do. But I hope if we get one, itis a sound agreement. I do not want one unless it is a sound agreement.So I think the Senator from Indiana and I agree on that. But I believe that the situation with START now indicat<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>es<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> that we should even be more sensitive to this possibilityof both sides proliferating systems because the other side is doing so.Therefore, when we go to conference, whether or not this amendment prevails,we will have an amendment on the House side that deals with this. It isvery similar to the amendment that the Senator from Arkansas proposed lastyear.I will let my colleague know that, as far as this conferee is concerned,even though I am voting opposing this at this point in time, I do agreewith the goals, and it would be my view that we would be in a situationin the conference where we would really have to work out something to seethat the United States stayed within the rough parameters of the overallnumbers that reflect the sublimits on a strictly informal basis and noton a basis of law.Now, how do we do that as a practical matter? I think the likelihood is,as Congressman <T4>Aspin </T4>has already said, we will do it by taking a step that islikely to occur anyway, and that is retiring a submarine that is alreadygoing to be retired rather than overhauled. We will have to do that inan informal way because this is an extremely<CODE-213>5</CODE-213> volatile subject and a sensitive subject with theWhite House and th<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>e Reagan administration. We will have to work itout carefully, and we will be in consultation.So I would say that whatever happens on this amendment, and I shall voteto table, we are going to have the matter before us in conference and weare going to have to work on it in conference.Mr. President, I would__<CODE-213>1</CODE-213>[S11MY8-607]<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>{S5458}<CODE-213>1</CODE-213>BUMPERSMr. <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>BUMPERS. Would the Senator yield for one observationor question?[S11MY8-608]{S5458}NUNNMr. NUNN. I will be glad to.[S11MY8-609]{S5458}BUMPERSMr. BUMPERS. The Senator is correct, the House provision is a simple restraintbased on the SALT II limits which does, indeed, give you the 820-1,200flexibility that we were talking about. So, you could go with the Houselanguage. But our limits are higher and I think much easier for the UnitedStates to comply with, just simply because of what we have in the works,including the dismantling of a Poseidon.But let me just ask the Senator, while we are limiting_and this was donewith some deliberation_we are limiting the United States to 550 ICBM, land-basedmissiles, and we are limiting the Soviet Union, who has a much higher,about 820, they are up to the limit_my point is this: No. 1, they are notgoing to be able to change their mix either, which they probably do notplan to. But you see, they have a lot more what I consider vulnerable systemsthan we have because we have a lot more submarines which are invulnerable.But can the Senator tell us anything, and we will certainly visit thisnext year just as we have every year for the past 6 or 8, can the Senatortell me of anything that he can think of that would cause the United Statesto want to exceed the 550 limits?I do not think we are capable of exceeding the 550 limit this year, nextyear, or the following year, and have no intention of exceedng the 550limit. So I do not understand why. And with the knowledge that you aregoing to go to the House which gives you the kind of flexibility that givesyou two options; you will have time to reflect.In my opinion this amendment really favors the United States because weare locking them into the most vulnerable systems and locking ourselvesinto the most invulnerable systems and at the same time we are not doinganything to alter our plans for what we intend to do for the next 2 or3 years so far as land-based missiles are concerned.[S11MY8-610]{S5458}NUNNMr. NUNN. I would just say that I agree with part of what my colleagueand friend has said about the practical effects, in terms of our plans.At least for the next year.I think the truth of it is, and this is one of the big problems in ourSTART negotiations now, our country does not know where we are going inland-based systems. We do not know what we are going to do about the MXrail mobile. We do not know what we are going to do about the Midgetman.We have had 8 years, maybe even 10 years of debate on this subject andwe still do not know and it is awfully hard for me to be able to visualizehow we are going to enter into a START agreement which is sound if we donot know what we are going to do with our land-based components. So nextyear as a practical matter the difference between the 820 figure and the550 figure is not going to make much difference.I do think, though, based on the history of this body and the debate inthis body and the history of concern about the window of vulnerability,all the concerns we have had about equality between the United States andthe Soviet Union, including the Jackson amendment, that the perceptionand the symbolism of imposing by law a ceiling on land-based systems thatis substantially lower than the SALT II limits and lower than the SovietUnion is important. So much of this arms control business concerns perceptionsnow. I think there are some practical considerations that sometimes arefar divorced from the perception and the symbolism.I would say the Senator is correct in part. I would also say, though, thatI would not state, with the kind of certainty that the Senator has stated,about the complete vulnerability of land-based missiles, at least not onthe Soviet side.The SS-24 on the Soviet side is going to be MIRV'd and mobile. The SS-25on the Soviet side is going to be mobile. So the Soviet Union apparentlyread the Scowcroft report and took it seriously. Unfortunately, in thiscountry, we have not seemed to be able to have come to this kind of conclusion.They have gone mobile. We have not gone mobile and we have no consensusnow as to how we are going to go mobile and when we are going to go mobile.Mr. President, I yield the floor. I do not want to cut anyone off but itis my intent to move to table in a few minutes.The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.[S11MY8-611]{S5459}HELMSMr. HELMS. Thank you very much.The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair called on the Senator from South Carolina.[S11MY8-612]{S5459}HELMSMr. HELMS. Fine.[S11MY8-613]{S5459}THURMONDMr. THURMOND. Go ahead, if you want.[S11MY8-614]{S5459}HELMSMr. HELMS. I will be rather brief. I thank the Senator. I have been herefor an hour and a half.[S11MY8-615]{S5459}THURMONDMr. THURMOND. I have been here for 3 or 4 hours, but go ahead; I will yieldto you.[S11MY8-616]{S5459}HELMSMr. HELMS. Well, it does not matter. We will both be here for a while longer.Mr. President, the pending amendment should be defeated because currentSoviet deployments have already made the amendment nugatory. The Bumpersamendment states that it will be null and void if the Soviets are exceedingthe SALT II sublimits. But the Soviets already are exceeding the SALT IIsublimits, according to official administration statement. Therefore theamendment is just a rhetorical exercise, but a dangerous one since it setsa precedent that a failed treaty can be put into effect by legislation.Let's look at the waiver. The language is as follows:[S11MY8-617]{S5459}<ITAG tagnum="21">The prohibition <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>[<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>that is, on United States MIRV'd ICBM's, MIRV'd SLBM's,and heavy bombers equipped with air-launched cruise missiles in excessof those the United States had deployed on January 25, 1988] shall notapply if the President notifies the Congress in writing that * * * theSoviet Union has deployed strategic launchers and platforms in excess ofthe numbers of launchers of MIRV'd ICBM's, or MIRV'<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>d<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> ballistic missiles, or MIRV'<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>d<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> strategic systems that it had deployed on January25, 1988.</ITAG>Mr. President, for all practical purposes, the waiver conditions have alreadybeen met. I have discussed this with the administration. The administrationstates that the Soviets are already over the SALT II sublimit. An administrationofficial has officially informed me that the following statement is bothaccurate and unclassified.[S11MY8-618]{S5459}<ITAG tagnum="21">Information indicates that the Soviets are currently over the SALTII sublimit of 1,200 MIRV'<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>d<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> ICBM and MIRV'<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>d<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> SLB<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>M<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> launchers, and on occasion have exceeded this sublimitsince mid-1987.</ITAG>What this statement means is that the Soviets do not regard the sublimitas a limit at all. As they modernize and redeploy their forces, they areguided by their own military needs, not by the need to meet any so-calledSALT II sublimit. At some times they are ``above'' the sublimit, and atother times they are ``below'' the sublimit, although I admit that in thepresent context above and below are meaningless terms of reference. TheSoviets have not taken upon themselves any obligation to meet any supposedsublimit. Their levels go up and down according to their military needs,without reference to the terms of SALT II.Of course, you might say that they could come into so-called complianceat any time if for reasons of their own military strategy, the number ofdeployments temporarily dips. Yes, they could do that. But the fact remainsthat they go up and they go down and they go up again. The truth is thatthey do not pay any attention to<CODE-213>5</CODE-213> <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>any unilateral limit, even if legislated by the U.S.Congress.The bottom line, Mr. President, is that today, at this very moment, theSoviets have more MIRV'd ICBM's, MIRV'd SLBM's, and heavy bombers equippedwith long-range air-launched cruise missiles than they had on January 25,1988, and the administration has said so.Therefore, you might say that the waiver clause of the amendment has alreadybeen invoked by the administration_at least, <CODE-213>1</CODE-213>it's <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>just a matter of form. The President will be forcedto invoke it by the facts of present Soviet deployments. So the amendmentis, for all practical purposes, null and void.Nevertheless, the amendment is mischievous, Mr. President. It perpetuatesthe dangerous illusion that the Soviets somehow feel bound by SALT II.They do not. The Bumpers amendment is unilateral disarmament that callsinto question the basic right of the United States to provide for its owndefense. This amendment is the worst kind of delusion: it represents thesurrender to illusion.[S11MY8-619]{S5459}McCLUREMr. <T4>McCLURE.</T4> Mr. President, I rise in vehement opposition to the amendmentbefore us.The sponsors of this amendment have attempted some creative packaging.By entitling their amendment ``The INF Treaty Reinforcement Act,'' theyhope to capitalize on what is left of the warm fuzzy feelings surroundingthe INF Treaty. But I am afraid that some ``truth in advertising'' is needed.What this amendment should be called is the ``INF Sabotage Act,'' becauseI can't think of anything less helpful for the INF Treaty than sendingthe message that the Soviets can violate treaties with impunity.Let me ask my colleagues to put themselves in Marshall Akhromeyev's shoes.We all know that the INF Treaty, de<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>sp<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ite its unprecedented verification procedures, stillgives the Soviets the opportunity to amass a covert force of SS-20's ifthey decide<CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>As former Assistant Secretary of Defense RichardPerle said, the failure to respond to Soviet violations ``leads to a dangerousdouble-standard and confirms to the Soviets the value of cheating.'' Theywill only be deterred from cheating if they are convinced that the advantagesof cheating will be outweighed by the disadvantages of a vigorous U.S.response.<CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>So I would advise my colleagues who support the INFTreaty and who support arms control to take a very close look at this amendment.Because if the INF Treaty is ratified only to fail because of Soviet violations,that will be a severe setback for the arms control process.<CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>Of course, one of the ironies of the INF Treaty isthe extensive procedures it provides for ensuring that no SS-20's, whichare illegal under INF, are produced or deployed in the guise of ``INF-legal''SS-25's. The SS-25, as we all know, is one of the key Soviet SALT II violations,and was deployed during the period when a policy of interim restraint,similar to what the sponsors are proposing today, was in place. Saying``this is not an SS-20, it's an SS-25'' is about as convincing as saying,``I am not a burglar, I am an axe-murderer.''<CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>Now I know that some of my colleagues do not thinkthe Soviet SALT II violations are important. But that is not what the Carteradministration thought at the time it signed the treaty. In 1979, PresidentCarter said telemetry encryption was just as serious a violation as exceedingthe limits on strategic weapons_those are the limits we are talking abouttoday_and would be grounds for abrogation of the treaty.<CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>Secretary of State Cyrus Vance touted the ban onnew types_the ban violated by the SS-25_as one of the main achievementsof the SALT II Treaty. So it seems to follow that if these provisions wereconsidered vital elements of SALT II by the progenitors of that treaty,then the violation of these provisions must be considered very seriousbusiness indeed.<CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>The Senate Foreign Relations Committee shared theseconcerns. The committee, including a number of my distinguished colleagueshere today, voted unanimously for an understanding <ITAG tagnum="80">providing that the encryption of telemetry could constitute groundsfor withdrawal from the treaty. </ITAG>The Senate Foreign Relations Committee also argued in its report on theSALT II Treaty would be ``countered by a timely response upon detection.''But what happened when the Reagan administration, belatedly, respon<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ds<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> to Soviet SALT violations? The Congress binds us,unilaterally, to a treaty that was never even ratified and would have expiredby now if it had been. Mr. President, I hope I do not offend my colleagues here today if I tellthem that I find this behavior perverse and masochistic. It is absurd tobind ourselves to an agreement that really never even existed. It is doublyabsurd to do so when our so-called partners in the agreement have madea mockery of its provisions. Mr. President, this amendment is silly. It is ridiculous. It defies commonsense. It is not worthy of us. [S11MY8-620]{S5460}HELMSMr. HELMS. Mr. President, I have a parliamentary inquiry. Is the Senatorfrom North Carolina correct that the pending perfecting amendment by theSenator from Vermont, Mr. <T4>Leahy,</T4> is divisible? The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. <T4>Daschle</T4>).

I simply was asking, inasmuch as it is a perfecting amendmentand not an amendment in the nature of a substitute, whether it is amendableat the end. The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise in opposition to this amendment. Itwould prohibit the expenditure of funds for any action which would causethe United States to exceed the levels of three SALT II numerical subceilingsas of January 25, 1988. As noted by the distinguished Senator from Georgia[Mr. <T4><CODE-213>5</CODE-213>N<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>unn<CODE-213>5</CODE-213></T4><G7./>0T1], this would be more restrictive for the United Statesthan for the U.S.S.R.This amendment effectively mandates compliance with an expired agreementthat has never been ratified by the Senate. Moreover, the Soviet Unionhas for several years violated, and continues to violate, some of the centralprovisions of SALT II. The United States sought repeatedly to correct Sovietnoncompliance,<CODE-213>5</CODE-213> a<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>nd gave the Soviets over a year and a half to correctthe situation before deciding 2 years ago to end our unilateral adherence.While the sponsors of this amendment regard the numerical sublimits asthe ``essence'' of SALT II, proponents of the treaty in 1979 argued thatthe essence of SALT II was found in three key provisions_the new typeslimit, the SNDV numerical limit, and the provisions on telemetry encryption_provisionswhich today are being violated by the Soviet Union and ignored by the sponsorsof this amendment.The proponents of this amendment argue that continued adherence of theSoviets to the SALT II sublimits is important for the national securityof the United States, especially in the context of the INF Treaty. Yetthese limits have not constrained the Soviet inventory. In the 8 yearssince the signing of SALT II, the Soviet Union almost doubled its inventoryof strategic weapons, and under SALT II sublimits, could add another 3,000warheads.These facts run exactly counter to the claim that these sublimits willprevent the Soviets from replacing SS-20's eliminated under the INF <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>T<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>reaty with modern MIRV<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>'<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>d systems now in production. I would also remindmy colleagues that the Soviets do not need to build more weapons to coverSS-20 targets_they have enough strategic weapons today to cover them withoutdegrading their strategic missions.Mr. President, in making his interim restraint decision, President Reaganestablished the policy that as long as there is no significant change inthe threat facing the United States, the United States will not deploymore strategic ballistic missile warheads or more strategic nuclear deliveryvehicles than the U.S.S.R. The <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>P<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>resident's policy forms a much better foundationfor mutual restraint than unilateral legislated compliance with part ofthe SALT II Treaty. This is especially the case as negotiations are ongoingon real reductions in the numbers of nuclear weapons.SALT II does not constrain Soviet warhead growth. SALT II has not beenratified by the Senate and could not be ratified today if a vote were taken.Finally, the Soviets are violating key provisions of SALT II that are ignoredby the amendment.Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment. [S11MY8-626]{S5460}CHAFEEMr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I am pleased once again to join my distinguishedcolleagues from Pennsylvania, <CODE-213>1</CODE-213>Arkansas, <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>and Vermont in this continuing effort to bring abouta more realistic U.S. policy on strategic arms. Today we are offering anamendment to limit the United States and Soviet strategic weapons arsenalsand, in so doing, bolster the military value of the Intermediate-rangeNuclear Forces Treaty.We are on the threshold of a new era of arms control, Mr. President. TheSenate will soon take up ratification of the INF Treaty, the first armscontrol treaty to eliminate an entire class of nuclear weapons. As we deliberatethis important agreement, I strongly believe we should seize this opportunityto ensure that the security objectives of the INF Treaty can be realized.The INF Treaty and strategic arms control are intertwined. Thus, now thatan agreement has been signed by the United States and the Soviet Union,we believe there should be a mutually observed and stable temporary capon strategic forces until a strategic arms reductions talks [START] agreementcan be concluded.We four have been hammering at the issue of U.S. compliance with key SALTII sublimits for 6 years. Last October, the Senate approved a similar amendmentwhich we offered during consideration of the Department of Defense Authorizationbill for fiscal year 1988 and 1989. This <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>5<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>7<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>-to-<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>41 vote made clear the Senate's support for restraintin the most destabilizing categories of strategic offensive weapons, thatis, ACLM-carrying heavy bombers and <CODE-213>1</CODE-213>MIRV'd <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>missiles.We continue to believe that the core sublimits of the SALT II Treaty shouldnot have been abandoned by the United States in November 1986. And we stillbelieve that continued United States adherence to those limits serves ournational security interests, so long as the Soviets also adhere to thesame limits.Now that the United States and Soviet Union have an agreement on IntermediateNuclear Forces, the need for limits on strategic offensive weapons is evenmore acute. The INF Treaty is a breakthrough in arms control, and I hopeit will be ratified by the Senate. However, there is the potential forits military value to be severely <CODE-213>1</CODE-213>undercut <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>by a Soviet strategic build-up.Were the SALT II <CODE-213>1</CODE-213>limits <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>to be abandoned by the administration, there is nothingin place to prevent the Soviets from using new <CODE-213>1</CODE-213>strategic <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>missiles to compensate for the eliminated INF weapons.The Soviets, with large <CODE-213>1</CODE-213>MIRV'd <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ICBM forces and ongoing production lines, can easilyreplace with long-range launchers all the SS-20 launchers it is removingunder the INF Treaty.Our amendment would ensure the military benefit of the INF Treaty to NATOby imposing an interim restraint on certain strategic forces pending thesigning of a START agreement.Our amendment does not specify compliance with the SALT II numerical sublimits.Rather, it upholds the spirit of the SALT II restraints. It caps Sovietstrategic force deployments while also taking into account the growth inour own strategic forces up to the time of the submission of the <CODE-213>1</CODE-213>treaty <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>to the Senate.It provides that no funds can be obligated or expended to deploy <CODE-213>1</CODE-213>MIRV'd <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>strategic launchers or platforms in excess of thenumber deployed by the United States on January 25, 1988_the date the INFTreaty was submitted to the Senate_so long as the Soviet Union does notexceed those levels.Our amendment would allow the President to set aside these restrictionsif he certifies to Congress that:Fir<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>st, <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>a new strategic arms agreement between the UnitedStates and the Soviet Union has entered into force; orSecond, <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>th<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>e United States and the Soviet Union have agreedon an alternative interim restraint agreement; orThird, <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>th<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>e Soviets have deployed strategic systems in excessof those deployed on January 25, 1988; orFourth, <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>un<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>certainties in United States intelligence assessmentsprevent the President from certifying that the Soviets are observing theinformal ceiling of January 25, 1988, level of deployments.The INF accord_revolutionary as it is_will only be truly beneficial tothe security of NATO if there are some limits on Soviet strategic nuclearforces. Without these restraints on Soviet long-range missiles, the Sovietswill be free to compensate for their dismantled, intermediate-range SS-20'sby deploying more strategic missiles that could be aimed at European targets.Restoring the SALT sublimit framework will therefore help prevent Sovietundercutting of the INF accord.Not only will our amendment ensure that the INF <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>Tr<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>eaty is militarily beneficial to us and our NATOallies, it will improve the chances that a strategic agreement will bereached. If it passes and becomes law, and the Soviets agree to join theUnited States in adhering to an interim restraint on strategic deployments,I think this initiative will give a strong push to the strategic talks.It will lend so<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>me <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>stability and predictability to the nuclear arsenalsof the two countries. Such a bilateral restraint will enhance the atmosphereof cooperation necessary for the achievement of a new treaty to reducestrategic arms.This amendment is ai<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>me<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>d squarely at the future security of the United States.It is meant to serve as a concrete interim restraint on strategic nuclearforces until a future United States-Soviet strategic agreement is achieved.I urge all <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>Se<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>nators to support the INF Treaty Reinforcement Actof 1988.[S11MY8-627]{S5461}PELLMr. PELL. Mr. President, I strongly support this amendment. After monthsof hearings on the INF Treaty, it became very clear that the treaty's primarysignificance is political rather than military. That reality does not diminishthe importance of the <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>tr<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>eaty, but it does mean we should not exaggerate themilitary benefits it will bring. First, the treaty covers only a smallfraction of the superpowers' nuclear arsenals. Second, all the targetscovered by INF missiles can be struck by other nuclear systems that arenot covered by the treaty. Furthermore, in the absence of any constraintson strategic forces, the Soviets can simply build new strategic systemsto cover those targets that were covered by INF missiles.That is why this amendment is so critical. While the INF Treaty representsan important poli<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>tic<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>al step forward_and I hope the remaining problemswill be quickly resolved_it does nothing to curb the growth of the strategicarsenals. In the absence of a START agreement, both sides remain free toexpand their strategic forces. Thus, until a START agreement is concluded,it makes sense to impose some modest interim restraint on nuclear forces.This amendment simply caps the arsenals at the already high levels theyhad reached at the time the President submitted the INF Treaty to the Senate.At a time the President is talking about dramatic cuts in the nuclear arsenals,this amendment represents a small, but important step in the right direction.This amendment also contains an important provision requiring the administrationto provide a report detailing the number of United States and Soviet missilesthat have been dismantled since the SALT I Treaty. I think it is importantto have that information presented in an authoritative manner. Indeed,the fiscal year 1988 and 1989 ACDA authorization bill approved by the Congresslast year includes such a requirement in connection with an annual reporton adherence to and compliance with arms control agreements. That informationis to be provided short<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>l<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>y and on an annual basis thereafter. I think therecord will clearly show that past arms control<CODE-213>5</CODE-213> <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>agreements have strengthened United States securityby requiring the dismantling of large numbers of Soviet missiles. And Ithink this amendment will strengthen United States security by curtailingfurther growth in the Soviet nuclear arsenal.[S11MY8-628]{S5461}DIXONMr. DIXON.

This fact may have been <CODE-213>1</CODE-213>driven <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>home to the Soviets by the signing of the new INFTreaty only seven days after President Reagan delivered his newest, seventhreport to Congress on Soviet SALT violations, which stated: ``The SovietUnion to date has not corrected its noncompliance activity. Indeed, sincethe last report [as recent as March 10, 1987], there has been an additionalcase of Soviet violation of the ABM Treaty . . .''</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The best summation of the Soviet attitude toward treaties was givenby Soviet leaders themselves. As noted, Lenin stated that ``Promises arelike pie crusts, made to be broken.'' Lenin also coldly admitted shortlyafter the March, 1918 Soviet-German peace treaty of Brest-Litovsk that:``Yes, of course we are violating the treaty. We have already violatedit 30 or 40 times.'' But Joseph Stalin most succinctly summarized Sovietdiplomacy, when he made the famous statement that:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">``Words have no relation to actions_otherwise what kind of diplomacyis it?

If we can get some timeagreements, we could get this bill finished by maybe noon or so Friday.I honestly believe that. I think if we worked until 11 or 12 tomorrow night,and then begin Friday morning early, we could finish this bill this weekby the middle of Friday, if we could get some time agreements.As I talk to people around here, I think they are ready to have time agreements.[S11MY8-769]{S5468}NUNNMr. NUNN.

Mr. President, 77 years ago today, on May 11, 1911, the Senatebecome entangled in a bitter deadlock over the election of a presidentpro tempore. This dispute demonstrated a significant change of politicalideology within the early 20<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>th<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> century Congress. In the 1910 mi<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>d<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>term <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>c<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ongressional elections, Democrats had gained a majorityin the House of Representatives and had picked up 10 Senate seat<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>s<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>. This reduced the Republican margin of control to7 votes. The 49 Senate Republicans were split into progressive and conservativewings. Among the progressives where seven insurgents who hoped to topplethe Senate's entrenched old-guard leadership. In this effort, they wereinspired by the success of a recent major revolt in the House. There insurgentshad stripped speaker Joseph Cannon of his power to appoint committees andtheir chairman.On April 27, 1911, shorty after the Senate of the 62d Congress convened,Maine's William Frye resigned as President pro tempore due to illness.Frye had served in that post for 15 years. A man of conservative personaland political temp<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>er<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ament, he was considered one of the ``wheel-horses''of the Senate and was deeply respected by Senators of both parties. On May 11, the Senate began balloting for Frye's replacement. Each partycaucus nominated a senior Member. Republican insur<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>g<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ents divided their votes among four lesser candidates.On each of the seven ballots, Georgia Democrat Augustus Bacon receiveda plurality, but remained several votes short of the necessary majority.The other major candidate, New Hampshire Republican Jacob Gallinger, followedclosely behind. Following several days of rancorous debate, leaders ofboth parties reluctantly agreed to alternate the duties of President protempore between Bacon and Gallinger for the remainder of the 62<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>d<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> Congress.

This isgood news, not only for those two great nations, but also for their NATOallies, including the United States. Yet, much remains to be accomplishedin settling the Cyprus problem.Although I applaud Turkey's leaders for cooperating with Greece in someareas, I am disappointed that they continue to stonewall efforts to endtheir illegal occupation of norther<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>n <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>Cyprus. Other nations and leaders, including theUnited States and its leaders, bear some of the responsibility for thecurrent division of Cyprus.

Just last year, Turkey compounded this problemby sending its occupation forces <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>on<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> Cyprus large amounts of the military assistancewe gave them for NATO defense purposes.Mr. President, I urge the United States Governme<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>nt<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> to help in the resolution of the C<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>yp<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>rus problem by making it clear we will not acceptthe perpetual occupation of 40 percent of Cyprus by Turkey.

Mr. President, I would like to address the topic of adultday care. Too often we have focused our attention and directed our resourcesto institutional care for the infirm elderly. With only 5 percent of theelderly population residing in a nursing home at any given time, it isapparent that we should now direct our attention to community-based alternativeservices. On April 18, 1988, the Senate Committee on Aging held an excellenthearing entitled, ``Adult Day Health Care: A Vital Component of Long-TermCare.'' That hearing underscored the following point: With an aging population,we no longe<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>r<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> can afford to have a fragmented long-term care deliverysystem. The population over age 75 is increasing. These individuals are more likelyto be ``at risk'' from multiple chronic conditions. Adult day care canbe important in keeping older adults in the community. Adult day care also can provide programs to the elderly with cognitiveimpairments, such as Alzheimer's disease. According to one survey by theNational Council on Aging, it was estimated that 2,000 to 3,000 of the10,000 to 15,000 adults currently in adult day care programs suffer fromdementing diseases, such as Alzheimer's and related disorders. But manymore of the estimated 1.5 to 2 million individuals who suffer from thesediseases could be served by adult day care programs. Adult <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>d<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ay care can be a valuable support to family caregivers who provide 80 percent of all health care for the elderly. Elderlyparticipants in adult day care who require continuous supervision are ableto live with spouse or children in their own homes. Adult day care programscan reduce care-giver burnout. Some view this as the most significant factorin nursing home placement. Advocates of adult day care state that this type of service is a cost-effectiveway to deliver care to the elderly. In the State of South Carolina, anadult medical day care package, including physical therapy, meals, nursingcare, personal care services, transportation and recreation, costs $40per day, compared to $60 per day for only physical therapy services providedat home. Although reports from other States such as Hawaii, New Jersey, and Massachusettshave been favorable to adult day care, some public policymakers still questionthe validity of the research data. Extensive and comparable data often are lacking. Comparisons between thecosts of day care and institional and home care are difficult to make becausethe intensity of care provided at each level can vary greatly. Furthermore,costs vary between day care centers serving different kinds of individuals,provide different services or operate at different hours. Lack of adequate transportation may create a barrier to those who are disabledand isolated in the communities. These individuals would benefit from adultday care. Buses may not be designed to carry wheelchairs and buildingsmay not be designed for the disabled. Policymakers have questioned whetheradult care would be cost-effective in reducing admissions to more expensivenursing homes. Although some may view adult day care solely as a respite or home healthservice, many view it as a separate service in the continuum of long-termcare. Adult day care programs are multifaceted, including medical services,counseling, rehabilitation, personal care services, meals, transportation,therapeutic, and recreational services. My visit to an adult day care center at the Huron Area Senior Center inHuron, SD, provided me with an example of an excellent program. By watchingthe activities at the Huron center, I know that adult day care can be ofgreat assistance to both family care givers and participants. Adult day care can assist the elderly to maintain their independence andthe quality of their lives. It can provide a way for the elderly to stayin their own homes in the community. Mr. President, in a nutshell, independence,quality of life, and ties to the community sum up the advantages of adultday care.

Mr. President, the Senate will soon consider the INF Treaty.We will do so when the Soviets have demonstrated that they understand adeal is a deal. The Kremlin must know that in the American system, theSenate's role in treaty-making is a real and independent one, and we willnot stand for any backsliding or fudging when it comes to the stringentverification provisions that are the heart of the INF Treaty.I am confident the Soviets will get the message, and we will proceed toconsider the INF Treaty. That treaty makes a real contribution to Americansecurity and arms control. But I am concerned that the unequal cuts innuclear missiles that treaty imposes on the Soviets may be offset by growthin Soviet strategic forces.The Soviets can cover their INF targets with strategic systems. In fact,I expect that one criticism of the treaty we will hear from its opponentsis that the agreement does not remove the Soviet nuclear threat againstEurope. That is true, but the Soviets must take from their forces aimedat the United States if they want to cover European targets without theirINF missiles.The only way the Soviets can maintain their coverage of European targetsand avoid weakening their nuclear threat against America is by adding totheir strategic forces. And there is no existing arrangement_formal orinformal_that would keep the Soviets from adding to their strategic arsenalto do just that.Last year this Senate adopted an amendment I offered along with my colleaguesSenators <T4>Bumpers, Chafee,</T4> and <T4>Leahy</T4> to preserve some cap on the strategic forces of the UnitedStates and the Soviet Union while a new Strategic Arms Treaty <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>is <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>negotiated. This cap would be the only limit we haveon the arms race until there is a START Treaty in place.Today I join these same colleagues today in offering this amendment tocreate a barrier to Soviet breakout. Our amendment is simple. It requiresthe United States to deploy no more strategic forces than we had on January25, 1988, the day the INF Treaty was submitted to the Senate, so long asthe Soviets do the same.Mr. <CODE-213>1</CODE-213>President, <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>in late 1986, the United States broke out of theold sublimits on strategic weapons both superpowers had observed for 5years. The Soviets continue to stay under those limits. A recent Pentagonpublication put the Soviets 66 under the old informal ceiling.Right now the Soviets continue to destroy existing weapons as new onescome on line. They might continue to do so, no matter what the United Statesdoes. But if they want to exploit what some conservative opponents of theINF Treaty may call a loophole in that treaty, we are giving them the greenlight.If the United States continues to add new submarine missile launchers andconvert B-52 bombers to carry cruise missiles without any restraint, wewill be approximately 22 launchers above our January 1988, level by theend of 1988. This does not give us any military advantage. But it couldgive Moscow the excuse to boost their strategic missile forces to replacethe capability they will lose through INF dismantlements.Our amendment would restore a basis for the two superpowers to limit theirstrategic forces until a START Treaty is achieved. It would fence in possiblegrowth in Soviet forces, growth not limited by any current formal or informalagreement, that otherwise could negate the gains we make under the INFTreaty. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.[S11MY8-801]{S5470}F<ITAG tagnum="66">F</ITAG>[S11MY8-802]{S5470}ELLSWORTH <ITAG tagnum="81">ELLSWORTH AIR FORCE BASE</ITAG>[S11MY8-803]{S5470}PRESSLERMr. PRESSLER.

It is the only SAC base with two squadrons ofB1-B bombers and a strategic training center is now under constructionthere. This center will provide the advanced bomber training for all SACbases.These statistics demonstrate the vital importance of Ellsworth Air ForceBase to our Nation's defense system. In fact, with both the 44th StrategicMissile Wing and the 28th Bombardment Wing, two of the three legs of ourtriad defense system, missiles<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>,<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> and bombers, are located at Ellsworth. The basingof the B1-B bombers at Ellsworth and the location of the strategic trainingcenter there have greatly increased the responsibility given to the base.Given its recent increased responsibilities, Ellsworth's role in the Nation'sdefense network is likely to continue to grow in the future.Earlier this year, I visited Offutt Air Force Base where I received a briefingon the Strategic Air Command. <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>T<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>he <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>i<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>mportance of Ellsworth Air Force Base was repeatedlystressed. I came away from that meeting with an increased sense of pridein South Dakota's role in our national defense, a pride shared by the menand women who serve at Ellsworth and by all the citizens of my State.It has become evident to me that the increased responsibilities entrustedto Ellsworth Air Force Base warrant the presence of a commanding generalat the base. I have been pursuing this matter for some time now.I ask unanimous consent to insert in the <T4>Record</T4> copies of my correspondence to Secretary Aldridge and anarticle which appeared in the Rapid City Journal regarding this issue.Certainly America's largest Strategic Air Command base deserves to be commandedby a general officer.

Mr. President, today Senator <T4>Boschwitz, </T4>Senator <T4>Simon </T4>and I <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>are <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>introducing legislation to revive trade in the GreatLakes region. Wisconsin and other Great Lakes ports are at a competitivedisadvantage because American flag merchant ships no longer call at ourports for international trade. As of April 1 of this year, the cargo preferenceprovision of the Food Security Act mandates that 75 percent of U.S. Governmentcargo be carried on U.S.<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>-<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>flag carriers. This amplifies the disadvantage imposedon Great Lakes exports.So far this shipping season, Great Lakes ports have suffered a loss of$1 million due to diversion of cargo by the Departments <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>o<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>f Agriculture and Transportation from our regionto gulf ports in satisfaction of the 75 percent U.S. carrier requirement.We offer this legislation today in order to entice foreign flag carriersto switch to the American flag and call for U.S. Government cargoes atour ports.Private enterprise would provide U.S. flag service to the Lakes if ourcurrent laws were not so restrictive. The Merchant Marine <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>A<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ct requires a 3 year wait after U.S. flagging ofa foreign vessel before that ship can carry U.S. <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>G<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>overnment cargoes such as the Public Law 480 titleII shipments. This 3 year wait prevents investors from quickly earninga return on the capital expenditures needed for setting up in the shippingservice. My bill proposes waiving the 3 year wait for applicants over thenext 2 years. The number of ships that may reflag under this waiver isrestricted to six. The ships would be serving the Great Lakes ports, withthe exception of two calls per year to other ports, at the close of theGreat Lakes shipping season.This bill would result in specific economic benefits. U.S. shipyards wouldupgrade these vessels as requi<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>r<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ed for national defense purposes. The bill createswork opportun<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>i<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ties in the U.S. shipbuilding industry. In addditionit requires the use of U.S. crews.The Great Lakes offers transport efficiencies which can make U.S. exportsmore competitive, depending on the type of product involved, its sourceand destination. For example, agriculture shipping costs are lower duringthe months when the Lakes/Seaway waterway is open.The Great Lakes/Seaway provides an important waterway for the United States.Both for strategic and commercial reasons, it is urgent that the UnitedStates have at least some on-going U.S.<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>-<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>flag cargo carrying capacity out of the Lakes.

Mr. President, as you may know, 1987 marked the40th anniversary of the launching of the Marshall plan, a chapter in ourhistory of which we can all be proud. Few people realize that our Nation has a documentary motion picture recordof the Marshall plan's achievements. Over 100 films were produced in Europeby the Marshall plan agencies, but unfortunately, these films are not availablein the United States_not to American historians, not to educators, notto the general public.I am introducing legislation that would allow these films to be seen inthe United States.

Today, all 50 States have ad<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>op<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ted a minimum drinking age of 21, eliminating ``bloodborders.'' A study by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administrationfound that over an 18-month period, almost 850 young lives were saved,largely due to the increased minimum drinking age.But the battle against drunk driving is far from over. A drunk drivingfat<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>a<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>lity occurs every 22 minutes in this country. Drunkdriving has to be reduced among drivers of all ages.An essential component of our continuing efforts must be enhanced enforcementof Federal, State, and local laws. Our bill would help States meet thatgoal.The bill would authorize Federal seed money to States to help establishself-sustaining drunk driving prevention programs. In order to be eligiblefor this program, States would have to put into place a self-supportingenforcement program, under which fines and surcharges collected from individualsconvicted of drunk driving are returned to communities for enforcement.States would also have to adopt laws that provide for the prompt suspensionor revocation of the license of a driver found to be driving under theinfluence of alcohol. A recent study released by the Insurance Institutefor Highway Safety [IIHS] showed that such laws reduce drunk driving fatalitiesby 9 percent.In addition to being eligible for grants under these two basic requirements,States could also receive supplemental funds for adoption of either orboth of the following procedures: First, a means of making drivers licensesof those under the legal drinking age readily distinguishable from thoseof drivers of legal drinking age; and second, the mandatory blood alcoholtesting of drivers involved in fatal or serious accidents.Finally, the bill would direct the Secretary of Transportation to commissiona study by the National Academy of Sciences on the appropriate blood alcoholconcentration at which a driver should be deemed to be under the influenceof alcohol.Mr. President, the importance of this legislation is apparent to anyonewho has suffered the loss of a loved one.<ITAG tagnum="80">This morning, I listened to the tragic story of Bob Gore. Mr. Gorewas vacationing in Hawaii with his 24-year-old son and daughter, when hischildren were killed by a drunk driver. This was not the first time thatdriver had been guilty of driving drunk. But he was still able to drinkand drive. <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>T<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>hat is an outrage that must be corrected. That'swhat this bill would do. </ITAG>That drunk driver has now been convicted of manslaughter in the death ofthe Gores. But in the 15 months between their deaths and the conviction,he was allowed to go on driving. In fac<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>t<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>, Mr. Gore told us that the last thing the convictedkiller of his children did before leaving the courtroom was to turn overhis drivers license. If that had been done after his earlier transgressions,perhaps that tragedy might never have happened. Nothing can be done to bring lost loved ones back. But we can take stepsto keep tragedies like the one that killed the Gores from happening t<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>o<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> other famil<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>i<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>es. I want to commend Mr. Gore for his commitmentto this effort. He's turning his personal grief into a positive force,trying to spare others. For that, he deserves to be commended.

Mr. Presi<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>d<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ent, I am pleased to join Senator <T4>Lautenberg </T4>in sponsoring the Drunk Driving Prevention Act of 1988.Its goal is an important one_stopping drunk drivers from killing and injuringinnocent citizens. We have made some progress in the fight against drunk driving. Accordingto the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, in 1982, 25,170Americans were killed in alcohol<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>-<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>related crashes. In 1987, there were an estimated23,500 alcohol-related fatalities, a decrease of 7 percent. How did we make this progress? One way we made progress was by encouragingStates to pass tough laws to combat drunk driving. In 1982, I authored,with Senator <T4>Pell, </T4>legislation to provide States incentive grants if they passeda law with each of the following provisions: First, a provision requiringprompt license suspension for a minimum period of 90 days on the firstoffense and for 1-year on the second offense; second, a provision establishinga 0.10 percent blood alcohol content [BAC] per se intoxication standard;and third, a provision requiring a jail sentence of 48 hours or <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>at <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>least 10 days of community service on<CODE-213>5</CODE-213> <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>the second drunk driving offense within 5 years.To date, 16 States have qualified for these grants by passing laws withthe required provisions. In 1984, we took further steps to fight drunk driving. We passed the NationalMinimum Drinking Age Act. Since that legislation's enactment, all 50 Stateshave adopted a minimum drinking age of 21. The States' adoption of theminimum drinking age has eliminated ``blood borders''_areas where youngpeople would drive across State lines to buy alcohol. The 1984 legislationalso included provisions I authored expanding the 1982 incentive grantprogram to include States using gra<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>n<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ts to prevent drugged driving and to provide grantsto States who update and computerize their traffic record keeping systems<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>.<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> Even wit<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>h<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> these stronger laws, alcohol is involved in thedeaths of over 50 percent of those killed in highway crashes. We have madesome progress, but we are far from satisfied. We must take further stepsto combat drunk driving. Mr. President, our bill would authorize Federal seed money for States thatenact and enforce laws shown to be effective weapons in the fight againstdrunk driving. There would be two requirements for receiving a basic grantunder this legislation. First, a State would have to establish a self-supportive prevention programunder which fines collected from convicted drunk drivers would be returnedto communities for enforcement. Second, a State would have to adopt an administrative per se law underwhich a police officer could immediately confiscate a drunk driver's licenseat the point of arrest. Such a law removes a demonstrated hazard from thehighways. A recently released Insurance Institute for Highway Safety studyfound that such laws reduce drunk driving fatalities by 9 percent in thoseStates that adopt them. The bill would enable States to receive supplemental funds for meetingeither or both of the following requirements: First, making the drivers'licenses of those under the legal drinking age readily distinguishablefrom the licenses of drivers of legal drinking age; and second, requiringblood alcohol content testing of drivers involved in fatal or serious accidents.In addition, our bill would require the Secretary of Transportation tocommission a study by the National Academy of Sciences on the BAC levelat which a driver should be deemed to be under the influence of alcohol.Mr. President, this drunk driving prevention bill has the support of MothersAgainst Drunk Driving and the National Safety Council. With their supportand with the support of our colleagues, we can help to stop the unnecessaryslaughter of innocent people on our highways.andCx.1;<CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213><CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213><CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213><CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213><CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213><CODE-213>1</CODE-213></ITAG>[S11MY8-896]<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>{S5475}<CODE-213>1</CODE-213>CHAFEE<ITAG tagnum="10"><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>andCx.1; Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, we all know ofthe tragedies resulting from drunk driving. Too often, I pick up the newspaperand read about the suffering caused by drunk drivers: the tremendous lossof human potential, the promising lives cut short, and the families tornapart by senseless tragedy. Alcohol abuse has become an increasing problemin this country. The costs of this abuse are clearly magnified in the transportationsector. When operators of a car, truck, or bus drink and drive, they endangernot only their own lives, but the lives of passengers entrusted to theircare, other motorists and even innocent bystanders.<CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>The Congress has not let these tragedies go unnoticed.In 1984, we approved the National Uniform Minimum Drinking Age Act. Thatlegislation highlighted the need to unify minimum drinking ages acrossState borders. Since its passage, all 50 States have adopted a minimumdrinking age of 21. The uniformity of the minimum drinking age has gonea long way to reducing the incidence of drunk driving, a leading causeof death among our young people.<CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>It is important to remember that the incidence ofdrunk driving crosses all age groups and economic backgrounds.

In order to be eligible for a grant,States would have to establish programs under which fines and surchargescollected from individuals convicted of drunk driving would be returnedto communities for enforcement. In addition, the proposal requires Statesto provide for an expedited driver's license suspension or revocation system.This second provision is essential to deter individuals from driving whileunder the influence of alcohol. Drunk drivers must know that they willbe prosecuted and that their licenses will be revoked in timely fashion.<CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>In addition, under this legislation, <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>St<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ates will be eligible for supplemental grants if:first, law enforcement officers are required to test for blood alcoholcontent whenever they have probable cause to believe that a driver involvedin a collision resulting in the loss of human life or serious injury, hadcommitted an alcohol-related traffic offense; and second, there is establishedan effective system for preventing drivers under age 21 from obtainingalcoholic beverages.

Mr. President, I am today introducing the MainStreet Fair Competition Act. The bill would assist State and local governmentsin collecting sales taxes due on interstate mail-order sales and providejustice for the Main Street small business<CODE-213>5</CODE-213> <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>which compete with these mail-order firms.As chairman of the Senate Small Business Committee, I know the problemsthat Main Street small businesses have in surviving the intense competitionthey face from large, multistate firms. This competition is tough enough,but it is simply unfair that some of their competitors, specifically out-of-Statemail-order firms, are able to avoid collecting State sales taxes on theirmail-order sales and can sell products on a tax-free basis.</ITAG>[S11MY8-899]{S5475}no new tax<ITAG tagnum="89">no new tax is imposed</ITAG>The issue here is collection of sales taxes which already are legally dueto State and local government. The problem is that sales taxes cannot nowbe collected when the customer has purchased the item from an out-of-Statemail-order firm. This bill does not impose any new sales tax. It simplypermits collection of taxes which now go uncollected.The State and local governments have no difficulty collecting sales taxeswhen the item is bought from a Main Street small business<CODE-213>5</CODE-213> w<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>hich is located within the State. Local small businesses,including local mail-order firms, must include the State and local salestaxes in the purchase price for all the items they sell. They must thenremit the proceeds of the tax to the State or local governmental unit.Every small business located in a State is involved in collection of salestaxes. There is nothing new or unusual about it. There are well-establishedprocedures for collecting the tax, accounting for the taxes which are collectedand remitting the tax to the State or local government. Local small businessesare even   <ITAG tagnum="80">compensated by the State for serving as part of the State tax collectionsystem. They can earn some income from the float on the sales taxes theycollect until these taxes are remitted to the State. There is no controversyabout the obligation of local small businesses to collect sales taxes.</ITAG>This routine collection procedure does not, however, currently apply wherethe business does not maintain a store or plant within the State. Undera Supreme Court ruling, the Bellas Hess case, State and local governmentscannot now require an out-of-State mail-order firm to collect and remitthe taxes when it mails the purchased item to citizens residing in thatState or local jurisdiction. The Court found that mailing the item didnot <CODE-213>1</CODE-213>constitute enough <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>of a ``<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>nexus<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>'' with the State to give the State the power torequire the firm to collect sales taxes on the transaction.This is an obvious loophole in the sales tax collection system and itspractical effect is to prevent collection of the taxes by any governmententity.State and local governments could try to collect these <CODE-213>1</CODE-213>sales <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>taxes directly from the customer of the out-of-Statemail-order firm, but this is quite impractical. Can you imagine a Stateor local government requiring its citizens to report all purchases fromout-of-State mail-order firms and to pay the applicable sales taxes eachyear when they file their income tax forms? States could require this,but it's an absurd prospect.The fact is that without the assistance from the out-of-State mail-orderfirm, the State cannot collect the sales taxes on purchases from thesefirms.When these sales taxes go uncollected by the State where the customer resides,no sales taxes are ever collected on these transactions. The State wherethe mail-order firm is located collects no sales taxes on these purchases.The State where the item is mailed is unable to collect the sales taxes.These sales simply fall between the cracks and are never <CODE-213>1</CODE-213>taxed <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>by anyone. The result is a national loss in salestax revenue to State and local governments.I am sure that most persons who buy an item from an out-of-State mail-orderfirm believe t<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ha<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>t no sales taxes is due to the State or local governmentin which they reside. I would think that some people buy items from out-of-Statemail-order firms precisely because they believe <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>that <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>they are not obligated to pay any sales taxes.This is a <CODE-213>1</CODE-213>misconception <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>which mail-order firms undoubtedly foster. Indeed,at some point in the legislative process, I would not be surprised to seemail-order firms launch an advertising campaign trying to convince theircustomers that this <CODE-213>1</CODE-213>bill <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>or other bills on this issue are imposing some newtaxes. Any such representations would be false and I trust that mail-orderfirms will think twice before they make any false statements regardingthis issue.The truth of the matter is that sales taxes are <CODE-213>1</CODE-213>due <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>on all of these sales irrespective of whether theitem is purchased from a <CODE-213>1</CODE-213>Main <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>Street small business or from an out-of-State mail-orderfirm. With respect to purchases from a mail-order firm, the customer simplynever <CODE-213>1</CODE-213>receives <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>any bill for the sales taxes which are due, eitherfrom the mail-order firm or directly from the State or local jurisdiction.[S11MY8-900]{S5476}unfair com<ITAG tagnum="89">unfair competition for small businesses</ITAG>When the sales of out-of-State mail-order firms are not taxed, the mail-orderfirm gains a significant competitive advantage over <CODE-213>1</CODE-213>Main <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>Street small businesses which must collect the tax.Americans have a natural aversion to taxes, to income taxes, to sales taxes,all excise taxes, to all taxes. Everyone seems to have pride when theycan gain the biggest refund on their income tax return. We love to gripeabout the tax burden. We happily elected an administration committed todrastically cutting Federal income tax rates and were unconcerned thatthis would lead inevitably <CODE-213>1</CODE-213>to <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>the huge budget deficits.<CODE-213>1</CODE-213>When <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>a customer of a mail-order firm avoids paying salestaxes, he or she may feel that he or she has received a special tax<ITAG tagnum="80">break. It's exciting to be able to avoid paying taxes. The avoidanceof sales taxes constitut<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>e<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>s a minor victory over the whole tax collection system.</ITAG>But, this tax avoidance is unfair to the Main Street small businesses whichmust collect taxes from their customers. What happens is that the smallbusiness on Main Street finds that its prices are automatically 4 or 5percent higher than those of a mail-order firm. The mail-order firm alwayshas a built-in, guaranteed price advantage on the price of the item. Thisis unfair, and the Federal Government should step in to put all businesseson the same competitive footing.Competition among retailers should not be artifically biased in favor ofmail-order firms just because of a quirk in the ability of States to collectsales taxes. Businesses should compete based on the quality of their productsand service and the cost to the consumer. This is competition we want andshould encourage. It is fundamental to the free enterprise system. A smallnumber of businesses should not be given an automatic, contrived, inadvertent,and unfair competitive advantage because of a quirk in the law.Ironically, the mail-order sales tax loophole gives interstate mail-orderfirms a competitive advantage over intrastate mail-order firms. The loopholeonly applies to sales to customers in a State where the firm has no plantor store. It does not apply to mail-order sales in the same State wherethe firm has facilities. So, the loophole only helps interstate mail-orderfirms and it hurts intrastate mail-order firms just as much as it hurtsMain Street small businesses which have no mail-order business.[S11MY8-901]{S5476}benefits t<ITAG tagnum="89">benefits to state and local governments</ITAG>The issue here is important to State and local governments. With many cutbacksin Federal aid, State and local governments are strapped to raise the revenuethey need to provide services to their citizens. Indeed, it is in the interestof all citizens that their State and local government be able to collectall the taxes which are due.To the extent that State and local government sales taxes cannot be collected,the taxes on all the citizens and businesses in the State must be raised.There is no reason why the lost revenue on out-of-State mail-order salesshould be made up by citizens irrespective of whether or not they chooseto make purchases from mail-order firms.It is estimated that my State of Arkansas loses $16 million in sales taxrevenue on interstate mail-order sales, one of the highest revenue lossesof any State in terms of the percentage of sales tax revenue collected.If these taxes could be collected, the State of Arkansas can use the fundsto improve education and roads and other important purposes. It might evenbe able to reduce some of the taxes it imposes on individuals and businesseswithin the State. State officials in Arkansas_and every other State_stronglysupport eliminating this loophole for mail-order firms.Nationwide it is estimated that $2.5 billion in sales tax goes uncollecteddue to the mail-order loophole. This $2.5 billion could be used by Stateand local communities to help fight drug addiction, provide assistanceto small businesses, or clean up the environment.It also is important to collect sales taxes on all sales to avoid shenanigansand sham transactions. Living here in the District of Columbia we havetwo adjacent jurisdictions. It is possible to buy an item in Chevy Chase,MD, and have it shipped two blocks away to Friendship Heights in the Districtand avoid paying sales taxes. This makes no sense and it spawns effortsto circumvent the payment of taxes, particularly on luxury items wherethe sales tax is particularly heavy or where there is a <ITAG tagnum="80">substantial differential in the sales taxes which are imposed in onejurisdiction bordering another.</ITAG>[S11MY8-902]{S5476}federal in<ITAG tagnum="89">federal interest in helping the states</ITAG>The Federal Government has several different interests in the mail-ordersales tax loophole issue. This is not simply a State and local governmentissue.The Federal Government has an interest in anything which reduces the abilityof State and local governments to fund needed social programs. If Stateand local governments must cut back on service delivery, there will bea stronger demand for increased Federal Government programs to addressthe same problem. State and local governments will demand greater financialsupport so that they can avoid cutting back on these programs.As I have said, the issue here is whether $2.5 billion in State and localsales taxes can be collected. This is a large amount of revenue, even byFederal standards. We have had tens of hours of debate in the Congressabout cutting revenue sharing programs by amounts much less than this.We are talking here about an action on the <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>part<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> of the Federal Government which can provide $2.5billion in assistance to State and local governments.Just as important, the Federal Government has a duty to assist State andlocal governments. This is particularly true when this is an area whereState and local governments cannot help themselves. As a matter of comity,the Federal Government should be helpful.There is no <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>Fe<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>deral <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>Go<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>vernment interest which conflicts with that of theState and local governments. There no longer exists a deduction on the<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>Fe<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>deral income tax form for State and local sales taxes.If that deductio<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>n st<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ill existed, increasing the amount of local salestax collected would increase the amount of sales tax deductions, deprivingthe Federal Government of some amount of revenue. But with the demise ofthe sales tax deduction, there is no adve<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>rs<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>e impact of this legislation on the Federal Government.For the Federal Government, this legislation is a matter of self-interest,comity, and fairness. The Federal Government has its own revenue problems,but this does not mean that the Federal Government should ignore the revenueproblems of State and local governments.[S11MY8-903]{S5477}collection<ITAG tagnum="89">collection procedure for sales taxes</ITAG>What my bill would do is give States the power to require out-of-Statemail-order firms to begin collecting State and local sales taxes.This requirement will put out-of-State mail-order firms on the same footingwith local merchants on Main Street and it will eliminate the artificialdistinction between in-State and out-of-State mail-order sales.By requiring the out-of-State mail-order firm to collect the sales taxes,States will not be tempted to begin requiring the c<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>usto<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>mers of these firms to keep records on his or herpurchases and to pay the taxes to the State himself. This requirement ensuresthat the taxes will be paid. It gives no special tax advantage to any particulartype of retailer. It promotes fair competition based on cost, quality,and service.In drafting this legislation, I was concerned that this requirement mightimpose a huge paperwork burden on the out-of-State mail-order firm. But,as I have said, these firms already must collect sales taxes on all salesto States where the firm has offices or facilities. This requires themto keep two sets of books_one on sales where no sales tax is collectedand one on sales where sales taxes are collected. I would doubt if thereis any mail-order firm which does not now already collect some sales taxes.I was also concerned that this requirement would be confusing to the customersof ou<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>t<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>-of-State mail-order firms. But, mail-order salesforms already include a line which says something like ``add 4 percentsales tax if you live in Arkansas.'' My legislation would simply requireth<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>at<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> all customers fill in this line. The mail-orderfirm can easily p<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>rov<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ide a small chart listing the applicable sales taxfor each State. Or, if the item is charged on a credit card,<CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213><CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213><CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213><CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213><CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213><CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213><CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213><ITAG tagnum="80">the mail-order firm could fill in the amount of the applicable salestax for the customer.</ITAG>For the large mail-order firms, all of these items are handled by computers.If the order contains the address of the customer_and let us hope thatit does_then the computer can be made to automatically fill in the applicablesales tax.The legislation requires the mail-order firm to collect one<CODE-213>5</CODE-213> <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>set rate of sales tax for each State. If the Statehas a State sales tax, that tax must be collected. If the State also empowerslocal communities to collect a local sales tax, the legislation requiresthat this local tax be added <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>to <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>the States sales tax rate and does not require thatit be collected separately.This avoids the apparent nightmare of requiring the mail-order f<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>i<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>rm to collect each and every one of the approximately6,400 local sales taxes which are imposed in the United States. It wouldseem to be unreasonable to require a mail-order firm to determine the amountof any local sales tax and this legislation does not require it to do so.There will be only one rate of tax per State and that is the rate of taxwhich is collected for any sale in that State.I would say that this apparent nightmare might not exist in practice. Thereare now available computer programs which would automatically fill in theamount of any app<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>lic<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>able local sales tax. As long as the mail-order firmknows the ZIP Code of the customer, the computer would do the rest. Ofcourse, this would not help if the customer is paying by check and mustdetermine the amount of the local sales tax but it would work where thecustomer is charging the purchases. But, as I have said, this legislationavoids this problem altogether.Mail-order firms covered by the legislation are required to remit the salestax<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>e<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>s on a quarterly basis. Most Main Street small businessesmust remit sales taxes on a monthly basis. This means that the out-of-Statefirm would have a greater ability to benefit from the float on the salestax funds than a Main Street firm. It also means that the legislation imposesless paperwork burden on the out-of-State firm. In addition, it may bepossible to require all States to agree on one sales tax remittance form.The legislation does not require this, but we may want to see if this couldbe done.[S11MY8-904]{S5477}impact on <ITAG tagnum="89">impact on customers of mail<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>-<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>order firms</ITAG>I anticipat<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>e <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>that some persons who rely heavily on mail-orderpurchases will be concerned about this proposal. For example, some elderlypersons and those who are unable to purchase certain items locally mayrely on mail-order purchases.My legislation would simply say that these persons should pay sales taxeson their purchases just as their neighbors are required to do when theywalk into a local store. Everyone should have every opportunity to utilizemail-order catalogs for their purchases, but there is no reason why theyshould be able to avoid paying sales taxes on these purchases.There are many commercial benefits of mail-order sales which will morethan support a thriving mail-order sales industry whether or not salestaxes are collected on all of their sales instead of just some of them.These firms will not cease operations simply because they must begin collectingsales taxes on their sales.Sales taxes are regressive. They tend to hit hardest at persons at thelow end of the income scale. I have strongly resisted proposals here inthe Congress to increase excise taxes and I have strongly supported effortsto maintain the progressivity of the Federal income tax. On the mail-order<CODE-213>5</CODE-213> sales tax <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>issue, we are dealing mostly with middle-income orupper-income individuals.Mail-order firms mail their catalogs to customers with the highest incomes.Their mailing lists may come from companies which issue credit cards orthey may come based on households in affluent neighborhoods. I doubt ifthere are many low-income individuals on the mailing lists of mail-orderfirms or many who have credit cards. The mail-order business does not,and never will, cater to low-income individuals.There are some firms, like Sears, which have major catalog operations whichare patron<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>iz<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ed by middle-income individuals. But Sears has storesin every State, or nearly every State, and it already is required to collectsales taxes on its mail-order sales.<ITAG tagnum="80"><CODE-213>5</CODE-213>I<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>t cannot avoid collecting sales taxes. And it certainlyis doing well in the mail-order business. It<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>s <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>customers don't complain or take <CODE-213>1</CODE-213>their <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>busi<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ne<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ss elsewhere because sales taxes are collected. </ITAG>When all sales taxes are collected, State and local governments are betterable to maintain services for their citizens. Low-income citizens benefitgreatly from State and local government programs. They have a strong interestin the collection of all revenue due to the State. They may pay some moresales taxes when they purchase items from mail-order firms, but they benefitmuch more from the services which the State is able to provide. On a netbasis, this legislation is a good deal for them.[S11MY8-905]{S5477}collection<ITAG tagnum="89">collection of local sales taxes</ITAG>The question of local sales taxes is a complicated one. I have alreadyexplained that this legislation permits collection of some local salestaxes as long as mail-order firms are required to collect only one rateof tax per State. This legislation addresses the issue of how the Statesdetermines what this local sales tax rate should be.There currently is an effort to resolve a number of important issues betweenState and local officials about how to set this local sales tax componentof the mail-order <CODE-213>1</CODE-213>sales <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>tax. In my view, it is unreasonable to require thata mail-order firm collect each and every one of the 6,400 local sales taxes.But, there are some thorny issues about how they determine what rate oflocal sales tax is collected.There is no problem if every local jurisdiction in the <CODE-213>1</CODE-213>State <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>collects the exact same amount of local sales tax.If the State has a 0.04 cent sales tax and every local jurisdic<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>t<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ion<CODE-213>5</CODE-213> <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>collects a 0.01 cent sales tax, then the mail-orderfirm should collect 0.05 cents in sales taxes. This is an easy case andthere is no difficulty in collecting <CODE-213>1</CODE-213>all <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>the local sales taxes which are imposed in the State.It would be unwise for the Federal Government to force States to requirethat every local jurisdication collect the same rate of local sales tax.If the legislation stated that local sales taxes could only be collectedwhen they are uniform throughout the State, there would be pressure onlocal jurisdictions to agree to one uniform local sales tax rate. If theycould not reach agreement, they could receive no proceeds of the salestaxes collected from mail-order firms. That would be a painful choice andone that would pit larger jurisdictions against smaller ones.There are not many States where every single local jurisdiction collectsthe exact same amount in local sales taxes. In Arkansas, for example, localjurisdictions may levy a sales tax of 0.01 cent or 0.02 cents. Very fewof them collect 0.02 cents in local sales tax, but some do. And there aresome local jur<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>is<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>dictions which do not collect even 0.01 cent in localsales tax. If this legislation required that all local taxes be uniform,few if any States would qualify and little if any local sales tax wouldbe collected.The legislation addresses the issue of variable local sales taxes in animaginative way. It States that if a majority of the local jurisdictionscollect<CODE-213>5</CODE-213> a <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>local sales tax, the <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>S<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>tate may collect <CODE-213>1</CODE-213>``the <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>lowest rate of local sales tax which * * <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>*<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> local jurisdictions may impose.'' In the case ofArkansas, this would mean that the State could collect 0.01 cents in localsales tax because a majority of the jurisdictions in Arkansas impose somelocal sales tax and 0.01 cents is the lowest rate of tax <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>that <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>may be imposed. Local jur<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>is<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>d<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>i<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>cti<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>o<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ns cannot impose <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>a <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>0.005<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>-<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>cent local sales tax.This provision does not permit the State to collect all the local salestaxes which are due. It permits collection of some of the local sales taxeswhich are due. Mail-order firms are given some tax relief by this provision,as compared to Main Street small businesses. This is a ``rough justice''provision. It avoids the problem of requiring collection of 6,400 differenttaxes, but it also avoids requiring every local <CODE-213>1</CODE-213>jurisdiction <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>in a State to collect the exact same rate of localsales tax.There is one additional issue which arises once the State has collectedsome local sales taxes from a mail-order firm and that is how these taxproceeds are distributed to the local <CODE-213>1</CODE-213>jurisdictions. <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>The <CODE-213>1</CODE-213>legislation <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>states simply that the system for distributing<ITAG tagnum="80">these proceeds must be ``substantially the same as the system by whichthe State distributes the receipts of other local sales taxes which itcollects and administers.'' </ITAG>Most local sales taxes are, in fact, collected by the State Government.Local jurisdictions simply piggy-back their local sales taxes on the Statesales tax collection system. This is the most efficient way for local jurisidctionsto collect their local sales taxes and it imposes the least burden on thebusinesses which collect the tax. This means that there already existsand agreed-upon system for the State to remit the proceeds of this salestax collection to the local jurisdictions. The legislation would requirethat States use the same or a substantially similar system for distributingthe proceeds of the sales taxes collected from mail-order firms.[S11MY8-906]{S5478}impact on <ITAG tagnum="89">impact on small mail order firms </ITAG>I have been emphasizing the concerns of Main Street small businessses,but, of course, there are many small mail-order businesses. My proposalis directed as providing justice to Main Street small businesses, but wemust ensure that we do not impose an unfair burden on small mail-orderbusinesses. To avoid this result, I have set a minimum sales threshold of $15 millionin my bill. This exempts every small mail-order firm and many which arequite large.[S11MY8-907]{S5478}border cit<ITAG tagnum="89">border city sales tax laws </ITAG>Finally, we have one special situation in Arkansas which needs to be co<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>v<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ered in the legislation. We have a city in Arkansaswhich is exempt from the <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>s<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>tatewide sales tax because it sits on the borderwith Texas, which takes a different approach on local sales tax. In lieuof paying this sales tax, the State collects an additional amount of incometax. This is an entirely legitimate response of the State to a special situation.Under my bill, this local situation would not deny to Arkansas the abilityto quality under the terms of the legislation. It would not require Arkansasto repeal this local law in order to qualify.[S11MY8-908]{S5478}need for c<ITAG tagnum="89">need for constructive debate </ITAG>Undoubtedly there are other issues which need to be reviewed as we drafta mail-order sales tax bill. Unfortunately, the debate thus far is moreon the overall concept than on issues of implementation. It always is a temptation for interest groups to first oppose a proposaland then to discuss compromises and details when they may not be able toprevent a bill from passing. I would hope that groups which are concernedabout th<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>is<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> proposal would be willing and able to offer constructiveproposals on how to administer the collection of sales taxes on mail-ordersales and how to minimize the burden on mail-order firms and their customers.The inability of State and local governments to collect sales taxes onout-of-State mail-order sales is a legitimate issue. The small businesscommunity is becoming aroused about the unfair competition they see frommail-order firms. This issue will not go away. It is time to discuss the specific terms oflegislation to close this loophole. There are legitimate issues to resolve,and I hope that introducing this legislation will advance the debate onthese issues.andCx.1;<CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213><CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213><CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213><CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213><CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213><CODE-213>1</CODE-213><ITAG tagnum="9">0[S11MY8-909]{S5478}CONRAD</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">andCx.1; Mr. CONRAD.

Underthe Supreme Court's ruling in a 1967 case, National Bellas Hess versusIllinois Department of Revenue, State and local governments cannot requirean out-of-State mail order firm to remit sales taxes on purchases by residentsof their <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>S<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>tate or local jurisdiction. <CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>In two decades since this decision was handed down,mail order firms have enjoyed impressive growth and popularity. Catalogsales have soared, and direct marketers have also turned to sophisticatedcommercials, telephone contracts and other techniques to generate $150billion of business a year.

The 1986 tax reform law, by repealingthe deduction for State and local sales taxes, gives mail order firms afurther advantage. As the market<CODE-213>5</CODE-213> <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>has been thoroughly transformed by these developments,the tax law as defined by the Bellas Hess case has be<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>c<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ome a relic fr<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>o<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>m days gone by. <CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>States and localities across the country are strappedfor revenues to meet pressing public needs.

Mr. President, Congress has been criticizedby the members of the Brady Commission and others for not enacting legislationto respond to last October's stock market crash. I agree with the BradyCommission members that the stock market crash was a frightening event_onethat deserves our careful attent<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ion<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>. However, I do not share their sense of alarm overthe fact that there has been no legislative response. I think the only way to respond to the problems highlighted by the crashis carefully and deliberately. A quick-fix solution directed solely atthe operation of our markets duplicates the efforts of the President'sWorking Group_whose recommendations will be made next week_and, even moreimportantly, is very unlikely to prevent future episodes of volatility.Th<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>e<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> Washington Post made this point very persuasivelyin an editorial in their Saturday edition entitled ``Remember the Crash?''The Post pointed out that while ``the financial markets' defects, as thecrash revealed them, are `still in place and need to be addressed'. ***The delay<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>_<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>in responding<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>_<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>is not as outrageous as it looks.'' The Post goes on to point out that ``the remedies are not entirely obvious,and there's a strong case for moving cautiously.'' The Post concludes that``financial market reform belongs on the lengthening list of things probablybest left until next January.'' I share this view. I think we make a real mistake by acting too hastily.In spite of the many studies that have been done, we still do not understandenough about the fundamental changes that have occurred in our financialmarkets over the many years since our basic regulatory structure was setup, and that makes it difficult to fashion a proper response quickly. Wehave spent the last 6 years working on legislation amending the Glass-SteagallAct, which would enhance the power of bank holding companies to participatein many, but not all, securities activities. Congress has still not completedaction on that issue. It is unreasonable, it seems to me, to suggest thatwe should act within 6 months on market reform. I urge my colleagues in both the House and the Senate to take the Posteditorial to heart. I think Congress <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>should <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>focus its attention on the fundamental changes thathave occurred in the marketplace, rather than trying to fashion a quick-fixsolution that simply will not and cannot do the job. Mr. President, I askthat the Post editorial be included at this point in the <T4>Record</T4>. The article follows: </ITAG>[S11MY8-984]{S5482}[From the <ITAG tagnum="71">[From the Washington Post, May 7, 1988] </ITAG>[S11MY8-985]{S5482}Remembert<ITAG tagnum="74">Remember the Crash? </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">When the Brady Commission gave President Reagan its report five monthsago on the October stock market crash, it expected to see action. Instead,the White House backed apprehensively away from the idea of expanded regulation.The regulators began quarreling over jurisdiction. And in Congress thesense of urgency cooled rapidly as stock prices leveled off and the economystrengthened. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Now the Brady Commission has published a statement reminding the worldthat the financial markets' defects, as the crash revealed them, are ``stillin place and need to be addressed.'' That's true, but perhaps the delayis not quite so outrageous as it looks. The remedies are not entirely obvious,and there's a strong case for moving cautiously. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="52">1<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>It's in the nature of financial mar<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ket<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>s to swing up and down sharply, particularly in acountry with growing debts and an unstable currency. The proper purposeof the reforms is not to prevent a downswing but to ensure that when itstarts, it will not begin to feed on itself by generating malfunctionsand bankruptcies that in turn make the market fall farther. The commissionputs great emphasis on what it calls circuit breakers_that is, brief haltsin trading to let people settle their accounts and let the panic evaporate.But the usefulness of trading halts is far from clear. The October crash,after all, took p<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>la<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ce over six days (including a weekend) in which thepanic only mounted. Perhaps the circuit-breaker proposal will turn outto be helpful, but it belongs to the category of advice that needs to beconsidered carefully and tested. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Most of the Brady reforms require legislation, and the commissionsaid last week that it would be a mistake not to keep pushing Congressto move. That, unfortunately, is also questionable. It's too late in thiscongressional year, and in this administration, for careful legislation.Particularly in the House of Representatives, the unmanageable turf strugglesamong the committees, and the nature of the committees to which financiallegislation would be referred, suggest that the final product would beneither prompt nor reliably useful. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">When the Brady report ap<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>p<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>eared in January, the administration wasted two valuablemonths before setting up its internal working group, headed by Undersecretaryof the Treasury George Gould and including some of the regulators, to developits own position. Mr. Gould and his colleagues are to report within a fewweeks.

She had worked in a chemical laboratory in an institute underthe Ministry of Geology, but was never involved in secret work. This wasconfirmed in writing to OVIR during the processing of their visa application.Furthermore, without such confirmation, Soviet officials would never haveissued the original exit permits to the family. It should also go withoutsaying that Gita had been retired from work for many years, which wouldhave made any information obsolete.So, the Stolars remained in the Soviet Union stripped of their Soviet citizenshipand belongings.

Mr. President, several months ago I became awareof the Interior Department's intention to solve an endangered species problemby destroying vast areas of vital wetland habitat in northwestern Nevada.The Stillwater National Wildlife Refuge, and thousands of acres of State-managedwildlife areas that surround it, are to be sacrificed to provide more waterto the endangered cui-ui fish of Pyramid Lake. While I have nothing againstthe cui-ui, I am absolutely amazed that the Interior Department reads theEndangered Species Act as forcing it to take an action that will destroyfish and wildlife habitat of such significance to Nevada, the United States,and indeed the Western Hemisphere. About 18,000 acres of vital wetlandhabitat will just dry up and blow away. The elevated levels of boron andarsenic in the remaining 7,000 acres of previously productive habitat willturn it into a toxic death trap for any birds foolish enough to venturenear.The wetland habitat in question is very important in the Pacific flyway,and is part of the International Hemispheric Reserve for Shorebirds. What'smore, several species of birds that use these wetlands are considered sensitiveby the Fish and Wildlife Service. This means they could become federallylisted as threatened or endangered in the foreseeable future. These sensitivebirds are the white-faced ibis, western snowy plover, American white pelican,Swainson's hawk, and the yellow-billed cuckoo. Speaking of cuckoos, takingan action to protect one endangered species that, in the process, possiblypushes five other species over the edge onto the endangered species list,is just about the most cuckoo thing I have ever heard of.If that is truly what a reasonable interpretation of the Endangered SpeciesAct forces the Interior Department to do, then something is very wrongwith the Endangered Species Act.Because of the value of the resources at stake here, I felt compelled severalmonths ago to place a hold on the bill to reauthorize the Endangered SpeciesAct as a way of focusing attention on the importance of the wetlands, andthe fish and wildlife resources dependent on them. I hoped that this attentionwould result in a solution to the threat facing these resources.Since placing a hold on the bill, my office has received considerable cooperationand assistance from the staffs of the Committee on Environment and PublicWorks, and <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>the <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>Select<CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213><CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213><CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213><CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213><CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213><CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213><CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>Several weeks ago, the Interior Department indicatedto me that they will willingly conduct the studies that would have beenrequired by my amendment. The Department is also planning to spend somemoney this year to improve the condition of the wetlands. Futhermore, theDepartment's action intended to help the cui-ui will not actually haveany detrimental impact on the wetlands this year, because Nevada is alreadysuffering drought conditions. Under the circumstances, I no longer feelit is appropriate or necessary for me to keep a hold on the bill to reauthorizethe Endangered Species Act, <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>n<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>or need I pursue an amendment to the bill to requireInterior to do what they have already agreed to do.<CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>After consulting with the National Audubon Society,and a number of conservation groups based in Nevada, I have concluded thatthe one best way to protect these wetlands is for the Federal Governmentto acquire water rights from willing sellers for the benefit of the wetlands.Since a Federal law, the Endangered Species Act, has created the threatto the wetlands, it seems entirely appropriate that the Federal Governmentshould bear the cost of eliminating that threat.<CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>As the Senate begins the appropriations process,I will pursue the matter of purchasing water rights from willing sellersfor the benefit of the wetlands. I hope that I will be able to rely onthe assistance of the Environment Committee and the Indian Affairs Committeein this regard, so we can protect these fish and wildlife resources thatare important to Nevada, our Nation, and indeed the entire Western Hemisphere.<CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>Mr. President, I ask that an article from the NewYork Times of Tuesday, April 26, 1988, which discusses this tragic andbizarre conflict between the Endangered Species Act and the need to protectour fish and wildlife resources, be printed in the <CODE-213>1</CODE-213><T4><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>Record.<CODE-213>1</CODE-213></T4><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>The article follows:<CODE-213>1</CODE-213></ITAG>[S11MY8-1010]<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>{S5485}<CODE-213>1</CODE-213>The Dilemm<ITAG tagnum="74">The Dilemma: Save a Fish or a Wetland </ITAG>[S11MY8-1011]<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>{S5485}<CODE-213>1</CODE-213>(By Lindse<ITAG tagnum="71">(By Lindsey Gruson) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Fallon, Nev.<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>_<CODE-213>0</CODE-213></T4><CODE-213>5</CODE-213>A<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> festering water dispute here is forcing environmentaliststo choose between saving an endangered fish and preserving one of the country'smost vital rest stops for migrating shorebirds. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The dilemma is caused by Federal efforts to protect the qui-ui, thelast remaining genus of a family of suckerlike fish threatened with ext<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>in<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ction because of falling water levels in its soleknown habitat, Pyram<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>id<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> Lake, 60 miles northeast of Reno. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The Department of Int<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>er<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ior last week unveiled a plan to raise the levelof the lake to save the fish. But that would require reducing the trickleof life-sustaining water flowing into the wetlands of the Stillwater WildlifeManagement Area. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The Stillwater wetlands are the vestige of a prehistoric sea thatonce spread across north<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>we<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>stern Nevada and into California. As recently as25 years ago, Stillwater was a nutrit<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>i<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ous soup of algae and insects, aquatic weeds andfish. But now the wetlands are little more than naturally polluted poolspermeated by the stench of death. Barren salt flats bake where tanglesof bullrushes once thrived. Mass death of wildlife is almost as regularas the changing seasons. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The refuge, which in prehistoric times was under more than 500 feetof water, gained national notoriety early last year when millions of fishwashed aground, ringing 40 miles of shoreline with a four-foot-wide bandof rotting fish. Although the cause of the kill has not been pinpointed,pollution is suspected. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">State wildlife officials and numerous environmentalists say the Federalplan would be the death blow for the embattled wetlands. It is a winterhome of several endangered bird species, including p<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>er<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>egrine falcons and bald eagles, and one of the hemisphere'skey rest and feeding stops for birds migrating along the Pacific flyway.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">``We'll still have an area with water, but it will be little morethan a toxic waste dump,'' said Norman Saake, a waterfowl biologist withthe Nevada State Department of Wildlife, ``We've already reached the threshold;we've almost lost it. The question is, do we want the wetlands to exist?Do we want the Pacific flyway to exist?''</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Also involved in the dispute are local Indians whose culture dependson the qui-ui. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">An alter<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>na<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>tive to choosing between the fish and the wetlandshas been proposed: buying water rights from farmers who appear willingto sell.

That protected the wildlife's natural habitatby imposing stiff restrictions on most types of development and commercialexploitation.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">But too often lands were set aside without insuring access to thelifeblood of the arid West: scarce water. Since few of the region's protectedwetlands own water rights, recent increases in demand by farmers or citiesfor Western water are drying up wildlife habitats and concentrating waterbornepollution downstream.</ITAG>[S11MY8-1012]{S5485}almost all<ITAG tagnum="89">almost all gone</ITAG>[S11MY8-1013]{S5485}<ITAG tagnum="21">``It's like a steppingstone across a rapid,'' Dr. Myers said. ``Oneby one, the stones are being uprooted and removed.

Stillwater is not in much better shape, an 8,000-acre, fast-vanishingshadow of what was originally 33,000 acres of bogs and marshes, bullrushesand cattails.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Stillwater is fed by the runoff from upstream farms and as it shrinks,pollutants in the ru<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>n<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>off, including boron, selenium, arsenic and mercury,are concentrated. Now great blue herons that feed in the marsh fall deadout of the sky. And biologists find American white pelicans with grotesquedeformities, such as cinnamon-bun-shaped bills.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The problem grows out of the Newlands Project, the Bureau of Reclamation'sfirst irrigation project. The network of dams and canals, completed in1915, diverted water from the Truckee River, which flows from the SierraNevada through Lake Tahoe and into Pyramid Lake, to the rich but arid soilof the Lahontan Valley.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The level of the lake soon fell, stopping the spillover into WinnemuccaLake, an oasis for swirling clouds of waterfowl and dense schools of fish.By 1936, when Winnemucca Lake was declared a national wildlife refuge,it was little more than a sun-baked desert. The Government soon revokedits status as a refug<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>e<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Now the level of Pyramid Lake has fallen an estimated 80 feet, forminga barrier of shallow shoals across the mouth of the Truckee and blockingthe qui-ui from their spawning grounds 25 miles upstream.

Gjelde, Under Secretary of the Interior, would ineffect put Truckee water into a bank account and impose a sliding cap onwithdrawals. Fallon farmers could save or borrow from their allocationfrom one year to the next.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">``We're being forced into a Solomonic choice between an endangeredspecies and a wetland,'' said Cynthia Lenhart, a wildlife specialist forthe National Audubon Society. ``And that's no choice at all. The questionis, do public lands have inherent water rights or do they have to dependon the largess of upstream users?''</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The state and conservation groups want the Government to buy waterrights from area alfalfa farmers and cattle ranchers. That would guaranteea minimum water flow, flush pollutants and spur the regeneration of vegetation.But it would cost $50 million just for Stillwater and billions for otherthreatened wetlands.</ITAG>[S11MY8-1016]{S5485}that's a l<ITAG tagnum="89">that's a lot of money</ITAG>[S11MY8-1017]{S5485}<ITAG tagnum="21">``In this era of high deficits, that's a lot of money,'' Ms. Lenhartacknowledged. ``But this is a critical link in the flyway, the only gasstop for hundreds of miles. There's no other route for the birds. They'veused it for millenniums. The only thing that will help the refuge is buyingwater rights.''</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The loss of Stillwater would erect an impassable barrier to migratingbirds, which depend on the wetlands to rest, eat and gather strength, saidDr. J.P. Myers, the Audubon Society's senior vice president for scienceand sanctuaries, who estimated that 450,000 acres o<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>f<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> wetlands, much of it in the West, vanish each eyar.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Each year, Stillwater shelters at least 250,000 migrating shorebirds,more than 30 percent of the entire populations of some species. It is sovital to migrating fowl that an international conservation group, the WesternHemisphere Shorebird Reserve Network, recently named it one of the country'ssix most import shorebird preserves.</ITAG>[S11MY8-1018]{S5485}greater lo<ITAG tagnum="89">greater losses predicted</ITAG>[S11MY8-1019]{S5485}<ITAG tagnum="21">L<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>i<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ke the original proposal, the ultimate impact ofthe plan would be to give Pyramid Lake more water, raising its level sixfeet, and to give Fallon farmers less. That would reduce flows into theStillwater Management area and dry up about 18,000 acres, Mr. Gjelde said.But state officials predit a much greater loss of wetland acreage.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Mr. Gjelde said the Department of Interior would mitigate the lossof wetland acreage by spending $200,000 on a series of dikes to create400 acres of ``high-quality wetlands.''

Mr. President, I am pleased to join in enthusiastic support ofthe nomination of Edward M. Rowell as Ambassasor to Portugal. Recently, while leading a Senate delegation to visit NATO southern flankcountries, I had the opportunity to meet Ambassador Rowell in Lisbon. Hehas been there since early this year, serving with distinction as Ambassadorunder a recess appointment_an unusual procedure, but one justified in thisinstance by the sensitivity of our relations with the Portuguese at thispoint, and the long gap in filling this important post. Based on my own observations in Lisbon, it is clear that Ed Rowell is doingan outstanding job. He is representing American interests with the PortugueseGovernment with skill and sensitivity, at an important time in our bilateralrelations_with ongoing consultations on the future of our vital bases inLajes. I should also note that Ambassador Rowell is running a very ``tight ship''at his mission, and_judging by the enthusiasm of his staff_is providingreal leadership and good management. Ed Rowell's success in Lisbon comes as no surprise. He has an extensiveand impressive diplomatic background. He has been a member of the ForeignService for more than three decades, and has served ably at posts in Centraland South America; Europe; and at the State Department. And he is an expertin Iberian affairs, and a fluent speaker of Portuguese_facts made impressivelyclear in my own meetings with Portuguese officials in Lisbon. I endorse this nomination without reservation. I congratulate Ed Rowell,his wife<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>,<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> Lenora, and his two children.

For reasons whichremain unclear to this Senator, however, the administration earlier thisyear departed from its assurances to the Senate and Mr. Rowell was appointedjust 1 week_I emphasize, just 1 week_prior to the Senate reconvening onJanuary 25, 1988. Indeed, Mr. Rowell did not actually arrive in Portugaluntil January 23, 2 days before the Senate reconvened.<CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>Mr. President, Mr. Rowell would have been confirmedlong ago if the administration ha<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>d<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> followed the normal and proper procedure. The Committeeon Foreign Relations was eager to consider the nomination, and did so expeditiously.There was no urgency to send Mr. Rowell prior to consideration of his nominationby the committee and by the Senate. The post had been vacant for over 1year. The previous nominee for the post, Richard Viets, asked that hisname be <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>withdrawn.

In late December, 1987, Richard Viets asked that his name be withdrawnfrom consideration to be U.S. Ambassador to Portugal. Over one year hadlapsed since the post had been occupied. In the interim U.S. interestsin Portugal were suffering. Portuguese dismay about the vacancy had beenexpressed both by Portugal's President and the Prime Minister. In the aftermathof Mr. Viets' withdrawal, I was asked to become ambassador.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Portugal is an important NATO ally. We have vital interests there,including a military base key to our anti-submarine operations in the Atlanticand our re-supply operations in the Middle East. Our assistance levelshave declined steadily for three years. The sharp reduction in U.S. aid,combined with the pr<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>o<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>longed absence of an American Ambassador, had ledto rising frustration and anger at top levels of the Portuguese government.The Portuguese interpreted this absence, together with declining securityassistance, as evidence that the U.S. did not attach importance to therelationship and was taking Portugal for granted. Our ability to conductbusiness at senior levels in Lisbon was increasingly impaired. Severalimportant matters, including consultations concerning future use of ourextremely important military base in the Azores as well as high level visitsby Secretary Carlucci and Portuguese Prime Minister Cavaco Silva, werecoming to a head.
