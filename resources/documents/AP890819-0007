(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   They're nuts about white squirrels inMarionville. Just ask the folks at the White Squirrel FurnitureStore, the White Squirrel Car Wash or the White Squirrel Hollow Bedandamp; Breakfast.   And watch where you're driving: A 21-year-old city ordinanceimposes a $500 fine for deliberately injuring or killing one of therare albino squirrels. Motorists must yield right of way to them.   No one has ever been arrested for violating the law, but thatdoesn't mean it's taken lightly.   ``If I catch somebody killing a white squirrel, I will issue acitation,'' said Police Chief Jesse Merritt, who wears asquirrel-emblazoned shoulder patch on his uniform. ``It's no joke.''   Some people even go so far as to trap the albinos' gray cousinsand banish them from the small southwest Missouri town to give thewhite squirrels first crack at the nuts.   Marionville, home to 2,000 people and nearly half that many whitesquirrels, has a billboard welcoming visitors to the ``Home of theWhite Squirrel.''   Only one other community in the nation _ Olney, Ill. _ is knownto have a sizable concentration of the snow-white squirrels, butMarionville's colony is much larger, says James Smart, a localauthority and booster of the animal.   ``We've blown Olney off the map,'' he boasts. Olney has a measlyfew dozen squirrels, he figures.   Wildlife experts say finding any albino animal colony the size ofMarionville's is rare.   ``Normally you see an albino show up occasionally in a populationsuch as squirrels or birds or deer, but entire populations are notsomething you come across all that frequently,'' said EricKurzejeski, a state wildlife research biologist.   Signs of Marionville's affection for the white squirrel, whichmates and otherwise interacts normally with its gray cousin, areeverywhere.   The Lions Club sells white squirrel T-shirts and pins to raisemoney to buy redwood boxes that are placed in trees as homes for thesquirrels. More than 500 dens have been put up, and volunteers haveplanted hundreds of nut trees.   ``We've had orders for T-shirts from Kalamazoo, Mich., to LosAngeles, San Francisco, Memphis, Kentucky,'' says Smart, a Lionsmember. ``Marionville is a small town, but people who grew up hereand moved away still remember their roots and want to help the whitesquirrel.''   White squirrels first appeared in Marionville around 1860, Smartsays. According to local legend, a couple of the critters escapedfrom a traveling circus and began multiplying, or were the productof a weird experiment by a local scientist.   Smart became fascinated by white squirrels when one showed up onthe deck of his home about 12 years ago. He set out to increase thepopulation by trapping the more numerous gray squirrels in the woodsaround his home and releasing them several miles away to providemore room for the whites.   ``We trapped 110 gray squirrels in a year and a half,'' he said.``It was just amazing what the whites did then.''   Smart estimates that about three dozen albino squirrels live in30 den boxes and in trees on his heavily wooded property.   ``I have one picture at home with 17 white squirrels in it,'' hesaid.   Retirees Johnie and Ann Clark spend hours on their back porchwatching the white squirrels munch corn and walnuts placed at theirfeeders. The couple had no white squirrels until Smart transplantedsome there a few years ago.   ``They'll play just like a little kitten,'' Mrs. Clark said.``There will be five or six in the yard looking for something to eatand I'll say, `Don't leave, Johnie's bringing you something.' Iswear they can understand me.''   Diana Wise, who runs the White Squirrel Hollow Bed andamp; Breakfastwith her husband, Clint, says people come for miles to see theanimals.   ``A lot of people don't really believe we have white squirrelsbecause they stop at noon and don't see them,'' she said. ``The besttime to see them is 6:30 or 7 in the morning and around 7, 7:30 atnight when they're feeding. They don't like the heat and I think thelight hurts their pink eyes.''   Smart used to hunt gray squirrels (``Young squirrel, fried, withbiscuits and gravy _ you can't beat it''), but not anymore.   ``The squirrels are a hobby, a challenge for me now,'' he says.``I guess I'm paying back for all the hunting I used to do.''</TEXT></DOC>
