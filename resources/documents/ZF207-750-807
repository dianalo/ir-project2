(includes related article describing how an array works)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Naegele, Tobias.andM;</AUTHOR><TEXT><ABSTRACT>Focal plane arrays, tiny, highly-sensitive imaging systems thatprovide detailed pictures at night, in heavy smoke or throughclouds from orbit, are the objects of a massive development effortby government and industry because of their usefulness in militaryapplications.andP;  The arrays offer wider fields of view, increasedsensitivity and improved resolution over their predecessors, in asmaller package.andP;  The arrays are also based on passive sensingtechnology, which means that infrared detection does not emit asignal the enemy can use to aim return fire.andP;  Production of focalplane arrays has been limited, however, due to their exorbitantproduction costs.andP;  For example, a single 128-by-128 array can costmore than $60,000.andP;  The Pentagon and several defense electronicscompanies are financing a series of efforts aimed at reducingthese costs and to develop detectors for individual applications.andM;</ABSTRACT></TEXT><DESCRIPT>Topic:     Infrared TechnologyDetectorsArraysResearch and DevelopmentFinancingApplications.andO;Feature:   illustrationphotograph.andM;</DESCRIPT></DOC>
