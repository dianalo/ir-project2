The new recommendationsconsider total risk (to the whole body) instead of controlling (critical-organ)risk. Subsequent publications and explanatory statements most usefulfor providing clarification of the intent of the new recommendationshave not resolved practical problems encountered in attempting to applythem to either occupational or public exposures. Some of the problemsthat still exist in applying these recommendations for estimating dosesto members of the public include the following: allowance for age differenceswithin an exposed population group, definition of 50-y dose versus lifetime(70-y) dose, definition of negligible risk levels for individual andcollective doses, and derivation of appropriate concentration guidelines.The United States is in the process of adopting the revised recommendationsof the ICRP. In addition to adopting versions of the primary radiationprotection standards, both the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission andthe U.S. Department of Energy have developed draft secondary standardsthat are similar to the Derived Air Concentration values given by theICRP. This paper presents a brief history of the development of theserevised secondary standards, discusses their technical bases, providesa comparison of them, and discusses their limitations and potential misapplication.</TEXT></DOC>
