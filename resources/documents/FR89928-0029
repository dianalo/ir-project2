The purpose of that proceeding was ``* * * toassess generically the degree of assurance now available that radioactivewaste can be safely disposed of, to determine when such disposal or offsitestorage will be available and to determine whether radioactive waste canbe safely stored onsite past the expiration of existing facility licensesuntil offsite disposal or storage is available.'' (49 FR 34658). The purposeof this notice is to present for public comment the proposed findings ofa Commission review of that Decision. The Commission noted in 1984 that its Waste Confidence Decision was unavoidablyin the nature of a prediction, and committed to review its conclusions``* * * should significant and pertinent unexpected events occur or atleast every five years until a repository is available.''The Commission has reviewed its five findings and the rationale for themin light of developments since 1984. This proposed revised waste ConfidenceDecision supplements those 1984 findings and the environmental analysissupporting them. The Commission proposes that the second and fourth findingsin the Waste Confidence Decision be revised as follows:Finding 2: The Commission finds reasonable assurance that at least onemined geologic repository will be available within the first quarter ofthe twenty-first century, and that sufficient repository capacity willbe available within 30 years beyond the lincensed life for operation ofany reactor to dispose of the commercial high-level radioactive waste andspent fuel originating in such reactor and generated up to that time.Finding 4: The Commission finds reasonable assurance that, if necessary,spent fuel generated in any reactor can be stored safely and without significantenvironmental impacts for at least 30 years beyond the licensed life foroperation (which may include the term of a revised license) of that reactorat its spent fuel storage basin, or at either onsite or offsite independentspent fuel storage installations.The Commission proposes to reaffirm the remaining findings. Each finding,any proposed revisions, and the reasons for revising or reaffirming themare set forth in the body of the review below.The Commission also issued two companion rulemaking amendments at the timeit issued the 1984 Waste Confidence Decision. The Commission's reactorlicensing rule, 10 CFR part 50, was amended to require each licensed reactoroperator to submit, no later than five years before expiration of the operatinglicense, plans for managing spent fuel at the reactor site until the spentfuel is transferred to the Department of Energy (DOE) for disposal underthe Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 (NWPA). 10 CFR part 51, the rule definingNRC's responsibilities under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA),was amended to provide that, in connection with the issuance or amendmentof a reactor operating license or initial license for an independent spentfuel storage installation, no discussion of any environmental impact ofspent fuel storage is required for the period following expiration of thelicense or amendment applied for.In keeping with the proposed revised Findings 2 and 4, the Commission isproviding elsewhere in this issue of the <T4>Federal Register</T4> proposed conforming amendments to its 10 CFRpart 51 rule providing procedures of considering in licensing proceedingsthe environmental effects of extended onsite storage of spent fuel.Finally, the Commission proposes to extend the cycle of its Waste Confidencereviews from every five years to every ten until a repository becomes available.In its 1984 Decision, the Commisson said that because its conclusions were``* * * unavoidably in the nature of a prediction,'' it would review them``* * * should significant and unexpected events occur, or at least everyfive years until a repository * * * is available.'' As noted below, theCommission now believes that predictions of repository availability arebest expressed in terms of decades rather than years. To specify a yearfor the expected availability of a repository decades hence would misleadinglyimply a degree of precision now unattainable. Accordingly, the Commissionproposes to change its original commitment in order to review its WasteConfidence Decision at least every ten years. This would not, however,disturb the Commission's original commitment to review its Decision wheneversignificant and pertinent unexpected events occur.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATES: </T2>The comment period expires December 27, 1989.

The NRDC also requested that NRCnot grant pending or furture requests for operating licenses until thepetitioned finding of safety was made.On June 27, 1977, NRC denied the NRDC petition. The Commission said thatin issuing operating licenses, NRC must have assurance that wastes canbe safely handled and stored as they are generated. It also said that itis not necessary for permanent disposal to be available if NRC could beconfident that permanent disposal could be accomplished when necessary.NRC added that Congress was aware of the relationship between nuclear reactoroperations and the radioactive waste disposal problem, and that NRC wouldnot refrain from issuing reactor operating licenses until the disposalproblem was resolved. The Commission also stated that it ``* * * wouldnot continue to license reactors if it did not have reasonable confidencethat the wastes can and will in due course be disposed of safely.''Also in November 1976, two utility companies requested amendments to theiroperating licenses to permit expansion in the capacity of this spent nuclearfuel storage pools: Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corporation for the VermontYankee plant; and Northern States Power Company for its Prairie Islandfacility. In both cases, the utilities planned to increase storage capacitythrough closer spacing of spent fuel assemblies in existing spent fuelpools. The New England Coalition on Nuclear Power and the Minnesota PollutionControl Agency intervened. The NRC staff evaluated the requests and foundthat the modifications would not endanger public health and safety. Thestaff did not consider any potential environmental effects of storage ofspent fuel at the reactors beyond the dates of expiration of their operatinglicenses. NRC's Atomic Safety and Licensing Board Panel (ASLBP) adoptedthe staff's safety and environmental findings and approved the licenseamendments for the two plants. It too did not consider the effects of at-reactorstorage beyond the expiration of the facility operating license.The Board's decision was appealed to the Atomic Safety and Licensing AppealBoard (ASLAB). The ASLAB affirmed the Licensing Board's decision, citingthe Commission's ``* * * reasonable confidence that wastes can and willin due course be disposed of safely * * *'' in the Commission's denialof the NRDC petition. The decision of the ASLAB was appealed to the U.S.Circuit Court of Appeals.On May 23, 1979 the Court declined to stay or vacate the license amendments,but remanded to NRC the question of ``* * * whether there is reasonableassurance that an offsite storage solution will be available by the years2007-2009, the expiration of the plants' operating licenses, and if not,whether there is reasonable assurance that the fuel can be safely storedat the reactor sites beyond those dates.'' In its decision to remand toNRC, for consideration in either a generic rulemaking or an adjudicatoryproceeding, the Court observed that the issues of storage and disposalof nuclear waste were being considered by the Commission in an ongoinggeneric proceeding known as the ``S-3 Proceeding'' on the environmentalimpacts of uranium fuel cycle activities to support the operation of alight water reactor, and that it was appropriate to remand in light ofa pending decision on that proceeding and analysis.On October 18, 1979, NRC announced that it was initiating a rulemakingproceeding in response to the Appeals Court remand and as a continuationof the NRDC proceeding. Specifically, the purpose of the proceeding wasfor the Commission ``* * * to reassess its degree of confidence that radioactivewastes produced by nuclear facilities will be safely disposed of, to determinewhen any such disposal will be available, and whether such wastes can besafely stored until they are disposed of.''The Commission recognized that the scope of this proceeding would be broaderthan the Court's instruction, which required the Commission to addressonly storage-related questions. The Commission believed, however, thatthe primary public concern was the safety of waste disposal rather thanthe availability of an off-site solution to the storage problem. The Commissionalso committed itself to reassess its basis for confidence that methodsof safe permanent disposal for high-level waste would be available whenneeded. Thus, the Commission chose as a matter of policy not to confineitself exclusively to the narrower issues in the court remand.In the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, the Commission also stated that ifthe proceeding led to a finding that safe off-site storage or disposalwould be available before expiration of facility operating licenses, NRCwould promulgate a rule providing that the impact of onsite storage ofspent fuel after expiration of facility operating licenses need not beconsidered in individual licensing proceedings.The Waste Confidence Decision was issued on August 31, 1984 (49 FR 34658).In the Decision, the Commission made five findings. It found reasonableassurance that:(1) Safe disposal of high-level radioactive waste and spent fuel in a minedgeologic repository is technically feasible.(2) One or more mined geologic repositories for commercial high-level radioactivewaste and spent fuel will be available by the years 2007-2009, and sufficientrepository capacity will be available within 30 years beyond expirationof any reactor operating license to dispose of existing commercial high-levelradioactive waste and spent fuel originating in such reactor and generatedup to that time.(3) High-level radioactive waste and spent fuel will be managed in a safemanner until sufficient repository capacity is available to assure thesafe disposal of all high-level radioactive waste and spent fuel.(4) If necessary, spent fuel generated in any reactor can be stored safelyand without significant environmental impacts for at least 30 years beyondthe expiration of that reactor's operating license at that reactor's spentfuel storage basin, or at either onsite or offsite independent spent fuelstorage installations.(5) Safe independent onsite or offsite spent fuel storage will be madeavailable if such storage capacity is needed.On the day the Decision was issued, the Commission also promulgated tworulemaking amendments: (1) An amendment to 10 CFR part 50, which requiredthat no later than five years before expiration of reactor operating licenses,the licensee must provide NRC with a written plan for management of spentfuel onsite, until title for the spent fuel is transferred to the DOE;and (2) an amendment to 10 CFR part 51 which provided that environmentalconsequences of spent fuel storage after expiration of facility licensesneed not be addressed in connection with issuance of or amendment to areactor operating license.In issuing the part 51 amendment, the Commission stated that although ithad reasonable assurance that one or more repositories would be availableby 2007-2009, it was possible that some spent fuel would have to be storedbeyond those dates. The part 51 amendment was based on the Commission'sfinding in the Waste Confidence Proceeding that it had reasonable assurancethat no significant environmental impacts will result from storage of spentfuel for at least 30 years beyond expiration of reactor operating licenses.Enactment of the NWPA contributed significantly to the basis for the Commission's1984 Decision and companion rulemakings. The Act established a fundingsource and process with milestones and schedules for, among other things,the development of a monitored retrievable storage (MRS) facility and tworepositories, one by early 1998 and a second, if authorized by Congress,at a later date, initially planned by DOE for 2006. For each repository,the Act required DOE to conduct <T3>in-situ</T3> investigations of three sites and recommend one from amongthem to the President and Congress for repository development. The NWPAalso required DOE to recommend, from among alternative sites and designs,a site and design for an MRS for spent fuel and high-level waste managementbefore disposal. The Commission's licensing and regulatory authority overboth storage and disposal facilities was preserved by the Act.In the four years after enactment of the NWPA, DOE met a number of theAct's early program requirements, but also encountered significant difficulties.It published a final Mission Plan for the overall NWPA program, and followedwith a Project Decision Schedule for DOE and other Federal agency actions.It promulgated, with Commission concurrence, a set of guidelines for repositorysiting and development. It published draft and final environmental assessmentsfor nine candidate repository sites, and recommended three for characterization.It completed and submitted to Congress an environmental assessment, a programplan, and a proposal with a site and design for an MRS. All these actionsfollowed extensive interactions with interested Federal agencies, State,Indian tribal, and local governments, and other organizations. In the courseof these activities, however, DOE also slipped its schedule for operationof the first repository by five years, indefinitely postponed efforts towarda second repository, and had to halt further MRS siting and developmentactivities pending Congressional authorization.In December, 1987, Congress enacted the Nuclear Waste Policy AmendmentsAct (NWPAA). The NWPAA redirected the high-level waste program by suspendingsite characterization activities for the first repository at sites otherthan the Yucca Mountain site, and by suspending all site-specific activitieswith respect to a second repository. The Amendments Act also authorizedand set schedule and capacity limits on the MRS. The purpose of these limitations,according to sponsors of the legislation, was to assure that an MRS wouldnot become a substitute for a geologic repository.Consistent with its commitment to revisit its Waste Confidence conclusionsat least every five years, the Commission has undertaken the current reviewto assess the effect of these and other developments since 1984 on thebasis for each of its five findings. In this document, the Commission supplementsthe basis for its earlier findings and the environmental analysis of the1984 Decision. The Commission proposes to amend its second finding, concerningthe timing of initial availability and sufficient capacity of a repository,and its fourth finding, concerning the duration of safe spent fuel storage.These proposed revisions are based on the following considerations:(1) The five-year slippage, from 1998 to 2003, in the DOE schedule forrepository availability;(2) The additional slip of at least 18 months since January 1987 in theDOE schedule for the next step in the repository program, the excavationof the exploratory shaft;(3) The need to continue accounting for the possibility that the YuccaMountain site might be found unsuitable and that DOE would have to initiateefforts to identify and characterize another site for the first repository;(4) The statutory suspension of site-specific activities for the secondrepository;(5) DOE's estimate that site screening for a second repository should startabout 25 years before the start of waste acceptance; and(6) Increased confidence in the safety of extended spent fuel storage,either at the reactor or at independent spent fuel storage installations.The Commission is also proposing elsewhere in this issue of the <T4>Federal Register</T4> that 10 CFR andSection; 51.23(a) be amended toconfirm with the proposed revisions to Findings 2 and 4.<ITAG tagnum="84">Organization and Table of Contents</ITAG>In conducting this review, the Commission has addressed, for each of its1984 Findings, two categories of issues. The first category consists ofthe issues the Commission considered in making each Finding at the timeof the initial Waste Confidence Decision. For these issues, the Commissionis interested in whether its conclusions, or the Finding these conclusionssupport, should be changed to address new or foreseeable developments thathave arisen since the first Waste Confidence Decision. The second categoryof issues consists of those the Commission believes should be added tothe 1984 issues in light of subsequent developments. (To enable the readerto follow more easily, the lengthy discussions of Findings 1 and 2 havebeen organized to address each original and new issue under subheadings.)The Commission seeks comment on whether it has identified all the issuesrelevant to its proposed findings, and on whether its analyses of theseissues supports the conclusions and findings proposed.<ITAG tagnum="73">Table of Contents</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="71">I.

Issues Considered in Commission's 1984 Decision on Finding 1<ITAG tagnum="81">1.A.1. The Identification of Acceptable Sites</ITAG>Under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 (NWPA), the Department of Energy(DOE) had responsibility for identifying candidate sites for a geologicrepository and for repository development. The first requirement leadingto recommendation of candidate sites was formal notification of Stateswith one or more potentially acceptable sites for a repository within 90days of enactment of the NWPA. In February 1983, the DOE identified ninepotentially acceptable sites for the first repository. Four of the siteswere in bedded-salt formations, three were in salt domes, one in volcanictuff, and one in basalt.The NWPA required that each site nomination be accompanied by an environmentalassessment (EA). In December 1984, DOE published Draft EAs (DEAs) for eachof the nine sites identified as potentially acceptable and proposed thefollowing sites for nomination: The reference repository location at Hanford,WA; Yucca Mountain, NV; Deaf Smith County, TX; Davis, Canyon, UT; and RichtonDome, MS. In May 1986, DOE released Final EAs (FEAs) for the five sitesnominated. At that time, DOE recommended that the Yucca Mountain, Hanford,and Deaf Smith County sites undergo site characterization. The Presidentapproved the recommendation.The NRC staff provided extensive comments on both the DEAs and the FEAs.NRC concerns on the FEAs related primarily to DOE's failure to recognizeuncertainty inherent in the existing limited data bases for the recommendedsites, and the tendency of DOE to present overly favorable or optimisticconclusions. The primary intent of the comments was to assist DOE in preparinghigh-quality Site Characterization Plans (SCPs) for each site, as requiredunder the NWPA, before excavation of exploratory shafts. NRC concerns canonly be addressed adequately through the site characterization process,because one of the purposes of this process is to develop the data to evaluatethe significance of concerns relative to site suitability.NRC did not identify any fundamental technical flaw or disqualifying factorwhich it believed would render any of the sites unsuitable for characterization.Further, NRC did not take a position on the ranking of the sites in orderof preference, because this could be viewed as a prejudgment of licensingissues. NRC was not aware of any reason that would indicate that any ofthe candidate sites was unlicenseable. Nor has NRC made any such findingto date with respect to any site identified as potentially acceptable.In March 1987, Congress began drafting legislation to amend the repositoryprogram. NRC provided comments on a number of these draft amendments. InDecember 1987, the NWPAA was enacted. In a major departure from the initialintent of the NWPA, the new law required that DOE suspend site characterizationactivities at sites other than the Yucca Mountain site. This decision wasnot based on a technical evaluation of the three recommended sites or aconclusion that the Hanford and Deaf Smith sites were not technically acceptable.According to sponsors of the legislation, the principal purpose of therequirement to suspend characterization at these sites was to reduce costs.In effect, the NWPAA directed DOE to characterize candidate sites sequentially,if necessary, rather than simultaneously. If DOE determines at any timethat the Yucca Mountain site is unsuitable, DOE is to terminate all sitecharacterization activities and report to Congress its recommendationsfor further actions.The NRC staff has identified numerous issues regarding the Yucca Mountainsite that may have a bearing on the licenseability of that site. Theseissues will have to be resolved during site characterization. An exampleof a site issue that may bear on the question of suitability is tectonicactivity, the folding or faulting of the earth's crust. In the 1984 WasteConfidence Decision, NRC noted that ``* * * the potential sites being investigatedby DOE are in regions of relative tectonic stability.'' The authority forthis statement came from the Position Statement of the U.S. GeologicalSurvey (USGS). NRC has raised concerns regarding tectonic activity at theYucca Mountain site in the comments on the draft and final EAs, and inthe draft and final Point Papers on the Consultation Draft Site CharacterizationPlan. If it appears during site characterization that the Yucca Mountainsite will be unable to meet NRC requirements regarding isolation of waste,DOE will have to suspend characterization at that site and report to Congress.DOE's program of site screening in different geologic media was consistentwith section 112(a) of the NWPA, which required that DOE recommend sitesin different geologic media to the extent practicable. This strategy wasto ensure that if any one site were found unsuitable for reasons that wouldrender other sites in the same geologic medium unacceptable, alternatesites in different host rock types would be available. NRC referred tothis policy in its 1984 Waste Confidence Decision, when it said, in supportof its argument on technical feasibility, that ``* * * DOE's program isproviding information on site characteristics at a sufficiently large numberand variety of sites and geologic media to support the expectation thatone or more technically acceptable sites will be identified.NRC recognizes that simultaneous site characterization is not necessaryto identify a repository site that would meet NRC's technical criteriafor isolating wastes. Sequential site characterization does not necessarilypreclude or hinder identification of an acceptable site for a repository.NRC did express concern to Congress, on several occasions during deliberationsover the proposed legislation, that sequential site characterization coulddelay considerably the schedule for opening a repository if the site undergoingcharacterization were found to be unlicenseable. NRC also indicated thatthis potential for delay would have to be considered by NRC in reevaluatingthe findings in its Waste Confidence Decision. The impact of this redirectionof the high-level waste program on the Commission's Waste Confidence findingsis not on the ability to identify technically acceptable sites, but onthe timing of availability of technically acceptable sites. Because characterizationof multiple sites appears to be more directly related to the timing ofrepository availability than to the feasibility of geologic disposal, considerationof the above statement in light of the NWPAA program redirection will bediscussed under Finding 2.Another question bearing on whether technically acceptable sites can befound is whether compliance with Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)environmental standards for disposal of spent fuel and high-level wastecan be demonstrated. These standards, originally promulgated in final formin September 1985, were vacated in July 1987, by the U.S. Court of Appeals,and remanded to EPA for further consideration (see <T3>NRDC </T3>v. <T3>EPA, </T3>824 F. 2d 1258). As originally promulgated, the standardsset limits on releases of radioactive materials from the site into theaccessible environment over a 10,000-year period following disposal. Theyalso required that there be less than one chance in ten that the releaselimits will be exceeded in 10,000 years, and less than one chance in 1,000that releases will exceed ten times the limits over 10,000 years.In past comments on draft and proposed EPA standards, and in related NRCrulemaking efforts, NRC has expressed concern that probabilistic analysesshould not be exclusively relied on to demonstrate compliance with EPArelease limits. NRC's comments said in part that ``* * * [t]he numericalprobabilities in [the standards] would require a degree of precision whichis unlikely to be achievable in evaluating a real waste disposal system.''The comments went on to explain that ``* * * identification of the relevantprocesses and events affecting a particular site will require considerablejudgment and will not be amenable to accurate quantification, by statisticalanalysis, of their probability of occurrence.'' NRC believed then, andcontinues to believe, that it must make qualitative judgments about thedata and methodologies on which the numerical probabilities were based.In response to NRC concerns, EPA incorporated language into its 1985 standardsthat appeared to allow flexibility to combine qualitative judgments withnumerical probability estimates in a way that might have made implementationof the EPA standards practicable. The text of those standards recognizedthat ``proof of the future performance of a disposal system is not to behad in the ordinary sense of the word'' with the substantial uncertaintiesand very long performance period involved. The 1985 standards emphasizedthat a ``reasonable expectation''_rather than absolute proof_is to be thetest of compliance. ``What is required,'' the text of the standards said,``is a reasonable expectation, on the basis of the record * * *, that compliance* * * will be achieved.'' In an additional attempt to provide flexibilityfor implementation of the standards, EPA also provided that numerical analysesof releases from a repository were to be incorporated into an overall probabilitydistribution only ``to the extent practicable.'' This phrase appeared toallow some discretion for NRC to incorporate qualitative considerationsinto its license decision-making, rather than having to rely solely onnumerical projections of repository performance. On the strength of theseand other EPA assurances, the Commission did not object when the finalstandards were published in 1985.Pursuant to the remand by the Federal court in 1987, EPA is currently revisingits standards for disposal of spent fuel and high-level waste. The court'sdecision directed that the remand focus on the ground water and individualprotection requirements of the standards. Although the EPA standards arestill undergoing development at this time, the Commission does not currentlysee a sufficient basis to withdraw its confidence in the feasibility ofevaluating compliance with such standards. NRC staff will closely monitorthe development of repromulgated standards to assure that EPA methodologiesfor demonstrating compliance with them can be applied by NRC to evaluateDOE's demonstration of compliance.In sum, considering both past and current programs for characterizing sites,the Commission concludes that technically acceptable sites for a repositorycan be found. The Commission is confident that, given adequate time andresources, such sites can be identified, evaluated, and accepted or rejectedon their merits, even if no more than one site is undergoing site characterization.This judgment does not rest on the acceptability of the Yucca Mountainsite or any one future candidate site.<ITAG tagnum="81">1.A.2. The Development of Effective Waste Packages</ITAG>1.A.2.a. <T3>Considerations in developing waste packages.</T3> The NWPA requiredNRC to promulgate technical requirements and criteria to be applied inlicensing a repository for high-level radioactive waste. Under section121 of the Act, these technical criteria must provide for use of a systemof multiple barriers in the design of the repository and such restrictionson the retrievability of waste as NRC deems appropriate. The system ofmultiple barriers includes both engineered and natural barriers.The waste package is the first engineered barrier in the system of multiplebarriers to radionuclide escape. The waste package is defined as the ``wasteform and any containers, shielding, packing and other absorbent materialsimmediately surrounding an individual waste container.'' Before sinkingan exploratory shaft for site characterization, DOE is required to preparean SCP including a description of the waste form or packaging proposedfor use at the repository, and an explanation of the relationship betweensuch waste form or packaging and the geologic medium of the site.The multiple barrier approach to radioactive waste isolation in a geologicrepository is implemented in NRC requirements by a number of performanceobjectives and by detailed siting and design criteria. The NRC performanceobjective for the waste package requires substantially complete containmentfor a period of not less than 300 years nor more than 1,000 years afterpermanent closure of the repository. The technical design criteria forthe waste package require that interaction of the waste package with theenvironment not compromise performance of the package, the undergroundfacility, or the geologic setting. Therefore, the waste package designmust take into account the complex site-specific interactions between hostrock, waste package, and ground water that will affect waste package andoverall repository performance.Under the NWPAA, DOE was required to suspend site characterization activitiesat sites other than the Yucca Mountain, NV site. Consequently, DOE hasnarrowed the range of waste package designs to a design tailored for unsaturatedtuff at the Yucca Mountain site. This aspect of the high-level waste programredirection may facilitate and expedite the waste package design processinsofar as it enables DOE to concentrate its efforts on developing a singledesign for a single site instead of three designs for sites in bedded salt,basalt, and unsaturated tuff.Currently, DOE is evaluating uncertainties in waste package design relatedto waste form, container type, and environment. The current conceptualdesign for the waste package is based on several assumptions. the wasteform is presumed to be ten-year-old spent fuel or high-level waste in theform of borosilicate glass in stainless-steel canisters. (In addition tospent fuel and high-level waste, the waste form may include greater-than-ClassC (GTCC) low-level waste. This waste is not routinely acceptable for near-surfacedisposal under NRC regulations for disposal of low-level wastes, but isacceptable for disposal in a repository licensed for disposal of spentfuel and high-level wastes. This waste might include such materials assealed sources and activated metals from the decommissioning of reactorsand production facilities.)Six materials are being considered for fabrication of containers, includingaustenitic steel (316L), nickel-based alloys (Alloy 825), pure copper (CDA102), copper-based alloys (aluminum-bronze, CDA-613, and 70-30 Cu-Ni, CDA-715),and a container with a metal outer shell and ceramic liner. The referencecontainer for the spent fuel and high-level waste is a 1.0-cm thick cylinderto be made of American Iron and Steel Institute (AISI) 304L stainless steel.This will be DOE's benchmark material, against which other materials areto be compared. DOE currently intends for spent fuel containers to be filledwith an inert gas, such as argon, before being welded closed.The reference repository location is in the unsaturated tuff of the TopopahSpring Formation underlyign Yucca Mountain. According to DOE, little free-flowingwater is thought to be present there to contribute to corrosion of thewaste containers, although the degree of saturation in this tuff is estimatedto be 65andplusmin;19 percent of the available void space in the rock. DOEhas acknowledged, however, that the greatest uncertainties in assessingwaste package performance at Yucca Mountain stem from difficulty in characterizingand modeling the coupled geochemical-hydrologic processes that representthe interactions between the host rock, waste package, and ground water.The final waste package design will depend on the results of site characterizationand laboratory testing to reduce uncertainty in predicting these interactionsin the reference repository horizon. The final design will also be shapedby research in understanding the degradation of candidate container materials,and the characteristics of the likely reference waste forms.Regarding the state of technology for developing long-lived waste packagecontainers, the Swedish Nuclear Fuel and Waste Management Company (SKB),the organization responsible for radioactive waste disposal in Sweden,has described a container for spent fuel rods that consists of a 0.1-mthick copper canister surrounded by a bentonite overpack. The design callsfor pouring copper powder into the void spaces in the canisters, compactingthe powder using hot-isostatic pressing with an inert gas, and sealingthe canisters. SKB estimates that the copper canister waste package hasa million-year lifetime. (See also 1.B.3. below.)As noted in NRC's Final Point Papers on the Consultation Draft Site CharacterizationPlan, the Commission does not expect absolute proof that 100 percent ofthe waste packages will have 100 percent containment for 300 to 1,000 years.Since that time, the NRC staff has completed its review of the December1988 Site Characterization Plan for Yucca Mountain. Although the Commissioncontinues to have concerns about DOE's waste package program, nothing hasoccurred to diminish the Commission's confidence that as long as DOE establishesconservative objectives to guide a testing and design program, in tuffor in other geologic media if necessary, it is technically feasible todevelop a waste package that meets the performance objective for substantiallycomplete containment.1.A.2.b. <T3>Effect of reprocessing on waste form and waste package.</T3> The Draft1988 Mission Plan Amendment estimates that a total of about 77,800 metrictons of heavy metal (MTHM) of spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactivewaste will be available for disposal by the year 2020. (This estimate isbased on a ``no new orders'' assumption for commercial nuclear reactorsand a 40-year reactor lifetime.) Of this 77,800 MTHM, about 9,400 MTHMwill consist of reprocessed defense waste and a small amount of commercialreprocessed waste from the West Valley Demonstration Project. The decisionto locate the defense high-level waste in the repository for wastes fromcommercial power reactors resulted from the requirement in Section 8 ofthe NWPA that the President evaluate the possibility of developing a defense-waste-onlyrepository. In February 1985, DOE submitted a report to the President recommendinga combined commercial and defense repository. In April 1985, the Presidentagreed that no basis appeared to exist for a defense-only repository anddirected DOE to dispose of defense waste in the commercial repository.About 8,750 MTHM of reprocessed high-level waste from defense facilitiesat Savannah River, SC, Hanford, WA, and Idaho Falls, ID will be availableby 2020 for disposal in the repository, according to the Draft 1988 MissionPlan Amendment. This waste will likely be solidified into a borosilicateglass matrix. About 640 MTHM of reprocessed high-level waste will comefrom the West Valley Demonstration Project, a facility for wastes fromdiscontinued commercial reprocessing of spent fuel at that site. This reprocessedwaste also will be solidified, probably in a borosilicate glass waste form.Waste-form testing for the Yucca Mountain site is focusing on both spentfuel and reprocessed high-level waste. The performance of the waste formin providing the first barrier to radionuclide migration is being evaluatedon the basis of the physical and chemical environment of the waste formafter disposal, the performance of the waste container, and the emplacementconfiguration.A major limitation on glass waste-form testing is that the actual wasteglasses to be disposed of are not available, and their exact compositionwill not be established until after further testing. Reference waste-glasscompositions are being used for studies on the effect of variation in glasscomposition on performance. (These glass compositions are designed by SavannahRiver Laboratory (SRL) for defense high-level waste, and by Pacific NorthwestLaboratory (PNL) for the commercial high-level wastes to be vitrified underthe West Valley Demonstration Project Act.) The reference compositionswill be revised when better analyses of the composition of the wastes atSRL and West Valley are available. The test program will seek to establishupper bounds on leaching of important radionuclides, and the extent towhich glass fracturing increases leach rate. Other factors influencingleach rate are temperature, pH of the leaching solution, formation of solidlayers on the surface of the waste glass, irradiation, water volume, andchemistry.It is possible that renewed reprocessing of spent fuel from nuclear powerreactors may result in a greater proportion of reprocessed waste to spentfuel than is currently anticipated. Although such a departure from thecurrent plan to dispose of mostly unreprocessed spent fuel in the repositorydoes not appear likely at this time, the Commission believes it is importantto recognize the possibility that this situation could change.The possibility of disposal of reprocessed waste as an alternative wasteform to spent fuel assemblies was recognized by the Commission in the 1984Waste Confidence Decision. The Commission noted that the disposal of wastefrom reprocessing had been studied for a longer time than the disposalof spent fuel, and that the possibility of reprocessing does not alterthe technical feasibility of developing a suitable waste package. The Commissionwent on to say that there is evidence that the disposal of reprocessedhigh-level waste may pose fewer technical challenges than the disposalof spent fuel. As long as DOE uses conservative assumptions and test conditionsfor evaluating the performance of different waste forms against NRC licensingrequirements, the Commission has no basis to change its finding that thereis reasonable assurance that reprocessing does not reduce confidence inthe technical feasibility of designing and building a waste package thatwill meet NRC licensing requirements in a variety of geologic media.<ITAG tagnum="81">1.A.3. The Development of Effective Engineered Barriers for IsolatingWastes From the Biosphere  </ITAG>1.A.3.a. Backfill materials. At the time of the 1984 Waste Confidence Decision,DOE was developing conceptual designs for backfill in several geologicmedia. Most candidate sites at that time were in saturated rock, and theconceptual designs included backfilling or packing around waste containersto prevent or delay ground water flow which could enhance corrosion andradionuclide transport near the waste containers. The conceptual designfor the engineered barrier system at the Yucca Mountain site has differentparameters because the site is unsaturated; instead of backfill or packingaround the waste container, there is to be an air gap between sides ofthe waste canister and the host rock.  Backfill material around the container is not required under NRC regulationsfor the waste package. NRC regulations require that ``* * * containmentof high-level waste within the waste packages [which includes the container]will be substantially complete for a period to be determined by the Commission* * * provided, that such period shall not be less than 300 years nor morethan 1000 years after permanent closure of the repository'' (10 CFR 60.113(a)(1)(ii)(B)),and that the entire engineered barrier system meet the release rate performanceobjective of 1 part in 100,000 per year.  Backfill is also a component of the borehole, shaft, and ramp seals, whichare not part of the engineered barrier system or the underground facility.Boreholes, shafts, and ramps must be sealed when the repository is permanentlyclosed. This aspect of backfilling is discussed below under ``Developmentof sealants.'' Backfill may also include crushed rock used to fill openingssuch as drifts in the underground facility. At the Yucca Mountain candidatesite, DOE currently plans to fill openings in the underground facilityat closure of the repository. Backfilling is not planned before repositoryclosure because it is not needed for structural support for the openings,and it would make waste retrieval more difficult. At closure of the facility,however, openings will be backfilled with coarse tuff excavated for thefacility. In the conceptual design provided in the SCP, the selection ofcoarse tuff as backfill material is based on numerical simulations performedby DOE which suggest that coarse tuff would be a more effective barrierto capillary flow in the backfill matrix than fine materials.  DOE's design for the engineered barrier system submitted with the licenseapplication will have to contain information sufficient for NRC to reacha favorable conclusion regarding the overall system performance objective.Backfill or packing around waste containers is not required by NRC regulationsif DOE can demonstrate that applicable performance objectives can be metwithout it. If, on the basis of testing and experiments during site characterization,DOE decided that backfill would enhance engineered barrier system performance,the design would have to reflect this conclusion. DOE has already conductedresearch on a wide variety of candidate materials for backfill around wastepackages in a variety of geologic media. The Commission continues to haveconfidence that backfill or packing materials can be developed as neededfor the underground facility and waste package to meet applicable NRC licensingcriteria and performance objectives.  1.A.3.b. <T3>Borehole and shaft seals. </T3>The engineered barrier system describedabove is limited to the waste package and the underground facility as definedin 10 CFR part 60. The undergound facility refers to the underground structure,including openings and backfill materials, but excluding shafts, boreholes,and their seals. Containment and release-rate requirements are specifiedfor the engineered barrier system, but not for the borehole and shaft seals.Seals are covered under 10 CFR 60.112, the overall post-closure systemperformance objective for the repository. Among other things, this provisionrequires that shafts, boreholes and their seals be designed to assure thatrelease of radioactive materials to the accessible environment followingpermanent closure conform to EPA's generally applicable standards for radioactivity.Although the criteria for seals given in 10 CFR part 60 do not specificallymention seals in ramps and the underground facility, it is reasonable toconsider them together with borehole and shaft sealants, because the sealsand drainage design in ramps and the underground facility could also affectthe overall system performance of the geologic repository.  Construction of the exploratory shaft facility (ESF) will be the firstmajor site characterization activity. The ESF will consist of two verticalshafts, one for testing and the other for support, and underground excavationsfor at-depth testing. The repository surface facilities will be connectedto the underground facility by two additional shafts (a men-and-materialsshaft and the emplacement area exhaust shaft) and two ramps, a waste rampfor bringing radioactive waste and spent fuel into the repository, anda tuff ramp for removing rock from the underground facility to a tuff pile.In addition to these shafts and ramps, there will be exploratory boreholesfor obtaining samples of rock, water, and gases in strata at varying depths.Exploratory boreholes have the potential to provide information on hydrologicproperties of the Yucca Mountain site, with emphasis on movement of waterin unsaturated tuff. Other properties which will be studied using exploratoryboreholes are lithologic, structural, mechanical, and thermal propertiesof the host rock.  When the repository is decommissioned, NRC expects that most, if not all,shafts, ramps, and boreholes will probably have to be sealed to reducethe possibility that they could provide preferential pathways for radionuclidemigration from the underground facility to the acccessible environment.DOE estimates that as many as 350 shallow and 70 deep exploratory boreholesmay be emplaced by the time site characterization has been completed atthe Yucca Mountain site. Decommissioning may not occur for up to 100 yearsafter commencement of repository operations. Because the final design forseals will likely have been modified from the initial license applicationdesign (LAD), DOE is viewing the seal LAD as serving two primary functions.As set forth in DOE's SCP for the Yucca Mountain candidate site, the sealLAD is to establish that: (1) ``* * * technology for constructing sealsis reasonably available;'' and (2) ``* * * there is reasonable assurancethat seals have been designed so that, following permanent closure, theydo not become pathways that compromise the geologic repository's abilityto meet the post-closure performance objectives.''  To establish the availability of technology for seal construction, DOEhas identified at least 31 site properties that need to be characterizedin determining necessary seal characteristics. These properties includesaturated hydraulic conductivity of alluvium near shafts, the quantityof water reaching the seals due to surface-flooding events, and erosionpotential in the shaft vicinity. The SCP also discusses material propertiesthat need to be identified to determine sealing components such as initialand altered hydrologic properties of materials.  The SCP indicates that DOE is planning to use crushed tuff and cementsin the sealing program at the Yucca Mountain candidate site. The statedadvantages of using tuff include minimizing degradation of seal materialand avoiding disruption of ambient ground-water chemistry.  DOE's current design concept for meeting the overall performance objectivesincludes a combination of sealing and drainage. Seal requirements may bereduced in part by: (1) Limiting the amount of surface water that may enterboreholes, shafts, and ramps; (2) selecting borehole, shaft, and ramp locationsand orientiation that provide long flow paths from the emplaced waste tothe accessible environment above the repository; and (3) maintaining asufficient rate of drainage below the repository horizon level so thatwater can be shunted past the waste packages without contacting them. Although DOE's program is focusing on seals for the Yucca Mountain candidatesite, the Commission finds no basis for diminished confidence that an acceptableseal can be developed for candidated sites in different geologic media.The Commission finds no evidence to suggest that it can not continue tohave reasonable assurance that borehold, shaft, ramp, and repository sealscan be developed to meet 10 CFR part 60 performance objectives.  <T3>1.B. Relevant Issues That Have Arisen Since the Commission's OriginalDecision  </T3>1.B.1 In support of its argument on technical feasibility, the Commissionstated in its 1984 Waste Confidence Decision that ``* * * DOE's programis providing information on site characteristics at a sufficiently largenumber and variety of sites and geologic media to support the expectationthat one or more technically acceptable sites will be identified.'' TheNWPAA required, however, that DOE suspend site-specific site characterizationactivities under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 at all sites otherthan the Yucca Mountain, NV site.  Under the NWPAA, the DOE program has been redirected to characterize candidaterepository sites in sequence rather than simultaneously. If the Yucca Mountainsite is found to be unsuitable, DOE must terminate site characterizationactivities there and provide Congress with a recommendation for furtureaction, such as the charaterizaiton of another site. Because characterizationof multiple sites now appears to be more directly related to the timingof repository availability than to the technical feasibility of geologicdisposal as a concept, consideration of the Commission's aforementioned1984 statement in light of the NWPAA will be discussed under Finding 2. 1.B.2. What is the relationship, if any of the ``S-3 Proceeding'' to thecurrent review of the Commission's 1984 Waste Confidence Findings? Wouldthe planned revision of the S-3 rulemaking be affected if the Commissionhad to qualify its current confidence in the technical feasibility of safedisposal?In its decision to remand to NRC the questions of whether safe offsitestorage would be available to 2007-2009, or, if not, whether spent fuelcould be safely stored onsite past those dates, the U.S. Circuit Courtof Appeals observed that the issues of storage and disposal of nuclearwaste were being considered by the Commission in an ongoing generic proceedingknown as the ``S-3'' Proceeding.The S-3 Proceeding was the outgrowth of efforts to address genericallythe NEPA requirement for an evaluation of the environmental impact of operationof a light water reactor (LWR). Table S-3 assigned numerical values forenvironmental costs resulting from uranium fuel cycle activities to supportone year of LWR operation. NRC promulgated the S-3 rule in April 1974.In July 1976, the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals found that Table S-3 wasinadequately supported by the record regarding reprocessing of spent fueland radioactive waste management, in part because the Commission, in reachingits assessment, had relied heavily on testimony of NRC staff that the problemof waste disposal would be resolved.When the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals issued the remand on what were tobecome the ``Waste Confidence'' issues in May 1979, NRC had pending beforeit the final amended S-3 rule. The Court regarded the resolution of theissue of waste disposal in the S-3 proceeding as being related to the issueraised by the petitioners in the appeals of the NRC decisions on the expansionof spent fuel storage capacity. The Court said that the `` * * * dispositionof the S-3 proceeding, although it has a somewhat different focus, mayhave a bearing on the pending cases.''The Commission approved the final S-3 rule in July 1979. In October 1979,the Commission issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) on the WasteConfidence issues in response to the remand by the Court of Appeals. Inthe NPRM, the Commission stated that the proceeding would `` * * * drawupon the record compiled in the Commission's recently concluded rulemakingon the environmental impacts of the nuclear fuel cycle, and that the recordcomplied herein will be available for use in the general fuel cycle ruleupdate discussed in that rulemaking.''In the final Table S-3 rule issued in 1979, the Commission had said that`` * * * bedded salt sites can be found which will provide effective isolationof radioactive waste from the biosphere.'' When the Commission issued the1984 Waste Confidence Decision, part of the basis for the discussion ofwaste management and disposal in the August 1979 final S-3 rule had changed.For example, in 1984 the repository program was proceeding under the NWPA,which required that DOE recommend three sites for site characterization.Although NRC is preparing to amend the S-3 Table, and add a new appendixto explain the basis for and significance of the data in the table, itis unlikely that the revisions will have any impact on the Commission'sgeneric findings in the Waste Confidence proceeding. Nor is it likely thatthis reexamination of the Waste Confidence findings will affect the S-3rule; the Waste Confidence Proceeding is not intended to make quantitativejudgments about the environmental costs of waste disposal. Unless the Commission,in a future review of the Waste Confidence decision, finds that it no longerhas confidence in the technical feasibility of disposal in a mined geologicrepository, the Commission will not consider it necessary to review theS-3 rule when it reexamines its Waste Confidence findings in the future.1.B.3. To what extent do developments in spent fuel disposal technologyoutside of the United States (e.g., Swedish waste package designs) enhanceNRC's confidence in the technical feasibility of disposal of high-levelwaste and spent fuel?Spent fuel disposal technology is the subject of extensive research investigationin both Europe and North America. Advances in this technology are beingcommunicated to the NRC staff both through bilateral agreements and thepresentation of research results at international meetings.Outside the United States, studies of spent fuel as a waste form are nowbeing conducted primarily in Canada and Sweden, although both France andWest Germany have small programs in this area. The Swedish studies havebeen mainly concerned with boiling water reactor (BWR) spent fuel, whereasthe Canadian studies focus on spent fuel from that country's CANDU reactors,which use unenriched uranium in a core immersed in ``heavy'' water madefrom deuterium. BWR and CANDU fuel, like pressurized water reactor (PWR)fuel, are uranium dioxide fuels clad in zircaloy. However, the burnup ratesfor these three fuel types vary considerably. Ongoing research studieson spent fuel include: work on the characterization of spent fuel as awaste form; the corrosion of spent fuel and its dissolution under oxidizingand reducing conditions; the radiolysis of ground water in the near vicinityof the spent fuel, and its effects on the dissolution of the fuel; andthe development of models to predict the leaching of spent fuel over longtime periods. The results of this work are steadily increasing our understandingof spent fuel as a waste form.High-level radioactive waste, whether it is spent reactor fuel or wastefrom reprocessing, must be enclosed in an outer canister as part of thewaste package. The canister surrounding the waste is expected to preventthe release of radioactivity during its handling at the repository sitebefore emplacement. After emplacement in the repository, it is expectedto prevent the release of radioactivity for a specified period of timeafter the repository is closed, by providing a barrier to protect the wastefrom coming into contact with the ground water.For practical reasons, canister materials may be divided into the followingclasses: (1) Completely or partially thermodynamically stable materialssuch as copper; (2) passive materials such as stainless steel, titanium,Hastelloy, Inconel, and aluminum; (3) corroding or sacrificial materialssuch as lead and steel; and (4) non-metallic materials such as aluminaand titanium dioxide ceramics and cement.Sweden has been conducting an extensive canister research program overthe past several years. The main canister of interest is copper, but titanium,carbon steel, and alumina and titanium dioxide are also being studied asreasonable alternatives, should unexpected problems be discovered withusing pure copper.The present Swedish canister design is a 100-mm thick copper container(as described previously in section A.2.a.), which is claimed to providecontainment, in conjunction with an appropriate backfill material, fora period on the order of one million years. The critical factors for theisolation period for copper canisters are: (1) The presence of corrosivesubstances such as sulfphide ions in the ground water; (2) the possibilityof these substances reaching the canister surface; and (3) the degree ofinhomogeneity, or pitting, of the resulting corrosion. Studies are continuingto obtain more information on pitting corrosion of copper and on techniquesfor welding thick-walled copper containers.Several conceptual designs for canisters for the safe disposal of unreprocessedspent fuel have also been developed in Canada. One canister design optionis the supported-shell, metal-matrix concept, which involves packing thespent fuel bundles into a thin corrosive-resistant shell and casting theremaining space with a low melting point metal or alloy. Structural supportfor the shell would be provided by the resulting metal matrix. Lead isa possible matrix material because of its favorable casting properties,cost, and low melting point.Other supported shell canister concepts include the packed-particulateand structurally-supported designs. In these designs, a thin outer shellis supported by a particulate material packed around a steel internal structurethat contains the spent fuel bundles. Several materials have been identifiedfor the fabrication of the corrosion resistant outer shell, including commerciallypure and low-alloy titanium, high nickel-based alloys such as Inconel 625,and pure copper. Detailed designs have been produced for all three typesof supported shell canisters incorporating either a titanium or nickelalloy shell less than 6-mm thick. A conceptual design has also been producedfor a copper-shell structurally-supported canister and a metal-matrix containerwith a relatively thick (25-mm) copper shell and a lead matrix material.This last canister is intended to contain 72 used CANDU fuel bundles infour layers of 18 bundles each.Both the Canadian and Swedish conceptual designs for the disposal of spentfuel in canisters provide for surrounding the canister with backfill materialas part of the waste package when it is emplaced in the repository. Thisbackfill material would be packed around the canister to retard the movementof ground water and radionuclides. Investigations of backfill materialat the Stripa mine in Sweden have shown that bentonite and silica sandcan be employed successfully as backfill, both around the canister andin repository tunnels. A bentonite-silica mixture is the recommended backfillmaterial on the basis of its thermal and mechanical properties. Bentonitebackfills have been shown to produce hydraulic conductivities that arevery similar to the surrounding granite at Stripa. Problems concerningthe variability of bentonite samples from different geographic locationscan be eliminated if material from a single source is used. The presenceof sulfur and some organic material, including bacteria, in many bentonitesposes some problems related to microbially-accelerated corrosion. Treatmentwith hydrogen peroxide may be used to oxidize these organics. Heating thebentonite to 400 degrees C can also be effective, although this may alterthe crystal structure of the bentonite.Many countries intend to dispose of their high-level radioactive wasteby first converting the wastes into a solid, vitrified form after reprocessing.Since the leaching of the waste form by circulating ground water afterdisposal is the most likely mechanism by which the radionuclides mightbe returned to the biosphere, the waste form must be composed of a highlystable material with an extremely low solubility in ground water. Thus,the waste form itself should function as an immobilization agent to preventany significant release of radionuclides to the biosphere over very longtime periods. The two primary materials currently being considered foruse as solidified waste forms are borosilicate glass and SYNROC, a man-madetitanate ceramic material.SYNROC was initially developed in Australia as an alternative materialto borosilicate glass. It is composed primarily of three minerals (hollandite,zirconolite, and perovskite) which collectively have the capacity to acceptthe great majority of radioactive high-level waste constituents into theircrystal lattice strucuture. These three minerals, or closely related forms,occur naturally, and have been shown to have survived for many millionsof years in a wide range of natural environments. SYNROC has the propertyof being extremely resistant to leaching by ground water, particularlyat temperatures above 100 degrees C. In addition, the capacity of SYNROCto immobilize high-level wastes is not markedly impaired by high levelsof radiation damage.The high leach-resistance of SYNROC at elevated temperatures increasesthe range of geologic environments in which it may be used, such as deepgeologic repositories in both continental and marine environments.Research and development work on improving SYNROC production technologyis currently being done jointly in Australia and Japan. New methods ofusing metal alkoxides in the fabrication of SYNROC to obtain high homogeneityand lower leachability have recently been developed in Australia. The Japanesehave recently developed a new method that uses titanium hydroxide, as areducing agent to produce SYNROC with a high density and low leach rate.A pilot facility for the production of non-radioactive SYNROC is not inoperation in Australia, and a small pilot facility for producing SYNROCwith radioactive constituents is being completed in Japan.On the basis of current information from the foreign studies just describedon canisters, spent fuel as a waste form, backfill materials, and alternativesto borosilicate glass waste forms, the Commission concludes that thereis no basis for diminished confidence that an acceptable waste packagecan be developed for safe disposal of high-level waste and spent fuel.1.C. Conclusion on Finding 1The Commission has reexamined the basis for its First Finding in the 1984Waste Confidence Decision in light of subsequent program developments,and concludes that Finding 1 should be reaffirmed.The technical feasibility of a repository rests initially on identificationof acceptable sites. At this time, the Commission is not aware of any evidenceindicating that Yucca Mountain is not acceptable for site characterization.There are many outstanding questions regarding the licenseability of thesite, however, and they must be answered satisfactorily in order for NRCto issue a construction authorization for that site. If data obtained duringsite characterization indicate that the Yucca Mountain site is not suitablefor a repository, DOE is required by the NWPAA to terminate site characterizationactivities and report to Congress. Within six months of that determination,DOE must make a recommendation to Congress for further action to assurethe safe, permanent disposal of spent fuel and high-level waste. DOE couldrecommend, for example, that Congress authorize site characterization atother sites. Considering DOE's investigations of other potentially acceptablesites before its exclusive focus on Yucca Mountain, the Commission hasno reason to believe that, given adequate time and program resources, atechnically acceptable site cannot be found.The technical feasibility of geologic disposal also depends on the abilityto develop effective engineered barriers, such as waste packages. DOE iscurrently evaluating six candidate materials for waste containers, includingaustenitic steel and copper- and nickel-based alloys, and is planning waste-formtesting based on both spent fuel and high-level waste in borosilicate glass.On the basis of DOE's program, and results from Swedish investigationsof a copper waste container, the Commission is confident that, given arange of waste forms and conservative test conditions, the technology isavailable to design acceptable waste packages.In addition to the materials testing for the waste container and wasteform, there may be additional measures that can be taken to improve theeffectiveness of the engineered barriers. It is known, for example, thatthe heat-loading characteristics of the wastes diminish with time. Also,the longer wastes are stored before disposal, the smaller will be the quantitiesof radionuclides available for transport to the accessible environment.It is also technically feasible to separate from radioactive wastes theradionuclides that constitute the principal source of heat from the nuclidesof greatest long-term concern. The former radionuclides, mainly fissionproducts such as cesium-137 and strontium-90, could then be stored fora period of years while the fission products decay to the point where theycould be disposed of either in a manner that does not require the degreeof confinement provided by a geologic repository, or in a repository withless concern for thermal disturbance of the host rock's expected wasteisolation properties. Meantime, the longer-lived remaining radionuclides,such as transuranic wastes with elements heavier than uranium, could bedisposed of in a repository away from the fission products and withoutthe high thermal loadings that would otherwise have to be considered inpredicting the long-term waste isolation performance of the geologic setting.France, Great Britain, and Japan are currently pursuing this waste managementstrategy or a variant of it.The Commission emphasizes here that it does not believe that recyclingtechnolgies are required for the safety or feasibility of deep geologicdisposal in the United States. Other countries, such as Canada, the FederalRepublic of Germany, and Sweden are pursuing disposal strategies basedon a similar view. Reprocessing, if employed in its current stage of development,would result in additional exposures to radiation and volumes of radioactivewastes to be disposed of. For the purpose of finding reasonable assurancein the technical feasibility of geologic disposal, however, it is worthnoting that technology is currently available to permit additional engineeringcontrol of waste forms if, for reasons not now foreseen, such control weredeemed desirable at some future time. Meanwhile, the Commission continuesto have confidence that safe geologic disposal is technically feasiblefor both spent fuel and high-level waste.DOE's current reference design for the waste package does not include backfillor packing around waste containers in the emplacement boreholes. Neitheris required under NRC rules so long as DOE can show that applicable regulatorycriteria and objectives will be met. An air gap between the container andthe host rock is currently one of the barriers in DOE's design for meetingthe performance objective. DOE has conducted investigations on a varietyof candidate materials for backfill in a variety of geologic media, andthe Commission finds no basis to qualify its past confidence that backfillmaterials can be developed, if needed, to meet applicable NRC requirements.The current reference design for sealing boreholes, shafts, ramps and theunderground facility at the Yucca Mountain candidate site employs crushedtuff and cement. Regardless of the geologic medium of the candidate site,DOE will have to show that the license application design meets NRC post-closureperformance objectives. The Commission continues to have reasonable assurancethat DOE's program will lead to identification of acceptable sealant materialsfor meeting these objectives.Overall, from its reexamination of issues related to the technical feasibilityof geologic disposal, the Commission concludes that there is reasonableassurance that safe disposal of high-level waste and spent fuel in a minedgeologic repository is technically feasible.<ITAG tagnum="84">Original Finding 2 </ITAG>The Commission finds reasonable assurance that one or more mined geologicrepositories for commercial high-level waste and spent fuel will be availableby the years 2007-2009, and that sufficient repository capacity will beavailable within 30 years beyond expiration of any reactor operating licenseto dispose of existing commercial high-level radioactive waste and spentfueld originating in that reactor and generated up to that time. <ITAG tagnum="84">Proposed Finding 2 </ITAG>The Commission finds reasonable assurance that at least one mined geologicrepository will be available within the first quarter of the twenty-firstcentury, and that sufficient repository capacity will be available within30 years beyond the licensed life for operation of any reactor to diposeof the commercial high-level radioactive waste and spent fuel originatingin such reactor and generated up to that time. 2.A. Issues Considered in Commission's 1984 Decision on Finding 2 <ITAG tagnum="81">2.A.1. Finding Technically Acceptable Sites in a Timely Fashion </ITAG>In order for the Commission to find that any candidate site for a repositoryis technically acceptable (that is, in compliance with NRC licensing requirements),the site must undergo comprehensive site characterization to assess itshydrologic, geologic, geochemical, and rock mechanics properties. It ispossible that a site may be found unacceptable on the basis of early in-situtesting or other site characterization activities. It will not be possible,however, for the NRC staff to take a position before a licensing boardthat a site will meet NRC requirements for construction authorization untilthe results of all site characterization activities are available. Eventhen, the staff may conclude that the evidence from site characterizationdoes not constitute reasonable assurance that NRC performance objectiveswill be met. Also, the results of the licensing hearings on constructionauthorization cannot be predicted. If construction is authorized and whenit is substantially complete, DOE is required to obtain, in addition tothe construction authorization permit, a license to receive and possesswaste at the geologic repository operations area in order to commence repositoryoperations. These considerations argue for maintaining the ready availabilityof alternatives sites if, after several years, site characterization orlicensing activities bring to light difficulties at the leading candidatesite. In support of its argument on technical feasibility, the Commission statedin its 1984 Waste Confidence Decision that ``* * * DOE's program is providinginformation on site characteristics at a sufficiently large number andvariety of sites and geologic media to support the expectation that oneor more technically acceptable sites will be identified.'' At the time,DOE was required under the NWPA to characterize three candidate repositorysites. The NWPAA had a major impact on DOE's repository program, however. Underthe NWPAA, DOE was required to suspend site-specific activities at theHanford, WA and Deaf Smith County, TX sites, which had been approved bythe President for site characterization for the first repository. Redirectionof the repository program to single-site characterization (or, if necessary,sequential site characterization if the Yucca Mountain site is found tobe unsuitable) will permit DOE to concentrate its efforts and resourceson information gathering at a single site, as opposed to spreading outits efforts over a range of sites. The possible schedular benefits to single-sitecharacterization, however, must be weighed for the purposes of this Findingagainst the potential for additional delays in repository availabilityif the Yucca Mountain site is found to be unsuitable. By focusing DOE sitecharacterization activities on Yucca Mountain, the NWPAA has essentiallymade it necessary for that site to be found suitable if the 2007-2009 timeframefor repository availability in the Commission's 1984 Decision is to bemet. Clearly, the Commission cannot be certain at this time that the YuccaMountain site will be acceptable. Although Commission has no reason to believe that another technically acceptablesite can not be found if the Yucca Mountain site proves unsuitable, severalfactors raise reasonable doubts as to the availability of even one repositoryby 2007-2009. These include: (1) The current reliance on a single sitewith no concurrently available alternatives; (2) the probability that sitecharacterization activities will not proceed entirely without problems;and (3) the history of schedular slippages since passage of the NWPA. Forexample, DOE's schedule for the first repository slipped five years (from1998 to 2003) between January 1983, when the NWPA was enacted, and January1987, when the first Draft Mission Plan Amendment was issued. The schedulefor excavation of the exploratory shaft for the Yucca Mountain site slippedby more than three years since the issuance of the PDS in March 1986. DOEhas cited numerous reasons for past program slippages, including the needfor a consultation process with States and Tribes, Congressional actions(e.g., the barring of funds in the 1987 budget appropriation for drillingexploratory shafts), and DOE's recognition that the EIS and license applicationwould require more technical information than previously planned. Given this history of delays, and given its understanding of current developments,the Commission can not be sure that current milestones for the repositoryprogram will be met, at least in the foreseeable future. For example, DOEhas taken the position, with which NRC agrees, that sinking of exploratoryshafts should not occur before it has a qualified quality assurance (QA)program in place. The Commission believes that the aggressive, success-orientedschedule for this milestone has not allowed for unexpected developments.Indeed, the effort to develop an approvable QA program has in itself identifiedproblems in design control and other processes that must be resolved inorder to establish a fully-qualified program that addresses all applicableNRC licensing requirements. Thus, although the NWPAA is a clear and strong reaffirmation of Congressionalsupport for the timely development of a repository, the Commission in thisWaste Confidence review cannot ignore the potential for delay in repositoryavailability if the Yucca Mountain site, or any other single site designatedfor site characterization, is found to be unsuitable. Without alternativesites undergoing simultaneous characterization or even surface-based testing,DOE will have to begin characterizing another site if the site currentlyselected for characterization proves unsuitable. The earlier a determinationof unsuitability can be made, the smaller the impact of such a findingwould be on the overall timing of repository availability. DOE has estimated conservatively that it would required approximately 25years to begin site screening for a second repository, perform site characterization,submit an EIS and license applications, and await authorizations beforethe repository could be ready to receive waste. In its June 1987 MissionPlan amendment, DOE stated ``It * * * seems prudent to plan that site-specificscreening leading to the identification of potentially acceptable sitesshould start about 25 years before the start of waste acceptance for disposal.''DOE went on to say that it considered this estimate to be conservativebecause it does not account for expected schedular benefits from the firstrepository program, including improvements in such areas as site screening,site characterization, and performance assessment techniques. Although DOE's estimate was permitted on the successful completion of aprogram for the first of two repositories, schedular benefits from improvementsin the understanding of waste isolation processes would still be available.The glass waste form from the Defense Waste Processing Facility now underconstruction at Savannah River, SC, for example, will be available fortesting under simulated repository conditions well before the turn of thecentury under current DOE schedules, and improvements in the modellingof spent fuel behavior within waste canisters can be applied in performanceassessments largely irrespective of the geology of a site. It may alsobe pertinent that when DOE made its 25-year estimate for the second repositoryprogram in mid-1987, the law at the time required the simultaneous characterizationof three sites, so that DOE could not proceed to develop one site for arepository until the completion of characterization at the site that requiredthe most time. Although it is still possible for a repository to be available by 2007-2009if the current schedule does not incur major additional delays, the Commissiondoes not believe it would be prudent to reaffirm the Agency's 1984 findingof reasonable assurance that the 2007-2009 timetable will be met. As theCourt of Appeals noted in remanding this isue to NRC, the ultimate determinationof whether a disposal facility will be available when needed ``* * * cannever rise above a prediction.'' The Commission is in the position of havingto reach a definitive finding on events which are almost two decades away.We believe that the institutional timescale for this question can morerealistically be framed in decades than in years. As the program proceedsinto the next century, it will become easier for NRC to make more definitiveassessments, if necessary, of the time a repository will be available.It should be noted here that the basis for the 2007-2009 timeframe in theCourt remand on the ``Waste Confidence'' issues has changed in the pastfive years. These dates no longer represent the expected dates of expirationof the Vermont Yankee and Prairie Island facilities. When the operatinglicenses were originally issued for nuclear power reactors, license durationswere computed on the basis of a 40-year operating lifetime starting fromthe date of the construction permit (CP) for the facility. For many facilities,five years or more elapsed from the date of issuance of the CP until issuanceof the operating license (OL). In response to requests from utilities,the NRC staff has agreed to extend the dates of expiration of the OLs bycomputing the 40-year period of the license from the date of issuance ofthe OL instead of from the date of the CP. The NRC staff has already changedthe expiration date for Prairie Island Units 1 and 2 from the year 2008to the years 2013 and 2014. The staff currently expects Vermont Yankeeto request a change in its current expiration date of December 11, 2007.On the basis of the date of issuance of the OL for Vermont Yankee, it iseligible for extension of its operating license expiration to March 2012.Therefore, if the remand were to occur today, NRC would likely be evaluatingthe availability of a repository by 2012-2014, as these years are expectedto represent the timeframe in which the OLs of the Vermont Yankee and PrairieIsland facilities are due to expire. In light of all these considerations, the Commission believes it can havereasonable assurance that at least one repository will be available withinthe first quarter of the twenty-first century. This estimate is based onthe time it would take for DOE to proceed from site screening to repositoryoperation at a site other than Yucca Mountain, if this should prove necessary.Assuming for the sake of conservatism that Yucca Mountain would not befound suitable for repository development, it is reasonable to expect thatDOE would be able to reach this conclusion by the year 2000. This wouldleave 25 years for the attainment of repository operations at another site.<ITAG tagnum="81">2.A.2. Timely Development of Waste Packages and Engineered Barriers</ITAG>DOE's current conceptual design for the waste package is discussed in theSCP for the Yucca Mountain site. As information is obtained from site characterizationactivities and laboratory studies, the conceptual design will evolve insuccessive stages into the Advanced Conceptual Design (ACD), the LAD, andthe final procurement and construction design. DOE has identified fourareas of investigation related to the waste package LAD: (1) Waste packageenvironment; (2) waste form and materials testing; (3) design, analysis,fabrication, and prototype testing; and (4) performance assessment. Numerousuncertainties exist in each of these areas. DOE's testing program willattempt to reduce uncertainties in these areas where possible. For example,<T3>in-situ</T3> testing is expected to decrease significantly uncertaintiesregarding the repository host rock mass in which the waste packages willbe emplaced. In the area of performance assessment, however, where resultsof relatively short-term testing of complex rock-waste-ground water interactionsmust be extrapolated over as many as 10,000 years, it may be necessaryto rely more heavily on the use of simplifying assumptions and boundingconditions than in other areas of investigation.As discussed under Finding 1, the Commission continues to have reasonableassurance that waste packages and engineered barriers can be developedwhich will contribute to meeting NRC performance objectives for the repository.The timing of availability of a complete and high quality waste packageand engineered barrier LAD, specifically their availability on a schedulewhich would permit repository operation by 2007-2009, is more difficultto assess at this time. In contrast with the technical feasibility issuesdiscussed under Finding 1, development of acceptable waste packages andengineered barriers for a repository in the 2007-2009 timeframe does dependon the overall acceptability of the Yucca site. If the site is found tobe unsuitable, waste package and engineered barrier development will haveto begin for a different site, because, under the NWPAA, DOE may not carryout site characterization and waste package development work at sites otherthan the Yucca Mountain site. Although much of the work related to waste form, materials, and performanceassessment for the waste package can proceed independently of <T3>in-situ </T3>testing, the investigations related to waste package environmentdepend on the schedule for this testing. DOE's current schedule calls forcompleting the ACD for the waste package in 1992, and the waste packageLAD in 1994. The ability to meet these dates will depend on whether DOEis able to resolve outstanding QA issues which have impeded shaft sinkingand <T3>in-situ </T3>testing. In sum, the Commission is not aware of any scientific or technical problemsso difficult as to preclude development of a waste package and engineeredbarrier for a repository at Yucca Mountain to be available within the firstquarter of the twenty-first century. Moreover, even given the uncertaintyregarding the ultimate finding of site acceptability, and the uncertaintyconcerning the range of site-related parameters for which the engineeredfacility and waste package will have to be designed, the Commission findsreasonable assurance that waste package and engineered barrier developmentcan be completed on a schedule that would permit repository operation withinthe first quarter of the twenty-first century. If necessary (that is, ifYucca Mountain were found unsuitable late in the program), DOE could initiatesite characterization and develop waste packages and engineered barriersat another site or sites and still commence operation before the end ofthe first quarter of that century. <ITAG tagnum="81">2.A.3. Institutional Uncertainties </ITAG>2.A.3.a. <T3>Measures for dealing with Federal-State-local concerns. </T3>In its1984 Waste Confidence Decision, the Commission found that the NWPA shouldhelp to minimize the potential that differences between the Federal Governmentand States and Indian tribes will substantially disrupt or delay the respositoryprogram. The Commission noted that the NWPA reduced uncertainties regardingthe role of affected States and tribes in repository site selection andevaluation. The Commission also said that the decision-making process setup by the NWPA provides a detailed, step-by-step approach that builds inregulatory involvement, which should also provide confidence to Statesand tribes that the program will proceed on a technically sound and acceptablebasis. Despite the expected and continuing State opposition to DOE sitingactivities, the Commission has found no institutional developments sincethat time that would fundamentally disturb its 1984 conclusions on thispoint. NRC regulatory involvement, for example, has indeed been built into theprocess. DOE has continued its interactions with NRC regarding repositoryprogram activities since the Commission's 1984 Waste Confidence decisionwas issued. NRC provided comments to DOE on major program documents suchas the Siting Guidelines and the PDS as required by the NWPA, and NRC concurredon those documents. NRC also reviewed and provided comments to DOE on theDEAs and FEAs. In the December 22, 1986 letter to DOE on the FEAs, theNRC staff noted that ``* * * significant efforts were made by DOE to respondto each of the NRC staff major comments on the DEAs, and in fact, manyof these comments have been resolved.'' NRC provided comments to DOE onthe 1987 Draft Mission Plan Amendment, and DOE responded to most of thesecomments in the Final Mission Plan Amendment provided to Congress on June9, 1987. Since enactment of the NWPAA in December 1987, DOE-NRC interactions havefocused on the Yucca Mountain site. In January 1988, DOE issued the ConsultationDraft Site Characterization Plan (CDSCP) for the Yucca Mountain site. TheNRC staff provided comments in the form of draft and final ``point papers''on the CDSCP. The NRC comments included several objections related to:(1) The failure to recognize the range of alternative conceptual modelsof the Yucca Mountain site; (2) the status of the quality assurance (QA)plans for site characterization activities; and (3) concerns related tothe exploratory shaft facility. Although the December 1988 SCP shows improvementover the CDSCP, NRC continues to have an objection involving the need forimplementing a baselined QA program before beginning site characterizationand an objection involving the need for DOE to demonstrate the adequacyof both the ESF design and the design control process. DOE is committedto having a qualified QA program in place before sinking the exploratoryshaft at the Yucca Mountain site. DOE has also taken measures to clarify and institutionalize the roles ofother Federal agencies in addition to NRC. In the Draft 1988 Mission PlanAmendment, DOE described interactions with these agencies. DOE has a Memorandumof Understanding (MOU) with the Mine Safety and Health Administration ofthe Department of Labor for technical support and oversight for shaft constructionand other site characterization activities, and with the Department ofTransportation to define the respective responsibilities of the two agenciesin the waste disposal program. DOE also has interagency agreements withthe Bureau of Mines and the U.S. Geological Survey of the Department ofthe Interior. DOE's efforts to address the concerns of States, local governments, andIndian tribes have met with mixed results. For example, DOE has not succeededin finalizing any consultation and cooperation (Candamp;C) agreements asrequired under Section 117(c) of the NWPA, as amended. These agreementswere to help resolve State and Tribal concerns about public health andsafety, environmental, and economic impacts of a repository. Publicationof the Siting Guidelines under section 112(a) of the NWPA resulted in numerouslawsuits challenging the validity of the Guidelines. Similarly, the FEAswere challenged in the Ninth Circuit by affected States and tribes. The NWPAA did not curtail financial assistance to affected States and tribes,except to redefine and redistribute it if DOE and a State or tribe enterinto a benefits agreement. The State of Nevada and affected local governmentsare currently receiving financial assistance. DOE has attempted to negotiatean agreement with the State of Nevada for monetary benefits under section170 of the NWPAA. This section would provide for payments of $10 millionper year before receipt of spent fuel, and $20 million per year after receiptof spent fuel until closure of the repository. These payments would bein addition to certain monetary benefits for which the State is eligibleunder the NWPA, as amended. Also under a benefits agreement, a Review Panelwould be constituted for the purpose of advising DOE on matters relatedto the repository, and for assisting in the presentation of State, tribal,and local perspectives to DOE. The beneficiary to a benefits agreementmust waive its right to disapprove the recommendation of the site for arepository and its rights to certain impact assistance under sections 116and 118 of the NWPA, as amended. To date, the State of Nevada has declinedDOE's offer to negotiate a benefits agreement. The NWPAA introduced several new organizational entities to the repositoryprogram with responsibilities that may contribute to resolving concernsof Federal, State, and local governments involved in the program. Undersection 503 of the NWPAA, the Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board (NWTRB)is to evaluate the technical and scientific validity of DOE activitiesunder the NWPAA, including site characterization and activities relatedto packaging or transportation of spent fuel. The NWPAA also establishedthe Office of Nuclear Waste Negotiator, who is to seek to negotiate termsunder which a State or Indian tribe would be willing to host a repositoryor MRS facility at a technically qualified site. Among the duties of theNegotiator is consultation with Federal agencies such as NRC on the suitabilityof any potential site for site characterization. At the time of this writing, the President has not appointed the Negotiator.On February 24, 1989 Congressman Morris K. Udall and Senator J. BennettJohnston requested that the President take action to appoint an individualto this office. A Negotiator could contribute to the timely success ofthe respository program by providing an alternative site to the Yucca Mountainsite that would still have to be techically acceptable, but that wouldenjoy the advantage of reduced institutional uncertainties resulting fromopposition to State or affected Indian tribes. An additional measure which may facilitate documentation and communicationof concerns related to a repository is the Licensing Support System (LSS).The LSS is to provide full text search capability of and easy access todocuments related to the licensing of the repository. Although the primarypurpose of the LSS is to expedite NRC's review of the construction authorizationapplication for a repository, it will be an effective mechanism by whichall LSS participants, including the State and local governments, can acquireearly access to documents relevant to a repository licensing decision.DOE has the responsibility for designing the LSS and bearing the costsassociated with it, and NRC will be responsible for implementing it. Procedures for the use of the LSS are part of revisions to 10 CFR Part2, NRC's Rules of Practice for the adjudicatory proceeding on the applicationto receive and possess waste at a repository. These revisions were theresult of a ``negotiated rulemaking'' process in which affected partiesmeet to reach concensus on the proposed rule. The members of the negotiatingcommittee included: DOE; NRC; State of Nevada; coalition of Nevada localgovernments; coalition of industry groups; and a coalition of nationalenvironmental groups. The coalition of industry groups dissented on thefinal text of the proposed rule, but the negotiating process enabled NRCto produce a proposed rule reflecting the consensus of most of the interestedparties on an important repository licensing issue. NRC is committed to safe disposal of radioactive waste and the protectionof public health and safety and the environment. Any State with a candidatesite for a repository should be assured that a repository will not be licensedif it does not meet NRC criteria. NRC has its own program for interactionwith the State of Nevada and affected units of local government, and willcontinue to provide information to Nevada and consider State concerns asrequested. Given the difficult nature of siting a repository, the Commission believesthat the NWPA, as amended, has achieved the proper balance between providingfor participation by affected parties and providing for the exercise ofCongressional authority to carry out the national program for waste disposal.The NWPAA provides adequate opportunity for interaction between DOE andother Federal agencies, States, tribes, and local governments such thatconcerns can be presented to DOE for appropriate action. Both the NRC andthe State or tribe can exercise considerable prerogative regarding repositorydevelopment. The State or tribe may disapprove the recommendation thatthe site undergo repository development. This disapproval can be overriddenonly by vote of both houses of Congress within 90 days of continuous session.If the State disapproval is overridden, DOE may submit an application forauthorization to construct the repository, and, if approved, a subsequentapplication to receive and possess waste for emplacement. NRC will makedecisions on the license applications according to the requirements ofits statutory mission. Despite the complexity of the overall process andthe strong views of the participants in it, the Commission sees no compellingreason to conclude that current institutional arrangements are inadequateto the task of resolving State, Federal, and local concerns in time topermit a repository to be available within the first quarter of the twenty-firstcentury. 2.A.3.b. Continuity of the management of the waste program. At the timethe Commission issued its 1984 Waste Confidence Decision, the possibilitythat DOE functions would be transferred to another Federal agency was citedas the basis for concerns that the resolution of the radioactive wastedisposal problem would likely undergo further delays. The Commission respondedthat in the years since the Administration had proposed to dismantle DOEin September 1981, Congress had not acted on the proposal. The Commissionfurther stated that even if DOE were abolished, the nuclear waste programwould simply be transferred to another agency. The Commission did not viewthe potential transfer in program management as resulting in a significantloss of momentum in the waste program. The commission also concluded thatthe enactment of the NWPA, which gave DOE lead responsibility for repositorydevelopment, further reduced uncertainties as to the continuity of managementof the waste program.Section 303 of the NWPA did, however, require the Secretary of Energy to``* * * undertake a study with respect to alternative approaches to managingthe construction and operation of all civilian radioactive waste facilities,including the feasibility of establishing a private corporation for suchpurpose.'' To carry out this requirement, DOE established the AdvisoryPanel on Alternative Means of Financing and Managing Radioactive WasteFacilities, which came to be known as the ``AMFM'' Panel. The Panel's finalreport, issued in December 1984, concluded that several organizationalforms are more suited than DOE for managing the waste program, includingan independent Federal agency or commission, a public corporation, anda private corporation. The report identified a public corporation as thepreferred alternative on the basis of criteria developed by the Panel foran acceptable waste management organization. In particular, the reportindicated that a public corporation would be stable, highly mission-oriented,able to maintain credibility with stakeholders, and more responsive toregulatory control than a Federal executive agency.Commenting on the AMFM Panel's report in April 1985, DOE recommended retainingthe present management structure of the waste program at least throughthe siting and licensing phase of the program. Congress did not take actionto implement the Panel's recommendations, and DOE's management of the wasteprogram has remained uninterrupted.By enacting the NWPAA, Congress effectively reaffirmed DOE's continuedmanagement of the waste program. Congress did not revise DOE's role asthe lead agency responsible for development of a repository and an MRS.Congress did establish several new entities for the purpose of advisingDOE on matters related to the waste program, such as the NWTRB and theReview Panel, to be established if DOE and a State or tribe enter intoa benefits agreement under section 170 of the NWPAA. Congress providedfurther indication of its intent that DOE maintain management control ofthe waste program for the foreseeable future in requiring, under section161, that the Secretary of DOE ``* * * report to the President and to Congresson or after January 1, 2007, but not later than January 1, 2010, on theneed for a second repository.''This is not to say, however, that there have been no management problemsin the DOE program. Since the enactment of the NWPA in 1983, only one ofthe five Directors of DOE's Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management(OCRWM) has held the position on a permanent basis. Inadequate progresstoward an operating repository has concerned several Congressional observers,including Senator J. Bennett Johnston, Chairman of the Senate Energy andNatural Resources Committee. In February 1989 confirmation hearings forthen-Secretary-of-Energy-designate James Watkins, Senator Johnston stronglycriticized mounting cost projections and lack of progress in the program,and called for new and stronger management.Whether the management structure of the respository development programshould in fact be changed is a decision best left to others. The Commissionbelieves that a finding on the likely availability of a repository shouldtake management problems into account, but finds no basis to diminish thedegree of assurance in its 1984 conclusion on this issue. Events sincethe submission of the AMFM Panel report do not indicate that there willbe a fundamental change in the continuity of the management structure ofthe program any time soon. In addition, it cannot be assumed that the programwould encounter signficantly less difficulty with a new management structurethan it would continuing under the present one. Under either scenario,however, the Commission believes it would be more prudent to expect respositoryoperations after the 2007-2009 timeframe than before it. Neither the problemsof a new management structure nor those of the existing one are likelyto prevent the achievement of repository operations within the first quarterof the next century, however.2.A.3.c. Continued funding of the nuclear waste management program. Section302 of the NWPA authorized DOE to enter into contracts with generatorsof electricity from nuclear reactors for payment of 1.0 mill (0.1 cent)per kilowatt-hour of net electricity generated in exchange for a FederalGovernment commitment to take title to the spent fuel from those reactors.In the 1984 Waste Confidence Decision, the Commission noted that all suchcontracts with utilities had been executed. After the 1984 Decision, then-PresidentReagan decided that defense high-level wastes are to be collocated withcivilian wastes from commercial nuclear power reactors. DOE's Office ofDefense Programs is to pay the full cost of disposal of defense waste inthe repository.DOE is required under section 302(a)(4) of the NWPA, as amended, ``* ** annually [to] review the amount of the fees * * * to evaluate whethercollection of the fees will provide sufficient revenues to offset the costs* * *.'' In the June 1987 Nuclear Waste Fund Fee Adequacy Report, DOE recommendedthat the 1.0 mill per kilowatt-hour fee remain unchanged. This assessmentwas based on the assumption that an MRS facility would open in 1998, thefirst repository would open in 2003, and the second repository in 2023.These assumptions do not reflect changes in the waste program brought aboutby the NWPAA enacted in December 1987. Two such changes with significantpotential impacts were the suspension of site-specific activities relatedto the second repository until at least 2007, and the linkage between MRSconstruction and operation and the granting of a repository constructionauthorization, which will probably occur no earlier than 1998.According to the Draft 1988 Mission Plan Amendment, DOE should currentlybe preparing the 1988 fee-adequacy analysis on the basis of the changesto the waste program brought about by the NWPAA. The new fee adequacy reportwill reflect overall program cost savings to the utilities resulting from: (1) Limiting site characterization activities to a single site at YuccaMountain, NV; and (2) the DOE Office of Defense Programs' sharing otherprogram costs with generators of electricity ``* * * on the basis of numbersof waste canisters handled, the portion of the repository used for civilianor defense wastes, and the use of various facilities at the repository,''in addition to paying for activities solely for disposing of defense wastes.An additional factor which may eventually also contribute to the overalladequacy of Nuclear Waste Fund fees is the likelihood that a significantnumber of utilities will request renewals of reactor operating lifetimesbeyond their current OL expiration dates. OL renewal would provide additionaltime during which Nuclear Waste Fund fees could be adjusted, if necessary,to cover any future increase in per-unit costs of waste management anddisposal.The Commission recognizes the potential for program cost increases overestimates in the 1987 Nuclear Waste Fund Fee Adequacy Report. If thereis a significant delay in repository construction, for example, it is reasonableto assume that construction costs will escalate. There may also be additionalcosts associated with at-reactor dry cask storage of spent fuel, if DOEdoes not have a facility available to begin accepting spent fuel by the1998 date specified in the NWPA. These costs would be further increasedif one or more licensees were to become insolvent and DOE were requiredto assume responsibility for storage at affected reactors before 1998.The full impact of the program redirection resulting from the NWPAA andthe outlook for the timing of repository availability will continue tobe assessed annually. If it does appear that costs will exceed availablefunds, there is provision in the NWPA for DOE to request that Congressadjust the fee to ensure full-cost recovery. Thus, the Commission findsno reason for changing its basic conclusion that the long-term fundingprovisions of the Act should provide adequate financial support for theDOE program.2.A.3.d. DOE's schedule for repository development. At the time that the1984 Waste Confidence Decision was issued, the Nuclear Waste Policy Actof 1982, enacted in January 1983, had been in effect for less than 20 months.The NWPA had established numerous deadlines for various repository programmilestones. Under section 112(b)(1)(B), the NWPA set the schedule for recommendationof sites for characterization no later than January 1, 1985. Section 114(a)(2)specified that no later than March 31, 1987, with provision for a 12-monthextension of this deadline, the President was to recommend to Congressone of the three characterized sites qualified for an application for respositoryconstruction authorization. Under section 114(d), NRC was to issue itsdecision approving or disapproving the issuance of a construction authorizationnot later than January 1, 1989, or the expiration of three years afterthe date of submission of the application, whichever occurs later. Section302(a)(5)(B) required that contracts between DOE and utilities for paymentsto the Waste Fund provide that DOE will begin disposing of spent fuel orhigh-level waste by January 31, 1998.In little more than a year after enactment, the schedule established bythe NWPA began proving to be optimistic. In the reference schedule forthe repository presented in the April 1984 Draft Mission Plan, for example,DOE showed a slip from January 1989 to August 1993 for the decision onconstruction authorization.In the 1984 Waste Confidence Decision, the Commission recognized the possibilityof delay in respository availability beyond 1998, and did not define itstask as finding confidence that a repository would be available by the1998 milestone in the NWPA. The Commission focused instead on the questionof whether a repository would be available by the years 2007-2009, thedate cited in the court remand as the expiration of the OLs for the VermontYankee and Prairie Island reactors. The NRC believed that the NWPA increasedthe chances for repository availability within the first few years of thetwenty-first century, by specifying the means for resolving the institutionaland technical issues most likely to delay repository completion, by establishingthe process for compliance with NEPA, and by setting requirements for Federalagencies to cooperate with DOE in meeting program milestones. Finding thatno fundamental technical breakthroughs were necessary for the repositoryprogram, the Commission predicted that ``* * * selection and characterizationof suitable sites and construction of repositories will be accomplishedwithin the general time frame established by the Act [1998] or within afew years thereafter.''In January 1987, DOE issued a Draft Mission Plan Amendment to apprise Congressof significant developments and proposed changes in the repository program.In the Draft Amendment, DOE announced a five-year delay in its schedulefor repository availability from the first quarter of 1998 to the firstquarter of 2003. DOE's reasons for the delay included the need for moretime for consultation and interaction with States and Tribes, the requirementin DOE's 1987 budget the funds not be used for drilling exploratory shaftsin 1987, and the need for more information than previously planned forsite selection and the license application. The 1987 Draft Mission PlanAmendment set the second quarter of 1988 as the new date for exploratoryshaft construction at the Yucca Mountain Site. When the final 1987 MissionPlan Amendment was submitted to Congress in June 1987, the schedule forshaft sinking at the Yucca Mountain site had slipped six months to thefourth quarter of 1988. Congress did not take action to approve the June1987 Mission Plan Amendment as DOE had requested.On December 22, 1987, the NWPAA was enacted. The NWPAA has its major impacton the respository program in suspending site characterization activitiesat the Hanford and Deaf Smith County sites and authorizing DOE to characterizethe Yucca Mountain site for development of the first repository.DOE subsequently issued the Draft 1988 Mission Plan Amendment in June 1988,to appraise Congress of its plans for implementing the provisions of theNWPAA. In the Draft 1988 Mission Plan Amendment, DOE's schedule for shaftsinking at Yucca Mountain had slipped another six months to the secondquarter of 1989. At this writing, the schedule for shaft sinking is November1989, but NRC and DOE have agreed that DOE Must first have a qualifiedQA program in place. DOE efforts to date to qualify its QA program haverevealed issues requiring DOE attention before shaft excavation can begin,and it is possible that additional issues affecting DOE's readiness willcome to light.Realistically, as the date for shaft sinking slips, the date for repositoryoperation must be adjusted to reflect this slip. This might not be thecase if the original schedule had provided for periods of time betweencritical milestones that could absorb delays without affecting the schedulefor repository operation. This is not the case with the schedule for therepository. The repository schedule has always been aggressive and highlysuccess-oriented. In comments on the Draft 1988 Mission Plan Amendment,the Commission noted that the schedule has not allowed adequately for contingencies,and that, given the compression in the schedule for near-term program milestones,DOE has not shown how it will be able to meet the 2003 milestone for repositoryoperation.Another potential source of delay in repository availability may arisefrom NRC regulations. The Commission believes that current NRC rules arefully adequate to permit DOE to proceed to develop and submit a repositorylicense application, but further clarification of these rules is desirableto reduce the time needed to conduct the licensing proceeding itself. Inorder to meet the three-year schedule provided in the NWPA for a Commissiondecision on repository construction authorization, the NRC staff has undertakento refine its regulatory framework on a schedule that would still permitDOE to prepare and submit an application for repository construction authorizationunder its current schedule. The Commission fully expects to avoid delayingDOE's program, while working to reduce the uncertainties in NRC regulatoryrequirements that could become contentions in the licensing proceeding.Even if there are any delays resulting from a need for DOE to accommodatemore specific regulatory requirements in its site characterization or wastepackage development programs, however, the Commission is confident thatthe time savings in the licensing proceeding will more than compensatefor them.In view of the delays in exploratory shaft excavation since the 2003 datefor repository availability was set, it may be optimistic to expect thatPhase 1 of repository operations will be able to begin by 2203. As DOE'sschedule for repository availability as slipped a year and half since thedate was changed from 1998 to 2003, the earliest date for repository availabilitywould probably be closer to 2005.An institutional issue that may further affect DOE's schedule is the statusof EPA standards for disposal of spent fuel and high-level waste. Thesestandards are required under section 121(a) of the NWPA. Under 10 CFR 60.112,NRC's overall postclosure system performance objective, the geologic settingshall be selected and the engineered barrier system, which includes thewaste package, must be designed to assure that releases of radioactivematerials to the accessible environment, following permanent closure, conformto EPA's standards. 40 CFR part 191, the EPA standards, first became effectivein November 1985. In July 1987, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the FirstCircuit vacated and remanded to EPA for further proceedings subpart B ofthe high-level radioactive waste disposal standards. As noted under theaforementioned 1.A.1., the standards have not been reissued.A significant modification in the reissued EPA standard may affect theschedule for completing the design of the waste package and engineeredbarrier to the extent that design testing is planned to demonstrate compliancewith the standards. DOE's current site characterization plans for demonstratingcompliance with 40 CFR part 191 are based on the standards as promulgatedin 1985. DOE is proceeding to carry out its testing program developed forthe original EPA standards. DOE has stated that if the EPA standards arechanged significantly when they are reissued, DOE will reevaluate the adequacyof its testing program.The Commission believes that DOE's approach is reasonable. Much of theinformation required to demonstrate compliance with the EPA standards isexpected to remain the same regardless of the numerical level at whicheach standard is set. Considering the importance of developing the repositoryfor waste disposal as early as safely practicable, it would be inappropriatefor DOE to suspend work on development of engineered barriers pending reissuanceof the standards, unless EPA had given clear indications of major changesin them.Another possiblity is that, regardless of any changes in the repromulgatedEPA standards, they will be litigated in Federal court. Even if this provesto be the case, however, the Commission believes that any such litigationwill still permit EPA to promulgate final standards well within the timeneeded to enable DOE to begin repository operations at any site withinthe first quarter of the twenty-first century.Given the current pace of the DOE program, and assuming that the QA programcan be qualified and shaft excavation begun within the next year, the Commissionfinds it is still possible, though less likely, that a repository at YuccaMountain will be available by 2007-2009. To the extent that the expirationof the OLs for Prairie Island and Vermont Yankee continue to be relevantin this proceeding, the Commission believes it is more likely that a repositorywill be available by the anticipated dates of extension of the OLs forthose plants in 2012-2014. If DOE determines that the Yucca Mountain siteis unsuitable, the Commission considers it reasonble to expect that DOEcould make this determination by the year 2000 and have a repository atanother site available within the first quarter of the next century.<T3>2.B. Relevant Issues That Have Arisen Since the Commission's OriginalDecision </T3>2.B.1. NRC stated in 9-14-87 correspondence to Sen. Breaux on pending nuclearwaste legislation that under a program of single site characterization,``* * * there may be a greater potential for delay of ultimate operationof a repository than there is under the current regime where three siteswill undergo at-depth characterization before a site is selected.'' Towhat extent does the NWPAA raise uncertainty about the identification ofa technically acceptable site and potential delay in repository availabilityby limiting site characterization to a single candidate site (Yucca Mt.)and by raising the possibility that a negotiated agreement might influencerepository site selection? Does this uncertainty affect confidence in theavailibility of a respository by 2007-2009?In providing comments to Congress on proposed amendments to the NWPA, NRCtook the position that simultaneous site characterization of three sites,as required by the NWPA, was not necessary to protect public health andsafety. NRC further stated that the adequacy of a site for constructionauthorization would ultimately be determined in a licensing proceeding,and that NRC would only license a site that satisfied NRC licensing requirements.As described next, the Commission believes that the NWPAA contains numerousprovisions to ensure that a technically acceptable site will be identified.The NWPAA does not reduce the scope of site characterization activitiesthat DOE is authorized to undertake. The Amendments Act establishes a NuclearWaste Technical Review Board composed of individuals recommended by theNational Academy of Sciences and appointed by the President to evaluatethe scientific validity of DOE activities, including site characterizationactivities, and to report its findings at least semiannually to Congressand DOE. The Amendments Act also provides funding for technical assistanceto States, tribes, and affected units of local government. Finally, section160(1) of the NWPAA provides that ``Nothing in this Act shall be construedto amend or otherwise detract from the licensing requirements of the NRCestablished in Title II of the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974 (42 U.S.C.5841 <T3>et seq.</T3>).'' In providing for these reviews and in reaffirmingNRC's licensing authority, the NWPAA ensures that a candidate site fora repository must satisfy all NRC requirements and criteria for disposalof high-level radioactive wastes in licensed geologic repositories.Section 402 of the NWPAA establishes the Office of the Nuclear Waste Negotiator.The duty of the Negotiator is to attempt to find a State or tribe willingto host a repository or MRS at a technically qualified site. The Negotiatormay solicit comments from NRC, or any other Federal agency, on the suitabilityof any potential site for site characterization. Section 403(d)(4) strengthensthe Commission's confidence that a technically acceptable site will beidentified by providing that DOE may construct a repository at a negotiatedsite only if authorized by NRC. Given these safeguards on selection ofa technically acceptable site, the Commission does not consider that thepossibility of a negotiated agreement reduces the likelihood of findinga technically qualified site.The Commission raised the concern as early as April 1987 that under a programof single-site characterization, there could be considerable delay whilecharacterization was completed at another site or slate of sites if theinitially chosen site were found inadequate. By terminating site characterizationactivities at alternative sites to the Yucca Mountain site, the NWPAA hashad the effect of increasing the potential for delay in repository availabilityif the Yucca Mountain site proves unsuitable. The provision of the NWPAAfor a Negotiator could reduce the uncertainty and associated delay in restartingthe repository program by offering an alternate to the Yucca Mountain site;but at the time of this writing, a Negotiator has not been appointed.It should be noted here that the repository program redirection under theNWPAA does not, <T3>per se, </T3>have a significant impact on the Commission's assuranceof repository availability by 2007-2009. The Commission's reservationsabout reaffirming this timeframe derive from other considerations, includingdelays in sinking shafts and the potential for other delays in meetingprogram milestones, that would have arisen without the NWPAA.The Amendments Act does, however, effectively make it necessary that YuccaMountain be found suitable if the 2007-2009 timeframe is to be met; thistarget period would almost certainly be unachievable if DOE had to beginscreening to characterize and license another site. Thus, confidence isrepository availability by 2007-2009 implies confidence in the suitabilityof Yucca Mountain. The Commission does not want its findings here to constrainin any way its regulatory discretion in a licensing proceeding. The Commissionhas therefore concluded that even if the program were on schedule, it wouldbe inappropriate to reaffirm the 2007-2009 timeframe in the 1984 Decision.2.B.2. In the Draft 1988 Mission Plan Amendment, DOE stated that ``* ** the date indicate that the Yucca Mountain site has the potential capacityto accept at least 70,000 MTHM [metric tons heavy metal equivalent] ofwaste, but only after site characterization will it be possible to determinethe total quantity of waste that could be accommodated at the site.''a. Do the issues of limited spent fuel capacity at Yucca Mountain, indefinitesuspension of the second repository program, and the likelihood that nomore than one repository will be available by 2007-2009 undermine the NRC's1984 assurance that ``sufficient repository capacity will be availablewithin 30 years beyond expiration of any reactor operating license to disposeof existing commercial high level radioactive waste and spent fuel originatingin such reactor and generated up to that time?''b. Is there sufficient uncertainty in total spent fuel projections (e.g.,from extension-of-life license amendments, renewal of operating licensesfor an additional 20 to 30 years, or a new generation of reactor designs)that this Waste Confidence review should consider the institutional uncertaintiesarising from having to restart a second repository program?2.B.2.a. Although it will not be possible to determine whether Yucca Mountaincan accommodate 70,000 MTHM or more of spent fuel until after site characterization,the Commission does not believe that the question of repository capacityat the Yucca Mountain site should be a major factor in the analysis ofFinding 2. This is because it cannot be assumed that Yucca Mountain willultimately undergo development as a repository. The generic issue of repositorycapacity does add to the potential need for more than one repository, however.As noted earlier, the NWPA established deadlines for major milestones inthe development of the first and the second repository programs. The Actalso required NRC to issue a final decision on the construction authorizationapplication by January 1, 1989 for the first repository, and January 1,1992 for the second (or within three years of the date of submission ofthe applications, whichever occurred later). The July 1984 Draft DOE MissionPlan set January 1998 and October 2004 as the dates for commencement ofwaste emplacement in the first and second repositories, assuming that Congressionalauthorization was obtained to construct the second repository.Thus, at the time the 1984 Waste Confidence Decision was issued, DOE wasauthorized and directed to carry out two repository programs under a scheduleto make both facilities operational by 2007-2009. DOE and NRC were alsoworking under the constraint, still in force under the NWPA as amended,that no more than 70,000 MTHM may be emplaced in the first repository beforethe second is in operation. Because DOE estimated at the time that commercialU.S. nuclear power plants with operating licenses or construction permitswould discharge a total 160,000 MTHM of spent fuel, it appeared that atleast two repositories would be needed.In the 1984 Waste Confidence Decision, reactors were assumed to have a40-year operating lifetime, and because the earliest licenses were issuedin 1959 and the early 1960's, the oldest plants' licenses were due to expireas early as 1999 and 2000, as discussed in more detail below. Althoughit was expected that at least one repository would be available by thistime, there was also a limit as to how quickly spent fuel could be acceptedby the repository. DOE had estimated that waste acceptance rates of 3400MTHM per year could be achieved after the completion of Phase 2 of thefirst repository. This rate could essentially double if two repositorieswere in operation. At 6000 MTHM/year, it was estimated that all the anticipatedspent fuel could be emplaced in the two repositories by about the year2026. This was the basis for the Commission's position that sufficientrepository capacity would be available within 30 years beyond expirationof any reactor OL to dispose of existing commercial high level waste andspent fuel originating in such reactor and generated up to that time.In May 1986, however, DOE announced an indefinite postponement of the secondrepository program. The reasons for the postponement included decreasingforecasts of spent fuel discharges, as well as estimates that a secondrepository would not be needed as soon as originally supposed. With enactmentof the NWPAA in December 1987, DOE was required to terminate all site-specificactivities with respect to a second repository unless such activities werespecifically authorized and funded by Congress. The NWPAA required DOEto report to Congress on the need for a second repository on or after January1, 2007, but not later than January 1, 2010.Current DOE spent fuel projections, based on the assumption of no new reactororders, call for 87,000 MTHM to have been generated by the year 2036, includingapproximately 9000 MTHM of defense high-level waste. With the likelihoodthat there will be reactor lifetime extensions and renewals, however, theno-new-orders case probably underestimates total spent fuel discharges.Also, the NWPAA did not change the requirement that no more than 70,000MTHM could be emplaced in the first repository before operation of thesecond. It therefore appears likely that two repositories will be neededto dispose of all the spent fuel and high-level waste from the currentgeneration of reactors, unless Congress provides statutory relief fromthe 70,000 MTHM limit, and the first site has adequate capacity to holdall of the spent fuel and high-level waste generated. The Commission believesthat if the need for an additional repository is established, Congresswill provide the needed institutional support and funding, as it has forthe first repository.For all but a few licensed nuclear power reactors, OLs will not expireuntil some time in the first three decades of the twenty-first century.Several utilities are currently planning to have their OLs renewed forten to 30 years beyond the original license expiration. At these reactors,currently available spent fuel storage alternatives effectively removestorage capacity as a potential restriction for safe operations. For thesereasons, a repository is not needed by 2007-2009 to provide disposal capacitywithin 30 years beyond expiration of most OLs. If work is begun on thesecond repository program in 2010, the repository could be available by2035, according to DOE's estimate of 25 years for the time it will taketo carry out a program for the second repository. Two repositories availablein approximately 2025 and 2035, each with acceptance rates of 3400 MTHM/yearwithin several years after commencement of operations, would provide assurancethat sufficient repository capacity will be available within 30 years ofOL expiration for reactors to dispose of the spent fuel generated at theirsites up to that time.There are several reactors, however, whose OLs have already expired orare due to expire within the next few years, and which are now licensedor will be licensed only to possess their spent fuel. If a repository isnot available until about 2025, these reactors may be exceptions to thesecond part of the Commission's 1984 Finding 2, which was that sufficientrepository capacity will be available within 30 years beyond the expirationof any reactor OL to dispose of the commercial high-level waste and spentfuel originating in such reactor and generated up to that time.The basis for this second part of Finding 2 has two components: (1) A technicalor hardware component; and (2) an institutional component. The technicalcomponent relates to the reliability of storage hardware and engineeredstructures to provide for the safe storage of spent fuel. An example wouldbe the ability of spent fuel assemblies to withstand corrosion within spentfuel storage pools, or the ability of concrete structures to maintain theirintegrity over long periods. In the 1984 Decision, the Commission foundconfidence that available technology could in effect provide for safe storageof spent fuel for at least 70 years.The Commission's use of the expression ``30 years beyond expiration ofany reactor operating license'' in the 1984 Finding was based on the understandingthat the license expiration date referred to the scheduled expiration dateat the time the license was issued. It was also based on the understandingthat, in order to refuel the reactor, some spent fuel would be dischargedfrom the reactor within twelve to eighteen months after the start of fullpower operation.Thus, the Commission understood that, depending on the date of the firstreactor outage for refueling, some spent fuel would be stored at the reactorsite for most of the 40-year term of the typical OL. In finding that spentfuel could be safely stored at any site for at least 30 years after expirationof the OL for that reactor, the Commission indicated its expectation thatthe total duration of spent fuel storage at any reactor would be about70 years.Taking the earliest licensed power reactor, the Dresden 1 facility licensedin 1959, and adding the full 40-year operating license duration for a scheduledlicense expiration in the year 1999, the Commission's finding would thereforeentail removal of all spent fuel from that reactor to a repository withinthe succeeding 30 years, or by 2029. Even if a repository were not availableuntil the end of the first quarter of the twenty-first century, DOE wouldhave at least four years to ship the reactor's 683 spent fuel assemblies,totalling 70 metric tons initial heavy metal (MTIHM), from Dresden 1 withoutexceeding the Commission's 30-year estimate of the maximum time it wouldtake to dispose of the spent fuel generated in that reactor up to the timeits OL expired. (MTIMH is a measure of the mass of the uranium in the fuel(or uranium and plutonium if it is a mixed oxide fuel) at the time thefuel is placed in the reactor for irradiation.)Considering the experience from the 1984 and 1985 campaigns to return spentfuel from the defunct West Valley reprocessing facility to the reactorsof origin, 70 metric tons of BWR spent fuel can easily be shipped withinfour years. The first campaign, involving truck shipments of 20 metrictons from West Valley, NY, to Dresden 1 in Morris, IL, took eleven months.The second, involving truck shipments of 43 tons from West Valley to theOyster Creek reactor in Toms River, NJ, took six months. (See <T3>Case Histories of West Valley Spent Fuel Shipments</T3>, Final Report,NUREG/CR-4847 WPR-86(6811)-1, p. 2-2.) This estimate assumes, moreover,that no new transportation casks, designed to ship larger quantities ofolder, cooler spent fuel, for example, would be available by 2025.The institutional part of the question concerning the availability of sufficientrepository capacity required the Commission to make a finding as to whetherspent fuel in at-reactor storage would be safely maintained after the expirationof the facility OL. This question related to the financial and managerialcapability for continued safe storage and monitoring of spent fuel, ratherthan to the capability of the hardware involved. The Commission determined,in Finding 3 of its 1984 Decision, that spent fuel will be managed in asafe manner until sufficient repository capacity is available to assuresafe disposal, which was expected under Finding 2 to be about 30 yearsafter the expiration of any reactor OL. (See discussion of Finding 3 belowfor additional discussion of the institutional aspects of spent fuel storagepending the availability of sufficient disposal capacity.)The availability of a repository within the first quarter of the twenty-firstcentury holds no significant adverse implications for the Commission'sinstitutional concern that there be an organization with adequate willand wherewithal to provide continued long-term storage after reactor operation.This could be a concern if a significant number of reactors with significantquantities of spent fuel onsite were to discontinue operations indefinitelybetween now and 1995, and the utility-owners of these reactors did notappear to have the resources to manage them safely for up to 30 years pendingthe assumed availability of a repository in 2025.No such development is likely. No licenses for currently operating commercialnuclear reactors are scheduled to expire until the year 2000, and mostsuch licenses will expire during the first two decades after 2006. (See<T3>Nuclear Regulatory Commission 1989 Information Digest</T3>, NUREG-1350,Vol. 1, p. 33.) The availability of the first repository by 2025, and ofa second repository within one or two decades thereafter, would provideadequate disposal capacity for timely removal of the spent fuel generatedat these reactors.There are several licensees, however, whose authority to operate theircommercial reactors has already been terminated. These are Indian Point1, Dresden 1, Humboldt Bay, and Lacrosse. They are also the only licensedpower reactors that are retired with spent fuel being stored onsite. Assumingconservatively that a repository does not become operational until 2025,it appears likely that spent fuel will remain at these sites for more than30 years beyond the time their reactors were indefinitely shut down, atwhich point their operating licenses could be considered to have effectivelyexpired, although they will continue to hold a possession license for thestorage of the spent fuel. In considering the means and motivation of the owner of an indefinitelyretired reactor to provide safe long-term storage, the Commission believesit is useful to distinguish between the owner with only one reactor, andthe owner of a reactor at a multi-unit site or an owner with operatingreactors at other sites.In the case of a retired reactor at a multi-unit site, the owner wouldhave a clear need to maintain the safety of storage at the retired reactorsufficiently to permit continued generation at the site. If the owner ofthe retired reactor also owned other reactors at other sites, the spentfuel at the retired reactor could be transferred, if necessary, to thestorage facilities of other units still under active management. Of thefour reactors just cited, Indian Point 1 and Dresden 1 fit this description,and the sibling reactors at their sites are operating under licenses thatdo not expire until well beyond the year 2000_that is, well within thepost-OL period during which the Commission has found that spent fuel couldbe safely stored pending the availability of a repository. For the Lacrosse and Humboldt Bay reactors, the Commission is confidentthat, even if a repository is not available within 30 years following theirretirement, the overall safety and environmental acceptability of extendedspent fuel storage will also be maintained for these exceptional cases.Because there will still be an NRC possession license for the spent fuelat these facilities, the Commission will retain ample regulatory authorityto require any measures, such as removal of the spent fuel remaining instorage pools to passive dry storage casks, that might become necessaryuntil the time that DOE assumes title to the spent fuel under contractspursuant to the NWPA. It should also be borne in mind that Humboldt Bayand Lacrosse are both small early reactors, and their combined spent fuelinventory totals 67 metric tons of initial heavy metal. (See <T3>Spent Fuel Storage Requirements</T3> (DOE/RL 88-34) October 1988, TableA.3b., pp. A.15-A.17.) If for any reason not now foreseen, this spent fuelcan no longer be managed by the owners of these reactors, and DOE mustassume responsibility for its management earlier than currently planned,this quantity of spent fuel is well within the capability of DOE to manageonsite or offsite with available technology financed by the utility eitherdirectly or through the Nuclear Waste Fund. Nor does the Commission see a significant safety or environmental problemwith premature retirements of additional reactors. In the Commission'soriginal Waste Confidence Decision, it found reasonable assurance thatspent fuel would have to spend no more than 30 years in post-operationalstorage pending the availability of a repository. For a repository conservativelyassumed to be available in 2025, this expected 30-year maximum storageduration remains valid for most reactors, and would be true for all reactorsthat were prematurely retired after 1995. Based on the past history ofpremature shutdowns, the Commission has reason to believe that their likelyincidence during the next six years will be small as a proportion of totalreactor-years of operation. Historically, 14 of the 125 power reactors that have operated in the U.S.over the past 30 years have been retired before the expiration of theiroperating licenses. These early retirements included many low-power developmentalreactors, which may make the ratio of 14 to 125 disproportionately highas a basis for projecting future premature shutdowns. The Commission is aware of currently operating reactors that may be retiredbefore the expiration of their OLs, including: the recently-licensed Shorehamreactor, which has generated very little spent fuel; the Fort St. Vrainhigh-temperature gas-cooled reactor, which its owner plans to decommission;and the Rancho Seco reactor, which has operated for the past 12 years andmay or may not be retired. Assuming that all these and perhaps a few morereactors do retire in the next several years, their total spent fuel storagerequirements would not impose an unacceptable safety or environmental problem,even in the unlikely event that all these reactors' owners were renderedfinancially or otherwise unable to provide adequate care, and DOE wererequired to assume custody earlier than currently envisioned under theNWPA. Licensed non-power research reactors provide an even more manageable case.DOE owns the fuel for almost all of these reactors, many of which havebeen designed with lifetime cores that do not require periodic refueling.For those reactors that do discharge spent fuel, DOE accepts it for storageor reprocessing, and not more than an estimated 50 kilograms of such spentfuel are generated annually. Thus, given these worst-case projections, which are not expectations butbounding estimates, the Commission finds that a delay in repository availabilityto 2025 will not result in significant safety or environmental impactsdue to extended post-operational spent fuel storage. To put it anotherway, the Commission is confident that, even if a repository were not availablewithin 30 years after the effective expiration of the OLs for both currentlyretired reactors and potential future reactor retirements through 1995,the overall safety and environmental impacts of extended spent fuel storagewould be insignificant. 2.B.2.b. Although it is clear that there is uncertainty in projectionsof total future spent fuel discharges, it is not clear that the institutionaluncertainties arising from having to restart a second repository programshould be considered in detail in the current Waste Confidence Decisionreview. License renewals would have the effect of increasing requirements for spentfuel storage. The Commission understands that some utilities are currentlyplanning to seek renewals for 30 years. Assuming for the sake of establishinga conservative upper bound that the Commission does grant 30-year licenserenewals, the total operating life of some reactors would be 70 years,so that the spent fuel initially generated in them would have to be storedfor about 100 years if a repository were not available until 30 years afterthe expiration of their last OLs.Even under the conservative bounding assumption of 30-year license renewalsfor all reactors, however, if a repository were available within the firstquarter of the twenty-first century, the oldest spent fuel could be shippedoff the sites of all currently operating reactors well before the spentfuel initially generated in them reached the age of 100 years. Thus, asecond repository, or additional capacity at the first, would be neededonly to accommodate the additional quantity of spent fuel generated duringthe later years of these reactors' operating lives. The availability ofa second repository would permit spent fuel to be shipped offsite wellwithin 30 years after expiration of these reactors' OLs. The same wouldbe true of the spent fuel discharged from any new generation of reactordesigns.In sum, although some uncertainty in total spent fuel projections doesarise from such developments as utilities' planning renewal of OLs foran additional 20 to 30 years, the Commission believes that this Waste Confidencereview need not at this time consider the institutional uncertainties arisingfrom having to restart a second repository program. Even if work on thesecond repository program is not begun until 2010 as contemplated undercurrent law, there is sufficient assurance that a second repository willbe available in a timeframe that would not constrain the removal of spentfuel from any reactor within 30 years of its licensed life for operation.2.B.3. Are early slippages in the DOE repository program milestones significantenough to affect the Commission's confidence that a repository will beavailable when needed for health and safety reasons?The 2007-2009 timeframe imposed on the Commission by the May 23, 1979 remandby the Court of Appeals was based on the scheduled expiration of the OLsfor the Vermont Yankee and Prairie Island nuclear reactors. The specificissues remanded to the Commission were: (1) Whether there is reasonableassurance that an offsite storage solution will be available by the years2007-2009 (the expiration of the plants' operating licenses); and, if not,(2) whether there is reasonable assurance that the fuel can be stored safelyat the sites beyond those dates.There was no finding by the Court that public health and safety requiredoffsite storage or disposal by 2007-2009. In directing the Commission toaddress the safety of at-reactor storage beyond 2007-2009, the Court recognizedthe possibility that an offsite storage or disposal facility might notbe available by then. In any case, the years 2007-2009 no longer have thesame meaning for this proceeding as they had in 1984; the OLs for PrairieIsland and Vermont Yankee have been or will soon be extended to 2012-2014,on the basis of NRC's past willingness to approve a 40-year operating lifetimefrom the date of issuance of the OL.The Commission has not identified a date by which a repository must beavailable for health and safety reasons. Taking into account institutionalrequirements for spent fuel storage, the Commission found, under Finding3 in the 1984 Waste Confidence Decision, that spent fuel would be safelymanaged until sufficient repository capacity is available. The Commissionalso found, however, that in effect, under the second part of Finding 2,safe management would not need to continue for more than 30 years beyondexpiration of any reactor's OL, because sufficient repository capacitywas expected to become available within those 30 years. Considering thatspent fuel would not have to be stored more than 30 years after any reactor's40-year OL expiration, and taking into account the technical requirementsfor such storage, the Commission went on to determine under Finding 4 that,in effect, spent fuel could be safely stored for at least 70 years afterdischarge from a reactor. Thus, the Commission's 1984 Decision did notestablish a time when sufficient repository capacity would be required;it established a minimum period during which storage would continue tobe safe and environmentally acceptable pending the expected availabilityof sufficient repository capacity.Bearing in mind that reactor facilities were originally designed and OLsissued for a licensed life for operation of 40 years, the Commission isproposing elsewhere in this <T4>Federal Register</T4> notice a clarifying revision of Finding 4 tosay that spent fuel can be safely stored at a reactor for at least 30 yearsafter the ``licensed life for operation'' of that reactor. Implicitly,the proposed use of the phrase ``licensed life for operation'' clarifiesthat the Commission found in 1984 that NRC licensing requirements for reactorfacility design, construction, and operation provide reasonable assurancethat spent fuel can be stored safely and without significant environmentalimpacts for at least the first 40 years of the reactor's life. The Commission'sproposed finding also implies that, barring any significant and pertinentunexpected developments, neither technical nor institutional constraintswould adversely affect this assurance for at least another 30 years afterthat first 40 years. Another implication of this revised finding is that,where a utility is able to meet NRC requirements to extend that reactor'soperating lifetime by license renewal, spent fuel storage for at least30 years beyond the end of the period of extended life will also be safeand without significant environmental impacts.In assessing the effect of early slippages in DOE repository program milestones,therefore, the most important consideration is not the earliest date thatan operating license actually expired, but the earliest date that an OLwas issued. The earliest OL to be issued was for Dresden 1 in 1959, followedby a number of reactors licensed for operation in 1962. The OLs for allof the 111 power reactors now licensed to operate are currently scheduledto expire sometime within the first three decades of the twenty-first century,which is also the period in which their currently licensed life for operationwould end. (See <T3>Nuclear Regulatory Commission 1989 Information Digest, </T3>NUREG-1350,Vol. 1, p. 33.) Thus, conservatively assuming here that there will be nolicense renewals, the earliest timeframe when a repository might be neededto dispose of spent fuel from the majority of reactors is 2029-2050.As proposed in the first part of Finding 2, the Commission has reasonableassurance that a repository will be available within the first quarterof the twenty-first century. Even if a repository were not available until2025, this would be several years before the beginning of the earliesttimeframe within which, based on an assumed 30-year storage after an assumed40-year licensed life of reactor operation, a repository might be neededfor spent fuel disposal. Thus, early slippages in DOE's program milestonesdo not affect the Commission's confidence that a repository will be availablewithin that timeframe.2.B.4. NRC has stated that the 3- to 4-year license application reviewschedule is optimistic, and that for NRC to meet this schedule, DOE mustsubmit a complete and high-quality license application. In the September16, 1988 NRC comments to DOE on the Draft 1988 Mission Plan Amendment,the Commission requested that DOE acknowledge its commitment to developthis complete and high-quality application, ``even if this would resultin longer times to collect the necessary information and subsequent delaysin submitting the license application.''Will NRC's emphasis on the completeness and quality of the license applicationhave a significant effect on the timing of the submittal of the licenseapplication and subsequent licensing proceeding to grant construction authorizationin time for repository availability by 2007-2009?As the NRC indicated to DOE in NRC's October 25, 1985 comments on the draftPDS, the three-year statutory schedule for the NRC licensing proceedingon the application for construction authorization is optimistic. The Commissionhas sought ways to improve the prospects for meeting this schedule, forexample by developing the LSS for expedited document discovery during thelicensing proceeding.In the same correspondence on the PDS, NRC also stated that the adequacyof the three-year review period depends on DOE's submittal of a completeand high-quality application. A license application supported by inadequatedata may lead to findings during the licensing proceeding that the resultsof certain tests cannot be admitted as part of the license application.If it is not possible to repeat the tests in question, NRC may have noalternative but to deny the application_with a consequent loss of programmomentum and considerable financial cost.NRC recognizes that emphasis on a complete and high-quality license applicationmay cause some near-term delays that could make it difficult to achievethe current schedule calling for submittal of the construction authorizationapplication in 1995. Notwithstanding any such delays, the Commission hasreasonable assurance that if the Yucca Mountain site is not found unsuitable,a repository at that site could be available by the 2012-2014 timeframe,consistent with the rescheduled OL expiration dates for Prairie Islandand Vermont Yankee. For reasons discussed previously, this timeframe nowappears more relevant to the Waste Confidence proceeding than the 2007-2009timeframe.In any case, the Commission remains convinced that the benefits to therepository program of submitting a high-quality license application wouldoutweigh the cost of delay in preparing the application. NRC has alwaysplaced great emphasis on early resolution of potential licensing issuesin the interest of expeditious review of the license application and timelyrepository availability. It is in the same spriit of timely repositoryoperation that the Commission is urging greater attention to quality thanto meeting the schedule for submittal of the license application. NRC believesthat a complete and high-quality license application offers the best availableassurance that timely repository licensing and operation can be achieved.In addition to expediting the review of the application, a high-qualitylicense application and site characterization program should enhance overallconfidence that any site granted a construction authorization will proveto be reliable during the period of performance confirmation. It will alsoincrease public confidence that the program is being carried out in a thoroughand technically sound manner.2.C. Conclusion on Finding 2In reexamining the technical and institutional uncertainties surroundingthe timely development of a geologic repository since the 1984 Waste ConfidenceDecision, the Commission has been led to question the conservatism of itsexpectation that a repository would be available to 2007-2009.At the time of the 1984 Decision, the Commission said that timely attainmentof a repository did not require DOE to adhere strictly to the milestonesset out in the NWPA, and there would be delays in some milestones. It didnot appear to the Commission at the time that delays of a year or so inmeeting any of the milestones would delay the date of repository availabilityby more than a few years beyond the 1998 deadline specified in the act.Since then, however, several developments have made it apparent that delaysof more than a few years are to be the norm rather than the exception inthe early years of this program. There has been a five-year slip in DOE'sestimate of repository availability from 1998 to 2003, and DOE has beenunable to meet such near-term repository program milestones as excavationof the exploratory shaft and the start of in-situ testing. There remainsthe possibility that potential repository availability at the Yucca Mountainsite wil be further delayed due to unforeseen problems during site characterization.These developments do not in themselves rule out the possibility that DOEwill still be able to achieve repository operation by 2007-2009, but theydo suggest that to expect repository operation by then may be optimistic.In the Commission's view, 2012-2014 is now a more relevant timeframe than2007-2009. When the Court issued its 1979 remand, 2007-2009 was when theOLs for Vermont Yankee and Prairier Island were scheduled to expire. Theoperating licenses for the two Prairie Island units have since been extendedto 2013 and 2014, and the operating license for Vermont Yankee is eligiblefor extension to 2012. These extensions have been made available underthe Commission's policy that the allowable operating life of a licensedreactor should not be foreshortened because of construction delays. Ittherefore seems reasonable for NRC to make its finding on the timing ofrepository availability by 2012-2014, rather than by 2007-2009. The Commissionhas a greater degree of assurance that if the Yucca Mountain site is suitable,a repository would be available there by 2012-2014.For the sake of conservatism, however, the suitability of Yucca Mountainshould not be assumed. Yucca Mountain is now the only candidate site available;the NWPAA required that DOE terminate site characterization activitiesat all sites other than the Yucca Mountain site. In effect, the 2007-09schedule for repository availability could be met only if Yucca Mountainsurvived the repository development process as a licensed site. If thissite were found to be unlicenseable or otherwise unsuitable, characterizationwould have to begin at another site or suite of sites, with consequentfurther delay in repository availability. The final decision on the suitabilityof the site to proceed to licensing and repository development will restwith DOE, but the position of the NRC staff will figure in that decision.The staff will not be able to make a recommendation to a licensing boardto authorize repository construction at Yucca Mountain until all site characterizationactivities have been completed. DOE might thus be able for several moreyears to determine whether there will in fact have to be a delay to findand characterize another site.Another reason the Commission is unwilling to assume the suitability ofYucca Mountain is that NRC must be mindful of preserving all its regulatoryoptions_including a recommendation of license application denial_to assureadequate protection of public health and safety from radiological risk.In our view, it is essential to dispel the notion that for schedular reasonsthere is no alternative to the currently preferred site. This view is consistentwith past Commission statements that the quality of DOE's preparationsfor a license application should take precedence over timeliness wherethe two conflict. It is also consistent with the view that because we aremaking predictions about completion dates for a unique and complex enterpriseat least some 20 years hence, it is more reasonable to express the timescalefor completion in decades rather than years.In order to obtain a conservative upper bound for the timing of repositoryavailability, the Commission has made the assumption that the Yucca Mountainsite will be found to be unsuitable. If DOE were authorized to initiatesite screening for a repository at a different site in the year 2000, theCommission believes it is reasonable to expect that a repository wouldbe available by the year 2025. This estimate is based on the DOE positionthat site screening for a second repository should begin 25 years beforethe start of waste acceptance. The consideration of technical and institutionalissues presented here has found none that would preclude the availabilityof a repository within this timeframe.For the second part of its 1984 finding on repository availability, theCommission found reasonable assurance that sufficient repository capacitywill be available within 30 years beond expiration of any reactor OL todispose of existing commercial high level waste and spent fuel originatingin that reactor and generated up to that time. The Commission believesthat this finding should also be modified in light of developments since1984.When the Commission made this finding, it took into consideration bothtechnical and institutional concerns. The technical concern centered onthe ability of the spent fuel and the engineered at-reactor storage facilitiesto meet the requirements for extended post-operational storage before shipmentfor disposal. The institutional question concerned whether the utilitycurrently responsible for post-operational at-reactor storage, or somesubstitute organization, would be able to assure the continued safety ofthis storage.The principal new developments since 1984 that bear on these questionsare: (1) That dry spent fuel storage technologies have become operationalon a commercial scale; and (2) that several utilities are proceeding withplans to seek renewals of their OLs, with appropriate plant upgrading,for an additional period up to 30 years beyond the 40-year term of theircurrent licenses. The accumulation of operating experience with dry-caskstorage, a technology requiring little active long-term maintenance, providesadditional assurance that both the technical and institutional requirementsfor extended post-operational spent fuel storage will be met. License renewals,however, would have the effect of increasing requirements for both thequantity and possibly the duration of storage. If the commission were togrant 30-year license renewals, the total operating life of some reactorscould be 70 years, so that the spent fuel initially generated in such reactorswould have to be stored for about 100 years, if a respository were notavailable until 30 years after the expiration of their last OLs. This raisesthe question as to whether that spent fuel, and the hardware and civilengineering structures for storing it, can continue to meet NRC requirementsfor an additional 30 years beyond the period the Commission supported in1984.For all the reasons cited in the discussion of Finding 4, the Commissionbelieves there is ample technical basis for confidence that spent fuelcan be stored safely and without significant environmental impact at thesereactors for at least 100 years. If a repository were available withinthe first quarter of the twenty-first century, the oldest spent fuel couldbe shipped off the sites of all currently operating reactors well beforethe spent fuel initially generated in them reached the age of 100 years.The need to consider the institutional aspects of storage beyond 30 yearsafter OL expiration was not in evidence in 1984 because the Commissionwas confident that at least one repository would be available by 2007-2009.On that schedule, waste acceptance of spent fuel from the first reactorwhose operating license had expired (Indian Point 1, terminated in 1980)could have begun within 30 years of expiration of that license. If a repositorydoes not prove to be available until 2025, however, it would not be availablewithin 30 years of the time that OLs could be considered effectively tohave expired for Indian Point 1 and the three other plants with spent fuelonsite that were retired before the end of their licensed life for reactoroperation. The same would be true of any additional reactors prematurelyretired between now and 1995, when the 30-year clock starts for the availabilityof a repository by 2025. Premature shutdowns notwithstanding, the Commissionhas reasons to be assured that the spent fuel at all of these reactorswill be stored safely and without significant environmental impact untilsufficient repository capacity becomes available. Considering first the technical reasons for this assurance, it is importantto recognize that each of these reactors and its spent fuel storage installationwere originally licensed in part on the strength of the applicant's showingthat the systems and components of concern were designed and built to assuresafe operation for 40 years under expected normal and transient severeconditions. All of the currently retired reactors have a significant portionof that 40-year expected life remaining, and all have only small quantitiesof spent fuel onsite in storage installations that were licensed to withstandconsiderably larger thermal and radiation loadings from much greater quantitiesof spent fuel. Of the four reactors currently retired with spent fuel onsite,the two with far the longest terms of operation, Lacrosse and Dresden,were operated for 19 and 18 years, respectively. For the continued safe management of the spent fuel and storage installationsat any existing or potential prematurely retired plant, the Commissionbelieves it can reasonably rely on the continued structural and functionalintegrity of the plant's engineered storage installations for at leastthe balance of its originally licensed life as if the OL were still ineffect. This is to say that for the purposes of Finding 2, no foreseeabletechnical constraints have arisen to disturb the Commission's assurancethat spent fuel storage at any reactor will remain safe and environmentallyaccpetable for at least 30 years after its licensed life for operation,regardless of whether its OL has been terminated at an earlier date. The Commission also sees no insurmountable institutional obstacles to thecontinued safe management of spent fuel during the remainder of any shutdownreactor's initially licensed life for operation, or for at least 30 yearsthereafter. Because there will still be an NRC possession license for thespent fuel at any reactor that has indefinitely suspended operations, theCommission will retain ample regulatory authority to require any measures,such as removal of the spent fuel remaining in storage pools to passivedry storage casks, that might appear necessary after an OL expires. Evenif a licensed utility were to become insolvent, and responsibility forspent fuel management were transferred to DOE earlier than is currentlyplanned, the Commission has no reason to believe that DOE would have insufficientNuclear Waste Fund resources or otherwise be unable to carry out any safety-relatedmeasures NRC considers necessary. Thus, in the case of a premature reactorretirement, the Commission has an adequate basis, on both technical andinstitutional grounds, for reasonable assurance that spent fuel can bestored safely and without significant environmental impacts for at least30 years beyond not only the actual end of that reactor's OL, but the endof its originally licensed life for operation. In sum, considering developments since 1984 in the repository developmentprogram, in the operating performance of U.S. power reactors, and in spentfuel storage technology, the Commission finds that: (1) The overall publichealth, safety, and environmental impacts of the possible unavailabilityof a repository by 2007-2009 would be insignificant; and (2) neither 30-yearrenewals of reactor licenses nor a delay in repository availablility to2025 will result in significant safety or environmental impacts from extendedpost-operational spent fuel storage. The Commission finds ample grounds for its proposed revised findings onthe expected availability of a repository. The institutional support forthe repository program is well-established. A mechanism for funding repositoryprogram activities is in place, and there is a provision in the NWPA foradjusting, if necessary, the fee paid by utilities into this fund. Congresshas continued to provide support for the repository program in settingmilestones, delineating responsibilities, establishing advisory bodies,and providing a mechanism for dealing with the concerns of States and affectedIndian tribes. Technical support for extended spent fuel storage has improved since 1984.Considering the growing availability, reasonable cost, and accumulatedoperating experience with new dry cask spent fuel storage technology sincethen, the Commission now has even greater assurance that spent fuel canbe stored safely and without significant environmental impact for at least30 years after the expected expiration of any reactor's OL. Where a reactor'sOL has been terminated before the expected expiration date, the Commissionhas an adequate basis to reaffirm what was implicit in its initial concept,namely: that regardless of the actual date when the reactor's operatingauthority effectively ended, spent fuel can be stored safely and withoutsignificant environmental impacts for at least 30 years beyond that reactor'slicensed life for operation. There is thus no foreseeable health and safety or environmental requirementthat a repository be made available within the 2007-2009 timeframe at issuein the Commission's original proceeding. Nor does the Commission see aradiological safety or environmental requirement for repository availabilityat the end of the expected revised timeframe of 2012-2014 for the expirationof the Prairie Island and Vermont Yankee OLs. Indeed, the Commission sees important NRC mission-related grounds for avoidingany statement that repository operation by 2007-2009 is required. Geologicdisposal of high-level radioactive wastes is an unprecedented endeavor.It requires reliable projections of the waste isolation performance ofnatural and engineered barriers over millennia. After the repository issealed, retrieval of the emplaced wastes will no longer be practicable,and the commitment of wastes to that site will, by design, be irreversible.In DOE's testing, both in the laboratory and at the candidate repositorysite, in its development of facility and waste-package designs, and inall other work to demonstrate that NRC requirements will be met for a repositoryat Yucca Mountain, the Commission believes that the confidence of bothNRC and the public depends less on meeting the schedule for repositoryoperation than on meeting safety requirements and doing the job right thefirst time. Thus, given the Commission's assurance that spent fuel cansafely be stored for at least 100 years if necessary, it appears prudentfor all concerned to prepare for the better-understood and more manageableproblems of storage for a few more years in order to provide additionaltime to assure the success of permanent geologic disposal. This is not to say that the Commission is unsympathetic to the need fortimely progress toward an operational repository. It is precisely becauseNRC is so confident of the national commitment to achieve early repositoryoperation that the Commission believes it no longer need add its weightto the considerable pressures already bearing on the DOE program. Thereis ample institutional impetus on the part of others, including Congress,the nuclear power industry, State utility rate regulatory bodies, and consumersof nuclear-generated power, toward DOE achievement of scheduled programmilestones. With continuing confidence in the technical feasibility ofgeologic disposal, the Commission has no reason to doubt the institutionalcommitment to achieve it in a timeframe well before it might become necessaryfor safety or environmental reasons. Indeed, the Commission believes itadvisable not to attempt in this review a more precise NRC estimate ofthe point at which a repository will be needed for radiological safetyor environmental reasons, lest this estimate itself undermine the commitmentto earlier achievement of repository operations. The Commission continuesto hope that a repository will in fact be available by 2007-2009, and hasfound nothing to date that would conclusively prevent this achievement.To find reasonable assurance that a repository will be available by 2007-2009,however, is a different and more consequential proposition in the contextof this review. In light of the delays the program has encountered sinceits inception, and the regulatory need to avoid a premature commitmentto the Yucca Mountain site, the Commission cannot prudently describe abasis for assurance that the current DOE schedule for repository operationin 2003 will not slip another four to six years under any reasonably foreseeablecircumstances. The Commission could more easily substantiate a findingthat a repository will be available within the revised 2012-2014 timeframethat would be created by extending the OLs of the reactors in questionwhen the Waste Confidence proceeding began. Even this revised estimate,however, could too easily be misinterpreted as an NRC estimate of the timeat which continued spent fuel storage at these sites would be unsafe orenvironmentally significant. The Commission's enhanced confidence in thesafety of extended spent fuel storage provides adequate grounds for theview that NRC need not at this time define more precisely the period when,for reasons related to NRC's mission, a permanent alternative to post-operationalspent fuel storages will be needed. The Commission therefore proposes thefollowing revision of its original Finding on when sufficient repositorycapacity will be available. <ITAG tagnum="21">The Commission finds reasonable assurance that at least one minedgeologic repository will be available within the first quarter of the twenty-firstcentury, and sufficient repository capacity will be available within 30years beyond the licensed life for operation of any reactor to disposeof the commercial high-level radioactive waste and spent fuel originatingin such reactor and generated up to that time. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">Original Finding 3</ITAG>The Commission finds reasonable assurance that high-level radioactive wasteand spent fuel will be managed, in a safe manner until sufficient repositorycapacity is available to assure the safe disposal of all high-level wasteand spent fuel.<ITAG tagnum="84">Proposed Finding 3</ITAG>Same as above.3.A. Issues Considered in Commission's 1984 Decision on Finding 3In the Commission's discussion of Finding 3 in its Waste Confidence Decision(49 FR 34658, August 31, 1984), in section 2.3 `Third Commission Finding,'the Commission stated.<ITAG tagnum="21">Nuclear power plants whose operating licenses expire after the years2007-09 will be subject to NRC regulation during the entire period betweentheir initial operation and the availability of a waste repository. TheCommission has reasonable assurance that the spent fuel generated by theselicensed plants will be managed by the licensees in a safe manner. Compliancewith the NRC regulations and any specific license conditions that may beimposed on the licensees will assure adequate protection of the publichealth and safety. Regulations primarily addressing spent fuel storageinclude 10 CFR part 50 for storage at the reactor facility and 10 CFR part72 for storage in independent spent fuel storage installations (ISFSIs).Safety and environmental issues involving such storage are addressed inlicensing reviews under both parts 50 and 72, and continued storage operationsare audited and inspected by NRC. NRC's experience in more than 80 individualevaluations of the safety of spent fuel storage shows that significantreleases of radioactivity from spent fuel under licensed storage conditionsare extremely remote.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Some nuclear power plant operating licenses expire before the years2007-09. For technical, economic or other reasons, other plants may choose,or be forced to terminate operation prior to 2007-09 even though theiroperating licenses have not expired. For example, the existence of a safetyproblem for a particular plant could prevent further operation of the plantor could require plant modifications that make continued plant operationuneconomic. The licensee, upon expiration or termination of its license,may be granted (under 10 CFR part 50 or part 72) a license to retain custodyof the spent fuel for a specified term (until repository capacity is availableand the spent fuel can be transferred to DOE under sec. 123 of the NuclearWaste Policy Act of 1982) subject to NRC regulations and license conditionsneeded to assure adequate protection of the public. Alternatively, theowner of the spent fuel, as a last resort, may apply for an interim storagecontract with DOE, under sec. 135(b) of the Act, until not later than 3years after a repository or monitored retrievable storage facility is availablefor spent fuel. For the reasons discussed above, the Commission is confidentthat in every case the spent fuel generated by those plants will be managedsafely during the period between license expiration or termination andthe availability of a mined waste repository for disposal.</ITAG>Even if a repository does not become available until 2025, nothing hasoccurred during the five years since its original Decision to diminishthe Commission's confidence that high-level waste and spent fuel will bemanaged in a safe manner until a repository is available. The same logicjust stated continues to apply through the first quarter of the twenty-firstcentury. NRC regulations remain adequate to assure safe storage of spentfuel and radioactive high-level waste at reactors, at independent spentfuel storage installations (ISFSIs), and in an MRS until sufficient repositorycapacity is available.10 CFR 72.42(a) provides for renewal of licensed storage at ISFSIs foradditional 20-year periods for interim storage, or for additional 40-yearperiods for monitored retrievable storage of spent fuel and solidifiedradioactive high-level waste if an MRS facility is constructed, licensed,and operated. This would ensure that spent fuel and solidified high-levelwaste, if any were to be delivered to an MRS facility, would remain insafe storage under NRC regulation throughout its storage. The Commissionhas also published for public comment a proposed amendment to part 72,to issue a general license to reactor operating licensees to use approvedspent fuel storage casks at reactor sites. If this proposed amendment ispromulgated, no specific part 72 license would be required. Operating licenseholders would register with NRC to use approved casks on their sites.Spent fuel may continue to be stored in the reactor spent fuel pool undera part 50 ``possession only'' license after the reactor has ceased operating.In addition, DOE's policy of disposing of the oldest fuel first, as setforth in its Annual Capacity Report, makes it unlikely that any significantfraction of total spent fuel generated will be stored for longer than the30 years beyond the expiration of any operating reactor license. This expectation,established in the Commission's original proceeding, continues to be reasonable,even in the event that a repository is not available until some time duringthe first quarter of the twenty-first century. Even in the case of prematureshutdowns, where spent fuel is most likely to remain at a site for 30 yearsor longer beyond OL expiration (see Finding 2, previously discussed), theCommission has confidence that spent fuel will be safely managed untilsafe disposal is available.Until the reactor site has been fully decommissioned, and spent fuel hasbeen transferred from the utility to DOE as required by NRC regulations,the licensee remains responsible to NRC. Furthermore, under 10 CFR 50.54bb,originally issued in final form by the Commission with its 1984 Waste ConfidenceDecision, a reactor licensee must provide to NRC, five years before expirationof an OL, notice of plans for spent fuel disposition. Accordingly, theCommission concludes that nothing has changed since the enactment of theNuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 and the Waste Confidence Decision in August1984 to diminish the Commission's ``* * * reasonable assurance that high-levelradioactive waste and spent fuel will be managed in a safe manner untilsufficient repository capacity is available * * *.''Pursuant to the NWPA, the Commission issued in final form 10 CFR part 53,``Criteria and Procedures for Determining Adequacy of Available Spent NuclearFuel Storage Capacity,'' addressing the determination of need, if any,for DOE interim storage. No applications were received by the June 30,1989 NWPA deadline incorporated into the Commission's rule, and it seemsunlikely that any applications will be made to NRC for interim storageby DOE. Even if NRC were to make an exception for a late application, adetermination must be made before January 1, 1990 to comply with the NWPA.3.B Relevant Issues That Have Arisen Since the Commission's Original Decisionon Finding 3Although a DOE facility will not be available to enable the Departmentto begin accepting spent fuel in 1998, as provided in the contracts underthe NWPA, the Commission's confidence in safe storage is unaffected byany potential contractual dispute between DOE and spent fuel generatorsand owners as to responsibility for spent fuel storage. In the event thatDOE does not take title to spent fuel by this date, a licensee under either10 CFR part 50 or part 72 cannot abandon spent fuel in its possession.Further, the Commission notes that only two reactors are currently scheduledfor shutdown before 2003, DOE's anticipated repository startup date. (See<T3>Nuclear Regulatory Commission 1989 Information Digest, </T3>NUREG-1350,Vol. 1, p.33). To resolve any continuing uncertainties, however, it wouldbe helpful if DOE and utilities and other spent fuel generators and ownerscould reach an early and amicable resolution to the question of how andwhen DOE will accept responsibility for spent fuel. This would facilitatecooperative action to provide for a smoothly operating system for the ultimatedisposition of spent fuel.The Commission recognizes that the NWPA limitation of 70,000 NTHM for thefirst repository will not provide adequate capacity for the total amountof spent fuel projected to be generated by all currently operating licensedreactors. The NWPAA effectively places a moratorium on a second repositoryprogram until 2007-2010. Either the first repository must be authorizedand able to provide expanded capacity sufficient to accommodate the spentfuel generated, or there must be more than one repository. Since Congressspecifically provided in the NWPAA for a first repository, and requiredDOE to return for legislative authorization for a second repository, theCommission believes that Congress will continue to provide institutionalsupport for adequate repository capacity.The Commission's confidence about the availability of repository capacityis not affected by the possibility that some existing reactor licensesmight be renewed to permit continued generation of spent fuel at thesesites. Because only two reactor licenses are scheduled to expire before2003, the impact of license renewals (a matter not considered in the Commission's1984 Decision) will have no significant effect within the first quarterof the twenty-first century on scheduling requirements for a second repository.Renewals may slightly alleviate the need for a second repository in theshort term, because spent fuel storage capacity will be expanded for extendedstorage at these reactor sites. Over the longer term, renewals might increasespent fuel generation well into the latter half of the twenty-first century.Nonetheless, nothing in this situation diminishes the Commission's assurancethat safe storage will be made available as needed.In summary, the Commission finds no basis for changing the Third Findingin its Waste Confidence Decision. The Commission continues to find ``** * reasonable assurance that high-level radioactive waste and spent fuelwill be managed in a safe manner until sufficient repository capacity isavailable to assure the safe disposal of all high-level waste and spentfuel.''<ITAG tagnum="84">Original Finding 4</ITAG>The Commission finds reasonable assurance that, if necessary, spent fuelgenerated in any reactor can be stored safely and without significant environmentalimpacts for at least 30 years beyond the expiration of that reactor's operatinglicense at that reactor's spent fuel storage basin, or at either onsiteor offsite independent spent fuel storage installations.<ITAG tagnum="84">Proposed Finding 4</ITAG>The Commission finds reasonable assurance that, if necessary, spent fuelgenerated in any reactor can be stored safely and without significant environmentalimpact for at lest 30 years beyond the licensed lite for operation (whichmay include the term of a revised license) of that reactor at its spentfuel storage basin, or at either onsite or offsite independent spent fuelstorage installations.4.A. Issues Considered in Commission's 1984 Decision on Finding 4In the Commission's discussion of Finding 4 in its Waste Confidence Decision(49 FR 34658, August 31, 1984) section 2.4 ``Fourth Commission Finding,''the Commission said that:<ITAG tagnum="21">Although the Commission has reasonable assurance that at least onemined geologic repository will be available by the years 2007-09, the Commissionalso realizes that for various reasons, including insufficient capacityto immediately dispose of all existing spent fuel, spent fuel may be storedin existing or new storage facilities for some periods beyond 2007-09.The Commission believes that this extended storage will not be necessaryfor any period longer than 30 years beyond the term of an operating license.For this reason, the Commission has addressed on a generic basis in thisdecision the safety and environmental impacts of extended spent fuel storageat reactor spent fuel basins or at either onsite or offsite spent fuelstorage installations. The Commission finds that spent fuel can be storedsafely and without significant environmental impacts for at least 30 yearsbeyond the expiration of reactor operating licenses. To ensure that spentfuel which remains in storage will be managed properly until transferredto DOE for disposal, the Commission is proposing an amendment to its regulations(10 CFR part 50). The amendment will require the licensee to notify theCommission, five years prior to expiration of its reactor operating license,how the spent fuel will be managed until disposal.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The Commission's finding is based on the record of this proceedingwhich indicates that significant releases of radioactivity from spent fuelunder licensed storage conditions are highly unlikely. It is also supportedby the Commission's experience in conducting more than 80 individual safetyevaluations of storage facilities.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The safety of prolonged spent fuel storage can be considered in termsof four major issues: (a) The long-term integrity of spent fuel under waterpool storage conditions, (b) structure and component safety for extendedfacility operation, (c) the safety of dry storage, and (d) potential risksof accidents and acts of sabotage at spent fuel storage facilities.</ITAG>For reasons discussed above, the Commission arrived at a provisional figureof 10 years or more for storage (i.e., a 40-year reactor 0L span, plus30 years or more).The 70-year-plus estimate is supported by oral testimony from the nuclearindustry to the Commission in the Waste Confidence Proceeding. (See Transcriptof Commission Meeting, ``In the Matter of: Meeting on Waste ConfidenceProceeding,'' January 11, 1982, Washington, DC, pp. 148-160). This testimonyspecifically addressed safety issues related to water pool storage of spentfuel and supported the position that spent fuel could be stored for anindefinite period, citing the industry's written submittal to the Commissionin the proceeding. (See ``The Capability for the Safe Interim Storage ofSpent Fuel'' (Document 4 of 4), Utility Nuclear Waste Management Groupand Edison Electric Institute, July 1980). Some of this material alludedto in the oral testimony was subsequently referenced by the Commissionin its discussion of water pool storage issues and its Fourth Finding ofreasonable assurance that spent fuel and high level waste `` * * * willbe managed in a safe manner.'' (See 49 <T3>FR</T3> 346758 at pp. 34681-2, August 31, 1984).If a reactor with a 40-year initial license were to have that license renewedfor another 30 years, the Commission believes that the spent fuel generatedat that reactor can be safely stored for at least several decades pastthe end of the 70-year operating period. Adding to these 70 years the expected30-year post-0L period during which the Commission believes, udner Finding2, that sufficient repository capacity will be made available for any reactor'sspent fuel, the total storage time would be about 100 years.In making the original Fourth Finding, the Commission did not determinethat for technical or regulatory reasons, storage would have to be limitedto 70 years. This is apparent from the Commission's use of the words ``* * * for <T3>at least </T3>30 years beyond the expiration of that reactor's operatinglicense * * * [emphasis added].'' Similarly, in using the words ``at least''in its proposed revised Finding Four, the Commission is not suggesting30 years beyond the licensed life for operation (which may include theterm of a revised license) represents any technical limitation for safeand environmentally benign storage. Degradation rates of spent fuel instorage, for example, are slow enough that it is hard to distinguish bydegradation alone between spent fuel in storage for less than a decadeand spent fuel stored for several decades.The Commission's proposed revised Finding here is meant to apply both towet storage in reactor pools and dry storage in engineered facilities outsidethe reactor containment building. Both dry and wet storage will be discussedin detail next.Since the original Waste Confidence Decision, which found that materialdegradation processes in dry storage were well-understood, and that dry-storagesystems were simple, passive, and easily maintained, NRC and ISFSI operatorshave gained experience with dry storage which confirms the Commission's1984 conclusions. NRC staff safety reviews of topical reports on storage-systemdesigns, the licensing and inspection of storage at two reactor sites,and NRC promulgation of the part 72 amendment for MRS, have significantlyincreased the agency's understanding of the confidence in dry storage.Under NWPA section 218(a), DOE has carried out spent fuel storage researchand development as well as demonstration of dry cask storage at its IdahoNational Engineering Laboratory. Demonstration has been carried out formetal casks under review or previously reviewed by NRC staff. DOE has alsoprovided support to utilities in dry storage licensing actions (see Godlewski,N.Z., ``Spent Fuel Storage_An Update,'' <T3>Nuclear News, </T3>Vol. 30, No. 3, March 1987, pp. 47-52). Dry storage of spent fuel has become an available option for utilities,with at-reactor dry storage licensed and underway at two sites: The H.B.Robinson Steam Electric Plant, Unit 2, in South Carolina, and the SurryNuclear Station in Virginia. NRC has received an application for dry storageat Duke Power Company's Oconee Power Station site as well. This applicationis still under review, bu the environmental review is completed and anenvironmental assessment and finding of no significant impact have beenissued (see 53 FR 44133, November 1, 1988). Based on utility statementsof intent, and projections of need for additional storage capacity at reactorsites, the NRC staff expects numerous applications from utilities overthe next decade (see ``Final Version Dry Cask Storage Study,'' DOE/RW-0220,February 1989). Since the original Waste Confidence finding, the Commission has reexaminedlong-term spent fuel storage in issuing an amendment to 10 CFR part 72to address the storage of spent fuel and high-level radioactive waste inan MRS, as envisioned by Congress in section 141 of the NWPA. Under therule, storage in an MRS is to be licensed for a period of 40 years, withthe possibility for renewal. The Commission determined not to prepare anenvironmental impact statement for the proposed amendments to 10 CFR part72, however. (See 53 FR 31651, p. 31657, August 19, 1988.) An environmentalassessment and finding of no significant impact were issued because theCommission found that the consequences of long-term storage are not significant.The environmental assessment for 10 CFR part 72, ``Licensing Requirementsfor the Indpendent Storage of Spent Fuel and High-Level Radioactive Waste,''NUREG-1092, assessed dry storage of spent fuel for a period of 70 yearsafter receipt of spent fuel from a reactor:<ITAG tagnum="21">The basis chosen for evaluating license requirements for the long-termstorage of spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste in an MRSis an installation having a 70-year design lifetime and a 70,000 MTU storagecapability. This assessment focuses on the potential environmental consequencesfor a long-term storage period, a period for which the Commission needsto assure itself of the continued safe storage of spent fuel and high-levelradioactive waste and the performance of materials of construction. Thismeans the reliability of systems important to safety needs to be establishedto ensure that long-term storage of spent fuel and HLW does not adverselyimpact the environment. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">For example, the staff needs to establish that systems, such as concreteshielding, have been evaluated to determine how their physical propertieswithstand the consequences of irradiation and heat flux for about a 70-yearperiod. The Commission addressed structure and component safety for extendedoperation for storage of spent fuel in reactor water pools in the matterof waste confidence rulemaking proceeding. The Commission's preliminaryconclusion is that experience with spent fuel storage provides an adequatebasis for confidence in the continued safe storage of spent fuel for atleast 30 years after expiration of a plant's license. The Commssion istherefore confident of the safe storage of spent fuel for at least 70 yearsin water pools at facilities designed for a 40-year lifetime. The Commissionalso stated that its authority to require continued safe management ofspent fuel generated by licensed plants protects the public and assuresthem the risks remain acceptable. In consideration of the safety of drystorage of spent fuel, the Commission's preliminary conclusions were that[its] confidence in the extended dry storage of spent fuel is based ona reasonable understanding of the material degradation processes, togetherwith the recognition that dry storage systems are simpler and more readilymaintained. In response to Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 authorizations,the Commission noted; `* * * the Commission believes the information above[on dry spent fuel storage research and demonstration] is sufficient toreach a conclusion on the safety and environmental effects of extendeddry storage. All areas of safety and environmental concern (e.g., maintenanceof systems and components, prevention of material degradation, protectionagainst accidents and sabotage) have been addressed and shown to presentno more potential for adverse impact on the environmental and the publichealth and safety than storage of spent fuel in water pools.' At this time,the Commission is confident it can evaluate the long-term integrity ofmaterial for constructing an installation and provide the needed assurancefor safe storage of spent fuel and HLW to establish the licensibility ofan MRS over extended periods of time. The MRS fuel storage concepts discussedhere for revision of 10 CFR part 72 covers only dry storage concepts. [Referencesomitted]</ITAG>The Commission believe that its 1984 Fourth Finding should be changed toreflect the environmental assessment in the 10 CFR part 72 MRS rulemakingand other evidence that spent fuel can be stored, safely and without significantenvironmental impact, for extended periods. Although the Commission doesnot beleive storage in excess of a century to be likely, with or withoutan MRS, there is the potential for storage of spent fuel for times longerthan 30 years beyond the expiration of an initial, extended, or renewedreactor OL, if a reactor operating under such a license were prematurelyshut down. The Commission does not, however, see any significant safetyor environmental problems associated with storage for at least 30 yearsafter the licensed life for operation of any reactor, even if this effectivelymeans storage for at least 100 years, in the case of a reactor with a 70-yearlicensed life for operation.Under the environmental assessment for the MRS rule, the Commission hasfound confidence in the safety and environmental insignificance of drystorage of spent fuel for 70 years following a period of 70 years of storagein spent fuel storage pools. Thus, this environmental assessment supportsthe proposition that spent fuel may be stored safely and without significantenvironmental impact for a period of up to 140 years if storage in spentfuel pools occurs first and the period of dry storage does not exceed 70years.The Commission has also found that experience with water-pool storage ofspent fuel continues to confirm that pool storage is a benign environmentfor spent fuel that does not lead to significant degradation of spent fuelintegrity. Since 1984, utilities have continued to provide safe additionalreactor pool storage capacity through reracking, with over 110 such actionsnow completed. The safety of storage in pools is widely recognized amongcognizant professionsls. Specifically, the Commission notes one expert'sview that:<ITAG tagnum="21">During the last 40 years there has been very positive experience withthe handling and storing of irradiated fuel in water; thus wet storageis now considered a proved technology. There is a substantial technicalbasis for allowing spent fuel to remain in wet storage for several decades.For the past two decades, irradiated Zircaloy-clad fuel has been handledand stored in water. There continues to be no evidence that Zircaloy-cladfuel degrades significantly during wet storage_this includes: fuel withburnups as high as 41,000 MWd/MTU; continuous storage of low-burnup fuelfor as long as 25 years; and irradiation of fuel in reactors for periodsup to 22 years. Cladding defects have had little impact during wet storage,even if the fuel is uncanned. [References omitted.] [See Bailey, W.J. andJohnston, Jr. A.B., <T3>et al</T3>., ``Surveillance of LWR Spent Fuel in Wet Storage,'' NP-3765,Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI), October 1984, pp. 2-10.]</ITAG>This last conclusion has been reaffirmed by the same authors, who recentlywrote: ``There continues to be no evidence that LWR spent fuel with Zircaloyor stainless steel cladding degrades significantly during wet storage [EPRI1986; International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) 1982].'' (See ``Resultsof Studies on the Behavior of Spent Fuel in Storage,'' Journal of the Instituteof Nuclear Materials Management,'' Vol. XVI, No. 3, April 1988, p. 27.IVA).In addition to the confidence that the spent fuel assemblies themselveswill not degrade significantly in wet storage, there is confidence thatthe water pools in which the assemblies are stored will remain safe forextended periods:<ITAG tagnum="21">As noted in the recent IAEA world survey, the 40 years of positiveexperience with wet storage illustrates that it is a fully-developed technologywith no associated major technological problems. Spent fuel storage poolsare operated without substantial risk to the public or the plant personnel.There is substantial technical basis for allowing spent fuel to remainin wet storage for several decades. Minor, but repairable, problems haveoccured with spent fuel storage pool components such as liners, racks,and piping. [See Bailey, W.J., and Johnston, Jr., A.B., <T3>et al.,</T3> ``Surveillance of LWR Spent Fuel in Wet Storage,'' EPRINP-3765, prepared by Battelle Pacific Northwest Laboratories, Final Report,October 1984, p. 6-1.]</ITAG>The studies just cited support the view that rates of uniform corrosionof spent fuel cladding in storage pools are low over time. Localized corrosionon cladding surfaces has also been gradual and can be expected to remainso. Cladding that has undergone damage while in the reactor core has notresulted in significant releases of radioactivity when stored in pools.Furthermore, the operational experience accumulated since the 1984 WasteConfidence Decision and NRC experience in licensing and inspection reinforcethe conclusions in that Decision that wet storage involves a relativelybenign environment. There are no driving mechanisms, such as temperatureand pressure, to degrade storage structures or components or the fuel itself,or to spread contamination. Degradation mechanisms are gradual and wellunderstood; they allow ample time for remedial action, including repairor replacement of any failing systems. This extensive experience adequatelysupports predictions of long-term integrity of storage basins.The Commission also notes the endorsement of this basic confidence by cognizantprofessional organizations:<ITAG tagnum="21">The American Nuclear Society issued a policy statement [ANS 1986]in 1986 regarding storage of spent nuclear fuel. The statement indicatesthat continued wet storage of spent fuel at nuclear power plant sites untilthe federal government accepts it under existing contracts with the utilitiesis safe, economical and environmentally acceptable. [See Gilbert, E.R.,Bailey, W.J., and Johnston, A.B., ``Results of Studies on the Behaviorof Spent Fuel in Storage,'' Journal of the Institute of Nuclear MaterialsManagemnt, Vol. XVI, No. 3, April 1988, p. 27.IV A).]</ITAG>Thus, supported by the consistency of NRC experience with that of others,the Commission has concluded that spent fuel can be stored safely and withoutsignificant environmental impact, in either wet storage or in wet storagefollowed by dry storage, for at least 100 years. The Commission considersit unlikely, however, that any fuel will actually remain in wet storagefor 100 years or even for 70 years. We anticipate that, consistent withthe currently developing trend, utilities will move fuel rods out of spentfuel pools and into dry storage to make room in pools for freshly-dischargedspent fuel.Although the Commission has concluded that reactor spent fuel pools cansafely be used to store spent fuel for 100 years, there is no technicallycompelling reason to use them that long. If reactor licenses are renewedfor as long as 30 years, making a total of 70 years of operation, it willbe necessary to store the spent fuel discharged at the end of the reactor'soperation in a spent fuel pool for several years to allow for radioactivedecay and thermal cooling. After this period, the fuel could be placedin dry storage and the spent fuel pool decommissioned. Thus, for most reactors,the most likely maximum period of storage will be well within the extended30-year post-operational period under the Commission's proposed revisionto Finding 4. Moreover, considering that under certain conditions spentfuel can be stored safely and without significant environmental impactsfor up to 140 years, the Commission believes there is ample basis for confidencein storage for at least 100 years.In its 1984 Waste Confidence Decision, the Commission also concluded that``there are no significant additional non-radiological impacts which couldadversely affect the environment if spent fuel is stored beyond the expirationof operating licenses for reactors'' (see 49 FR 34658 at p. 34686, August31, 1984). The Commission did not find anything to contradict this conclusionin its 1988 rulemaking amending 10 CFR part 72 for long-term spent fueland high-level waste storage at an MRS:<ITAG tagnum="21">In August 1984, the NRC published an environmental assessment forthis proposed revision of part 72 NUREG-1092, `Environmental Assessmentfor 10 CFR part 72, Licensing Requirements for the Independent Storageof Spent Fuel and High-Level Radioactive Waste.' NUREG-1092 discusses themajor issues of the rule and the potential impact on the environment. Thefindings of the environmental assessment are `(1) past experience withwater pool storage of spent fuel establishes the technology for long-termstorage of spent fuel without affecting the health and safety of the public,(2) the proposed rulemaking to include the criteria of 10 CFR part 72 forstoring spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste does not significantlyaffect the environment, (3) solid high-level waste is comparable to spentfuel in its heat generation and in its radioactive material content ona per metric ton basis, and (4) knowledge of material degradation mechanismsunder dry storage conditions and the ability to institute repairs in areasonable manner without endangering the health [and safety] of the publicshows dry storage technology options do not significantly impact the environment.'The assessment concludes that, among other things, there are no significantenvironmental impacts as a result of promulgation of these revisions of10 CFR part 72.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Based on the above assessment, the Commission concludes that the rulemakingaction will not have a significant incremental environmental impact onthe quality of the human environment. [53 FR 31651 at pp. 31657-31658,August 19, 1988.]</ITAG>Thus, the 1988 amendments to 10 CFR part 72 provide the basis for the Commissionto conclude that the environmental consequences of long-term spent fuelstorage, including non-radiological impacts, are not significant.Finally, no considerations have arisen to affect the Commission's confidencesince 1984 that the possibility of a major accident or sabotage with offsiteradiological impacts at a spent-fuel storage facility is extremely remote.NRC has recently reexamined reactor pool storage safety in two studies,``Seismic Failure and Cask Drop Analyses of the Spent Fuel Pools at TwoRepresentative Nuclear Power Plants'' (NUREG/CR-5176) and ``Beyond DesignBasis Accidents in Spent Fuel Pools'' (NUREG-1353). These studies reaffirmedthat there are no safety considerations that justify changes in regulatoryrequirements for pool storage. Both wet- and dry-storage activities havecontinued to be licensed by the Commission. In its recent rulemaking amending10 CFR part 72 to establish licensing requirements for an MRS, the Commissiondid choose to eliminate an exemption regarding tornado missile impact ``** * to assure designs continue to address maintaining confinement of particulatematerial.'' (53 FR 31651, p. 31655, August 19, 1988). However, NRC staffhad previously considered tornado missile impacts in safety reviews ofdesign topical reports and in licensing reviews under 10 CFR part 72.4.B. Relevant Issues That Have Arisen Since the Commission's Original Decisionon Finding 4In its original Finding 4, the Commission found reasonable assurance ofsafe storage without significant environmental impacts for at least 30years beyond reactor OL expiration. Delays and uncertainties in the schedulefor repository availability since the 1984 Decision have convinced theCommission to allow some margin beyond the scheduled date for repositoryopening currently cited by DOE. As noted in Finding 2, the Commission hasreasonable assurance that at least one repository will be available withinthe first quarter of the twenty-first century. For all currently operatingreactors, this would still be within the period of 30 years from expirationof their OLs, which the Commission previously found to be the minimum periodfor which spent fuel storage could be considered safe and without significantenvironmental impact.Under the NWPA as amended, DOE is authorized to dispose of up to 70,000MTHM in the first repository before granting a construction authorizationfor a second. Under existing licenses, projected spent fuel generationcould exceed 70,000 MTHM as early as the year 2010. Possible extensionsor renewals of OLs also need to be considered in assessing the need forand scheduling the second repository. It now appears that unless Congresslifts the capacity limit on the first repository_and unless this repositoryhas the physical capacity to dispose of all spent fuel generated underboth the original and extended or renewed licenses_it will be necessaryto have at least one additional repository. Assuming here that the firstrepository is available by 2025 and has a capacity on the order of 70,000MTHM, additional disposal capacity would probably not be needed beforeabout the year 2040 to avoid storing spent fuel at a reactor for more than30 years after expiration of reactor OLs.Although action on a second repository before the year 2007 would requireCongressional approval, the Commission believes that Congress will takethe necessary action if it becomes clear that the first repository sitewill not have the capacity likely to be needed. If DOE were able to addressthe need for a second repository earlier, for example by initiating a surveyfor a second repository site by the year 2000, DOE might be able to reducethe potential requirement for extended spent fuel storage in the twenty-firstcentury. The Commission does not, however, find such action necessary toconclude that spent fuel can be stored safely and without significant environmentalimpact for extended periods.The potential for generation and onsite storage of a greater amount ofspent fuel as a result of the renewal of existing OLs does not affect theCommission's findings on environmental impacts. In Finding 4, the Commissiondid not base its determination on a specific number of reactors and amountof spent fuel generated. Rather, the Commission took note of the safetyof spent fuel storage and lack of environmental impacts overall, notingthat individual actions involving such storage would be reviewed. In theevent there were applications for renewal of existing reactor OLs, eachof these actions would be subject to safety and environmental reviews,with subsequent issuance of an environmental assessment or environmentalimpact statement, which would cover storage of spent fuel at each reactorsite during the period of the renewed license.The Commission also notes that the amount of spent fuel expected to bedischarged by reactors has continued to decline significantly, a trendalready noted in the Commission's discussion of its Finding 5 (49 FR 34658at p. 34687, August 31, 1984). At the time of the Commission's decision,``* * * the cumulative amount of spent fuel to be disposed of in the year2000 [was] expected to be 58,000 metric tons of uranium'' (see ``SpentFuel Storage Requirements'' (Update of DOE/RL-82-17) DOE/RL-83-1, January,1983). Today, that figure has declined to 40,384 metric tons (see ``SpentFuel Storage Requirements'' (DOE/RL-88-34), October 1988, p. A. 17). Thus,the amount of spent fuel considered likely to be discharged by the year2000 in the Commission's 1984 decision will not be attained until wellinto the second decade of the twenty-first century, if then.The Commission believes that its 1984 Finding 4 should be revised to acknowledgethe possibility and assess the safety and environmental impacts of extendedstorage for periods longer than 70 years. The principal reasons for thisproposed revision are that: (1) The long-term material and system degradationeffects are well understood and known to be minor; (2) the ability to maintainthe system is assured; and (3) the Commission maintains regulatory authorityover any spent fuel storage installation.On the basis of experience with wet and dry spent fuel storage and relatedrulemaking and licensing actions, the Commission concludes that spent fuelcan be safely stored without significant environmental impact for at least100 years, if necessary. Therefore, the Commission proposes to revise itsoriginal Fourth Finding thus: ``The Commission finds reasonable assurancethat, if necessary, spent fuel generated in any reactor can be stored safelyand without significant environmental impacts for at least 30 years beyondthe licensed life for operation (which may include the term of a revisedlicense) of that reactor at its spent fuel storage basin, or at eitheronsite or offsite independent spent fuel storage installations.''<ITAG tagnum="84">Original Finding 5</ITAG>The Commission finds reasonable assurance that safe independent onsitespent fuel storage or offsite spent fuel storage will be made availableif such storage capacity is needed.<ITAG tagnum="84">Proposed Finding 5</ITAG>Same as above.5.A. Issues Considered in Commission's 1984 Decision on Finding 5In its discussion of Finding 5 of its Waste Confidence Decision (49 FRN34658, August 31, 1984), the Commission said that:<ITAG tagnum="21">The technology for independent spent fuel storage installations, asdiscussed under the fourth Commission Finding, is available and demonstrated.The regulations and licensing procedures are in place. Such installationscan be constructed and licensed within a five-year time interval. Beforepassage of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 the Commission was concernedabout who, if anyone, would take responsibility for providing such installationson a timely basis. While the industry was hoping for a government commitment,the Administration had discontinued efforts to provide those storage facilities.* * * The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 establishes a national policyfor providing storage facilities and thus helps to resolve this issue andassure that storage capacity will be available.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Prior to March 1981, the DOE was pursuing a program to provide temporarystorage in off-site, or away-from-reactor (AFR), storage installations.The intent of the program was to provide flexibility in the national wastedisposal program and an alternative for those utilities unable to expandtheir own storage capacities.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Consequently, the participants in this proceeding assumed that, priorto the availability of a repository, the Federal government would providefor storage of spent fuel in excess of that which could be stored at reactorsites. Thus, it is not surprising that the record of this proceeding priorto the DOE policy change did not indicate any direct commitment by theutilities to provide AFR storage. On March 27, 1981, DOE placed in therecord a letter to the Commission stating its decision `to discontinueits efforts to provide Federal government-owned or controlled away-from-reactorstorage facilities.' The primary reasons for the change in policy werecited as new and lower projections of storage requirements and lack ofCongressional authority to fully implement the original policy.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The record of this proceeding indicates a general commitment on thepart of industry to do whatever is necessary to avoid shutting down reactorsor derating them because of filled spent fuel storage pools. While industry'sincentive for keeping a reactor in operation no longer applies after expirationof its operating license, utilities possessing spent fuel are requiredto be licensed and to maintain the fuel in safe storage until removed fromthe site. Industry's response to the change in DOE's policy on federally-sponsoredaway-from-reactor (AFR) storage was basically a commitment to do what isrequired of it, with a plea for a clear unequivocal Federal policy. * ** The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 has now provided that policy.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The Nuclear Waste Policy Act defines public and private responsibilitiesfor spent fuel storage and provides for a limited amount of federally-supportedinterim storage capacity. The Act also includes provisions for monitoredretrievable storage facilities and for a research development and demonstrationprogram for dry storage. The Commission believes that these provisionsprovide added assurance that safe independent onsite or offsite spent fuelstorage will be available if needed. [References omitted]</ITAG>The policy set forth in the NWPA regarding interim storage remains in place.Therefore, the Commission's confidence remains unchanged. The only policychange affecting storage involves long-term storage in an MRS. The NWPAAsets schedule restrictions on an MRS by trying it to the repository sitingand licensing schedule. These restrictions effectively delay implementationof an MRS. Consequently, its usefulness in providing storage capacity reliefto utilities is likely to be lost.Although the Commission's confidence in its 1984 Decision did not dependon the availability of an MRS facility, the possibility of such a facility,as provided for in the NWPA, was one way in which needed storage couldbe made available. The NWPAA makes an MRS facility less likely by linkingit to repository development. The potential impact of the decreased likelihoodof an MRS on the Commission's confidence is, however, more than compensatedfor by operational and planned spent fuel pool expansions and dry-storageinvestments by utilities themselves_developments that had not been madeoperational at the time of the original Waste Confidence Decision. Consequently,the statutory restrictions that may make an MRS ineffective for timelystorage capacity relief are of no consequence for the Commission's findingof confidence that adequate storage capacity will be made available ifneeded.Although the NWPAA limits the usefulness of an MRS by linking its availabilityto repository development, the Act does provide authorization for an MRSfacility. The Commission has remained neutral since its 1984 Waste ConfidenceDecision with respect to the need for authorization of an MRS facility.The Commission does not consider the MRS essential to protect public healthand safety. If any offsite storage capacity is required, utilities maymake application for a license to store spent fuel at a new site. Consequently,while the NWPAA provision does affect MRS development and therefore canbe said to be limiting, the Commission believes this should not affectits confidence in the availability of safe storage capacity.5.B. Relevant Issues That Have Arisen Since the Commission's Original Decisionon Finding 5DOE will not be able to begin operation of a repository before 2003 undercurrent plans, and operation might begin somewhat later. Given progressto date on an MRS, the link between MRS facility construction and repositoryconstruction authorization established by the NWPAA, and the absence ofother concrete DOE plans to store the spent fuel, it seems unlikely thatDOE will meet the 1998 deadline for taking title to spent fuel. (Undersection 302(a)(5)(B) of the NWPA, ``* * * the Secretary, beginning notlater than January 31, 1998, will dispose of the high-level radioactivewaste or spent nuclear fuel [subject to disposal contracts].'') This potentialproblem does not, however, affect the Commission's confidence that storagecapacity will be made available as needed.The possibility of a dispute between DOE and utilities over the responsibilityfor providing spent fuel storage will not affect the public health andsafety or the environment. Uncertainty as to contractual responsibilitiesraises questions concerning: (1) Who will be responsible; (2) at what pointin time responsibility for the spent fuel will be transferred; (3) howthe fuel will be managed; (4) how the transfer of management responsibilityfrom the utilities to DOE will take place; and (5) how the cost of DOEstorage might differ, if at all, from utility storage. Utilities possessingspent fuel in storage under NRC licenses cannot abrogate their safety responsibilities,however. Until DOE can safely accept spent fuel, utilities or some otherlicensed entity will remain responsible for it. If DOE and the utilitiescan amicably resolve their respective responsibilities for spent fuel storagein the interest of efficient and effective administration of the overallwaste management system, including the Nuclear Waste Fund, NRC would gainadded confidence in the institutional arrangements for spent fuel management(see also Finding 3 on this issue).Estimates of the amount of spent fuel generated have continued to decline.At the time of the Commission's Decision, the Commission cited in Finding5 the cumulative figure of 58,000 metric tons uranium of spent fuel generatedin the year 2000 (See 49 FR 34658, p. 34697, August 31, 1984.) More recently,DOE estimated 40,384 metric tons (See ``Spent Fuel Storage Requirements,''DOE/RL-88-34, October 1988, p. A. 17). Although estimates may show an increaseat some date well into the twenty-first century if licenses of some reactorsare renewed or extended, this possibility does not affect the Commission'sconfidence in the availability of safe storage capacity until a repositoryis operational. The industry has made a general commitment to provide storagecapacity, which could include away-from-reactor (AFR) storage capacity.To date, however, utilities have sought to meet storage capacity needsat their respective reactor sites. Thus, a new industry application forAFR storage remains only a potential option, which currently seems unnecessaryand unlikely.Utilities have continued to add storage capacity by reracking spent fuelpools, and NRC expects continued reracking where it is physically possibleand represents the least costly alternative. Advances in dry-storage technologiesand utility plans both have a positive effect on NRC's confidence. At thetime the Commission reached its original findings, dry storage of LWR spentfuel was, as yet, unlicensed under 10 CFR Part 72, and DOE's dry-storagedemonstrations in support of dry-cask storage were in progress at the IdahoNational Engineering Laboratory (INEL).Today, DOE's demonstration efforts have been successful (See Godlewski,N. Z., ``Spent Fuel Storage_An Update,'' </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T3>Nuclear News, </T3>Vol. 30, No. 3 March 1987, pp. 47-52, at p. 47.)Dry storage has been licensed at two reactor sites, and a third applicationis under review. Dry cask storage is licensed at Virginia Electric PowerCompany's Surry Power Station site (see License, SNM 2501 under DocketNo. 72-2), and dry-concrete module and stainless-steel canister storageis licensed at Carolina Power and Light Company's (CPandamp;L's) H. B. Robinson,Unit 2, site (see License SNM 2502, under Docket No. 72-3). An applicationis under review for a similar modular system at Duke Power Company's OconeeNuclear Station site (See Letter to Director, Division of Fuel Cycle andMaterial Safety, NRC, from Hal B. Tucker, Duke Power Company, dated March31, 1988, under Docket No. 72-4). A new application has been received in1989 for CPandamp;L's Brunswick site, and another is expected in 1989 forthe Baltimore Gas and Electric Company's Calvert Cliffs site. Applicationsare also expected for CPandamp;L's Robinson 2 site (at another onsite locationto allow for greater storage capacity), Wisconsin Electric Power Company'sPoint Beach site, and Consumer Power's Palisades site. The Tennessee ValleyAuthority has indicated that it will apply for its Sequoyah plant site.Thus, the successful demonstration by DOE of dry cask technology for variouscask types at INEL, utilities' actions to forestall spent fuel storagecapacity shortfalls, and the continuing sufficiency of the licensing recordfor the Commission to authorize increases in at-reactor storage capacityall strengthen the Commission's confidence in the availability of safeand environmentally sound spent fuel storage capacity.Renewal of reactor OLs will involve consideration of how additional spentfuel generated during the extended term of the license will be stored onsiteor offsite. There will be sufficient time for construction and licensingof any additional storage capacity needed.In summary, the Commission finds no basis to change the Fifth Finding inits Waste Confidence Decision. Changes by the NWPAA, which lessen the likelihoodof an MRS facility, and the potential for some slippage in repository availabilityto the first quarter of the twenty-first century (see our discussion ofFinding 2) are more than offset by the continued success of utilities inproviding safe at-reactor-site storage capacity in reactor pools and theirprogress in providing independent onsite storage. Therefore, the Commissioncontinues to find ``* * * reasonable assurance that safe independent onsitespent fuel storage or offsite spent fuel storage will be made availableif such storage is needed.''<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated at Rockville, Maryland, this 25th day of September, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">For the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">John C.
