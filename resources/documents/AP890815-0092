The United States broke off diplomatic relationswith Iran a decade ago.   At a pre-vacation news conference at the White House, Bush wasquestioned repeatedly about the possibility of military actionagainst those holding the hostages, and he replied that ``at somepoint we have to stand up for our interests, even if it meansmilitary, yet I'm not threatening military action.''   Later, he added, ``If I could find a way to take those hostages,get them, and bring them out and that required using the militaryforce of the United States, make no mistake about it, I would do itin an instant.''   The president fielded questions for 30 minutes on subjectsranging from economic policy to drug abuse. On those topics, he:   _ Refused to rule out kidnapping Panamanian leader Gen. ManuelAntonio Noriega to bring him to trial on drug trafficking charges.``I have an obligation to try to bring people to justice,'' he said.   _ Said he was ``comfortable'' with budget director RichardDarman's weekend comment that the Federal Reserve was keepinginterest rates too high to permit sustained growth.   _ Promised to return from his vacation in Maine on Sept. 5 with acomprehensive plan to attack the ``national menace'' of drug abuse.He said his plan would include additional federal spending, butwould not require higher taxes.   _ Said he wished the ``legal process'' could move along in thecase of Felix Bloch, a State Department official suspected ofespionage, ``without a lot of hype.'' Bloch has not been charged.   _ Called on the Democrat-controlled Senate to act speedily onmore than 100 high-level government appointments that awaitconfirmation.   _ Eulogized Reps. Mickey Leland and Larkin Smith, who died inrecent days in separate plane crashes. He said the two were ``fineindividuals (who) represented a deep caring for the poor, thedisadvantaged, the victims of drug abuse and crime and many otherareas.''   Bush was questioned repeatedly about the hostages in the MiddleEast, and the recent flurry of sensitive diplomatic efforts aimed atwinning the release of the eight Americans held in captivity.   He noted conflicting signals emanating from Iran in recent weeks.   ``We don't have to be hostile with Iran for the rest of ourlives,'' the president said. The hostages are thought to be held bythe Shiite religious group Hezbollah, a faction heavily influencedby the Iranians.   ``We're going to keep on trying but I can't give you a definitiveassessment'' of whether the hostages are any closer to freedom, Bushsaid.   ``I just don't know. There's a lot of lines out there, a lot ofinitiatives have been taken,'' he said.   Asked why he did not retaliate militarily after the murder of Lt.Col. William Higgins, Bush said the United States still did not haveadequate information to take either a diplomatic or militaryresponse. The Pentagon still is not certain when or how Higginsdied; on July 31, his captors released a videotape that showed himhanging from a makeshift gallows.   ``I do not want to be responsible for the loss of innocentlife,'' Bush said, adding that he was also concerned that anAmerican response could lead to harm for the remaining eighthostages.   He said that if he could mount an effective military rescue, ``Iwould do it in an instant.''   The president was asked whether he would consider seeking theextradition of Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid, whose capture last month bythe Israelis outraged his religious followers. ``We have no criminalindictment'' against Obeid in the kidnapping of Americans, Bushsaid. ``We wouldn't move against somebody without the legal processgoing forward.''   Bush generally endorsed Darman's criticism that the FederalReserve was harming economic growth by keeping interest rates toohigh.   ``I feel very comfortable with his (Darman's) sallying forth,''Bush said. ``I think I have said the same things in the past.''   However, Bush stopped short of saying that if a recessionoccurred, it would be the fault of policies by the central bank.   Bush went out of his way to emphasize his commitment to a newnational plan for fighting drug abuse, and said it would take a``full court press, not just in the federal government, but allacross society'' to deal with it. He said drug czar William Bennetthas given him a draft proposal, and said the plan he unveils nextmonth will be ``balanced, decisive, effective and achievable.'' Heoffered no details.   On the hostage issue, Bush said he had received ``magnificent''cooperation from world leaders, some of it unsolicited, but he didnot identify anyone by name.   Bush was asked about his Inauguration Day comment that goodwillwould beget goodwill in the U.S. relationship with Iran.   ``Now we see a new leader coming in and we hear different signalscoming out of Iran, some in the old mode, some that offer more hope.I would leave it stand that a clear and good signal would be therelease of the American hostages.''   He added, ``I just hope that the positive signs prevail, becausethere are some, they are encouraging.''</TEXT></DOC>
