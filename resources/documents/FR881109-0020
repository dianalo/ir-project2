Accordingly, this proposedrule describes the zones in which the use of lead shot would be prohibitedfor hunting waterfowl, coots and certain other species in the 1989-90 season.The zones described consist of (1) the same areas that were already identifiedas nontoxic shot zones for waterfowl and coot hunting in andSection;20.108of Title 50 of the Code of Federal Regulations (50 CFR) for the 1988-89hunting season, (2) the added counties identified for 1989-90 in AppendixN of the Final Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement (SEIS) on theUse of Land Shot for Hunting Migratory Birds in the United States (seeTable 1 in Supplementary Information) and (3) those additional areas indentifiedby the States where acceleration of the nontoxic shot phase-in scheduleis considered appropriate because of potential administrative, enforcementand/or lead poisoning problems. States that have declared a statewide banon the use of lead shot waterfowl and coot hunting are so noted.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATE: </T2>Comments on this proposal will be accepted until December9, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESS: </T2>Submit comments to Director (FWS/MBMO), U.S. Fish andWildlife Service, Department of the Interior, Room 536, Matomic Building,Washington, DC 20240.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2>Dr. Rollin D. Sparrowe, ChiefOffice of Migratory Bird Management, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Room536, Matomic Buidling, Washigton, DC 20240 (202/254-3207).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>This rule implements the third year(1989-90) of the 5-year component of the strategy to phase-in a nontoxicshot requirement for waterfowl hunting nationwide by 1991-92, as set outby the preferred alternative of the Final SEIS on the Use of Lead Shotfor Hunting Migratory Birds in the United States published in June 1986(FES 86-16). The SEIS and consequent rulemaking imposing nontoxic shotrequirements results from the Secretary of Interior's responsiblities underthe Migratory Bird Treaty Act (MBTA), as amended (16 U.S.C. 703 <T3>et seq.; </T3>40 Stat. 755), and the Endangered Species Act (ESA) of1973, as amended (16 U.S.C. 1531-1543; 87 Stat. 884), to decide whether,where and how migratory bird hunting will allowed. A critical element inthe Department of the Interior's deliberations and decision to implementand enforce regulations establishing nontoxic shot zones nationwide hasbeen the determination that lead poisoning resulting from waterfowl huntingis a significant annual mortality factor in certain migratory birds.Information detailing the scientific basis of concluding that lead shotfrom waterfowling is causing lead poisoning in certain migratory birdsand the development of the strategy to eliminate lead toxicity as a majormortality factor, including discussions of the issues for and against lead/steelshot, appears in the SEIS and the preamble to the proposed rule on thecriteria and schedule for implementing nontoxic shot zones for 1987-88and subsequent years published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on June 27, 1986 (51 FR 23444). The final rulefor the proposed rule was published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on November 21, 1986 (51 FR 42103). Informationon the justification for selecting this strategy has also been set outin the Final SEIS (Alternative VII<T2>3</T2>), the June 27, 1986, proposed rule and in the Record of Decisionconfirming the preferred alternative and published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on August 20, 1986 (51 FR 29673). Additionalinformation relating to the imposition of nontoxic shot zones nationwide,according to the 5-year schedule, is contained in the final rule for the1987-88 and 1988-89 waterfowl hunting seasons published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on Tuesday, July 21, 1987 (52 FR 27352) and onTuesday, June 28, 1988 (53 FR 24284), respectively.Counties scheduled to convert in their entireties to nontoxic shot in the1989-90 waterfowl season are those counties having had an average annualwaterfowl harvest of 10 or more per square mile over the 10-year period1971-80. As scheduled, aproxmately 79 percent of the waterfowl harvestnationwide will occur in nontoxic shot zones in the 1988-89 waterfowl huntingseason. However, the conversion of many entire States ahead of the scheduleis estimate to increase the percentage of the total waterfowl harvest occurringin nontoxic shot zones to be about 90 percent in this 1989-90 waterfowlhunting season.In summary, this rule proposes to amend andSection;20.108 of 50 CFR to addareas to expand existing nontoxic shot zones for the 1989-90 waterfowlhunting season.<ITAG tagnum="84">Economic Effect</ITAG>Executive Order 12291, ``Federal Regulation,'' of February 17, 1981, requiresthe preparation of regulatory impact analysis for major rules. A majorrule is one likely to result in an annual effect on the economy of $100million or more; a major increase in costs or prices for consumers, individualindustries, government agencies or geographic regions; or signficant adverseeffects on the ability of United States-based enterprises to compete withforeign-based enterprieses, The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (5 U.S.C.601 <T3>et seq.</T3>) further requires the preparation of flexibility analysesfor rules that will have a significant effect on a substantial number ofsmall entities, which includes small businesses, organizations and/or governmentaljurisdictions.In accordance with Excutive Order 12291, a determination has been madethat this rule is not a major rule. In accordance with the Regulatory FlexibilityAct, a determination has been made that this rule, if implemented withoutadequate notice, could result in lead shot ammunition supplies for whichthere would be no local demand. Conversely, nontoxic shot zones could conceivablybe established where little or no nontoxic shot ammunition would be availableto hunters. The FWS believes, however, that adequate notice has been providedand that sufficient supplies of nontoxic shot ammunition will be availableto hunters. Therefore, this rule would not have a significant economiceffect on a substantial number of small entities.<ITAG tagnum="84">Paperwork Reduction Act</ITAG>This rule will not result in the collection of information from, or placerecordkeeping requirements on, the public under Paperwork Reduction Actof 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 <T3>et seq</T3>.).<ITAG tagnum="84">Environmental Consideration</ITAG>Pursuant to the requirements of section 102(2)(C) of the National EnvironmentalPolicy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4332(C)), a Final Environmental Statement(FES) on the use of steel shot for hunting waterfowl in the United Stateswas published in 1976. As stated above, a supplement to the FES was completedin June 1986. In this supplement, pursuant to the Endangered Species Act,a section 7 consultation was done on the potential impacts of the provisionsof this rule on bald eagles. The section 7 opinion concluded that implementationof the preferred alternative would not be likely to jeopardize the continuedexistence of the bald eagle. Also, a recent section 7 opinion concludesthat the action being carried out is not likely to jeopardize the continuedexistence of the Aleutian Canada goose.<ITAG tagnum="74">Table 1_Counties proposed to be added in 1989-90 to the existing zoneswhere the hunting of waterfowl, coot and certain other species is limitedto the use of nontoxic shot.(\1\</ITAG><NOTE/>)<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>(\1\) Counties listed are taken from the Final SupplementalEnvironmental Impact Statement on the Use of Lead Shot for Hunting MigratoryBirds in the United States, Appendix N.
