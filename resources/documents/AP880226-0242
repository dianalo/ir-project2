Higher grocery prices partially offset declines inenergy costs.   The increase in the Labor Department's Consumer Price Index wasequivalant to an annual rate of inflation of 4.2 percent, comparedto the 4.4 percent rise for all of 1987.   Last month's increase was larger than the 0.2 percent rise inDecember and matched November's 0.3 percent rise. December'sincrease was revised from the previously reported 0.1 percent.   Pacing the January increase were widespread gains across a rangeof goods and services. Energy prices, however, supplied a majordampening on the overall rate by plunging 0.7 percent after a 0.8percent drop in the preceding month.   Gasoline prices fell 1.6 percent; heating oil costs were down0.8 percent. The price of natural gas and electricity, combined,fell 0.3 percent.   Food prices rose 0.3 percent, down from December's 0.6 percentgain. Pacing last month's rise were jumps in prices for poultry,eggs and bakery products. Meat, fruit and vegetable prices declined.   Subtracting the usually volative food and energy categories,consumer prices for all other goods and services rose a sharp 0.5percent in January after a 0.2 percent increase in December.   January's report underscored forecasts by many analysts that anysignificant change in the inflation rate was unlikely this year.   ``The underlying rate of inflation looks to be 3 percent to 4percent,'' said Allen Sinai, chief economist for The Boston CompanyEconomic Advisers. ``The question mark is on the energy priceside.''   The Reagan administration has predicted an inflation rate of 4.3percent this year.   Energy prices, which tumbled in 1986, partially reboundedthrough 1987. But more recently oil prices again have been falling,recently dipping below $17-a-barrel on the spot market from the$18-a-barrel prices that prevailed in December and from prices ofaround $19 a barrel in November.   While petroleum prices have fallen recently, anlaysts also saidthey expected to see a rise in natural gas costs.   ``Energy prices may continue to soften through late spring,providing continuing offsets to food prices, which are expected toremain on an upward path,'' said Donald Ratajczak, a Georgia StateUniversity economist who specializes in prices.   Supply shortages and weather and crop infestation problems,particularly in California and Arizona, have pushed up food pricesin recent months. After climbing through the fall, fruit andvegetable prices fell 0.4 percent last month.   Beef prices were down 1.4 percent while pork priced declined 0.5percent. Poultry prices, however, climbed 1.0 percent, their firstincrease since August. Cereal and bakery product prices rose 1.1percent.   Overall, grocery prices were up 0.2 percent while restaurantmeal costs climbed 0.3 percent.   The Labor Department gave these other specifics of January pricebehavior.   _New automobile prices were down 0.2 percent; used automobileprices fell 0.1 percent.   _Housing expenses were up 0.4 percent.   _Apparel costs gained 0.1 percent.   _Medical care expenses rose 0.8 percent, its largest increase intwo years.   _Entertainment costs gained 0.9 percent.   January's increase left the CPI at 115.7, meaning that aselection of goods and services that cost $100 during a 1982-84base period cost would have $115.70 last month.   The department recently abandoned a 1967 base period in favor ofthe 1982 standard. Under that base period, a selection of goods andservices costing $100 in that year would have cost $346.70 lastmonth.   Using either base number, the gain from January 1986 would havebeen $1.56.   The overall index is not adjusted for seasonal variations; otherfigures in the report are.   The major source of inflation in the months ahead likely is tocome from higher import prices resulting from declines in theforeign exchange value of the dollar.   The dollar is now worth only half of its 1985-value againstJapanese and key European currencies. These exchange rate changeshave begun to show up in the form of higher import prices for awide variety of goods. At the same time, U.S. items are becomingless expensive abroad.   The weaker dollar is expected to help trim the nation's hugetrade deficit, although higher priced foreign goods might be theprice Americans will have to pay for more trade balance.   Still, ``there is too much slack in the U.S. economy and toomuch slack in the world economy'' to worry about steep inflation asa result of higher import prices, said Jay Goldinger, chiefeconomist for Capital Insight, a Los Angeles bond brokerage.   Many economists say this slackness is illustrated by a recentslowdown in consumer spending _ a slowdown that will keepinflationary pressures at a minimum. Consumer spending dropped 3.1percent in the fourth quarter of 1987, the steepest plunge in morethan seven years, the Commerce Department reported on Thursday.   While most private economists deem a major bout of new inflationunlikely, Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan suggestedearlier this week that chances of a resurging inflation and of arecession are now roughly equal.   The companion producer price index, which only includesdomestically produced items and does not cover imports or services,showed a 0.4 percent rise in wholesale prices in January.</TEXT></DOC>
