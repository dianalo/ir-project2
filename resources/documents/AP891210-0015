Gorbachev's campaign to convince the world theKremlin is at one with the West in rejecting the tyranny of hispredecessors.   As one former satellite country after another has yielded inrecent weeks to public demands for reform after four decades ofCommunist rule, Gorbachev has stuck to his word. He has bid formembership in a world community of nations, and he is making itclear he is willing to pay the dues.   Those dues include making a break with the past and acts such assponsoring communist uprisings abroad, sending troops intoAfghanistan and ignoring treaty obligations.   After the withdrawal from Afghanistan, Foreign Minister EduardA. Shevardnadze admitted to the new Soviet legislature that theinvasion was illegal from the start. And he acknowledged what theUnited States claimed for years: that a giant radar installation inSiberia violated the U.S.-Soviet Antiballistic Missile Treaty andwould be dismantled.   The Soviet Union's expansionism was at the heart of the ColdWar. Competing ideologies could co-exist but Soviet hegemony,particularly in Eastern Europe after World War II, frightened thosewho would be free, from Berlin to the fields of the American MiddleWest.   Nowhere was Moscow's determination to control its satellitesmore evident than in Czechoslovakia, where Warsaw Pact tankscrushed the Prague regime's attempt in 1968 to ease strict centralcontrols and give Communism ``a human face.''   Soviet leader Leonid I. Brezhnev's rationale for stepping in toprevent Czechoslovakia from choosing its own course was that therecould be no retreat from socialism. It became known as the BrezhnevDoctrine and kept the Kremlin's Eastern European neighbors in checkfor two decades.   The doctrine's thesis of limited sovereignty for countrieswithin the Soviet orbit became a symbol of the Kremlin's dominationover its allies.   Gorbachev first signaled his willingness to reconsider thedoctrine when he visited Prague in April 1987, two years aftertaking power.   In a tentative recognition that the ruling parties in othersocialist countries needn't follow Moscow in lock step, he said,``Foreign parties determine their political course with due regardfor national conditions.''   But it was months later, when addressing Communist Party leadersfrom many countries where they were in and out of power, thatGorbachev said they were free to seek their own solutions tonational problems.   ``Unity does not mean being identical or uniform,'' he toldthem. ``We have also become convinced that socialism does not, andcannot, have a model with which all (socialist systems) arecompared.''   Just one year ago, in an address to the United Nations that mostclearly spelled out his foreign policy goals, Gorbachev endorsedthe Western idea that all people should have the freedom to choosetheir own political system.   It remained, however, for the Kremlin to live up to his words.   Last July, after Hungary embarked on a course toward freeelections and the Polish government agreed to legalize Solidarityas an independent trade union, leaders of the Warsaw Pact met inBucharest, Romania, and declared they would not interfere in eachother's domestic reforms.   Weeks later, Solidarity controlled the parliament and Gorbachevspoke with Polish Communist Party officials by telephone,reportedly assuring them he would not object to a coalitiongovernment led by Solidarity. A non-communist, Tadeusz Mazowiecki,was elected prime minister, ending 40 years of Communist rule inPoland.   Gorbachev visited East Berlin in October and, according to EastGerman party sources, made clear no Warsaw Pact troops would becalled in to quell protests of the hard-line regime of party chiefErich Honecker. Without Moscow to prop him up, Honecker was ousted12 days later. On Nov. 9 the Berlin Wall was ruptured.   In the fall, after President Bush had visited Hungary and Polandand after Washington began to receive reports that Gorbachev mightbe in political trouble at home, the U.S. administration ended aprotracted policy review and concluded the Kremlin meant whatGorbachev said.   U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III called it a``historic opportunity,'' a chance to ``leave behind the postwarperiod with the ups and downs of the Cold War,'' and he declaredU.S. support for the Soviet leader's reform efforts.   Gorbachev declared himself sympathetic with all the reformmovements rending the once-unified East Bloc.   ``They are extremely different in their starting conditions,economic possibilities, in their level of political culture andhistorical heritage,'' Tass paraphrased Gorbachev as telling aforeign visitor. ``But they have a common direction, which fostersthe building of a European home, for it makes the countries closer,more open and creates new opportunities for human contact and anequal exchange.''   On Sunday, Czechoslovakia formed its first non-Communistdominated government in 41 years.   Czechoslovakia's rush to escape the hard-line Communist rulethat has dominated since the Soviet invasion 21 years ago receivedGorbachev's public endorsement last week as hundreds of thousandspoured into the streets to demand reform.   Asked at a news conference on the eve of his summit with Bush tocomment on the ill-fated ``Prague Spring'' reforms of 1968,Gorbachev reminded his audience the crackdown took place in anatmosphere charged by the superpower arms race and an deologicalstruggle between East and West.   But the reform movement, he said, ``was right at that time andis right now.''   Last Monday, after gathering to hear Gorbachev's report on histalks with Bush in Malta, the leaders of the Warsaw Pact nationsthat took part in the Czechoslovak invasion agreed the action hadbeen a mistake.   A statement by the heads of the Soviet Union, Bulgaria, Hungary,East Germany and Poland said the entrance of their troopsconstituted ``interference in the internal affairs of a sovereignCzechoslovakia and must be condemned.''   Romania, still run by hard-liner Nikolae Ceausescu, was not aparticipant in the invasion and did not join in issuing thestatement. Czechoslovakia itself had issued an earlier condemnation.</TEXT><TEXT>   EDITOR'S NOTE: Michael Putzel is chief of The Associated Pressbureau in Moscow.</TEXT></DOC>
