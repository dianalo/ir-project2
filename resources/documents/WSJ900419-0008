RollingStone magazine has named the bearded balladeer in its &quot;Hallof Shame&quot; hit list of international environmental sinners.The magazine also included the Journal's editorial page onits roster -- a more predictable choice. But we weresurprised to find ourselves in such affable company. RollingStone describes Mr. Rogers as an &quot;ardent apologist for theLos Angeles-based Summit Cement Company, which has sought todump toxic wastes from the U.S. mainland on Grand BahamaIsland.&quot; Rolling Stone says Mr. Rogers flew the Bahamianhealth minister to Florida to help Summit.   Wrong, says Kenny. He did fly ministers to Florida, but itwas because he was thinking of buying a hotel from theBahamian government. The singer is indeed a friend ofSummit's president, Finn Moller. But the only &quot;help&quot; Mr.Rogers gave Mr. Moller was to aid him in investigating theenvironmental safety of a plant Summit thought of buying onGrand Bahama. In fact, charges Mr. Rogers, Rolling Stone onlyheard about the matter because his own investigation was solarge.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Rogers is on a 70-city concert tour with Dolly Parton.But during a break he spoke with Amity Shlaes of theeditorial page by phone from his farm in Athens, Ga.Excerpts:                                                                                                          What did you feel when you saw your name in Rolling Stone?   This kind of thing really takes the wind out of yoursails. It makes you wonder why you do things in life.                                                                                                          What really hap pened with the ce ment plant in theBahamas?   At the start I was interested in re searching whether theplant would be safe because I was thinking of investing {inthe Bahamas} myself. What I found was there are already 15cement plants of this type operating legally in the UnitedStates. They use hazardous waste not toxic waste {as RollingStone asserts}. Every one of those {plants} wrote me positiveletters. Then I call Greenpeace in San Francisco. I say tothem as a joke: &quot;I know that you guys are the shark in thissituation&quot; -- meaning that they are the hardcore people whocan answer. The guy says &quot;off the record, I'm sure the plantis safe but I still can't approve.&quot;                                                                                                          What did he mean?   It appears some people would rather win than be right.                                                                                                          Why is it OK to build a plant that uses hazardous waste atall?   I am a strange kind of guy. In the world there are veryfew things that are black and white. In this case thehazardous waste, a petroleum byproduct, is used to make aproduct that is safe. {In general} something needs to be donewith hazardous waste. Until we find an alternative source,what do you do with that waste? This seemed a good use.                                                                                                          Why do you think Greenpeace and Rolling Stone are pickingon you?   They jumped on the bandwagon and used me because I getmore press than anybody else.                                                                                                          What does Dolly think?   She has never mentioned it. We usually run into each otheronly on stage.                                                                                                          Are you doing anything for Earth Day?   In my business you learn early that you have to pick yourcauses. Mine are world hunger and the homeless. Every year Ihost a weekend here at my farm to raise money for thehomeless.                                                                                                          Has environmentalism gone too far in America?   I have never been a person who admires extremists in anyfield.                                                                                                          Robert Vare, the Rolling Stone editor who handled the&quot;Hall of Shame&quot; section, says the magazine stands by itsreport. Kenny Rogers never did buy the hotel on the Bahamas.Finn Moller, the man who wanted to buy the cement plant, saysenvironmentalist roadblocks forced him to give up theproject, which would have brought 400 jobs to theunderemployed islands.   As someone once sang: You've got to know when to hold 'em,know when to fold 'em.</TEXT></DOC>
