The entire regulatory package was submittedto EPA on June 21, 1985, to be incorporated into the District's SIP. Becauseof the complexities of this package, the regulatory reform changes willbe covered by another notice. This notice will only address the ReasonablyAvailable Control Technology (RACT) regulation for a major printing operationin the District of Columbia.As part of the control strategy for attainment of the National AmbientAir Quality Standard (NAAQS) for ozone, the District revised its SIP torequire controls representing the application of RACT for stationary sourcesof VOCs. The District of Columbia was required to develop VOC emissioncontrols in order to receive an extension for achieving the ozone NAAQS.Section 172 of the Clean Air Act allows EPA to grant extensions to thoseStates which could not demonstrate attainment of the ozone standard byDecember 31, 1982, if the State revised its air pollution control programregulations. The revised program had to include RACT emission limits forvarious types of VOC sources located in nonattainment areas. Since theDistrict could not demonstrate attainment by December 31, 1982, for achievingthe ozone NAAQS, it requested and received an extension to December 31,1987, for achieving the ozone NAAQS. This extension was granted on December16, 1981, (See 46 FR 61254). One of the conditions for approval was thatthe District would develop RACT regulations for all sources that are coveredby Control Technique Guidelines (CTG), and for major non-CTG sources. Theonly non-CTG source identified in the District is the U.S. Bureau of Engravingand Printing (BEP). The District, with the assistance of the BEP, developedregulations to reduce plant VOC emissions by at least 50% by December 31,1987. The regulations require the control of fugitive press emissions byreducing the VOC content in ink solvents, wiping solutions and dampeningsolutions, and of pressdryer emissions by installing and operating afterburners.The BEP is the only facility of its kind in the nation, warranting thedetermination of a source-specific RACT standard. There are no other sourcesto which this regulation will apply in the District. Further informationrelated to this regulation can be found in the Technical Support Document(TSD). This notice will address the District's non-CTG regulation for printingoperations.<ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Discussion</ITAG>The revision that the District of Columbia submitted to EPA on June 21,1985, includes the reorganization and updating of the existing regulations.Also, included in the District's submittal are new regulations for thecontrol of VOC emissions from a printing operation that is not coveredby EPA's Control Technique Guidelines. The new regulations can be foundin section 710 (Engraving and Plate Printing) in Title 20 of the Districtof Columbia Municipal Regulations.Under these provisions the District's control strategy requires:1. Reductions in the percent content of VOC for inks, wiping solutionsand dampening solutions. The percent reductions in VOC, the respectiveprinting units and compliance time schedules are listed in Table 1.2. Reductions of fugitive emissions by the use of inking cylinders or othertechniques wherever possible.3. A 90% VOC reduction from two heatset ovens through the use of a controldevice, except for water-based solvents. 4. All forms of intaglio printing to be in final compliance by December31, 1987.5. Provisions for an alternative VOC emission reduction system(s).6. Reductions due to improved maintenance and operational practices.7. Reductions due to improved storage and disposal practices.As stated in item 5 above, the District's control strategy allows for alternativeVOC emission reduction system(s) provided that:(a) The system(s) is demonstrated to have at least equivalent results asthose of this rule, in limiting emissions of VOC.(b) The alternative system(s) shall be approved by the Mayor. EPA is proposingto approve this equivalency provision as an available <T3>mechanism</T3> under the SIP whereby alternative controls may be established.However EPA approval of this mechanism will <T3>not</T3> constitute pre-approval of any alternative requirements setunder the provisions. Before any such alternative can become incorporatedinto the SIP and thereby federally enforceable, it must be submitted toEPA and finally approved as a SIP revision.At the time of final approval EPA intends to exercise its authority throughsection 114 of the Clean Air Act to require BEP to obtain and maintainthe information that EPA needs to determine whether the source is in violationof the federally approved state implementation plan (SIP). Because recordkeepingis essential to determining continuous compliance with emission standards,EPA will impose periodic recordkeeping requirements (e.g., 1 month perquarter). Information required will include the percentage VOC content(by weight) and will apply to the inks and solutions as contained in thestorage wells (fountains) of the printing units. This information willhave to be developed on a daily basis for the period covered. EPA encouragesthe District to require similar recordkeeping requirements under Districtlaw.EPA's authority under section 114 is not subject to a requirement for noticeand comment; however, any party may comment on EPA's intentions regardingthe exercise of section 114 authority in this way in the same way as commentsare required for other aspects of this proposed action as outlined in theprocedures set forth in this notice. <ITAG tagnum="84">Proposed Action</ITAG>EPA is proposing to approve 20 DCMR section 710 as part of the Districtof Columbia's SIP. This regulation implements the required RACT controlprogram for printing operations in the District. A more detailed descriptionof EPA's evaluation of the above regulatory change is presented in theTechnical Support Document (TSD) that is available for public inspectionat the EPA located listed in the above addresses.EPA is soliciting public comments on this notice and on issues relevantto today's proposed actions. Comments will be considered before takingfinal action. Interested parties may participate in the Federal rulemakingprocess by submitting written comments to the EPA Regional office listedin the addresses section above.Under 5 U.S.C. 605(b), I certify that this SIP revision will not have asignificant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities (See46 FR 8709). The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this rule from the requirementsof section 3 of the Executive Order 12291. <ITAG tagnum="52">List of Subject in 40 CFR 52</ITAG>Air pollution control, Hydrocarbons, Intergovernmental relations, Ozone,Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.<ITAG tagnum="21">Date: August 2, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">James M.
