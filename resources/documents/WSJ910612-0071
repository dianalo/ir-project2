He favors a bigger voicefor Japan in the multilateral financial institutions, wouldlike to help the beleaguered Soviet Union, and proclaimssupport for free trade, even a U.S.-Mexico trade pact.</LP><TEXT>   But he is plainly tired of the chronic criticism Japanendures, especially from the U.S., over its trade policiesand economic aggressiveness. That is where his flexibilitystops.   &quot;I wish people would understand that Japan isn't animmature democracy where those at the top {of society} canforcibly suppress those at the bottom,&quot; Mr. Hashimoto saidTuesday in a rare interview. The will of its people, he said,takes precedent -- not pressure from above, or from otherworld capitals.   &quot;After World War II, during the occupation, the U.S., asthe occupying army, made tremendous efforts to sow the seedsof democracy in Japan,&quot; he said. &quot;I want the U.S. to havemore confidence in the outcome&quot; of those policies.   At age 53, Mr. Hashimoto is relatively young to be so nearthe pinnacle of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party. He iswidely considered a strong contender to become the party'snext president, and thus prime minister, should the currentpremier, Toshiki Kaifu, step down or be removed at the end ofhis term in October. In his trademark conservative bluesuits, and with a brother who was a popular televisionpersonality, Mr. Hashimoto is liked by young and femalevoters, who find him charming, yet assertive about Japan'sposition in the world.   &quot;If Japan has a problem at the moment, it is that inpursuing democracy as taught to it by the U.S., it hasacquired a bad habit: Instead of making our own decisions, wewait until the U.S. makes a decision before taking action,&quot;he said. &quot;We have to frankly state our opinions, to debatethings with the U.S., and on that basis, point out that weare diligently trying to establish mutual rules.&quot;   Mr. Hashimoto described as &quot;regrettable&quot; the recent harshcharacterizations of the reasons for Japan's steadily growingeconomic might by French Prime Minister Edith Cresson and, inparticular, by a briefing report commissioned by the U.S.Central Intelligence Agency. An unauthorized and incompletedraft portion of the study, reported in several U.S.newspapers last week, described Japanese as &quot;creatures of anamoral, manipulative and controlling&quot; culture who aremotivated solely by economic concerns.   While he said he doesn't want other countries &quot;to accuseJapan of hurrying to dominate the world through its economicpower,&quot; Mr. Hashimoto suggested that Japan should expand itsinfluence in world financial institutions. Although Japan isthe second-largest contributor to institutions such as theInternational Monetary Fund and the World Bank, neither hasever been managed by a Japanese; the IMF is run by a Frenchmanaging director, while the World Bank's president isAmerican.   Mr. Hashimoto skirted a question about whether Japan wantsthe IMF's top spot. But he added: &quot;We hope the number ofJapanese officials -- not just in the IMF, but in many otherinternational financial institutions -- will increase in thefuture.&quot;   Still, Japan isn't expected to push too forcefully for theleadership positions in those institutions. &quot;I don't have anyintention of furnishing others an opportunity to call Japanan economic animal by displaying an inordinate interest&quot; inhaving a Japanese national head the IMF, Mr. Hashimoto saidwith a laugh.   In the interview, Mr. Hashimoto said Japan would welcome ameeting with Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev next monthduring the London summit of the seven major industrializeddemocracies. But he insisted that Mr. Gorbachev shouldn'tparticipate in the summit itself but should meet with Westernleaders outside that venue to explain his country's reformefforts.   Before any of the industrialized democracies give money tothe Soviets, Mr. Hashimoto said, the Western leaders willwant assurances that the Soviet Union will follow coherentand sound economic policies. They will want to know that theSoviet leaders have read the economic recommendationscompiled by the IMF and other multilateral agencies, and theywill want political assurances.   &quot;We want to know who it is that is seeking our support. Isit the U.S.S.R. or is it the Russian republic, and how doesMr. Gorbachev understand the relationship between the two?&quot;Mr. Hashimoto asked. Capital-rich Japan, which has alongstanding territorial dispute with the Soviet Union, hasbeen reluctant to provide much financial assistance to itsgiant neighbor.   At the same time, Japan, the world's largest donor ofofficial aid, with nearly $9 billion flowing to needycountries last year, is imposing restrictions on itsdistribution of money, Mr. Hashimoto said. Following a speechby Prime Minister Kaifu to the Diet, or parliament, in April,Japan is requiring assurances that aid recipients aren'tsquandering funds on huge military expenditures or engagingin large-scale arms trading, Mr. Hashimoto said. &quot;We alsotake into consideration the degree of democratization&quot; in therecipient nation, &quot;trends in its economy, and whether itsgovernment protects basic human rights.&quot;   Mr. Hashimoto noted that expanding common markets inseveral areas of the world could help impoverished countries,as long as they are open to free trade. Agreements betweenthe U.S. and its two major neighbors, Canada and Mexico,appear to fit that description, he said. He smiled broadlywhen asked if the specifics of the agreements pose problemsfor the three nations' trade relations with Japan. &quot;I believethat they don't,&quot; he said.</TEXT></DOC>
