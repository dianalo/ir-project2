The cutbacks are designed to carry out earlier pledges toshrink the size of the armed forces in response to budgetcuts, and to meet force reductions that will be required inEurope under the conventional arms control treaty expected tobe signed in November. That treaty will require the U.S., theU.S.S.R., and 21 other countries to reduce the number oftheir tanks and other weapons in Europe.</LP><TEXT>   Defense officials said the closings aren't connected withthe current U.S. troop buildup in Saudi Arabia, which isdesigned to force Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait. Indeed,administration officials said the bases closings would be sogradual that they wouldn't free any significant number oftroops for use in the Persian Gulf any time soon.   The closings will take place slowly over several years,starting with the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1.   &quot;It's partly a matter of the obvious changing situation,&quot;said Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams. &quot;As the threat changesin Eastern Europe, as the Soviet forces pull back, as EasternEuropean governments change, become democratically elected,clearly the nature of our deployments in . . . Europe changesas well.&quot;   Mr. Williams added that &quot;the second thing we have tocontend with is declining budgets in future years.&quot;   The 150 military &quot;sites&quot; range from tiny support posts tolarge air bases, but don't include any of the most importantU.S. combat bases in the heart of central Europe. The largestaffected installations are three air bases: Torrejon inSpain, and Lindsey and Hessich Oldendorf in West Germany. All150 sites are clustered around 44 locations, the Pentagonsaid.   The Pentagon declined to estimate the number of troopsthat will be withdrawn from Europe as a result of thecutbacks, nor the costs involved. Officials said some troopsserving at the affected sites might simply be moved to othersin the U.S. or abroad.   The announcement is certain to be welcomed in Moscow,which is pulling all its troops out of Europe and had beenpressing the administration to make a unilateral statement ofits own intentions.   Rep. Pat Schroeder (D., Colo.), chairwoman of the housesubcommittee on military installations, called the list&quot;disappointing.&quot; She said &quot;these sites include gas stationson the autobahn, isolated housing units and athletic fields,and sites which had long ago been slated for closure.Facilities like these are closed every day at bases in theU.S.&quot;   The Pentagon doesn't require congressional approval toclose the foreign facilities, as it would if they werelocated in the U.S.</TEXT></DOC>
