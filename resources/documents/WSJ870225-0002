Soviet buying of U.S. grain had dried up in recent months, to the point that U.S. officials accused the Soviets of imposing an &quot;embargo&quot; on such purchases. Wheat and corn sales to the Soviet Union in the third year, ended Sept. 30, of a five-year U.S.-Soviet grain agreement, totaled seven million tons, including just 153,000 tons of wheat. The Soviets had agreed to buy at least four million tons each of corn and wheat each year of the pact.    Meanwhile, U.S. and Soviet negotiators concluded two days of talks here yesterday on the long-term grain agreement. Soviet officials said they will continue buying wheat, corn and soybeans under the agreement but didn't say how much, department officials said.    Richard Goldberg, deputy agriculture undersecretary, said &quot;We think our wheat prices . . . are competitive.&quot; But Soviet negotiators disagreed, Mr. Goldberg said. The Soviets last year spurned a U.S. offer to sell four million tons of subsidized wheat, contending that even with the subsidy, the sale still exceeded world wheat prices. </TEXT></DOC>
