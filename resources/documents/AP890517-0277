Boeing spokesmen remained mum on the discussions in Seattle,except to confirm they had started.   But Henrik Wolleswinkel, leader of the Dutch negotiators meetingwith Boeing and of the European team that will certify the new jet,was optimistic about the talks.   In an interview with The Seattle Times before the discussionsbegan, Wolleswinkel said he believes a temporary operating permitmight be issued, and that the European agencies might give Boeingone to three years to modify the plane to their standards.   Regulatory agencies in the Netherlands, France, Britain and WestGermany have asked Boeing to modify the design of floor beamssupporting the new jets' upper decks and to provide betterseparation of some electrical circuits. The four agencies form theJoint Airworthiness Requirements Committee.   Dutch Transport Ministry spokesman Harald Hameleers hascharacterized the changes as minor. ``We think the 747-400 is asafe plane but there is always room for improvement,'' he said.   Boeing spokesman David Jimenez said the aircraft maker was notcommenting on the issues raised by the Europeans. ``We're keepingthat for the table,'' he said, ``but we are confident that thesediscussions will lead to approval.''   The Dutch are taking a lead role in the issue, andrepresentatives of the other European agencies have said theNetherlands speaks in the name of all four.   On Thursday, KLM Royal Dutch Airlines is to become the firstEuropean carrier to take delivery of a 747-400. The Europeans'objections have called that delivery date into question, butWolleswinkel said he expects the plane to fly to Amsterdam asscheduled.   He also said a temporary operating permit might be issued toallow the plane to enter commercial service.   The 747-400, which Boeing began delivering earlier this year, isthe world's largest passenger aircraft, capable of carrying 412passengers more than 8,000 miles.</TEXT></DOC>
