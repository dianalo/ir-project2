The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended at a record, up38.69 to 3272.81.</LP><TEXT>   Market watchers had settled in for a quiet session similarto Monday's mild ride when comments by Federal ReserveChairman Alan Greenspan woke up bond buyers. Prices forTreasury issues began climbing after Mr. Greenspan told theHouse Budget Committee that the central bank is &quot;continuingto evaluate&quot; whether further monetary easing is needed to getthe economy growing.   Comments by the central bank chief last week appeared toleave less hope for a Fed move, and prompted a slump in bondsand some selling in stocks.   Stocks responded reluctantly at first to the surge in bondprices, but finally rallied sharply at the end of the day.   &quot;If we are going to get a rally in bonds, that should takeaway the threat of an interest rate-induced correction instock prices,&quot; said James R. Solloway, director of researchat Argus Research.   The buying reached into all sectors of the market, liftingthe Standard andamp; Poor's 500-Stock Index 4.32 to 413.85, andsending the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index up 2.18to 228.79. The Dow Jones Equity Market Index added 4.02 to390.46.   Autos were among the market's best performing groups. Thestocks, which trailed far behind the rest of the market inthe rally from mid-December, built on Monday's strong gains.The car makers reported better-than-expected sales for lateJanuary. General Motors rose 1 to 35, Chrysler gained 1 3/8to 16 3/8, and Ford added 5/8 to 33 3/8.   Big Board advancers led decliners, 1,116 to 620. Volumerose to 231,490,000 shares, up from Monday's 182,130,000shares.   Robert Walberg, equity analyst at MMS International, saidthe markets may have gotten carried away on Mr. Greenspan'scomments.   Uncertainty about the final shape of the fiscal stimuluspackage proposed by President Bush should keep the Fed'shands tied for now, said Mr. Walberg. He argued that untilthe Fed can gauge the inflationary effect of the governmentplan, it will be reluctant to cut interest rates further.Lower rates on top of tax cuts could speed up inflation.   In fact, the record by the Dow Jones Industrial Averagemasks a more lethargic performance by the rest of the market.The Sandamp;P 500 is still below the level at which it entered thisyear, the Dow Jones Utility Average remains moribund, and theDow Jones Transportation Average is off sharply from itsmid-January peak.   Dick Evans, a Flossmoor, Ill., investment adviser, saidthe divergence between the transportation average and theindustrials is particularly unsettling.   &quot;When you've had a good advance and then get divergence,that usually leads to a pretty sharp correction,&quot; said Mr.Evans.   He already sees a 200-point drop in store for the DowJones industrials. The wider the divergence becomes betweenthe industrials and the transports, the harder theindustrials will eventually fall, he predicted.   Merck was the leader among those stocks boosting theindustrial average. The drug company jumped 4 1/2 to 158 7/8after a Food and Drug Administration advisory panel voted torecommend approval of Merck's Proscar drug for treatment ofprostate enlargement.   Goodyear Tire andamp; Rubber rose 2 3/4 to 64 3/4, rising alongwith the auto stocks. Du Pont gained 2 to 48.   Dow Jones jumped 3/4 to 31 on volume of 2.62 millionshares, compared with a daily average of 119,634. EdwardGaylord, owner of Oklahoma Publishing, said his company soldtwo million shares -- 2% of the stock outstanding -- to&quot;raise cash and diversify&quot; its portfolio. Oklahoma Publishingcontinues to own 2.5 million shares of Dow Jones, whichpublishes The Wall Street Journal. A group of institutionalinvestors bought the shares in a trade handled by FirstBoston. Also, Salomon Brothers analyst Ed Atorino raised hisestimate of the company's 1992 earnings to $1.45 a share from$1.35, in anticipation of increasing financial advertising.   Home Shopping Network gained 1 to 6 3/8 on heavy volume.Traders attributed the gains in part to comments made byfinancial columnist Dan Dorfman, who spoke about the stock onCNBC/FNN. Mr. Dorfman suggested Fidelity Investments wasbuying the stock.   Computer chip stocks rallied, including Advanced MicroDevices, which gained 1 1/8 to 20 5/8, and Motorola, whichrose 1 1/4 to 77 1/4.
