Both the Bundesbank and the Bank of England recently pushed through increases of their own. And analysts said it was highly unlikely that the Bundesbank's Central Bank Council would come back from its summer recess for an extraordinary meeting to raise its rates further.    The Fed stunned most traders and economists when it announced a 1/2-point increase in its discount rate to 6 1/2%. The discount rate is a central bank's minimum lending rate to financial institutions. The news sent the mark tumbling against the dollar. &quot;It was a surprise for the market and for me,&quot; said Ulrich Ramm, economist at Commerzbank AG. &quot;But there's no acute necessity for the Bundesbank to act&quot; on interest rates.    The Bundesbank and West Germany's Finance Ministry declined to comment on the U.S. rate increase. But West German officials privately expressed little surprise, observing that the Fed had been tightening U.S. money-market interest rates for several weeks.    However, the mark's plunge against the dollar did fuel speculation that the Bundesbank will come under more pressure to raise West German interest rates to prop up its currency. In recent weeks, the Bundesbank not only has raised interest rates, but it also has intervened heavily in currency markerts in an effort to support the flagging Deutsche mark. Bundesbank officials fear a falling mark increases the potential for imported inflation.    The Bundesbank's next scheduled opportunity to alter its leading interest rates will come Aug. 25, when the council returns from its recess.    The Bundesbank yesterday left the rate it charges on its one-month securities repurchase agreements unchanged at 4 1/4%. The repo rate is a key financing instrument for banks and the Bundesbank's favored tool for steering West German money-market rates.    In London, the timing of the U.S. rate increase, coming just one day after British banks raised their base rates by 1/2 point, was regarded more by analysts as a coincidence than a coordinated move. While both increases had been expected because of the need to slow economic growth in the U.S. and Britain, neither had been expected quite so soon.    Treasury officials and the Bank of England declined to comment on the U.S. move, part of normal procedure of not commenting on other countries' policies or future changes in U.K. interest rates. Senior U.K. monetary officials have attributed recent rises in Britain's base interest rates, including the latest increase, primarily to domestic inflation fears.    While U.K. economists are expecting further boosts in base rates, they said the increases probably wouldn't come until this fall. </TEXT></DOC>
