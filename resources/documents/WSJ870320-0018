It is all those liberals in government who are ruining his country.    &quot;They're giving away South Africa,&quot; fumes Mr. Lemmer. &quot;Everyone is pushing them around. That's the way it is with liberals, you know.&quot;    Many words have been used in many places to describe the government of President P.W. Botha, but liberal usually isn't one of them. To most of the outside world, Mr. Botha is a stubborn hard-liner, resolutely resisting the forces of change that are wrenching his country. But in some parts of South Africa, mainly the rural ones, Mr. Botha and his National Party are despised as weak-kneed liberals who have backtracked too far on the principles of apartheid and surrendered too much to those pushing for black majority rule.    The intensity of these right-wing feelings here is an indication of the deepening polarization within South African society. The political and emotional divide has always been great between the various color groups, but it is now widening even among the whites. As the May 6 white election nears, ideological unrest is raging on both the right and the left.    Here, in the shadow of the Soutpansbergs, the view of Mr. Botha is particularly harsh. The white farmers, the Boers who once were the backbone of National Party support, have become as unforgiving as the cruel weather. Many of them now pledge their allegiance to the Conservative Party, which campaigns under the slogan &quot;Stop inflation, reject integration, save the nation.&quot;    Such rhetoric, aimed at the Afrikaner heart, is finding an easy mark here in the northernmost corner of South Africa, where international sanctions and the domestic recession are making it even harder than usual to eke out a living from the parched soil. The farms are plagued by all manner of predators, the worst being the anti-apartheid terrorists who slip across the Limpopo by night, leaving land mines and taking cattle.    The farmers are convinced that the forces of black-majority rule, which turned neighboring Rhodesia into Zimbabwe in 1980, are camped literally at their doorsteps, ready to storm South Africa and wipe out everything they have achieved.    &quot;A black man has never ruled a country and can't rule a country. The same will be proven here,&quot; says Mr. Lemmer. He's in a particularly bitter mood these days: Last year, 25 head of cattle were stolen by raiders from across the border; later, he sold off the rest of his stock as the drought persisted. Gesturing north toward the country he still calls Rhodesia, he adds, &quot;The blacks over there are starving. P.W. Botha talks about power-sharing, but it will end up like over there.&quot;    Thomas Langley, the area's Conservative Party member of parliament, whose farm is a long stretch of dirt road away from Mr. Lemmer's, says his constituents are &quot;strong-minded people who know what they want.&quot; And that, he says, is a government that will put the blacks in their place and reassert South Africa's interests abroad.    Such harsh views bother Pieter Vorster, the National Party organizer in the Soutpansberg constituency. &quot;This is a crucial time in our history, for the Afrikaners are divided as never before,&quot; Mr. Vorster says. &quot;Here, we're battling the right. The Conservatives are fanatics. They are always the rebellious ones, against any change no matter what it is.&quot;    The Conservatives' rebellion began in 1982, when they split from the National Party and formed their own political movement. This revolt shattered the Afrikaner power monolith that ruled the country since 1948, opening a way for the unabashed expression of Afrikaner nationalism.    As South Africa's racial conflict intensified, support mushroomed for the new pro-apartheid Conservative Party, as well as for the Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging, an extreme right-wing group dedicated to preserving white domination.    Today, the Conservative Party claims about 15% to 20% of the white electorate and holds 18 seats in the 177-seat parliament. Its influence on the government, however, is much greater than its size would indicate, political analysts say.    &quot;The government knows that it can't leave these people behind. After all, they are all Afrikaners,&quot; explains a former South African diplomat who now runs a private business. &quot;P.W. Botha won't move forward without the right wing.&quot;    As a result, the National Party has put the brakes on its cautious program -- initially designed to appease the country's liberals -- of dismantling some aspects of apartheid. The state president and top cabinet officials have become more bellicose, belittling domestic opponents and threatening foreign ones. The government imposed its state of emergency last June partially to satisfy right-wing demands. And it called an election for May 6 in the hope of recapturing the conservative ground.    In so doing, the National Party touched off a wave of left-wing dissension that is causing some of the more enlightened Afrikaners to defect to the campaigns of independents or candidates of the liberal-minded Progressive Federal Party. And on the right, the government's tough talk is being drowned out by the even tougher talk of the Conservatives. Although the National Party is in little danger of losing its big parliamentary majority, it most likely won't get the resounding endorsement it is seeking.    &quot;The National Party is trying to do the impossible by appealing to the right and appeasing the left,&quot; says Connie Mulder, a leading member of the Conservative Party. &quot;But a middle-of-the-road party never succeeds in South Africa.&quot;    Which is why the Conservatives are steering far to the right. No attempt is made to hide their support of grand apartheid, as they loudly advocate a &quot;partition&quot; scheme which would put each of the black tribes in a designated area where they could rule themselves. Nor do they try to hedge their deep conviction that the Afrikaner identity must be defended at all costs, even if it means bloodshed.    &quot;Integrated power-sharing is suicide and that is why it's out for whites,&quot; says Mr. Langley.    At his headquarters in Louis Trichardt, the biggest town in the constituency, there is an atmoshpere of urgency. Koeks Terreblanche, the Conservative Party campaign organizer, says the National Party is leading the country into a future of one-man, one-vote, and must be stopped -- quickly. &quot;Time is short,&quot; he says.    At the religious video shop directly below the Conservative Party offices, a similar message is heard -- this one urging sinners to repent before it's too late. The store is filled with tapes of Jimmy Swaggart, the American television evangelist who preaches that old-time religious values are the only road to salvation.    &quot;Mr. Swaggart is very popular here, particularly with the Afrikaners,&quot; says Elma van Niekirk, the shopkeeper. &quot;He doesn't beat around the bush like the liberals. He goes straight to the heart.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
