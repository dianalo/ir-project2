In former backwaters of banking, such as Charlotte, N.C.; Columbus, Ohio, and Providence, R.I., a new breed of banks, called superregionals, is reshaping the financial landscape.    Based in economically strong regions, growing in size and profitability -- and, unlike their big-city cousins, unburdened by the Latin American loan albatross -- superregionals have become banking's financial stars. Over the next few years, many bankers and analysts predict, some superregionals will charge into the lists of the nation's largest banks and compete nationally with money-center institutions for consumer and mid-sized business accounts.    &quot;A very different array of top banks&quot; seems likely to develop, says George J. Vojta, executive vice president of Bankers Trust New York Corp.    The superregionals' surge has been sparked by recent state laws permitting banks within certain multistate areas to operate across state lines. That privilege -- denied to money-center banks -- has triggered a wave of regional mergers. And the repercussions are rippling through states such as Maine and Florida, where an influx of out-of-state banks and thrift institutions has bid up interest rates on deposits and sharpened competition for corporate accounts.    But banking customers' gains from the sharper competition may fade.    &quot;We'll see much the same thing that has happened with airline deregulation -- price cutting followed by consolidation and higher prices,&quot; says James Wooden, a Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. analyst, who adds: &quot;But we're a long, long way from that.&quot;    Four major banking regions are taking shape, with less than half a dozen banks or thrifts moving to dominate the market in each of them:    In New England, the leading superregionals include Providence-based Fleet Financial Group Inc. and Boston-based Bank of New England Corp. and Bank of Boston Corp. In the Southeast: SunTrust Banks Inc. of Atlanta and three Charlotte-based institutions -- First Union Corp., NCNB Inc. and First Wachovia Corp. On the West Coast: Wells Fargo Co. and First Nationwide Savings, both based in San Francisco -- home turf of BankAmerica Corp., the nation's third-largest commercial bank -- and Los Angeles-based First Interstate Bancorp and Great Western Financial Corp. And in a broad expanse stretching from the Middle Atlantic states to the Midwest: Banc One Corp., in Columbus, Ohio; NBD Bancorp in Detroit and PNC Financial Corp. of Pittsburgh.    However, the superregionals face several looming problems, some bankers and analysts say. As in the past, an economic slump could spoil the party. Many of today's superregionals flirted with disaster when their real-estate loans soured during the mid-1970s. Two budding Texas superregionals of the early 1980s -- InterFirst and Texas Commerce Bancshares -- were so weakened by the depression in the oil and natural-gas industry that they had to be taken over.    Moreover, money-center banks, which now compete head-to-head with superregionals chiefly on just credit cards and mortgages, are increasingly soliciting medium-sized business customers, the superregionals' bread and butter. These are customers that New York giants such as Chemical New York Corp. and Manufacturers Hanover Corp. once passed over in favor of more prestigious but less profitable dealings with large corporations. And by acquiring ailing thrifts and banks in Florida, Texas and elsewhere, institutions such as Citicorp and Chemical also are trying to wrest consumer business from superregionals.    Money-center bankers, in turn, generally decline to comment publicly on the competitive threat posed by superregionals, though privately they acknowledge concern. And there's no denying the superregionals' growth. From 1975 to 1985, the nation's 100 largest banks lifted their share of the industry's assets from 50% to 57.7%, but Donald Savage, a Federal Reserve Board economist, says, &quot;It's not the money centers that are doing the acquiring, but the regionals.&quot; The asset share of the 10 biggest banks didn't change.    Moreover, the market value of some superregionals' stocks exceeds that of many money-center banks with greater assets. For example, Pittsburgh's PNC Financial, Charlotte's First Union and Atlanta's SunTrust rank among the nation's 10 largest banks in market capitalization, higher than BankAmerica or Manufacturers Hanover.    Money-center banks gave the superregionals an opening by slipping into the morass in Latin America. They lent billions of dollars there after many of their big-company customers learned in the early 1980s to borrow more cheaply by issuing commercial paper -- their own short-term debt. But the attempt to compensate for the lost business went awry as stagnant economies pushed Brazil and other developing countries to suspend interest payments or reschedule debts. Big banks already have set aside more than $15 billion in reserves for possible losses on these loans, and many of them will post deficits for this year.    The upshot: The money-center banks have been weakened just as the doors to regional banking were swung open by a 1985 Supreme Court decision upholding regional banking compacts.    &quot;The theme of the money centers' expansion strategy has been, today the world, tomorrow the U.S.,&quot; says Alex Sheshunoff, a bank consultant based in Austin, Texas. &quot;The only trouble is that the foreign-debt dilemma has now put a crimp in those plans.&quot;    Meanwhile, the superregionals have been twice blessed. Strong economies in the West, Northeast and Southeast have kept their deposits growing and loan quality generally good. And consumer banking and lending to businesses with $50 million to $250 million in sales has been very profitable.    Edward E. Crutchfield Jr., the chief executive of Charlotte-based First Union, says banks such as his have &quot;hothouse conditions going for them. It looks as though nothing stands in the superregionals' way.&quot;    Mr. Sheshunoff says the strength of certain regional economies explains why some regional banks have become superregionals. &quot;Part of it is luck,&quot; he says. Noting the once-booming Texas economy, he adds: &quot;If you had had interstate banking back in 1981, you would have a lot of bankers across the nation reporting to Houston today.&quot;    Now, superregionals face the challenge of pushing expansion without compromising earnings. Already, some analysts question whether superregional executives are too caught up with geographic expansion&quot;putting pins in a map,&quot; as one analyst describes it.    In their haste to expand, many superregionals are significantly diluting per-share earnings without formulating plans to recoup the drain, Christoph Kotowski of Oppenheimer andamp; Co. says. &quot;You ask some of these bank chairmen why they were willing to pay so much for some of these banks, and they say, 'That's what it took to get the franchise,'&quot; Mr. Kotowski says. &quot;I'm not opposed to banks making acquisitions that are dilutive if they have a strategy for earning it back. But most banks haven't done that.&quot;    He adds: &quot;If you reach the point that your earnings per share are never going to grow as a result of a merger, what's the point of the merger? I don't care how good the franchise is. My question is: Does it accelerate earnings-per-share growth?&quot;    Mr. Kotowski criticizes the pending merger involving Rainier Banks Inc. of Seattle. An unsuccessful suitor, First Bank System Inc. of Minneapolis, was willing to dilute its shareholders' earnings 15% to 16% to acquire Rainier. Ultimately, Rainier chose to go with Security Pacific Corp. for $1.1 billion, a price that diluted Security's earnings about 12%. In both proposals, Mr. Kotowski considers the dilution excessive.    John F. Kooken, Security Pacific's vice chairman and chief financial officer, acknowledges that the bank would have preferred a less dilutive purchase. But he says Security Pacific acquired the premier bank in the Northwest and will recoup the dilution within three years through the sale of redundant operations and more efficient use of computer systems.    Mergers needn't hobble banks. In the 1986 acquisition of Chicago-based USAmeribancs Inc., Detroit-based NBD Bancorp paid a steep $250 million-about three times USAmeribancs' book value -- but Mr. Kotowski says NBD identified possible cost savings that should quickly recoup the premium it paid. For example, instead of having the Electronic Data Systems subsidiary of General Motors Corp. handle USAmeribancs' data-processing needs, NBD will do it.    Some superregionals concede that they will be hard pressed financially to digest their acquisitions and maintain customer relations in newly entered areas. But Terrence Murray, chairman of Fleet Financial, whose proposed merger with Norstar Bancorp. of Albany, N.Y., would create the nation's 21st-largest bank holding company, explains:    &quot;The window of opportunity for the creation of superregional banks might not be open long. Then, we will face the challenge of consolidating our positions. It's going to be tough. What has distinguished us is that our returns on assets and equity are far above average. Maintaining those levels, that's going to be the challenge.&quot;    Harold Pote Jr., the chief executive of Philadelphia-based Fidelcor Inc., which has an interstate merger pending, adds: &quot;There are few truly 'hands-off' mergers. Yet in customer relations, a bank has to manage itself as a small, local institution. It's hard to do.&quot;    Some acquisitions have been handled poorly. After Pittsburgh-based Mellon Bank acquired Philadelphia-based Girard Bank in 1982, Mellon rankled local feelings by changing Girard's name to Mellon East and lost what some consider Girard's best employees. In addition, Mellon saddled itself with Girard's many problem loans.    Though conceding the loss of some top people, a Mellon spokeswoman terms the number &quot;vastly overstated&quot; and adds that many Girard employees have risen in the organization. She adds that the price Mellon paid for Girard reflected its problem loans.    The specter of hidden loan problems worries some analysts. Oppenheimer's Mr. Kotowski wonders how thoroughly acquirers have scrutinized loan portfolios, particularly construction loans to developers. In areas beyond the already-troubled Southwest, &quot;I have a feeling that realestate loans are going to be the next problem area,&quot; he says.    For now, such worries seem remote. Superregionals' earnings don't show any signs of ebbing, and the pace of mergers seems likely to quicken as more barriers to interstate banking fall.    &quot;We already can see how the contours of the banking landscape will change,&quot; says Stuart Greenbaum, a finance professor at Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Business. &quot;We're still in the early stages, and we have massive consolidation ahead of us. There's no question about the significance of the superregionals. They'll provide a new generation of leaders for the banking business.&quot;    ---                Major Superregional Banks   Ranked by holding company total assets, as of June 30,1987.
