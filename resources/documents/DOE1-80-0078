For this we installed two different photondetection systems for monitoring the stepwise decrease in the photonflux as the number of stored electrons is reduced one by one. The performancesof a photon counter, accepting a large solid angle of the visible andnear-UV synchrotron radiation, and an array of photodiodes, sensitivemostly in the soft X-ray region, were investigated for different operationalconditions of the storage ring. With a computerized data analysis routinelyup to 1000 electrons are counted unambiguously allowing the determinationof electron currents up to 0.77 nA with an uncertainty of 3x10/sup -7/of the measured current.</TEXT></DOC>
