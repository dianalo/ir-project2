DOYLE</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A former federal judge, a former Wall Streetprosecutor and a labor lawyer were appointed today to overseeoperations of the Teamsters union as part of the settlement ofcivil racketeering charges against the 1.6 million-member union.   The three are: Frederick B. Lacey, a former federal judge andU.S. attorney in New Jersey; Charles M. Carberry, former head ofthe commodities and securities fraud unit of the U.S. attorney'soffice in Manhattan; and Michael H. Holland, a Chicago lawyer andformer general counsel to the United Mine Workers of America.   Lacey, the administrative officer, and Holland, who will overseeunion elections, were sworn in today by U.S. District Judge DavidN. Edelstein, who approved the out-of-court settlement in March.   Carberry, who will investigate alleged corruption, will be swornin later, said the judge.   The three will have the authority to investigate and arbitratealleged corruption and oversee elections until late 1992.   Describing the three watchdogs, Edelstein said: ``Their ability,dedication and integrity cannot be questioned.''   The three posts were created as part of a settlement of thegovernment's civil lawsuit against the International Brotherhood ofTeamsters, Chauffeurs and Warehousemen, the nation's largest tradeunion.   The law suit, filed under the civil aspects of the RacketeerInfluenced Corrupt Organizations (RICO) act, charged that the topleadership of the union was dominated by organized crime.   The agreement, reached just hours before the case was to go totrial, also called for the direct election of internationalofficers by the rank and file.   In exchange, Teamsters leaders, whom the government sought tooust, were allowed to remain in office.</TEXT></DOC>
