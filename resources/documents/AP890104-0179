A Palestinian man was shot dead in Jericho in the occupied WestBank, but it was not clear whether the killing was connected withthe 13-month-old uprising in the occupied territories.   Conferences are planned in Paris and the Hague later this monthdespite Israeli laws that prohibit meetings with the PalestineLiberation Organization.   A Palestinian newspaper and Israeli magazine announced plansWednesday for a similar meeting in New York in March, to whichmembers of Israel's parliament and the Palestine National Council,the PLO legislature, would be invited.   In the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, soldiers opened fireduring at least four clashes with stone-throwing youths, accordingto Arab reports and hospital officials.   Nasser Ismail Nasser, 16, was killed In Gaza's Deir el Balahrefugee camp, officials at Ahli Arab hospital in Gaza City said. Thearmy confirmed Nasser's death, which brought to 346 the number ofPalestinians killed in the rebellion. Fourteen Israelis also havedied.   In Jericho, 25-year-old Bassam Barahme was killed by unidentifiedgunmen near his home Wednesday night, army officials and Israelradio reported.   Barahme was taken to Mukassad Hospital in Arab east Jerusalem anddied of two bullet wounds, the radio said.   The reason for the attack was not known. A military officialsaid: ``Troops were not involved. It was a clash between residents.''   The uprising has been credited with bringing about a moremoderate stance by PLO chairman Yasser Arafat that has, in turn,encouraged some Israelis to press for a talks with the PLO.   Arafat said Wednesday his peace overtures to Israel would bewithdrawn unless it agreed to negotiate.   ``I don't expect Israel to accept peace easily or to give ineasily,'' he said during a rally in Cairo after a meeting withPresident Hosni Mubarak of Egype.   But if Israel continues to spurn talks, ``I will return to thePalestine National Council and tell them: it's no use, these people(Israelis) do not want peace.''   In Jerusalem, Lova Eliav of Israel's mainstream Labor Party saidWednesday that he and five other Israeli politicians would attendthe meetings with PLO officials.   ``I think the Israeli government must negotiate with the PLO andthe meetings in The Hague and Paris can be a catalyst for futuremeetings,'' he said.   Organizers of the Hague meeting said they believed the PLO wouldbe represented by two top officials, Bassam Abu Sharif and Khaled AlHassan.   Eliav said he and and fellow Labor Party member Ora Namir wouldgo to Paris, along with Yair Tsaban of the socialist Mapam Party andShulamit Aloni of the left-wing Citizens Rights Movement. All aremembers of Israel's parliament.   He said Abba Eban, a former Labor foreign minister, and HaimTzadok, a former Supreme Court justice, would attend the Haguemeeting.   The Hebrew-language Hadashot newspaper also reported anunidentified Labor legislator was trying to arrange a meeting withArafat in Paris.   Meanwhile, Palestinian editor Hanna Seniora said his PLO-backednewspaper Al Fajr and the Israeli magazine New Outlook would sponsora meeting March 18-20 in New York to bring Palestinians and Israelistogether.   After Arafat said Dec. 14 in Geneva that the PLO recognizedIsrael's right to exist and renounced terrorism, the United Statesopened meetings with the PLO. But Israeli officials continue todenounce Arafat's organization as a terrorist group.   A Foreign Ministry spokesman said Wednesday that the ministryasked Israeli legislators not to attend the meetings. A group of 31right-wing and religious party lawmakers also asked governmentofficials to legally block those going to Paris from leaving Israel.   An army official said the military was investigating the death ofan 11-year-old Palestinian who, family members charge, suffered afatal head injury when he was pushed off a military jeep on Dec. 10.   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said there wasno evidence that the boy, Badr Karadeh of Nablus, was ever inmilitary custody.   But a Palestinian physician, Dr. Abdel Hadi Abu Zant of Nablus,said he saw the boy seized, beaten and taken away by Israelisoldiers in a jeep.   Two left-wing members of parliament _ Dedi Zucker and Yossi Saridof the Citizens Rights Movement _ have called for a Defense Ministryprobe.   In another development, Mayor Elias Freij of the West Bank townof Bethlehem, who proposed a truce in the uprising, appeared to bein hiding Wednesday after a warning from Arafat and death threatspainted on the town walls.   Freij had proposed conditions under which Israel would free 5,000Palestinian prisoners, allow universities to open, and holdmunicipal elections for the first time in 12 years.   Arafat, in remarks broadcast Monday, said, ``No one can stop theintefadeh, and any responsible Palestinian calling for stopping itexposes himself to the bullets of our people.''</TEXT></DOC>
