It's just always been thatway.&quot; He will know, of course, that a quote of 4 1/8 meansfour dollars and 12 1/2 cents. The thing is, he can't explainthe half-penny.   Why does the stock market use eighths when the rest of thebusiness world uses tenths?</LP><TEXT>   &quot;Probably to keep out the riffraff,&quot; grumbles one younginvestor. &quot;Using eighths is confusing.&quot;   A look at history suggests two less emotionalpossibilities.   First, the American colonies had very little money:England didn't furnish coins and wouldn't allow the coloniesto make their own. Paper currency was almost nil. Therefore,the colonists had no choice but to trade in Indian wampum,beaver pelts, grain, musket balls -- and some foreign coins.   The principal coin used was the Spanish milled dollar andits fractional parts. This silver coin was known also as thepillar dollar or piece of eight. Its fractional parts werecalled reales, or bits, and each had a value of a 12 1/2cents. The coin could be cut and used in its smallersegments. In fact, our modern quarter still is known as &quot;twobits.&quot; These coins continued to be a popular and sanctionedcurrency until an act in 1857 repealed the use of foreigncoins and retired the Spanish dollar from circulation.   We're not certain when the New York securities marketbegan, or what coinage was used at the time. It is believedthat a few securities were traded as early as 1725 whenwheat, tobacco and even slaves were traded at auction at thefoot of Wall Street. If this is the case, it's reasonable tobelieve that the Spanish dollar and its fractional eighthsmay have played a part in the transactions. But since norecords were kept, we can't be certain which &quot;monies&quot; wereused -- perhaps the Spanish dollar, or maybe only animalskins and beads.   There is a second possibility.   Some believe that the use of eighths did not originateuntil the 1790s, when America's trading was conducted inBritish shillings and pence. These coins had an approximatevalue of one quarter of a dollar (25 cents) to the shilling,and one eighth of a dollar (12 1/2 cents) to the six-pence.Are there records to support this theory?   Although the first mention of market securities was seenin 1792 -- when Louden's Register announced briefly thatstock dealers were meeting each noon at 22 Wall Street -- theearliest records of market transactions were not seen until1818. It was then that brokers began to organize formally.They set up a constitution, elected officers, establishedrules and introduced a commission of 0.25% to 0.5%. (Theinitiation fee, incidentally, was $25.) From this time,records were kept on a fairly regular basis, and they showclearly that trading in 1818 was in eighths and quarters.   However, remember those several securities already tradingat the foot of Wall Street as early as 1725? Did brokers --or, more accurately, merchants and auctioneers -- use theSpanish dollar then, even though volume was almostnonexistent? Or did the eighth not surface until later, whentrading picked up, and when dealing was in British shillings?There's no clear answer. We can only speculate.   Regardless of how the eighth began, many of us wonder whyit doesn't end. Can't Wall Street convert to the tenth andoperate like other businesses? Wouldn't life be easier?   Probably not. For one thing, the conversion itself wouldbe enormously expensive and complicated. It would requirechanges in all stock exchanges world-wide: changes inequipment, brokers' lists, records. Even with the help ofcomputer technology, such a change would spell trouble on amassive scale.   Also, think of the private investor who, long accustomedto the eighth, would suddenly find his records and methods nolonger in sync with the system. A nasty jolt, especiallyalongside the confusion already generated annually andbountifully by the IRS.   In short, any advantage in converting seems not worth theprice. So, regardless of who bequeathed us the half-penny,and as archaic as the &quot;bit&quot; may be, it seems here to stay.   ---   Ms. Thompson is a free-lance writer living in Ann Arbor,Mich.</TEXT></DOC>
