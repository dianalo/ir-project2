Answering reporters questions as he and Reagan began a meetingat the former president's office here, Bush said he wanted to keepReagan ``fully informed'' about world events.   The president also said that in his talks with some 35 worldleaders since taking office last Jan. 20, he has found that ``therespect for him (Reagan) around the world knows no bounds.''   ``I hope I can talk him into various missions and assignments astime goes by,'' Bush said as he sat next to the man he served asvice president for eight years.   Reagan said he considers the White House ``in good hands'' asBush nears the 100-day mark of his presidency and that hissuccessor was ``doing fine.''   Bush did not specify what assignments he was considering givingto Reagan, and the former president did not respond to Bush'sstatement about his plan.   But Bush did say that ``I have a lot more to learn fromPresident Reagan, and I learned a lot about principle and the worldas it really is. I wanted to talk to him about change abroad ...get his advice.''   Neither Bush nor Reagan would respond to reporters' questionsabout the Iran-Contra trial of fired White House aide Oliver Northon grounds the matter was still before the courts. ``Here's onewhere I think we're both in the same boat,'' Reagan said.   Reporters had asked Reagan whether he had been aware of WhiteHouse documents that were never seen by the congressionalinvestigative committees.   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Tuesday thatBush has talked by phone to Reagan a few times. Bush, chatting withreporters aboard Air Force One earlier this week, said, ``I don'tever say what I talk to the president about.''   But then Bush did acknowledge he had called Reagan recently todiscuss news reports that quoted Bush aides anonymously as makingdisparaging statements about Reagan. ``I thought an explanation wasin order,'' the president said.   One such story, which had unnamed Bush aides mocking Reagan'slaid-back management style, led White House chief of staff JohnSununu to warn presidential aides against making such statements.   The Bush-Reagan meeting comes at a time when Bush is makinghigh-profile public appearances aimed at restating administrationthemes as Bush nears the 100-day mark of his presidency.   Bush put in a 14-hour day in California Tuesday, giving abusiness-oriented speech at the Ford Aerospace plant in Palo Alto,then visiting a 213-acre ranch in the Orange County hill countrythat had been a drug distribution center.   He was reunited with Hispanic Republican supporters on thecampus of the University of California at Los Angeles and wound upthe day by watching major league baseball's Baltimore Orioles beatthe California Angels 8-1 at Anaheim Stadium.   ``Many of you know the history of the ground we stand on,'' saidBush, as he stood before huge stacks of money _ more than $4million _ seized in the raid that broke up the drug-dealing center.   ``Once a warehouse of death, now it's a source of hope,'' hesaid.   Speaking to the Hispanic audience, Bush noted that he soon wasto meet with ``one of America's greatest presidents. I'm talkingabout California's always-favorite son and my good friend, RonaldReagan.''   The former president and his wife, Nancy, are enjoying theirretirement here, said Reagan spokesman Mark Weinberg. He said theReagans spend a considerable amount of time answering mail and willcontinue to travel and speak.   But the former president has not attracted huge crowds at somepublic speaking engagements, and he recently waived his $50,000honorarium when a smaller-than-expected crowd turned out for aspeech at Arizona State University.   In his more than three months in office, Bush also has distancedhimself from some Reagan policies and has adopted a more energeticpresidential management style.   Bush, though a lifelong member of the National RifleAssociation, has moved to limit the proliferation of assault-typeweapons by imposing a ban on imports of many of these guns.   Unlike Reagan, he moved quickly to strike a bipartisan agreementwith Congress that essentially puts the United States on adiplomatic, rather than military, course, in seeking democraticreforms in Nicaragua.   Bush also has proposed a more far-reaching ethics package andwill likely seek a strengthening of the Clean Water Act, a moreenvironmentalist position than Reagan took.</TEXT></DOC>
