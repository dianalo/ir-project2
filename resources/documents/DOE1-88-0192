The dissertation presents algorithms for calculatingthe forces acting on cross-cutting heads. The algorithms have been integratedin a computer-aided simulation program which can be run both on a theoreticalbasis and on the basis of measured data. The following aspects are discussedin detail: Parameters influencing the cross-cutting forces, theoreticaldetermination of the forces acting on cross-cutting heads, preparationand implementation of the simulation calculation, results and analysis,further analysis, simulation results as a basis for stability calculations.For a given selective cutter with a cross-cutting head and with all parametersknown, the author's method enables a detailed assessment of the cuttingcharacteristics and smoothness of running of the cutting head as wellas of the stability of the selective-cutting heading machine.
