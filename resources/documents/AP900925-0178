Gaviria made the announcement at a news conference in Bogotashortly before leaving for the United Nations.   He said international supervision of a cease-fire is possible``any time the guerrillas halt their kidnappings, taking ofhostages, terrorist attacks and their recruiting of children 15 andyounger.''   ``We are thereby removing any obstacle that might keep rebeliousgroups from adhering to the government's position of peace,''Gaviria said.   There was no immediate response from the two main rebel groupsthat Gaviria's statment was aimed at: the National Liberation Armyand the Colombian Revolutionary Armed Forces.   The groups have been fighting in the mountains and jungles ofColombia for more than 20 years. Their attacks contribute to aclimate of violence that includes murders and kidnappings byright-wing death squads and drug smugglers.   The cease-fire would be the first step toward convincing theguerrillas to disband and form civilian groups to participate inthe country's politics.   A constituent assembly will meet next February to considerproposals to change the country's constitution, including a widerdistribution of power now held mostly by the country's traditionalparties, the Liberals and Conservatives.   The government has said that if guerrillas want to participatein the assembly, they must sign a peace agreement and take stepstoward disbanding.   The guerrillas have been ambushing army patrols and attackingtowns in the last few weeks. On Sept. 5 they blew up the main oilpipeline in the country.   A third major guerrilla group, the April 19 Movement, disbandedlast February in exchange for amnesty and the right to form apolitical party.
