(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Most organizations that use PCs also harbor a Macintosh or two, usuallypurchased because Macs are able to produce superior graphics.andP;  There comes atime, however, when a single project will involve Macs and PCs sharing bothdata and users.andM;Companies that mix Macs and PCs must determine whether the combination issynergy or suicide.andM;A key requirement for successful systems fusion is support from off-the-shelfsoftware applications.andP;  The products reviewed here are Macintosh versions ofleading PC packages, evaluated against the goal of being able to mixMacintoshes with PCs in a single work group.andM;PC Week evaluated a spreadsheet (Excel 2.2), two database managers (dBASE Mac1.01 and FoxBase+/Mac 2.00), two word processors (Microsoft Word 4.0 andWordPerfect 1.0.2) and a desktop-publishing package (PageMaker 3.02).andM;The primary requirement for effectively mixing PCs and Macs is file exchange,using either magnetic media or a network or modem connection.andM;Recent Macintosh models can read PC-format 3-1/2-inch disks directly, andsome Mac peripherals can read 5-1/4-inch disks as well.andP;  Many networkoperating systems can link both types of machine.andM;A problem arises, however, with the MacOS file system, which permits mostMacintosh programs to recognize only certain file types.andM;Of the products tested, Word was the best at recognizing file types by filecontent alone and at interpreting the contents with minimum user effort.andM;FoxBase+/Mac violates Macintosh conventions by relying on the user to assignspecific file-name extensions (such as .DBF for dBASE-format database files).andM;All but one of these products worked efficiently in a mixed-machineenvironment.andP;  The exception is dBASE Mac, which bears no useful resemblanceto its PC namesake (or to any other PC database, for that matter).andM;----------Extensive File-Format SupportandM;ALDUS CORP., PAGEMAKER 3.02, $595andM;PageMaker's documentation clearly states what will be kept and what will belost when users import files from other applications.andP;  Such candor is mostwelcome when compared with the hit-or-miss experimentation that is requiredto import files into most other programs.andM;Version 3.02, for example, supports Microsoft Word 4.0 and some of its newfeatures.andP;  WordPerfect files must have the .WP extension before a successfulimport is possible.andP;  Similar tricks must also be performed on files fromother PC applications before being imported to PageMaker, but they all arewell-documented.andM;Importing PC PageMaker files to its Mac-based version is convenient.andP;  If thefile transfer produces an ASCII file with a hidden type signature of &quot;TEXT,&quot;the user need only add &quot;.PM3&quot; to the file name.andP;  PageMaker will then open itdirectly from the Mac's File/Open menu.andM;However, if the file transfer produces a file type with a signature of&quot;????,&quot; a manual adjustment of the file type will be necessary.andM;Aldus Corp. can be reached in Seattle at (206) 622-5500.andM;Buyers say: Clean file importsandM;&quot;In almost all translations, you're trying to capture all the keystrokes --the formatting doesn't count.andP;  Translation is rarely ever 100 percent,&quot; saidJohn Ronga, systems manager for Electronics Direction Group Ltd., a NewYork-based consulting and training firm specializing in desktop publishing.andM;If the font information is simple, then it works well, he said, but tabwidths don't always translate properly.andM;Another problem occurs, he said, &quot;if I have Bitstream fonts where there isn'tany equivalent on the Mac.&quot; In that case, he has to reformat pages after theyhave been imported to PageMaker.andM;When he imported WordPerfect files into PageMaker, said Ronga, they &quot;cameacross really clean.andP;  The translators are really good.&quot;andM;Incompatibilities AboundandM;ASHTON-TATE, DBASE MAC 1.01, $495andM;dBASE Mac takes an interesting approach to database management, with agraphical interface that lets the user see even complex relational-databasestructures as diagrams on the screen.andP;  Unfortunately, it uses a procedurallanguage that is substantially different from that of dBASE III Plus.andM;Although database files can be transferred between dBASE for the PC and dBASEMac, dBASE Mac applications must be written in their own procedural language.andO;And unlike the PC versions, dBASE Mac stores these applications in the datafiles rather than as separate source files.andP;  Also, the dBASE III Plus memofield is not supported by dBASE Mac.andM;dBASE Mac violates key elements of the Macintosh user interface.andP;  Forexample, it doesn't let the user cancel the process of defining a foreignfile; the program insists that at least one field be defined so that it cancomplete the file creation.andP;  A Macintosh dialogue box without a Cancel buttonis a rare and unwelcome sight.andM;A $795 version of dBASE Mac includes a run-time option for stand-aloneapplications.andM;Ashton-Tate, of Torrance, Calif., can be reached at (213) 329-9989.andM;Buyers say: Hard to import filesandM;&quot;By no stretch of the imagination will I use dBASE on the Mac,&quot; said JohnMurphy, senior staff consultant at Wohl Associates Inc., a softwareconsulting firm in Bala Cynwyd, Pa.andP;  &quot;FoxBase+/Mac seemed to offer betterperformance on the Mac side.&quot;andM;Murphy said dBASE was complicated because it has no direct Mac-to-PCimport/export capability.andM;With dBASE, &quot;there is presently no simple way to go from the PC environmentto the Mac,&quot; he claimed.andM;dBASE Mac did not support all of the commands used in the PC version ofdBASE, said James Goodwin, a programmer in the engineering and scientificdivision of Ford Aerospace Corp. in Palo Alto, Calif.andM;&quot;In the middle of running a [PC-based dBASE application,] dBASE Mac wouldstop and say that it didn't understand this or that command,&quot; he said.andM;Versatile User InterfaceandM;FOX SOFTWARE INC.,andM;FOXBASE+/MAC 2.00, $495andM;For those experienced in both the dBASE programming language and theMacintosh user interface, FoxBase+/Mac incorporates an elegant extension ofthe widely accepted database-programming model.andP;  The manual wasn't neededuntil well into the review, because the program is intuitive to use.andM;FoxBase+/Mac supports the standard dBASE III Plus field types (character,numeric, date, logical and memo) and adds a new field, &quot;picture,&quot; whichsupports standard Macintosh graphics.andP;  With a desk accessory program or apaint program running under MultiFinder, graphics can be entered into picturefields as easily as text can be entered with the keyboard.andM;FoxBase+/Mac does an outstanding job of importing files from the PC.andP;  A trulystartling feature is its automatic emulation of the PC text-only display modewhen running dBASE-language applications developed on the PC.andP;  After loadinga file that has never seen a Mac before, the screen comes up looking like aPC display.andP;  It brings home the impression that, compared with the Mac's, thePC interface screen is ugly.andM;For those who prefer using the command line, Foxbase+/Mac captures andtranscribes all of the user's mouse/menu commands.andP;  The equivalent commandsare held in the (normally hidden) command window, and can be used for directlanguage-level operation.andM;FoxBase+/Mac is also available in optional $695 multiuser and $300royalty-free run-time versions.andM;Fox Software Inc. of Perrysburg, Ohio, can be reached at (419) 874-0162.andM;Buyers say: Runs without a hitchandM;Anthony Amos, technical analyst at the Lyndhurst, N.J., office of Ernst andamp;Young, a Big Eight accounting firm based in New York, said, &quot;We neededinternal accounting information to be available to everyone, so westandardized on Foxbase+/Mac and Excel because the programs were compatibleacross both machines.&quot;andM;The firm's in-house dBASE applications were ported to FoxBase+/Mac and ranwithout a hitch, he reported.andM;Amos considered using dBASE Mac but didn't like it.andP;  &quot;It didn't work anythinglike the PC version.andP;  We saw a big hurdle in training people to use it,&quot; hesaid.andM;Unrivaled SpreadsheetsandM;MICROSOFT CORP., EXCEL 2.2,andM;$395andM;Originally designed for the Mac, Excel was released in a PC version underMicrosoft Windows.andP;  With a graphical user interface on both platforms, Exceldelivers nearly identical operation and compatible data between Mac andMS-DOS systems.andM;Spreadsheets can be shared between PC and Mac with only minor difficulties.andM;When a long Macintosh file name was changed to fit the DOS eight-characterlimit on the PC, graphs suddenly lost their connections to associatedspreadsheets.andP;  Macintosh users in a mixed-machine setting can sparethemselves some aggravation by adopting DOS-style file names.andM;Overall, formatted spreadsheet text, including column widths and fonts, wasproperly preserved during the import process.andM;For users importing files from less capable programs, Excel can save a filein the format in which it was read, even if this means discardingenhancements (such as borders and fonts) that may have been the main reasonfor importing the file in the first place.andP;  Use &quot;Save As,&quot; and confirm thatthe file is being saved in the proper format.andM;Microsoft Corp., of Redmond, Wash., can be reached at (206) 882-8080.andM;Buyers say: Reliable conversionsandM;The PC and Mac versions of Excel are equally easy to use because of the datacompatibility, according to a software consultant for a large insurancecompany based in the Northeast.andP;  A single copy of a file is kept on thecompany's network; users can paste it into Excel &quot;and don't have to worryabout whether to save it in SYLK or something else,&quot; the consultant said.andM;Integration with other software was also a priority.andP;  &quot;We still have some1-2-3 files that are older, and Excel doesn't want to open them, so we run asimple [binary-to-binary] conversion,&quot; he said.andM;In future versions of the product, the software consultant would like thespreadsheet to automatically update linked Microsoft Word text files.andM;Consistently Good PerformerandM;MICROSOFT CORP., WORD 4.0, $395andM;The current PC-based version of Word for the PC is much like Word 1.05 forthe Macintosh, which is now more than two years out of date.andP;  In other words,it leaves much to be desired.andM;Microsoft should make future PC versions look more like the one currentlyavailable for the Mac.andP;  Tabs, tables, styles, headers, footers and otherfeatures are far easier to use in the Macintosh release than in the PCversion.andM;Overall, though, PC-to-Mac file transfers worked well.andP;  But in one otherwisenormal document that was transferred from the PC to the Mac, a file-transfererror resulted in a negative line width and 17-inch line spacing.andP;  Wordcrashed on the Mac when it tried to repaginate.andP;  The product's internalerror-handling capability could be improved.andM;On the positive side, Word's Shift-Open menu command (&quot;Open Any File&quot;) wasbetter than any other product reviewed at interpreting whatever type of fileit found.andP;  MS-DOS-formatted Word and Rich Text Format (RTF) files, forexample, were recognized and imported correctly with no special effort.andM;Buyers say: Watch transfers closelyandM;John Price, senior loss-control consultant for Pacific Compensation InsuranceCo. in San Bruno, Calif., transfers pfs: Professional Write text files from aCompaq portable to the Mac.andM;&quot;We save our documents as Microsoft Word files, and the transfer is very easyand very fast,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;One problem is that we end up with garbage at thetop and bottom of the file.andP;  My secretary has to go in and clean it up.&quot;andM;Nearly all of the text-formatting commands are lost in the translation.andO;&quot;Apparently the only things that translate over are the carriage returns andtabs and some page breaks,&quot; he said.andP;  Once loaded on a Mac, the formattingcommands must be re-entered manually.andM;Tim O'Hara, senior information-center consultant for St. Paul Companies Inc.,andO;an insurance firm in St. Paul, Minn., exchanges files between PC and Macversions of Microsoft Word over a TOPS network.andM;&quot;It has worked out really well.andP;  We don't have to put a Mac file on a diskand bring it over to the XT,&quot; he said.andM;The incompatibilities between different versions of the Mac and PC programsadd an extra step to the process.andP;  &quot;Evidently, you can't convert a 4.0 Macfile [directly] to a 5.0 PC file,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;You have to save it as a 3.0 PCfile or save it to an RTF file.&quot;andM;Mostly Successful but Needs WorkandM;WORDPERFECT CORP., WORDPERFECTandM;1.0.2, $395andM;This product tries to take advantage of the Macintosh way of doing thingswhile also trying to make the DOS user feel at home.andP;  For the most part, theattempt works.andM;WordPerfect/Mac is quite different from Microsoft Word, the de factoword-processing standard for the Mac.andP;  Superscripts and subscripts, forexample, can be set in percentages of base type size and line height forvertical offset, a useful alternative to setting the size and offset inpoints.andP;  In some ways, such as formatting footnotes, WordPerfect/Mac providesusers with less control, however.andM;In one file-import test, WordPerfect/ Mac crashed -- it could not import adocument that had been exported in WordPerfect format by BorlandInternational Inc.'s DOS-based Sprint program.andP;  Importing the same formattedtest document using various other PC-based applications was no problem.andM;As a solution to this problem, WordPerfect/Mac users could benefit frominstalling a resident debugger, such as Apple Computer Inc.'s MacsBugprogram.andM;For import purposes, perhaps the best use of WordPerfect/Mac is a text-onlytransfer: Users can format files on the destination system rather thanattempt to transfer (and then debug) a formatted document.andM;WordPerfect/Mac is headed in the right direction, but it still has a way togo.andM;WordPerfect Corp., of Orem, Utah, can be reached at (800) 225-5000.andM;Buyers say: Could be easierandM;Translating files between the PC and Mac versions of WordPerfect is notalways an easy process, according to Tim Lee, consulting services manager forthe St. Louis office of Price Waterhouse, a Big Eight accounting firm basedin New York.andP;  He ports PC-based text files to the Mac in order to prepareprofessional-quality reports.andM;&quot;The problem when you bring in those files is that you have a hard carriagereturn at the end of each paragraph, and you have to go in and take them outby hand,&quot; he said.andM;When a PC-based text file was imported to the Mac, &quot;footnotes wouldn't comeover properly,&quot; Lee said.andP;  &quot;Instead of being properly numbered, they would bein the regular text.andP;  Then I would go through the document, and cut and pastethem into place.&quot;andM;----------Reviews by Peter Coffee; interviews by Karen Moser; edited by JeffreyFrentzenandM;For the past several years, PC and Macintosh users have been looking overeach other's shoulders and liking the view.andM;Macintosh users saw that the PC provided powerful software-development toolsthat could be used without learning the five volumes of &quot;Inside Macintosh.&quot;andO;PC users noticed that Macintosh software could be learned more quickly andused more creatively.andM;Each group made the same demand to software developers: Deliver the best ofboth platforms.andM;The industry got the message.andP;  Fox Software Inc.'s FoxBase+ and MicrosoftCorp.'s Word and Excel could easily serve as core applications for anybusiness using PCs, Macs or both machines at once.andM;Aldus Corp.'s PageMaker brings publishing services, long done by outsidecompanies at great expense, to the in-house desktop on either type of system.andM;The monolithic standard of MS-DOS applications on processors with Intelarchitectures went down in flames two years ago, when the open-architectureMacintosh II and the OS/2 operating system were announced within a few weeksof each other.andM;The products reviewed here are the phoenix coming out of those ashes: bettertools for use on multiple platforms, solving problems rather than creatingthem.andP;
