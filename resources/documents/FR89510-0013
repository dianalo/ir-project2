In compliance with the requirementsfor periodic review of existing regulations and in response to a petitionfrom the pickle industry, the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) reviewedand proposed to revise the United States Standards for Grades of Pickles.The December 8, 1987, proposed rule would change the U.S. grade standardsfor pickles by: (1) Removing minimum salt requirements; (2) establishing,under ``Types of Pack,'' the ``Refrigerated'' type; (3) changing size designations;(4) reducing or eliminating the analytical requirements for acid, sugar,or salt for some types of pack; (5) eliminating the ``length variation''in determining uniformity of size for whole style; (6) expanding the tablefor sizes of whole pickles in gallon containers to include other containersizes; (7) increasing the allowance for stems by changing the classifications;(8) simplifying the U.S. grade standards by condensing the various tables;(9) replacing dual grade nomenclature with single letter grade designations;and (10) incorporating minor editorial changes. This modification proposesto require the continued use of vinegar as the sole acidic agent in picklingsolutions. In addition, non-substantive changes to the original proposedrule are made for the sake of clarity. The effect of this proposed rulewould be to improve the standards and encourage uniformity in commercialpractices which would facilitate the trading of pickles.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATE: </T2>Comments must be received on or before July 10, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESS: </T2>Interested persons are invited to submit written commentsconcerning this proposal.

It will not result in an annual effect on the economyof $100 million or more. There will be no major increase in cost or prices for consumers; individualindustries; Federal, State, or local government agencies; or geographicregions. It will not result in significant effects on competition, employment,investments, productivity, innovations, or the ability of United States-basedenterprises to compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or exportmarkets.Agencies are required to periodically review existing regulations. An objectiveof the regulatory review is to ensure that the grade standards are servingtheir intended purpose, the language is clear, and the standards are consistentwith AMS policy and authority.The Administrator, Agricultural Marketing Service, has certified that thisaction will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial numberof small entities, as defined in the Regulatory Flexibility Act, (5 U.S.C.601 et seq.), because it reflects current marketing practices. In additionthese standards are voluntary. A small entity may avoid incurring any additionaleconomic impact by not applying for an inspection.The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) received a petitionfrom Pickle Packers International, Incorporated (PPI), a trade associationof the pickle industry, requesting changes in the United States Standardsfor Grades of Pickles. The PPI requested these changes to reflect procedural,processing, and marketing changes in the pickle industry during the lastthirty years. In addition, AMS conducted a market survey for pickles distributingit to several associations and industry members.The U.S. grade standards for pickles were last revised, except for minorchanges, in 1954. Consumer patterns have indicated preferences for foodscontaining lower levels of sodium. In response to these preferences, thepickle industry is producing lower-salt pickles. The proposed standardswould permit lower-salt pickles to receive a higher grade by eliminatingthe minimum salt requirements in the standards. During the last decade,a new type of pickles known as ``Refrigerated Type'' has become popularamong American consumers. The industry has requested a revision of thegrade standards to include this type of pack.PPI has also requested that the requirements in the grade standards forsalt, acid, and Baume' (density) levels be changed to meet consumer preferencesfor a milder pickle, both in terms of salinity and acidity. The pickleindustry has expressed concern about the public health aspects of sodiumand has responded to consumer preference for reduced sodium levels in foods.In review of the pickle industry, there is no reason to require that picklescontain the minimum salt, and there is a need to allow for production ofpickles containing as little sodium as is technologically feasible.The pickle industry believes the acid level should also be minimal butshould be sufficient to achieve an equilibrated pH of 4.6 or below as requiredby the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Good Manufacturing Practicesfor acidified foods. PPI proposed Baume' levels should also be reducedsince the components which affect Baume' (salt, acid, and sugar) are balancedby each manufacturer to maintain the desired characteristics for tasteand flavor. These changes are reflected in Table V of the proposed standards.PPI states that in most modern pickle processing plants, pickles are beingsized solely by diameter rather than by length and diameter. Hand sortingpickles by length is not economically feasible and would add to processingcosts. Data indicate that pickles are being marketed efficiently withouthand sorting by length and therefore ``length'' should not be part of thecriteria for determining uniformity of size. PPI also requested that thetable designating sizes for whole pickles in gallon containers be expandedto include other common containers sizes.PPI also recommended that stems not be considered a defect in these U.S.grade standards, citing that stems are not listed as a defect in the USDAgrade standards for fresh cucumbers. Presently, the PPI states, the industrymakes no effort to remove stems from cucumbers except when preparing picklesfor acceptance by the military of the school lunch program. PPI statedthat one member, in reviewing complaint letters dating back 10 years, foundno letters concerning attached stems affecting the quality of pickles.They also claim that, with the advent of mechanical harvesting, a restrictiverequirement on stems is not economical and places an unreasonable burdenon the processor. According to data reviewed by the USDA, consumer demandfor pickles has been increasing over the last five years even though mostprocessors are not attempting to remove stems. Current standards requirestems longer than three-eighths of an inch to be scored as a defect.In reviewing this request, the USDA has determined that stems are a defectand affect the appearance and eating quality when they exceed a specifiedlength. For this reason, the USDA proposes that stems of 2.5 centimeters(.98 inch) in length be considered a minor defect. Stems that are 2.5 centimetersor less in length would be considered ``insignificant'' for the purposesof these grade standards.A proposal to revise the U.S. Standards for Grades of Pickles was publishedin the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on December 8, 1987 (52 FR 46486). An extensionof the comment period was published on March 9, 1988 to allow for commentsto be received on or before April 7, 1988.Six comments were received regarding the proposal to revise the U.S. gradestandards. Five comments were from vinegar manufacturers and one commentwas from the Vinegar Institute which represents the vinegar industry. Thecomments were critical of the substitution of the term, ``acidic solution''for the term ``vinegar solution'' throughout the proposal. The VinegarInstitute cited the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) Compliance PolicyGuide 7120.11 stating that FDA policy provides that ``Acetic acid shouldnot be substituted for vinegar in pickled products which consumers customarilyexpect to be prepaed with vinegar''. A 1984 letter from the Food Safetyand Inspection Service, USDA to the commenter also was cited in supportof their position. However, FDA published a regulation in 21 CFR 114.3(b),regarding acidified foods, that we believe could be subject to a contraryinterpretation. The FDA also published as an Advanced Notice of ProposedRulemaking, the international Codex Standards for Pickles permitting theuse of food grade acids. The USDA therefore requested a clarification fromFDA regarding its policy for the use of approved food grade acid as analternative to vinegar.In a letter dated July 28, 1988 and sent to USDA from the Deputy Director,Division of Regulatory Guidance, Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition,Food and Drug Administration, FDA confirmed its policy that only vinegarmay be used in producing pickles and pickled foods and recommended thatthe phrase ``packed in a vinegar solution'' replace the terms ``acid mediumsolution'', ``acidic solution'', and ``other food grade acids'' as writtenin the December 8, 1987 USDA proposed rule. FDA cited a paper publishedin the Journal of Food Science which differentiated between the characteristicsof vinegar and glacial acetic acid. Aqueous solutions of glacial aceticacid were found to have a sharp unpleasant taste. The characteristic flavorsof vinegar were found to be dependent on the constituents formed duringthe fermentation of the raw materials as well as subsequent acetous fermentation.FDA also provided additional recommendations for clarity which have merit.In andSection; 52.1683(a), the modification specifies that cured-type picklesare fermented in salt brine. In andSection; 52.1685(a)(2), the modificationclarifies that the instrument used to determine Brix value is a sugar scaleBrix hydrometer. The heading in Table IV is modified to specify containervolume, and ``large seeds, detached seeds, and tough skins'' are addedas texture defects in Tables VI, VII, and VIII. In view of this, USDA hasdetermined that reproposal of these U.S. grade standards for pickles basedon a vinegar solution as the packing medium is well founded. The term ``vinegarsolution'' has been used to replace ``acid medium solution'' and ``otherfood grade acids'' throughout the entire proposal.For the reasons outlined above, a modified proposal of the revision ofthe U.S. grade standards for pickles is being published to offer interestedparties the opportunity to comment.The modified proposed rule follows a uniform format consistent with recentrevisions of other U.S. grade standards. The proposed format is designedto provide industry personnel and USDA Agricultural Commodity Graders withsimpler and more comprehensive standards. Definitions of terms and easy-to-readtables replace, where appropriate, some of the textual description in existingstandards.These changes would promote better understanding and more uniform applicationof the standards. Modifications to appropriate sections of the currentstandards have been proposed to conform with these changes.As was proposed, this modified proposal also replaces dual grade nomenclaturewith single letter designations. Under this proposal, ``U.S. Grade A''(or U.S. Fancy) and ``U.S. Grade B'' (or U.S. Extra Standard) become ``U.S.Grade A'' and ``U.S. Grade B'' respectively.After reviewing all the information, the USDA has determined that thisproposed rule would facilitate trade between processors and buyers andimprove the marketing of pickles. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 7 CFR Part 52</ITAG>Fruits, Vegetables, Food grades and standards.For the reasons set forth in the preamble, it is proposed that 7 CFR Part52 is amended as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 52_[AMENDED]</ITAG>1.

(d)<T3> Crooked pickles</T3> mean whole pickles that are curved at an anglegreater than 60 degrees as illustrated by the following:<G/><ITAG tagnum="91">insert illus, 146A</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="92"/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Also see the definition of misshapen.(e)<T3> Curved pickles</T3> mean whole pickles that are curved at an angleof 35 to 60 degrees when measured as illustrated by the following: <G/><ITAG tagnum="91">insert illus, 146B</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="92"/>(f)<T3> Diameter</T3> in whole style means the shortest diameter measuredtransversely to the longitudinal axis at the greatest circumference ofthe pickle. Diameter in cross-cut style is the shortest diameter of thelargest cut surface. (g)<T3> Defect</T3> means an imperfection such as curved, misshapen, mechanicallydamaged, discolored, and other imperfection that affects the appearanceof edibility of the product. (h)<T3> End cut</T3> means a pickle unit intended for crosscut (sliced crosswise)style that has only one cut surface. (i)<T3> Extraneous Vegetable Material (EVM)</T3> means any harmless vegetablematerial, other than stems, that is not normally part of the pickle ingredient.EVM such as leaves or other vegetable material not associated with properpickle preparation or packaging is considered a defect if it affects theappearance or edibility of the product either:(1)<T3> Slightly</T3>_Practically free of EVM and does not more than slightlyaffect the appearance or edibility; or (2)<T3> Materially</T3>_Reasonably free of EVM and does not more than materiallyaffect the appearance or edibility. (j)<T3> Flavor and odor</T3>.(1)<T3> Good flavor and odor</T3> means characteristic flavor and odor (e.g,characteristic dill flavor or the like) typical of properly processed pickles,for the type, that is free from objectionable flavor and odor of any kind.(2)<T3> Reasonably good flavor and odor</T3> means flavor and odor that maybe lacking in characteristic flavor for the type but is free from objectionableflavor and odor. (3)<T3> Poor flavor and odor</T3> means flavor and odor that fails to meetthe requirements for reasonably good flavor. (k)<T3> Length</T3> in sliced lengthwise style means the longest measurementat the approximate longitudinal axis. (l)<T3> Mechanical damage</T3> refers to crushed or broken units that affectthe appearance of the units. In relish, mechanical damage refers to unitswhich are poorly cut and have a ragged or torn appearance. (m)<T3> Misshapen pickles</T3> mean whole pickles that are crooked or otherwisedeformed (such as nubbins). Also see the definition for crooked pickles.(n)<T3> Nubbin</T3> is a misshapen pickle that is not cylindrical in form,is short and stubby, or is not well developed.(o)<T3> Texture</T3> means the firmness, crispness, and condition of the picklesand any other vegetable ingredient(s) and freedom from large seeds, detachedseeds, and tough skins that may be present. The following terms also relateto texture: (1)<T3> Hollow centers</T3> in whole style, means the pickles, when cut transverselyto the longitudinal axis, are missing \1/3\ or more of the seed cavity.(2)<T3> Soft, shriveled, and slippery units</T3> refers to pickles that arewrinkled, not crisp, slick, flabby, or lack firmness. (3)<T3> Good texture</T3> means the pickle units have been properly processedand possess a texture that is firm and crisp. (4)<T3> Reasonably good texture</T3> means the pickle units have been properlyprocessed but lack some of the firmness and crispness that is characteristicfor the style and type of pack.(5)<T3> Poor texture</T3> means the pickle units do not meet the requirementsfor reasonably good texture. (p)<T3> Uniformity of size (relish style only)</T3>.(1)<T3> Practically uniform in size</T3> means the size of the units may varymoderately in size but not to the extent that the appearance or the eatingquality is seriously affected. (2)<T3> Poor uniformity of size</T3> means the units fail the requirementsfor practically uniform. (q)<T3> Unit</T3> means one whole, half, slice, or piece of pickle as applicablefor the style. (r)<T3> Units missing \1/3\ or more of the seed cavity</T3> in crosscut stylemeans pickles that have lost a substantial portion of the seed cavity suchas a crosscut unit missing \1/3\ or more of the seed cavity portion. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection;52.1686 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Recommended fill of container. </ITAG>The recommended fill of container is not a factor of quality for the purposesof these grades. Each container of pickles should be filed with pickleingredient, as full as practicable, without impairment of quality. Theproduct and packing medium should occupy not less than 90 percent of thetotal capacity of the container. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection;52.1687 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Quantity of pickle ingredient. </ITAG>(a) The recommended minimum quantity of pickle ingredient is designatedas the percentage of the declared volume of product in the container forall items except pickle relish. Minimum quantity of pickle relish is designatedas a relationship of the drained weight of the pickle ingredient to thedeclared volume of the container. The minimum quantities recommended inTables III and IV of this section are not factors of quality for the purposesof these grades. (b) The percent volume of pickle ingredient is determined for all styles,except relish, by one of the following methods in accordance with the proceduresprescribed by the Processed Products Branch, Fruit and Vegetable Division:(1) Direct displacement (overflow-can method); (2) Displacement in a graduated cylinder; (3) Measurement of pickle liquid; (4) Any other method that gives equivalent results and is approved by theProcessed Products Branch, Fruit and Vegetable Division. (c) Drained weight/volume. The percent weight/volume (w/v) of relish shownin Table IV of this section, is determined as follows: The drained weightof pickle relish of all types is determined by emptying the contents ofthe container upon a U.S. Standard No. 8 circular sieve of proper diametercontaining 8 meshes to the inch (0.0937 inch andplusmin;3 percent, squareopenings) so as to distribute the product evenly, inclining the sieve slightlyto facilitate drainage, and allowing to drain for 2 minutes. The drainedweight is the weight of the sieve and the pickles less the weight of thedry sieve. A sieve 8 inches in diameter is used for 1 quart and smallersize containers and a sieve 12 inches in diameter is used for containerslarger than 1 quart in size. <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L0,tp8,p7,8/9,g1,t1,i1,s20,xs50 </C>Table III._<T3>Recommended Pickle Ingredient, All Styles Except Relish </T3><H1>  </H1><H1/><T3>Minimum fill (volume) </T3> Type of Pack: <ITAG tagnum="3">Cured </ITAG><D>55 percent. </D><ITAG tagnum="3">Fresh-Pack </ITAG><D>57 percent. </D><ITAG tagnum="3">Refrigerated </ITAG><D>57 percent. </D></ITAG> <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L0,tp8,p7,8/9,g1,t1,i1,s20,xs50 </C>Table IV._<T3>Recommended Drained Weight To Container Volume, Relish </T3><H1>  </H1><H1/><T3>Minimum fill (weight/volume) </T3> Type of Pack: <ITAG tagnum="12">Cured: </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="3">Sweet </ITAG><D>92 percent. </D><ITAG tagnum="3">Other than sweet </ITAG><D>88 percent. </D><ITAG tagnum="12">Fresh-pack: </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="3">Sweet </ITAG><D>85 percent. </D><ITAG tagnum="3">Other than sweet </ITAG><D>80 percent. </D></ITAG> <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection;52.1688 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Sample unit size. </ITAG>For all styles of pickles and types of pack, the sample unit used in analyzingthe quality factors is the entire contents of the container unless otherwisespecified in 7 CFR Part 52.1-52.83. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection;52.1689 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Grades.</ITAG>(a) <T3>U.S. Grade A</T3> is the quality of pickles that meets the applicablerequirements of Tables, V, VI, VII, VIII, IX, X, and XI of andSection;52.1691and scores not less than 90 points.
