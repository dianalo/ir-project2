Most of the leaders of the seven-week movement that ended inbloodshed in June were college students.   Wu'er Kaixi, the charismatic leader who fled to the UnitedStates, is 21. The average age of the 21 students on China's mostwanted list of student leaders is 23.   Students say the older generation was so cowed by years ofoppression that it dared not support the students.   An intellectual in his late 60s said recently of the currentcrackdown on dissent, ``They're not paying too much attention to usoldsters. This time it's the young ones.''   The intellectual, who like the others spoke on condition ofanonymity, said the leadership probably believes the oldergeneration supports the government line, which calls the democracymovement a counter-revolutionary rebellion that sought to topple thegovernment.   ``Regardless of what they think, they know we wouldn't have theguts to do'' what the students did, he said.   Troops killed hundreds of civlians on June 3-4 as they put downthe popular movement. Since then, all Chinese are forced to undergoweekly political study sessions at their work units, and collegestudents this fall have had several weeks of intensive politicalstudy.   The students were the inspiration and the force behind themovement that was joined by hundreds of thousands of ordinarycitizens, most in their 20s or 30s.   They are a generation that has grown up with only dim memories ofthe horrors of the ultra-leftist 1966-76 Cultural Revolution and forwhom the rigidity and purges of the 1950s and early 1960s arehistory.   For the youth, the past 10 years of opening to the outside worldhave been the most vivid, and they have welcomed what foreignershave brought to China _ from the ideals of democracy, freedom andhuman rights, to Western cigarettes, fancy clothes and rock'n'roll.   A Beijing University student who actively participated in themovement spoke impatiently of his parents and their generation, whohe said were afraid of the changes he and his friends sought.   He said that his parents were ``afraid to even think about whatwe were saying,'' much less support or even take part in themovement because of their experiences with China's rapidly changingpolitical winds.   The old intellectual, who has repeatedly been persecuted duringChina's frequent political campaigns, tried to dissuade youngfriends and colleagues from even going to see what was happening inTiananmen Square.   Many older Chinese forbade their teen-age and college-agechildren to go out during the protests because they have learned itis best not to get involved in political affairs.   At Beijing University recently, a senior advised a foreignertalking to school security personnel not to ask too many questionsabout what happened this spring.   ``The older folks, they don't think like us, they don'tunderstand,'' he said. ``If you ask too many pointed questions ofthem, they may get you in trouble.''   The old intellectual, asked if he thought what the students didwas right, said, ``You ask me what is correct and what isn't, (but)I can't tell you.''   The Beijing University student, however, had no doubts at all.   While regretting the high price that was paid, he said, ``What wedid was right.''   Others students echo his words, even three months after thecrackdown and after weeks of intensive political education atschool. But they also say they get no support from their parents fortheir activities.   A senior at a technical school said that when he went home inlate May after taking part in the hunger strike, his parents forbadehim to return to Beijing and told him the students were foolish tothink they could change anything.</TEXT></DOC>
