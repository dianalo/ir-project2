We produce carbon dioxide with ourindustry. The rain forest cleans it up. That's a singular servicethat country is giving us,'' Sting said at a news conference. ``Weowe Brazil something.''   Depending on the estimates, the Amazon rain forest has beendepleted 5 percent to 12 percent, with an area the size of afootball field going every five minutes. Much of it is being burned.   Ecologists say the vast jungle, as part of the worldwide systemdubbed the ``lungs of the Earth,'' converts carbon dioxide intoneeded oxygen. Some ecologists warn that the loss of the Amazonrain forest contributes to the ``greenhouse effect,'' or globalwarming.   Resources from the Amazon also are used in production of asignificant amount of the world's prescription drugs.   Sting, seated with Indian tribal leaders from Brazil and SouthDakota, said he was glad attention was now focused on the Amazon.   ``What doesn't please me is the emphasis of that attention'' _the search for a culprit, Sting said. ``If I was a poor Brazilian,had no money, no land, I too would burn the forest. So too wouldeveryone in this room.''   Sting blamed the multinational corporations and the banks in theUnited States for bleeding Brazil with fixed, inflexible interestrates on the South American nation's debt.   ``The reason is America is in debt, also,'' said Sting.   ``Why? I'd have to say it's because we've wasted our money onnuclear arms, our so-called defense budget. It's the poor people ofthe world who are paying that.''   The Brazil-based Rainforest Foundation hopes to raise $4 millionto $5 million to protect 100,000 square miles that already belongto the Indians with a buffer of trees, observation towers andranger stations, to buy one or two airplanes, maintain the area anddevelop cash crops.   Norway has donated $200,000 and other governments have indicatedan interest. Members Only, a clothing manufacturer, announced atthe news conference that it is devoting its fall advertisingprogram to the campaign to preserve the rain forest.   The campaign began last month in France with an audience withPresident Francois Mitterrand. The group also has met with thepope. Next stops are Canada, Japan and Australia.   In Brazil, which has rejected outside interference in thematter, President Jose Sarney has listened to the group, Sting said.   ``We have a dialogue,'' Sting said. ``We hope to finesse thatdialogue into a successful mission.''</TEXT></DOC>
