Federal Judge Oliver Gasch ruled here last May that it is unconstitutional for Congress to limit the use of secrecy pledges for federal workers. Judge Gasch said such congressional action interfered with the constitutional powers of the president to protect information involving national security.    A bipartisan group of seven liberal and conservative members of Congress and the American Foreign Service Association, a federal workers' union, appealed to the Supreme Court.    The case involves a policy adopted by President Reagan in 1983 requiring federal employees to sign a secrecy pledge before gaining access to classified information. The policy was challenged by federal workers who argued that the pledge was too broad and covered unclassified material as well. In particular, they objected to part of the pledge barring release of &quot;classifiable&quot; material, which they said could mean material that hasn't yet been classified.    While the suit was pending, Congress in December 1987 barred the president from requiring a pledge covering &quot;classifiable&quot; material. Administration officials then defined &quot;classifiable&quot; to mean information that isn't clearly marked as classified or is in the process of being classified.    A new suit was filed by the members of Congress and the federal union, arguing that by continuing to require secrecy pledges, the administration was violating the 1987 congressional prohibition. Judge Gasch then ruled that the 1987 prohibition by Congress was unconstitutional.    The Justice Department argued that there was no need for the high court to hear arguments in the case, and that the justices should simply affirm Judge Gasch's ruling. But Patti Goldman, a lawyer with the consumer-oriented Public Citizen Litigation Group, which represents the union and the members of Congress, warned that Judge Gasch's ruling &quot;is so broad that the logic could bar Congress from acting in a wide range of national security areas.&quot; (American Foreign Service Association v. Garfinkel)   Justice Sandra O'Connor returned to the court for oral arguments yesterday, after undergoing breast cancer surgery Oct. 21.    Middle South Utilities   The high court let stand a federal appeals court decision reinstating a securities-fraud class action lawsuit against Middle South Utilities Inc.    The suit was filed in August 1985 by shareholders of Middle South from 1983 through 1985. It alleged that the utility holding company failed to properly disclose costs and other factors relating to its Grand Gulf I nuclear plant. Middle South's operating units have had a hard time persuading state utility regulators to let them pass Grand Gulf's costs on to consumers. The suit was filed when the company came to the verge of bankruptcy and the stock value declined from $12 a share to $9.13 in just two days in August 1985.    In January 1987, a federal judge in Louisiana dismissed the suit before trial, ruling that Middle South's factual disclosures during the disputed years were adequate. But in June 1988, an appeals court in New Orleans reinstated the suit and ordered the case to go to trial. (Middle South Utilities Inc. v. Isquith)   State Death Row Cases   The justices agreed to decide whether states must provide lawyers to represent death-row inmates who challenge the constitutionality of their convictions in state courts. The high court will hear the state of Virginia's appeal of a June 1988 ruling by a federal appeals court in Richmond, Va.    The case involves the stage of criminal proceedings after an inmate has been convicted and lost all appeals. In many states and in federal court, persons convicted of crimes then may file civil suits arguing that some aspect of their arrest or trial violated their rights. The appeals court in Richmond ruled that states must provide lawyers in such cases to help guarantee that inmates on death row have access to the courts. (Murray v. Giarratano)</TEXT></DOC>
