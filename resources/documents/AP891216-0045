Wind chills of 20 below were predicted in parts ofTennessee. Lower Michigan and North Carolina's mountains braced forwind chills as cold as 30 below and parts of Indiana and Iowaexpected winds that made it feel like 40 below.

New snowaccumulations of between 1 and 3 inches fell north and west of thenation's capital.   The pressure difference between an intensifying low along NewEngland's coast and the arctic high over the nation's midsectionspawned the frigid winds.
