During the winter whenthe air temperature is below the ground temperature, the heat pipe functionsto remove heat from the permafrost, thus maintaining its integrity duringthe months when thawing can occur. A problem with the heat pipe operationis the presence of small amounts of non-condensable hydrogen gas whichaccumulates primarily in the condenser section and results in condenserblockage, leading to reduced heat removal capability. According to thisinvention, it has been found that contaminant hydrogen gas can be successfullyremoved and gettered from such types of heat pipes by the use of a gettermaterial, preferably a Zr intermetallic alloy, which is effective evenin the presence of air or water. Furthermore, it has been found thatthe alloy non-reversibly getters the hydrogen gas such that the hydrogen,once removed, does not reenter the gaseous ammonia system to cause blockageduring the operating cycle of the heat pipe. More specifically, the inventionprovides a getter assembly and a heat pipe including such an assembly,such that the heat pipe is capable of operating year round in an arcticenvironment without any loss of efficiency in cooling of the permafrost.7 figs., 2 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
