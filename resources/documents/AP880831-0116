Two people were killed during thedemonstrations and more than 800 arrested.   At least 21 people were injured in the clashes.   Pinochet, 72, promised a move toward democracy after being namedTuesday as the only candidate in an Oct. 5 presidential referendum.The right-wing general has run Chile since taking power in a bloody1973 coup. Pinochet called on his followers ``to fight to achievevictory'' in the presidential plebiscite.   Thousands in the capital banged empty pots and pans in protestand demonstrators erected barricades with burning tires and blockedtraffic at many intersections Tuesday night in Santiago, a city of4.5 million residents.   Hospital officials said Erickson Palma, 15, was killed byunidentified gunmen who fired from a speeding car as he banged apot from the window of his home in southwestern Santiago.   Officials at the hospital where Palma was taken said theteen-ager was shot twice in the chest. The spokespeople said threeother demonstrators were shot and wounded in similar circumstancesand one of them, also a boy, died.   Police Capt. Alejandro Sierra said 19 other people were injuredand 846 were arrested in Santiago. Four public buses were set afireand destroyed by demonstrators, and one of the bus drivers wasseriously burned, he said.   Similar protests occurred Tuesday night in many other cities.Police did not report on casualties or arrests in those cities.   But this morning, a duty officer at the Santiago policeheadquarters said without elaborating, ``It's totally calm now.''   The protests began as Pinochet and the other military commandersmet to choose the nominee, and became more violent through thenight.   Power outages occurred in several suburbs of Santiago and thenorthern coastal city of La Serena. The cause of the blackouts wasnot known, but the power transmission towers are a favorite targetof leftist guerrillas.   Pinochet heralded his nomination as ``a decisive moment in theinstitutional process'' started by his 15-year-old government. Theopposition denounced it as the continuation of ``an agingdictatorship.''   ``If I govern, you govern,'' Pinochet told thousands ofsupporters from a balcony of the government palace. He called onthem ``to fight to achieve victory'' in the upcoming ballot.   Pinochet led the September 1973 coup that ousted the electedgovernment of Marxist President Salvador Allende, who died in thepalace takeover. Pinochet has been president of the militarygovernment since.   If the majority of the 7.2 million registered voters cast``yes'' ballots for Pinochet, he will start a new term March 11 tolast until 1997. If he is rejected, an open election will takeplace within a year, with Pinochet remaining in power until then.   ``The operetta is over. Gen. Pinochet has imposed his will andis preparing to continue to oppress his people until the end of thecentury,'' said Ricardo Lagos, a socialist and co-leader of a16-party opposition coalition.   ``Chileans must decide between an aging dictatorship and reneweddemocracy,'' Lagos said.   The centrist Christian Democratic party said in a writtenstatement, ``The nomination of Gen. Pinochet, with his own vote, isthe best denial of the supposed democratic intentions of theregime.''   The nomination was made by Pinochet himself, along with Navycommander Adm. Jose Toribio Merino; Air Force chief Gen. FernandoMatthei and National Police director Gen. Rodolfo Stange.   In his acceptance speech, Pinochet said his government isforging a new society in Chile with a new type of democracy,protected against ``totalitarianism.''   ``The full democracy that approaches constitutes a new challengefor everyone,'' he said. ``It also will demand of us allovercoming, adapting and rectifying to create a new style ofpolitical coexistence.''</TEXT></DOC>
