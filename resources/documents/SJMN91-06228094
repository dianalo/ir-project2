By thetone and content of Mr. Garrissere's attacks upon these practices . . . hemakes obvious his lack of knowledge of wilderness management, public service,forest service policies and basic knowledge of multiple land use policies.;    Mr. Garrissere . . . apparently is not aware of the licenses and permitsrequired to offer these services by the Forest Service and Department of Fishand Game. Packers must be insured and bonded to assure the safety of thepublic and regulate use/abuse of our natural resources. This policy ofregulating packing services is endorsed in all of our Western states in orderto promote the responsible enjoyment of every American's land.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Venture  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  MULTIPLE USE MANAGEMENT OFFERS BALANCED APPROACH  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Venture -- Celebrating the active lifeLetters to Venture  </MEMO><TEXT>      The most basic concept he fails to grasp is that of &quot;multiple usemanagement.&quot; The land in question belongs to every citizen, not justbackpackers. In order to provide a given level of use balanced withprotection, &quot;Designated Wilderness Areas&quot; are limited only to foot travel,horse or human. No wheeled conveyances or motors of any kind are allowed.Within these constraints any legal activity is allowed such as hunting,fishing, hiking and, yes, horseback riding.;    In the devastating forestfires of 1987 chainsaws could not even be used to control the burn by federallaw. I seriously doubt that Mr. Garrissere is more educated and experiencedthan the professional biologists and foresters that develop the policies hecriticizes.;    Those individuals who think that packers are making money handover fist should pull their heads out of the clouds. It costs a ton of moneyto feed and care for 15 horses. After advertising, paying hands, buyingsupplies and gas, a packer barely makes minimum wage to get up at 3 a.m. andwork a 15-backbreaking-hour day.;    Why they continue to do it is simple;they love their way of life.; -- Stephen J.
