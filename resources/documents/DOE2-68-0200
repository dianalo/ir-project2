Most of today's larger (over 1000 kilowatt) applicationsof cogeneration are operated around the clock with electricity salesto electric utilities even when the host plant is at a reduced nightor weekend status. Cogeneration Energy Services can represent one ofthe outstanding utility marketing opportunities for the 1980s. Thereis no need to wait for research and development - the equipment is commerciallyavailable now. The marketing opportunity lends itself to a variety ofcustomized approaches in numerous utility service areas with promisethat the cogeneration applications will broaden as electric rates riseand nuclear rate shock takes effect in more areas of the country. Improvingequipment might have an impact in making more applications feasible,but there is no need to wait.</TEXT></DOC>
