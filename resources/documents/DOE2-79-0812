The degree of automation varies from companyto company. The small, independent home heating fuel plant a with throughputof only a few thousand gallons a day may not be able to justify a full-blownautomation system. Conversely, a major terminal with several milliongallons a day cannot operate on a simple security oriented system. Thechallenge is to select a Terminal Automation System that best suits yourneeds, today and tomorrow. The benefits of automation, ranging from plantaccess security to improved product accountability, are limitless. Theterm Automated Truck Loading Systems encompasses several areas. One caneasily imagine the array of products and ideas that fall within thisterm. The objective of this paper is to detail the options availablealong with their benefits to the user. This is best accomplished by viewingthe terminal operation in two parts, the load rack or riser equipment,and then the Terminal Automation System (T.A.S.). Once the two areasof operation are understood, the integration of the systems can be understood.</TEXT></DOC>
