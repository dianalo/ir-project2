Col.William Higgins.   Rafsanjani has been quoted by the Soviet news agency Tass asdenying in a meeting with visiting Soviet Foreign Minister EduardShevardnadze that Iran had any ``relation to the tragedy.''   The Mujahedeen Khalq, or People's Holy Warriors, said in astatement that Rafsanjani exerts direct control of the radicalShiite Moslem groups believed to be holding Western hostages inLebanon.   The group said Rafsanjani sent his brother, Mahmoud, ``secretlyto Syria a few days ago in order to closely supervise the terroristacts of the regime's proxies in Lebanon, including the execution ofthe American hostage, Col. Higgins.''   The opposition's statement said Mahmoud Rafsanjani heads theIranian foreign ministry's ``Lebanon Committee'' set up tocoordinate the kidnappers' activities.   The statement was sent by telex to The Associated Press fromBaghdad, Iraq, where the group has its headquarters.   A Shiite Moslem group calling itself the Organization of theOppressed on Earth claimed it hanged the U.S. Marine on Monday inretaliation for Israel's abduction Friday of a Shiite Moslem clericin south Lebanon.   The group released a videotape that purported to show Higginshanging from a makeshift gallows. There was no indication when itwas filmed. Prior reports indicated that Higgins, who led a75-member U.N. truce monitoring force in Lebanon, may have beenkilled by his captors last year.   Moslem fundamentalist groups loyal to Iran are believed to beholding most of the 16 western hostages in Lebanon.   They are thought to be linked to Hezbollah, or Party of God, anIranian-backed Shiite Moslem group seeking to dominate the1.2-million strong Shiite community in Lebanon, the country'slargest sect.   The Mujahedeen statement alleged that several Hezbollahofficials sent from Tehran to Lebanon were told to ``extend theirstay in Beirut for another two weeks on the orders ofPresident-elect Rafsanjani in order to carry out the execution ofCol. Higgins.''   Hezbollah denies it has anything to do with hostage-taking,while Iran has sought to distance itself from the reported hangingand threats to execute other western hostages held in Lebanon.   Rafsanjani, who was voted president by a landslide majority inFriday's election, is believed anxious to erase Iran's image as asponsor of international terrorism.   Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati said Monday before Higgins'death was announced the threat against him ``has nothing to do withus ... However, we condemn any kind of kidnapping or death threat.''   But on Sunday, Interior Minister Ali Akbar Mohtashemi warnedthat Islamic groups around the world would retaliate for theaduction of the cleric, Sheik Abdul-Karim Obeid.   The Mujahedeen statement said Iran used its embassy in Damascus,Syria, as a headquarters for Hezbollah activities in Lebanon. Syriais a close ally of Iran.   The statement said Iranian Revolutionary Guards based in Lebanonwere responsible for ``military training of terrorists, operationalplanning, interrogations and other intelligence operations by theregime's proxy terrorist groups in Lebanon.''   About 4,000 Revolutionary Guards are currently believed based inthe Syrian-controlled Bekaa valley in eastern Lebanon.   Khomeini's 1979 fundamentalist revolution in Iran helped spawnseveral Shiite terrorist groups in Lebanon. Revolutionary Guards,sent into Lebanon during the 1982 Israeli invasion, helped organizeHezbollah.</TEXT></DOC>
