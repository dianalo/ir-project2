ANDREWS</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Please, doesn't anybody out there love abureaucrat?   Last June, entrepreneur Matthew Lesko launched ``My FavoriteBureaucrat'' contest and invited people around the country tosubmit ``a brief, verifiable story of 250 words or less about how agovernment bureaucrat helped you.''   Lesko offered a $5,000 cash prize for the winning entry andfigured he'd be swamped with nominations. After all, he says, thereare plenty of federal, state and local bureaucrats to choose from _about 15 million altogether.   Today, Lesko is flabbergasted. In the past four months, he hasreceived exactly one entry.   Even worse, it was submitted by a woman employee of the New YorkState Department of Taxation and Finance who nominated her boss.   ``My God, I just can't believe the lack of response,'' saidLesko, the author of books and newsletters on where to get freeadvice from government experts on everything from playing the stockmarket to curing a backache to buying a new refrigerator.   Lesko says he plugged the contest in thousands of news releasesmailed from his suburban Chevy Chase, Md., office, on Larry King'sradio show, Pat Sajak's television show and the C-SPAN cable TVnetwork, and in speeches around the country promoting the dozenbooks he has written.   Besides the $5,000 prize for the contest winner, Lesko promised$500 to each of two runners-up, a plaque for the winning ``favoritebureaucrat'' and a free list of the government's two dozen bestsources of information for every contest participant.   ``I can't believe how this idea fell so flat,'' Leskocomplained. He suspects the problem runs deeper than any lack ofpublicity.   ``The government is the biggest source of information and helpon anything you could want,'' he said. ``All the millionaires, likeLee Iacocca and Donald Trump, use it. I even got free legal advicefrom the Federal Trade Commission on how to run this contest.   ``But the average guy in the street probably just hates thegovernment, is intimidated by it and doesn't think there's anythingthere but waste, fraud and abuse,'' Lesko said.   ``The only contact most people have with the government isdealing with the Internal Revenue Service and the division of motorvehicles, which are probably the two worst experiences anybody canhave.''   The public's antagonism toward the government apparently is sovirulent, Lesko said, that a contest to nominate the biggestbureaucratic bunglers probably would produce a flood of entries.   ``I wouldn't do that to the Post Office,'' he said.   Someone who understands the public's reluctance to identifyhelpful, competent bureaucrats is James H. Boren, a former StateDepartment official and Washington humorist who is president of theInternational Association of Professional Bureaucrats.   ``People are rather fearful of making such information public,''Boren said. ``If they say a bureaucrat has helped them, it's likesaying they've seen a UFO in the sky. People might think they'renot totally balanced.''</TEXT><NOTE>EDITORS' NOTE </NOTE><TEXT>   The contest deadline is Dec. 31.
