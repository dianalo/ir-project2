HIGGINS</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   West German opposition leader Hans-JochenVogel today praised President Reagan's arms-control advances andsaid the atmosphere had greatly improved since their last meetingfive years ago.   Vogel, chairman of the Social Democratic Party, told reportersafter a 20-minute meeting with Reagan at the White House that heand the president had discussed arms control, the economy and humanrights.   ``We had a very friendly and constructive conversation with thepresident,'' he said. ``I ... said, remembering five years back, weare very impressed especially by the INF (Intermediate NuclearForces) treaty, by the cooperation which developed with the SovietUnion.''   Vogel said he told Reagan he hoped he and Soviet leader MikhailGorbachev also would be able to agree soon on reducing long-rangenuclear forces.   He said the president ``seemed to be satisfied about the work,what has been done in the last two or three days. They worked veryhard, they worked very (thoroughly) through the details.''   He was referring to a visit by Soviet Foreign Minister EduardShevardnadze, who has been meeting with Secretary of State GeorgeShultz and Reagan in Washington this week.   ``Remembering my visit five years ago, it is a remarkablechange. It was a relaxed conversation. There are still some pointsof different views and different opinions, but there are pointswhich we join and which we agree (on).''   ``In '83 we were in the middle of the argument about thedeployment of Pershing II and there have been some other fields ofdifferent opinions. Many of them are gone. The president making theINF treaty and preparing START is a president more close to us thansome remarks and some positions of '81 or '82 or '83,'' Vogel said.   The Social Democrats were part of the widespread opposition toNAT0's deployment of the U.S. medium-range Pershing II and cruisemissiles in Europe to counter Soviet SS-20 missiles aimed atWestern Europe. The INF treaty would eliminate both the U.S. andSoviet land-based medium-range missiles.   Vogel said Reagan listened but didn't comment when he told himthat West German Social Democrats, like the coalition government,oppose modernization of short-range nuclear weapons in Europe. Hesaid he made clear that the Social Democrats go further than thegovernment in urging negotiations to eliminate the weapons.   ``I think he was not surprised,'' Vogel said.   West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, of the ruling ChristianDemocrats, advocates a reduction in the number of the missiles butnot their elimination.   The United States, Britain and France favor the modernization ofthe short-range weapons as part of NATO's nuclear deterrent againsta Soviet bloc attack on Western Europe.</TEXT></DOC>
