Is Expected to UnveilNew 'Smokeless' Cigarette to Market Soon---By John HelyarStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 09/14/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> RJRFOOD andamp; BEVERAGE, HOUSEHOLD GOODS, SUPERMARKETS, TOBACCO (FAB) </IN><TEXT>   RJR Nabisco Inc. is expected today to unveil a new &quot;smokeless&quot; cigarette, which it will soon bring to market.    Company officials wouldn't confirm or deny that development, which would be a major technological effort to stem the anti-smoking tide. But executives of the R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. unit are holding a news conference this morning in New York, and analysts are almost certain that's the subject.    RJR's stock rose $2.875, to $67.75, in New York Stock Exchange trading Friday, following a broadcast report that such an announcement was imminent. Other tobacco stocks rose as well, on speculation that competitors may soon come out with such a product as well.    The mechanics of this new cigarette aren't clear, but it is expected that it would enable the smoker to exhale smoke that is nearly undetectable. In recent years, some prominent medical studies have held that exhaled smoke is harmful to nearby non-smokers. That has both helped fuel ordinances banning public smoking and made smoking unacceptable in some social settings.    The product is expected to be presented as a healthier alternative for the smoker as well. A reconstituted cigarette could, for instance, produce less tar, those who follow the industry say.    But even a cigarette that only mainly reduced the social opposition could be a big winner, according to Kurt Feuerman, an analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. That would be a boost for RJR, which like other cigarette makers has seen steadily declining domestic volume. &quot;Growth brands in American cigarettes are rare and valuable,&quot; said Mr. Feuerman.    Such a high-profile new product would also present an element of risk, however. Many smokers feel the sight of their exhaled smoke is one of the pleasures of the experience. Smokers would also, of course, have to like the cigarette's taste. There is also a danger for RJR that the new product would cannibalize sales of its existing brands, which likely carry higher profit margins.    Moreover, many feel the new cigarette wouldn't itself turn the anti-smoking tide but at best only slow it. Already, the Centers for Disease Control last week reported that the adult smoking rate has dipped to a new low of 26.5%, and to many Americans the habit is not only unhealthy but unfashionable. &quot;The basic problem isn't the smoke but the social psychology,&quot; said David A. Goldman, an analyst with L.F. Rothschild, Unterberg, Towbin Inc.    Nor is the new cigarette likely to mollify anti-smoking crusaders. &quot;We're very afraid this creates many more serious problems both for the smoker and the non-smoker,&quot; said John Banzhaf, executive director of Action on Smoking and Health, an anti-smoking legal-action group based in Washington.    Mr. Banzhaf said he understands RJR has found a way to create a hotter flame at the tip of the cigarette, a feature that would result in the smoker exhaling much smaller, hard-to-see particles. But he maintains that could keep non-smokers from knowing they are being exposed. He said smaller particles may also drift farther from the smoker, affecting a wider area, and that they may more readily get into the smoker's bloodstream.    RJR had been rumored to be trying to develop a smokeless cigarette for some time. About three years ago, the company built a heavily guarded, highly secret research facility near its Winston-Salem, N.C., headquarters. That compound came to be known locally as &quot;The Black Hole&quot; and is believed to be where the product was developed.    Speculation recently had increased in that city about the imminent introduction of a new kind of cigarette. Analysts, who were taken by surprise Friday, speculate that such talk may have forced the company's announcement in advance of the marketing of the product to consumers. </TEXT></DOC>
