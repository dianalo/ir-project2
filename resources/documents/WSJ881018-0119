Defense attorneys, who applauded the decision, said about $16 million in assets would be secured pending the outcome of the case.    As soon as Princeton/Newport posts a bond in that amount, Judge Robert L. Carter said, he would lift a court order that has allowed the government to control the assets of the unindicted firm since five of the firm's general partners were indicted last August.    &quot;The government is effectively out of our business now,&quot; said Theodore Wells, a Roseland, N.J., attorney representing one of the indicted partners. The $16 million bond, which he said would be posted by the end of this week, can be secured without touching the assets of unindicted third parties.    &quot;The firm's limited partners and the business's many creditors will not in any way be jeopardized by the bond. We can get on with the business again,&quot; Mr. Wells said.    Yesterday's ruling marks the end of the firm's sometimes heated debate with federal prosecutors over just how far the government can reach into the coffers of an unindicted partnership to secure funds it may want to seize if indicted partners are convicted on criminal racketeering charges. Convictions under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations law, or RICO, allow the government to seize any proceeds from criminal activities and to preserve property prior to conviction so that it remains available later.    The issue arises out of the Aug. 4 indictment of five of the firm's partners and a former Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. trader, Bruce L. Newberg, on charges that they had engaged in a racketeering conspiracy to create illegal tax losses through phony stock deals.    Because the case represents the first time the government has brought charges under the criminal RICO law against securities officials, all rulings have been scrutinized, especially by white-collar defense attorneys. Indeed, attorneys representing defendants in the Securities and Exchange Commission's civil suit against Drexel, its junk-bond chief Michael Milken and others have attended many of the court hearings in the Princeton/Newport case.    U.S. Attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani has issued &quot;target letters&quot; to at least five individuals in the Drexel investigation, including Mr. Milken, formally indicating that federal prosecutors will seek criminal charges against them. And there is some speculation that the government might use the criminal RICO statute in any such indictment.    At an earlier hearing, Judge Carter said that according to his interpretation of RICO, the government does have the right to tie up the assets of innocent third parties, if needed, for the purpose of securing funds that might be seized if the defendants are convicted. That will not be necessary in the case of Princeton/Newport, defense attorneys said, largely because of yesterday's ruling. Such innocent third parties in this case included 90 limited partners and 167 financial institutions with which the firm has credit.    In effect, Judge Carter said that the government, upon conviction, can only seize the defendants' interests in the &quot;racketeering enterprise&quot; during the period when the alleged crimes occurred. Further, the government cannot touch any appreciation in the value of those interests after that period.    As a result, the judge said the government wasn't entitled to about $8 million of the nearly $24 million that it was seeking.    Though hailing yesterday's ruling as a victory, the defense attorneys continue to accuse the government of &quot;overreaching&quot; in their use of RICO to prosecute for what Paul Grand, a New York attorney representing one of the indicted partners, has referred to as a &quot;garden-variety tax offense.&quot; The illicit proceeds from the alleged tax fraud amounted to about $446,000, the government said in a letter to defense attorneys last week. &quot;To seek a $16 million bond as security against $446,000 is outrageous,&quot; said Mr. Grand.    The government's position, however, is that it has the right to the defendants' salaries during the period of the crimes and their total stake in the firm. </TEXT></DOC>
