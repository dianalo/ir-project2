And thegovernment may eventually offer computer makers a way out ofthe doldrums.   But its purchases lag behind the private sector because ofthe government's arcane procurement rules. &quot;We can't doanything fast,&quot; says Steven Broadbent, the Treasury's deputyassistant secretary for information services.</LP><TEXT>   The Internal Revenue Service, for instance -- part of theTreasury Department -- plans to award a contract valued at asmuch as $400 million next month for tens of thousands ofmicrocomputers. This is the way the federal government triesto push prices down. It centralizes its computer buys --figuring higher volume means lower unit prices -- and thenmakes the procurements somewhat indefinite. That way a wholerange of users in the agencies can make use of the contractto get a low-cost computer. The IRS microcomputer purchase,for instance, is good for as long as four years, so peoplewho don't have an immediate need for the machine can decidelater on they need computers and purchase them under themicro contract.   Robert Dornan, vice president of Federal Sources Inc., aVienna, Va., market research firm that tracks federalcomputer spending, says the Pentagon has been able to drivedown prices with these so-called indefinite-deliverycontracts. The Air Force, for instance, will put out a hugeprocurement, which the other services then will tap when theyneed micros. &quot;They get commodity buys with fantastic pricecompetition and huge, huge discounts,&quot; he says.   Federal Sources also predicts that federal spending willhelp turn around the computer industry slump. The companyprojects that federal government purchases of computerhardware will jump 30% to $3.75 billion in the year endingSept. 30, 1992, from $2.9 billion in the current fiscal year.   Here are a few federal computer procurements that areexpected to be awarded over the next 18 months.   -- The Navy is expected to award a contract in October tobuy 1,700 superminicomputers, which would replacePerkin-Elmer Corp. minicomputers. Other defense servicescould buy superminis under this contract.   -- The Navy is also planning to buy 4,000 powerfulworkstations, with speeds of 50 million to 100 millioninstructions a second, for $400 million. These would be usedon ships to aid in tactical decision making. They wouldreplace current generation of Sun Microsystems Inc.microcomputers.   -- NASA also is expected to buy $100 million ofworkstations for its Goddard Space Flight Center inGreenbelt, Md.   &quot;We see a substantial growth in minis, workstations andnetworks,&quot; says Mr. Dornan. &quot;The government is moving a lotof work off mainframes and into distributed processing.&quot;   That trend is evident at the Internal Revenue Service,says Mr. Broadbent. &quot;The IRS is clearly headed in thedirection of distributed processing,&quot; he says.&quot;We're movingaway from huge centralized databases and moving them {thedatabases} out into the office, and maintaining a centralfile of where all the records are.&quot;   (See related story: &quot;Improvement in Mainframe MarketExpected to Be Slow&quot; -- WSJ May 16, 1991)</TEXT></DOC>
