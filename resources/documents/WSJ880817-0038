The General Motors Corp. unit said Mercury Marine will manufacture about 2,000 a year of the all-aluminum, 32-valve, 5.7-liter engines for the Corvette ZR1, a special-version model that will debut by early next spring.    A Chevrolet spokesman acknowledged the agreement was unusual, but added that under the circumstances, &quot;Mercury is the best business alternative.&quot;    GM said Mercury is expert at getting &quot;very high horsepower and long life from small-displacement, lightweight engines&quot; -- an important factor in boat racing. Mercury, Brunswick's largest division with 1987 sales in excess of $1 billion, is a dominant force in that field, where its MerCruiser stern drives and inboard engines have set numerous speed records.    GM said Mercury has an exclusive license to adapt the Corvette engine for marine use, effective about one year from the car's introduction. That agreement is more in keeping with the companies' traditional business relationship, under which Mercury has purchased GM-made marine engines and engine blocks.    Brunswick said inboard boat engines aren't all that different from car engines, since both have four cycles and share the same functions. But the Corvette engine will have a better power-to-weight ratio than normal boat engines. That means once it's adapted for boats, it will have more power and weigh less than comparable engines, Brunswick said.    The new Corvette engine was developed and designed by GM's Group Lotus division, of Hethel, England, in conjunction with Chevrolet. The engine will be capable of delivering as much as 390 horsepower, which could mean top speeds nearing 200 miles an hour for the ZR1. A lofty top speed wasn't the objective in designing the new engine, however, said the Chevrolet spokesman, adding that the car's exact performance specifications haven't been determined yet.    GM sold about 25,000 Corvettes in 1987. The 1989 models, other than the ZR1, will go on sale at the end of September with a base price of $31,545. Industry watchers estimate the ZR1 will cost more than $50,000, but the Chevrolet spokesman wouldn't discuss its price. </TEXT></DOC>
