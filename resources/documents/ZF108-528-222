 Tools that offer some degree of performancemeasurement and management include the system activity reporter inUNIX itself, AT and T's recently introduced Performance ManagementTools with its Performance Trending Facility, and the forthcomingInformix Software OnLine DBMS Monitor.andP;  A UNIX subgroup of theComputer Measurement Group intends to address performance issuesin the UNIX world.andM;</SUMMARY><DESCRIPT>Topic:     UNIXData Base Management SystemsPerformance MeasurementMethodsProductsSystem Development.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Measuring Unix Database PerformanceandM;When an MIS manager sees the price/performance numbers, a Unix-based machinemay look considerably better than a traditional mainframe.andP;  Many programmersprefer the Unix software development environment over that of an IBMmainframe, and Unix is the primary arena for technically advanced databasemanagement systems.andP;  Further, the idea of independence from a particularbrand of hardware and Unix's promise of wide portability can be veryattractive.andM;Benchmark results can provide an idea of software performance.andP;  But by now itis clear that most vendors tune their own software and applications verycarefully when they are about to run a competitive benchmark, and do not domuch for opposing systems.andM;For example, Oracle and Informix have both claimed to have the fastestUnix-based DBMS, based on the results of their own benchmarks.andM;TOOLS ARE LACKINGandM;Although it may not be safe to trust those benchmark numbers, at least theyare numbers.andP;  It is difficult to get useful performance data out of eitherthe database or the operating system of a Unix-based DBMS, due to a lack ofperformance management tools.andP;  It is like trying to fly a jumbo jet withoutan instrument panel.andM;According to industry analyst Richard Finkelstein, president of Chicago-basedPerformance Computing, &quot;Unix performance management tools are pretty scantcompared to what you find on the mainframes.andP;  Online transaction processingon Unix is a rather new concept, so the tools are substandard.&quot;andM;ATandamp;T's Tuxedo, said Finkelstein, is the first transaction processing monitoron Unix systems.andP;  &quot;Once that's under control, you can find out a lot,&quot; hesaid.andP;  (There is also at least one implementation of IBM's CICS under Unix.)andM;&quot;Networks provide an additional problem,&quot; said Finkelstein.andP;  &quot;You need anetwork monitor as well, and your database administrator may not be the rightperson for that project.&quot;andM;Performance measurement, Finkelstein concluded, &quot;is guesswork right now, butit will change with time.&quot;andM;Several areas can be examined when tuning a database application, accordingto Bill Osberg, director of database development for Sacramento, Calif.-basedUnify Corporation.andP;  &quot;Start from the highest level: What's my transactionthroughput?andP;  Measure how often you're logging commits,&quot; Osberg suggested.andM;&quot;At a lower level, check the rates of various operations: inserts, updates,deletes, searches and what tables are involved.andP;  You need to know which tableto see whether the table needs tuning of some kind.andM;&quot;Further into the lower levels, you might want to look at the types of locksbeing held,&quot; Osberg continued.andP;  &quot;Sometimes problems are related to the designof the transaction.andP;  You might not be using the system effectively.andP;  You'llhave a lot of idle time if people are holding locks for too long.andM;&quot;Next, you might want to look internally at DBMS 'latches', which controlaccess to shared data structures.andP;  These are totally controlled by thedatabase internally.andP;  Unify 2000, the firm's Unix DBMS, can be tuned to retryat various intervals,&quot; Osberg stated.andM;&quot;At the lowest level: physical and logical I/O operations,&quot; he continued.andO;&quot;Everything ultimately gets translated into this.andP;  How many pages are gettingwritten out to disk per second for each drive.andP;  How many cache hits do youget?&quot;andM;The information available about a Unify database today covers the locks andthe logical and physical I/Os, and that comes basically from the operatingsystem.andP;  You can indirectly get at transaction rates empirically.andP;  Most orall of this other information will be available from a performance monitor tobe included in the next release of the Unify database package, according toOsberg.andM;ONLINE MONITOR IN DEVELOPMENTandM;Gilbert Wai, director of product marketing for Informix Software, Menlo Park,Calif., commented on the Informix OnLine DBMS Monitor now in development.andP;  &quot;Amenu-driven user interface allows the database administrator to tell what'sgoing on in the database with respect to performance.andP;  You can spotbottlenecks or make appropriate changes when your application changes,&quot; Waisaid.andM;&quot;You can see how you're doing with cache hit ratios,&quot; he continued.andP;  (Thecache stores system tables, locks and logs before they are flushed to disk.andO;If they can be retrieved from cache rather than through a disk I/O,performance improves.andP;  If the cache hit ratio is low, more memory may need tobe allocated for the cache.)andM;&quot;You can extract other information: the count of disk reads, how many readsare out of the buffer, how many disk writes, how many are buffered, how muchis cached how many deadlocks are detected,&quot; Wai said.andP;  &quot;Primarily, this givesyou a sense of what's going on in the application.&quot;andM;He continued, &quot;There are some obvious issues: Do you have locking problems?andO;Have you got the right locking granularity?&quot;andP;  (That is, are you lockingrecords, pages or whole tables?)andP;  If you can lock at row-level instead oftable-level, other applications don't have to wait to use that table.andM;&quot;The 'Explain' option is useful for distributed queries.andP;  We describe all thethings that are used for the query processing: full-file read vs.andP;  indexedread, for example.andP;  It explains to the programmer what course the optimizertook,&quot; Wai said.andM;Without this kind of information, it is extremely difficult to tell what aparticular application is doing, and whether or not it could be doing itbetter.andP;  The standard Unix system is not very well equipped to determine whata particular application is doing.andM;Anthony Krause, manager of network operations at ATandamp;T, has spent a lot oftime measuring and tuning applications on Unix systems.andP;  &quot;unix itself is a'younger' operating system than the MVSes and VMs of the world,&quot; he said.andO;&quot;There is more vendor support for other systems in the area [of performancemanagement].andP;  As Unix gets out of being for minicomputers only, this issue ismaturing with it.andP;  Businesses want to make smarter use of resources, and theywant the same kind of capabilities as on IBM, and we are addressing that inUnix.&quot;andM;Krause continued, &quot;SAR, system activity reporter, is standard, but it showsresource usage across the whole system.andP;  I need to get down more specificallyinto the application level.andP;  Some information can be had from Unixaccounting, which will let us look at various transactions.andP;  But sometransactions won't show up per se--the entry for a menu-driven system willonly show that the menu is up.&quot;andM;To get detailed information on application performance, Krause said to &quot;dosome benchmarking of the application (not the system); dedicate the machineto the application and know you're running eight different transactions.&quot;andM;NEW TOOLS EMERGINGandM;New tools have appeared over the last couple of years.andP;  ATandamp;T has recentlymarketed Performance Management Tools (PMT).andP;  Two of these are used heavilyin the ATandamp;T IMS organization.andP;  The Performance Trending Facility (PTF)collects data and can trend it across different days; it also shows responsetimes.andP;  The Unix Facility for the Observation of Systems (UFOS) is moreuseful to system administrators who want to monitor the box and know when athreshold is approaching.andP;  It shows processor utilization, file systemstatistics, and so on.andM;While these tools are marketed by ATandamp;T, they are not standard parts of theUnix system.andP;  Several groups are interested in bringing some enhancedperformance measurement capacity to standard Unix.andM;The Computer Measurement Group, based in Chicago, is a professionalorganization addressing capacity and performance issues across allenvironments.andP;  The group has traditionally focused on IBM mainframes andcompatible computers.andM;A Unix subgroup was officially chartered at the national conference inDecember, 1989.andP;  Members are involved with most flavors of Unix, and aim tounderstand the application of general capacity management issues andtechniques to Unix environments.andM;ATandamp;T's Krause is also involved with the Performance Management Group, aspecial interest group in Unix International, Parsippany, N.J., theATandamp;T-sponsored Unix standards group.andP;  &quot;The idea there is to recommend toolsthat can be used to gather and disseminate performance data,&quot; Krause said.andM;A BETTER MOUSETRAPandM;Some members of the Open Software Foundation, Cambridge, Mass., the othermajor Unix standards group, are also pursuing a better mousetrap forperformance data.andP;  Hewlett-Packard, for one, has already submitted a schemeto modify the kernel for better collection of this information, and will tryto get this to Unix International as well.andM;Hewlett-Packard recently founded the Performance Technology Center inRoseville, Calif.andP;  The lab's staff includes Dave Glover, who also chairs thePerformance Management Special Interest Group within Unix International.andM;If database and OS vendors have their way, that jumbo jet will have a fullinstrument panel by the time MIS is ready to jump aboard.andM;Winston, an editor-at-large for UnixWorld magazine, does programming andsystem management for the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory in MenloPark, Calif.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
