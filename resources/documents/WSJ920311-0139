When we became aware the Learning Channelmight be for sale, I believed the channel would provide uswith a natural extension of our position as a leadingprovider of quality, nonfiction programming. Prior toconducting our due diligence, our initial estimate of theprice we might have been prepared to pay for such a businesswas based on standard cable-industry evaluation of suchcompanies. We considered the number of full-time, fee-payingsubscribers the channel allegedly had as well as ourassessment of the programming. Both factors are critical indetermining the financial viability of any channel.   Throughout the summer and fall of 1990, Discoverymanagement devised a formula for placing a value on theLearning Channel. In October, I presented our board with arecommended price based on a thorough evaluation of therelevant market factors. Ironically, in contrast to theinsinuations in your article, the Tele-Communications Inc.representative on our board indicated TCI might be preparedto support a higher bid (in fact, a bid that would haveexceeded the Lifetime bid), but management and the othershareholders (Cox Communications, Newhouse Broadcasting andI) felt the lower number was appropriate.</LP><TEXT>   The Bob Magness, John C. Malone and TCI that I have cometo know are not as portrayed in your article. In 1986, whenno one else would risk investing in the Discovery Channel,these gentlemen and their company bet on the intelligence ofthe American viewer. TCI kept Discovery going with amultimillion-dollar investment that was matched by Cox andNewhouse. Because Messrs. Malone and Magness and TCI tookthis gamble on behalf of their subscribers, the DiscoveryChannel serves 56 million cable households today.   John S.
