Col. William R. Higgins hasbeen killed by his pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem captors.   The Voice of Lebanon said Higgins was ``killed and buried by hiscaptors'' early this month in Siddiqine, a village in south Lebanon.   The Beirut-based Voice of Lebanon has a record of frequentinaccuracies concerning the foreign hostages in Lebanon. Its reporton Higgins could not be independently verified.   Timur Goksel, the spokesman for the U.N. Interim Force in southLebanon with which Higgins was serving when he was abducted, saidof the report: ``We can neither confirm nor deny the report oranything related to it.''   He spoke by telephone from the U.N. group's headquarters inNaqoura on the Lebanese-Israeli border.   ``We have no such information, and therefore we cannot commenton the radio report,'' Goksel added. ``We have checked with oursources, and everybody was surprised when they heard about thereport.''   At U.N. headquarters in New York, spokeswoman Nadia Younes latertold reporters that UNIFIL had checked with its sources and foundno confirmation of the radio report.   The radio said Higgins was killed hours before pro-Syrianmilitiamen of Justice Minister Nabih Berri's Amal militia capturedSiddiqine from Hezbollah supporters, apparently to keep Amal fromclaiming credit for his liberation.   Amal and Hezbollah spokesmen in Beirut made no comment on thereport. The two groups have been at odds since Higgins, 43, ofDanville, Ky., was kidnapped near the southern port of Tyre on Feb.17.   Siddiqine, 10 miles southeast of Tyre, was a Hezbollahstronghold before Amal crushed its Shiite Moslem fundamentalistrivals in a four-day crackdown early this month.   Amal supports the presence of the U.N. peace-keeping force inpredominantly Shiite south Lebanon. Hezbollah, or the Party of God,opposes it.   Amal has charged that Hezbollah masterminded Higgins' abductionto undermine Amal's control of south Lebanon.   Hezbollah is a pro-Iranian extremist group that is believed tobe an umbrella for factions holding most of the 22 foreign hostagesin Lebanon. Hezbollah has not claimed to hold any foreign hostages.   Higgins' abduction was claimed by a group calling itself theOrganization of the Oppressed on Earth, which charged that he was aCIA spy. Both the U.S. and U.N. have denied the charge.   Amal spokesmen had said their fighters found no trace of Higginsin any of the Hezbollah strongholds they have captured, includingSiddiqine.   The foreigners missing and presumed kidnapped in Lebanon arenine Americans, four Frenchmen, three Britons, one Irishman, oneItalian, one West German, one Indian, and two unidentified men.   The longest held is Terry A. Anderson, 40, chief Middle Eastcorrespondent for The Associated Press, who was kidnapped March 16,1985.</TEXT></DOC>
