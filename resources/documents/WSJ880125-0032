Albert Gore, and left little of the spotlight for former Sen. Gary Hart.    The debate's open format allowed the young Tennessean to inject himself repeatedly into the proceedings with remarks critical of Missouri Rep. Richard Gephardt, Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis and Illinois Sen. Paul Simon, as well as Mr. Gore's chief rival in the South, the Rev. Jesse Jackson. Sen. Gore labeled Rep. Gephardt's trade policies &quot;nonsense&quot; and derided Gov. Dukakis's claim to an economic &quot;miracle&quot; in reviving his state.    In a sharp exchange, Sen. Gore said a 5% national sales tax proposed by former Arizona Gov. Bruce Babbitt was regressive and a &quot;Republican idea.&quot; At a protest from Mr. Babbitt, who had been the aggressor in recent debates, Sen. Gore pointed to the television cameras and said, &quot;You can say these red lights are ducks but that doesn't make them ducks.&quot;    The Gore tactics limited Mr. Hart's opportunity to seize the stage. Though more forceful than in last week's Iowa debate, the Colorado Democrat went on the defensive early when NBC newsman and debate moderator John Chancellor characterized his re-entry into the race with the old song line, &quot;Will you love me in December as you do in May?&quot; Mr. Chancellor insisted the remark was only a &quot;joke,&quot; but Mr. Hart -- troubled by stories about his love life -- said angrily that it was in &quot;questionable taste.&quot;    The debate at the University of New Hampshire took place as new surveys in Iowa showed a virtual dead heat among Rep. Gephardt, Gov. Dukakis, and Sen. Simon. In a Des Moines Register poll published yesterday, the three were favored, respectively, by 19%, 18% and 17% of Iowa Democrats, while Mr. Babbitt jumped to 10% from 2% in a similar December poll. The four men used the debate more to hone their messages than to break any new ground.    The Register said support for Mr. Hart dropped to 13% from 29%.    Except for Mr. Jackson, the Democrats showed caution about Jewish support by avoiding criticism of Israel for its treatment of Palestinians in occupied territories. They directed their remarks almost solely at the Reagan administration, for failing to pursue Mideast negotiations more actively.    On economic issues, Mr. Babbitt remained a sharp critic of his colleagues. He accused Mr. Dukakis of &quot;flim-flamming&quot; in dealing with the federal deficit, and suggested that even Sen. Simon's proposed public-jobs programs couldn't hire enough auditors to find the billions in uncollected taxes that Mr. Dukakis's fiscal program would depend upon.    In one new wrinkle, Sen. Simon suggested expanding service to millions of poor households without telephones, financed by a 2% tax on long-distance calls. The Illinois Democrat returned to his old image of the compassionate, Trumanesque candidate, and except for one sharp exchange with Mr. Babbitt, seemed content to sit back and issue short, general statements.    The more combative Sen. Gore criticized former Sen. Hart's vote for a moratorium on deploying U.S. missiles in Europe, but Mr. Hart faulted the senator for accepting too much of the administration's foreign policy in an effort to make himself look &quot;strong.&quot;    Questioned by a student, Mr. Hart denied any wrongdoing in financing for his campaign, which has been accused of violating elections laws. Over the weekend, Mr. Hart said money that proved to be contributed illegally would be returned. </TEXT></DOC>
