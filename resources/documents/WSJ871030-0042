The Bartlesville, Okla., oil company said it expects its world-wide reserves to be up slightly from 1986 levels, based on Sept. 1 data.    Phillips said revised estimates of oil and gas reserves are largely responsible for the increase, but it also cited discoveries of new reserves and extension of existing fields through additional drilling. Last year, Phillips said its world-wide reserves fell 6%, primarily because of asset sales.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Phillips closed at $11.375 a share, up 75 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
