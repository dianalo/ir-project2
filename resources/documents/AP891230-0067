InFlorida, people who want to dive for scallops will have to buy alicense. In Illinois, the Tully monster will become the officialfossil.   These and scores of other new laws take effect around the nationJan. 1.   In several states, new measures are going on the books that dealwith gun control, alcohol, drugs and smoking.   California has a law inspired by the January attack on aStockton schoolyard, in which Patrick Purdy gunned down fivechildren with an AK-47 semiautomatic assault rifle and then shothimself to death with a handgun. With the new law, military-styleassault weapons identified on a special list will be severelyrestricted. The list contains some 55 pistols, rifles and shotgunsthat will be barred from manufacture, importation or sale.   Maryland will bar sale of handguns unless they are on a list ofweapons approved by the Handgun Roster Board. That law is aimed atso-called ``Saturday night specials.''   ``Nobody said we were going to stop crime if this occurred,''said state Police Superintendent Col. Elmer H. Tippett. ``We onlysaid that it was a start to get some of this junk off the street.''   Oregon gun buyers and people seeking licenses to carry concealedhandguns will face stiffer identification requirements andbackground checks.   In New York, a new law aims to curb underage drinking. Policewill be able to issue a $50 summons to people under 21 for merepossession, instead of purchase, of alcohol.   ``It will certainly help neighborhoods where raucous parties goon and destroy the neighborhood's tranquility,'' said Doris Aiken,a Schenectady woman who founded Remove Intoxicated Drivers. ``Kidsat Cornell University would stand in the street with beers in theirhand and wave at the police.''   But Genevieve Connor, vice president for campus affairs for theState University of New York Student Association, said ``a law likethis would make people potentially the victims of arrest justbecause they're carrying a six-pack of beer.   ``They may be going to make stew, who knows?''   Two states are imposing new crackdowns on drunken drivers. InConnecticut, police officers will be permitted to revoke on thespot the license of a driver who fails a blood-alcohol test. InCalifornia, it will be a crime to drive with a blood alcoholconcentration of .08 percent or greater, toughened from .10 percent.   As part of the war on drugs, Connecticut is offering some youngmale drug offenders ``boot camp''-style punishment. The state willspend $10 million on the program, which will also includecourt-ordered wilderness school sentencing for certain juveniledrug offenders.   A Florida ``drug-free workplace'' law championed by Gov. BobMartinez says that law enforcement officers, firefighters and``safety-sensitive'' state employees may be tested for illegaldrugs when hired or when they undergo physical examinations. Thelaw does not require the testing and bans random testing.   Illinois students will be forbidden to carry or use beepers onschool property because the devices are often associated with drugdealing.   New York's ``Clean Indoor Air Act,'' touted as the nation'stoughest anti-smoking law after Minnesota's, prohibits smoking inauditoriums, elevators, gymnasiums, food stores, shared taxicabsand limousines, and restricts it to certain areas in largerrestaurants and other public facilities.   In Greensboro, N.C., smokers will face the toughest restrictionsin that state, the nation's No. 1 producer of flue-cured tobacco.Voters in November narrowly approved the new ordinance, whichrequires restaurants to set aside 25 percent of their seats fornon-smokers and bans smoking in retail stores that can accommodatemore than 200 people.   The elephant law in California stems from the 1988 case of an8,000-pound pachyderm named Dunda at the San Diego Wild AnimalPark. The animal was ``subjected to two days of beatings whichcaused apparently severe injuries and trauma to the head area,''according to a city attorney's report. Zoological society officialsacknowledged the beatings, but said the elephant needed to bedisciplined.   Florida's first recreational saltwater fishing license isexpected to raise $6.5 million for fisheries and marine research inits first year. It will cost $12 for Florida residents and $30 forthose from out of state.   ``What were once unlimited natural resources are being depleted,and I think most folks who will be affected recognize thatadditonal revenue is needed to enhance the resources,'' saidRichard Healey, deputy director of the Florida Marine Patrolsupport services.   But state Sen. Vince Bruner said many fishing boat captains inhis Panhandle district fear they will lose business to neighboringstates.   Illinois' new official fossil, known formally as theTullimonstrum gregarium, is about a foot long, has a snout like anelephant's and is 300 million years old.   ``I've handled a lot of heavier legislation in my time, but thiswas one that I was delighted to do,'' state Rep. Larry Wennlund,who sponsored the legislation at the behest of the son ofdiscoverer Francis Tully.   Here is a look at some other new laws:   ALASKA: Increases residency requirement from six months to twoyears to qualify for the dividend given to each citizen fromAlaska's $10 billion oil-wealth savings account. It is expected toeliminate about 60,000 newcomers from the list. This year'sdividend was $873.   TEXAS: Requires anyone possessing a wild animal such as a lion,tiger or bear, for ``breeding, exhibition, or personal use'' toobtain a $100 permit.   NORTH CAROLINA: Makes it a misdemeanor to take or sell a labeledmilk crate. Dairies complained that crates were being snatched bypeople looking for convenient carriers or low-budget furniture.   GEORGIA: Makes it illegal to heavily tint car windows. Lawofficers worry about the risk of approaching a car without beingable to see the occupants.   CALIFORNIA: Requires state government agencies to answer theirtelephones by the 10th ring. The law contains no provision forpenalizing violators.</TEXT></DOC>
