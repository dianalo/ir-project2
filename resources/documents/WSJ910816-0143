They boasted that due to &quot;free-market&quot;reforms initiated by President Carlos Andres Perez, nocountry in Latin America was better suited for investmentthan Venezuela. No doubt this is true for these men, who overthe years have carefully nurtured political connections thatinsure a successful mix of capital, protection and avoidanceof red tape. But investment opportunities in Venezuela arenot available in a general way that would lead to an overallrise in the standard of living. Opportunities for success arestill concentrated in a few well-placed hands.   Ironically, the man at the helm in Venezuela who now touts&quot;capitalist&quot; reforms was, just 15 years ago, touting&quot;socialist&quot; reforms and predicting the same &quot;liberating&quot;results. And in the end, the beneficiaries of both &quot;reform&quot;movements tend to be the same familiar faces. &quot;The morethings change, the more they remain the same&quot; is a phrasethat applies nowhere better than in Venezuela.</LP><TEXT>   When President Perez, during his first tenure as president(1974-1978), expropriated the oil companies, the wealth wasto be distributed among all Venezuelans. I still remember onthat New Year's Day, 1976, the beaming faces of thepolitical, business and union elites invited to celebrate theglorious action, pushing and pulling to shake the president'shand. The foreign capitalists had been vanquished. The sloganbecame: &quot;The oil now belongs to us.&quot;   Fifteen years later, there can be little doubt that &quot;us&quot;referred to the few well-connected people who got their handson oil revenue. The rest of us suffered. The overall standardof living in Venezuela has dropped to early 1950s levels. Butnot for the elite. In just a decade -- between 1974 and 1983-- oil exports provided the government with an income of $112billion, which was poured into grandiose state enterprises,feeding a widespread corruption never before seen in thiscountry of 19 million people.   Since the oil income seemed insufficient to carry on thestatist agenda, a foreign debt of $29 billion was incurredfrom 1975 to 1982, happily encouraged by irresponsibleinternational bankers who knew that such funds were destinedfor political subsidies, money-losing state enterprises andthe crushing of private initiative. Of the total publicforeign borrowing, 55% was referred to as deuda nocontratada, or &quot;uncontracted debt.&quot; A better term would havebeen &quot;illegal debt.&quot; This was supposed to be short-term debt,but nine years later most of it remains outstanding.   Most of the uncontracted debt was incurred by large statecorporations, like the electric and aluminum companies. Butpractically no records were kept of this debt. Venezuela hadto rely later on the accounting of 421 foreign banks tofigure out the extent of its arrears. No Venezuelan officialwas ever jailed for this crime against present and futuregenerations.   Part of the post-nationalization political agenda was thefinancing of newcomers to protected industries, under theimport substitution scheme favored by the U.N. EconomicCommission for Latin America. Billions of dollars weregranted as credits by the two principal state banks, theVenezuelan Development Corporation and the VenezuelanIndustrial Bank (BIV). The first one folded, and according toa May 1990 World Bank report, if only 7% of BIV'soff-balance-sheet guarantees were called, its net worth wouldbe wiped out.   But Mr. Perez's policy to create &quot;instant entrepreneurs&quot;went only as far as these huge cash infusions for those withconnections. He did not lower barriers to allow free accessto markets by newcomers. Quite the opposite: for two decades,industrial projects had to be reviewed by bureaucrats of theDevelopment Ministry, who tended to approve those schemesthat had the blessing of the party bosses or that came with abig enough check to allow distribution all along thepolitical gravy train. Credits by government banks weregranted the same way. And once large credits were obtained,many &quot;party-member entrepreneurs,&quot; lost interest in theprojects, sold them or simply took off with the funds. Theforced &quot;democratization&quot; of the Venezuelan business class wasthus a total failure.   The concentration of political and economic power in thesame hands -- a state of affairs initiated the day privateoil companies were dispossessed -- had catastrophicconsequences. Corruption soon invaded the judicial system.Judges were chosen not for their integrity or knowledge ofthe law, but because of their political connections.Positions on the bench were to conform to the relative powerof different political parties. Thus, judicial decisions --with a few honorable exceptions -- can be expected to followthe desires of the party or to be open to the highest bidder.   Not only is it highly unlikely a poor Venezuelan will wina case; in all probability he won't even reach a courthearing unless he has a sponsor in the corridors of power. OnJuly 22, 1987, the first and only census published by theMinistry of Justice stated that of 27,869 inmates inVenezuelan prisons, only 10,045 had been convicted.Venezuelan law does not allow for freedom under bail. It isestimated today that over 70% of those in jail have notreceived sentence, in a country whose political leaders oftenshout about breaches of human rights abroad.   The elected rulers of Venezuela ignore the fact that therule of law is at least as important as the right to vote.But equality under the law is a radical concept that wouldchallenge the legitimacy of long-enjoyed privileges. That iswhy privatization in Venezuela indulges in vigorous rhetoricwhile hardly advancing at all.   Some of the smaller state-owned banks, hotels, sugarmills, airlines, ports, water utilities, the phone companyand other shockingly inefficient enterprises will be sold.But to suggest that oil, steel, aluminum and other basicindustries be privatized is to show &quot;unpatriotic feelings,&quot;even though these institutions are shameless wastrels. Lastmonth, Venezuela's controller general revealed that an auditof CADAFE (the electric distribution company) determined thatone-third of the electricity distributed from 1988 to thesecond semester of 1990 had not been billed. This amounted toover $190 million] Imagine GM forgetting to invoice one-thirdof the cars it shipped to its dealers. Nevertheless, CADAFEand the electric generating company EDELCA are &quot;basic&quot;industries, and thus immune to privatization.   Venezuela cannot be expected to emerge from the dark agesof socialism mixed with crony-capitalism before a thoroughreform of its legal system takes place. A return to the ruleof law, and away from the rule of political bosses, combinedwith the economic entitlement of the common man would amountto a real democratic revolution. One thing that we havelearned about economic development is this: Unless economicopportunity is available to all budding entrepreneurs in agenuinely competitive, open market, the society as a wholecan not be considered investment-grade material.   ---   Mr. Ball, a Venezuelan journalist and former editor inchief of a Caracas newspaper, is president of AIPE, aneconomic news feature and syndication service for LatinAmerican newspapers.</TEXT></DOC>
