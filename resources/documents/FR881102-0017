However, Michigan's submittal of April 25, 1979, contained additionalregulations which were not required under the CAA's Part D SIP requirements.Therefore, at the time of USEPA's May 6, 1980, final rulemaking, USEPAdecided to defer rulemaking and indicated that a separate rulemaking noticeaddressing these elements would be prepared.The State of Michigan submitted the rules which are the subject of thisnotice on April 29, 1979. These rules are Rule 336.1310 (Open Burning);R336.2101-336.2199 (Continuous Emission Monitoring); R336.2301-336.2308(Air Pollution Episodes); R336.2601-336.2608 (Organization, Operation andProcedures); and R336.2701-336.2706 (Hearings). These rules have been ineffect at the State level since January 18, 1980.On January 15, 1988, USEPA sent the State of Michigan a letter addressingthese rules. In response to USEPA's letter, the State submitted a letteron February 22, 1988, requesting USEPA to continue processing these ruleswith the exception of the sulfur dioxide compliance date extension rules336.1501-336.1507.<ITAG tagnum="84">1. Open Burning</ITAG>Michigan's Rule 336.1310 limits the open burning of materials. It prohibitsopen burning of waste, refuse, garbage, or any other waste materials withthe five exceptions presented below. These exceptions do not authorizeopen burning where prohibited by local law or regulation.(a) Waste disposal of material from one or two-family dwellings where theburning does not violate any other Commission rules.(b) Structures and other materials used exclusively for fire preventiontraining if prior approval is obtained from the Commission.(c) Trees, logs, brush, and stumps in accordance with applicable stateand local regulations if the burning is not conducted within a PriorityI area as listed in Table 33, a Priority II area as listed in Table 34,nor closer than 1400 feet to an incorporated city or village limit andthe burning does not violate any other Commission rule.(d) Beekeeping equipment and products, including frames, hive bodies, hivecovers, combs, wax and honey when burned for bee disease control.(e) Logs, brush, charcoal, and similar materials for the purpose of foodpreparation or recreation.Regulatory ActionUSEPA approves Michigan's Rule 336.1310 as an acceptable additional elementof Michigan's current federally approved SIP. This rule reduces the particulatematter concentrations and other products of combustion throughout the stateand it in no way relaxes control requirements contained in the approvedMichigan SIP.<ITAG tagnum="84">2. Continuous Emission Monitoring (CEM)</ITAG>Under section 110(a)(2)(F) of the CAA, States must submit a plan for theinstallation of equipment by owners or operators of stationary sourcesto monitor emissions from these sources. Michigan submitted sixteen rules:336.2101; 336.2102; 336.2103; 336.2150; 336.2151; 336.2152; 336.2153; 336.2154;336.2155; 336.2159; 336.2170; 336.2175; 336.2176; 336.2189; 336.2190, and336.2199 which address the requirements related to CEM. The requirementsof these rules are summarized below. USEPA prepared a technical supportdocument (TSD) dated October 1, 1987, which contains an analysis of theseCEM rules.Rule 336.2101Michigan's Rule 336.2101 requires fossil fuel-fired steam generators toinstall, calibrate, maintain, and operate CEM for opacity, sulfur dioxide,nitrogen oxide, oxygen and carbon dioxide.

USEPA believes that theserules meet the specific requirements and guidelines of section 110(a)(2)(F)of the CAA and the minimum emission monitoring criteria specified in 40CFR Part 51; Appendix P.<ITAG tagnum="84">3. Air Pollution Episodes</ITAG>Under 40 CFR 52.11, States are required to submit to USEPA as a SIP revisiona plan that provides for public announcement concerning air pollution emergencyepisodes. Michigan submitted 8 rules, 336.2301-336.2308, which addressair pollution episodes.Rule 336.2301Michigan's Rule 336.2301 defines ``air pollution episode'' as a conditionthat may lead to, or result in, the buildup of atmospheric contaminantsin the State, or any part thereof, which adversely affect the health ofthe people.Rule 336.2302Michigan's Rule 336.2302 defines ``air pollution forecast'' as a nationalweather service advisory, or local equivalent, that an atmospheric stagnationcondition exists.Rule 336.2303Michigan's Rule 336.2303 defines ``air pollution alert'' as a concentrationof contaminants at which control actions begins.Rule 336.2304Michigan's Rule 336.2304 defines ``air pollution warning'' as a level whichindicates that air quality is continuing to deteriorate and that additionalcontrol actions are necessary.Rule 336.2305Michigan's Rule 336.2305 defines ``air pollution emergency'' to mean thatair quality is continuing to deteriorate to a critical level and that themost stringent control actions are necessary.Rule 336.2306Michigan's Rule 336.2306 discusses the declaration of air pollution episodes.Rule 336.2307Michigan's Rule 336.2307 discusses episode emissions abatement programs.Rule 336.2308Michigan's Rule 336.2308 discusses episode orders. The rule states thatwhen an air pollution episode has been declared, the Commission may ordera source of air pollution to put into effect the applicable episode emissionabatement program.Regulatory Action USEPA is approving Rules 336.2301-336.2308 since the regulations conformwith the minimum criteria for air pollution emergencies or episodes specifiedin 40 CFR Part 51; Appendix L and 40 CFR 52.11. <ITAG tagnum="84">4. Organization, Operations and Procedures </ITAG>Michigan submitted Rules 336.2601-336.2608 which address organization,operation and procedures. Rule 336.2601 Michigan's Rule 336.2601 discusses organizational structure and responsibilitiesof the air pollution control commission.

These are State requirements only and were adopted pursuant to Act348 of the Michigan Public Acts of 1965.  <ITAG tagnum="84">5. Hearings </ITAG>Michigan submitted Rules 336.2701-336.2706 which outline procedures forpublic hearings. Rule 336.2701Michigan's Rule 336.2701 discusses procedures required by Michigan's AdministrativeProcedures Act. Rule 336.2702Michigan's Rule 336.2702 discusses the service of notices and orders; aswell as appearances at a hearing or proceeding.

Rule 336.2706Michigan's Rule 336.2706 discusses commission hearings after hearing commissionerhearings. Regulatory Action USEPA is approving Rules 336.2701-336.2706 for incorporation into the MichiganSIP. These regulations are State and Federal requirements, which were adoptedpursuant to the Michigan Administrative Procedures Act described in section11 of the Act No. 34 of the Michigan Public Acts of 1965, and section 110(a)(1)of the CAA. Because USEPA believes today's action to be noncontroversial and routine,we are approving it without prior proposal. This action will become effectiveJanuary 3, 1989. However, if we receive notice by December 2, 1988, thatsomeone wishes to submit comments, then USEPA will publish: (1) A noticethat withdraws the action, and (2) a notice that begins a new rulemakingby proposing the action and establishing a comment period. Since this noticecontains more than one type of regulation, USEPA requests that commentorsidentify the exact regulation subject to the comment. USEPA will withdrawrulemaking action and repropose action only on the portions receiving comments.Under Executive Order 12291, today's action is not ``Major''. The Officeof Management and Budget has exempted this rule from the requirements ofsection 3, Executive Order 12291. Under 5 U.S.C. 605(b), I certify that this SIP approval action will nothave a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.Under section 307(b)(1) of the CAA, petitions for judicial review of thisaction must be filed in the United States Court of Appeals for the appropriatecircuit by January 3, 1989. This action may not be challenged later inproceedings to enforce its requirements (See section 307 (b)(2)). <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 52 </ITAG>Air Pollution Control, Carbon monoxide, Hydrocarbons, Incorporation byreference, Intergovernmental relations, Lead, Nitrogen dioxide, Ozone,Particulate matter, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements, Sulfur oxides.<ITAG tagnum="21">Date: August 26, 1988. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Lee M.
