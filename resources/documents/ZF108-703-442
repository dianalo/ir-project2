ZimmermanandM;After an 18-month journey, the Magellan space probe is set to begin its orbitaround Venus this week and start its four-year task of surveying the surfaceof the cloud-shrouded planet.andM;Scanning Venus' heat-seared landscape via radar, the probe will send anestimated 500 gigabytes of topographical and geological data back to Earth,where it will be carefully sorted, organized and cataloged by a network ofDOS PCs, Digital Equipment Corp.andP;  VAXes and a ShareBase Inc. database server.andM;The network, installed at the California Institute of Technology's JetPropulsion Laboratory (JPL) in Pasadena, Calif., replaces the piecemeal --and infinitely more time-consuming -- mainframe-based system the facilityused to monitor data from previous unmanned space missions.andM;&quot;This is the first mission that has this central facility,&quot; said Jeff Miller,chief of the Data Management and Archive Team (DMAT) at JPL, which isoverseeing the Magellan information retrieval under contract with NASA.andP;  &quot;Wehope to prevent some of the problems that have happened in previousmissions.&quot;andM;The mainframe system did not give researchers a systematic way of collatingthe huge volume of data a space probe collects.andP;  Scientists are still tryingto catalog the reams of data received during the Voyager II flight pastJupiter in 1979.andM;&quot;The mainframe computer is good for collecting volumes and volumes of data,but it's not too good at the real-time critical analysis that the Magellanmission requires,&quot; said Todd Sambar, tools programming manager of technicalmarketing at ShareBase in Los Gatos, Calif.andM;The JPL setup relies on a central cataloging system that runs on ShareBase'sModel 300 database server linked to a network of 16 DOS-based PCs and fiveVAXes.andM;Three VAX minicomputers will process the gigabytes of radar images, altimetryand gravity measurements sent home to Earth by Magellan 16 hours a day, sevendays a week for the next four years.andP;  Two MicroVAXes will be used to displayand process radar images.andM;Using Vermont Creative Software Inc.'s Vermont Views toolbox software, DMATprogrammers wrote custom inventory and processing applications in C to sortthrough the data and break it up logically, then assemble the informationinto catalogs.andP;  The VAX software will eliminate data redundancies andidentify gaps in the data.andM;The data will then be processed into high-resolution images of the planet'ssurface, which can be assembled and compressed into complete mosaicphotographs and topographical maps.andM;The ShareBase system, an intelligent database processor equipped withShareBase's database-management software and a hard-disk capacity of 600Mbytes, will be used to manage the data catalog after it is processed by theVAXes, Miller said.andM;Once the data is sorted, researchers and engineers will be able to easilyaccess it with a custom menu-oriented querying application from 286 and 386PCs, connected to the ShareBase server and the VAXes through asynchronouscommunication lines.andP;  All of the machines run the DECnet network operatingsystem.andM;With the information collected, the scientists and researchers will searchfor clues as to what makes Venus' atmosphere so hostile and so unlikeEarth's.andP;  Previous space-probe landings have shown that the planet's surfaceis subjected to crushing atmospheric pressures and temperatures over 900degrees Farenheit.andM;&quot;This information,&quot; said Miller, &quot;will help us either confirm or deny currenttheories about the Earth's origin.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
