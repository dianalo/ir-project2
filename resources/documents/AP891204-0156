They organized the Reform The Armed Forces Movement in 1985 tooppose corruption in the military under the late PresidentFerdinand Marcos, who was driven into exile and replaced by CorazonAquino.   Of six coup attempts against Mrs. Aquino, they are known to haveplotted those in November 1986, August 1987 and the past weekend.   The ``RAM Boys,'' as they are known here, have come to believeher administration represents the same nepotism, and corruption asthe Marcos government.   On Saturday, they issued a manifesto demanding that Mrs. Aquinoresign to open the way for a referendum on what form thearchipelago's government should take.   It accused her of pursuing the ruinous policies of herpredecessors and of not initiating social and economic reform. TheRAM officers have claimed Mrs. Aquino favors leftists and coddlesCommunist rebels while ignoring the interests of the armed forces.   RAM emerged when officers unfurled a banner during graduationexercises at the Philippine Military Academy saying ``We Belong.''They were described as ``Born Again Soldiers,'' committed torestoring discipline and professionalism.   Members include some of the best officers, including former Lt.Col. Gregorio ``Gringo'' Honasan, a charismatic figure who led thecoup attempt in August 1987 and is believed to be a leader of thisone.   Their political philosophy seems not unlike that of Italianfascists in the 1920s: Society should exchange hurly-burly politicsfor an orderly, disciplined approach to solving national problems.   Mrs. Aquino prefers consultation and public debate that producesa consensus she can accept. She tends to rely heavily on peoplewhose primary qualification is loyalty to her or her husband,Benigno Aquino Jr., who was shot to death when he returned fromself-imposed exile in the United States.   Robert Lee, a young RAM lieutenant, appeared on a commandeeredtelevision station during the August 1987 coup attempt to proclaimhis movement's goals. He said Philippine society suffered from``too much politics'' _ endless debate without resolution.   The RAM clique became associated with Juan Ponce Enrile, thendefense minister, because of mutual opposition to Gen. Fabian Ver,military chief of staff to Marcos.   Ver, a distant relative of Marcos, had circumvented the chain ofcommand by his relationship with the president and his wife,Imelda, and underminded Enrile's position as defense chief.   He had solidified his power by appointing supporters to seniorcommands, regardless of merit, so RAM officers looked to Enrile.   In 1985, as the Marcos administration weakened, RAM officersbegan plotting to replace his government with a junta that wouldimpose discipline and order on a chaotic society.   RAM sources say they planned a coup for late 1985, but delayedit after Marcos called a presidential election for February 1986.   When Marcos used fraud to steal the election from Mrs. Aquino,RAM issued a statement saying the ``will of the people'' had beenfoiled.   Plans were made for a coup, in which soldiers in rubber boatswould cross the Pasig River and storm the presidential palace, butVer learned of the plot and ordered Enrile and others arrested.   The defense minister found out and withdrew to militaryheadquarters in Camp Aguinaldo with his ``boys'' and declaredopposition to Marcos.   His declaration did not win over enough units to assure success,so Enrile and Lt. Gen. Fidel Ramos, then deputy chief of staff,appealed to Cardinal Jaime Sin and opposition groups.   Hundreds of thousands of people heeded the cardinal's call tofill the streets and protect the mutineers. The price was adeclaration from the military leaders of support for Mrs. Aquino.   Members of RAM always have felt they were denied power that wasrightfully theirs. They risked careers, families and lives to oustMarcos, but Mrs. Aquino and her advisers, many of themanti-military, got the rewards.</TEXT></DOC>
