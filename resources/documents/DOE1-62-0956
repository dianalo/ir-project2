The response to an electrical stress instantaneouslyapplied across a fast ion conductor, which has been represented by asingle relaxation time in the previous paper is actually quite complex.The decay of the perturbation is not exponential and the departure fromexponential decay differs from one glass to another. Also it is verydifferent for electrical relaxation and mechanical relaxation (in whichthe decay of a tensile or torsional stress is followed).</TEXT></DOC>
