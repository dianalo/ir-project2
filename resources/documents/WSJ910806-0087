Despite Republican denials, reports of such a secret dealhave circulated for years and focus on a series of allegedmeetings in Europe between Iranian representatives and thelate William Casey, who was Mr. Reagan's 1980 campaignmanager and later director of the Central IntelligenceAgency. The 52 hostages who were held 444 days were releasedon the day of Mr. Reagan's inauguration, and some of thehostages have been prominent in calling for an investigation.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;These allegations are both persistent and disturbing,&quot;said Speaker Thomas Foley in a joint statement with SenateMajority Leader George Mitchell. &quot;We have no conclusiveevidence of wrongdoing, but the seriousness of theallegations and the weight of circumstantial informationcompel an effort to establish the facts.&quot;   House and Senate foreign affairs committees will becharged with the inquiry, and no decision on public hearingswill be made until the first stages of the investigation arecompleted. &quot;President Bush and President Reagan have all saidthat they did not object to an inquiry that was fair andimpartial,&quot; Mr. Foley told reporters. But the announcement issure to provoke criticism and partisan jockeying foradvantage in the makeup of the committees responsible for theinvestigation.   House Minority Leader Robert Michel dismissed the inquiryas a politically driven &quot;charade&quot; and waste of tax dollars.&quot;There's nothing there,&quot; said the Illinois Republican of theallegations. &quot;And the people back home don't give two hootsabout it.&quot;   Rep. Lee Hamilton (D., Ind.), who chaired the HouseIran-Contra Committee four years ago, will lead the Houseinquiry, which will take the form of a special task forcewithin the House Foreign Affairs Committee. The Senate willrely on an existing Foreign Relations subcommittee for theNear East chaired by Sen. Terry Sanford (D., N.C.), thoughRepublicans could alter the membership of the panel, givenits sudden prominence.   Such jockeying -- in both parties -- will undoubtedly be afactor in shaping the makeup of the House task force underMr. Hamilton. Like Sen. Sanford, Mr. Hamilton already chairsa subcommittee with jurisdiction over Mideast affairs. But bygoing with a task force, Democrats are quietly making aconcession to the GOP and giving Mr. Michel more of a voicein choosing who will represent his party.   Unlike Iran-Contra, where entirely new panels wereestablished in both houses, the Democratic leadership hasshown more deference to the exisiting committee structure.This approach has the advantage of avoiding the need for aspecial resolution authorizing the inquiry. Instead, theinvestigations can proceed using the power of the standingcommittees to subpoena documents and records and taketestimony under oath.   For all the partisan stakes, Mr. Foley has approached theinvestigation reluctantly and recognized that establishingclear answers will be difficult. The paper trail of travelrecords is incomplete, and the inquiry is hampered by thedeath of not only Mr. Casey but also of Cyrus Hashemi, anIranian arms dealer with whom he allegedly met in 1980. Mr.Hashemi's brother, Jamshid, has described meetings betweenMr. Casey and Iranian representatives regarding the timing ofthe hostages' release. In addition, a major question mark isIran, which may prove unwilling to cooperate in an inquiry sosensitive to Republicans who control the White House andState Department.</TEXT></DOC>
