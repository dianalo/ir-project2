This problem was solvedas follows: The electric resistance was reduced by mixing thermosettingresin and graphite powder to form the carbonizing substance; the mechanicalstrength was improved by adding carbon fiber chops; further, a surfaceactive agent was added to improve the surface adhesion between the electrodeand separator in order to raise the adhesion strength.
