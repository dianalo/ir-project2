Sales for the giant West German chemicals company dropped 9%, to $5.29 billion from $5.81 billion. Results in 1986 were restated to conform to new accounting procedures adopted by European Community countries.    Analysts said Bayer's results reflected a continuation of the concern's stable growth pattern and a consolidation of the group. They said the steady trend should continue despite the mark's strength against the dollar, which was reflected in the sales decline. The company said sales were stable in terms of volume.    Bayer linked the earnings rise to increases in non-operating profit but said that operating results for the first quarter fell slightly because of foreign-currency fluctuations. Its president, Hermann J. Strenger, said 1987 earnings would remain high, but he didn't rule out a further drop in sales.    Bayer announced it is selling its U.S. agricultural-chemical subsidiary, Helena Chemical Co. Bayer has doubled its sales force in the U.S., awaiting regulatory approval of two drugs it hopes to launch in the next six months. Mr. Strenger also announced plans to expand Bayer's presence in Japan, which is the second-largest chemicals market after the U.S. He said the concern will apply for a listing on the Tokyo Stock Exchange for 1988. </TEXT></DOC>
