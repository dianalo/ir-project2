The restrictions, which must be approved by the House and Senatebefore being sent to President Bush, would cover practically all ofthe 16,000 airline flights scheduled in the United States each day.   By the estimate of tobacco industry lobbyist Charlie Whitley,the rules would allow smoking on about 55 flights daily. LobbyistJo Ellen Deutsch of the Association of Flight Attendants said shethought smoking would be permitted on fewer than 20 flights a day.   ``This isn't even a compromise,'' said Nancy Hailpern, lobbyistfor the American Cancer Society, one of many health groups thatfought to expand current anti-smoking rules. ``We're using the wordcompromise basically for the benefit of the other side.''   ``With few exceptions, every airline passenger in America nowcan look forward to smoke-free travel,'' said Rep. Richard Durbin,D-Ill., who helped write the measure.   Durbin and Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., who championed anairline smoking ban in the Senate, predicted the legislation wouldbe approved by Congress.   ``I don't think we'll have a bit of a problem,'' Lautenberg said.   The tobacco industry was battered in Congress this year when onAug. 2, the House voted 259-169 to make permanent the currentsmoking ban on flights of two hours or less.   On Sept. 14, the Senate voted 77-21 against cigarette-statelawmakers' effort to prevent adoption of even stricter rules. TheSenate then passed a permanent ban on all flights by a voice vote.   With those defeats behind them, tobacco interests had to acceptwhat they could get.   Whitley, a former Democratic congressman from North Carolina,said of the adopted language, ``As much as it preserves, we'll takethat.''   Flights from the West Coast to Hawaii and Alaska are scheduledfor less than six hours and would be covered by the ban, Lautenbergand others said. Uncovered would be non-stop flights to thosestates originating in the central and eastern United States.   The prohibition would also apply to flights to or from U.S.possessions in the Caribbean, but not to Guam.   The current prohibition on smoking during short flights covers80 percent of U.S. routes. Those restrictions are scheduled toexpire in April 1990. The new rules will take effect 95 days afterthey are signed into law.   The provision is part of an $11.9 billion transportation measurefor fiscal 1990 which House-Senate negotiators are still trying tocomplete.   During bargaining lasting several hours, Lautenberg initiallysaid he would insist that if House negotiators did not adopt theSenate language, he would force the House to vote on his proposal.He said he believed he would have prevailed on the House floor.   But after House Whip William H. Gray III, D-Pa., and severalothers objected, Lautenberg accepted the compromise offered by Rep.Martin Sabo, D-Minn.   ``I just felt it was a long, a very, very long time for peoplenot to be smoking,'' Sabo said, referring to the flights lastingmore than six hours.   Senate negotiators accepted the compromise without voting. The11 House bargainers adopted the language on a show of hands. Therewas no official vote count, but the only member seen voting againstit was Rep. Jamie Whitten, D-Miss.</TEXT></DOC>
