Pindling isbeing investigated by two U.S. grand juries probing payoffs by drugtraffickers, The Washington Times reported today.   The newspaper, quoting sources it did not identify, said grandjuries in Miami and Jacksonville, Fla., have heard testimony fromwitnesses who claim Pindling received payments from cocainetraffickers to ensure safe passage of the drug through the Bahamas.   Pindling, in an interview with the Times, denied the allegation.He said the Bahamian government has been working for years to stemthe flow of illegal drugs.   ``The allegations against me are not true,'' he said. ``I wouldhate to think that anyone truly believes I am a crook.''   A spokeswoman for the U.S. attorney's office in Miami did notreturn telephone inquiries Wednesday about the case, the newspapersaid, while a spokesman for the federal prosecutor's office inJacksonville declined to comment.   The Times said documents it had inspected indicated that,between January 1977 and December 1983, Pindling deposited into hispersonal banks accounts $3.5 million over his official income asprime minister.
