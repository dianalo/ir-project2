Rancho Seco began shutting down just hours after residents in theSacramento Municipal Utility District voted June 6 to pull the plugon a 15-year-old plant that suffered a history of expensivebreakdowns and poor management.   Anti-nuclear groups hailed the ballot result, and some suggestedit could prove a catalyst for citizen initiatives against othernuclear plants. But early indications are that the fallout will bemuch less dramatic.   ``The circumstances with Rancho Seco were unique to Rancho Seco,so we're not going to have a domino effect,'' said Scott Denman,director of the Safe Energy Communication Council, aWashington-based group opposed to nuclear power.   He added, however, that because it focused on the economics ofnuclear power, the Rancho Seco campaign may lead to broader interestin alternative sources of energy, such as solar power, and effortsto make more efficient use of all energy supplies.   Thus in the longer run, he said, the Rancho Seco vote may proveto be a milestone.   ``We tend to think it's the last flapping of the tail after thefish has been pulled from the water,'' he said.   Industry supporters say Rancho Seco was an aberration, notingthat 15 other citizen initiatives against nuclear power prior to theRancho Seco case failed. They see no indication that the publicwants to throw out nuclear power.   ``We think that Rancho Seco was not a vote against nuclear power,but a vote against the way that plant was run by upper management,''said Scott Peters, a spokesman for the U.S. Council for EnergyAwareness, a pro-nuclear group.   The nuclear industry has been stagnating for more than a decade,partly because of public wariness about safety and partly because ofeconomic problems. No utility has ordered a new nuclear plant since1978 and many nuclear supporters agree with critics that no ordersare likely before the turn of the century.   ``I don't know of a single chief executive officer in ourindustry that would bet his company on a nuclear plant,'' saidWilliam McCollam Jr., president of the Edison Electric Institute, atrade group of privately owned utilities.   He called the Rancho Seco vote ``not good for the publicperception of nuclear power.''   Many nuclear plants are run efficiently, but those that are nothave blackened the industry's image.   Rancho Seco had a poor record, producing less than 40 percent ofthe electricity that would have resulted from unfailing year-roundoperation _ far below the industry average. The utility district hadto double its rates over the past four years to pay for plantimprovements that cost more than the reactor itself.   John Ahearne, a former chairman of the Nuclear RegulatoryCommission, said he didn't expect the Rancho Seco vote to trigger arash of citizen moves against nuclear power. He said the shutdownexposed an important weakness in the industry: the inability orunwillingness to force a poor-performing plant to change its ways.   ``The industry knew very well that this was a terrible plant,''he said, yet it turned a blind eye and in effect allowed nuclearcritics to strengthen their hand.   Several other U.S. nuclear plants are suffering from poorperformance, and the NRC, which regulates the nation's 109 operatingreactors, says it's losing patience with some of the laggards.   Earlier this month, the NRC raised the possibility of taking theextraordinary step of closing down two reactors at the Turkey Pointpower station in Florida because of poor performance. The reactorshave been on the commission's list of worst-run nuclear stationssince it began the rating system in 1986.   In Maryland, the Calvert Cliffs nuclear plant has fallen into arapid decline. Less than two years ago it was given rave reviews byan international inspection team. Now it is listed by the NRC asamong the worst-run U.S. plants. The plant shut down its tworeactors in May because of mechanical problems, creating a revenuedrain and prospects of power shortages in the Baltimore area.   Despite these and other problems, the nuclear industry faces aless vocal public opposition than in the immediate aftermath of the1979 reactor accident at Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania, whichwas the most severe in U.S. history.   There is relatively little organized campaigning, for example, toclose Turkey Point or Calvert Cliffs. Even the Peach Bottom nuclearplant in Pennsylvania, which was closed down for about two years bythe NRC after control room operators were discovered sleeping on thejob in 1987, faces little local opposition.</TEXT></DOC>
