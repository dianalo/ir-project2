The proposal, included in Mr. Gorbachev's opening speech to a historic party conference here yesterday, goes far beyond what he has previously said by outlining for the first time how he intends to carry out his promise to divide party and state. That division is central to his idea of instituting &quot;democracy&quot; into the state to assist the process of reform while retaining a one-party system to preserve Communist power.    Mr. Gorbachev proposed that the party, which he would continue to head, would set the direction of policy. But all administrative affairs of government would be the responsibility of a new full-time executive body that would replace the country's part-time, rubber-stamp parliament, perhaps as early as next spring. The new body would elect a president, presumably Mr. Gorbachev, who would be in charge of carrying out social and economic legislation, as well as deciding major issues of foreign and security policy.    Mr. Gorbachev's reforms would revamp the present system by creating a 2,250-member body elected by the entire population -- party members and non-party members -- known as a &quot;Congress of People's Deputies.&quot; It, in turn, would elect a two-chamber Supreme Soviet, with one chamber representing the numerous nationalities in the Soviet Union and the other representing various interest groups such as artists and trade unions.    The presidium of the new Supreme Soviet would consist of the president, chosen by the Congress of People's Deputies, representatives from each of the 15 Soviet republics and members of a type of state auditing committee known as &quot;people's control.&quot;    The current Supreme Soviet, or national parliament, has been under fire in the media over the past months as an ineffective and amateurish body.    &quot;It is this ossified system of government,&quot; that hampers economic reform, Mr. Gorbachev told the 5,000 party delegates. &quot;Today we must have the courage to admit that if the political system remains immobile and unchanged, we will not cope with the tasks of 'perestroika,'&quot; he said of his attempt to reform the Soviet economy. In his speech to the party conference, the first of its kind in 47 years, Mr. Gorbachev conceded that the Soviet economy is in much worse a state than he originally thought.    If all goes according to plan, the conference will vote on wide-ranging political reforms intended to give ordinary Soviet people a greater voice in running their country. Mr. Gorbachev hopes that this will boost his popular support and weaken the grip of party and state officials, the bureaucrats he blames for paralyzing his economic reforms. He already has proposed setting limits on the terms of party and state officials and making the officials subject to election by secret ballot.    If the reforms are adopted and instituted as planned, they almost certainly would weaken the position of Mr. Gorbachev's conservative opponents in the party. &quot;Unquestionably, there will be some redistribution of power,&quot; Alexander Yakovlev, a politburo member and key Gorbachev supporter told a news conference.    Throughout his speech yesterday, Mr. Gorbachev appeared anxious to calm his conservative critics and unify the party behind him. Responding to conservatives' alarm at the growing media disclosures about the abuses of Josef Stalin, Mr. Gorbachev appeared to meet their concerns half way by conceding that the disclosures are distressing. &quot;It would have been much simpler not to know,&quot; he said.    The conservative bent of the party delegates was underlined by the rare instances of applause during the first half of Mr. Gorbachev's speech: once when he ruled out the establishment of any opposition parties and again when he told delegates that &quot;Democracy is incompatible with wantonness, irresponsibility, or permissiveness.&quot; Later, the delegates seemed more supportive.    While Soviet officials decline to guess at the loyalties of the delegates, Mr. Gorbachev's hopes of packing the conference with his most ardent supporters appear to have failed. Perhaps this explains his attentiveness to conservatives' concerns since he will need their support to ensure that conference decisions go his way. The conference is expected to last several days.    Mr. Gorbachev sought to reassure conservatives by remaining vague about what would happen to the party's policy-setting central committee once his reforms are in place. Many of its functions presumably would be taken over by standing committees attached to the new parliament. He pledged that instead of a big purge of party ranks, people regarded as &quot;deadwood&quot; would be given a chance to reform.    Although the bulk of his speech was devoted to political reform, Mr. Gorbachev again pledged new measures to overcome economic problems. He said the party leadership had underestimated the state of economic neglect and complained about a growing budget deficit &quot;that is pressing down upon the market, undermining the stability of the ruble . . . and giving rise to inflationary processes.&quot;    Soviet politicians usually deny the existence of inflation in the country, and the frank admission of a budget deficit also was unusual. But Mr. Gorbachev didn't give any numbers.    The Soviet leader also said a new law is being drafted to regulate more strictly an important part of his economic reform package known as &quot;state orders.&quot; These govern how much of a company's output can be taken by a ministry. Soviet economists have complained that ministries are taking far too much, leaving companies little to sell elsewhere.    Apart from its new form, Mr. Gorbachev made clear he expected the proposed new parliament to adopt a radically different style of working. &quot;Its sessions should do away with long-winded speeches, with statements in which the speaker reports on his own accomplishments,&quot; he said. </TEXT></DOC>
