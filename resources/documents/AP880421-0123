Moreover, although researchers say it's hard to tell for sure,those juicy fast-food hamburgers probably are leaner than theysometimes look.   Overall, the Texas Aandamp;M study found the amount of visible orseparable fat was down 27 percent in retail cuts from two yearsago, and the fat content of ground beef was down 10 percent.   The study, which was released Wednesday by the AgricultureDepartment, involved supermarket surveys in late 1987 and early1988 in Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, Denver, Detroit, Houston, LosAngeles, New York City, Philadelphia, Seattle, Tampa, Fla., andWashington, D.C.   Randomly selected retail beef cuts contained an average of 78.9percent separable lean, 11.7 percent separable fat (3.3 percentexternal fat and 8.4 percent ``seam'' or intermuscular fat), and9.4 percent separable bone and connective tissue.   The weighted average of fat content of all retail beef cuts inthe 1988 survey was 9.99 percent, compared with 13.76 percent fatin 1986.   H. Russell Cross of Texas Aandamp;M told a news conference that whileAmericans like beef, their perception is that it's a fatty product.   Earlier studies showed ``marked improvement'' in consumerperception when the outside fat on retail cuts was trimmed toone-quarter inch of fat or less, compared with the previousstandard of one-half inch. Most retailers began using thequarter-inch fat trim after 1985.   ``The reduction in separable fat meant that long-standingassumptions on amounts of fat Americans were getting from beefperhaps were not correct'' and that more up-to-date information wasneeded, Cross said.   As a result, the USDA's Agricultural Research Service put up$20,000; the Cattlemen's Beef Promotion and Research Board,$20,000; and the Beef Industry Council, $5,000 for the new study.The project was administered by a foundation of the NationalCattlemen's Association.   Jeff Savell, a Texas Aandamp;M colleague, said the study found thatmore than 40 percent of the retail cuts had no external fat.   The average fat thickness on steaks and roasts from primal cuts,or the major wholesale cuts, was 0.14 inch, while the average forall cuts, from chuck roast to stew meat was 0.11 inch, or less thanone-eight of an inch, he said.   ``We found that the amount of beef fat in American supermarketmeat cases on a given day is now 1.2 million pounds less than informer years,'' Savell said. ``That's 4{ billion fewer calories.''   A committee of the National Research Council recently reportedthat Americans are eating too much fat and urged the industry andgovernment to help correct the situation by breeding leaner animalsand changing federal grading regulations.   Cross said the latest survey showed that in the case of beef theless-fat recommendation of the scientific panel is being carriedout.   ``The next step in the war on fat is to trim more of the fat atthe packer level, where it can be done more efficiently,'' he said.``Eventually, we must depend less on butchers' knives to get rid ofthe fat and more on production of leaner cattle.''   Further changes are needed in the marketing system so thatcattle producers are rewarded financially for turning out cattlewith less trimmable fat, he said.   Cross said the impact of leaner beef on fast-food hamburgers isdifficult to determine.   ``First, we need to realize that the fast-food ground beef isprobably not as fat as you might expect,'' he said. ``The averagefat content is probably somewhere between 18 and 20 percent for thefast-food hamburger, whereas the average for this study was rightaround 19 percent.''   That doesn't mean your favorite juicy burger at the localdrive-in is leaner than the meat bought at supermarkets.   ``There's essentially three kinds of hamburger that are normallyoffered at retail _ regular, which is around 23 or 24 percent fat;lean, which is around 18 or 19; and extra-lean, in this study,which was around 14 to 15,'' Cross said. ``So, fast-food groundbeef is right in the middle of the pack.''</TEXT></DOC>
