The Soviets' goal is to produce quality goods and services that are competitive with those of other nations.    While the Soviets appear to recognize the need for a more competitive economy, the U.S. is considering measures to restrict corporate restructurings -- proposals that are the antithesis of laissez-faire capitalism and that threaten to impair American competitiveness.    The U.S. has developed through a process that might be called &quot;continuous perestroika,&quot; or an ongoing restructuring of the economy from farming to manufacturing to services. Entire industries have been able to renew themselves, but only because there have been few barriers to prevent this evolutionary process.    America's rapid industrialization during the 19th century was stimulated by those vilified as &quot;Robber Barons.&quot; They built the railroads, steelworks and oil refineries before early restrictive legislation slowed the nation's rapid economic expansion.    Mergers and acquisitions in the U.S. have been particularly potent forms of continuous perestroika, fueling economic growth in the early 1900s. The buyouts, takeovers and consolidations that gave birth to such industrial giants as U.S. Steel, General Motors, Union Carbide and ATandamp;T represent important milestones in the modernization of the economy. The most recent mergers-and-acquisitions wave, which began earlier this decade, has resulted in some of the most dramatic productivity and employment gains ever experienced by the U.S.    Corporate takeovers are probably the most controversial element of American perestroika, eliciting calls for restrictive legislation. They are frequently regarded as destructive of companies, jobs and communities.    Yet a closer look suggests takeovers have stimulated and enriched the economy. The threat of takeovers motivates management to make efficient use of resources. Maximizing stock price through effective performance is management's best takeover defense, since those companies undervalued by the market due to poor management are the likeliest takeover candidates.    Studies have shown the significant economic benefits of takeover activity. Joseph Grundfest, a commissioner of the Securities and Exchange Commission, recently found that shareholders of companies acquired in hostile takeovers earned nearly $140 billion in profits between 1981 and 1986. These profits become investment capital that is recirculated in the economy to spur more economic growth.    Economists have identified two broad categories of takeovers. The first are &quot;disciplinary&quot; takeovers where the acquirer seizes the opportunity offered by a company's poor stock market performance. This is likely to be the result of ineffective management practices such as wasteful spending, excessive growth and diversification, poor long-term planning and little Randamp;D. After the takeover, the acquirer imposes new management and operating standards to improve performance.    The second type of takeover is &quot;synergistic,&quot; in which the acquiring firm is motivated by possible benefits from the combination of the two companies' businesses. The objective is to enhance business through a complementary relationship.    It's no surprise that disciplinary takeovers tend to be hostile and synergistic takeovers are often friendly. A National Bureau of Economic Research paper found that hostile targets, compared with other Fortune 500 firms, are &quot;smaller, older, more slowly growing, have . . . more debt and invest less of their income&quot; and also have a lower percentage of management ownership. Target companies in synergistic takeovers are just the opposite: They grow faster, invest more in development and have a larger percentage of management ownership.    Much of the anti-takeover legislation that either is before Congress or has been enacted on the state level places restrictions on &quot;disciplinary&quot; takeovers. But these play an important role in perestroika by forcing ineffective, entrenched managements either to run their companies more efficiently or to relinquish control.    Recent proposals by Congress for a &quot;corporate raiders tax&quot; could seriously hamper corporate restructuring and were certainly a factor in the stock markets' massive sell-off. Fortunately, the magnitude of the crash appears to have given lawmakers pause for a second look. In any case, the event underscored the markets' fundamental faith in the benefits of the perestroika process.    It would be ironic if the U.S. imposes barriers to the industrial restructuring that has been the foundation for the economy's strength. The result ultimately would be a logjam requiring a major upheaval to redress -- something like the perestroika now under way in the Soviet Union.    ---   Mr. Balog is vice chairman of Drexel Burnham Lambert. </TEXT></DOC>
