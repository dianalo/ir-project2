The two discussed the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks,implementation of the treaty to eliminate medium-range superpowernuclear missiles, and the size of the respective armed forces, saidHoward.   They also discussed U.S. allegations that the Soviets violatedthe 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty by building a phased-arrayradar far from the Soviet border in Siberia, said Howard. The pactrequires such radars to be along the border.   Howard declined to give full details of the talks, saying thatCarlucci and Yazov reserved that right for news conferences bothplan at the end of the talks Thursday.   Opening the morning session at the U.S. Embassy, said Howard,Yazov ``commented that the room ... was a very small room, and saidthere is a saying in Russian that although we have close quarters,we shouldn't quarrel.''   ``Everyone got a laugh out of that,'' said Howard.   ``The main point that Mr. Yazov made in the beginning was thathe wanted to have useful discussions without having the pressure ofnegotiations ... to arrive at some sort of agreement,'' Howard said.   Carlucci welcomed Yazov to the opening round.   Inside, the two men, flanked by about 10 aides apiece, facedeach other across a long table at the end of which stood a reliefmap of Europe, the area defended by the opposing forces of theNorth Atlantic Treaty Alliance and Warsaw Pact.   The two men exchanged greetings, but made no public remarks. Itwas the first ever business meeting between U.S. and Soviet defensesecretaries.   Reporters and photographers were ushered out of the room as thefirst, three-hour session began.   Carlucci and Yazov ate lunch at the residence of U.S. AmbassadorFaith Ryan Whittlesey before the afternoon session at the Sovietembassy.   On Thursday, Carlucci and Yazov were to eat breakfast at theresidence of Soviet Ambassador Zoya Novozhilova before their thirdand concluding session. Carlucci told reporters earlier that hehoped Yazov could give him concrete evidence of a highly publicizednew Soviet military doctrine.   Despite extensive Soviet press commentary on the Kremlindoctrine of reasonable or defensive sufficiency, he said he hadseen seen ``absolutely no practical change.''   ``If anything, their military continues to grow. They continueto modernize,'' Carlucci said Tuesday.   Yazov said before he left Moscow that he hoped for ``frank,constructive discussion'' on arms control issues includingstrategic arms, nuclear testing, chemical and conventional weapons.   Carlucci emphasized that he did not want the meeting to open a``parallel channel'' to on-going superpower arms negotiations inGeneva.   Soviet journalists covering the session said they had been toldit was likely to produce no dramatic announcements, but to serve asan ``impulse'' to other negotiations.</TEXT></DOC>
