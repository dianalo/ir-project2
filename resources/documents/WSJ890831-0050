The Lincoln, Neb., maker of scientific and pollution monitors also said that revenue for the year is expected to be &quot;slightly higher&quot; than the year-earlier revenue of $29.9 million.    The company attributed the lower earnings to increased sales expenses and higher research and development costs. Isco also said its instrument division has been hurt by soft market conditions, which have resulted in a more competitive environment. Isco said that although the &quot;soft conditions&quot; may continue into fiscal 1990, it is optimistic about its long-term future. </TEXT></DOC>
