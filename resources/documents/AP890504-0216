However, the scientist who compiled the notebooks, Dr. TherezaImanishi-Kari of Tufts University, testified that they had nothingto do with the published report of her experiments and showed only``I am not a neat person'' and ``I am very bad at dates.''   Asked by the chairman of the investigations subcommittee of theHouse Energy and Commerce Committee, Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., toexplain Secret Service findings that a page dated Aug. 18, 1984,had been written on a pad beneath a page dated May 18, 1985, shesaid she might have waited to May to record data taken the previousAugust.   ``What possible motive would I have to cheat?'' she said. ``Ihave lupus. My sister died of lupus. ... If I had fabricated datait would have mislead science to waste its scarce resources'' beingused to find cures for such diseases.   Other scientists and co-authors backed up her claim that thedisputed notebooks did not bear on the controversial 1986 paper inthe scientific journal Cell, which the subcommittee has beenlooking into for more than a year.   One of Dr. Imanishi-Kari's co-authors, Nobel prize winner Dr.David Baltimore, accused Dingell of indulging in ``a classic casecase of verdict first, evidence later'' in the seven-hour hearing.   Baltimore, a professor of molecular biology at MassachusettsInstitute of Technology, accused the subcommittee staff of notbeing fair after Dingell expressed ostensible dismay that the majorauthors of the paper declined to respond to an informal staffbriefing last week.   ``It's as if we had presented you with the Cell paper and askedyou to analyze it on the spot,'' Baltimore said.   The Cell paper explored the workings of the immune system inmice bred to have an immune system gene from another species.   Allegations that notebook data did not support the paper, firstmade by Margot O'Toole of Dr. Imanishi-Kari's lab, wereinvestigated by the National Institutes of Health, which paid forthe research. An NIH consultants' panel concluded that no fraud ormisrepresentation had been committed, but errors were made that theauthors should correct.   The authors have written one correction letter to the journaland are preparing another.   James Wyngaarden, the outgoing director of the NIH, told thesubcommittee that he has now ordered a re-opening of theinvestigation based on a new allegation from Ms. O'Toole, that datawere missing to support one of the figures of the Cell paper. Dr.Imanishi-Kari said, however, that the scientist involved, Moema H.Reis, now at the Biological Institute in Sao Paulo, Brazil, hadreported recording the missing data directly on the figures.   John W. Hargett, chief document examiner for the ForensicServices Division of the Secret Service, said analysis of the paperand ink of two looseleaf notebooks showed ``At least one page inthe ... book which was presented to us as having been prepared in1984 was not prepared in 1984, but was more consistent with the1986 book. Four other pages in all probability were all preparedaround the same time as the 1986 pages'' and 20 other pages werequestionable.   At least two dates appeared to have been changed, Hargett said.   Health and Human Services Secretary Louis Sullivan announcedThursday that two offices have been established within the PublicHealth Service to strengthen its ability to deal with scientificmisconduct.   An Office of Scientific Integrity Review will be located at HHSin the office of the assistant secretary for health and willestablish overall policies and procedures for dealing withscientific misconduct.   An Office of Scientific Integrity at the National Institutes ofHealth in Bethesda in suburban Washington, D.C., will monitorinvestigations into scientific misconduct conducted by institutionsthat receive Public Health Service funds for biomedical orbehavioral research. It will also conduct its own investigations.</TEXT></DOC>
