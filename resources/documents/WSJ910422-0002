Here's   A Scientist's Answer:   Blow Up the Moon   ---   Prof. Abian Says It's Time   To Rethink the Cosmos;   Others Say That's Lunacy   ----   By Judith Valente   Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DATE>04/22/91</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A1</SO><IN>ENVIRONMENT (ENV)</IN><LP>   AMES, Iowa -- Oh, sure, the moon seems nice enough. Itilluminates dark nights, makes a wonderful backdrop forlovers and has inspired some fine poetry. &quot;What is there inthee, Moon, that thou shouldst move my heart so potently?&quot;pondered Keats.   But there's a definite dark side to the moon, too, says anIowa State University mathematics professor named AlexanderAbian, and he's not just talking about werewolves. Accordingto the professor, the moon is the source of lousy weather onEarth. So, he says, we should blow it up.</LP><TEXT>   That's right. Blow it up. If the moon's a balloon, weshould pop it. No more moon over Miami. No more moonlightserenade. No more moon hitting your eye like a big pizza pie.   Clearly, there's no amore lost between Prof. Abian and themoon. He says he's making this suggestion with the utmostgravity. In fact, he says that's exactly the problem. Themoon, he says, exerts a pull on earth that helps tilt theglobe on a 23-degree axis. That, in turn, alters the anglethat rays from the sun hit earth, causing scorching summersin one part of the world and stormy winters in another. Ifthe moon were gone, earth would rotate more evenly, the sunwould warm the planet more evenly and the world would bask inwhat Prof. Abian calls &quot;eternal spring.&quot;   Mr. Abian is no lunatic. He's a respected 68-year-oldmathematician who has three theorems named after him,including Abian's Order Relation and Orthogonal Completionsfor Reduced Rings. He has taught at Iowa State for 24 yearsand has published more than 200 papers. He says it's time toquestion the existing order of the solar system and wantsscientists to start devising computer models on how torearrange the universe.   &quot;From the earliest traces of primate fossils some 70million years ago, no one, but no one, has ever raised thefinger of defiance to the celestial organization,&quot; he says.&quot;We have been like blind slaves obediently being rotatedwithout our consent.&quot; A reduction of the mass of the moon,splitting the moon into two or more pieces or what he calls a&quot;controlled total elimination&quot; of the moon would haveimmediate effects on earth's weather, he says.   How to accomplish this? Shoot the moon, quite literally.Blast it with nuclear-powered rockets. The moon's distancefrom earth, about 240,000 miles, would keep any nuclearfallout from contaminating the planet, Prof. Abian says. Plusit would make a great show for a few minutes.   Wouldn't blowing up the moon melt the polar ice caps andcause massive flooding? No, the professor says; ice at theNorth and South Poles would simply melt more evenly. Whatwould happen to the tides, which the moon governs? They wouldbe &quot;more predictable, with much less fluctuations,&quot; he says.   And, most important, what about love? Prof. Abian brushesoff the notion that a moonless earth would be a less romanticone. &quot;In some cultures, the moon is associated with uglinessand plainness,&quot; he says. &quot;In Russian, there is even anexpression: `To be as dull as the moon.'&quot;   Anyway, he says, once human beings learn the secrets torearranging the universe, scientists will be able to pluckmoons from other planets and bring them closer to earth --but not so close that they interfere with weather. &quot;To thoseromantics, I say, `OK, you love the moon? I will give youtwo.'&quot;   Outlandish as this may be, his ideas are actually sparkinginterest in scientific circles. &quot;The task seems to befeasible and we have many reasons to take it up,&quot; beams JanKadrnoska of the Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences, one ofseveral foreign scientists who has written seeking moreinformation from Prof. Abian.   But while scientists concede that Prof. Abian's &quot;eternalspring&quot; theory may have some theoretical validity, they alsosay it's a bad idea to fool Mother Nature. &quot;We all know whatare the consequences of many other projects when a man triedto intervene in the natural course of events,&quot; warns SovietProfessor E.M. Drobyshevski. Still, Prof. Drobyshevski sayshe would be willing to pursue Prof. Albian's ideas &quot;withgreat pleasure&quot; because Soviets suffer some of the worstwinters on Earth.   There are other problems, too. &quot;I'd hate to write theenvironmental impact statement on this one,&quot; says BevanFrench, a lunar expert at the National Aeronautics and SpaceAdministration and the author of a book all about the mooncalled &quot;The Moon Book.&quot;   Mr. French thinks several aspects of Prof. Abian'sproposal are a bit out of this world. He disputes whether thetechnology exists to eliminate even a portion of the moon.Even if it did exist, it would first have to be testedsomewhere closer to home, he says, &quot;and I don't think thepeople on earth would like that much.&quot;   And what if a large chunk of the moon ending up hittingearth, Mr. French asks. &quot;Sixty-five million years ago, a mereasteroid hit the earth and wiped out the whole dinosaurpopulation,&quot; he notes.   Not only that, but Lowell Smith, a senior scientist withthe Environmental Protection Agency, worries that the use ofnuclear force to blow up parts of the moon would probablyviolate treaties between the U.S. and the Soviets.   Environmentalists are also concerned about what wouldhappen to living things such as the poor Palolo worms of theSouth Pacific. The worms rise from the ground to mate onlyduring full moons in October and November. And what about thegrunions, those sardine-shaped fish that live in the seas offCalifornia? They spawn their eggs on sandy beaches duringcertain lunar cycles.   Prof. Abian, who has also taught at Oxford and Ohio State,dismisses such concerns. &quot;It has never been proven that ourlife on earth depends on the presence of the moon,&quot; he sayswith an agitated wave of the hand.   An intense man with a half-moon of wispy white hair, Prof.Abian is no stranger to contrariness. He once considered acareer as a classical pianist, but refused to play musicalpieces the way their composers intended. &quot;If a passage calledfor &quot;pianissimo&quot; {very soft}, I'd want to play it&quot;fortissimo&quot; {very loud}. I knew I'd never succeed.&quot;   But the reaction to his proposal, from an angry publicthat seems positively moonstruck, eclipsed anything he couldimagine. He first published his ideas in Abstracts of theAmerican Mathematical Society. Since then, he was interviewedby a German television station and two London newspapers andwas featured in a supermarket tabloid with the front-pageheadline: &quot;Scientists Plot to Blow Up the Moon.&quot;   Karen Clute, a teacher at Mound Elementary School inMiamisburg, Ohio, took up the issue with her fourth gradersafter reading about Prof. Abian's ideas in Omni, a sciencemagazine. Their overwhelming response: To the moon, Alice. &quot;Idon't want to hurt your feelings, but the moon is by mywindow every night. My little sister loves the moon and so doI,&quot; Danielle Sugarman wrote to the professor.   She also suggested that having nice weather all year longcould get a bit boring. &quot;If a child was born and had neverseen snow in his or her life, how do you think they'd feel?&quot;she asked.   But among older students -- Prof. Abian's -- the tideseems to be turning in his direction. &quot;His theory has beenwidely misrepresented,&quot; says Paul Hertzel, a doctoralstudent. &quot;He's not simply suggesting 20th-century man blow upthe moon. He's saying don't be stagnant. Consider everything.Question everything.&quot;   Indeed, &quot;they laughed at Galileo and Copernicus in theirday too,&quot; Prof. Abian likes to remind others. &quot;The fact ofthe matter is, the genius of mankind will not tolerate beinghostage to the earth's existing orbit forever.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
