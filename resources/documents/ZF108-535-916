Jackson Blvd.,andO;#504, Chicago, IL 60604; (800) MONOTYP, (312) 855-1440.andM;List Price: $99 to $265 per package (four to six fonts per package).andM;Requires: PostScript printer that reads Type 1 fonts.andM;In Short: Finally, the original Monotype fonts (some of which aren'tavailable in any other PC format) have been made accessible to desktoppublishers.andM;Much of the best in 20th-century typography is the work of The MonotypeCorp., the English firm that created Times Roman and other classic faces.andO;Until now, desktop publishers had access to little more than pale copies ofMonotype's work.andP;  Many of the most popular fonts now in use in PostScript andLaserJet printers share the same names as Monotype's typefaces but lack theircharacteristics vigor and elegance.andM;With the release of the Monotype Typeface Library by Monotype Typography,desktop publishers can finally use Monotype's originals.andP;  Some of theseclassic faces, like Bembo, Plantin, Poliphilus, and 20th Century, aren'tavailable in any other PC format.andP;  Others, like Monotype Baskerville andTimes New Roman--despite the name, the original version designed by StanleyMorrison in the early 1930s--are available only in less polished versions,some of them barely recognizables as Times Roman.andP;  The Monotype TypefaceLibrary, nearly 100 packages of PostScript Type 1 fonts ranging in price from$90 to $265, also includes a healthy collection of script and display faces,and recent designs like Photina.andM;Compared with many of Adobe's designs, especially the early ones, Monotype'sfonts look notably less &quot;homogenized&quot; and simplified.andP;  Adobe, for example,has a &quot;Times Ten Roman&quot; based on Linotype's licensed version of Times NewRoman that has looser character widths and less-subtle curves than theMonotype version.andP;  (Curiously, only the Linotype version retains the curvedlower stroke of the italic &quot;z&quot; that Monotype used in 1932 but simplified to astraight line shortly afterward.)andM;Monotype licenses the Type 1 technology from Adobe, and uses Adobe's softwaretools to create hinted fonts that will work with any PostScript printer ortypesetter that handles the Type 1 format.andP;  But Monotype chose not to makethe slight adjustments to letterforms that Adobe recommends for the mosteffective use of hints at low resolution.andM;For example, Adobe might prefer to realign the nodes of a curve along avertical axis rather than a slightly slanted one, but Monotype chose to letthe curve stay as it was, even if this meant a slight roughening of the edgesof a letterform at small sizes on 300-dots-per-inch printers.andP;  In practice,thanks to recent improvements in Adobe's hinting technology, any rougheningis barely noticeable.andM;However, when Adobe issues its cross-licensed versions of the Monotypelibrary later this year, you may find slight adjustments to the letterformsfor the sake of smoother edges at low resolution.andP;  If you use a 300-dpiprinter with an early version of Adobe's PostScript interpreter for yourfinal output, you may want to compare the Adobe and Monotype versions to seewhether you prefer added smoothness or more exact letterforms.andP;  But you can'tgo wrong with Monotype's version if you get your final output from animproved Adobe interpreter like the one in the new Hewlett-Packard PostScriptCartridge for the LaserJet III (which has the added benefit of the III'sresolution enhancement technology), or if you use a service bureau thatprints at 1,270 or 2,540 dpi.andM;Many of Monotype's faces have optional &quot;expert sets&quot; with old-style&quot;lowercase&quot; numerals, true small capitals, ligatures, and fractions.andP;  Theseuse the same character set pioneered by Adobe with Adobe Garamond, but whichAdobe only provides or its own original designs.andP;  Monotype provides expertsets for Baskerville, Bembo, Ehrhardt, Perpetua, and Plantin, with more tocome.andM;Monotype will also provide faces that overcome the major limitation ofcurrent desktop technology--the use of a single design for all sizes of atypeface.andP;  In hot-metal typography, the proportions of a face were differentin large and small sizes.andP;  Large sizes used proportionally thinner strokes,and small sizes had a higher x-height (the relative size of lower-caseletters like &quot;x&quot; and &quot;a&quot; and the bowls of &quot;b&quot; and &quot;p&quot; compared to the heightof letters like &quot;l&quot; and &quot;h&quot;).andM;Sometime in the future, fonts using the Apple/Microsoft True Type technology(formally code-named Royal) will automatically change proportions atdifferent sizes.andP;  Until then, typographers need different designs fordifferent sizes, yet virtually all typeface vendors have preferred to supplya single scalable design.andP;  Casual users prefer the efficiency of a singlescalable face, but typographers know that the results are inadequate anywherebeyond a narrow range of sizes.andP;  To solve the single-design compromise,Monotype has announced (but hasn't yet shipped) supplementary packagesdesigned for small sizes of Times New Roman, and further packages are on theway.andM;Installing a Monotype package is a straightforward task, although you have toinsert a separate program disk for each package rather than use a singleprogram disk for multiple packages, as in Adobe's recent releases.andP;  TheMicrosoft Windows installation procedure assumes that you're going todownload fonts before using Windows.andM;If you want Windows applications to download fonts for you, you'll have tomodify WIN.INI.andP;  The trick is to add a comma and the name and path of the PFBfiles (the fonts themselves) immediately after each entry for the PFM files(the font metric file that Windows uses internally).andP;  A WordPerfect driverwill be released by the time you read this.andP;  Whichever program you use themin, the Monotype fonts will make anything you print look like something worthreading.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
