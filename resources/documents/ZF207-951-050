 That is the opinion of Richard Sharpe, a commentator on U.K.andO;software matters and co-editor of the London-based Software Marketsnewsletter.andM;The U.K.andP;  computer services market, estimated to do some $9 billion per year,is considerably smaller than the U.S.andP;  market.andP;  Outside of customizedprogramming, an important market, software suppliers have a viableopportunity in three sectors: defense, telecommunications and applicationsaffected by national legislation (such as payroll and local government),Sharpe said.andM;A cherished belief that bedevils software suppliers here is that U.K.andO;software engineers are superior to other nations' staff and that U.K.andO;software suppliers lack the access to capital needed to bring products tomarket.andM;&quot;I think the former is a myth and the latter is not really significant,&quot; saysSharpe.andP;  &quot;The key factor is the possibility of achieving critical mass in thehome market and only those sectors described really allow it.&quot;andM;The result is that most software companies well-known in the U.K.andP;  arescarcely known outside it, and are insignificant in size when judged byAmerican standards.andP;  If U.K.andP;  software enterprises wish to rank on theinternational scale, they must penetrate their home market significantly andthen expand overseas, observers agree.andM;That has been the formula for the largest U.K.-based software companies,which market observers identify as Logica of London, and SD-Scicon,headquartered in Fleet, Hampshire, England.andP;  Both firms have their strengthin custom programming projects and are major players in the sectors mentionedby Sharpe.andP;  Both also derive a large part of their revenues from overseas.andM;Historically, commercial packages have never been a forte of the U.K., withperhaps one or two exceptions.andP;  Altergo (now absorbed within Thorn EMI) madea splash with its Shadow TP monitor in the 1970s, but drowned when IBMtightened CICS.andM;CICS itself could be claimed as a U.K.andP;  package success.andP;  While CICSoriginated in the U.S.andP;  in 1969, development work moved to IBM's U.K.andO;laboratories in Hursley in 1974.andP;  Hursley is also home to IBM's PresentationManager interface for OS/2, software which should boost the visibility oflocal software development talent.andM;METIER FOCUSED ON APPLICATIONSandM;One worldwide U.K.-based company success story is Metier, with worldwideheadquarters in Hayes, Middlesex, England.andP;  The firm's Artemis planning andcontrol project management package runs on IBM mainframes, the Sperry 5000,DEC VAX machines, Hewlett-Packard minicomputers and PCs; a Unix version isscheduled for release in early 1990.andM;Founded by Richard Evans and partners in 1975, Metier was generating $85million in worldwide revenues when it was sold to Lockheed in 1985 for $120million.andP;  Lockheed is currently in the process of divesting Metier; a newowner is expected by the end of 1989, a company spokesman said.andM;In 1988, metier's worldwide revenue was $100 million, with 40% attributed tosoftware sales, 40% to maintenance and support and 20% to consultingservices, the spokesman said.andP;  The U.K.andP;  ranks just behind the U.S.andP;  marketin revenue contribution to the company, according to the spokesman.andP;  TheHouston, Texas-based U.S.andP;  branch, Metier Management Systems, Inc., isresponsible for North and South America.andM;Evans got his start with the Timesharing Ltd. service bureau in London, whichconcentrated on the need for applications rather than use of machine time.andM;He built up trade around a rudimentary database system designed on relationallines (pre-Ted Codd, the acknowledged father of relational database theory),linked to a project management package which produced Pert charts.andP;  Seeing aneed for a simple online resource management system, Evans left the bureau.andM;Refinement of the idea and the discovery, in 1975, that it could now beimplemented on a minicomputer (a necessary 20Mb of disk was just aboutavailable then) led to the founding of Metier and development of the Artemispackage.andM;The database and Pert modules, although the core of the system, were not thereal added value; this was applied by the addition of cost, resource andmaterials management modules.andM;At the time, industry was tooling up for North Sea oil exploration, and thatis where Metier had its initial successes in the U.K.andP;  But the oil industry,and civil engineering more generally, is essentially international.andM;FOLLOWED OIL TO HOUSTONandM;Metier put its cash reserves and staff on the line, and went for the U.S.andO;via an office in Houston in 1977.andP;  It was not easy but the company ended upwith around 40% of the U.S.andP;  market, initially by targeting the oil industryin Texas.andM;When the oil industry soured, Metier shifted into the aerospace and defenseindustries, in part by targeting NASA, also located in Houston.andP;  Artemis, forexample, is used to schedule payloads and refurbishing work for NASA's spaceshuttle.andM;Customer satisfaction (Evans is a quality control fanatic) and theinternational nature of the enterprises have taken Metier around the world.andO;Artemis is used on projects that were generally very large.andP;  Because itprovides close control over materials and overall costs, it often translatesinto dramatic financial success.andM;&quot;The critical element,&quot; says Evans, &quot;was online control, which nobody else atthe time provided.andP;  It's the nature of large projects that you stumble aroundfrom crisis to crisis.andP;  Having to wait two days for results from batchproject management systems, with maybe the whole project grinding to a halt,could be horrendously expensive.andM;&quot;Getting immediate feedback and being able to 'what if' on the spot could beworth a gold mine, so the system wasn't too price-sensitive,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;Thatallowed us to accumulate the cash to tackle the other half of the world--theU.S.&quot;andM;Evans considered that Timesharing Ltd. was ahead of U.S.andP;  bureaus in itsthinking.andP;  But the home market did not allow him to grow large enough to riska shot at the U.S.andP;  only the product's international success allowed him tolook to the U.S.andM;Wanting to do other things with their lives, Metier's founders have sincemoved on.andM;The story of Metier is worth recounting because it remains the sole, realU.K.andP;  success story in the international commercial package marketplace.andP;  Hadthe founders chosen to stay in the game, they could now own the biggest U.K.andO;software company.andM;The story also illustrates a point made by Dough Eyeions, director general ofthe U.K.andP;  Computer Services Association, based in London.andP;  &quot;You have toremember that the U.S.andP;  accounts for over half of the international softwaremarket,&quot; Eyeions said.andP;  &quot;Even if you manage to get into that marketsuccessfully, its size will gradually pull your center of gravity there.andP;  Sothe price of success is to become American.&quot;andM;SD-SCICON LARGEST FIRM TODAYandM;The largest U.K.andP;  software company now is SD-Scicon, although it is not a&quot;pure&quot; software house, since some of its revenues come from its consultingarm.andP;  SD-Scicon was formed from a merger between SD-Scicon and SystemsDesigners, completed earlier this year.andP;  Both were already sizeableoperations--Systems Designers was particularly strong in the defense marketand SD-Scicon had similar strengths in other industries.andP;  Most of the workundertaken by both companies involved bespoke (custom) programming.andM;Last year, the company reported revenues of $440 million.andP;  Significantly,staff levels have remained at around 5,500 over the past three years, whilerevenues have risen $72 million during the same period.andM;The strength of SD-Scicon is spread around several countries.andP;  Approximately20% of its staff are with its GFI subsidiary in France, 20% with SCS inGermany and 20% in the U.S.andP;  To gain the critical mass necessary to play inthe world league, it needs a strong presence in Europe and the U.S.andM;In the U.K., it operates as two equally important divisions, one lookingafter defense, government and aerospace; the other covering networks,industry and energy.andP;  Most of the revenue in all sectors is accounted for bycustom programming work, with systems integration as the key.andM;Bruce Graham, SD-Scicon sales and marketing director for the defense,government and aerospace division, said, &quot;Both Systems Designers andSD-Scicon did their apprenticeship in the 1970s, growing up with the industryand gaining experience in managing projects of the size then available.andM;&quot;Contracts of over $1 million were almost unheard of then.andP;  Now there arecontracts up to and over $30 million, and to bid for those you need size anda wide range of skills,&quot; he said.andP;  The firm's consulting side concentrates onthe U.K.'s defense industry.andM;SYSTEM INTEGRATION SERVICESandM;Figuratively waving the Union Jack, Graham said, &quot;Britain, of course, has hada standard language for military systems for some time--Coral.andP;  Now Ada isthe standard for NATO and we are also seeing Unix, 4GLs and relational DBMSsbeing used more and more.andP;  However, much of our work lies in providing the'glue' that integrates elements such as these into much larger systems.andM;&quot;It is the same story in the government and aerospace sectors,&quot; he went on.andO;&quot;We are not really in the part of the market that buys standard packages forcommon administrative functions.andM;&quot;We are more likely, for instance, to be building a bridge betweenmeteorological information systems and the airlines or creating specializedsystems for the emergency services,&quot; Graham said.andM;Eric Cook, Graham's counterpart on the networks, industry and energy side,painted a similar picture.andP;  &quot;Large systems integration projects andfacilities management contracts are the key.andP;  In the first six months of thisyear, we secured nine contracts worth over $1.5 million each and that isdouble the number last year, which in turn was double the number the yearbefore.andP;  Size breeds size.andM;&quot;Also, I feel that the larger users are looking now for a long-termrelationship with a systems and software house that can look after theirneeds quite generally.andP;  Obviously, you need to be large to do that,&quot; Cooksaid.andM;&quot;The package business has some significance in our case,&quot; he continued.andP;  &quot;Wehave packages in all our business areas and ones that are particularly strongin production management and maintenance management, resulting fromconsiderable investment by SD-Scicon originally.andP;  Overall, packages accountfor about 20% of turnover.&quot;andM;Alan Davies, SD-Scicon's marketing director for Europe, agreed that largesystems integration projects were the key.andP;  But his horizon is pan-European.andO;A number of important contracts are occurring that require a presence ofstrength in several European countries.andP;  Those are likely to increase asEurope becomes more unified.andM;Davies feels that SD-Scicon is one of the very few companies that can claimto have the diversified strength.andP;  But he said the company is conscious ofthe need to extend itself to ensure growth in the future.andM;According to Davies, &quot;Apart from our obvious strength in France and Germany,we already have smaller offices dotted around Europe that have securedsignificant contracts.&quot;andP;  For example, he cited the firm's expansion intoBelgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg, and its agreement with Bull inFrance.andP;  &quot;We are working with them on the Ovide project for the Europeanparliament,&quot; he said.andM;In Italy, SD-Scicon is working on a central Electronic Funds Transfer atPoint of Sale (Eftpos) project for 17 Italian banks.andP;  &quot;Eftpos, in fact, issomething of a European phenomenon, with a lot of developments on thehorizon,&quot; Davies said.andP;  The EDI market shows promise as well; the firm hassome 70% of the U.K.andP;  market for the necessary document translation software,he said.andM;MORE OPPORTUNITIESandM;&quot;Extending our presence is a matter of consolidating our services in somecountries and timing our entry into others.andM;&quot;In France, for instance, although we are already strong, we have not reallypenetrated the industrial and manufacturing sectors significantly,&quot; Daviessaid.andM;&quot;I see opportunities for us there and, perhaps less obviously, also ingovernment and defense.andP;  France is a country in which we are adding more ofthe services that we provide in the U.K.,&quot; Davies continued.andM;The firm considers many variables when deciding where to expand.andP;  &quot;I look notjust at the size of market but at the key players and the total spent oncomputer services.andP;  About 1% is the norm for spending on computer services asa percentage of gross domestic product,&quot; Davies said.andM;&quot;However, in Germany it is only around 0.5%.andP;  In Scandinavia, it is over 1%but most is accounted by just a few large service companies.andP;  In Italy, it isaround 0.75%; and I expect us to have a significantly increased presencethere before long.andP;  Spain we are watching; the percentage there is currentlyonly about 0.3%, but it is growing fast,&quot; Davies said.andM;The main message from the U.K.andP;  perspective is clear.andP;  Size is cretical andthe home market is not large enough to sustain a software company ofsignificant size in international terms.andP;  Very few sectors can provide enoughrevenue to sustain a large software company.andM;The route to international success lies through operating at home in one ofthose few sectors large enough to fund expansion overseas.andP;  Eventual successimplies becoming American.andM;Based in Reading, England, Hugo had been involved in computing for 24 years.andO;He was a participant at the 1968 NATO conference which is credited withcoining the term software engineering.andP;  He is a consultant to the U.K.andO;Computer Measurement Group, and is a director with Computer CapacityManagement Services, Reading, England.andP;  He is also editor of bimonthlySystems Professional Magazine, published by CFA Publishing, Ltd., Henley,England.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
