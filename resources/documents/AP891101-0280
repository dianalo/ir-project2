(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Upjohn Co. announced an early retirementplan Wednesday it expected would trim as many as 350 workers fromthe company's U.S. payroll of 12,000 to 13,000 employees.   Upjohn spokesman Bob LaRue said there was no estimate of howmuch money the program would save the pharmaceutical companybecause that depends on how many workers take the retirement offer.   He said about 1,100 employees are eligible, and that 50 percentto 60 percent of them would take part in the program. About halfthe anticipated vacancies created by the retirement program mightbe filled with new workers, LaRue said.   No part of the company's U.S. business was exempt from theprogram.   ``Over the past two years, we have followed a strategy in whichwe exercised budget constraints and implemented an effectiveheadcount control program,'' Upjohn Chairman Theodore Cooper saidin a statement. ``By offering attractive terms to employees who areon the retirement threshold, we can further our strategicobjectives by accelerating our corporate restructuring.''   Employees aged 55 or older, whose combined age and experiencewith the company add up to 75, are eligible. A formula based onseniority and other matters could boost retirement pay 10 percentto 20 percent per employee.   Upjohn, which employs about 21,300 people worldwide,manufactures human and animal health products, seeds and specialtychemicals.</TEXT></DOC>
