Buying was stimulated by reports that a working group of the International Cocoa Agreement, composed of both producing and consuming country representatives, was meeting in London to determine the manner in which the cocoa group's buffer stock manager would buy cocoa beans in price-supporting operations.    Analysts said that the producer nations are seeking to have the buffer stock manager make such purchases at the market price, while consumer countries are pressing for a single fixed price at which the purchases would be made. The latter group fears that under a market price system, the buffer stock manager would, in effect, be chasing prices ever higher, the analysts explained.    Yesterday's trading also was influenced by increased buying of cocoa by chocolate manufacturers, who were attracted by recent low prices, and by some technical support as prices recently fell to near the $1,825 life-of-contract low of the March contract, which occurred last June 23, analysts said.    The impact of the London negotiations, analysts said, tended to offset the depressing effect of recent sales by the Ivory Coast, Nigeria and Brazil. &quot;The higher prices we're seeing now are likely to encourage them to sell more,&quot; one analyst said.    The agreement's statistical committee estimated world cocoa bean production for the 1986-87 season, which began Oct. 1, would amount to 1.8 million metric tons, compared with 1.9 million a year earlier.    The committee also estimated that this year's expected production will exceed consumption by only 44,000 metric tons, or less than half of last season's 106,000-ton excess. Increased world-wide consumption and lower production in the Ivory Coast account for the estimated decline, the committee said.    The committee didn't release any figures on the level of buffer stocks or other stocks in producer or consumer hands, one analyst noted.    In other futures markets yesterday:    INTEREST RATES: Bond futures prices took a breather, finishing slightly higher after giving up most of the session's gains based on technical trading factors. Treasury bond futures for March delivery traded as high as 100 21/32 yesterday as the rally that began Monday continued unabated. But bond futures hit strong technical resistance at that level and fell back on profit-taking to close at 100 1/8, up 9/32, said Jeffrey Priest, a bond trader for Miller Tabak Hirsch andamp; Co. in New York. Looking ahead, traders are focusing on tomorrow's release of November unemployment data to give direction to the bond futures market, said Jon Pedersen, director of futures trading for Swink andamp; Co., Little Rock, Ark.    PRECIOUS METALS: Futures prices rose on Swiss bullion purchases and short covering, or buying contracts to cancel earlier sales, analysts and traders said. The overseas buying &quot;was the initial trigger,&quot; said Bette Raptopoulos, senior metals analyst for Prudential-Bache Securities Inc., New York. But trading volume was fairly light, brokers said. &quot;Probably the most interesting factor in the session was that the market held its ground&quot; after Tuesday's sharp sell-off, said Craig Sloane, precious metals analyst for Smith Barney, Harris Upham andamp; Co., New York. Still, Mr. Sloane and other analysts stressed that they don't expect strong rallies anytime soon. Yesterday's action &quot;seems to suggest that the market is carving out a trading range, with $400 an ounce as the top,&quot; Mr. Sloane said. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold contracts for December delivery rose $2.90 an ounce, to $392.20; December silver prices rose 4.2 cents, to $5.39 an ounce. Meanwhile, platinum contracts for January delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange closed at $479.10 an ounce, up $3.20.    LIVESTOCK AND MEAT: Cattle and hog futures prices tumbled, while pork belly futures fell the daily limit. A seasonal slump in beef demand, combined with continuing heavy slaughtering, pushed cash beef and cattle prices lower, depressing cattle futures as well. Hog and pork belly futures also followed cash prices lower, said Jerry Abbenhaus, an analyst with A.G. Edwards andamp; Sons Inc., St. Louis.    ENERGY: Most oil futures prices edged lower in listless trading. What little action there was stemmed from locals, or floor brokers, trading for their own accounts, analysts said. &quot;I've never seen the floor as quiet as it was today,&quot; one trader at the New York Mercantile Exchange said. Many major players have stepped out of the marketplace pending next week's meeting of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, analysts and brokers noted. &quot;Everyone is running to the sidelines,&quot; said Nauman Barakat, oil analyst for Smith Barney in New York. OPEC is scheduled to meet next Thursday in an attempt to push up prices about 20% from current levels, to at least $18 a barrel. But traders are skeptical that the cartel will succeed because its members appear unwilling to cut output to make such a price increase stick. Until the OPEC meeting is completed and a price direction becomes clearer, many analysts expect oil prices to stay in a narrow trading range. </TEXT></DOC>
