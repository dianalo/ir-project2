Utilities from the coast inland to Las Vegas asked the public toreduce electricity consumption as the heat wave lingered for athird day. Heat-related power outages were scattered throughout LosAngeles on Tuesday, when electrical use set an all-time record;5,000 customers lost electricity for a few hours.   Road pavers got a double dose of heat in Texas.   ``The asphalt is 380 degrees, plus the 100 or so degrees (fromthe weather). It makes for pretty rough working conditions,'' saidDanny Jones, vice president of Jones Brothers Paving Contractors inOdessa.   High pressure, which combined to give Phoenix back-to-backall-time records of 120 and 122 degrees, abated only slightlyWednesday. The mercury topped out at another record for the date,118 in the late afternoon. The slight drop was attributed to acloud cover early in the day, the National Weather Service said.   A 57-year-old suburban Phoenix man, who was working outdoors athis home, was found unconscious by relatives. Paramedics werecalled, but the victim was dead on arrival at a hospital. His bodytemperature had reached 108 degrees, police Sgt. James Flonachersaid.   The deaths of three other people Tuesday in Phoenix also wereruled caused by the heat. Authorities in Los Angeles said a4-year-old boy died in a parked car with the windows rolled upTuesday.   An enormous, upper-level, high-pressure system over New Mexicocreated the heat wave by beating back the Pacific Ocean's normalcooling influence.   ``I liken it to a huge umbrella sitting over the Southwest andit's just baking under there, but it's not quite reaching SanFrancisco,'' said weather service meteorologist Art Lessard.   On the West Coast, the heat was on before dawn. By midafternoon,the mercury hit 109 degrees in downtown Los Angeles, 7 degrees overthe 1976 mark for June 27. Tuesday's 112-degree mark topped theall-time record of 110 degrees set Sept. 4, 1988.   The mercury topped 100 in the valleys north and east of LosAngeles, and in the deserts. Palm Springs was 116 by midafternoon.Normally balmy San Diego was a record 91.   The forecast offered no relief. The weather service said highswould be in the 100s in the inland cities and slightly lowerelsewhere through Sunday.   Los Angeles County lifeguards bolstered their forces to handlethe throngs seeking relief on the shore, where temperatures wereabout 20 degrees lower than inland.   ``We have extra personnel and we're holding them later becausewe had over 200 rescues at Santa Monica beach between 8 and 9 lastnight,'' said lifeguard Randy Degregori. Electricity use also set arecord Tuesday in Los Angeles.   The dry heat hampered firefighters.   A blaze that killed six firefighters and injured five othersspread over 15,000 acres of Arizona's most verdant pine forestWednesday and forced the evacuation of subdivisions totaling nearly800 residences.   In Southern California counties, a total of 45 homes weredestroyed or damaged in brush fires by Wednesday night.   A 125-acre fire near Hemet, in Riverside County, injured 17firefighters, some of them so badly they were airlifted to the burncenter at Sherman Oaks Community Hospital, said fire informationspokeswoman Deborah Bennett.   Although the most intense heat ever experienced in a major U.S.city lessened, Wednesday was still a bad day for motorists inPhoenix, Arizona Automobile Association operations specialist TrishZigante said.   ``We are getting a lot of tows, which is probably heating, andalso a lot of flat tires,'' Ms. Zigante said. ``Then of coursethere are the battery jumps.''   Ms. Zigante said the AAA in Phoenix averaged 700 trouble callsper weekday before Monday but had answered 1,100 to 1,200 each ofthe first two days of the week and seemed to be running near thatWednesday.   And while neither rain, nor sleet nor snow nor dark of the nightmight keep letter carriers from swift completion of their appointedrounds, the heat in Texas is.   The Postal Service told customers they might expect minor delaysin daily delivery because carriers would be taking more breaks todrink water and cool off. Lubbock is sweltering through the hottestJune on record, with 18 days of temperatures over 100.   ``We are concerned for their health,'' said Don Jones, postalfield operations director. ``This is bad weather for them.''</TEXT></DOC>
