Leslie Dach, a spokesman for Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis,said the campaign was spending about $200,000 on Michigantelevision.   Dukakis is using two television ads _ a biography and anotherspot stressing his executive experience in balancing budgets andcreating jobs. Dach said a new and ``wholly positive'' ad aroundthe jobs theme would be introduced today.   Missouri Rep. Richard Gephardt, his campaign floundering afterSuper Tuesday, has much at stake in Michigan. He is running ads inthe state, but his campaign declined to say how much money he isspending.   Gephardt was using a TV biography and his ``Hyundai'' tradespot. The bio features Rep. Claude Pepper, D-Fla., the oldestmember of the House and a champion of elderly causes.   In the trade ad, which helped Gephardt win Iowa last month andshould have appeal in a car-producing state, Gephardt alleges thattariffs boost the price of a Chrysler K-car to $48,000 in SouthKorea. He asks how many $48,000 Hyundais the Koreans could sellhere.   As far as negative ads are concerned, ``there will be no firstuse here in Michigan but certainly a willingness to respond,'' Dachsaid.   By Wednesday, no candidate had triggered anything like the punchand counter-punch ads that characterized the races leading up toSuper Tuesday, March 8.   Jesse Jackson planned a $70,000 television campaign in Michiganstarting today, with half of the money to being spent in Detroit.The centerpiece was a Bill Cosby endorsement which he has usedbefore. Jackson also is spending $20,000 on radio, said spokeswomanPam Smith.   Country singer Johnny Cash was praising Sen. Albert Gore ofTennessee in radio spots around Michigan. Gore is focusing more onthe April 5 Wisconsin primary and spokesman Paul Risley said he wasunlikely to spend money on Michigan television, although ``you canstill buy time. I wouldn't rule it out.''   The fifth Democrat still in the running, Sen. Paul Simon ofIllinois, is also making a stand in Wisconsin and plans no TVadvertising in Michigan. Spokesman Terry Michael said Simon, whowon last week's Illinois primary, is making new ads for Wisconsinand expects to raise enough money in the next 10 days for a$100,000-plus TV campaign there.</TEXT></DOC>
