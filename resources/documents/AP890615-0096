RUBIN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Supreme Court today shielded states fromfederal court lawsuits by parents seeking to enforce a federal lawaimed at assuring adequate education for handicapped children.   The justices voted 5-4 to excuse Pennsylvania officials frompaying a year's private school tuition for a student with a learningdisability.   Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, in his opinion for the court, saidthe broad constitutional immunity from suit enjoyed by states cannotbe eliminated unless Congress makes that intent ``unmistakably clearin the language of the statute. Evidence of congressional intentmust be both unequivocal and textual.''   Kennedy said the possible intent of Congress to limit sovereignimmunity for states cannot be inferred, for example, from statementsmade by sponsors of a bill on the floor of the House or Senate.   In a dissenting opinion, Justice William J. Brennan said thecourt was trying to impose rules on Congress retroactively.   ``It is perfectly clear that again the court ignores Congress'actual intent to abrogate state immunity ... instead resorting to aninterpretative standard that Congress could have anticipated onlywith the aid of a particularly effective crystal ball,'' he said.   He was joined by Justices Thurgood Marshall, Harry A. Blackmunand John Paul Stevens.   Joining Kennedy were Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist andJustices Byron R. White, Sandra Day O'Connor and Antonin Scalia.   Today's ruling applies to lawsuits against states in federal butnot necessarily state courts.   The high court overturned a ruling last year by the 3rd U.S.Circuit Court of Appeals that said Pennsylvania failed to complywith procedures established by the Education for All HandicappedChildren Act.   The 1975 law provides federal aid to states and in return imposesvarious requirements on them.   Pennsylvania was accused of violating procedures aimed atassuring impartiality and prompt decisions when parents challengethe adequacy of education programs for their children.   The 3rd Circuit court ordered Pennsylvania to reimburse RussellMuth of Bucks County, Pa., for tuition he paid to send his son,Alexander, to a private school in Massachusetts for the 1983-84academic year. Muth also was awarded attorneys' fees by the lowercourt.   Alexander, who had been living with his mother in Colombia, was10 years old in 1980 when he came to live with his father inPennsylvania.   The boy was diagnosed as a gifted handicapped child with alanguage learning disability.   Officials of the Central Bucks School District placed himinitially in special classes for speech and language therapy and inregular classes for art, music and other activities.   A dispute arose between Alexander's father and school officialsin 1983 after the boy was ``mainstreamed'' _ placed in regularclasses _ and the experience proved unsuccessful.   School officials then revised the education program forAlexander. But his father was dissatisfied and sent his son to theLandmark School, a private school in Massachusetts, for the 1983-84academic year. Alexander returned to the Central Bucks schools in1986.   Muth sued local and state officials in 1984 in federal court. Afederal judge ruled that the state's procedures for resolvingdisputes over schooling for handicappped children violated the 1975federal law.   The judge ruled that, even though the program proposed in 1983for Alexander by public school officials was acceptable, the stateviolated Muth's procedural rights.   The 3rd Circuit court agreed, ruling that the Pennsylvaniasecretary of edcuation played an improper role in reviewing Muth'scase.   The appeals court said the secretary was not sufficientlyimpartial to act as a hearing officer in the case and also made Muthwait too long for a final decision that could be appealed in court.   The case is Dellmuth vsd. Muth, 87-1855.</TEXT></DOC>
