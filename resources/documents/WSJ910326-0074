Just ask John H. Gutfreund, chairman and chief executiveofficer of Salomon Inc., the big investment bank. Mr.Gutfreund took a 35% pay cut to a salary and bonus of $2.26million in 1990 from $3.5 million in 1989, according toSalomon's proxy statement released yesterday.</LP><TEXT>   Although substantial, Mr. Gutfreund's 1990 salary andbonus were overshadowed by the compensation of several of hissubordinates. These include top traders at Salomon Brothers'shigh-tech bond arbitrage department and Salomon's oil-tradingand refining unit, Phibro Energy Inc.   Such pay disparity on Wall Street isn't new. But the gapat many securities firms appears to be widening as fewerbusinesses thrive amid generally difficult times for thesecurities industry.   &quot;It's not like prize fighting, when you get $6 million forstepping in the ring with Buster Douglas,&quot; says John Keefe,an analyst for Barclays de Zoete Wedd in New York. The highlypaid traders and dealmakers at Salomon and other Wall Streetfirms &quot;are being rewarded for their ability to deliver,&quot; Mr.Keefe says. &quot;They don't get paid without bringing it in.&quot;   Ernst Weil, chairman of Salomon's Phibro Energy unit,received 1990 salary and bonus of $6.6 million, slightly morethan the $6.4 million he took home in 1989, the proxy shows.Andrew J. Hall, Phibro Energy's president and chiefenergy-trading strategist, made even more: about $20 millionin cash and Salomon stock, according to people familiar withthe firm. Because Mr. Hall wasn't made a Salomon Inc.director until February, his compensation wasn't disclosed inthe latest proxy. Mr. Hall's 1989 compensation couldn't bedetermined.   Salomon and its officials declined to comment on thefirm's pay decisions. But people familiar with the firm sayas much as half of top employees' compensation is in the formof Salomon stock that can't be cashed in for five years.   It's not surprising that Messrs. Hall and Weil were richlyrewarded. Phibro Energy had record pretax earnings of $492million in 1990 -- up 31% from 1989 levels. Indeed, Phibro'spretax profit exceeded that of Salomon Inc.'s flagshipSalomon Brothers securities unit, which earned $416 millionbefore taxes last year.   At the same time, the reduced pay of Messrs. Gutfreund andother top officers reflected Salomon Inc.'s 36% drop in netincome. The firm earned $303 million, or $2.08 a share, in1990, compared with $470 million, or $3.26 a share, a yearearlier.   Perhaps the biggest winner at Salomon last year wasLawrence Hilibrand, a hightech trader in the firm's highlysuccessful bond-arbitrage group. Mr. Hilibrand made awhopping $23 million in salary and bonus in 1990, accordingto people familiar with the firm.   Such dizzying payouts can be highly sensitive informationfor Wall Street firms. For instance, after Salomon doled outits 1990 pay -- based on strong bond-trading profit for acompensation year that ended Sept. 30 -- Mr. Hilibrand'sdepartment stumbled. Much of Salomon's fourth-quarter pretaxloss of $90 million stemmed from losses in bond-arbitragetrading.   Phibro's results, meanwhile, so far aren't expected to benearly as good as some quarters in 1990, oil traders andpeople familiar with Phibro say.   All this volatility makes it difficult for many on WallStreet to predict their pay levels from year to year. That'sbecause most traders and bankers on Wall Street depend onbonuses for the bulk of their pay.   ---                       Salomon's Mines                                                                                                          Annual compensation of Salomon Inc. executives, dollaramounts in millions                                                                                                                                            1990           1989 NAME                                PAY*           PAY*                                                                                                        John H.
