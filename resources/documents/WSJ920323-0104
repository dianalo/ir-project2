But somethingelse defeated Paul Tsongas, too: the much-touted publicfinancing laws. The Tsongas campaign is a textbook example ofhow these laws perversely prevent an interesting candidatefrom raising enough money from committed supporters tocompete effectively, thereby eliminating someone like Mr.Tsongas who wants to challenge his party's conventionalwisdom.   In the end, Mr. Tsongas didn't have the $1 million itwould have taken to buy TV time in the pricey New York mediamarket, even though he was raising $93,000 a day. &quot;It's beena political miracle to have been in the game this long,&quot; saysTsongas finance director Nick Rizzo.</LP><TEXT>   When Mr. Tsongas first announced a year ago, he was givenzero chance of ever climbing above single digits in anyprimary. His campaign was $175,000 in debt when it finallycaught on in early January, even after Mr. Tsongas himselfhad chipped in $50,000 of his own money, the maximum allowedby law. The campaign was limited to accepting a maximum of$1,000 from any individual, and despite a brutal fund-raisingpace it couldn't find enough such donors to compete with BillClinton's well-oiled money machine. It's true that PatBuchanan has done well raising money from small donors, buthe began with 70% name recognition from his constant TVappearances.   Former Senator Eugene McCarthy says Mr. Tsongas might havebecome financially viable if he could have accepted largerdonations from individuals attracted to his message. His own1968 campaign, which forced Lyndon Johnson out of office, waskept alive by a &quot;few idealists of means who wrote checks whenthey were most needed.&quot; Mr. McCarthy says an insurgent suchas Mr. Tsongas &quot;can't fairly compete&quot; under a $1,000contribution limit. Since the limit hasn't been indexed forinflation since its adoption in 1975, it's worth theequivalent of $350 today.   Peggy Connolly, Mr. Tsongas's press director, says she haschanged her mind on contribution limits since her days at theHouse and Senate Democratic campaign committees. She stillfavors full disclosure of all contributions, but thinks$1,000 limits are counterproductive. &quot;The only way acandidate can raise big money now is to run around thecountry temporarily convincing everyone you speak with thatyou're on their side,&quot; she told us. &quot;Then you disappoint manyof them after the election.&quot;   Ms. Connally says campaign finance reform has only &quot;meanta delay in the time it takes people to figure out loopholesin the system.&quot; Close loopholes in one place, and they opensomewhere else.   Take Lenora Fulani, the candidate of the bizarre NewAlliance Party. Ms. Fulani has used the party's cultlikefollowers to take advantage of the law that requires thefederal government to match contributions of up to $250. Byearly April, Ms. Fulani will have milked this provision forover $1 million in taxpayer money. Her electoral appeal isnil; running as a Democrat in the New Hampshire primary shewon 402 votes.   The public-financing scheme now in place most benefitsfringe candidates such as Ms. Fulani or David Duke and thosewith a Rolodex full of special-interest contacts. Innovativecandidates are largely denied the seed money they need tocompete. Far from talking about extending public financing tocongressional races, we need to reconsider how the currentlaws reduce competition in presidential campaigns.</TEXT></DOC>
