A duration test of the electrolyte membraneof solid polymer fabricated by bonding Pt and Ir catalyst layers wasmade for seven months to produce hydrogen by the electrolysis of water.The result indicates that the electrolysis will be able to be made athigh current density. The sensitivity to stress corrosion cracking ofstainless steel for electrolysis of water was evaluated. Since a thinfilm of stabilized zirconia fabricated by sintering at a temperatureof 1500{sup 0}C or higher is dense and conductive, it is a promisingsolid electrolyte. Since an inert phase to hydrogen is developed in ahigh-density metallic alloy for hydrogen storage produced by sinteringand partially melting Mg{sub 7}Zn{sub 3}-Ni, it must be improved. A heatingmodule of hydrogenated material monolithically coated on copper tubewas investigated. The application of metallic alloy for hydrogen storageto the hydrogen electrode is studied. A hydrogen-fueled prime mover systemcirculating an inert gas is being developed. Since the low alloy steelpart is extremely embrittled by heating, the intergranular face of coarsecrystal affected by the cycle of welding heat is a problem. (32 figs,4 tabs)</TEXT></DOC>
