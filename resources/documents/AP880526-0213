William Proxmire on Thursday gave his``Golden Fleece Award'' for May to the National Oceanic andAtmospheric Administration ``for wasting $1.9 million on twounneeded helicopters.''   The Wisconsin Democrat said in a prepared statement that NOAA'sOffice of Aircraft Operations circumvented budget processes topurchase the pair of Bell 212's, but now cannot identify a specificprogram to justify them.   ``OAO got the rotors and the taxpayers got the shaft,'' he said.   NOAA's office of public affairs said the agency had no immediatecomment on the award.   Proxmire, who makes the monthly award for ``ridiculous, ironicor wasteful'' spending, said the aircraft office originallyjustified the choppers as a way of improving safety in NOAA'sprogram in the Arctic.   He said that the aircraft operations office, which wasestablished in 1983 to better manage NOAA aircraft use, ``neglectedto mention to Congress that the (Arctic) program's funding wasbeing phased down.''   He quoted an unidentified NOAA manager as saying it was highlyuncertain that the program would even continue after 1988.   ``As a result of these cuts, one of the helicopters logged only40 hours of flying time last year,'' Proxmire said. ``I doubt thatmany of these hours were spent exploring the Arctic continentalshelf, since the helicopter was kept at OAO headquarters in Miamifor the last 20 months.''   Only one new NOAA program, a porpoise survey in the easterntropical Pacific, will need helicopters, but the Bell 212's``aren't suited for this project,'' according to the senator.   ``It would be easy to call this a fly-by-night scheme, but eventhat would overstate these helicopters' actual usefulness,''Proxmire said. ``For a purchase that should never have seen thelight, Northern or otherwise, OAO deserves this month's Fleece.''</TEXT></DOC>
