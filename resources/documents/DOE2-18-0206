Stability analyses were performed on all slopesalong both longitudinal and transverse sections of the longwall panelbefore and after subsidence. Both finite- and infinite-slope analyseswere performed with both drained and undrained cases. The results indicatedthat the changes in the stability of slopes due to subsidence were insignificantfor the cases analyzed. Although significant lateral ground movementswere recorded, these were not attributed to slope failure. Explanationsfor these movements are presented in the paper.</TEXT></DOC>
