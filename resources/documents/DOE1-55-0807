Both agents induceda significant increase in DNA migration, beginning at the lowest doseevaluated. Migration patterns were relatively homogeneous among cellsexposed to X-rays but heterogeneous among cells treated with H{sub 2}O{sub2}. An analysis of repair kinetics following exposure to 200 rads X-rayswas conducted with lymphocytes obtained from three individuals. The bulkof the DNA repair occurred within the first 15 min, while all of therepair was essentially complete by 120 min after exposure. However, somecells demonstrated no repair during this incubation period while othercells demonstrated DNA migration patterns indicative of more damage thanthat induced by the initial irradiation with X-rays. This technique appearsto be sensitive and useful for detecting damage and repair in singlecells.</TEXT></DOC>
