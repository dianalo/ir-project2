(IRD), a NewCanaan, Conn., market research firm that has conducted an extensive study ofthe on-line transaction processing market.andM;Compared to proprietary approaches to OLTP, UNIX falls short for a number ofreasons: Its file system isn't optimized for OLTP; it doesn't include atransaction-processing monitor; it's not designed for concurrentmultiprocessing or fault tolerance; and it's not on data recovery,availability and security.andP;  All of these drawbacks contribute to itsoften-inferior performance in mission-critical OLTP applications.andM;On the other hand, UNIX offers its traditional strengths--applicationsportability across a wide arrawy of systems, an open standard and relativelyine xpensive platforms.andP;  As a result, whether to use UNIX in implementingOLTP poses a tough decision for systems integrators.andM;But they better hurry, because the OLTP market is one of the fastest growingsegments of the commercial data-processing arena, with annual growth rateshovering around 30 percent.andP;  The total U.S.andP;  OLTP market topped $17 billionlast year ($29 billion worldwide), according to IRD.andP;  Of that total, UNIXrepresents about $700 million, or less than 5 percent.andM;Proprietary approaches, most notably those from IBM Corp., currently dominatethe OLTP market.andP;  Software developers and systems integrators who want toleverage the openness and standadization of UNIX have to come up with ways tostrengthen the operating system for OLTP.andM;Fortunately, systems integrators are getting help from hardware and softwarevendors who are beefing up various aspects of UNIX to meet the challenge.andO;Much of this help comes from leading database management system vendorsincluding Informix Software Inc., Oracle Corp., Relational Technology Inc.,andO;Sybase Inc. and Unify Corp.andP;  In addition, standards groups have recognizedthe transaction-processing weaknesses of UNIX and are working on enhancementsthat are still in the early stages of development.andM;Rank file systemandM;One of the biggest drawbacks to UNIX, relative to OLTP, is its file system,which is not optimized for transaction processing.andP;  One problem is that UNIXwrites to a buffer cache, which in turn writes to disk.andP;  However, UNIX writesto the buffer cache only if a buffer is needed and there are no free buffersavailable.andP;  Applications run on the basis of the information in the cache.andO;As a result, something like a power failure could cause data corruption andloss of data integrity.andM;Systems integrators can attack the file-system limitations either by workingwithin the standard UNIX file system or by bypassing it.andP;  For integrators whowant to use the standard UNIX file system, it's fortunate that most DBMSvendors already take advantage of synchronous writes, or write-through cache.andO;This is a feature that has always been present in UNIX, but was notdocummented until System V.3 became available.andM;With synchronous writes, data is flagged and written directly to disk, thusbypassing the UNIX buffer cache.andP;  This slightly degrades performance butguarantees that the application uses information on the disk, not in thebuffer cache.andM;However, most DBMS vendors do not recommend using the standard UNIX filesystem.andP;  The major alternative is to use &quot;raw devices&quot; and the DBMS vendor'sfile-management system, instead of the standard UNIX file system.andM;Raw devices refers to any physical device, usually disk drives.andP;  With thisapproach, the application takes direct control of the device rather thangoing through the standard UNIX file system.andP;  Using raw devices bypasses theperformance and data-integrity drawbacks of the UNIX file system.andM;Systems integrators who implement relatively small UNIX-based OLTPapplications generally go with the standard UNIX file system, because itsperformance and data-integrity drawbacks are not so glaring in those types ofapplications.andP;  However, for large, high-performance, mission-critical OLTPsystems, using raw devices and the DBMS vendor's file system is the preferredapproach.andM;The next release of ATandamp;T Co.'s UNIX--System V.4--solve some of thefile-system dificiencies as they relate to OLTP through modifications to theV.3 file system.andP;  According to Tim Shetler, product marketing manager atInformix: &quot;Modifications to the [V.3] file system may allow us to use theregulat UNIX file system and not go to raw devices, without sacrificing theperformance and integrity you get from raw devices.andP;  That would save theeffort of implementing raw devices.&quot;andP;  However, it's still too early to telljust how much transaction-processing improvement System V.4 will offer.andM;UNIX lacks monitorandM;A bigger-problem with UNIX, at least in high-end OLTP applications, is itslack of a transaction-processing monitor.andP;  &quot;You need a transaction-processingmonitor like the one included with IBM's CICS (Customer Information ControlSystem).andP;  That's a glaring omission in UNIX,&quot; says Stan Tims, director ofUNIX marketing at Oracle.andM;A transaction-processing monitor provides benefits in three key OLTP areas:performance, recovery and availability.andP;  A monitor allocates system resourcesfor OLTP processing and recovery, which increases transaction-processingperformance.andP;  Although off-the-shelf DBMSes provide recovery capabilities,they are not sufficient for many mission-critical OLTP applications.andM;Although the absence of a transaction-processing monitor can be a keydrawback to UNIX in OLTP, there are three possible ways to solve the problem.andO;The most difficult way is for systems integrators or DBMS vendors to writemonitors on their own.andP;  Some DBMS vendors are investigating this option;others are waiting until the demand for it becomes more pressing.andP;  &quot;We don'thave any plans to develop [a monitor] on our own because there's not a bigmarket opportunity for it today,&quot; says Shetler.andP;  &quot;We'd rather invest inthings that will pay off more in the near term.&quot;andM;Similarly, Rich Scheffer, director of marketing at Sybase, says that there isnot much of a demand for a transaction-processing monitor among his company'scustomers.andM;A transaction-processing monitor becomes more desirable in OLTP applicationsas the number of system users increases.andP;  Most existing UNIX-based OLTPsystems service anywhere from a few dozen users to a few hundred users.andO;Transaction-processing monitors become critical only at the high end of thisspectrum.andM;Another option for integrating a transaction-processing monitor is for DBMSvendors or integrators to license a popular transaction-processing monitorsuch as ATandamp;T's /T, which is part of ATandamp;T's Tuxedo OLTP software system.andP;  It'slikely that some DBMS vendors will license /T for their database ports thatrun on ATandamp;T machines.andM;The final option for installing a transaction-processing monitor on UNIX isto go to a third party.andP;  A handful of vendors offer CICS look-alike monitors.andO;However, even though those monitors can be ported to UNIX, they won'tnecessarily work with any given DBMS.andM;Another drawback to using UNIX is that it does not currently offer a highenough level of security for many OLTP applications, particularly those inthe government sector.andP;  The government has established security ratings,ranging from A (high) to D (low).andP;  The goal for most OLTP vendors is a Crating or better, and some database vendors have recently achieved B levelsof security.andP;  (See Systems Integration, Sept., Page 27.)andM;For mission-critical OLTP applications, fault tolerance is often required.andO;In fact, the boom in OLTP is driving a similar surge in fault-tolerantcomputing.andP;  unfortunately, UNIX doesn't have any built-in support for faulttolerance.andM;Tolerating faultsandM;However, systems integrators must first ask themselves how much faulttolerance is really necessary.andP;  Nicolas nierenberg, vice president ofengineering at Unify, explains: &quot;UNIX databases have a lot of recoverycapabilities built in; UNIX machines have high mean time between failures(MTBF); and if you throw in an uninterruptible power supply (UPS), you've gota pretty fault-tolerant system.andP;  Only very critical applications wouldrequire more fault tolerance than that.&quot;andM;For systems integrators that do require UNIX and hardware-redundant faulttolerance, DBMS vendors have ported, or are in the process of porting, theirdatabases to multiprocessor and fault-tolerant machines from companies suchas Integrated Micro Products Inc., Pyramid Technology Corp., Sequent ComputerSystems Inc., Sequoia Systems Inc., Stratus Computer Inc., Tandem ComputersInc. and Tolerant Systems Inc.andM;In addition, to obviate the need for full hardware redundancy, a few DBMSvendors have implemented software-based fault tolerance coupled with mirroreddisks.andM;UNIX vs.andP;  proprietaryandM;As an indication of how important UNIX is to fault-tolerant systems vendors,consider that Stratus has undertaken the formidable job of developing--on itsown--a multiprocessing, fault-tolerant version of UNIX.andP;  The initial releaseof Stratus' UNIX, which will run on the company's XA2000 systems, willprobably not offer the same level of OLTP performance as the company'sproprietary operating system, VOS (Virtual Operating System).andP;  But Stratus'goal is for its UNIX to eventually equal or exceed VOS performance.andO;According to Giovanni Brignolo, group manager for UNIX-product development,Stratus' version of UNIX, which is based on UNIX System V.3, will be ready inthe first quarter of next year.andM;Despite the advances UNIX is making in OLTP, it's still considered inferior,compared to most proprietary approaches.andP;  &quot;UNIX as an OLTP operatingenvironment is still immature, relative to IBM or Tandem [products],&quot; admitsOracle's Tims.andM;Two of the largest growth areas for OLTP are banking and financialapplications, which also represent the lion's share of the installed OLTPbase.andP;  Unfortunately for UNIX vendors, those environments are often too largeand complex for UNIX systems.andM;Consider the situation at First Interstate Bank Corp. in Los Angeles.andO;Although First Interstate is a regional bank, it has more than 325 branchesand more than 6 million customers.andP;  The bank's transaction processing iscentralized in one location.andM;Like most banks in the country, First Interstate relies on IBM mainframes forits central OLTP applications.andP;  The applications software--frequently TPF(Transaction Processing Facility)--runs on mainframe operating systems suchas MVS.andP;  Except as possible frontend machines for IBM hosts, First Interstateis not considering UNIX for its OLTP applications.andM;For one reason, UNIX minicomputers could not handle the batch processing atthe heart of banking transaction-processing operations.andP;  For another reason,the speed required for many OLTP banking applications is beyond the hardwareand software capabilities of UNIX systems.andP;  For example, First Interstate'ssystem for financial-transaction inquiries processes approximately 150,000checks per minute, which is well beyond the capabilities of UNIX machines.andM;Banking on UNIXandM;Similarly, the Continental Bank in Chicago uses IBM mainframes in its centralsystems department.andP;  However, the bank uses UNIX machines for OLTP in itstrading department, where applications involve pulling prices from afinancial exchange to analyze whether a trade is worthwhile or not.andM;The trading department of Continental Bank integrated UNIX-based workstationsfrom Sun Microsystems Inc. and a relational DBMS (RDBMS) from Sybase.andP;  WhyUNIX?andP;  &quot;We needed fast multitasking for single users,&quot; explains Tom Nelson,vice president of technology at Continental Bank, &quot;and UNIX seemed to be themost appropriate way to provide that.&quot;andP;  Nelson reports that theUNIX-Sybase-Sun system easily handles the speed requirements of hisapplication, which runs around 25 transactions per second.andM;Kidder Peabody is another company that integrates UNIX-Sybase-Sun systems forOLTP applications.andP;  In the case of Kidder Peabody, the systems are used forindex-arbitrage applications.andM;According to Jay Wolstenholms, assistant vice president at Kidder Peabody,financial futures, his company didn't even consider non-UNIX solutions: &quot;Wewent with UNIX because we thought Sun was the best way to go and because ofthe availability of people who had expertise in UNIX,&quot; explains Wolstenholms.andM;The only tuning required by Kidder Peabody was to implement raw devices inorder to bypass the UNIX file system.andP;  Wolstenholms reports no performancedrawbacks due to using UNIX in his applications.andM;Because end-users usually buy through intermediaries--systems integrators,application software houses or computer manufacturers--they generally have nosay, or even interest in, what operating system their OLTP system is basedon.andP;  Therefore, the choice of operating system is left up to theintermediaries.andM;And the common goal of all intermediary parties is to protect existinginvestments.andP;  &quot;What systems integrators and VARs want to do is resell thesame code over and over,&quot; says IRD's Bosomworth, &quot;so they have a tremendousincentive to stick with what they first went with.&quot;andP;  That's often proprietarybecause UNIX is a relative newcomer to the OLTP field.andM;Nevertheless, the UNIX steamroller isn't showing any signs of slowing down.andO;As a result, systems integrators will increasingly try to put OLTPapplications on UNIX machines.andP;  What could significantly fuel the trendtoward UNIX would be a major OLTP player accelerating its shift toward UNIX.andO;Unisys Corp. is the most likely candidate.andM;Unisys is the second largest OLTP vendor, behind IBM.andP;  Although most of thecompany's OLTP sales are based on its proprietary systems, Unisys also offersa line of machines--the U Series--that run UNIX and popular DBMSes such asthose from Informix and Oracle.andP;  In addition, Unisys resells UNIX-basedmultiprocessor systems from Sequent.andM;&quot;UNIX development is a significant part of our future,&quot; says Jerry Petersen,vice president of marketing for Unisys' UNIX division, &quot;and the OLTP industryis definitely moving in the UNIX direction.&quot;andP;  Nevertheless, Unisys isunwilling to tip its hand regarding future UNIX-OLTP products or strategies.andO;However, the company is actively involved in the IEEE and X/Open Co. Ltd.andO;OLTP subcommittees.andM;Standards will help OLTPandM;The work of the standards organizations--including the IEEE, X/Open, the OpenSoftware Foundation (OSF) and UNIX International Inc.--may eventually giveUNIX the OLTP boost it needs.andP;  All of those organizations have recognized theneed for transaction-processing support in UNIX.andM;However, those groups are in the early stages of development, and systemsintegrators should not except significant OLTP additions to source versionsof UNIX for another year or so.andP;  The initial release of ATandamp;T's System V.4(which is backed by UNIX International) and the OSF's OSF/1--both of whichare due out before the end of the year--will not significantly boost thetransaction-processing muscle of UNIX.andM;Also fueling the thrust of UNIX into OLTP applications is the boom in opennetworking.andP;  And UNIX systems will see significant growth as front-end OLTPprocessors for host mainframes.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
