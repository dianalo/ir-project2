(FDC)</GV><RE>NORTH AMERICA (NME)NEW YORK (NY)UNITED STATES (US)</RE><LP>   WASHINGTON -- The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. approvedthe sale of Dollar Dry Dock Bank, a failed White Plains,N.Y., savings bank with $3.7 billion in deposits, to EmigrantSavings Bank.   The transaction is the latest example of the FDIC's effortto find new ways to reduce the economic disruption of bankfailures. Emigrant, a New York bank with deposits of $3billion, agreed to take over the failed bank's loan portfolioand to work with troubled borrowers for at least two years,so long as the borrowers continue to make required paymentson their loans.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;Our program is to keep the performing assets from beingliquidated,&quot; FDIC Chairman William Taylor explained recently.The FDIC has been criticized, particularly in New England,for handling bank failures in a way that led to the rapidtermination of credit to borrowers who were making monthlyinterest payments but whose ultimate ability to repay theirloans in full was in doubt because of sharp declines in thevalue of underlying real estate collateral.   Emigrant has three years to return up to $985 million inclassified loans -- those that government examiners believewon't be repaid in full -- to the FDIC for eventualliquidation. But for two years it can't return any classifiedloans on which payments are being made.   Dollar failed because it made too many bad real estateloans. Emigrant is purchasing $3.6 billion of its loans andother assets. Of that amount, $300 million in loans arecurrently in default because payments aren't being made. Anadditional $100 million are classified as likely to go intodefault, although the borrowers are current on theirpayments. The FDIC expects more loans to sour over time.   Emigrant will take over 20 of Dollar's 21 branches. AppleSavings Bank, a New York bank with $3.5 billion in deposits,will take over one branch. Emigrant paid the FDIC a premiumof $32.9 million, and Apple paid $1.5 million.   The FDIC estimates that the failure will cost it a totalof $574 million after it sells off Dollar's sick assets,including a portfolio of foreclosed real estate.   To help Emigrant gather the capital it needs to acquireDollar's deposits, the FDIC purchased 339,000 shares ofEmigrant preferred stock for $33.9 million. The rate on thestock will float at four percentage points over the one-yearTreasury bill rate for the first year and then rise one-halfa percentage point a year. The FDIC has the right to sell thestock at any time.   Whenever possible, the FDIC wants to keep loans under bankmanagement, rather than forcing them into liquidation. Lastmonth, when it couldn't find a purchaser to take over theloan portfolio of CrossLand Savings FSB, a failed New Yorkthrift, it acquired the bank itself and installed newmanagement. The FDIC's goal is to shrink the bank and thensell it. But the $1.2 billion rescue has been widelycriticized in Congress and by bank analysts as a badinvestment in an overcrowded banking market.</TEXT></DOC>
