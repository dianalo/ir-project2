<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-57-0727 </DOCNO><TEXT>Recombinant DNA techniques were used to delete regions of a cDNA cloneof the phosphoprotein NS gene of vesicular stomatitis virus. The completeNS gene and four mutant genes containing internal or terminal deletionswere inserted into a modified pGem4 vector under the transcriptionalcontrol of the page T7 promoter. Run-off transcripts were synthesizedand translated in vitro to provide [{sup 35}S]methionine-labeled completeNS or deletion mutant NS proteins. Immune coprecipitation assays involvingthese proteins were developed to map the regions of the NS protein responsiblefor binding to the structural viral nucleocapsid protein N and the catalyticRNA polymerase protein L. The data indicate the NS protein is a bivalentprotein consisting of two discrete functional domains. Contrary to previoussuggestions, the negatively charged amino-terminal half of NS proteinbinds to L protein, while the carboxyl-terminal half of NS protein bindsto both soluble recombinant nucleocapsid protein N and viral ribonucleocapsidtemplate.</TEXT></DOC>
