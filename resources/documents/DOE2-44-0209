<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-44-0209 </DOCNO><TEXT>A new photoelectrochemical system based on semiconductor photocathodes(p-Si, p-InP) and an electron carrier (mediator) is proposed. Aqueoussolutions of heteropolyacids (HPA): H/sub 7/(PMo/sub 12/O/sub 42/, H/sub8/(SiW/sub 12/O/sub 42/ and H/sub 7/(PW/sub 12/O/sub 42/) and H/sub 8/(SiMo/sub12/O/sub 42/ were examined for use as mediators. The electrons generatedin the semiconductor upon illumination reduce HPA. This reaction proceedsat a lower overvoltage than the direct hydrogen photoevolution from aqueousacid solution. The mediator reduction on the photocathode is followedby a homogeneous dark chemical reaction between the reduced mediatorand water, which results in hydrogen evolution. The catalytic activityof the photocathodes investigated towards electroreduction of HPA increasesafter deposition of platinum traces on the working surface of the electrode.</TEXT></DOC>
