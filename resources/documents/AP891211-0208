MEARS</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   In a political system that is supposed tothrive on competition, there's something odd happening. Politiciansare starting to suggest the only way to deal with really toughissues is under a cease-fire, a truce in which they would agree toput unpopular votes out of campaign bounds.   One Republican leader called it a ``suicide pact,'' and saidthat may be what it takes to get action to rein some politicallysacrosanct spending programs _ Social Security and veteransbenefits were two he mentioned.   The political parties already have put one such deal intoeffect, agreeing that Republicans and Democrats will speak nocampaign evil of each other for supporting the two-step pay raisethe House voted itself just before adjourning.   House leaders of both parties insisted on that pledge before thevote on salaries and a 1991 ban on honoraria, finding at last a wayaround the political perils that have gone with raises incongressional pay for 200 years.   So the chairmen of the national and congressional campaigncommittees agreed the pay vote ``is not an appropriate point ofcriticism in the coming campaigns.'' That will be fine with Housememers who voted for the raise; dissenters and challengers who tryto make it an issue will risk losing the financial and technicalsupport they could otherwise expect from the national campaigncommittees.   With that deal cut, other topics may start to look inviting asprospects for non-aggression pacts.   That idea and some variations on the theme came up last week ata forum on Congress in the 1990s, sponsored by the AmericanEnterprise Institute.   In theory, the American political system and Congress itselfshould work best with ideas, issues, candidates and officeholderscompeting in contests that produce winners, force compromise andultimately shape consensus.   Former President Gerald Ford argued that side of the case at theAEI forum, saying it can work between the branches as well asbetween the parties. ``A little conflict can bring out the best,''said Ford, a former House Republican leader who went to the WhiteHouse and vetoed bills at a record pace, 67 of them in 2{ years.``I'm not sure that confrontation between the White House and theCongress is necessarily bad.''   As for political competition, Ford said if he had the power todraw congressional district lines, each of them would be as closelydivided as possible, with party registration split no more widelythan 60 percent to 40 percent for the minority.   But Rep. Steny Hoyer of Maryland, chairman of the Democraticconference, said congressmen from closely divided districts are themost skittish on controversial votes. He said members withpolitically safe districts may be in better shape to make thecorrect but unpopular decisions that sometimes come to a member ofCongress.   Tony Coelho, the former Democratic whip who quit the Houseearlier this year, said professional, aggressive congressionalcampaign committees in both parties tend to make members nervousabout becoming a target over a potentially unpopular vote.   ``It's very organized, very controlled,'' Coelho said. ``I waspart of it, I recognize it.''   Sen. Alan Simpson of Wyoming, the Senate Republican whip, saidthat's why members of Congress back away from such risky positionsas limiting Social Security benefit increases in order to chip awayat the federal deficit. Republicans tried in 1982 and got creamed,he said.   ``Who the hell is going to do the heavy lifting?'' he said.   All sides acknowledge it will take unpopular votes to make realreductions in the federal deficit.   ``Nobody gets elected saying no,'' said Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill.``You get elected saying yes.''   It was Simpson who suggested that a political truce might be away to get things done, by taking the sting and risk out of votesto cut votes to cut popular spending programs. ``We ought to sitdown and do the suicide pact,'' he said, agreeing members in bothparties will ``go over the cliff together'' and won't try to punisheach other later.   ``It doesn't take courage if we all do it,'' he said.</TEXT><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE><TEXT>   Walter R.
