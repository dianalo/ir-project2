The following paper provides an overviewof the active magnetic bearing technology, including special considerationto the dynamic enhancements of an electronically servo-controlled bearingsystem. Application data from various machinery operating on active magneticbearings is presented. Equipment conditions described exemplify the diversityof the rotor sizes, speeds and operating environments of present industrialapplications.</TEXT></DOC>
