The United States sent the 3,200 troops from the 82nd AirborneDivision and the 7th Light Infantry Division after accusingNicaragua of invading Honduras in pursuit of Contra rebels.   Col. Manuel Suarez Benavides, spokesman for the Honduran armedforces, said the government and the army had given Nicaragua ``aperemptory deadline'' of 24 hours to withdraw 2,000 troops fromHonduras.   In Managua, capital of Nicaragua, President Daniel Ortegadeclared, ``We are ready to combat and liquidate the famous forcesof the 82nd Airborne Division.''   But he refused to confirm or deny if Sandinista troops hadcrossed the border.   ``Here the question is not if (Nicaraguan) army troopspenetrated Honduran territory or not, but that we have dozens ofcamps of mercenary forces in Honduran territory, in view of andtolerated by the Honduran government,'' Ortega said at a newsconference.   He called the U.S. deployment ``another escalation of the waragainst Nicaragua'' and asked for a meeting of the U.N. SecurityCouncil.   The first planeload of U.S. soldiers arrived at Palmerola airbase, the main center of U.S. military operations in Honduras, at10:15 a.m., a U.S. Embassy spokesman said.   Palmerola is about 40 miles northwest of Tegucigalpa, thecapital, and about 125 miles west of where heavy fighting wasreported Wednesday.   Honduran military intelligence sources said about 4,000 Honduransoldiers were still surrounding about 2,000 Nicaraguan troops. Thearmed forces spokesman said the troops were six miles insideHonduras.   ``We will not allow the Sandinistas to move further into theinterior of our territory,'' said one Honduras military source whospoke on condition of anonymity.   ``We want to avoid a large conflict, but if it isn't possible,we will have to face the invading troops.''   The sources told The Associated Press that the Sandinistasoldiers had been in the border province of Olancho, east ofTegucigalpa, for 24 hours when Honduran troops encircled themWednesday.   The sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the entireHonduran military was on alert.   The U.S. Embassy spokesman said 26 C-141 planes carrying the3,200 troops were arriving at Palmerola every 30 minutes in anoperation code-named ``Golden Pheasant'' by the Pentagon. Othercargo planes were carrying equipment.   In Washington, president spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said thecomplete deployment would take about 27 hours. The two battalionswill conduct field exercises with Honduran units.   The Defense Department said the soldiers were carting theirnormal weapons along with nine helicopters and two light tanks.   It was the the most dramatic show of U.S. force in the six-yearNicaraguan war and came in response to a request for help fromHonduras' president, Jose Azcona Hoyo.   Since 1981, Honduras has been a key ally for the United Statesin Central America and for Reagan administration policy aimed atcontaining Nicaragua's government.   Until early 1987, Honduras was the major staging ground forattacks into Nicaragua by the U.S.-backed Contras. The rebels nowsay most of their forces are inside Nicaragua.   The United States maintains about 1,100 soldiers at any one timedistributed among several military installations in Honduras. Inaddition, other national guard and army troops rotate through forjoint exercises and road-building and other projects.   Ortega did confirm that heavy fighting was under way near theborder.   Nicaragua's Defense Ministry denied Sandinista troops enteredHonduras, and Alejandro Bendana, secretary-general of the ForeignMinistry, repeated that denial on NBC-TV's ``Today.''   Bendana said Sandinista troops were on a ``routine militaryoperation'' to push Contras back into Honduras and said it had beensuccessfully completed. Bendana said Sandinista troops had begunwithdrawing from the border region, and he invited the UnitedNations and Organization of American States to visit the area tosee for themselves.   The intelligence sources in Honduras said the Sandinista troopsapparently entered Honduras late Tuesday to destroy a base camp ofthe U.S.-supplied Contras, for whom President Reagan has beentrying to secure continued military funding.   It was not the Soviet-supplied Sandinistas' first reportedincursion into Honduras. In March 1986, 1,500 Nicaraguan troopsreportedly penetrated Honduran territory and U.S. helicoptersferried Honduran troops to the border and provided Honduras $20million in emergency aid.   The Contras have in the past maintained support bases inHonduras, but most moved their camps into Nicaraguan territory lastyear.   In December 1986, Honduran warplanes and artillery poundedSandinista troops who had entered Honduras to attack Contra bases,and U.S. Army helicopters again were brought in to ferry Honduraninfantrymen to the front.</TEXT></DOC>
