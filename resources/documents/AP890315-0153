Some of the 200 Egyptian workers, sightseers and border policemenshouted ``Allahu Akbar,'' or ``God is great!'' as the black, whiteand red flag of Egypt was raised over Taba. Many joined in singingthe Egyptian national anthem, ``My country, my country.''   Israeli hotel workers protested the transfer, setting tires setablaze on a nearby hill. They said they had no assurances aboutemployment under the Egyptians.   The handover came hours after a raid by two Palestinianguerrillas who sneaked across the Egyptian border and hurled a handgrenade at an Israeli army post in the occupied Gaza Strip beforebeing wounded and captured. No Israeli soldiers were hurt.   Also Wednesday, Jewish settlers accompanied by tractors andmobile homes built a new settlement in the occupied West Bank, andone settler leader said the construction was a response in part toIsrael's withdrawal from Taba.   The raid and settlement construction appeared to be attempts byboth Jewish and Palestinian extremists to mar the transfer, whichended seven years of bitter squabblng between Israel and Egypt.   Minutes after Israel handed over the 250-acre strip of beach,Egyptian immigration officials set up tents at the new border markerto handle traffic.   Egyptian workers put finishing touches on a new border gate andimmigration building, which were to be finished by Sunday whenPresident Hosni Mubarak will attend a more festive flag-raisingcelebration.   Mubarak, in Bonn on Wednesday, was asked by Israel radio if hehad a message for Israelis regarding Taba. He said: ``Peace andpeace. It is so important to human beings, so important to theIsraelis and to the Arabs and to human beings all over the world. Itis worth whatever concession. So we should be much more flexiblewith each other so that each country can reach a lasting settlementforever.''   Israel had retained control of Taba when it pulled out of therest of the Sinai in 1982 under the Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty of1979.   An international arbitration panel awarded Taba to Egypt inSeptember, and in February Egypt and Israel signed agreements thatinclude $37 million in compensation for the Israeli owner of Taba'smain hotel, the Sonesta.   An Israeli official said no parallels should be drawn between thereturn of Taba and calls for Israel to withdraw from the West Bankand Gaza Strip, captured in the 1967 Middle East war.   ``Here it is obvious,'' said Yitzhak Lior, deputy directorgeneral of the Israeli Foreign Ministry. ``We had a bone ofcontention with a country with which we have peace. There it isdifferent.''   Ahmed Masery, Egypt's consul general in Eilat, told Israel radiothe transfer should lead to better relations. ``I hope this will bea bridge to peace, peace between the two peoples,'' he said.   On Tuesday night, the Israelis took down their blue and whiteflag and did not raise it again before the handover Wednesday,apparently to avoid a simultaneous lowering and raising of flags.   As Egyptian police and troops carrying rifles entered the resortin groups of three, dozens of Israeli buses, police vehicles andcars drove out of Taba along with about 50 protesting hotel workerswho sang Israel's national anthem, ``Hatikva,'' or ``Hope.''   Israeli workers at Taba's 326-room Sonesta Hotel chanted inprotest shortly before the transfer. Several were arrested.   Elan Ester Hazy, a leader of the hotel union, said: ``We havenothing against the Egyptian government. On the contrary, it istheir right. I'll be ready to work with the Egyptians, but underproper terms.''   Egyptians were jubilant, running up the rocky hills overlookingthe Red Sea and roaming curiously around the hotel grounds. Somebought souvenirs in the hotel shop, which began accepting Egyptiancurrency Wednesday.   ``We came from Nueiba just to watch,'' said Mervat El-Qassar, whodrove 40 miles from her home town with her family.   At the border, a huge sign saying ``Welcome'' in English andArabic hung outside the Egyptian immigration tent.</TEXT></DOC>
