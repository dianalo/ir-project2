A ministry statement released on Monday did not mentioncasualties or say whether Sandinista forces returned fire.   It said Honduran forces attacked the border observation post inMurupuchi in northern Nuevo Segovia province last Saturday using``50mm machine-gun fire, FAL rifles and 10 discharges from M-79grenade launchers.''   There was no immediate response from Honduras.   Acting Foreign Minister Javier Chamorro Mora on Thursday accusedHonduras of six border incursions and three violations ofNicaraguan airspace in September.   The Honduran Foreign Ministry denied the initial reports andcalled upon the Sandinista government ``to improve the situation ofcalm that in reality prevails along the border between bothcountries.''   Also Monday, a political leader of the Nicaraguan rebelscondemned a Nicaraguan government proposal to suspend theactivities of the National Reconciliation Commission until after ameeting of Central American presidents.   Roberto Ferrey, member of the rebel's political directorate,said that the leftist government had ``ordered the suspension'' ofthe commission, set up to verify compliance with a March 23 peaceagreement, ``because they do not run it.''   Roman Catholic Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo heads thecommission, which includes representatives from the government andNicaragua's domestic opposition. It also monitors compliance withthe regional peace agreement signed in August 1987.   On Saturday, Vice President Sergio Ramirez proposed that thecommission suspend further meetings until after a summit meeting ofthe five Central American presidents, tentatively scheduled forNovember.   In a letter to Obando y Bravo, Ramirez said the commission``lacks precise definitions'' and protested an August visit toMiami by two opposition representatives on the commission to meetwith rebel officials.   Ramirez said that visit was made without the approval of thegovernment.   On Sunday, Obando y Bravo said he would ``reflect'' on Ramirez'sproposal but noted that the commission could continue its work``without waiting for the presidents to meet.''   Ferrey told The Associated Press in Miami that the governmentwanted to suspend commission activity in order ``to curtailCardinal Obando's voice as a witness to the regime's constantviolations of the Esquipulas II accords.''   The U.S.-backed rebels and the government halted offensivemilitary operations on March 21 and concluded a temporarycease-fire agreement two days later. But each side accuses theother of frequent violations, and high-level negotiations on apermanent truce to the 7-year-old civil war reached a stalemate onJune 9.</TEXT></DOC>
