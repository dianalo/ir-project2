This time, the Federal Trade Commission got in the act,joining prosecutors from New York and Maryland in chargingthat Nintendo's U.S. arm illegally colluded with somedealers, and bullied others, to set minimum prices for thecompany's home-video consoles.</LP><TEXT>   In an unusual twist, however, the federal and stateprosecutors announced yesterday that they had agreed tosettle the charges in a fashion that could boost Nintendo'salready robust sales.   Under a proposed agreement to settle the state charges,the company would provide up to $25 million in coupons tosome nine million consumers nationwide -- in effect,requiring home-video buffs to purchase more Nintendo productsif they are to benefit from the settlement. Nintendo ofAmerica Inc. controls 80% of the estimated $5 billiondomestic video-game market.   Nintendo would also pay the states $4.75 million indamages and legal costs under the settlement, which requiresthe approval of a federal judge in New York. The proposedsettlement of the parallel but separate federal charges wouldrequire Nintendo to refrain from price fixing but wouldn'tinvolve a monetary penalty. The federal settlement requiresfinal FTC approval after a 60-day period for public comment.   Prosecutors insisted that the state monetary penalties,combined with the company's vow to obey the law in thefuture, would &quot;send a message&quot; to corporate price-fixers inthe U.S. and Japan.   But Nintendo of America said it &quot;did not violate antitrustlaws&quot; and agreed to settle only to avoid &quot;lengthy courtproceedings.&quot; Howard Lincoln, senior vice president ofNintendo of America, asserted: &quot;We decided to enter into thiscomprehensive and nationwide settlement in order to maintainthe good will our company enjoys with millions of consumerswho play Nintendo games.&quot;   The company may not yet have disposed of all of itsantitrust difficulties, though. Lawyers from the FTC and theoffice of New York Attorney General Robert Abrams areinvestigating separate allegations that Nintendo hasattempted to monopolize the home video-game industry by usingproduct designs and licensing policies to lock others out ofits business and keep prices artificially high. Nintendo hasdenied those allegations.   Nintendo has been accused in a series of private lawsuitsof designing its video console so that consumers can use onlyNintendo game cartridges with the machines. In privatelitigation, the company has aggressively tried, oftensuccessfully, to block rivals from selling unauthorizedimitations of Nintendo game cartridges.   At yesterday's joint federal-state announcement here, Mr.Abrams of New York said Nintendo was the fourth Japaneseelectronics giant caught in &quot;conspiracies by manufacturers tostrangle competition and hurt consumers by controlling retailprices.&quot; He estimated that such conspiracies in theelectronics industry and other businesses cost Americanconsumers &quot;hundreds of millions of dollars a year.&quot;   Just last month, a U.S. unit of Mitsubishi Electric Corp.agreed to refund nearly $8 million to consumers to settlecharges that it illegally fixed the retail prices of 242,000television sets. In earlier cases, Minolta Corp. andPanasonic Co. were charged with similar antitrust violations.Minolta agreed in 1987 to pay $7 million to settle chargesthat it tried to manipulate camera prices; Panasonic, a unitof Matsushita Electric Industrial Co., agreed in 1989 torefund $16 million to purchasers of answering machines,stereo parts and other products.   In the Nintendo case, prosecutors said the company's salesrepresentatives enforced prices set by the manufacturer.Retailers who resisted Nintendo's pressure were threatenedwith a slowdown of shipments, a reduction in the number ofconsoles delivered or a complete lockout, prosecutors said.   Nintendo required retailers to sell its NintendoEntertainment System consoles at a uniform price of $99.95from June 1988 through December 1990, according toprosecutors. Some discount retailers resisted Nintendo'sprice policy and helped government investigators; otherdealers eagerly cooperated with Nintendo to increase theirprofit, prosecutors said. But no retailers were named in thecharges because the state and federal governments hadn'tgathered enough evidence to implicate dealers, prosecutorssaid.   State prosecutors agreed to the refund-by-coupon plan,fully understanding that the plan would boost Nintendo'ssales. Mr. Abrams said the coupon arrangement was a responseto the failure of many consumers to apply for cash rebatesavailable to them in the Minolta and Panasonic cases.   &quot;Very, very, very few consumers responded&quot; to the earlierrebate offers, Mr. Abrams said. In fact, consumers sought andreceived less than one-tenth of the money made available byMinolta and Panasonic, according to an Abrams aide.   Under the Nintendo settlement, the company automaticallywould mail $5 coupons to consumers who bought the videoconsoles and filed warranty cards. Other purchasers will bemailed coupons if they call an 800 telephone number andprovide a legitimate console serial number.   The company would redeem a minimum of $5 million and amaximum of $25 million in coupons. If consumers request lessthan $5 million in coupons, the value of the left-overcoupons would be given to the states in cash, bringing thecompany's total minimum liability to $9.75 million.Thirty-four states and the District of Columbia, in additionto New York and Maryland, have signed the Nintendosettlement, and other states may join the agreement duringthe next 75 days.   The FTC's joining in the action against Nintendo reflectsthe commission's increased aggressiveness on antitrustmatters in the past 18 months. Though far more circumspectthan Mr. Abrams, a feisty liberal Democrat, the FTC'santitrust chief, Kevin Arquit, celebrated the first jointfederal-state prosecution of so-called resale-pricemaintenance. &quot;This combined . . . effort is without precedentin the antitrust area,&quot; Mr. Arquit said, &quot;and we look forwardto continuing this partnership in the future.&quot;   Under the federal portion of the settlement, Nintendo hasagreed to refrain from setting prices or pressuringdiscounters. The company has also agreed to send a letter toall of its dealers, informing them of their right to sell thevideo-game consoles at whatever price they choose.   Said Mr. Arquit: &quot;Where retailers are not permitted todiscount, comparison shopping does no good.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
