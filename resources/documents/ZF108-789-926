Box7210, 1901 Landing DR., Mountain View, CA 94039-7210; (415) 962-8910.andM;List PRice: $695andM;REquires: $512K RAM, hard disk, DOS 2.0 or laterandM;In Short: Harvard Project Manager has nicely designed screens with good useof color.andP;  It lets you build project schedule in quite a few different waysand also lets you split the screen to see combined views of your project.andO;However, the program has only limited multiple-program support, some quirksin its translation between WBS and PET charts, is limited to 280 tasks inschedule without using subprojects, and is slow.andM;Harvard Project Manager includes more ways to build a project than any otherprogram at the low end.andP;  You can use the popular outline approach, awork-breakdown chart, Gantt chart, PERT chart, or task list.andP;  You can alsouse a graphic approach unique to this package called Fast Track, whichcombines chart elements for quick and easy project planning.andP;  The $695Version 3.01 from Software Publishing Corp. uses a glitzy design withcolorful, pull-down menus and split-screen views.andM;However, working with this plenitude of graphs, tables, and forms is a bitcumbersome because of some quirks, which can seriously affect your schedules.andO;The package does not support true multiple projects and has a fairly low taskcapacity per project.andP;  It's also slow at switching screens and calculating.andM;Harvard Project Manager's first screen is an attractive main menu withchoices including Create a Project, Edit a Project, Resources, and Reports.andO;The latter two choices let you work without opening a specific project, thussaving time if you want to quickly generate a report for upper management.andM;THE FAST TRACKandM;Create a Project presents you with the blank Fast Track screen, meant todemystify the process through an entry technique akin to word processing.andP;  Bytyping at the cursor position, you can create a task line with the task namewritten in the middle--sequential tasks are on the same line and connected byshort vertical lines, and parallel tasks are on different lines.andP;  In the end,you have a compressed network diagram and a bar chart combined.andM;Fast Track automatically links tasks for you, but you will probably have toadjust the links to match your schedule.andP;  You can do this in Fast Track byusing the Define Link form or by going to the PERT chart.andP;  One of FastTrack's nice features is the ability to adjust task duration by stretching orshrinking the task bar with the plus and minus keys.andP;  This is as close todirect manipulation as you can get without a mouse.andP;  You get to seestructure, time, and many tasks at once, but for anyone familiar with projectmanagement this approach will seem odd.andM;If you use the outline or work-breakdown chart (WBS) in Harvard, you have theadvantage of building a project schedule with phases and summary tasks.andP;  Youcan have a maximum of 99 levels in an outline, but regrettably there are someproblems with the interpretation of an outline or WBS by the rest of theprogram.andP;  Summary levels become milestones on the Gantt and PERT charts, andthey appear as diamonds rather than summary bars on the Gantt and asbeginning and end boxes on the PERT.andM;You can remove the milestones on the Gantt by using the Format menu, but theystay on the PERT, which ends up with bunches of unwanted boxes you have toremove.andP;  Another problem is that you must set all the tasks at one level assequential or parallel when you outline.andP;  Since this may not accuratelyrepresent the flow of your real tasks, you may need to do some rearranging onthe PERT.andM;There's a similar problem if you start to schedule in the Gantt or PERTcharts.andP;  Because of these problems the best way to use the different planningmethods is to set your main project phases in the outline and then go to thePERT to enter detail tasks.andM;Another problem with the outline approach is that time isn't summarizedaccurately.andP;  A top-level task will sum the durations for all the tasks underit, but it won't take into account the links, lags, and leads.andP;  So the totalon the summary task from may be very far from the real total.andM;Since costs aren't influenced by the task dependencies, these totals are moreaccurate.andP;  However, they're always off by a few pennies because of roundingerrors for numbers larger than six digits.andM;VIEWING AND LEVELINGandM;Switching screens is fast when you use the speed key to move between activewindows.andP;  Besides having two (sometimes three) windows active at once, youcan split the screen horizontally in one of the windows.andP;  The split-screenview lets you combine virtually any of the single screens--a PERT chart and aGantt chart, a cost graph and the task form, or the work breakdown outlinewith the resource loading histogram.andM;You can see only one project in a window because RAM holds only one projectat a time.andP;  This has far-reaching effects.andP;  The only way to share resourcesamong projects is to have them in the same directory.andP;  When you do this allthe resources from all the projects are listed in each directory, even if theresources aren't shared.andP;  If you don't want projects to share resources theyhave to be put in a separate directory.andM;Even with projects in the same directory you can't level acrossthem--although you can level one at a time--so you can't optimize thescheduling among the projects, and one or more schedules may get quitestretched out.andP;  The same holds true for subprojects.andP;  In addition, you can'tconsolidate costs for multiple projects or subprojects.andM;DOES HARVARD MAKE THE GRADE?andM;Although Harvard has problems with resource leveling, it does a nice jobmanaging resources, and to a lesser extent, costs.andP;  You can have overtimecosts, maximum overtime hours per day, use a resource calendar, enter aresource code, have an extended description, and record the name of theperson or department responsible for the resource.andP;  You also can do partialresource allocations and enter a resource lag.andM;Harvard Project Manager has some fine scheduling an screen design qualitiesthat you should consider carefully against the backdrop of the speedproblems.andP;  But before purchasing it, you should have a good understanding ofhow this product functions.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
