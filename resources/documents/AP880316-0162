The special federal grand jury that has been investigating thecase nearly 14 months began deliberations after independent counselLawrence E. Walsh made a personal appearance with several of histop assistants.   Charges long have been expected against former national securityadviser John M. Poindexter, his one-time aide Lt. Col. Oliver L.North and two arms dealers, retired Air Force Maj. Gen. Richard V.Secord and his business partner, Albert Hakim.   North, who was fired from his job as a National Security Councilaide in late 1986, meanwhile, went to confer with his defenseattorney, Brendan V. Sullivan Jr.   After making his appearance, Walsh retired to a small office setaside for him in the U.S. Courthouse to be ready in case the grandjurors had questions about the contents of the indictment they werebeing asked to approve.   As he left the grand jury room, Walsh declined to comment exceptto say: ``these things can take a long time'' _ an apparentreference to the panel's discussion of the proposed indictment.   Other prosecutors on Walsh's staff continued to make apresentation but left the grand jury room, apparently to allow thegrand jury to study the proposed indictment. They were summonedbriefly to the grand jury room before the panel took a one-hourlunch break.   For several weeks, Walsh has signaled that he is prepared tobring criminal charges stemming from his investigation into thearms-for-hostages deals with Iran and the diversion of profits fromthe weapons sales to the Nicraguan rebels.   The diversion of nearly $4 million in profits from the armssales occurred at a time when Congress had banned direct U.S.military aid to the Contras.   For the last two weeks, teams of prosecutors from Walsh's officehave been meeting with the grand jury, presumably to makepresentation of the evidence submitted to the panel during itsinvestigation.   Marshaling of the evidence in a grand jury investigation is acommon practice of prosecutors, particularly in a lengthy inquirysuch as the one Walsh has been conducting since the panel wasconvened in late January 1987.   Last week, former national security adviser Robert C. McFarlanepleaded guilty to four misdemeanor charges that he withheldinformation from Congress in 1985 and in 1986 by denying thatmembers of his staff, particularly North, were helping raiseprivate money to arm the Contras during the congressionally imposedban on U.S. military aid.   Walsh also recently hired Herbert Stern, a former federal judge,to contest what he called legal challenges to possible prosecutionsfrom prospective defendants who received congressional immunity fortheir testimony at hearings last summer.   North and Poindexter both testified before the jointHouse-Senate Iran-Contra committee hearings under grants of limitedimmunity from prosecution. The immunity prohibits Walsh from usingany information gleaned from their testimony as evidence againstthem.   Both are expected to claim that Walsh made improper use of theirtestimony in obtaining the indictments. To counter that claim,Walsh has carefully placed evidence he has gathered under courtseal to prove that he obtained it independently of thecongressional hearings.   Last spring, two conservative fund-raisers, Carl R. ``Spitz''Channell and Richard Miller, pleaded guilty to felony charges thatthey conspired with North to illegally use a tax-exempt foundationfor the purpose of raising money for the Contras. Both arecooperating with Walsh's investigation.   The 1985-1986 sales to Iran were part of an effort to trade armsfor U.S. hostages being held in Lebanon by pro-Iranian terroristorganizations.   Congressional investigators determined that of the $16 millionin profits from the arms sales, $3.8 million went to the Contraswhen the congressional ban on direct U.S. military aid to theNicaraguan rebels was in effect.   The administration also raised $34 million in donations to theContras from foreign countries and another $2.7 million fromprivate sources, according to the report of the congressionalinvestigation.</TEXT></DOC>
