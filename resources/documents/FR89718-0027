In issuing the TemporaryRule, the OCC emphasized in the preamble that it would provide relief fornational banks that have experienced a decline in their capital, and hence,in their lending limits, after entering into loan commitments. Nonetheless,the substantive provisions of the Temporary Rule were applicable to <T3>all</T3> national banks.In response to comments received which objected to the impact of the TemporaryRule on banks that have not experienced a capital decline, the OCC is proposingto amend the Temporary Rule. This amendment is intended to revise and clarifythe effect of the rule on the loan commitments of national banks that havenot experienced a decline in capital, by restoring some flexibility tobanks in managing their loan commitments relative to their lending limits.Although the Temporary Rule was effective when it was published, on June24, 1988, this amendment proposes a modified transition period. As partof this transition period, the OCC proposes not to take administrativeaction to enforce the Temporary Rule against banks until the effectivedate of a final rule. However, this amendment does not propose any changeto the effective date of the Temporary Rule or to the retroactive validationof loan commitments made prior to the effective date of the Temporary Rule,that were within a bank's lending limit when made. During this modifiedtransition period, the OCC expects all national banks to become familiarwith the Temporary Rule and its revisions and to amend their lending practicesas necessary.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATE: </T2>Comments must be received by September 18, 1989. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESSES: </T2>Comments should be directed to: Docket No. 89-7, CommunicationsDivision, Fifth Floor, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, 490 L'EnfantPlaza East, SW., Washington, DC 20219; Attn: Jackie England.

Starr, Attorney,Legal Advisory Services Division, and William C. Kerr, National Bank Examiner,Supervision Policy/Research Division.<ITAG tagnum="84">Background</ITAG>National banks are subject to a statutory limitation on the ``total loansand extensions of credit * * * to a person outstanding at one time.'' 12U.S.C. section 84. Section 84 defines ``loans and extensions of credit''as including ``all direct or indirect advances of funds to a person madeon the basis of any obligation of that person to repay the funds or repayablefrom specific property pledged by or on behalf of the person * * *.'' 12U.S.C. section 84(b)(1). In addition, the term ``loans and extensions ofcredit'' includes, ``to the extent specified by the Comptroller of theCurrency,* * * any liability of a national banking association to advancefunds to or on behalf of a person pursuant to a contractual commitment.''<T3>Id.</T3>Exercising the authority of section 84(b)(1), and the more general regulatoryauthority provided at 12 U.S.C. section 84(d)(1), the OCC issued a regulationon national bank lending limits. <T3>See</T3> 12 CFR Part 32 (1988). At Part 32, the OCC generally restatedthe statutory definition of ``loans and extensions of credit,'' and includedwithin that definition a ``contractual commitment to advance funds.'' <T3>See</T3> 12 CFR 32.2(a). A ``contractual commitment to advance funds''was separately defined, and excluded ``undisbursed loan funds and loancommitments not yet drawn upon'' which were not otherwise the equivalentof a contractual commitment to advance funds as defined in the regulation.<T3>Id.</T3> at andSection; 32.2(d). Thus, prior to the Temporary Rule, aloan commitment that was not the equivalent of a ``contractual commitmentto advance funds'' was not considered a loan or extension of credit, suchthat a national bank's lending limit was applicable to it, until fundswere actually disbursed under the commitment. The OCC adopted this definition of a ``contractual commitment to advancefunds'' largely in response to comments which advocated that loan commitmentsand undisbursed loan funds should not be subject to the lending limit untilthe funds were disbursed. <T3>See </T3>52 FR 15844 (April 12, 1983). Nonetheless, the OCC expressedsome concern that banks might not monitor commitments to ensure that theywere properly managed. 52 FR at 15845. For example, the OCC noted thatthere was no legal prohibition against a national bank's entering intoa loan commitment with a borrower which, alone or in combination with otherobligations of that borrower, would exceed the bank's lending limit iffunded. <T3>Id.</T3> Further, the OCC noted that the opportunity to generate feeincome or the desire to retain a large borrower as a customer may createan incentive for a bank to provide a loan commitment in excess of its lendinglimit, where the bank speculated that its future capital levels would increaseor that it would be able to sell any overline to another bank at the timeof funding the commitment. <T3>Id.</T3>Unfortunately, a number of banks experienced problems under the definitionof a ``contractual commitment to advance funds'' established by Part 32.These problems involved not only the question of <T3>which </T3>loan commitments constituted ``contractual commitments toadvance funds,'' and thus ``loans and extensions of credit,'' subject tothe limitations of section 84, but also <T3>when, </T3>a bank's lending limit was applied to such a loan commitment,to determine its legality under section 84. Section 84 does not expressly address when a bank's lending limit is appliedto a loan or extension of credit, to determine its legality. However, theOCC has consistently interpreted an early Supreme Court case as establishingthe principle that the lending limit is applied on the day that the loanis made. <T3>See Corsicana National Bank </T3>v. <T3>Johnson. </T3>51 U.S. 68, 86, (1919). Thereafter, a loan which waswithin the bank's lending limit on the date it was made would not becomea violation of andSection; 84 even if subsequent changes in circumstances,<T3>e.g., </T3>a reduction in the bank's lending limit, caused the loanto become nonconforming. The OCC also applied this principle to a loancommitment; as a result, a bank's lending limit was applied to a loan commitmentonly on the day, and then only to the extent, that funds were disbursedunder the commitment. This treatment of loan commitments resulted in a dilemma for a bank whichentered into a loan commitment within its lending limit when made, butin excess of its lending limit at the time of funding because of an interveningreduction in the bank's capital. If the bank funded the loan in excessof its lending limit, it would violate section 84, perhaps exposing itsdirectors to personal liability. Alternatively, if the bank did not fundthe loan, in compliance with section 84, it could breach a legally bindingloan commitment, thereby risking liability to its customer. The bank'sdilemma was particularly acute when it was not able to sell a simultaneousparticipation to another lender at the time of funding the commitment.The OCC issued the Temporary Rule to provide relief for banks facing thisdilemma, and to enable banks to avoid this dilemma when considering futureloan commitments. <T3>See </T3>53 FR 23752 (June 24, 1988). <ITAG tagnum="84">Provisions of the Temporary Rule </ITAG>In issuing the Temporary Rule, the OCC determined that it was equitableand convenient ``to allow the lending limit to be applied on the date abinding, written commitment within the bank's limit is made, <T3>i.e., </T3>to treat such an `underline' commitment as a lawful `loanand extension of credit' even if the bank's capital declines prior to fundingthat commitment.'' <T3>Id. </T3>Thus, ``if the <T3>total </T3>of the proposed commitment <T3>and </T3>all other loans and commitments to a borrower are within thebank's lending limit at the time the commitment is made, the commitmentis deemed a `loan' and its legality under the lending limit is determinedas of that time.'' <T3>Id. </T3>at 23753. In discussing ``underline'' commitments, the Preambleto the Temporary Rule concluded that ``[o]nce a commitment is treated asa loan, it <T3>must </T3>be included by the bank in computing its lending limit forall subsequent loans to the borrower.'' <T3>Id. </T3>(Emphasis added.) The effect of the Temporary Rule, then,was to allow a bank to fully fund a loan commitment that was within thebank's lending limit when made, even if the bank's lending limit subsequentlydeclined. The Temporary Rule also addressed ``overline'' loan commitments, <T3>i.e., </T3>those loan commitments which would exceed the bank's lendinglimit if funded when made. <T3>Id. </T3>The OCC stated that such commitments would still be permitted,because they would not be treated as ``loans and extensions of credit''until funded. Thus, ``if a bank has made a binding, written loan commitmentto one borrower that, in combination with all other outstanding loans andcommitments to that borrower, is in excess of its lending limit on theday of the commitment, the commitment is not a loan on that date.* * *''<T3>Id. </T3>In that event, ``the lending limit must be calculated andapplied on the date funds are advanced, even if capital subsequently isreduced.'' <T3>Id. </T3>A bank entering into such an ``overline'' loan commitmentwould violate section 84 if it subsequently funded the overline commitmentin an amount which, alone or in combination with all other loans and extensionsof credit outstanding to the borrower at the time of funding, exceededthe bank's lending limit. <T3>Id. </T3>Even in issuing the Temporary Rule, however, the OCC cautioned that ``[w]hena bank is requested to enter into an outstanding binding commitment whichmay exceed its lending limit now or in the future, prudent banking practicewould dictate that the bank take precautions to permit escape from sucha dilemma.'' <T3>Id. </T3>at 23752. As an example, the OCC suggested including ``a protectiveclause in the commitment which would release the bank from its obligationif funding the commitment would result in an overline.'' <T3>Id. </T3>The Temporary Rule achieved its substantive purpose through an amendmentto the definition of a ``contractual commitment to advance funds.'' TheTemporary Rule deleted that portion of the definition of a ``contractualcommitment to advance funds'' which excluded ``undisbursed loan funds andloan commitments not yet drawn upon'' which were not otherwise the equivalentof a contractual commitment to advance funds. In its place, the TemporaryRule added in part: ``A binding, written commitment to lend is a `contractualcommitment to advance funds' under this part if it and all other outstandingloans (including other binding commitments) to the borrower are withinthe bank's lending limit on the date of the commitment.'' <T3>Id. </T3>at 23753-54.In order to provide the swiftest relief, the Temporary Rule was made effectiveon publication, <T3>i.e.,</T3> on June 24, 1988. <T3>Id.</T3> at 23752. In addition, the Temporary Rule was made retroactive,to permit ``a bank to honor all legally binding commitments which weremade in good faith prior to the effective date of the amendment and werewithin the bank's lending limit when made, even if the <T3>advances</T3> would cause the bank to exceed its present lending limitif they were treated as loans.'' <T3>Id.</T3> at 23753. The Preamble specifically stated, however, thatthe Temporary Rule would not ``retroactively validate <T3>advances</T3> that were made prior to the effective date of the newrule and that exceeded the lending limit at that time.'' <T3>Id.</T3> <ITAG tagnum="84">Summary of Comments Received on the Temporary Rule; Agency Action</ITAG>Although the Temporary Rule was made effective on publication, the OCCrequested comment on it, providing a 90-day comment period which endedon September 22, 1988. <T3>Id.</T3> at 23752. During the comment period, the OCC received only13 comment letters from national banks and one trade association. Of theseletters, only one opposed the intent of the Temporary Rule contending thatit encouraged the perpetuation of poor management practices. This commentersuggested that banks make use of protective clauses in loan commitments.As an alternative, if the OCC chose to issue the Temporary Rule as a finalrule, this commenter argued that all loan commitments should be treatedconsistently, <T3>i.e.,</T3> that an ``overline'' commitment should be treated as anillegal loan on the day it was entered into, rather than on the day itwas funded. The remaining 12 comment letters supported the intent of the TemporaryRule and expressed appreciation to the OCC for responding to the dilemmaimposed upon banks which had experienced, or might experience, an unexpecteddecline in capital. Some commenters offered minor suggestions for amendingthe Temporary Rule. Most notable however, were four comments that addressedthe effect of the Temporary Rule on banks which had not experienced a declinein capital; each of these comments objected to a perceived negative impactof the Temporary Rule on ``healthy'' banks. These comments are discussedbelow. Three commenters suggested that the Temporary Rule be expanded, to applyto binding oral commitments in addition to binding written loan commitments.The OCC has considered this suggestion, but has chosen to retain the presentscope of the Temporary Rule, which applies to binding <T3>written</T3> loan commitments only. Although the OCC recognizes thatin some states, some oral commitments to lend may in fact be binding, thebinding nature of these commitments is often determined only through litigation.With the Temporary Rule, the OCC has for the first time offered a banka method of protecting itself and its outstanding loan commitments froma subsequent decline in the bank's capital. As a matter of prudent bankingpractice and for ease of monitoring compliance with section 84's lendinglimit, the OCC is requiring banks which would take advantage of the protectionprovided by the Temporary Rule to enter into binding written commitmentsto lend, rather than oral commitments, even where that oral loan commitmentmay be supported by bank documentation. One commenter requested that any final rule be clarified to permit renewalsof loan commitments, including unfunded commitments, that were within thebank's legal lending limit when made, even though the commitment may begreater than the lending limit at the time of its renewal. In responseto this comment, the OCC has considered the effect of the Temporary Ruleon renewals of loan commitments generally, whether funded or unfunded.The OCC has previously recognized that the renewal of an existing outstandingloan is not an advance of funds for the purposes of section 84. Thus, theOCC has allowed a bank to renew an outstanding loan, even where the bank'slending limit has declined such that a new loan, if made as of the dateof the renewal, would have resulted in a violation of the bank's lendinglimit. The renewal of a loan which is in excess of the bank's presentlyapplicable lending limit, but which was legal when made, does not constitutea violation of section 84; rather, the loan is considered ``nonconforming.''As an integral part of the renewal of a loan in excess of the bank's presentlyapplicable lending limit, however, the OCC has consistently required thatthe bank make every effort to bring the loan into conformance with itslending limit through the sale of participations or other loan restructuringprior to renewing the loan. In that the Temporary Rule deems a loan commitment which is within a bank'slending limit when made to be a loan, a question was raised about the treatmentof a renewal of an unfunded or partially funded loan commitment which waswithin the bank's lending limit when made but which would exceed the bank'slending limit if entered into on the date of renewal. An argument may bemade that an underline loan commitment should be treated as a loan in allrespects, allowing for a renewal of the commitment even after the bank'scapital has declined. However, the OCC views the expiration of an unfundedor partially funded loan commitment, or any restructuring of the commitment,as an opportunity for a bank to bring that loan commitment into conformancewith the bank's then-applicable lending limit.Thus, where a bank has entered into and funded or partially funded a loancommitment which was within the bank's lending limit when made, and thebank's lending limit subsequently declines, the bank may renew that portionof the loan commitment which has been funded, as though the loan commitmentwere a term loan. Alternatively, the bank may enter into a new loan commitment,which, with all other outstanding obligations of the borrower, is withinits new lower lending limit. As a loan commitment within the bank's lendinglimit when made, this commitment would be construed as a loan, which subsequentlymay be fully funded, even if the bank's capital and lending limit shouldagain decline. The OCC has determined that an unfunded loan commitment,or the unfunded portion of any loan commitment, which would exceed thebank's lending limit if made on the date of renewal, may not be renewed.If a bank renews an unfunded loan commitment, which renewal is in excessof its legal lending limit when made, the renewal will be construed asan overline commitment, not subject to the protections of the TemporaryRule. Such a renewal does not of itself constitute a violation of Section84, however; the bank will violate Section 84 only when funds providedpursuant to an overline commitment exceed the bank's lending limit. Ifthe bank renews the funded portion of a partially funded loan commitmentwhich was within the bank's lending limit when made, but which now exceedsthe bank's lending limit, the loan will be considered ``nonconforming''to the extent that funds disbursed prior to the date of the renewal exceedthe bank's lending limit as of the date of the renewal. If the bank advancesadditional funds, however, the bank will exceed its lending limit, andhence, violate Section 84. Another commenter, while agreeing with the intent of the Temporary Rule,suggested that the OCC take action less formalIy, either through an interpretiveruling or through an internal advisory letter to national bank examiners.However, as the Temporary Rule amended the OCC's definition of a ``contractualcommitment to advance funds'' stated at 12 CFR andSection; 32.2(d), the OCChas determined that a regulation is the appropriate mechanism by whichto implement the intention of the Temporary Rule. Further, issuing theTemporary Rule as a regulation is consistent with the OCC's continuingeffort to consolidate its existing regulations and interpretive rulingson national bank lending limits into one comprehensive regulation. As noted above, four comments addressed the effect of the Temporary Ruleon a bank which had not experienced a decline in capital. Three of thesecomments, each from a national bank, specifically objected to the TemporaryRule, generally protesting that it restricted the flexibility of banksin managing their loan commitments relative to their lending limits. Onenational bank commenter stated that the Temporary Rule imposed ``new andburdensome constraints on the ability of all national banks to manage theirrelationships with substantial borrowers.'' It is in response to thesecomments that the OCC is proposing a revision of the Temporary Rule. Each of the three comment letters which specifically objected to the effectof the Temporary Rule on the lending practices of banks which had not experienceda decline in capital did so for the same reason, which may be describedwith an example. Thus, assume that a national bank has a lending limitof $10,000,000.00. The bank has one loan, in the amount of $5,000,000.00,outstanding to Borrower. At Borrower's request, the bank enters into alegally binding written commitment with Borrower for an additional $5,000,000.00,to be funded at a later date. After entering into the loan commitment,but before it is funded, Borrower requests a short term loan, of $10,000.00,from the bank. Prior to the Temporary Rule, the bank would have been allowedto extend the short term credit requested without exceeding its lendinglimit. Under the Temporary Rule, however, the $5,000,000.00 loan commitmentmust be counted as a loan when made, because as of that date it was withinthe bank's lending limit. By entering into the commitment, the bank hasreached its lending limit, and may not extend the additional short termcredit Borrower requested without violating Section 84. The example above demonstrates that, as a result of the Temporary Rule,healthy banks may not make some extensions of credit which they could havemade prior to the Temporary Rule. Thus, the Temporary Rule has been seenas placing an additional and unnecessary burden on healthy banks. In responseto these objections, the OCC is proposing to amend the Temporary Rule.The proposed amendment is intended to allow a bank which has entered intoa loan commitment with a borrower, which was within the bank's lendinglimit when made, to extend additional credit to that borrower, which whenaggregated with all other funds <T3>actually disbursed </T3>to the borrower, does not exceed the bank'slending limit. In proposing this revision, the OCC has recognized thatmost banks do carefully and effectively monitor funds actually disbursedto a borrower, thereby avoiding a violation of Section 84, even thoughthe nominal amount of credit available to that borrower, through loansor loan commitments, exceeds the bank's lending limit.<ITAG tagnum="84">Summary of the Proposed Revision of the Temporary Rule, With Examples</ITAG>Three of the commenters objecting to the impact of the Temporary Rule onbanks which had not experienced a decline in capital proposed an alternativeto the Temporary Rule's treatment of loan commitments. These commenterssuggested that a bank not be <T3>required </T3>to consider a loan commitment which was within the bank'slending limit when made as a loan, which, when combined with all otheroutstanding obligations of the borrower <T3>must </T3>be within the bank's lending limit. Rather, these commentersproposed that the bank be allowed to make an election, choosing whethera loan commitment which is within the bank's lending limit when made shouldbe treated as a loan as of the day it is entered into or as of the dayit is funded. Although the OCC considered that alternative, the OCC has rejected it infavor of this proposed revision. In rejecting the suggestion offered bythe commenters, the OCC considered that a bank may not be in the best position,at the time of entering into an underline loan commitment, to determinewhether that commitment should be treated as a loan or as an overline commitment.Such a decision may better be made after the loan commitment has been enteredinto, if and when the bank is called upon to make an additional extensionof credit which, when aggregated with the total amount to be advanced underthe loan commitment, would cause the bank to exceed its lending limit tothe borrower. At that point, the bank may more accurately assess its potentialincreases or decreases in capital, to determine the prudence of extendingthe later-requested credit. To achieve the flexibility desired, the OCC is proposing a method by which``underline'' loan commitments, <T3>i.e., </T3>those loan commitments which, with all other outstandingobligations of the borrower, are within the bank's lending limit when made,will qualify for the protection provided by the Temporary Rule. An ``overline''loan commitment, <T3>i.e., </T3>a loan commitment which, with all other outstanding obligationsof the borrower, exceeds the bank's lending limit on the date it is enteredinto, will not qualify for the protection of the Temporary Rule. However,some underline commitments, which qualified for the protection of the TemporaryRule when made, may subsequently be disqualified. An underline commitment will be disqualified from the protection of theTemporary Rule if, after entering into the underline commitment, the bankmakes an additional loan or an extension of credit to the borrower, whichexceeds the bank's lending limit when combined with the nominal amountof any underline loan commitments and all other loans outstanding to theborrower. Note that, as an overline commitment is not considered a loanor an extension of credit until it is funded, merely entering into an overlinecommitment subsequent to a qualifying underline commitment to lend willnot, of itself, disqualify an earlier qualifying commitment to lend. Advancesof funds under an overline commitment may result in the disqualificationof an underline commitment to lend, however. Once an underline commitment has been disqualified, it will be treatedas if it had been an overline commitment. Thus, a disqualified loan commitmentmay be funded only to the extent that any advance under the commitment,combined with all other obligations outstanding to the borrower, does notexceed the bank's lending limit on the date of funding. Disqualificationof a loan commitment may also result in a violation of Section 84, wherethe funds disbursed under the loan commitment, when combined with all otheroutstanding obligations of the borrower and the amount of the disqualifyingcredit, exceed the bank's lending limit on the date of the disqualifyingcredit. Although a bank does not violate Section 84 when it fully funds a qualifiedunderline loan commitment in excess of the bank's lending limit on thedate of funding, funding the loan commitment may nonetheless result intotal obligations outstanding to a borrower in excess of the bank's lendinglimit. This excess credit is ``nonconforming'' for the purposes of Section84, and must be taken into account prior to any subsequent loans whichthe bank would make to the borrower. In other words, to the extent thata bank has nonconforming loans outstanding to a borrower, the bank maynot make additional extensions of credit to that borrower. The requirementthat a bank consider its nonconforming loans prior to extending any additionalcredit to a borrower is not new with this proposed revision of the TemporaryRule, nor was it imposed by the Temporary Rule. The examples below illustrate (1) the disqualification of an underlinecommitment, and (2) a nonconforming, but not illegal, loan commitment.<T3>Example I: </T3>This example illustrates the disqualification of anunderline loan commitment. Assume that a national bank has a lending limitof $10,000,000.00. On June 1, 1988, the bank has one loan, in the amountof $5,000,000.00, outstanding to Borrower. On July 1, 1988, at Borrower'srequest, the bank enters into a legally binding written loan commitmentwith Borrower for an additional $5,000,000.00, to be funded at a laterdate. As this loan commitment, when combined with all other outstandingobligations of Borrower to the bank, is within the bank's lending limitwhen it is made, it qualifies for the protection of the Temporary Rule.Unless it is disqualified, this loan commitment may be fully funded, notwithstandinga subsequent decline in the bank's lending limit.On August 1, 1988, after entering into the loan commitment, but beforeit is funded, Borrower requests an additional loan of $1,000,000.00 fromthe bank; this loan is not related to the qualifying loan commitment. Oncethe bank makes this loan, the total outstanding obligations of the Borrower,including the amount of the unfunded loan commitment, exceed the bank'slending limit. Under the Temporary Rule, as published and made effectiveJune 24, 1988, the bank would have violated section 84 on making this $1,000,000.00loan to Borrower. Under the proposed revision of the Temporary Rule, however,the bank would not violate section 84. Rather, in making the $1,000,000.00loan, the bank has effectively elected to disqualify its July 1, 1988,loan commitment. As a disqualified underline commitment, the loan commitmentmay subsequently be funded only to the extent of the bank's lending limiton the date of funding. Thus, if Borrower later seeks to have the loancommitment funded, the bank may provide only $4,000,000.00 without violatingsection 84. Of course, the bank may attempt to sell participations forthe remaining $1,000,000.00 of the loan commitment. Note that if Borrower had requested a second loan commitment of $1,000,000.00on August l, 1988, rather than a loan, the July 1, 1988, loan commitmentwould not have been disqualified. The proposed revision provides that aqualifying loan commitment may only be disqualified by a subsequent loanor extension of credit which would cause the bank to exceed its lendinglimit when combined with any underline commitments to lend and all otheroutstanding obligations of the borrower. A loan commitment of $1,000,000.00,entered into on August 1, 1988, would have been an overline commitment.Since an overline commitment is not considered a loan or an extension ofcredit until it is funded, the overline commitment could not have triggeredthe disqualification of the July 1, 1988, loan commitment. <T3>Example II: </T3>This example illustrates the consideration that mustbe given to a nonconforming loan, in excess of the bank's lending limitas a result of the bank having fully funded a qualifying loan commitment,after the bank has experienced a decline in its capital, and hence, itslending limit. Assume that a national bank has a lending limit of $10,000,000.00.On June 1, 1988, the bank has one loan, in the amount of $5,000,000.00,outstanding to Borrower. On July 1, 1988, at Borrower's request, the bankenters into a legally binding written loan commitment with Borrower foran additional $5,000,000.00, to be funded at a later date. As this loancommitment, when combined with all other outstanding obligations of Borrowerto the bank, is within the bank's lending limit when it is made, it qualifiesfor the protection of the Temporary Rule. Unless it is disqualified, thisloan commitment may be fully funded, notwithstanding a subsequent declinein the bank's lending limit. On October 1, 1988, Borrower requests that the bank fully fund its July1, 1988, loan commitment. By this time, the bank's lending limit has declinedto $7,000,000.00. As the loan commitment was within the bank's lendinglimit when made, and has not subsequently been disqualified from the protectionof the Temporary Rule, the bank may fully fund this loan commitment withoutviolating section 84. However, when the bank fully funds that commitment,it will have total extensions of credit outstanding to Borrower of $10,000,000.00,exceeding its lending limit by $3,000,000.00. On November 1, 1988, Borrower requests a short term loan of $500,000.00from the bank. As the bank has exceeded its lending limit to Borrower,and has nonconforming extensions of credit outstanding to Borrower, thebank may not make this loan without violating section 84. On learning of the bank's inability to extend this credit to Borrower,Borrower notes that on November 15, 1988, it will repay the first of five$1,000,000.00 installments of principal on its $5,000,000.00 loan. Borrowerfurther notes that its present outstanding obligations, at $10,000,000.00,do not result in a violation of section 84. Thus, Borrower asks whether,on receiving that $1,000,000.00 payment, the bank may then make the requested$500,000.00 available to Borrower, for total outstanding credit to Borrowerof $9,500,000.00. Notwithstanding a reduction in Borrower's outstanding obligations, to anamount less than the $10,000,000.00 which the bank has extended to Borrowerwithout violating section 84, the bank may not make the requested $500,000.00available to Borrower. Even though Borrower will reduce its total outstandingobligations to the bank, the reduction will not bring the total withinor below the bank's lending limit on that day. Thus, the bank's total obligationsoutstanding to Borrower are still nonconforming for the purposes of section84 and the bank may not make additional extensions of credit to Borrowerat this time.<ITAG tagnum="84">Proposed Revisions to the Temporary Rule </ITAG>In order to achieve the results intended by this revision, the proposalwould amend the definition of a ``contractual commitment to advance funds,''at 12 CFR 32.2(d), to include a ``qualifying commitment to lend.'' Therevision would also add a definition of a ``qualifying commitment to lend''to the definitions provided by Part 32. The definition of a ``qualifyingcommitment to lend'' notes that all written legally binding loan commitments,which, when combined with all other outstanding obligations of the borrower,are within the bank's lending limit when made, are qualifying commitmentsto lend. The definition then describes the disqualification of an underlineloan commitment. The specific language of the proposed definitional amendmentsto andSection; 32.2 is fully set forth below. In addition to the substantive revision of the Temporary Rule, the OCCis proposing a modified transition period, during which the OCC will nottake administrative action to enforce the Temporary Rule against nationalbanks. The provision for a transition period will not change the effectivedate of the Temporary Rule, or its validation, for the purposes of theTemporary Rule, of all legally binding commitments which were made in goodfaith prior to the effective date of the Temporary Rule, and which werewithin the bank's lending limit when made. The OCC proposes that the transition period extend from the date the TemporaryRule became effective, on June 24, 1988, until 60 days after the date theTemporary Rule is made a final rule. This transition period recognizesthat many banks may not have fully understood the requirements of the TemporaryRule, and its applicability to all national banks. The OCC intends thatnational banks use the transition period to become familiar with the provisionsof the Temporary Rule, and any revisions of the Temporary Rule, and amendtheir lending practices as necessary. As the transition rule incorporatesa policy of limited administrative forbearance, it is addressed in a new,separate section of Part 32, at andSection; 32.9. The proposed language ofthis rule is also set forth below. <ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Flexibility Act Analysis </ITAG>Pursuant to section 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C.601 <T3>et seq., </T3>it is certified that this notice of proposed rulemaking,if adopted as a final rule, will not have a significant economic impacton a substantial number of small banks. <ITAG tagnum="84">Executive Order 12291 </ITAG>The OCC has determined that this proposed rule is not classified as a ``majorrule,'' and therefore does not require a regulatory impact analysis. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 12 CFR Part 32 </ITAG>National banks, Lending limit, Loan commitments. <ITAG tagnum="84">Authority and Issuance </ITAG>For the reasons set forth in the preamble, Title 12, Chapter I, Part 32of the Code of Federal Regulations is proposed to be amended as set forthbelow: <ITAG tagnum="52">PART 32_LENDING LIMIT </ITAG>1.
