Reeves got a big laugh outof that.;    &quot;Your body gets old, and you don't want it to get old,&quot; he saidwith a smirk.;    That's all there is to it to some of these NFL blockheads. Aplayer loses a step, he's written off. Business is business, no matter howmany times somebody exhorted that player to channel a spiritual fervor intoevery snap of the ball. And the player who won't accept that his age negateshis dedication is derided.;    &quot;Your body gets old, and you don't want it toget old.&quot; Chuckle, grin.;    Bill Walsh wasn't like that. The former 49erscoach, honored at a dinner Saturday night as an outstanding alumnus of SanJose State, always was able to make hard decisions about telling a player histime in the NFL had run out. But he never discounted the human factor.;   &quot;Pride and ego are a major factor in sports,&quot; Walsh commented last week. &quot;Thesacrifices take it out of the realm of pure business. A player is not anobject. He's not a number.&quot;;    There are former players who believe Walsh isno different than Reeves, except that he has a better spiel. There's a longlist of ex-49ers who weren't happy with the way they went out. If Dwight Clarkisn't as illustrious a name as Ronnie Lott, it's close.;    But that justproves Walsh's approach wasn't necessarily appreciated, not that he didn'ttry. There are many examples, all different because Walsh didn't lose sight ofpeople's individuality.;    &quot;With Freddie Solomon,&quot; Walsh recalled, &quot;it was amatter over a long period of helping him condition himself to the idea that itwould be his last year. Of reminding him that the muscle pulls that kept himout of games would be a reason for him to retire.&quot;;    Sure, that sounds a bitpatronizing, but all you have to do is look at the recent Lott and Roger Craigfiascoes to weigh the relative merits of the 49ers' approach with and withoutWalsh. Re-read the quote about Solomon. Now ask yourself if Walsh would havegiven Lott a three-year contract extension in November but then have demandedin February that he retire after only one more season.;    Why were the 49ersso convinced, despite evidence to the contrary, that Lott and Craig wouldreturn to them instead of signing with the Los Angeles Raiders, as they did?Basically, it was because they looked at it as Reeves would have.;    From abusiness standpoint, the offers they made Lott and Craig were certainlycompetitive with the ones from the Raiders. They were counting on Lott andCraig to carefully reason their way to the same conclusion. In other words,they discounted the pride factor. The human factor.;    Walsh wouldn't havedone that. He might have decided, just as the current management did, thatLott and Craig were near the end of the line. But he wouldn't have made themistake of treating them as worn-out machinery.;    Of all the reasons tohonor Bill Walsh, I like that one the best.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Mike Antonussi column  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910414  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Sunday  </DAY><MONTH>  April  </MONTH><PG.COL>  3D  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  596  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Sunday April 14, 199100105223,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
