It is the carboxylateson the surface which dominate the surface chemistry of the lignite-watersystem. The surface chemistry of various lignite samples from South Australiaand Victoria was investigated by two techniques: microelectrophoresisand potentiometric titration. The mobility vs. pH characteristics forthe South Australian lignites were very similar, however, some differenceswere observed for the Victorian lignites. Mobility characteristics forthe Yallourn lithotypes showed iep values of 3 for the medium-dark anddark, and 2 for the medium-light and light lithotypes. Samples of Yallournbriquettes and char showed iep values of 2.0 and 2.5 respectively. Potentiometrictitrations failed to define the zpc of the South Australian lignites,although Morwell (Victoria) lignite showed a zpc of 4. The surface characteristicsof the Yallourn lithotypes were very similar and spanned the characteristicsof the ROM sample. Titrations conducted on the processed Yallourn samplesshowed that the char had a strong positive charge from pH 3-9, whereasa negative zeta potential was measured for pHandgt;2. This shows that thetwo techniques must investigate surface behaviour at different positionsin the lignite-electrolyte system. 12 refs., 8 figs., 3 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
