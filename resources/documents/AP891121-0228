As a federal bankruptcy judge poised to convert the Chapter 11bankruptcies of one of William Herbert Hunt to a Chapter 7liquidation, spokesmen for two creditors, Minpeco S.A. andManufacturers Hanover Trust Co. of New York, announced Monday theyagreed on settlement terms.   Terms were not disclosed, however.   U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Harold Abramson emerged from hours ofclosed-door meetings to announce he would defer until Dec. 15signing the order. If the agreement breaks down, Abramson couldproceed with liquidation.   Abramson notified all parties two weeks ago that without anagreement by Nov. 20 he would convert the case to a Chapter 7.   Under Chapter 11 of federal bankruptcy laws, a debtor is allowedto continue to operate with protection from creditors' claims whilea debt repayment schedule is arranged. Under Chapter 7, assets aresold to repay creditors.   According to bankruptcy court filings, Herbert lists $169million in assets and Bunker lists assets of $250 million.   ``We couldn't be happier,'' said Stephen McCartin, head attorneyfor Herbert Hunt, who had asked for a delay in Abramson'sconversion order.   The compromise between Manufacturers Hanover Trust and Minpeco,a mining company owned by the Peruvian government, refocuses bothcases toward a more orderly reorganization away from chapterliquidation feared by creditors.   Major creditors said they would have received nothing under afire-sale Chapter 7 liquidation, and most of the money from the twobrothers' estates would have gone to the Internal Revenue Service,which claims 80 percent of Herbert Hunt's assets and 70 percent ofBunker Hunt's.   Four of the largest creditors in the case _ ManufacturersHanover, Minpeco, the IRS and the trustee for Hunt InternationalResources Co. _ said they and the debtors would file joint plans ofreorganization today in Abramson's court.   Minpeco has been trying to collect a $132 million judgmentagainst the brothers stemming from the 1979-80 silver marketcollapse. With attorneys' fees and interest, the judgment hasswelled to more than $250 million.   Other creditors _ led by Manufacturers Hanover, which is owed$36 million _ argued that Minpeco already has recovered its silverlosses from other third-party defendants and that the money wouldbe better spent paying other creditors.</TEXT></DOC>
