Shipping executives said the 36,904-ton Sagheera may have hit adrifting mine.   London-based LLoyd's said the vessel, identified as a bunkeringoil tanker manned by Greek officers and Sri Lankan seamen, carried34 crew.   The Omani navy rescued 26 crew members in lifeboats, the shippingexecutives said on condition of anonymity.   They said winds gusting to just under 35 mph lashed waves as highas 30 feet in the southern Persian Gulf and the Strait of Hormuz,the gateway into the gulf.   Despite the storm, two salvage tugboats reached the blazingtanker and were trying to keep it afloat, the executives said. Atnightfall it was listing heavily and still burning, they reported.   Last April 4, when the Iran-Iraq war was still raging, Iraniangunboats attacked the Sagheera, setting it afire near the Strait ofHormuz. The fire was put out and no one was hurt.   Lloyd's, which monitors shipping traffic around the world, saidon Thursday that the vessel was reported to be abandoned and nofurther details were available.   An explosion tore through the tanker's pump room before the shipcaught fire, Lloyd's reported, but it did not say what might havecaused the blast.   Executives theorized that a mine from the Iran-Iraq war may havebeen whipped loose from its mooring by fierce winds.   ``It could be the work of a mine, but it could also be aninternal explosion, one of the oil tanks catching fire andexploding,'' one said.   Scores of mines are believed spread about the gulf and theArabian Sea more than four months after a cease-fire took effect inthe gulf war.   The empty tanker was steaming from Fujairah on the Arabian Sea tothe loading port in Saudi Arabia, Mina Saud, Lloyds said.   It said the Sagheera caught fire just outside Omani territorialwaters before the bend of the V-shaped Hormuz Strait.   Lloyd's said a big oil slick formed.   The shipping executives ruled out the possibility of an attack byan Iranian speedboat, saying the weather was too bad for suchvessels to operate. approaching the Sagheera to quench the fire.   Lloyd's said the Sagheera is owned by the Dammam-based GeneralContracting Importing and Service Enterprises (General BunkeringServices, Dammam) and managed by the Avin International BunkersSupply SA, based in Piraeus, Greece.   Early Thursday, bad weather caused the 9,724-ton, Honduran-flagfreighter Moajil-5 to run aground after it broke anchor in roughseas, according to gulf and London shipping sources, who spoke oncondition of anonytmiy.   No casualties were reported when the Moajil-5 grounded on thejetty of Sharjah harbor.</TEXT></DOC>
