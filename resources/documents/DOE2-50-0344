<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-50-0344 </DOCNO><TEXT>Carbon gasification with carbon dioxide was studied thermogravimetrically,and the effect of iron on the reaction was studied quantitatively usinga gas-solid reaction model to account for the changes in the structuraland transport parameters which occur during the course of the reaction,as well as the heat transfer and surface film phenomena involved. Themodel predictions match conversion trends for carbon gasification overthe temperature range from 900 to 1050 degrees C investigated experimentally.Kinetic rate constants k{sub 1} and k/sub c/ and the activation energieswere evaluated from the results obtained. 41 refs., 8 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
