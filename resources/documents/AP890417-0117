The poll of 800 California voters and another 272 San Diego-arearesidents showed support for a four-mile drainage ditch the federalgovernment plans to build along the border to stop Mexicanmotorists from driving into southern California illegally.   ``Californians are strongly concerned about legal and illegalimmigration into that state,'' said Daniel Stein, executivedirector of Federation for American Immigration Reform, whichcommissioned the poll conducted April 6-9 by Tarrance andamp; Associatesof Houston.   The telephone survey, showing increased concern about drugsmuggling across the border and continuing illegal immigration,means that ``we may be looking at a political time bomb for electedofficials,'' he said.   The poll showed that 69 percent of Californians statewidesupported limits on the number of legal immigrants each year.   It also found that 60 percent supported the Immigration andNaturalization Service's plan to build a four-mile drainage ditchin a desert area of San Diego County to stop motorists fromspeeding across unpatrolled border areas.   The ditch was supported by 57 percent of the San Diego-arearesidents, while 31 percent of this group said they opposed theplan. Statewide, 28 percent were opposed.   The San Diego sample had a margin of error of 5.9 percent.   The poll was released two days before the San Diego City Councildebates a proposed resolution to oppose the ditch. A number ofHispanic political groups have lined up against the proposal.   But Stein says the poll shows Hispanic Californians support theditch by a 61-33 percent margin and that Hispanics generallysupport tougher measures to stem illegal immigration.   ``Hispanics, like all other Americans are concerned aboutcompetition on the bottom of the job ladder,'' Stein said.   But the poll also showed that Hispanics split 52-44 percent whenasked if they supported erection of secure fences and barriers tothwart illegal border crossings.   In January, FAIR issued an extensive study proposingconstruction of sunken concrete walls and secure fences to tightenborder security. The organization's membership includes Colorado'sformer Democratic governor, Richard Lamm, former Sen. Walter D.Huddleston, D-Ky., and former Attorney General William French Smith.   Of those surveyed in the San Diego area, 31 percent said theyopposed the ditch while 12 percent said they were unsure.Statewide, 28 percent opposed construction of the ditch while 11percent said they were unsure.   The poll also found overwhelming support among Californians forincreased border security to curb drug smuggling. Sixty-eightpercent of those surveyed statewide said they strongly felt thattighter security was needed to stop cross-border drug trafficking.   Among the San Diego sample, the figure was 73 percent.   The poll showed that 71 percent of California voters approved aproposal to charge a $1 or $2 border crossing fee to finance moreU.S. Customs Service inspectors at the border.</TEXT></DOC>
