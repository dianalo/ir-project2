The behavior of fission products under normaland off-normal reactor conditions is of immediate importance. This volumeaddresses both areas, incorporating timely research papers which complementmodel calculations with experimental data. Seventeen papers include suchtopics as fabrication and performance of large-grained UO/sub 2/-MgOfuel: transient fission product release from UO/sub 2/ under powder rampconditions; mobility of fission-gas bubbles during irradiation; behaviorof deposition fission products released from defected fuel; fission-producttransport from Three Mile Island; fission-produced release from UO/sub2/ under LWR accident conditions; vaporization thermodynamics of fissionproducts from fuel under nuclear accident conditions; and more.</TEXT></DOC>
