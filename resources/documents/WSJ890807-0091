Now she is an entrepreneur.    Last year, the single mother of two children entered Iowa's Self-Employment Investment Demonstration, a pilot project with a herculean task: to help welfare recipients start their own businesses.    Seven months later, she opened Ireland Design andamp; Publishing in her home. Working 12 hours a day on a personal computer, she printed brochures, letterheads and logos for local businesses. Already she has hired an employee, added equipment, moved to an office in Cedar Falls and diversified into producing resumes for students at a nearby university.    Ms. Ireland continues to collect welfare while she gets her business off the ground, but the 30-year-old Iowan plans to cut those strings in December. &quot;You can't work your way off (welfare), you have to jump off,&quot; she says.    From California to Connecticut, cities and states are offering more than 60 such training programs -- most of them pilot projects. All aim for the same goal: to transform welfare recipients into self-sufficient business people.    But critics wonder if the programs' promise of the American dream is overextended. Some say they are too expensive for the number they serve. And while most of the projects are only three or four years old, making it hard to estimate their value, there is evidence that the success rate will be low. Given the high failure rates of small businesses in general, critics question whether program participants -- almost all living at or below the poverty level -- have the business savvy or money to sustain fledgling firms. According to the Small Business Administration, three out of five companies fail within the first six years.    Nonetheless, these and similar programs are gaining momentum. Washington state already is expanding its new welfare-entrepreneur training program. Beginning this fall, the state will allow some people to get a lump-sum advance in unemployment benefits to use as seed capital to start new businesses.    Practically all of the existing welfare-entrepreneur programs follow the same model, offering a combination of training and financial help. Because would-be entrepreneurs must be recipients of Aid to Families with Dependent Children, most applicants are women.    The ranks are further thinned through self-selection: After a few weeks of hearing the time commitment and money involved, not to mention blunt critiques of business plans, many applicants quit. Most of those who continue are women around 30 years old, with high school degrees and some full-time job experience.    After four years on welfare, Shirley Kelley signed up for a self-employment training program in St. Paul, Minn., hoping to turn a profit with her cooking skills. In three months at the Women's Economic Development Corp., a private organization, she picked up basic accounting and marketing strategy and learned how to write a business plan for the catering business she wanted to launch.    As part of the program, all &quot;prohibitive&quot; federal rules concerning her income were waived. Normally, she couldn't have more than $1,000 in financial assets without losing her benefits. The waiver allowed Ms. Kelley to lay aside money to start her business.    With a $5,000 loan from a program fund, she bought cooking utensils and a cash register, and hired two employees. Today, Kelley's Gourmet Catering serves shrimp scampi, potato salad and other dishes at business luncheons and weddings all over St. Paul. She also runs a kitchen for a local social-service program.    &quot;I'm still a long ways from where I want to be,&quot; says Ms. Kelley, &quot;but I feel like I've opened some doors.&quot;    Program directors admit the task is anything but easy. &quot;It's the supreme challenge,&quot; says Kathryn Keeley, president of the Women's Economic Development Corp., where Ms. Kelley got her assistance. &quot;It's like a salmon swimming upstream in a drought.&quot;    The Corporation for Enterprise Development, a nonprofit economic research firm in Washington, D.C., runs similar self-employment pilot programs in Minnesota, Michigan, Mississippi and Iowa. It, too, concedes that the task is enormous. Early evidence from those programs suggests the odds are less than favorable: Out of 543 initial program recruits surveyed in a preliminary study, 187 enrolled in the training phase. Of those, only 29 actually started businesses. And it's too early to know how many of those will survive.    The CED's programs cost between $3,000 and $5,000 per person who starts a business. The figure includes nonrecurring start-up costs and evaluations. Participating states will need to spend about $1 million during the four-year pilot project, the CED says.    Slightly older programs in France and the U.K. -- the models for many U.S. programs -- have shown that only 2% to 3% of the trained welfare recipients actually succeed in small businesses, according to data cited by the National Conference of State Legislatures.    Besides pointing to the low success rate, critics say the programs help only recipients who would have succeeded anyway. They note that most enrollees who actually start businesses are more educated than the others and have more work experience in full-time jobs.    The &quot;self-employment option is not meaningful for the severely disadvantaged, the long-term unemployed or young job seekers with little job experience,&quot; says Marc Bendick of Bendick andamp; Egan Economic Consultants Inc. in Washington, D.C., who has studied such programs in Europe for the past five years.    Many also wonder how welfare recipients can raise enough money to finance a firm, when conventional entrepreneurs can barely find adequate capital.    &quot;It begs the first question any entrepreneur should ask: Will I be able to raise some basic funds?&quot; says Sar Levitan, director of the Center for Social Policy Studies at George Washington University. &quot;I'm all for a comprehensive welfare system, but this is very risky.&quot;    Program directors counter that loan funds have been set up to help the fledgling firms. Many banks have come to the aid of enrollees, knowing they have the backing of the state programs.    More important, proponents say that even a few success stories make the programs worthwhile. &quot;This is not a panacea,&quot; says Robert Friedman, president and founder of the CED, the Washington, D.C., group that organizes such programs. &quot;It may only provide an escape for a relatively small percentage of recipients.&quot; But, he adds, if you can uncover that entrepreneurial drive, &quot;it makes people look at who they are. We want to build on that capacity.&quot;    Mr. Friedman, who has written a book on the concept, says this sort of entrepreneurial training gives low-income neighborhoods new role models. And the training helps many find jobs and get off welfare even if they don't start businesses, he adds. Although the programs are costly, through savings on discontinued welfare payments and increased revenue from taxes on new businesses, Mr. Friedman argues that they can pay for themselves.    ---@ Profile of Welfare Entrepreneurs    Characteristics of enrollees in Self-Employment Investment Demonstration of Corporation for Enterprise Development, Washington, D.C. @ High school diploma ........................ 88% @ Ever employed for pay ...................... 98 @ Receiving Aid to Families With Dependent @ Children for two or more years .............. 66 @ Age @ Teens 0 @ Twenties 30 @ Thirties 50 @ Forties 18 @ Fifties 2 @ Ethnicity @ White 69 @ Black 25 @ Asian or Pacific Islander 3 @ Native American 1 @ Hispanic 3    NOTE: Percentage for ethnicity add to over 100 due to rounding    Source: Manpower Demostration Research Corp.
