Part ofthe problem, aside from their inherent complexity, has been the difficultyof measuring their source location and emission properties from limitedobservations. Progress has been made on this problem by locating thesource directly, i.e., by analysis of the faraday rotation observed withVoyager as the wave path crossed the Io plasma torus, and indirectlyby comparing the peak frequencies of the decametric emission with thatat the foot of the Io flux tube. Progress was also made on the generalquestion of how the emissions originate by finding properties of boththe AKR and DAM which would imply emission by natural radio lasing.</TEXT></DOC>
