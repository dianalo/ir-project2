Today Drexel remains an outsider on Wall Street, but for adifferent reason. The firm became one of the Street's biggest andmost aggressive firms by capitalizing on markets ignored by itsrivals, and in the process revolutionized corporate finance ingeneral and takeovers in particular.   Now, Drexel is in trouble.   The Securities and Exchange Commission said Wednesday it hasfiled civil insider trading charges against Drexel and MichaelMilken, head of Drexel's junk bond trading unit.   Drexel traces its roots to the founding of Burnham andamp; Co. in1935, although the pedigree of Drexel Firestone, which Burnhamacquired in 1973, goes back to the 1830s and once counted J.P.Morgan among its partners.   By the mid-1970s Drexel was languishing in the second tier ofinvestment banks when it decided to pursue a business largelyignored by its competitors _ the market for ``junk bonds.''   Junk bonds refer to corporate debt that credit-rating agenciesconsider more speculative than top-ranked ``investment grade''bonds with respect to the company's ability to meet the debt'spayments.   Drexel did not invent junk bonds. But the junk bonds that werearound originally had been issued with a higher credit rating andhad since slipped to junk, ``fallen angel,'' status.   Drexel's novel plan was to sell junk bonds as original issues,and to reward investors who bought the bonds by paying them higheryields than they could get on investment-grade securities.   The junk-bond market then exploded, in large part because Drexelcultivated ties with a stable of investors willing to buy thesecurities. Companies, in turn, rushed to have Drexel sell theirjunk bonds with the knowledge those investors stood as ready buyers.   In addition, many companies avoided or were unable to borrowhuge sums because, despite being relatively healthy, they did notqualify for an investment-grade rating. But Drexel specialized infinding companies that could profitably support junk bonds even ifthe credit-rating agencies deemed the securities to be below topgrade.   Leading the Drexel underwriting effort was Frederick H. Joseph,a relaxed, soft-spoken Boston native who was then head of corporatefinance and is now Drexel's chief executive.   Drexel simultaneously became the premier trader of junk bondsunder the leadership of Michael R. Milken, a publicity-shy andintense Californian who moved Drexel's junk-bond trading operationto Beverly Hills from New York in 1977.   The pair led Drexel to a near monopoly on the mushroomingmarket. But it was not until the early 1980s that Drexel hit on theidea that made it one of top investment banks and simultaneouslyrevolutionized the mergers and acquisitions business: Using junkbonds to finance takeovers, particularly hostile ones.   Suddenly, a bidder with relatively few dollars could go after amultibillion-dollar company, armed with Drexel's ability to quicklyraise most of the financing by floating more junk bonds.   ``Corporate raiders'' such as Carl Icahn, Sir James Goldsmith,Saul Steinberg and T. Boone Pickens Jr. did just that by enlistingDrexel's help, and by 1985 Drexel had become the most fearedinvestment bank in corporate America.   Yet incumbent managers at many companies also used Drexel'sjunk-bond expertise to finance leveraged buyouts, in which themanagers acquired the companies and took them private.   The result is a junk-bond market that has burgeoneddramatically, to $159 billion in 1987 from $24 billion in 1977. Itgrew 27 percent last year, from $125 billion in 1986, in spite ofunfavorable publicity.   Along the way, Drexel has earned enormous fees for underwritingand trading junk bonds and for its takeover advice.   Drexel's capital as of Dec. 31, 1987, totaled nearly $2.2billion, up from $1.8 billion the previous year and up more thantenfold from 1981. That made the privately held company the fifthlargest firm on Wall Street.   Although Drexel still is the dominant player in junk bonds, themarket's huge growth drew competition from other investment banks.   Drexel's influence in the takeover game began to diminishsomewhat amid the insider-trading scandal on Wall Street, whicherupted with the arrest of a Drexel investment banker, Dennis R.Levine, and then led to a government investigation of Drexel'stactics.   Still, Drexel had denied suggestions that the probe severelyimpaired the firm, claiming its junk-bond business and its otherinvestment banking operations remained strong.</TEXT></DOC>
