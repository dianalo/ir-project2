Not that Chamberlain has been a stranger to the tube. He hasbeen bouncing around the world the past few years filmingminiseries.   In his latest, he co-stars with Jacyln Smith in ``The BourneIdentity,'' based on Robert Ludlum's spy thriller, which ABC willtelevise in two parts on Sunday and Monday.   Chamberlain is now developing a regular series, his first sincehe quit ``Dr. Kildare'' in 1966 and took off to England to shed hisboyish image and become a serious actor.   ``We've hit on a wonderful idea, which I can't talk about,'' hesays. ``We took the idea to CBS and Lorimar and got a deal for 13shows.''   Chamberlain is quite ready to relinquish his title as the ``kingof the miniseries'' and have work that will keep him off the road.   ``I'm tired of this gypsy life,'' says Chamberlain, just backfrom four months in Europe filming the Ludlum story.   ``I hadn't anticipated doing another series. But I wanted tofind a way to settle down. When you do a series you're at thestudio all the time, but you do get to go home at night.''   Smith, the former ``Charlie's Angel'' who's known as the ``queenof the miniseries,'' also doesn't want to travel as much now thather children are approaching school age. She's looking for a comedyseries.   About his role in ``The Bourne Identity,'' Chamberlain says:   ``Jason Bourne is a fascinating character, very complex, verydivided. He's basically a scholar and teacher, but he has becomethis terribly efficient undercover agent. The story begins when hehas been shot in the head and washes up on shore in the South ofFrance with amnesia.   ``All he knows is that he has a Swiss bank account with $15million and everyone is trying to kill him. Evidence begins tobuild that he is the notorious terrorist Carlos. He takes JackieSmith hostage. Then they fall in love. She ends up saving him.''   The story, like all of those by Ludlum, is terribly complicated,but it has been simplified by screenwriter Carol Sobieski. It wasdirected on location by Roger Young.   ``There's a lot of mystery about the character,'' Chamberlainsays. ``Not only for the audience but for him as well. Carol hastaken the story and kept it clear and simple.''   Filming started last year in Nice, on the Riviera, then after aChristmas break moved to London, Zurich, Paris and back to Zurich.   ``We were terrified before starting that Zurich would be 30below zero,'' Chamberlain says. ``But we had an incredible break inthe weather. It was a very warm winter. Paris was more stunninglybeautiful than ever.   ``We had a lot of phone booth scenes, because it figures in theplot. We carried our own phone booth with us. We set it up in PlaceVendome, which is sacred to the French. People driving by couldn'tbelieve it.   ``This is a very physical role. We had a lot of fights and carchases. In Zurich I rescue Marie (Jaclyn Smith) from a fate worsethan death and get beat up in the process. We filmed six nights ina row in Zurich. We had so many scenes with a streetcar that werented our own.''   Before going to Europe, Chamberlain spent six months in New Yorkdoing ``Blithe Spirit'' on Broadway.   Most of his projects have kept him away from home. He was inJapan for six months for ``Shogun,'' in Yugoslavia three months for``Wallenberg,'' and in Africa for eight months for ``King Solomon'sMines.''   Other projects also took him many places. For ``Centennial,'' toColorado; for ``Three Musketeers,'' to England; for ``Cook andPerry,'' to Canada, and for ``Dream West,'' to Arizona. ``The ThornBirds'' was the only miniseries filmed here.   He's also developing a new theatrical movie based on the novel``Say Goodbye to Sam.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, May 8</NOTE></DOC>
