They are Oxford-educated professors fromIndia, wealthy families chased from Idi Amin's Uganda, factoryowners fleeing Afghanistan's upheavals. They are America's newimmigrants, arriving via Concorde, not a refugee boat.   They have found a voice in Bharati Mukherjee, a self-describedHindu Bengali Brahmin who was raised in affluence in Bombay, India,educated in British and Swiss schools before receiving a master'sand doctorate at the University of Iowa, and who last year became anAmerican citizen.   In January, her sixth book, ``The Middleman and Other Stories''(Grove Press, $15.95), won the prestigious National Book CriticsCircle Award. The honor has been gratifying for two reasons, shesaid in a recent interview.   First, it has put the book, published last spring, back on theshelves. But far more importantly, she said, it has shown a``marvelous curiosity and adventurousness'' on the part of theliterary establishment to select such an unconventional book.   ``A country that allows a writer from a minority community or amarginalized group to be included as a voice in mainstream Americanliterature _ now that's a tribute to the country,'' said Mukherjee,a slight, thoughtful woman with a relaxed laugh and exquisite poiseduring the interview at The Associated Press offices.   She was asked if she chose the title ``The Middleman'' becauseimmigrants are, in effect, middlemen _ shuttling between theirnative and adopted countries.   ``Immigrants are middlemen, and I also feel that America is goingthrough transition, that the country has changed since the 1970swith the fast influx of immigrants from non-traditional countries,''she said. ``We are in many ways similar to the European, andespecially the Jewish, influx of 30 to 40 years ago. But in manysignificant ways, we who are coming from Asia and the Caribbean arevery dissimilar, very distinct. ...   ``For many of my characters, as it was for me, coming to Americais a social comedown. I had a life of ease and privilege which Ihave chosen to not to want to continue by living in the UnitedStates _ a social demotion. I'll never have that kind of money andphysical comfort in this country.''   Mukherjee, 48, who has lived in North America for 28 years, haswholeheartedly embraced the United States. She said she thinks ofthis collection of short stories as ``my tribute to America. This isfinally my very American book, and I want the exuberance to reflectthe kind of exuberance that this country has released in me thatnone of the countries I have lived in have.''   While studying at the University of Iowa, Mukherjee met andmarried Clark Blaise, a novelist, and the two moved to Canada in1968 to teach and write. They both became Canadian citizens, butleft that country in the late '70s because of racial prejudice andphysical harassment of foreigners there. The couple came to theUnited States and now live in New York City, where Mukherjee teachesfull-time at Queens College and part-time at Columbia and New Yorkuniversities.   She has written two novels, ``The Tiger's Daughter'' and``Wife,'' and a previous collection of short stories, ``Darkness.''She also has collaborated on two non-fiction books with her husband,``Days and Nights in Calcutta'' and ``The Sorrow and the Terror.''The latter is about the 1985 Air India flight that crashed overIreland, killing 329 people.   ``The Middleman'' is a departure for her because she now feelscomfortable adopting the persona of white Americans when needed. Infact, this collection's power lies in the enormous range ofcharacters and locales so convincingly portrayed _ a Vietnam vet whobecomes a hired killer in Florida, a Trinidad woman who sneaks intoAmerica from Canada and finds work as an au pair, a Sri Lankan highschool teacher who gets stranded in West Germany, a young woman froma close Italian family trying to introduce her Afghan lover to herblue-collar parents.   ``When I'm with Ro I feel I am looking at America through thewrong end of a telescope,'' thinks the woman with the Afghan loverin the story ``Orbiting.''   ``He makes it sound like a police state, with sudden raids,papers, detention centers, deportations, and torture and deathwaiting in the wings.''   Other characters see America as Disneyland, a nation of infiniteplenty where adults act like overfed children.   Mukherjee said she is not surprised at Americans' ignorance ofevents and geography beyond their borders. ``I remember as a kid inCalcutta, where we had to know street names in London and Paris ...because real life was lived elsewhere, and whatever life we livedwas somewhat devalued by colonialism and post-colonialism. I enviedAmericans their insularity.''   America will learn about the rest of the world when geopoliticalevents force it to, she predicted. And perhaps the literary world'srecognition of ``The Middleman'' is a small step toward increasingunderstanding of this new and different generation of immigrants.   ``The people I'm writing about have had no voice in Americanliterature,'' she said. ``And I think one of my tasks becomessensitizing editors of magazines, saying, `Look, we all exist outthere. The people you sit next to on the No. 7 train have enormousstories to tell.'''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Weekend Editions, Feb 17-19</NOTE></DOC>
