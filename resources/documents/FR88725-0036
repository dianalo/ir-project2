The assessmentprovides a basis for the conclusion that the field testing of these geneticallyengineered tobacco plants does not present a risk of plant pest introductionor dissemination and also will not have any significant impact on the qualityof the human environment.

The rule regulates the introduction(importation, interstate movement, and release into the environment) ofgenetically engineered organisms and products which are plant pests orwhich there is reason to believe are plant pests (regulated articles).The rule sets forth procedures for obtaining a permit for the release intothe environment of a regulated article and for obtaining limited permitsfor the importation or interstate movement of a regulated article. A permitmust be obtained before a regulated article can be introduced in the UnitedStates.APHIS has stated that it would prepare environmental assessments and, wherenecessary, environmental impact statements prior to issuing a permit forthe release into the environment of a regulated article (see 52 FR 22906).Iowa State University (Iowa State) has submitted an application for a permitfor release into the environment of genetically engineered tobacco plantsthat are modified to express a chimeric proteinase inhibitor II promoter-chloramphenicalacetyl transferase gene. Expression of the gene will enable researchersto evaluate changes in the physiology of the plant brought about by insectdamage. In the course of reviewing the permit application, APHIS assessedthe impact to the environment of releasing the tobacco plants under theconditions described in the Iowa State application. APHIS concluded thatthe field testing will not present a risk of plant pest introduction ordissemination and will also not have any significant impact on the qualityof the human environment.The environmental assessment and finding of no significant impact whichis based on data submitted by Iowa State, as well as a review of otherrelevant literature, provides the public with documentation of APHIS' reviewand analysis of the environmental impacts associated with conducting thefield testing.The facts supporting APHIS' finding of no significant impact are summarizedbelow and are contained in the environmental assessment.1. A chimeric gene which has the effect of making tobacco plants expressa bacterial chloramphenicol acetyl transferase gene has been inserted intoa tobacco chromosome. In nature, the genetic material contained in a chromosomecan only be transferred to another sexually compatible plant by cross-pollination.In this field test trial, the inserted chimeric gene cannot spread to anyother sexually compatible plant by cross-pollination because the fieldtest plot is located at a sufficient distance from any sexually compatibleplant with which these experimental tobacco plants could successfully cross-pollinate.2. Neither the proteinase inhibitor II promoter or terminator signal sequences,the chloramphenicol acetyl transferase gene itself, nor the chlorampenicolacetyl transferase gene derived product confers on tobacco any plant pestcharacteristic.3. The potato variety, from which the proteinase inhibitor II promoterand terminator signal sequences were obtained, is not a plant pest.4. The chimeric proteinase inhibitor II promoter-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene does not provide the genetically engineered tobacco plantswith any measurable selective advantage over nongenetically engineeredtobacco plants in its ability to be disseminated or to become establishedin the environment.5. The vector used to transfer the chimeric proteinase inhibitor II promoter-chloramphenicolacetyl transferase gene into a tobacco chromosome has been evaluated forits use in this experiment. The vector, although derived from DNA withknown plant pathogenic potential, has been disarmed; that is, genes whichare necessary to confer plant pathogenic traits have been removed fromthe vector. The vector has been tested and shown to be not pathogenic toany susceptible plant.6. The vector agent, the bacterium which was used to deliver the vectorencoding the chimeric gene into a tobacco plant cell, has been demonstratedto be eliminated and no longer associated with any genetically engineeredtobacco plant or seed.7. Horizontal movement by infectious transfer or transposition of any ofthe introduced genes or DNA sequences is not known to be possible. Thevector acts by delivering the gene to the tobacco genome where it is stablyinserted into the tobacco chromosomal DNA. The vector cannot replicateindependently of its vector agent and does not survive alone in any plant.No mechanism of horizontal movement is known to exist in nature to movean inserted gene from a chromosome of a genetically engineered plant toany other organism.8. The size of the field test trial plot is small (50 feet by 120 feet).Site monitoring and management practices that create an unfavorable environmentfor the dissemination of any genetically engineered tobacco plant or plantgenetic material are expected to provide the necessary degree of both biologicaland physical containment.The environmental assessment and finding of no significant impact has beenprepared in accordance with (1) The National Environmental Policy Act of1969 (NEPA) (42 U.S.C. 4321 <T3>et seq.</T3>); (2) Regulations of the Council on Environmental Qualityfor Implementing the Procedural Provisions of NEPA (Title 40, Code of FederalRegulations (CFR) Parts 1500-1508); (3) USDA Regulations Implementing NEPA(7 CFR Part 1b); and (4) APHIS Guidelines Implementing NEPA (44 FR 50381-50384and 44 FR 51272-51274).<ITAG tagnum="21">Done at Washington, DC, this 20th day of July 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Larry B.
