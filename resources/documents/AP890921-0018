ROSENTHAL</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Transportation officials believe new securityrules brought on by the explosion that destroyed a Pan Americanairliner over Lockerbie, Scotland, make flying U.S. carriers inEurope and the Middle East as safe as possible.   ``Nothing is 100 percent, but we try,'' said Fred Farrar, aspokesman for the Federal Aviation Administration, which orderedsecurity procedures tightened after the Dec. 21, 1988 bomb blastthat killed 270.   ``The airlines are doing a lot,'' said Tim Neale, a spokesman forthe Air Transport Association, an industry group. ``We spend a halfbillion dollars a year on security.''   The new rules imposed by the FAA since the Pan Am 103 explosioninclude a requirement that U.S. airlines operating in Europe and theMiddle East X-ray or physically search all checked luggage. Acertain percentage of the luggage is searched by hand.   The new FAA regulations apply only to U.S. carriers.   Air carriers operating in and out of 40 high-risk airports arerequired to make ``a positive passenger-baggage match,'' designed toensure that no piece of luggage gets on an airplane unless thepassenger who checked it is also aboard.   And the installation of automatic devices for detectingexplosives in checked luggage has begun, with the first installed atNew York City's John F. Kennedy International Airport. The ThermalNeutron Analysis Machine costs $750,000 to $1 million.   ``We have issued a rule requiring airlines to provide deviceslike this and have them installed in 40 airports here and abroadwithin 1{ years,'' Farrar said.   Asked whether the explosive-sniffer could have detected the bombhidden in a radio-cassette player which blew the Boeing 747 airlinerapart, Farrar said: ``We are confident it could have caught it.''   ATA's Neale was not so sure.   ``It's hard to say,'' he said. ``We still don't know for sureexactly what happened there. It's like a moving target, you areconstantly readjusting.''   Airline security originally was designed to counter hijackings ofplanes, mainly to Cuba.   ``Now, it's an entirely different threat, it's more sabotage thanhijacking,'' said Neale. ``Defenses have to be changed and the newrequirements are intended to do that.''   There is no single answer to terrorism, he said. ``The idea is toset up a new series of roadblocks.''   U.S. airlines are frustrated, he said, because there is aperception among the traveling public that flying a foreign carrieris safer.   But, he said, ``the U.S. carriers are the only ones physicallyinspecting and X-raying all checked luggage now.'' Overseasairlines, he said, use the ``profile'' system in which addedattention is paid to a passenger who has behavior patterns ormatches statistical data characteristic of hijackers.</TEXT></DOC>
