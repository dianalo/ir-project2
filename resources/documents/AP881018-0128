The cuts, totaling $697 million annually, would take effect Dec.1, the day that residential and small business customers beginpaying an additional 60 cents per month to pay the costs ofmaintaining the local phone network.   ATandamp;T estimates that subscribers who make at least $16 a month ininterstate, long-distance calls would offset the addition of thesubscriber line charge. The average residential customer spends$8.66 per month on interstate, long-distance calls, the companysaid. Those totals do not include intrastate long-distance calls.   As subscribers pay more of the costs to maintain the localnetwork, long-distance companies pay less. The FederalCommunications Commission requires ATandamp;T, the nation's largestlong-distance company, to send these savings back to consumers bylowering rates.   ATandamp;T's competitors are not required to return these savings tocustomers, but the companies have tended to lower their rates inresponse to ATandamp;T price cuts.   The two largest competitors, MCI Communications Corp. and USSprint Communications Co., said Monday they would review ATandamp;T'splans.   MCI spokesman John Houser said the company ``will maintain acompetitive rate structure'' and ``will be passing the access linesavings along to our customers.'' But he said MCI could not bespecific until it has fully reviewed ATandamp;T's proposal.   Sprint spokesman Syd Courson said the company wanted to reviewATandamp;T's proposed cuts before commenting on its own plans. ``We don'tknow what we will do right now,'' he said.   The price cut, if approved by the FCC, would be ATandamp;T's seventhsince 1984, when the company was stripped of its local operatingcompanies by an antitrust decree. Since then, ATandamp;T's rates havefallen 38 percent.   Subscribers, however, pay $2.60 per month for local networkcosts in a fee called the subscriber line charge, which was firstimposed in 1985 as a way to shift the costs of the local network tolocal customers. That charge is scheduled to rise to $3.20 permonth on Dec. 1.   A consumer advocate, Gene Kimmelman of the Consumer Federationof America, said he was concerned that ATandamp;T has structured its ratecut to benefit the company's special discount services designed forlarge users.   As an example, he pointed to ATandamp;T's proposal to cut rates forits volume discount plan called Reach Out America by 4.9 percent,but drop basic long-distance rates by only 3.8 percent.   The 3.8 percent decrease would apply to basic long-distancerates for calls traveling more than 124 miles. The decrease wouldbe about the same for daytime, evening and weekend calling periods,ATandamp;T said.   Rates for calls of shorter distances, which account for aboutone-quarter of ATandamp;T's interstate calls, would be lowered by 1.1percent. The company cited the need ``to maintain acceptable profitlevels'' on those shorter-distance calls.   The highest cut would come in rates for ATandamp;T's Software DefinedNetwork Service, which would drop 6.2 percent.   WATS rates would be cut by 4 percent, and ATandamp;T would restructurethe service to bill calls individually based on time and distance,rather than by the current hourly pricing method. This pricereduction would take effect Jan. 1, a month later than the others.   Rates for ATandamp;T's three PRO WATS calling plans for businesscustomers would be cut 3.8 percent overall. MEGACOM WATS rateswould drop 4.7 percent and MEGACOM 800 rates would decrease 4.8percent, while basic ATandamp;T 800 service prices would go down 4percent.</TEXT></DOC>
