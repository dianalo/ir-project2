U.S. Park Police estimated that the dawn-to-dusk ``Washingtonfor Jesus in '88'' rally attracted 150,000 people.   Organizers emphasized the racial, ethnic and religious diversityof the crowd. They said they hoped the gathering would show allAmericans that Christians remain as ardent and unified as ever,despite the well-publicized downfall of television evangelistsJimmy Swaggart and Jim and Tammy Bakker.   ``The world thought the scandals of the last year brought thechurch to its knees,'' James Kennedy of Coral Ridge PresbyterianChurch in Florida said. ``The church will arise from its knees,cleaner and purer and stronger.''   The gathering was meant to be non-political, which was whyorganizers said Republican presidential candidate Pat Robertson wasnot invited. Robertson was one of the main speakers at a similarrally in Washington eight years ago.   In fact, Reagan was the only national political figure to speakto the crowd.   ``Today, American society must face serious problems, fromwithin and without, which threaten to steal our liberties anddestroy our freedoms,'' Reagan said. ``Abortion, child abuse,pornography and drug addiction eat away at our most preciousnational resource _ our children.   ``Yet we do not falter in the face of such evil for there is awind of prayer blowing throughout our land.''   Earlier, evangelist Oral Roberts of Tulsa, Okla., made a briefspeech recalling how ``a man of God'' laid hands on him and curedhim of tuberculosis when he was 17.   ``I stand here today, 53 years later with my lungs sound andwhole, my body healed by the power of God,'' he said as members ofthe audience applauded.   One of the first speakers of the day was the Rev. GeraldDerstine of Bradenton, Fla., who urged ``Christians to offerprayers of ``repentance for the sins of the naion.''   ``I am talking about drug addiction, alcoholism and suicides. Wefeel prayer in the schools is still an important issue and webelieve abortion still is an issue,'' Derstine said.   Such sentiments were echoed in the banners and signs carried byrally participants. One banner said, ``Take drugs out of ourschools and put God back in.'' Another sign said, ``Jesus forgivessinning, let him.''   One of the rally-goers, Michael Goldbloom, assistant pastor ofFull Gospel Tabernacle in Philadelphia, said he thought itsignificant that the rally was being held in the nation's capital.``I believe a public display of prayer and repentence will letWashington know and the country know that people still love God,''he said.</TEXT></DOC>
