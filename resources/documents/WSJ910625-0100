Forecasts of rain over the past weekend failed tomaterialize, and meteorologists now say that some regions ofIllinois and Indiana may register their driest June in 40years. The crop's need for moisture becomes increasinglycritical during late June and early July, because that's whenthe corn crop pollinates, or begins development of the actualkernels of corn.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;The corn crop is at its most weather-sensitive stage atthis time of year,&quot; said Peter Leavitt, executive vicepresident of of Weather Services Corp., Bedford, Mass.   During the next two to three weeks, strands of whatfarmers call &quot;silk&quot; will emerge from developing corn cobs topollinate individual kernels of corn. Excessive heat duringthis period can burn the strands and thwart pollination,reducing the size of corn cobs and leaving holes wherekernels of corn should be.   &quot;The silk dries out and it can't transfer pollen to thekernel, as it should,&quot; Mr. Leavitt said. &quot;You get a blank inthe ear, and you don't get a kernel formed in there. Also,heat can actually sterilize the pollen.&quot;   Forecasts call for temperatures in the 90s across much ofthe Midwest by late this week, moving above 100 degrees insome southern growing regions. There is very little rain inthe forecast.   At the Chicago Board of Trade, the price of the corncontract for December delivery rose 4.50 cents a bushelyesterday to settle at $2.4025. Analysts said traders havebegun to speculate that the persistently hot and dry weatherthis month may take its toll on the crop.   &quot;Pollination is going to start around July 5 in thesouthern Midwest and extend north a little later in July,&quot;said Daniel Basse, director of market research for AgResourceCo., Chicago. A continuing lack of rain, he said, couldcontinue to exert upward pressure on corn future prices.   Soybean futures prices also rose yesterday onweather-based concerns, but the soybean crop isn't asvulnerable as corn. That's because the soybean crop wasplanted later -- and has the ability to go into asemi-dormant state to protect itself from periods ofexcessive heat in the early summer. The &quot;make or break time&quot;for soybeans tends to be later in the summer -- usually inAugust -- when it, too, is at the mercy of hot weather.   The price of the soybean contract for July deliveryyesterday rose 3.25 cents to $5.66 a bushel.   The bad news for corn and soybean farmers is good news forwheat farmers, who need dry weather to continue harvestingtheir crops of hard red winter wheat. Analysts said theharvest is proceeding rapidly across the southern Midwest.The price of the July wheat contract declined 0.75 cent tosettle at $2.71 a bushel.   In other commodity markets yesterday:                                                                                                          PRECIOUS METALS: Silver futures fell sharply in a sell-offthat began in Tokyo Monday. The selling appeared to berelated to the scandal that major Japanese brokeragecompanies reimbursed big clients for losses, said WilliamO'Neill, futures strategist at Merrill Lynch. Silver for Julydelivery traded as low as $4.25 an ounce early in the sessionbut recouped some of the losses to end at $4.35, down threecents. Because it was based on a one-time event, the sell-offshouldn't have a long-term effect, he added. David Sobotka,manager of bullion trading at Shearson Lehman Brothers, notedthat silver also fell Friday as disappointed investors, whohad bet the price would rise, took profits. The weakness inthe CRB Futures Index, which closed yesterday at 210.25, down0.77 point, is a signal to people that inflation isn't aproblem and there's no need to rush into precious metals, Mr.Sobotka added. Precious metals are considered by someinvestors as a hedge against inflation. Bernard Savaiko,senior metals analyst at PaineWebber, noted that silver'sclosing price was higher than its opening, which mightindicate the selling has run its course.                                                                                                          ENERGY: Crude oil futures prices fell in moribund tradingon the New York Mercantile Exchange. One trader said that &quot;itwas a dead day.&quot; Petroleum products trading was alsolackluster. Crude for August delivery lost 25 cents a barrelto end the trading session at $19.98 and outer monthsfinished lower, as well. Volume for crude oil contracts wasan anemic 36,625 contracts. July gasoline lost 0.24 cent tosettle at 60.89 cents a gallon. Heating oil lost even moreground than gasoline, falling 0.57 cent to 53.76 cents agallon for July. Analysts and traders attributed the fall inheating oil to profit-taking following last week's priceincreases.                                                                                                          COTTON: Futures prices plunged. Cotton for July deliveryfell 4.09 cents a pound to 78.4 cents. October and Decembercotton also fell sharply. Yesterday was the first day forsellers of July cotton to make known their intentions todeliver the fiber. Notices on 129 contracts, representingabout 13,000 bales of cotton, were tendered, toward the lowerend of expectations, said Sandra Kaul, an analyst at ShearsonLehman Brothers. But traders were concerned by the lack ofinterest from major cotton trade houses in the cotton, anespecially troubling development to some traders who expect100,000 bales to be delivered in July, Ms. Kaul said. Alsocontributing to the decline was selling by speculators whoheld bets the price would rise but liquidated their positionsto avoid taking delivery of cotton. The price of the Julycontract will have to come down relative to later deliveriesto make it worthwhile for the cotton industry to takedelivery of the cotton now, she added.</TEXT></DOC>
