After selling its Pacific routes for $750 million this year, it seemed Pan Am might be able to keep a comfortable cash cushion. But terrorism, the weak dollar and the Chernobyl nuclear accident curbed summer transatlantic travel. Pan Am had a loss of $265 million in the first nine months of 1986, and a deficit of about $80 million is expected for the fourth quarter.    As a result, Pan Am is already back in the money markets, trying to raise $225 million by putting up more airplanes as collateral for a series of junk-bond issues. But at the same time, the company has been the subject of two baleful reports by Morgan Stanley, one strongly urging sale of Pan Am stock.    Morgan Stanley airline analyst Kevin Murphy said last week that Pan Am's cash position had declined to $277 million from $551 million in the third quarter. Fourth-quarter traffic has been weaker than expected, he said, and Pan Am is unlikely to show revenue gains in the first half of 1987.    The report said Pan Am's average compensation of $46,300 for each employee remains high, particularly compared with Continental's $28,200. The airline plans to spend $1.1 billion on 28 new aircraft in 1987-90. And it has a $450 million unfunded pension liability.    &quot;Chairman Edward C. Acker has been attempting to turn Pan Am around since he joined the company in late 1981, but it does not appear that current management will be able to reverse the carrier's declining fortunes,&quot; Mr. Murphy said.    Pan Am's stock price last saw double digits in 1978. And the company has been shedding assets ever since the early 1980s sales of its hotel business and Manhattan office tower.    The Morgan Stanley analyst doubts that a buyer would offer more than the market price for Pan Am. In the meantime, he says, the airline has enough money to get through the first quarter of 1987 but &quot;remains vulnerable to any adverse economic developments, owing to its limited financial resources.&quot;    Pan Am was limited in its response to Mr. Murphy's critique because it is in registration with a $150 million offering by Merrill Lynch of junk bonds secured by 13 aircraft. Jeff Kriendler, vice president, corporate communications, said the planned aircraft purchases will reduce Pan Am's costs, and he attributed the expected weak revenue performance in the first half of 1987 to a drop in capacity.    One of the few analysts who strongly defends Pan Am and recommends the stock is John Pincavage of PaineWebber. The securities concern is working on another issue of $75 million in bonds to be sold privately.    Mr. Pincavage says, &quot;There are a lot of positives here that are obscured when you go in and say they've lost a lot of money and their cash position is down.&quot; He says Pan Am has boosted its average yield, or revenue for each passenger mile, and cut its break-even load factor, or percentage of seats it needs to fill, to 59% from 67% this year.    However, many other analysts say Pan Am erred in not reducing its transatlantic capacity as TWA did in response to the reduced traffic this summer.    One of the most critical is Helene Becker of Drexel Burnham Lambert, who says: &quot;I don't think the assets have been well managed. I just think they're spending too much money. Since 1982, we've had four years of excuses. Every year they say, 'This is the year we're going to do well.'&quot;    Julius Maldutis of Salomon Brothers has recommended selling the stock since early this year, saying, &quot;I have been concerned about the company's inability to reduce its losses.&quot; But although Mr. Acker hasn't taken the hard-nosed actions of a Carl Icahn or Frank Lorenzo, Pan Am's stock is above the below-$3 levels that prevailed just before he arrived. It closed yesterday at 4 1/2, down 3/8, and led the most-active list.    Analysts estimate this year's loss at roughly $2.75 a share and forecast anywhere from a 60-cent-a-share loss to a 50-cent-a-share profit for 1987. But most believe Pan Am will have plenty of cash to keep flying until next summer. &quot;That's the acid test, how they fare next summer,&quot; says Robert Joedicke of Shearson Lehman.    Candice Browning of Wertheim estimates that the entire company might fetch $8 a share in a sale. &quot;Barring another disastrous summer on the order of what they had this year, they could continue for quite some time,&quot; she says.    Although Mr. Murphy of Morgan Stanley notes that the Merrill Lynch offering will leave Pan Am with only nine of its 50 owned aircraft unencumbered by debt, Pan Am has plenty of other assets, such as international routes, airport landing rights and its brand name.    It was Morgan Stanley customers who learned the hard way this summer what can go wrong with airline junk bonds, issued in this case by People Express. Those bonds, sold by Morgan Stanley, suffered steep losses as Texas Air negotiated to acquire People Express. Although the prices later recovered somewhat, holders had to accept reduced interest rates.    ---   Pan Am   (NYSE; Symbol: PN)   Business: Airline   Year ended Dec. 31, 1985:   Revenue: $3.48 billion   Net income: $51.8 million, or 45 cents a share    Third quarter, Sept. 30, 1986:    Per-share earnings: 4 cents vs. 18 cents (primary)    Average daily trading volume:   577,679 shares (November)   Common shares outstanding:   136.4 million</TEXT></DOC>
