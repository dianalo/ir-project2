Robinson III, who runs American Express Co., lately has devoted a lot of time to a single corner of his vast and far-flung travel and financial-services empire: Shearson Lehman Bros. Inc. Melded by Amex out of some of Wall Street's most famous brokerage and investment-banking names, Shearson has become both a joy and a trial.    On the joy side, Shearson piled up $316 million in earnings last year from the world-wide securities boom, contributing one-quarter of Amex's total net. In the words of Mr. Robinson, it helped Amex &quot;break mach 1,&quot; meaning the $1 billion earnings barrier.    As for Shearson's trials, some have been minor and others not so minor. Of the minor type, Mr. Robinson recently confronted a knotty problem of how best to comply with SEC and stock-exchange disclosure rules after word leaked out that the Amex board had been considering selling a minority interest in Shearson. SEC rules have a kind of &quot;damned-if-you-do and damned-if-you-don't&quot; effect on corporate disclosure -- of which more later.    A more serious difficulty is Shearson's legacy from Wall Street's &quot;insider&quot; trading scandals. Shearson once employed Dennis Levine, who pleaded guilty last June to charges, including securities fraud, that rated him a large fine and two years in jail. Shearson is being sued by Litton Industries, which claims that it had to pay more than it should have for Itek Corp. because Mr. Levine leaked news of the impending acquisition to traders, sending Itek stock up. No one knows how the case will turn out. But if an investment bank is vulnerable to a large damage claim when a juicy tidbit of news leaks out of confidential dealings with a client, it has a problem.    Yet when asked his feelings about the insider scandals at a recent coffee session with Journal editors, Mr. Robinson gave an arresting reply: &quot;All I can say is, thank God for the SEC.&quot; His point was that it is a good thing for Wall Street, on balance, that the SEC and U.S. Attorney Rudolph Giuliani have captured and wrung confessions out of some securities-law violators. It shows that Wall Street's watchdogs have teeth. Thus, the securities industry can defend itself by saying the system works, and thereby may be able to fend off efforts in Congress to subject it to more draconian regulation. Mr. Robinson cites another argument he is well prepared to make as head of a company that has had a lot to do with &quot;globalizing&quot; the financial-services market. If the rules get too restrictive, he says, the securities business will go to London or Hong Kong or Tokyo. &quot;I would hate to see that happen. Wall Street is a national asset.&quot;    It's possible, however, that Mr. Robinson is too sanguine about how effective those arguments will be. Last week, Rep. John Dingell acted out one of his favorite roles -- stern father figure -- in chastising a Securities Industry Association audience in Washington. Congress's instinct, as in all things, will be to &quot;tighten&quot; the rules. It might, for example, lengthen the 20-day notice required for making a tender offer and shorten the 10-day period a buyer has before being required to announce publicly that he has acquired 5% or more of a company's stock. What Congress probably will not consider in any adequate way is that those very rules have made it lucrative to traffic in information about prospective mergers, acquisitions and hostile-takeover attempts. They have, for example, created an incentive for takeover specialists to quietly line up allies among arbitrageurs to help acquire a large position in a takeover target before being forced by the rules to publicly disclose intentions.    What Congress seems bent on doing has little to do with reducing the incentive for insider trading. Rather it has to do with making it more difficult for a would-be acquirer to take a position in a company before tipping his hand. That will get wide support from corporate management, which has an understandable interest in making it difficult to take over a company that doesn't want to be taken over. A far better approach would be to require tender offers at some level of seriousness to be made available to all shareholders and to require as well that all serious takeover offers be submitted to shareholder vote.    Mr. Robinson would like to see greater efforts at self-regulation on Wall Street, perhaps through some council of heads of securities firms. &quot;Everyone would say that would be putting the fox in charge of the chicken coop,&quot; he says. &quot;But foxes know how to catch other foxes.&quot; He thinks that securities firms, if they really try, can set up internal procedures that will effectively guard against misuse of material and secret information.    The trick is to keep secrets held by investment-banking divisions, which advise corporations on takeovers, from leaking to traders and arbitrageurs in the same or other firms. Information barriers to prevent such things are referred to as &quot;Chinese walls&quot; and Mr. Robinson thinks they can be made to work. Rep. Dingell, among others, is skeptical. &quot;Chinese walls did not keep the Mongols out of China and they are not serving you well either,&quot; he told the SIA audience.    Mr. Robinson's own recent experiences suggest that it isn't always easy to abide by the SEC's rules even when you are trying. The story about discussions by the Amex board of selling an interest in Shearson appeared in the New York Times Friday, Feb. 27, quoting &quot;sources close to the company.&quot; Amex fended off reporters with &quot;no comment&quot; on Friday and Mr. Robinson huddled with his lawyers over the weekend to try to figure out a more satisfactory solution.    The lawyers cited the 1984 &quot;Carnation&quot; case, in which a Carnation Co. official who was not privy to discussions that led to Carnation's takeover by Nestle publicly denied that the company was engaged in discussions with anyone. The SEC said that in future cases any company issuing a statement of that sort must not only speak truthfully but include all material facts necessary to prevent the statement from being misleading.    The effect is that a company is safe to say &quot;no comment.&quot; But if it says something material, it had better give a complete enough description so as not to be misleading. Mr. Robinson chose the second course, putting out a statement on Sunday that confirmed that the board had indeed been discussing strategic options that included selling a minority interest in Shearson. No decision had been reached, he added.    In one sense, the Carnation rule, with its strictures against misleading statements, serves the cause of maximum disclosure. On the other hand, some executives faced with the choice of either saying nothing or taking a chance on saying something that might later be construed as misleading choose to say nothing.    Mr. Robinson's interest in having vigilant watchdogs for the securities markets is widely shared, of course. The whole point of securities law and the rules of exchanges is to assure the broad public that the markets are &quot;fair.&quot; All players benefit from soundly based public confidence. But achieving &quot;fairness&quot; in securities markets, as in anything else, is fraught with complexity. The joys and trials of owning Shearson are evidence of that truth. </TEXT></DOC>
