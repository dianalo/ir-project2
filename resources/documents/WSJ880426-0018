Akers, chairman and chief executive officer, told the annual meeting, showing more optimism than the company had expressed previously.    &quot;The fundamental improvement of the IBM company, which began in the third quarter of 1987, continued through the first quarter of 1988,&quot; Mr. Akers said. &quot;That shows that the changes we've been making have begun to take hold.&quot;    The Armonk, N.Y.-based computer giant went through an extensive early-retirement program in the past year and a half, and it reorganized operations to cut overhead and move more people into revenue-producing jobs, but the results had been slow to appear. Mr. Akers remained cautious yesterday, noting that the computer industry has been volatile and that competition remains tough. But he sounded more confident than in the past and used the word &quot;turnaround&quot; in public for the first time. He noted that profit rose in the 1987 third and fourth quarters from the year-earlier periods and that IBM had a strong first quarter, following lower earnings for the full years 1985 and 1986 and the first two quarters of 1987.    In answer to a shareholder's question, Mr. Akers said executives of MCI Communications Corp. would buy back IBM's holdings in MCI over the &quot;next several years.&quot; IBM holds about 16% of Washington-based MCI, a long-distance telecommunications company. MCI last month indicated it would buy back the stake, so Mr. Akers's comments were no surprise.    In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, IBM shares closed at $113.875, up 12.5 cents.    Much of the meeting was taken up by discussion of a shareholder resolution that would have forced a halt to sales of IBM products in South Africa. IBM has sold its South African assets, but an independent company composed largely of former IBM employees continues to sell IBM products there. The shareholder resolution, sponsored by some IBM employees and church groups, got twice the percentage of votes it received at last year's meeting but still received only 9.9% of the votes cast. </TEXT></DOC>
