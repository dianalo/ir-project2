The wife of jailed evangelist Jim Bakker urged about 100 peopleat a Sunday service to be ``faithful in your tithings,'' suggestingGod is more likely to answer the prayers of those to contribute totheir churches.   ``That is what God can do for you if you are faithful to him,''she said.   Mrs. Bakker said next week's services might be held in therented space in the Shoppers World mall, even though mall ownerStewart Gilman is demanding she move out.   Sunday night, an angry Gilman threatened legal action.   ``I'm disgusted,'' he said. ``You cannot have someone stay in aproperty indefinitely.''   He refused to reveal financial details of the dispute.   Tammy Bakker asked the congregation to help the ministry find anew site to lease _ preferably for no more than $5 per square foot.   ``We are going to try to move out of here as quickly aspossible,'' she said. ``But unless you hear differently, we'll behere next Sunday.''   Bakker, who was convicted Oct. 5 of federal fraud and conspiracycharges for diverting money invested in enterprises connected withhis PTL television ministry, is serving a 45-year sentence at theFederal Medical Center in Rochester, Minn.</TEXT></DOC>
