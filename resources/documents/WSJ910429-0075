While many states allow spouses to make claims forso-called loss of consortium, which involves intangibles suchas a loss of companionship or affection, only recently haveany courts extended similar rights to children when a parentis seriously injured.</LP><TEXT>   During the past year, the highest courts in Texas, WestVirginia and Wyoming have endorsed such suits. While thecourts acknowledge that the majority of states still opposethe suits, they say the loss of a parent's love and guidancehas serious consequences for a child's development and thatthe parental relationship merits the same kind of legalprotection as a spousal one. Eight other states, includingAlaska, Iowa, and Michigan, have also recognized &quot;parentalconsortium&quot; claims in recent years, as noted in a recentarticle in Lawyers Alert, a Boston legal publication, andseveral court decisions.   The movement by the courts could prove costly for cityagencies, manufacturers and others that frequently facepersonal-injury suits, and defense lawyers say they areconsidering asking state legislatures to bar such children'ssuits. They contend that the recent court rulings will raiseinsurance premiums and make it more difficult to settleclaims. And they speculate that courts may extend their legaltheories further to allow siblings, grandparents and otherfamily members who enjoy close relationships to file damageclaims as well.   &quot;Drawing the line at the parent-child relationship isartificial. Other relationships can be just as meaningful andclose,&quot; says John Venzke, a Houston lawyer who representedthe defendant in the Texas Supreme Court case.   In the Texas case, a jury awarded 11-year-old Julia Reagan$200,000 after her father was struck with a baseball batduring a bar brawl and suffered a severe brain injury. Thestate's high court, in upholding the award, ruled that allchildren -- regardless of whether they are minors or adultsat the time of a parent's injury -- may seek compensation forloss of guidance and care. In other states, only Arizona andWashington have allowed adult children to seek suchcompensation.   As early as the 17th century, courts recognized a master'sright to recover for economic losses stemming from aservant's injury. The same principle was later extended toallow a husband to recover for the loss of his wife'sservices.   Nonetheless, the law has traditionally restricted people'sability to recover for injuries to personal relationships. Itwasn't until recently that societal changes prompted courtsto give greater recognition to a plaintiff's emotionalsuffering. The majority of states now allow spouses, childrenand parents to recover for emotional losses in wrongful-deathcases.   Most courts that have allowed parental loss-of-consortiumclaims in non-fatal cases have ruled that compensation isonly available if the injury is serious and permanent. Butdefense lawyers say none of the courts have specificallydefined what makes an injury serious.   Stephanie L. Belcher, an 18-year-old residing at home,filed suit after her mother was injured in a head-on caraccident. Last December, the West Virginia Supreme Courtrejected her claim because she is an adult but for the firsttime recognized the right of minors and handicapped children,including adults, to seek damages.   &quot;It's clear that a parent who is a paraplegic or in a comais seriously injured, but it's not always black and white. Abad back could be considered a serious and permanent injury,and we will have to litigate those gray areas every time,&quot;says Joseph M. Sanders, Jr., a Bluefield, W.Va., lawyer forthe driver of the car that hit Ms. Belcher's mother.   Plaintiffs' lawyers say such fears are exaggerated. Theysay juries will be allowed to take into account the child'sage, the nature of the relationship with the parent and, insome instances, whether the child has other closerelationships in determining the extent of damages.   William Fred Hagans, a Houston plaintiffs' lawyer whorepresented Julia Reagan, said there are compelling policyreasons to allow children to sue when a parent is injured butnot killed. &quot;Sometimes a non-fatal injury can be worse for achild,&quot; he said. &quot;The parent is still there, but therelationship is gone.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
