Two software programs,an automated capacitor control program and a distribution automationanalysis program, that have been essential to the AACE are discussed.There have been several reliability, operations, and planning benefitsassociated with the automation of the AUB system which are describedunder equipment experiences. 6 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
