He deals in dirty air.   During a stint at the Environmental Protection Agency, the45-year-old Mr. Palmisano, an economist by training, helpedestablish rights to pollute the air -- rights that companiescan buy and sell. Where there was demand for these rights, hedecided, there was room for a middleman: himself. Now thisformer regulator is hoping for a frenzied market where, heargues, he can do good by doing well.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;I'm on a holy mission,&quot; Mr. Palmisano says. &quot;If I'mwrong, I'm doing something bad for the country. If I'm right,maybe I'm doing something good.&quot;   He has managed to build a business on his grasp of arcaneregulatory changes. His vehicle is AER*X, a trading andconsulting firm here that he founded in 1984 after leavingthe EPA. Although later that year he sold the company to WPLHoldings Inc. of Madison, Wis., AER*X remains the founder'sprovince and retains an entrepreneurial spirit. (Ownership ofAER*X -- which has a staff of 12 and had revenue of $1.4million last year -- is soon to pass to NaTec Resources Inc.,under an acquisition agreement announced this month.)   AER*X is bullish because pollution rights, currently athin graft on the body of environmental law, would besuddenly expanded through the landmark clean-air legislationpending in Congress. Bills before a House-Senate conferencecommittee would make these rights far more important inregulating both acid rain and smog.   The idea is to dangle the promise of profit beforecompanies that exceed government requirements for pollutioncontrol. The more the company exceeds the requirements, themore rights it accumulates, rights that others then canacquire to cover their own emissions. That's where Mr.Palmisano comes in.   Although buyers and sellers could probably find oneanother, AER*X saves them the trouble. &quot;They've got thecontacts -- they've already got the wheel turning,&quot; saysThomas Zosel, manager of pollution prevention at MinnesotaMining andamp; Manufacturing Co., which has bought rights throughAER*X.   AER*X declines to disclose the details of individual dealsit has executed. But Joshua Margolis, the company's chieftrader, cites glass-fiber makers in the Los Angeles area asamong the companies that have generated pollution rights byreducing emissions of the hydrocarbons that contribute tosmog. He says that such a company emitting 1,000 pounds a dayunder its permit could reduce its emissions to 650 pounds aday, thereby creating a credit of 350 pounds a day. Creditsare selling in the range of $500 to $3,000 for the right toemit one pound a day, he says.   Even when companies hold onto their rights for allocationamong their own operations, a more common practice so farthan selling rights, AER*X gets business. For it offersguidance in generating rights and having them certified byregulators, a complex procedural path.   Yet for AER*X, as for the regulatory concept on which ittries to capitalize, the real test lies ahead. NaTec, aHouston concern specializing in air-pollution controls,proposes to make AER*X a prominent part of its plan to helpindustry deal with regulatory change. Socrates Christopher,NaTec's chief executive, says AER*X -- of which Mr. Palmisanoremains president -- may even take positions in pollutionrights if the new regulations permit, much as a Big Boardspecialist holds stocks.   Congress is relying on pollution rights to resolve thenettlesome issue of acid rain. The clean-air legislationwould allocate rights -- in this context termed emissionallowances -- to electric utilities. Allowances for onlyabout half the utility industry's current emissions of sulfurdioxide, a pollutant linked to acid rain, would be doled out.So, overall emissions would have to be sharply reduced.   But whether any company's store of allowances met itsneeds would depend on whether it invests in additionalemission-control equipment, converts to cleaner fuels ormakes other operating changes, as well as whether it facesgrowing electricity demand. Doubtless some firms would end uplong in allowances, some short. Thus arises the need fortrades, and a new market for Mr. Palmisano to maneuver in.   Trading could also get a boost from proposals to reducesmog. Already in the smoggiest cities, companies expandingproduction need to own offsetting pollution rights if theadditional emissions of smog-creating compounds and otherpollutants cross certain quantitative thresholds. Theclean-air legislation, by lowering these thresholds, wouldintensify demand for rights, in this case called offsetcredits.   State regulators in Southern California, moreover, areahead of Washington. Under rules enacted last month, not onlysuch large operations as oil refineries but also small ones-- such as furniture factories, dry cleaners, bakers -- aremore likely to need credits if they want to expand in LosAngeles and neighboring counties.   All this portends heady possibilities for Mr. Palmisano.The changes before Congress follow a clash of ideas that hejoined in the early 1980s as a member of the EPA's regulatoryreform staff. He belonged to a faction at the agency thatthought traditional &quot;command-and-control&quot; regulation, whichspecifies smokestack-by-smokestack controls, was failing.This group argued that plant managers, goaded byprofit-seeking executives, could outdo regulators in findingways to curb emissions, and do so at less cost than undertraditional rules.   Some environmental groups, though not all, agree with thatview. Daniel Dudek, an economist at the Environmental DefenseFund, even joined Mr. Palmisano in expressing frustrationwith the slow pace at which pollution rights were gainingacceptance. The two wrote an article titled &quot;EmissionsTrading: Why Is This Thoroughbred Hobbled?&quot; Now the hobblesmay be coming off.   According to an EPA analysis, utilities in Pennsylvaniaalone could annually be selling rights valued at $147 millionby the year 2005. Others aren't so sure, given a suddenexpansion in this sort of pollution regulation. Says RobertBeck, who has been following the clean-air legislation forEdison Electric Institute, a trade group, &quot;Nobody reallyknows what will happen out there.&quot;   One uncertainty is whether companies will hoard pollutionrights, fearing to sell assets they may need later forexpansion. Another is whether the detailed regulations, whichwon't be written until the legislation clears Congress, willprove unwieldy.   But Mr. Palmisano is holding out hope for a liquid market.He talks about trading in leases and options on rights aswell as in the rights themselves. Engineering and law firmsare also likely to get a piece of the trading business. Ifeverything works out, &quot;trading will explode,&quot; Mr. Palmisanosays. &quot;There's no doubt about it. I just hope I get myshare.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
