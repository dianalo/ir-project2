DOYLE</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   An alleged divorce-fixing scheme involving formerMiss America Bess Myerson struck at ``the firmest pillar of goodgovernment,'' a prosecutor said as four days of closing argumentsended.   After hearing defense and prosecution lawyers finish theirsummations on Friday, U.S. District Judge John F. Keenan said hewould turn the case over to the jury after instructing them on thelaw. The panel should get the case Monday afternoon.   Miss Myerson, Miss America in 1945 and once New York City'scultural affairs commissioner, is accused of trying to influence ajudge's rulings in the divorce of her lover, Carl ``Andy'' Capasso.   According to prosecutors, former state Supreme Court JusticeHortense Gabel slashed Capasso's weekly support payments to hisestranged wife weeks after Miss Myerson gave a $19,000-a-year cityjob to the judge's daughter, Sukhreet Gabel, in August 1983.   Miss Myerson, 64, Capasso, 43, and Mrs. Gabel, who turned 76Friday, are all charged with plotting to fix the divorce and thencover up the scheme.   In addition, Miss Myerson is charged with obstruction of justice.She faces a maximum 30 years in prison and $513,000 in fines ifconvicted on all counts. Her co-defendants face up to 25 years and$263,000 if convicted.   Assistant U.S. Attorney Stuart Abrams noted that carved on thefacade of the court building where the Capasso divorce proceedingswere conducted are the words: ``The true administration of justiceis the firmest pillar of good government.   ``The scheme in this case, ladies and gentlemen, struck at thatpillar.''   Previously, Myerson attorney Frederick Hafetz derided theprosecution case as ``a soap opera, not a criminal trial.''   But Abrams maintained: ``This is not a soap opera. It's a crime.''   Most of the government case was based on circumstantial evidencebecause neither an eyewitness to the alleged bribe plot nor taperecording of it existed.   The main prosecution witness, Sukhreet Gabel, testified thatafter a grand jury began an investigation in 1986, Miss Myersonurged her ``to keep your mouth shut'' because ``you could bedangerous.''   But on cross-examination, Ms. Gabel admitted her trial testimonydiffered from what she had told investigators and the grand jury onseveral occasions.   Hafetz, who got Ms. Gabel to admit that electroshock treatmentsfor depression had left her memory like ``Swiss cheese,'' told thejury that ``she's a walking definition of reasonable doubt.''   To convict on any of the charges, jurors must find the governmentproved its case beyond a reasonable doubt.</TEXT></DOC>
