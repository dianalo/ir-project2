Large optically homogeneous Tl(InS/sub 2/)/sub 1-x/(FeSe/sub2/)/sub x/ single crystals with x = 0, 0.001, 0.005, 0.01, 0.015 wereprepared and the IR reflection spectra were measured for studying theeffect of In reversible Fe and S reversible Se partial double substitutionon the phonon spectrum and on T/sub c/. The IR reflection spectra, dielectricloss function spectra and apparent permittivity spectra obtained at differenttemperatures in the range 84 to 300 K are shown and the anomaly in T/subc/ and in vibrational band parameter is explained.</TEXT></DOC>
