I'm getting used to it. He's realhappy,'' she said as she prepared to fly home to Massachusetts today.   Medeiros gave Travis up for adoption nine months ago in hopes hisnew parents would provide the security and comforts she feared shecouldn't after her boyfriend left her. At 17, she felt it was theright thing to do.   But that decision was turned upside down last month, when Travis'adoptive parents, William and Tasia Stephens, were shot to death afew feet from the baby's crib at their home in Novato, about 25miles north of San Francisco.   The Stephenses' housekeeper and her boyfriend were arraignedWednesday on charges of murder and pleaded innocent. Yolanda Seguraand Zohelin Diaz, both 25-year-old illegal aliens from Guatemala,face a possible death sentence if convicted. A preliminary hearingwas set for April 5.   Novato police believe the shooting occurred after Segura told herboyfriend she had been sexually assaulted at the home of the slaincouple, the San Francisco Chronicle reported today.   Segura, however, may have been fired by the couple andinvestigators think she may have told Diaz the story to cover up theloss of the job, the newspaper reported without citing sources.   On Tuesday, Superior Court Juvenile Commissioner Sylvia Shapiroruled that the adoption, arranged before Travis' birth, had not beenlegally finalized, thereby paving the way for Medeiros to returnwith the baby to her mother's home in Billerica, Mass.   ``Now I know I'm ready. I've grown up a lot,'' Medeiros, 18, saidafterward.   Shapiro required Medeiros to take parenting classes and makemonthly reports to the court about the child's welfare. The reportswill be shared with relatives of the slain couple, who also appliedfor custody of the child, and the case will be reviewed in sixmonths.   But Medeiros isn't worried about that now.   ``I just care about my son,'' she said. ``Nothing else bothersme. I'm going to do what's best for him.''</TEXT></DOC>
