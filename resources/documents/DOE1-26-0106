The model consisted of a polyethylenechain with 400 CH{sub 2} units placed on a polymer surface. A laser excitationwas simulated by giving a small portion of the polymer chain a nonequilibriummomentum distribution. The excitation energy threshold for fragmentationof the polymers was found to be quite large, owing to the tendency ofthe system to transfer large amounts of vibrational energy along thechain. 7 refs., 4 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
