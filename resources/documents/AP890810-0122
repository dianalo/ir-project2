Hezbollah, the pro-Iranian group believed to sponsorhostage-holders, took responsibility for the suicide truck bombingWednesday, which wounded five Israeli soldiers and a member of theallied South Lebanon Army militia.   Sheik Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah, spiritual adviser ofHezbollah, called it a ``down payment'' of retaliation for Israel'sabduction July 28 of Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid, a Shiite clericaffiliated with the organization.   ``Much more will follow,'' Fadlallah said. Hezbollah, whose namemeans Party of God, said the explosives-laden pickup was driven bya 24-year-old Shiite clergyman.   A U.N. source, speaking anonymously, said the predominantlyChristian militia was conducting house-to-house roundups in Iblel-Saqi and Rashaya villages in the ``security zone'' Israelmaintains just north of its border.   ``The SLA militiamen threw hand grenades at the Norwegiansoldiers manning a checkpoint there,'' he said.   Timur Goksel, spokesman for the peacekeepers, said grenades weredrawn but not thrown. He said the two Norwegians were injuredWednesday, by flying stones, when militiamen fired at their legs.   When 15 to 20 militiamen were refused passage through a U.N.checkpoint, Goksel said, ``They put a gun at a man's head and thenthey pulled out hand grenades. Then they began firing at the groundand the soldier's legs.''   He said the second incident was similar.   Another U.N. official said privately the U.N. command told theIsraeli army ``they control these guys and they should exercisemore of that control before somebody gets killed.''   An Iranian newspaper said Thursday indirect talks between Iranand the United States on the hostage situation would begin withindays.   Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency quoted theEnglish-language Tehran Times, which is close to President HashemiRafsanjani, as saying talks would be conducted through a thirdcountry, probably Pakistan.   Later Thursday, however, the agency issued a dispatch sayingreports of talks with the United States were ``suspicious'' andquoted sources as saying none were being held.   It quoted one unidentified source as saying the United Stateshad sent messages ``through certain third governments,'' but theywere rejected because some had an ``insolent tone.''   In Washington, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said itwas ``premature'' to expect direct talks with Tehran and ``we'renowhere near that,'' but indicated indirect contacts would continue.   Sixteen Western hostages are held in Lebanon, including eightAmericans. Israel has offered to trade Obeid and the estimated300-400 other Shiites it holds for three Israeli soldiers held inLebanon and all the hostages.   President Bush said Wednesday he would pursue every diplomaticchannel, but would not engage in ``trading off or negotiating.''   In Jerusalem, an aide to Yitzhak Shamir said Bush and theIsraeli prime minister had agreed to coordinate their efforts tofree foreign hostages and Israeli prisoners.   Avi Pazner said the decision was reached in a 10-minutetelephone call Wednesday from Shamir to Bush. Pazner's office saidBush did not mention the Obeid abuction, which the United Stateshas criticized.   Fitzwater said: ``We've generally tried to be forthcoming withwhat we are doing, and they have been forthcoming wth what they'redoing. However, I would not characterize it as coordination.''   In a statement released Thursday, Bush said: ``This Sundaymillions of Americans of every faith will attend worship services.... I ask that each of you say a special prayer ... for theAmerican hostages being held in Lebanon.''   Ash-Shiraa, a Beirut weekly, quoted ``non-Arab'' sources assaying armed women were moving the hostages to new hideouts inBeirut and its suburbs. The paper said the women, dressed in longblack chadors, worked at night, carrying automatic weapons to beused only under ``utmost necessity.''   Its report could not be verified independently. Ash-Shiraagained recognition in November 1986 with the first story about theIran-Contra deal to exchange U.S. arms for hostages. Its recentreporting on the hostages has not been accurate.   The South Lebanon Army radio Voice of the South said themilitiamen rounded up several young Shiite men. It said most of thearrests were made in Khiyam village, where about 50,000 Shiiteslive.   Khiyam also is in the buffer zone, an area 6 to 10 miles deeppatrolled by Israel soldiers and the surrogate militia.   Uri Lubrani, Israel's coordinator for south Lebanon, saidWednesday the Israelis would retaliate for the attack on theconvoy, but did not say where or when.   A statement from the SLA militia command said, withoutelaborating, that gateways to the ``security zone'' from the restof Lebanon would be closed until Sunday. A south Lebanon securitysource said the SLA wanted to ``prevent possible collaborators withthe suicide bomber from leaving the zone.''   Police said Hezbollah was abandoning regular bases as aprecaution against Israeli air strikes.   A police spokesman said small groups of Hezbollah fighters,carrying shoulder-fired SAM-7 missiles, were seen overnight movinginto wooded mountain slopes that surround the Syrian-occupied BekaaValley in eastern Lebanon.   In south Beirut, he said, Hezbollah had moved into a ``chain ofbasements and underground shelters.''   Hezbollah has refused to negotiate a prisoner exchange withIsrael. It said the West should force Israel to free Obeid, anddescribed Israel's claims about statements the cleric made underinterrogation as ``false and misleading.''   Israeli officials have said Obeid confessed to helping planattacks on Israel and the abduction Feb. 17, 1988, of Lt. Col.William Higgins while he was on U.N. duty in south Lebanon.   Higgins' captors said July 31 they had hanged the U.S. Marineofficer in retaliation for Obeid's abduction, but the question ofwhen he died remains unresolved. Some reports say he was killedlast year.</TEXT></DOC>
