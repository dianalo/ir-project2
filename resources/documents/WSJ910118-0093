Most of the seniors were born in 1973, when the U.S. waswithdrawing from Vietnam, and have no memory of war otherthan some of its most painful consequences: the scars left onfathers and uncles who served in Vietnam.</LP><TEXT>   And they are young -- these incoming college students,these front-line candidates for any military draft, thesecitizens on the verge of voting age. Yet they are old enoughto have friends at risk in the conflict, and to face thatrisk themselves.   Tiffany Blake, for one. Her prom date from last spring isat war in the Gulf.   &quot;I really don't think I'm mature enough for war, let alonehim,&quot; she says. &quot;He's goofy. He's really not ready for war.&quot;   Neither, says Lolitta Hall, is her former boyfriend, alsoserving in the Gulf. Lolitta was watching &quot;Three's Company&quot;reruns when the first report was broadcast that bombs werefalling on Baghdad. She wept then, and again yesterdaymorning at school.   &quot;Dewayne wouldn't hurt a fly,&quot; she says, her earringsdangling nearly to her shoulders. &quot;He's sweet and gentle. Ican't imagine him picking up a gun.&quot;   Karen Wells issues a warning. &quot;I think your boyfriends aregoing to come back real, real different,&quot; she says. Tiffanyknows what that could mean. &quot;I hope they don't come back asmessed up as my uncle did from Vietnam.&quot;   Kisha Chittams, wearing a Bart Simpson sweatshirt under aBowie High jacket, listens intently. Last October, all shewanted was money for college. She enlisted in the Army, andunless the war is over she will depart for the Gulf on July11.   Sure, she has been aware of all the trouble in the Gulf,but it never hit home. It wasn't real. &quot;I didn't really thinkmuch would come of it. I thought, you know, they'll beplaying childish games, and then it'll be over.&quot;   Now, she says in a shaky voice, &quot;I'm really scared. I prayevery night that this will be over with when July comes. Idon't want to go. I do not want to go. I really don't.&quot;   Tuesday night Kisha came home from a school wrestling meetand saw President Bush on the television screen. &quot;I turned itoff. I guess I just didn't want to hear it,&quot; she says.   While Kisha tried to block out the war, Andy Donder talkedabout it for four hours with his father, who spent 18 monthsas a Marine sergeant in Vietnam. &quot;My father was just sittingthere smiling. He said, `I know what it's like to be part ofa good offensive.'&quot;   But most of these teen-agers took little solace in theU.S.'s apparent triumph in the first night of bombing. Unlikeearlier generations, they have never taken for granted thatAmerica is invincible. &quot;I think the worst is yet to come,&quot;says Keith Lively, a curly haired 17-year-old. &quot;I definitelythink he's {Saddam Hussein} got more than we're seeing.&quot;   &quot;He has something up his sleeve,&quot; worries Tiffany.   The reality of war has unified these students aroundapprehension. But on a blustery morning earlier in the week,as the clock ticked toward the United Nation's Jan. 15deadline for Iraq to pull out of Kuwait, they were sharplydivided over the prospect of war.   &quot;That area has 50% to 60% of the world's known oilreserves. It's too vital an area for U.S. interests --everything runs on gasoline and oil. We can't ignore thesituation there. So I think we're going to have to act,&quot;argued Colin Edwards, a clean-cut 17-year-old in a brightyellow pullover sweater. He concluded: &quot;I'm personally foropening up with nuclear weapons, that sort of thing, tominimize U.S. casualties.&quot;   Paul Jacovus, the intense editor of the school newspaper,disagreed. &quot;I do not think we belong in their territorialdisputes,&quot; he declared. &quot;This is not a just war for America.I would not want to die in this war.&quot;   But like much of the nation yesterday, many students laidaside their objections and resolved to quietly support thepresident's decision to fight.   Alison Price, a 17-year-old with a long strawberry blondbraid, had already made a gesture to the troops even thoughshe doesn't believe the U.S. should be in the Gulf. Lastmonth she sent a Christmas card to the troops.   &quot;Regardless how you feel about the war, you still have tosupport the troops over there,&quot; Alison says.   Her card &quot;was just a general `Dear Guys,'&quot; she explains.On it she wrote, &quot;We're supporting you, we're praying for youand hoping things will go OK over there.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
