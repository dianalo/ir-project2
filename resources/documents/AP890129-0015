(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Dick Frymire's renowned rooster Teddisgraced himself on national television when he predictedCincinnati to win the Super Bowl. But he's not quitting and shouldhave his picks for top 10 TV shows ready soon.   ``I tell everybody that Ted is the most famous unfried chicken inthe world today,'' says Frymire, who has a regional radio showtelling yarns about Ted and offering folklore and advice oneverything from getting rid of roaches and squirrels to calming acrying baby.   For the TV picks, Frymire will put the names of about 50 shows infront of Ted and place a kernel of corn in front of each sign. Thefirst grain of corn Ted eats will be his choice of the No. 1 show,with picks up to 10.   Maybe that'll work out better than his Superbowl prediction,which was made on national television, on CBS' ``Sunday Morning.''   It all started in 1984 when Frymire put his pet into a pen shadedwith two old campaign posters, one of Ronald Reagan and the other ofWalter Mondale. He set out some numbers and corn kernels, and askedTed how many states Mondale would carry in the election.   Ted ate the kernel in front of the number ``1.''   ``I'm the biggest Democrat that ever was,'' Frymire said. ``And Ithought, `The chicken's gone Republican on me for sure.'''   Since then, Ted has predicted winners of basketball games, theKentucky Derby and three Super Bowl games.</TEXT><DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   After 18 years of catering to jet-settingsocialites, the exclusive Faces discotheque on the Rush Street nightlife strip near downtown has gone out with a bang.   Owner George Shales threw a last-look party for the club's 16,000card-carrying members Friday night, and invited the public.   Jim Kurianowicz, 42, who worked as a bartender there, lamentedchanges he said helped lead to the closing of Faces.   ``When it opened, Rush Street was like Vegas,'' Kurianowicz said.``Now, the landmarks are gone. It's all executives, high-rises andyuppies.''   And the rent has gone from $2,500 a month to $14,000, Shales said.   Customers during the early days became lifetime members for $50,when video monitors flashed scenes from ``Charlie's Angels,'' andthe singles crowd rocked to quadrophonic sound.   ``I used to come here when I was a bachelor. I knew all thedances then, the hustle, the bump. I was pretty good,'' said LoganDugaw, of suburban LaGrange. He's now 45, and has five children.</TEXT><DATELINE>POWHATAN, Ark. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   They only had a week to do it, but an armyof offspring was enough to build a new house for 86-year-old EvanSmith, replacing his fire-damaged homestead.   His old house burned Jan. 7. He moved in with a daughter,Patricia Smith, but yearned for a place of his own, she said.   So his son, Jerry Smith, who is in the construction business inPiedmont, S.C., proposed using his dad's insurance proceeds to builda new house during his one-week vacation.   ``I personally didn't think we could do it, but we did,'' Ms.Smith said Saturday from this northeastern Arkansas town of 49residents.   ``With all of us together, we have the ability,'' Jerry Smithsaid.   The construction crew consisted of ``grandkids andgreat-grandkids and brothers-in-law and sisters-in-law,'' Ms. Smithsaid.   ``We had everybody's cooperation _ we had to, to get this alldone in this length of time. We have really pitched in. When westarted, oh, Lord, we had 25 folks out there helping,'' she said.``It is a labor of love. I don't know what else you'd call it.''</TEXT></DOC>
