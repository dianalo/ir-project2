Western Canada is endowed with very large quantitiesof heavy oil, most of it occuring as crude bitumen. The production ofconventional heavy oil is projected to decline to 150,000 barrels a dayby 2000. Crude bitumen production could increase to nearly 450,000 barrelsa day over the same period, depending on oil prices and market availability.On a social basis, allowing for a 10 percent real return, the supplycost at the field of in-situ bitumen production currently in the rangeof $10 (US) a barrel, can be as low as $8 (US) a barrel for the betterquality deposits. With field upgrading, total supply costs at the upgradersite would rang for $18 (US) to $26 (US) a barrel. The social supplycost of new integrated oil sands mining plants is estimated at between$21 (US) and $31 (US) a barrel at the plant gate. Heavy oil exports couldreach 500,000 to 600,000 barrels a day, provided markets can be developed.Pipeline capacity is not considered an insurmountable constraint on exportlevels; diluent availability could be a problem. 1 fig., 2 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
