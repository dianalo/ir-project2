A spokesman for the Air Force's electronic system divisionsaid the termination wouldn't affect the Saudi government'sability to protect itself from Iraqi airplanes because theSaudis already have sophisticated air defenses. Peace Shield,long plagued by software problems, is years behind schedule.</LP><TEXT>   The move is another in a string of setbacks for Boeing'sunprofitable military operations. The Army, concerned aboutescalating costs, just last month canceled the fiber-opticguided missile, or FOG-M, which was being developed by Boeingand General Motors Corp.'s Hughes Aircraft unit.   The cancellation also follows the Defense Department'stermination this week of the A-12 attack plane, built byMcDonnell Douglas Corp. and General Dynamics Corp. Manyanalysts interpreted that move as a sign the Pentagon is nowtaking a get-tough stance with all its contractors.   Boeing said it was &quot;disappointed&quot; in the Air Force action,adding that because the government changed its requirementsin midstream, the company believes it isn't in default of thePeace Shield accord and will &quot;pursue all available legal oradministrative remedies.&quot;   &quot;In our view, the government's action is neither legallysustainable nor in the best interests of either the U.S. orthe Saudi Arabian governments,&quot; Boeing said in a statement.&quot;We believe that no other contractor will be able to completethis complex program without substantial further scheduledelays and cost increases.&quot;   It said about 400 employees will be affected by thispartial termination and an &quot;orderly transition&quot; to otherassignments is expected.   The Air Force didn't estimate the value of the portion ofthe contract that was being scrapped, but a Boeing spokesmansaid it was &quot;the major part of it.&quot;   Boeing, however, will continue to install and maintainradar sites and support the Airborne Warning and ControlSystem, or AWACS, surveillance planes that are linkedtogether as part of the computerized Peace Shield network.   The Air Force, which earlier had withheld $240 million inpayments from Boeing on Peace Shield, said it was terminatingthe company's contract because it had fallen so far behindschedule in developing the system. Peace Shield was awardedto Boeing in February 1985 and was to be completed in April1991. The Air Force said that it had extended Boeing'scontract once by almost a year but that the company failed tocomplete testing on time and wouldn't be able to finish thecontract until August 1994.   Earlier this week, Boeing confirmed that the Bushadministration has put on hold its request for a secondmultibillion dollar arms package with Saudi Arabia, hurtingthe company's chances that it can find additional businessfor the AWACS line, which is slated to end this spring.   In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchangeyesterday, Boeing rose $1.25 to $45.</TEXT></DOC>
