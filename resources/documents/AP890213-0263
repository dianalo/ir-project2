On other markets, crude oil futures climbed higher despiterumblings of increased production by both Iran and the United ArabEmirates; grain and soybean futures prices slipped lower afterfavorable weather swept the South American growing regions ofArgentina and Brazil over the weekend; and gold dipped slightly astraders anticipated the Federal Reserve Board might nudge interestrates higher to fight inflation.   On Monday, copper futures settled 1.6 cents to 5.45 cents loweron the New York Commodity Exchange, with the contract for deliveryin March at $1.2825 a pound.   The spot March contract for copper futures peaked at $1.5190 apound nearly four weeks ago and has declined steadily since assupply tightness has eased and labor problems in the key producingnations of Chile and Peru have been resolved.   ``Any time inventories rise, it's bad news. But the trade waslooking for a rise in stocks of between 1,000 and 3,000 tons at theLME, and what they saw was somewhere in the neighborhood of 7,300instead,'' said John O'Connell of Refco Inc. ``That put somedownside pressure on the market.''   Crude oil futures rose in the wake of a big decline late lastweek, but traders said there was little news to explain the runup.   ``There's really no news and the vague blurbs we did here _ thatIran was increasing production, that the UAE would be above quotanext month _ both were actually bearish,'' said Jim Ritterbusch,vice president-trading and research for Carson Petroleum Co. inChicago.   ``I think most of the buying today might have come because themarket didn't break,'' he said. ``And it points up that we're in achoppy, sideways market, casting around for some real news.''   Crude oil settled 21 cents to 48 cents higher on the New YorkMercantile Exchange, with March at $17.59 a barrel; heating oil was.81 cent to .86 cent higher, with March at 48.17 cents a gallon; andunleaded gasoline was unchanged to .58 cent higher, with March at48.15 cents a gallon.   Grain and soybean futures prices came under pressure from theopening bell at the Chicago Board of Trade and never recovered. DaleGustafson of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., Chicago said reports ofrain in South America helped depress prices.   Without any significant export business announcements, prices inthe wheat and corn pits slid lower in sympathy.   Wheat settled 2 cents to 4 cents lower, with the contract fordelivery in March at $4.25\ a bushel; corn was } cent to 1\ centslower, with March at $2.65\ a bushel; oats were 1\ cents to 2} centslower, with March at $2.04\ a bushel; and soybeans were 7 cent to 12cents lower, with March at $7.24 a bushel.
