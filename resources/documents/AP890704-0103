Strikers in Dhaka, the capital, damaged 10 vehicles and at least30 strikers were injured in clashes with police, said AbdulMutallib, president of the Bangladesh Workers' Federation.   In Mymensingh, 70 miles north of Dhaka, workers blocked railtracks and halted train traffic, said government official Nurul Huq.   More than 20 trade unions backed by opposition political partiesjoined in calling the 24-hour general strike. The unions representBandladesh's 1.5 million industrial and railroad workers and demandthe government nearly double the minimum wage from the equivalent of$25 a month to $44. They also want allowances pegged to the cost ofliving and set at 60 percent of their wages.   Most industrial workers are employed at textile, jute and carpetmanufacturing mills and factories.   United News of Bangladesh news agency reported the strikeseverely disrupted train, bus and ferry services all over thecountry.   Trade union leaders in Chittagong and Khulna ports, contacted bytelephone, said striking dock workers formed picket lines and haltedwork there.   In Dhaka, a normally bustling city of 4 million people, busesstayed off the road and motorists did not venture out for fear ofviolence.   But the city's bicycle-rickshaws were out in force, transportingcommuters to offices. Rickshaws were exempted from the strike.   Police officials said more than 200 youths were taken intocustody Monday night and early Tuesday. ``The boys have been pickedup on suspicion that they may carry out violence,'' a policeofficial said. ``They will be released after the strike is over.''</TEXT></DOC>
