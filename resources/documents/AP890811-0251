TWA, owned by takeover specialist Carl Icahn, said itssecond-quarter loss compared with a net profit of $97.2 million inthe same period in 1988.   The year-earlier results include a one-time gain from litigationbetween TWA and the estate of the late Howard Hughes, a previousowner. The results for the latest quarter do not include about $87million in unrealized gains from TWA's investment portfolio, thecompany said.   The latest loss occurred despite a 5.7 percent increase insecond-quarter revenue to $1.20 billion from $1.14 billion.   Late last week, TWA suspended contract talks with the Machinistsunion because of the possibility of a merger or change inmanagement at the airline, union officials said.   TWA, the nation's sixth-largest airline, confirmed that thetalks had been halted, but refused to say why. Icahn had previouslyexpressed interest in buying strikebound Eastern Airlines and hadbeen in extensive talks with that carrier's unions. His interestrecently has shifted to other possible combinations, according toMachinists union officials.   For the first half of the year, TWA posted a net loss of $87.4million, compared with a net profit of $44.7 million in the sameperiod of 1988.   First-half revenue rose 6.5 percent to $2.19 billion from $2.06billion.</TEXT></DOC>
