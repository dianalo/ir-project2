By a vote of 312-105, the House voted to adopt a spending planthat slashes nearly $2 billion for Star Wars from the president'srequest. strictly limits the B-2 stealth bomber program and makesdrastic cuts in the MX and Midgetman nuclear missiles.   Despite the unusually rapid approval of the costly bill by theDemocratic-controlled House, the ranking Republican on the HouseArmed Services Committee, Rep. William Dickinson of Alabama, saidBush may veto the measure.   And in advance of the vote, the White House budget office saidthe president's senior advisers would recommend a veto on groundsthe measure ``would severely compromise the administration'sobjective of providing adequate defense capabilities withinconstrained resources.''   ``They have conformed,'' Dickinson said of the appropriationsmeasure that conforms to the separate defense authorization billthe House adopted last week. ``But that still makes it veto-bait inmy opinion.''   The bill, approved as Congress rushed to complete pendingbusiness before starting a month-long recess later today, slashed$2 billion from classified programs that include the advancedfighter and advanced cruise missile.   The money bill also incorporates the cuts the House made in theStar Wars anti-missile program, the B-2 stealth bomber and the MXand Midgetman nuclear missiles in the policy-setting authorizationbill.   The House cut Bush's request of $4.9 billion for Star Wars by$1.8 billion, imposed strict limitation on production of theradar-evading B-2, trimmed $502 million from the $1.1 billionsought for the MX rail-garrison system and eliminated all $100million sought for the Midgetman.   Dickinson said he hoped that when members of the the Senate andHouse meet early in September to craft a final version of the bill,the ``most egregious add-ons and deletions can be modified andlimited to make it acceptable to the administration.''   But he said as they stand now, he does not support theauthorization and appropriations bills and would recommend thatBush veto the legislation.   ``I think it will be vetoed,'' Dickinson said.   But Rep. Ted Weiss, D-N.Y., complained about suggestions thatHouse-Senate conferees will change what the House did after thechamber ``worked its will on the defense authorization bill.''   ``That really borders on the ridiculous. The House has spoken,''Weiss said.   The bill adds $893 million to the administration's budget forthe purchase of 24 new F-14 jet fighters and 12 EA-6B Prowlers,both manufactured by Grumman Aerospace Corp.   Bush has proposed canceling the F-14D, a carrier-based fighterplane the House restored in its authorization bill. The Houseearmarked about $1 billion for 24 planes over two years.   Rep. John Murtha, D-Pa., chairman of the House Appropriationsdefense subcommittee, criticized the increasing costs of theAdvanced Tactical Fighter and favored spending money onconventional projects.   The appropriations bill is designed to provide the money for thedefense programs approved by the House last week. The measure callsfor $286.5 billion in budget authority and $281.9 billion inoutlays, but doesn't include money for the Department of Energy andmilitary construction.   The House defense authorization bill totals $305 billion _ $295billion for the Defense Department and $10 billion for militarynuclear programs handled by the Energy Department.  </TEXT></DOC>
