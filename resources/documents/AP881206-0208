The army, meanwhile, said it was opening an investigation intothe death Monday of a 15-year-old Gaza youth following allegationsshe was shot deliberately at close range by a soldier.   The girl, Asma Abu Obadah, of the Shati refugee camp in GazaCity, was hit in the back of the head with a single plastic bulleton her way home from school. The army said a patrol commander openedfire to disperse a riot, but witnesses said the girl was shot atclose range after she panicked and ran.   ``We are conducting investigations'' into the girl's death, saidan army official, who cannot be further identified under militaryrules. ``We don't have results yet and don't expect anythingtonight.''   The girl was the 319th Palestinian to die since the Palestinianslaunched their uprising against Israeli rule in the occupiedterritories on Dec. 8, 1987. Most have been shot in clashes withIsraeli troops. Eleven Israelis also have been killed.   Seven Palestinians were reported wounded in clashes in the GazaStrip, and one in the West Bank.   Among the victims in Gaza was 5-year-old Ahmed Bahassi, who wasshot in the chest in the Deir Balah refugee camp, doctors said.Doctors at Ahli Arab Hospital in Gaza City said he was ``out ofdanger'' after the bullet was removed.   The army confirmed that the 5-year-old boy was wounded.   ``In several riots, troops were attacked with stones, bricks andother objects,'' an army spokesman said. ``The commander of an armypatrol had to fire plastic bullets, aiming at the rioters' legs, inorder to disperse them.''   ``During the incident, no children were seen among the rioters.The army is checking how and when the boy was injured,'' he said.   Two teen-agers also were reported wounded by Israeli gunfire inDeir Balah, and four others were hit in stone-throwing clashes inthe Khan Yunis and Bureij refugee camps and Gaza City.   The army confirmed four casualties in Gaza.   In the West Bank, 13-year-old Anwar Bhati from the village ofShwakah was shot in the head when villagers threw stones to try toblock soldiers from entering and searching their homes, Arabreporters said.   Bhati was in guarded condition at Mukassad Hospital in Jerusalem,where he underwent brain surgery. Dr. Rustom Namari, director of thehospital, said the teen-ager was hit with a plastic bullet.   ``We cleaned the wound, but we were unable to remove the bulletbecause it was too deep,'' Namari said.   An army spokesman confirmed the Shwakah wounding and three bulletinjuries in the Gaza Strip. He said no other details were available.   The army has been using plastic bullets since last August forriot control. The bullets have drawn criticism from the U.N. Reliefand Works Agency, which oversees aid to Palestinian refugees, andforeign countries including the United States.   Plastic bullets are not supposed to be lethal if fired from adistance of 70 yards or more. But doctors say they can kill if firedat close range or if they penetrate the head, chest or spine.   The general strike was called to express solidarity with the5,600 Palestinians in Israeli jails. It was the first of threecalled this week by underground leaders of the Palestinian uprising.Shutdowns Thursday and Friday are to mark the end of one year ofPalestinian revolt.   Businesses were closed in most of the West Bank and Gaza, andpublic transportation halted. A Jewish man was hospitalized after acar he was driving was stoned near Bethlehem.   In Nablus, dozens of Palestinians were treated Monday and Tuesdayfor injuries from rubber bullets or beatings. The bullets, actuallyrubber-covered metal pellets, generally do not penetrate the skinbut can cause bruising and broken bones.   Also on Tuesday, police in Haifa said they uncovered a 10-membersquad of Israeli Arabs responsible for a grenade attack in thecoastal city last August in which 25 people were injured.   Two of those arrested were Bedouin soldiers in the Israeli army,and police said they suspect the squad planned to kidnap and killother soldiers. Bedouins and Druse are the only Arabs allowed toserve in Israel's army.</TEXT></DOC>
