(chart)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>The Dawn of MAN: A Promising Way To Connect LANsandM;Throughout the 1980s, thousands of companies brought in local area networks(LANs) as a logical way to unite personal computers, printers and otherdevices throughout work groups or entire buildings.andP;  now that the LANs are inplace, users are calling for connectivity between LANs in other buildings oreven across town.andP;  Dedicated T1 lines, Ethernet backbones and other maturetechnologies can handle the job, but at what price?andM;The public network providers believe there's a better way.andP;  Soon they will bespreading the word that the communications revolution is about to enteranother era.andP;  Welcome to the dawn of MAN--a new technology and acronym thatstands for Metropolitan Area Network.andM;The measure of the MAN in this case is currently being defined by theInstitute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc. (IEEE).andP;  The standardsbody's 802.6 subcommittee on MANs expects to have a standard out this year.andO;In order to meet this standard, technology must provide a high-speed, 40 to50 megabits per second switched data-networking service within at least a50-mile range.andP;  Two MAN Developers, ATandamp;T and QPSX Communications Ltd. ofPerth, Australia, are already marketing technology to public networkproviders.andM;The Early MarketsandM;The service will be targeted initially at LAN-to-LAN and LAN-to-LAN (widearea network) connections.andP;  Because MANs offer high-speed communications andcan transmit high-resolution images reliably, new applications are opening inmedical and scientific research.andP;  The technology can also handle voice andvideo transmission, although these applications will not be offeredinitially.andM;Analysts, developers of the service and potential users see MANs as a moreimmediate precursor to broadband Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN)offerings and predict that MANs will become a prime mover toward broadbandISDN.andP;  With widespread ISDN implementation at least five or six years away,MANs make sense today for those needing to extend LAN power beyond a buildingor campus environment.andM;&quot;People are anxious to derive the benefits of high-speed data transfer beyondlocal area networks, and the impact on users will be tremendous,&quot; predictsArthur Papacostas, the director of measurement and research at Philadelphia'sTemple University.andP;  Temple is scheduled to become the first U.S.andO;organization to enter the age of MANs later this year, when the universityand Bell Atlantic Corp. conduct a field trial of 802.6 MAN technology (seesidebar, &quot;Temple's Big MAN on Campus&quot;).andP;  The technology is already in use inAustralia, where QPSC developed the first functional MAN.andM;Bell Atlantic, the Bell operating company based in Baltimore that providestelecommunications services to the mid-Atlantic states, sees an explodingmarket for MANs based on the projected growth rate of LANS.andP;  &quot;In 1989, therewere 1.2 million LANS installed.andP;  That is expected to double by 1994--thatmeans twice the number of LANs available for interconnection,&quot; says JohnHudak, project manager for MANs at Bell Atlantic.andM;Hudak predicts that wherever LANs are constrained by distance andperformance--for example, computer-aided engineering companies with officesacross town or a group of hospitals in a city--MANs will prosper.andP;  &quot;Thegrowth in high-end workstations on the desktop has been pushing the need forhigher [transmission] speeds,&quot; notes Hudak.andP;  &quot;And in thehealth care industry,sharing high-quality medical images fast is important to research addiagnostics.&quot;andM;Bell Atlantic, along with other Bell operating companies now schedulinglaboratory and field trials, expects limited MAN services to become availableby early 1991.andP;  The cost of the service has yet to be determined, but thetelephone companies say that price will be competitive with point-to-point T1services and less than DS3 high-speed services.andP;  The pricing structure willbe based on bandwidth on demand, as opposed to a leased-circuit type ofstructure.andM;At Competitive PricesandM;&quot;We realize that MAN service must be priced to provide an economically viablesolution to users for it to be competitive in the market,&quot; says SteveStarliper, the project manager for MANs at Pacific bell Co. in San Francisco.andO;The company has scheduled MAN lab tests for this spring and hopes to field aMAN trial by the third quarter.andM;&quot;The phone companies will price the service competitively, but even if it is[priced] a little higher than T1, the user will still benefit because hewon't have to reconfigure his network or buy or maintain equipment,&quot; saysRobert Reinhold, a senior manager at Network Strategies, the networkingpractice of Ernst andamp; Young in Veinna, Va.andM;For the initial public service offerings, ATandamp;T and QPSX are targeting thesame market of MAN-hunters: large and medium-sized companies that alreadyhave LANs.andP;  Customers don't necessarily have multiple sites; the supplierssay that MANs will be used frequently to communicate with trading or researchpartners, as well as with intracompany offices.andM;In the past, corporate data managers created primitive MANs to connect LANsusing T1 service, which is limited to point-to-point, rather than switched,transmission.andP;  Others have used Ethernet links.andP;  But neither service offersthe speed and flexibility of the modern MAN as d efined by IEEE 802.6, saysTemple's Papacosta.andM;A Better MousetrapandM;&quot;We were looking at Ethernet as one possible way to link our main campus withour health and Science Center, but this technology has a much higher upper[speed] limit for transmissions.andP;  This will be superior to an Ethernetlink--there is nothing available comparable to it,&quot; says Papacostas.andM;At first glance, the newly emerging Fiber Distributed Data Interface (FDDI)may seem to provide a similar service, but MANs are different.andP;  While FDDIoffers a maximum fiber span between nodes of 2 kilometers, MAN technology cango up to 50 kilometers without needing any nodes between points.andP;  Inaddition, FDDI's token-passing technology seems further removed fromincorporating voice and video than do Metropolitan Area Networks.andP;  In short,where FDDI is really a high-speed, point-to-point technology that will servecompanies well as a LAN backbone, MAN technology is destined for use by farmore network nodes and for delivery, at least initially, by common carriers.andM;The need for speed will drive many toward MANs.andP;  reinhold at Ernst andamp; Youngsays that in an Ethernet network accommodating more than one building, thereis an unacceptable rate of collisions of data accessing the network.andP;  Onlarger token ring networks, it takes too long to get the signal around theloop.andP;  With 802.6 MAN technology, the user gets high-speed transmissionwithout the access problems.andM;The Early SuppliersandM;Initially, MAN services will be offered through the public networks by theBell operating companies and independent telephone companies.andP;  A token ringor Ethernet link will connect the customer to the nearest phone company'scentral office for switching.andP;  The phone company's connection equipment, orclusters, will be joined together by fiber optic cable.andP;  End clusterstypically will have a token ring or Ethrnet port to the receiving customer,according to Hudak at Bell Atlantic.andM;Now that the IEEE MAN standard is almost established and technicalconsiderations are mostly ironed out, MAN developers say that pent-up userdemand for high-speed, citywide and LAN-to-WAN transmission services willdrive commercial offerings of MAN services onto the market quickly.andM;Already, ATandamp;T and QPSX are competing MAN to MAN with 802.6-compatibletechnology.andP;  QPSX has a U.S.andP;  unit called QPSX Systems Inc. in Holmdel, N.J.andO;The company is a joint venture of Telecom Australia, the University ofWestern Australia and the inventors of the MAN technology called theDistributed Queue Dual Bus (DQDB).andP;  In 1987, the IEEE 802.6 decided to useDQDB as the basis for its MAN standard.andM;QPSX has agreements with Siemens AG of West Germany and Alcatel NV of theNetherlands to manufacture and market the DQDB MAN technology in the UnitedStates and in many countries abroad.andP;  According to Reinhold of Ernst andamp; Young,the QPSX technology is an elegant design.andP;  &quot;In low traffic, it looks like acontention-based network, like Ethernet,&quot; he says.andP;  &quot;But in high traffic, itbehaves like a token ring, and contention doesn't slow down the access.&quot;andM;ATandamp;T's MAN PlansandM;A year after the 802.6 subcommittee decided to pursue DQDB as the basis forits MAN standard, QPSX announced an agreement to allow ATandamp;T to manufacturethe DQDB technology.andP;  After early negotiations, however, ATandamp;T decided not topursue a relationship with the Australian company.andP;  In stead, along with BellCommuniations Research Inc. (Bellcore), the Livingston, N.J.-based researcharm of the Bell operating companies, ATandamp;T has developed its own MAN, calledSwitched Multi-Megabit Data Services (SMDS).andP;  According to Starliper atPacific Bell, SMDS is different from DQDB in that it is designed to integratebetter into the Bell companies' infrastructure.andM;The Bell Atlantic/Temple University trial, scheduled to go live in September,will use DQDB.andP;  Yet the Pacific Bell lab and field trials will use SMDS.andO;Bell Atlantic says it will also field test the SMDS technology beforedeciding on a commercial service offering.andP;  ATandamp;T's project manager for MANs,David Yates, says the firm has shipped SMDS equipment to BellSouth, NYNEX andPacific Bell for lab tests.andM;Bell Atlantic expressed tis interest in the technology before any marketingagreements were completed, so OPSX Systems itself will participate in thefield trial at Temple University.andP;  If Bell Atlantic chooses to base its MANofferings on DQDB, the account eventually may be ref erred to Alcatel orSiemens.andP;  The public service providers now scheduling MAN tests all say theywill wait until field tests are complete to make a final decision on whosetechnology they will use for commercial service offerings.andM;&quot;The Bell operating companies are encouraging both technologies,&quot; accordingto a spokesman for Siemens.andP;  &quot;There is enough of a market that we [both DQDBand SMDS vendors] will not be the only ones in the market.andP;  There istremendous growth in this area, and once the service is available users willdiscover new applications for MANs that no one has even thought of yet.&quot;andM;Public or P rivate?andM;Despite their positioning of the technology as a public service offeringtoday, virtually all MAN backers agree that once the technology is proven,the equipment will be sold directly to corporate customers.andP;  &quot;we donht liketo compete with our customers by offering it privately as well, but we can'tclose that door right now,&quot; says the Siemens spokesman.andP;  the company expectsto roll out its major marketing effort in 1991.andM;ATandamp;T is working on a similar time frame, but is a little more emphatic aboutMAN possibilities for private networks.andP;  &quot;We do see such networks beinginstalled in private companies, but right now [we] have no immediate plans toprovide the technology outside of the public network,&quot; says ATandamp;T's Yates.andO;&quot;We are talking to a lot of computer vendors about building MAN technologyinto their computers or about the possibility of [their] marketing our MANtechnology to their hardware users.andP;  But we have no plans to sell directlyourselves,&quot; he adds.andM;&quot;Private MANs could be used on campuses and buildings but complemented by thepublic MAN services to offer wider interconnection,&quot; says Yates.andP;  &quot;These arenot necessarily competitive, but complementary.&quot;andM;Leila Davis is a freelance writer based in Alexandria, Va.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
