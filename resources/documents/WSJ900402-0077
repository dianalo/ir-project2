The two sides had been set to resume negotiations inTucson, Ariz., today, but within hours after the resumptionof bargaining was announced last Thursday, two more Greyhoundbuses had been hit by sniper fire and a bomb threat wasphoned into the company's Chicago terminal.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;We cannot resume negotiations while the violencecontinues,&quot; Greyhound chief labor negotiator P. AnthonyLannie said in a letter sent Friday to Edward Strait,president of the Amalgamated Council of Greyhound LocalUnions, the ATU's bargaining unit.   The company said that if there is no further violence, itwould be willing to meet with the union on April 9.   Mr. Strait responded angrily to the company's action,calling it a &quot;smokescreen.&quot;   &quot;This union has repeatedly and publicly condemnedviolence,&quot; Mr. Strait said. &quot;But these isolated incidentshave no bearing on Greyhound management's legal and moralobligation to negotiate in good faith, a fair and equitablecontract for Greyhound employees.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
