In order to carryout NO/sub x/ separation independently of the SO/sub 2/ content of thecrude gas, the invention proposes that in a first washing stage, alkalior alkaline earth bisulfites, e.g. calcium or sodium bisulfite etc.,should be produced, preferably by a weakly acid short period washingstage, where the bisulfite formed is added to it alone, or also to thesimultaneous washing stage, which simultaneously washes SO/sub 2/ andNO/sub x/, where polycarbonic acid (including EDTA) and/or phosphonicacid are added to this washing stage.</TEXT></DOC>
