The massacre by the 30 poachers occurred Sunday night at MeruNational Park, east of snow-capped Mount Kenya and 140 milesnortheast of Nairobi, the capital, said Minister of Tourism andWildlife George Muhoho.   Five rhinos were killed, he said. Several wildlife experts, whospoke on condition of anonymity, put the number at six.   Thirteen elephants also were gunned down in the last week indifferent areas, the wildlife sources said.   The killings came amid stepped-up anti-poaching efforts by thegovernment since August, when Muhoho revealed the slaughter of 92elephants in the previous three months and the government launcheda highly publicized campaign to stop the killing.   The white rhinos, which unlike the black rhino are notindigenous to Kenya, were imported from South Africa about 20 yearsago and lived under guard in a special reserve in the park.   ``People watched over them day and night,'' said one of thesources. ``The rangers were wounded trying to defend them.''   The poachers escaped after hacking off the rhinos' valuablehorns. One rhino horn can sell for up to $24,000 in the Far East,where it is used to make traditional medicines, and in the MiddleEast, where it is fashioned into ornamental handles for daggers.   The white rhino's numbers have not been reduced as sharply ashave those of the black rhino, which were thought to number morethan 60,000 in the early 1970s. Today, there are thought to beabout 800 black rhino throughout Africa.   Most of Africa's white rhinos live in South Africa, whereexperts estimate the herd at about 3,000 strong. Twenty-five to 30of the animals live in a private park in Solio Ranch, near theequator southeast of Mount Kenya, according to the Daily Nationnewspaper.   Both types of rhino are a rather dark gray, with their visibledifferences lying mostly in horn size and lip shape.   Kenya sent a paramilitary unit to Meru National Park to trackthe rhinos' poachers, said a government wildlife source. Hedeclined to provide details.   Gunmen in the last week slaughtered and hacked the tusks offfive elephants in southeastern Tsavo East National Park and eightelephants in the Mathews Range in arid Samburu district 155 milesnorth of Nairobi, the sources said.   Their deaths bring to about 150 the number killed since April,according to published data. Wildlife officials estimate the tollis much higher.   Studies by the Nairobi-based U.N. Environmental Program showthat in the past 15 years, Kenya's elephant population has dropped85 percent. An aerial survey in February of Tsavo Park and itsenvirons found less than 5,500 elephants, down from 35,000 in 1974.   Experts blame the intensifed slaughter on an all-time high ofivory prices, which have climbed steadily since the early 1970s andaverage about $82 per pound.</TEXT></DOC>
