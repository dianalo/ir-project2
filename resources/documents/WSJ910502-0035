The dollar rose,especially against the Japanese yen, while bond prices postedonly modest gains.   The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 42.33 points to2930.20 in active trading. Other, broader measures of stockprices rose, too. Standard andamp; Poor's 500-stock index closed at380.29, up 4.94 points, and the Nasdaq Composite Index, ameasure of small stock prices, was up 3.13 to 487.85.</LP><TEXT>   The stock market gains came as banks across the countrycut their prime lending rate -- on which many consumer andcorporate loans are based -- to 8.5% from 9%. Those movesfollowed the Federal Reserve Board's cut on Tuesday of thediscount rate -- which it charges member financialinstitutions for short-term loans -- to 5.5% from 6%.   Interest rates are being reduced in hopes of stimulatingthe moribund U.S. economy. Investors had been worrying thatwithout further stimulation to the economy, the recessionwould continue for several months more.   Analysts said stock prices got an extra boost from theNational Association of Purchasing Management's monthlysurvey, which indicated slightly more industrial activity isexpected during the coming months. Although the purchasingmanagers' index remains far below the level that indicates agrowing economy, the gain to 42.1% in April from 40% in Marchwas encouraging.   &quot;You look for turns in indicators like the purchasingmanagers' survey instead of looking at the absolute numbers,&quot;said A.C. Moore, a portfolio manager for Argus InvestmentManagement in Santa Clara, Calif.   The stock market's enthusiastic response to the interestrate reductions wasn't shared by bond investors. With theFed's long-anticipated discount rate reduction already behindit, the bond market stalled while awaiting details on theTreasury's big quarterly refunding operation next week. TheTreasury announced late yesterday that it plans to auction arecord $37 billion in notes and bonds.   Holidays abroad kept action in the currency markets at aslow pace. But traders said that after a minor setbackTuesday when the Fed lowered interest rates, the dollar isheaded higher unless widely held expectations of a U.S.economic recovery are derailed.   In major market action:                                                                                                          Stock prices climbed in active trading. Volume totaled181.9 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange, where1,155 issues advanced and 486 declined.                                                                                                          Bond prices edged higher. The Treasury's benchmark 30-yearbond gained less than an eighth of a point, or less than$1.25 for each $1,000 of face amount. The yield on the issueslipped to 8.16%.                                                                                                          The dollar strengthened.
