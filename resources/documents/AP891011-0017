Times Replaced With Phony Copies Criticizing El Salvador Coverage</HEAD><DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Vandals wrapped thousands of Los AngelesTimes newspapers with fake front pages criticizing the newspaper'scoverage of U.S. involvement in El Salvador.   The crudely fashioned cover sheets were discovered in Timesnewsracks from North Hollywood to South Central Los Angeles.   The phony front pages with a ``Los Angels Times'' mastheadincluded front-page stories with such headlines as ``U.S. WagesKinder, Gentler War in El Salvador'' and ``We Must Have BeenAsleep, Times Editors Declare.''   Salvadoran peace activists have used similar bogus newspapercovers in other cities, including Washington, D.C., and SanFrancisco, although no one claimed responsibility for Tuesday's LosAngeles incident.   ``We feel the perpetrators' view of our coverage is erroneous,''said Times Editor Shelby Coffey III. ``They are perfectly free tohave their opinions, but they are wrong in vandalizing our newsracks to express those opinions.''</TEXT></DOC>
