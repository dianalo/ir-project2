(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Law enforcement officials and scientistsfrom across the nation met here Friday to learn more about findingburied bodies by using an unusual study of buried pig carcasses.   ``Pigs come closest to humans in bone structure, blood type,''said Kim Castellano, an investigator with the Douglas Countysheriff's office.   Her agency and the Arapahoe County sheriff's office began theburied pig carcass study last fall, dubbing the project PIGS for``Pigs In the Ground Study.''   On Friday, the Rocky Mountain Division of the InternationalAssociation of Identification opened a two-day conference that drew140 law enforcement officials and scientists.   ``This is groundbreaking research. No one has really studied theeffects on buried bodies for law enforcement purposes,'' said SteveAdams, president of the Rocky Mountain division and a detectivewith the Aurora Police Department.   Volunteer scientists and law enforcement personnel have beenstudying pig burial sites at the Highlands Ranch Law EnforcementTraining Facility since last September.   Investigators said they have observed changes at the sites suchas different plants growing around the graves. They have collectedinsects that appear at the sites _ above and below ground _ andgases emitted from the ground.   The study has employed bloodhounds, aerial photography andinfrared sensing devices, too, during what may become a five-yearproject, officials said.   The idea of using buried pigs was developed last summer.Investigators from the Arapahoe and Douglas County sheriff'sdepartments and the Colorado Bureau of Investigation foundthemselves talking about how difficult and expensive it is tosearch for hidden bodies.   The immediate results of the innovative study have been sodramatic that the Rocky Mountain division has attracted its largestconference audience ever, said Tom Griffin of the CBI.   ``This is the most unusual conference in law enforcement I'veever seen with one effort,'' said Douglas County Sheriff SteveZotos.   ``The main thing that surprised me was the accuracy of thebloodhounds'' in locating the pig carcasses, said Castellano.``They went right to the pigs.''   Conferees have come from as far away as Fairbanks, Alaska, andIllinois and Texas and represent all branches of law enforcementfrom local police department to the FBI, organizers said.   The research project also has brought in entomologists,botanists, anthropologists, geologists, archeologists andgeophysicists.   After a concluding panel discussion Saturday, the conferees wereexpected to go out to the actual burial sites to study firsthandthe clues and observe the changes in the areas.</TEXT></DOC>
