Speaking on Iraqi television, Mr. Hussein said some gulfleaders had been &quot;inspired by America&quot; to take part in a plotto depress Arab oil revenues.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;Raising our voice against the evil is not the finalresort if the evil continues,&quot; he said. &quot;There should be someeffective act to bring back things to their right place. . .. Iraqis will not forget the proper saying that cutting necksis better than cutting (our) means of living. Oh GodAlmighty, be witness that we have warned them.&quot;   Although these threats are stronger than some he made inthe past, this isn't the first time Mr. Hussein has indicatedhe has his eye on the leadership of the Organization ofPetroleum Exporting Countries. In a long-running effort todominate the Middle East, the Iraqi president was moving inthat direction a decade ago -- until sidetracked in late 1980by the war with Iran. Since the cease-fire in that war, hisaggressiveness within OPEC has resurfaced.   On the basis of its oil reserves, second only to SaudiArabia's, Iraq already was a power in OPEC. But its oilinstallations were badly damaged and its production capacitycurtailed by the eight-year war with Iran.   For more than two years now, Iraqi oil officials have beentaking increasingly bigger roles in OPEC affairs. Morerecently, President Hussein's strategy has been to force upoil prices. In that regard, he blames Kuwait and the UnitedArab Emirates for &quot;economic warfare&quot; against Iraq and othersbecause of the world oil glut brought on by their chroniccheating on OPEC quotas. Since February, the Iraqi presidenthas been threatening retaliation against such overproducers.A few weeks ago, he wrote harsh letters to the rulers ofKuwait and the UAE, demanding they reduce output.   Now, Mr. Hussein's belligerence may be a product of Iraq'spostwar economic squeeze. With its war debt estimated at asmuch as $80 billion, Iraq is the most dependent on oilrevenues of all the major OPEC members. A reconstructionprogram, which has seen the rebuilding of the formerfrontline cities of Basra and Faw, as well as a vast militarybuildup, has been hampered by this year's decline in oilrevenues.   Revenues have fallen some 20% from last year's estimated$15.5 billion level. Oil provides around 95% of Iraq'sforeign exchange earnings, and over a year every $1 drop inthe price of oil costs Iraq an estimated $1 billion.   Moves against overproduction by the United Arab Emiratesand Kuwait started at the Baghdad Arab summit last May. TheUnited Arab Emirates has been overproducing its OPEC-setproduction quota by about one million barrels a day andKuwait by some 200,000 barrels a day. Partially as a result,oil prices have fallen from OPEC's benchmark target of $18 abarrel to as low as $14 a barrel. Prices have recently comeback to $15 a barrel following pledges by Kuwait and the UAEto adhere to OPEC quotas.   In his television speech, Mr. Hussein said that since thecollapse of communism in Eastern Europe, the U.S. is seekingto become the only world superpower and aims to control Gulfoil.   &quot;Saddam Hussein has been speaking as though he's the headof the Arab world,&quot; said Don Kerr, a Middle East expert atthe Institute for Strategic Studies in London. In April, Mr.Hussein threatened to &quot;burn half of Israel&quot; with chemicalweapons if it attacked Iraq. &quot;He has been the voice of theArabs standing against Israel, against Western economicimperialism, and here again he is the voice of the Arabsagainst the venal agents of the Western powers,&quot; said Mr.Kerr.   But Mr. Kerr doesn't expect the gulf states to be muchintimidated by Mr. Hussein's threats. &quot;Arabic rhetoric alwaysis colorful, so it's natural in the region for people todiscount what they are hearing,&quot; he said.</TEXT></DOC>
