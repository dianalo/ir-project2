Where individual company reports cover three month periods other than calendar quarters, the nearest comparable periods have been used. For all dollar figures, 000s have been omitted.    The table reflects the fact that many companies have closed down facilities, sold off assets or otherwise restructured operations. The &quot;net income&quot; columns include both income from other operations and the gains or losses associated with the companies' moves to reshape themselves. The &quot;net on continuing operations&quot; columns, insofar as possible, exclude such gains and losses. In cases in which the after-tax size of the gains or losses hasn't been reported, they are retained in &quot;net on continuing operations.&quot; The effect is to show how each industry would have fared in the quarter if its companies throughout the quarter had been structured as they were at the end of the period.
