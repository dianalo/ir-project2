Corrosion behavior was significantly different fromthat previously reported in nitrate melts at temperatures up to 600{degree}Cand involved a combination of oxidation, internal nitridation and sodiummetallate formation. Corrosion kinetics, determined metallographically,switched from a parabolic to a linear rate equation as temperature increased.Corrosion was uniform and resulted in metal losses on the order of 100microns/year at 630{degree}C. Among the alloying elements, chromium wasdepleted from the alloy as the result of a basic fluxing process. Thekinetic equations describing chromium depletion also changed from parabolicto linear with increasing temperature. The effect of the equilibriumchemistry of the melt on the corrosion behavior of the alloys is analyzedand possible corrosion mechanisms are discussed. 24 refs., 8 figs., 2tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
