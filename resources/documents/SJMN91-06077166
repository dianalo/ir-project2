Closing tax loopholes or exploring new revenues are among the manypossibilities worthy of review.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Editorial  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  'SPARE THE SCHOOLS' HAD URGENT MESSAGE  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Letters to the editor  </MEMO><TEXT>     While suspending Proposition 98 -- as some have suggested -- would donothing to overhaul the system, it would reduce education funding by more than$2 billion. It will mean more dropouts, fewer teachers, larger class sizes andoutdated textbooks and materials, at a time when the student population isgrowing at a rate of over 200,000 new children per year. It would also meanthat California would spend between $700 and $800 less per student than thenational average -- the lowest ever.;    Clearly, quick-fix solutions likesuspension of Proposition 98 provide no permanent remedy for the crisis weface and will only hinder the future of children.;    -- David Brown; President; Association of California; School Administrators;  GIVING $1 TOFUND FIGHTS CORRUPTION; Most Americans will face the familiar Internal RevenueService Form 1040 sometime in the next month.;    But most people probably donot realize that one of the major protections of our political system againstundue influence is embedded in the 1040. This is the opportunity for taxpayersto check off whether they want $1 of their federal taxes to be set aside forthe Presidential Election Campaign Fund.;    The purpose of using federaldollars to fund presidential campaigns is to reduce candidates' dependence onspecial interests and to place candidates on a more equal financial footing inthe campaign. There is no cleaner money in federal campaigns than the fundsfrom the Presidential Election Campaign Fund.;    This is not special-interestmoney. It is, pure and simple, $1 from individual taxpayers paid into a U.S.Treasury Fund and disbursed to candidates who agree to abide by legal spendinglimits and to comply with legal disclosure requirements.;    The $1 checkedoff ($2 for joint returns) does not increase the taxes an individual owes.These are earmarked tax dollars and are the only source of funding for publicfinancing of presidential elections.;    According to the Federal ElectionCommission, the Presidential Election Campaign Fund that supports publicfinancing of presidential elections will have insufficient funds to pay itsobligations for the 1992 presidential election unless more citizens opt tosupport the funds through the checkoff on their income tax.;    Thelegislation enacting this reform was put into place during the Watergate era.As the history of that scandal fades, people have forgotten the purpose of thecheckoff. Support the fund through the checkoff on your income tax form!;   -- Sandy Remmers; President; San Jose/Santa Clara; League of Women Voters;  Itisn't the gulf war; we oppose, it's war;  In his article of March 5, GeraldDavis declares: &quot;It is past time to admit -- gasp! -- that progressives havebeen wrong on this one,&quot; referring to their opposition to the United States'war with Iraq.;    Some of us who opposed the war are not the cynics, the handwringers or the Bush-bashers that the press and the Bush administration haveindicted. We are the true progressives, the Americans, the citizens of theworld who want to move forward in successive steps to the realization of theperfectibility of mankind. It isn't war against Iraq we dispute, but waritself.;    Why don't we admit we were wrong? Because the progressive neverforgets that time and chance happen to us all. We're all familiar with thelegendary gunslinger of the old West. While he remains the fastest draw, hesurvives, earning more fear and inspiring more hatred. Then one day, ayounger, faster gun beats him to the draw and ends his reign. It wasn't aprogressive who killed him, it was an imitator.;    And it will not be aprogressive who destroys this country, it will be this country's echo.;    --Bret L.
