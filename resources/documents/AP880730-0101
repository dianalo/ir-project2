(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A trapper attacked by a 10-foot,500-pound alligator suffered a mangled arm and a bullet wound inthe leg when officers accidentally shot him as they killed theanimal.   Lee County sheriff's detective Bill Cameron called the maulingof Joseph Hays the most terrifying thing he has ever seen.   ``He screamed, `Help me, help me, oh God, please help me,'''Cameron said. ``It was screaming like I've never heard before. Itsent chills down my spine.''   Cameron and three other officers opened fire with handguns,pumping about 10 bullets into the giant reptile. The gator remainedalive but released its grip on Hays, 22.   The officers pulled Hays clear of the alligator, then shot eightmore times before the beast was dead.   ``We weren't taking any chances,'' Cameron said.   Authorities later learned the alligator had been struck by anautomobile only minutes before it attacked Hays.   The alligator trapper from Port Charlotte was hospitalized inserious but stable condition at Lee County Memorial Hospital withthe injured arm and a bullet wound in the right calf.   He is the most recent victim in a series of violent encountersbetween humans and alligators in Southwest Florida _ including theJune death of a 4-year-old girl.   Friday's deadly drama began shortly after 10 p.m. in a darkenedfield in North Fort Myers about a mile from the CaloosahatcheeRiver.   Cameron was driving in the area when he saw the alligator lyingbeside the road. Fearing that joggers might run up on the gator inthe darkness, Cameron radioed the sheriff's department and waitedfor help.   Deputies contacted the Florida Game and Fresh Water FishCommission, who in turn notified a trapper licensed to handlenuisance alligators.   Randy Pearson, licensed alligator trapper for the gamecommission, and Hays, his assistant, arrived to capture the animal.The animal attacked when Pearson was sitting astride it, holdingits jaws closed while Hays prepared to tape them shut.   Game commission Sgt. Ray Hager said injuries probably made thealligator more aggressive than it normally would have been.</TEXT></DOC>
