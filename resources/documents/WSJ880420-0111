The very precision of the weekend assassination in Tunis of Khalil al-Wazir, the Palestine Liberation Organization official in charge of the occupied West Bank and Gaza, is the strongest evidence it was carried out by the Israelis and not any of Mr. al-Wazir's Arab enemies. The Syrians or Abu Nidal, leader of another PLO faction, probably would have machine-gunned the victim's wife and daughter as they stood watching from the next room.    But the murder of Mr. al-Wazir, who called himself Abu Jihad, is a case study of why Israel's policy of fighting terror with terror shouldn't be a model for the U.S. The assassination almost certainly will strengthen the PLO's most radical elements and make a peaceful solution to the problem of the occupied territories -- if that is what the Israelis really want -- even harder to find.    Mr. al-Wazir was a terrorist. As head of the &quot;western sector&quot; of Yasser Arafat's al-Fatah, he headed the PLO's efforts to infiltrate armed terrorists into Israel by sea in 1985 and probably approved the plan to hijack an Israeli bus earlier this year.    But his death is a graphic illustration of the weaknesses of Israel's anti-terrorism policy. First, assassinations, no matter how well planned and executed, muddy the distinction between terrorists and their victims. &quot;What the Israelis did, if you look at it in a firm, taxonomical way, is terrorism,&quot; says a U.S. intelligence official. The State Department Monday condemned what it called a &quot;political assassination.&quot;    Second, retaliation is a narcotic: ever-larger doses are required to create the same hallucination of power and satisfaction. The murder represents a significant and scary escalation of Israel's long-running war against the PLO. The Israelis tried to kill Mr. Arafat during their 1982 siege of Beirut, but they generally have refrained from attacking the PLO's political leaders, in part, perhaps, because the Syrians and more-radical Palestinians frequently did that for them.    After the murder of Israeli athletes in Munich in l972, for example, the Israelis hunted down and killed those responsible but spared Salah Khalaf, the top Arafat lieutenant known as Abu Iyad.    The Israelis now appear to have forsaken their informal agreement with the PLO in which neither side tried to kill the other's top leaders, perhaps tempting the PLO to go after Israeli leaders.    The Israelis may have decided to escalate their war with the PLO because they are frightened by the disturbances in the occupied territories and believe they can restore order by lopping off a head from the PLO beast. Or, it may be because they believe, as they did when they invaded Lebanon in 1982, that they can destroy the PLO once and for all.    If so, they will be as wrong now as then. Mr. al-Wazir, who helped found the PLO on the West Bank and Gaza, was an effective and popular leader there, but he didn't start the riots and his death certainly won't end them. He will be replaced, probably by another crony of Mr. Arafat such as Ahmed Mahmoud Natour, who leads a terrorist group called Force 17. It has claimed responsibility for killing Israelis on several occasions.    From Israel's point of view, Mr. Natour wouldn't be any improvement over Mr. al-Wazir and that is the third problem with a retribution policy: It often produces unintended and unwelcome consequences.    Mr. al-Wazir's replacement will have little incentive to continue the PLO's policy of keeping weapons out of the hands of Palestinian rioters so as to hold the public relations high ground against Israel. Worse, Mr. al-Wazir's death may fuel Islamic fundamentalism in the West Bank and especially in Gaza, where the most effective anti-Israeli demonstrations already are being organized by Sunni Moslem radicals.    That is precisely what the invasion of Lebanon did. Instead of ending terrorism and transforming Lebanon into a friend, the invasion scattered the PLO and invited the import of the Iranian revolution. With Syria's blessing, Iran and its fellow Shiite fundamentalists in Lebanon set to work blasting Israel, America, France and every other enemy of the Ayatollah Khomeini into the Mediterranean. </TEXT></DOC>
