At that pointthe collective confinement properties and the heating effects of alphaparticles become accessible to study for the first time. This paper outlinesthe potential performance of TFTR with respect to alpha particle production,the diagnostics which will be available for alpha particle measurements,and the physics issues which can be studied both before and during D/Toperation.</TEXT></DOC>
