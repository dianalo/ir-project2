(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Here is a list of the eight moons knownto orbit the planet Neptune.   Triton and Nereid were discovered from Earth. The moonsdesignated by numbers were discovered by Voyager as it approachedNeptune. Discovery of moons 1989 N5 and 1989 N6 was announcedThursday.   Diameters are NASA estimates and are rounded to the nearest 10miles. Except for Triton, Nereid and 1989 N6, the moons orbitNeptune's equator.   TRITON: 1,720 miles diameter, orbits Neptune every 5.88 days atan average distance of 205,000 miles above Neptune's cloud tops.Orbit is inclined 20 degrees out of Neptune's equatorial plane.Triton also orbits backwards, opposite the direction of Neptune'srotation. It is only major moon in the solar system with aretrograde orbit.   NEREID: 210 miles diameter, orbits Neptune every 360 days in ahighly elliptical orbit ranging from 847,000 miles to 5.97 millionmiles above Neptune's clouds. Orbit is inclined 30 degrees out ofNeptune's equatorial plane.   1989 N1: 260 miles diameter at its widest, orbits Neptune every26.9 hours at a 57,600-mile distance. This moon is potato-shaped,the largest non-round moon in the solar system.   1989 N2: 120 miles diameter, orbits every 13.3 hours at a30,000-mile distance.   1989 N3: 90 miles diameter, orbits every eight hours at a17,000-mile distance.   1989 N4: 100 miles diameter, orbits every 9.5 hours at a23,300-mile distance.   1989 N5: 60 miles diameter, orbits every 7.5 hours at a15,500-mile distance.   1989 N6: 30 miles diameter, orbits every 7.1 hours at a14,400-mile distance. Orbit is inclined 4{ degrees out of Neptune'sequatorial plane.</TEXT></DOC>
