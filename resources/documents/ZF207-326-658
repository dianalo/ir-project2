PCs to which jobs are to be sent -- called ''batch servers''-- log in as user batch.andM;Users whom the administrator places in the batchgroup can submit jobs toavailable batch servers.andM;We got PS-Batch running in 10 minutes.andP;  For our testing, we used our 286machine as the batch-user machine and our IBM PS/2 Model 80-111 as thebatch-server machine.andP;  From the batch-user machine, we ordered the batchserver to run a job using SPSS Inc.'s statistical package SPSS.andP;  This was along and complex set of tasks, producing a great deal of output that waswritten to disk.andM;Immediately after starting the job, we had control of our 286 machine backand were able to go on to other tasks.andP;  Several minutes later, we wereinformed that the job was completed.andP;  We asked that the output from the jobbe copied to our local disk for inspection and possible printing.andM;In essence, we borrowed a very powerful computer to do statistical-analysistasks that would have taken much longer on our 286-based batch-user machine.andM;PS-Batch supports multiple batch servers and job priorities.andP;  It evenincludes a utility that allows it to wait for an event before running aparticular job, thus making it possible to synchronize multistep batch jobs.andM;Contact Brightwork Development in Red Bank, N.J., at (800) 552-9876.andM;-- Barry Gerber</TEXT></DOC>
