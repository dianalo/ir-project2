The leader of the group, singer-songwriter Don Henley, displayeda check for $250,000 in announcing plans to save Walden Woods, theonce-unspoiled forest that Thoreau retreated to more than 130 yearsago to write his classic ``Walden.''   Seated in two neat rows at historic Faneuil Hall and sippingindividual bottles of Evian water were such celebrities as DonJohnson, best known for his role as a cop on ``Miami Vice,'' EdBegley Jr., who recently played a philandering husband in the film``She Devil,'' Bonnie Raitt, whose latest hit is titled ``ThingCalled Love,'' and Dana Delany, who plays the tough Army nurse on``China Beach.''   ``When I was 17 and went to school in Andover, I went to WaldenPond and went skinny dipping there,'' said Delany, dressed in ablack leather jacket and black stirrup pants. ``I wasunderstandably aghast when I heard what was happening there.''   ``Henry David Thoreau was 150 years ahead of his time,'' saidthe 42-year-old Henley, wearing a suit with a slicked back ponytailand glasses. ``His writing presaged the environmental movement andit seems appropriate to save his lands.''   The money was raised from ticket sales to two concerts headlinedby Henley, Raitt, Bob Seger, Glenn Frey, John Cougar Mellencamp andothers at the Worcester Centrum this week.   Henley organized the benefits after seeing a report on CableNews Network earlier this year about the proposed development of acondominium project and office park near Walden Pond.   The plan of the Walden Woods Project is to raise the estimated$8 million needed to buy the lands from developers MortimerZuckerman and Philip De Normandie. Henley said Wednesday thatZuckerman has donated $100,000 to the project.   The celebrities' plan also calls for the construction ofaffordable housing farther away from Walden Woods.   Others involved in the project include Michael Kennedy, son ofthe late Sen. Robert F. Kennedy and co-chairman of the Walden WoodsProject with Henley, novelist E.L. Doctorow, former U.S. Sen. PaulTsongas, and various state officials and environmental leaders.   ``These places of refuge are going to become paramount,''Johnson said. ``It's up to us to take a stand if we're going tohave a place to go and contemplate and know the Earth as it oncewas.''   Doctorow, author of the best-selling ``Ragtime,'' said:   ``Thoreau was an Everyman and he chose Walden to be hisEverywhere. Walden is a book that could only be written by anAmerican. We wouldn't exist as a people without this book. We haveto be able to say, `you read the book, now see the place.'''   Walden Pond is a 62-acre body of water in a 333-acre statereservation on the edge of Concord, an affluent town of 12,500about 20 miles from Boston.   The pond, however, is far less pastoral than when Walden livedby its shore in a tiny shack in 1845. It lies less than a hundredyards from a highway and is adjacent to a garbage dump.</TEXT></DOC>
