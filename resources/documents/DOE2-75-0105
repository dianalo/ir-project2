<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-75-0105 </DOCNO><TEXT>Energy and environmental policies have become more closely linked in recentyears. The acid rain debate in Europe and in North America is an obviousexample. Even though this and other environmental issues have generatedconsiderable political controversy both nationally and internationally,common ground has emerged in the policy debate within the InternationalEnergy Agency. This has enabled Member countries with differing energyand environmental situations to agree on a set of basic principles onenergy and the environment. Current issues include emissions of sulphurdioxide (SO{sub 2}), nitrogen oxides (NO/sub x/), particulates and carbonoxides resulting from the stationary combustion of fossil fuels. Stricteremission standards have been set in a number of countries particularlyfor SO{sub 2} and NO/sub x/ emissions. Because particulate emission controlsare well developed and in widespread use, they are treated only at themargin in this study. This study describes: progress in reducing theimpact of fossil fuel burning on the environment; systems in place forSO{sub 2} and NO/sub x/ control, particularly emission regulations andcontrol techniques, as well as efforts to promote advanced electricity-generatingtechnologies with an improved energy as well as environmental performance;economic and energy security implications of the various emission controlstrategies; and energy and environmental aspects of more rational useof energy, and of development of combined heat and power and districtheating.</TEXT></DOC>
