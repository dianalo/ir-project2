Subroto met Wednesday with Texas oil officials, who he indicatedhad expressed support for the Organization of Petroleum ExportingCountries' attempts to stabilize world oil prices.   The 13-nation cartel agreed last November to limit itsproduction to levels that would support a benchmark price of $18 abarrel, about 18.5 million barrels a day. The action has helpedcrude prices recover from their October 1988 lows of near $12 abarrel.   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the June contract for WestTexas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S. crude oil, settled24 cents lower Wednesday at $19.52 a barrel.   OPEC was to review its production at a meeting scheduled tobegin June 5 in Vienna, Austria. There has been speculation thatthe cartel would increase its self-imposed production limits ifdemand was strong enough to support higher output withoutdepressing prices.   Subroto said OPEC nations have been striving for stability at$18 per barrel, but he realized petroleum demand worldwide wasstrong and could support a higher price.   ``We are all along for cooperation between the major players inthe oil industry, including producers and also consumers, becausewe think only by working together and not antagonizing...we canbring the stability in the markets that we believe we can,'' saidSubroto.   Subroto had a 1{-hour breakfast meeting with Texas RailroadCommissioner Kent Hance, about 10 independent oil producers andothers at a downtown hotel. Subroto agreed with Hance that themeeting had gone well.   ``He has been instrumental in involving me in the thinking ofthe oil industry in the United States, particularly in Texas and soon,'' Subroto said. ``And we are very grateful for him to give anindication of the support of the efforts that OPEC has given toachieve stability in the market.   Hance said state energy consumers and officials appreciated theopportunity to meet with Subroto.   ``One of the important things is that we have to have a dialoguewith OPEC because they are the major player. They are so importantnot only to producers but to consumers in the United States,'' saidHance.   Subroto was scheduled to address a Thursday luncheon sponsoredby Southern Methodist University's Institute for the Study of Earthand Man in his only planned U.S. talk this year.</TEXT></DOC>
