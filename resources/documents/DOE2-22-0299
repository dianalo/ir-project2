These criteria have not in generalbeen taken into serious consideration when leaseholders have reportedreserves in the past. In fact, many 'reserve' figures quoted are probablymore correctly classified as geological resources. The industry now recognisesthat it is necessary to take into consideration not only grade and millrecovery factors, but also likely mining and processing costs as wellas the current market price for the commodity. Once having estimatedthose costs which are applicable to the resource under study, they canbe deducted from the gross inherent worth of the orebody to result inan estimate of the potential net revenue. Through a process of interactivetrial mine designs and evaluation, reserves can be quantified to providean estimate of the available recoverable economic reserves given a setof assumed cost and operational parameters. It follows then, that theavailable economic reserve recoverable from a given resource will varyfrom time-to-time as cost and price factors vary in response to changingtechnology and economic factors. A methodology is described which maybe used to derive economic recoverable reserves based on a computerisedmodel of the geological resource data and appropriate economic and operationalcost algorithms. Examples are provided from both coal and gold studiesto illustrate the impact of economic criteria on the magnitude of thereserve figure reported for each project. 4 refs., 5 figs., 1 tab.</TEXT></DOC>
