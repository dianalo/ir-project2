Alford, DMA'sprogram manager for optical disk applications.andM;DMA is responsible for distributing maps and other related data to theDefense Department.andP;  CD-ROM was chosen as the distribution media because itmeets standards and is popular with users, Alford said.andM;CD-ROM also has a high data-packing density of 650M per disk and isrelatively inexpensive, Alford said.andP;  With its volume discount, DMA canproduce a master disk for less than $1,500 and copies for less than $2.andM;Current products include:andM;* Digital terrain elevation data, which will fit on about 80 disks, Alfordsaid.andP;  Prototypes are available now, and production will begin in January.andM;* Digitized raster graphics, which contain &quot;dumb data sets&quot; of overlaidelectronic images of maps, he said.andP;  The 10,000 disks will be available onlyin CD-ROM format.andM;DMA has committed to using CD-ROM for most digital production data, but theagency &quot;will track other media for use when appropriate,&quot; Alford said.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
