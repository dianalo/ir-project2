Not until this past Wednesday, when he won a close election to afourth consecutive one-year term, was Mahlmann certain of majoritysupport among the 3,500 members of the world's oldest and largestcommodity futures exchange.   It was a vote of confidence after a year of scandal that beganJan. 19, 1989, when federal authorities revealed a sweepinginvestigation of trading fraud at the Board of the Trade and thesmaller Chicago Mercantile Exchange, which together account forabout 75 percent of U.S. futures trading volume.   ``I can't remember a tougher year in the seven years I've servedon the board,'' Mahlmann said in an interview.   The probe has resulted in criminal charges against 48 people.Fourteen have pleaded guilty to swindling customers.   A parallel investigation at New York's four major futuresexchanges was revealed in May but has yielded no indictments yet.   The Board of Trade's troubles multiplied in July when exchangedirectors exercised their seldom-used authority to order traders tosell soybean futures, forcing prices lower. The board claimed itwas necessary to prevent one grain company from cornering themarket.   The trading-fraud scandal brought cries for reform of therapidly growing futures industry and has delayed congressionalreauthorization of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, thefederal agency that regulates the futures pits. Futures contractsare agreements to buy or sell commodities ranging from agriculturalproducts to financial instruments on some future date at a priceagreed upon in advance. People trade futures to hedge losses orspeculate on future prices.   Amid the intense public scrutiny of the futures markets andtheir trading practices in the past year, the Chicago exchangeshave strengthened policing efforts, stiffened penalties forcheating and proposed reforms that address some concerns raised bythe FBI investigation.   But the toughest measures, such as restrictions on dual tradingand stricter regulation of broker associations, are yet to come.   Dual trading is the practice among floor brokers of trading fortheir own accounts as well as customer accounts. Brokerassociations are groups of independent futures traders who sharerevenues and pool expenses.   Critics say both practices provide opportunities for traders todefraud customers.   ``A lot needs to be done,'' said Rep. Glenn English, D-Okla.``If you review what's actually been done, we've had a good dealmore in terms of intentions expressed rather than real action.''   English sponsored a CFTC reauthorization bill passed last yearby the House. The measure would sharply curtail dual trading untilan exchange demonstrates an ability to better detect wrongdoing.   Senate action on a similar bill is pending.   The CFTC, meanwhile, is seeking public comment on a proposedrule that would limit dual trading but it's not as tough as thebills in Congress.   The Chicago exchanges defend dual trading as a means of keepingmarkets liquid when the customer order flow is light, thus reducingprice volatility. They bristled when curbs on dual trading werefirst suggested, but have since indicated acceptance ofrestrictions that would be lifted when highly accuratetrade-auditing systems are in place.   The Board of Trade and Merc are involved in a rare joint effortto develop a hand-held electronic trade-recording device. Themachine would replace the traditional paper cards on whichcommodity traders pencil in their trades.   The electronic trading cards and would zap the information toexchange computers, theoretically creating a complete,instantaneous record of all trades.   The exchanges have invited proposals for companies to design anelectronic trading card and hope to begin testing prototypes ontheir trading floors this fall.   ``It will make detection of abuses a certainty,'' said Mercspokesman Andrew Yemma.   But some critics contend commodities fraud will remain difficultto detect until the exchanges do away with open-outcry trading, a140-year-old tradition in which traders crowd pits and strike dealsthrough a seemingly chaotic combination of hand signals and shoutedbids and offers.   ``Verbal orders, executed by shakes, winks, hand gestures, spitand God-knows what, that's the window of opportunity for fraud,''said former Sen. Thomas Eagleton, who quit the Chicago Merc's boardof governors in November. He accused the exchange of trying toprotect a former chairman accused of failing to stop two of hisemployees from defrauding investors.   The Board of Trade and the Merc are working on electronictrading systems to supplement open-outcry trading, but neitherexchange plans to phase out the practice, saying it creates theworld's most efficient markets.   The futures industry has enjoyed remarkable growth since theearly 1970s, when financial futures were introduced. Volume hassoared from 13.8 million contracts traded in 1970 to 267.4 millionlast year.   Last year's industry-wide volume increase of 8.8 percent markedthe 21st consecutive annual rise.   The Board of Trade's trading volume fell 3.3 percent last year,though. Exchange officials blamed it on quieter agriculturalmarkets than in 1988, a drought year.   But John Damgard, president of the Futures Industry Associationtrade group, said industry-wide volume probably would have beenhigher if it weren't for the fraud scandal.   ``There's clearly been a price to pay for this,'' he said, ``andthe Chicago exchanges are right at the focal point.''</TEXT><NOTE>End adv for Monday Jan. 22</NOTE></DOC>
