 However, they also noted the often&quot;burdensome&quot; task of integrating the individual products to enable them towork together in the network.andM;These organizations based their decision about whether to standardize withproducts from one or two vendors, or to use a mix of products from severalvendors, on the size of their organization, the amount of financial supportand the presence of in-house technical assistance.andM;United Gas Pipe Line Co. in Houston requires that the network be limited totwo vendors' products.andM;&quot;As it is now, we have an IBM-Compaq environment.andP;  Our choice of vendors wasmade with price in mind,&quot; said James McCoy, director of computer services.andO;&quot;We had a problem with the integration, however, and decided to keep theproblem small by not involving other vendors.&quot;andM;On the other hand, the major benefit of a multivendor network is that acompany has the freedom to choose the products that best serve its needs inthe areas of hardware, software, network integration and connectivity.andM;As the computer industry grows with new products and applications, users wantto be able to benefit from the full range of available choices.andO;Standardization, to some users, means restricting their options.andM;&quot;We didn't want to be boxed in to one vendor.andP;  We began with Novell, but asIBM and DEC became strong, we wanted to be able to take advantage ofdifferent specialty areas,&quot; said Laurent Levy, assistant manager-LAN atRochester Telephone Corp. in Rochester, N.Y.andM;An evaluation of network-management tools at Martin Marietta InformationSystems Group in Chantilly, Va., convinced the company's management thatmixed systems are a necessity.andM;&quot;No one vendor can solve all problems,&quot; said Linda Devers, manager of LANstandards.andP;  &quot;There are different solutions on both the DOS and the Macsides.&quot;andM;Large corporations such as Martin Marietta, with 60,000 employees operatingon approximately 20,000 PCs and Macs, depend greatly on connectivity.andP;  &quot;Thereare a lot of things to consider when integrating systems,&quot; Devers said.andM;Bringing different types of systems together in one environment can beespecially difficult, because it is not the responsibility of the vendor tomake sure their product works with products from other manufacturers.andM;As a result, the in-house technical staff often must put together systems bythemselves.andP;  Even when products are theoretically compatible, &quot;what works inthe textbook sometimes does not work for us,&quot; said Klay Elwood, manager ofMIS at Pyropower Co., located in San Diego.andM;Despite the problems, Pyropower is currently buying equipment from morevendors than ever before.andM;As the American subsidiary of Ahlstrom Corp. in Helsinki, Finland, whichdesigns, engineers and constructs boilers to turn forest products intoenergy, the company is in the process of building a new world headquarters inSan Diego and is putting together equipment from a number of vendors.andM;The University of California at San Diego (UCSD) is continuing to addproducts from different vendors to its network as well.andP;  UCSD is a researchuniversity with approximately 17,000 geographically dispersed students.andM;The backbone of the university's network consists of fiber optics andbroadband, which is divided into subnetworks extending across 1,200 acres ofthe main campus in La Jolla, Calif.andM;&quot;We are constantly adding to our network at UCSD in order to grow and shapethe system the way we want it,&quot; said Steve Relyea, vice chancellor forbusiness affairs.andP;  &quot;Yes, problems occur from the standpoint that many vendorsmake a complex network environment, but for us it is a necessity.&quot;andM;The university's goal for its network is to develop a program that isinteroperable within the different subnetworks.andM;An issue that Relyea and others brought up is the problem of&quot;finger-pointing&quot; when it comes to a bug in the network.andP;  Problems take along time to solve because no one vendor will assume responsibility.andM;Laurent Levy of Rochester Telephone said: &quot;At one point the only way we couldget something done was to get all of our vendors into a room at the same timeto discuss the problem.andP;  Otherwise, the blame was put on whichever vendor wasnot present.&quot;andM;Multivendor environments are not for every company.andP;  Some companies wouldrather standardize on one or two vendors' products to avoid the complexity ofintegration and maintenance.andM;It is often the smaller companies that don't have the extra money forexperimentation with different products.andP;  However, many larger corporationsalso prefer standardization.andM;Shawn Hill, PC coordinator at General Electric Corp. in Somersworth, N.H.,andO;noted how comfortable the firm's officials were with the thought of stayingwith only two vendors.andP;  &quot;3Com boards and Novell NetWare are rock-solidproducts.andP;  We've had no problems and don't expect to add anything else atthis point.&quot;andM;For Battelle, a Columbus, Ohio, research institute, a homogeneous computerenvironment is very important -- so important that Battelle is trying to moveaway from a multivendor environment to focus solely on DEC products.andM;&quot;From the corporate point of view of Battelle, it is important for everyoneto do the same thing,&quot; said Bill Welch, a network specialist at the company.andO;&quot;Data comes from the centralized top of the business and has to bedecentralized at the bottom.andP;  It becomes too confusing having to traindifferent people for different applications.&quot;andM;Whether the good outweighs the bad in a multivendor network depends on theneeds of the business.andM;Small companies do not need the headache of administrating the systemthemselves and usually opt for a standardized environment.andM;Large corporations, however, need diversity.andP;  They need to base productdecisions on comparisons of power and price.andP;  In the long run, they aregetting more, but they are spending extra money and staff energy to installand preserve the network.andM;&quot;You have to decide how much you are willing to give in order to define whatyou are going to get,&quot; said Pyropower's Elwood.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
