Searle andamp; Co. (a unit of Monsanto Co.) once again illustrates the vulnerability of defendants facing such damages.    This is part of a growing trend -- punitive damages have skyrocketed in recent years. In California, for example, jury verdicts of $100,000 or more in punitive damages jumped from only seven in 1976 to 68 such awards in 1985.    Punitive damages are, according to the U.S. Supreme Court, &quot;not compensation for injury. Instead, they are private fines levied by civil juries to punish reprehensible conduct and to deter its future occurrence.&quot; Punitives may be awarded in many types of tort litigation including medical malpractice, product liability and insurance bad faith.    The law, however, gives very little guidance to judges and juries with respect to whether such damages should be assessed and in what amount. This lack of guidance, coupled with an increasing number of punitive damage awards, raises some significant constitutional questions.    Many legal scholars argue that punitive damage awards that are excessive when weighed against compensatory awards -- or against possible civil fines -- violate the excessive fines clause of the federal Constitution.    There also is concern whether the conventional method of calculating punitive damages violates the Constitution's &quot;due process&quot; clause. Most states permit juries to award punitive damages in any amount they choose and awards are oftentimes arbitrary and standardless. What this means in real life is that juries are free to make these decisions out of emotion, prejudice or caprice.    And, there is no protection against &quot;double jeopardy.&quot; A defendant can be &quot;fined&quot; punitive damages again and again for the same problem, even in the case where problem products have long since been removed from the marketplace.    Legal scholars, insurers, trial lawyers and others have anticipated for years that the U.S. Supreme Court would someday rule on this issue and either provide guidance or direct the states to do so. Former Chief Justice Warren Burger said that constitutional challenges to state punitive damages law &quot;raise important issues which, in an appropriate setting, must be resolved.&quot;    Although several cases recently came before the Supreme Court that involved punitive damages, the court did not address that issue and we are still waiting for the &quot;right setting.&quot;    In the meantime, some states are acting responsibly in confronting this issue. Four states, for example, have no punitive damages. More than 10 states now use a &quot;clear and convincing evidence&quot; standard for determining whether punitive damages are appropriate -- a high standard of proof to ensure that punitive damages are imposed only in those extreme cases where they are appropriate. In four states the judge, rather than the jury, now determines the amount of punitive damages and eight states have placed reasonable limitations on the size of punitive damage awards, and this is how it should be.    In addition, new laws are needed to ensure that no financial information -- a defendant's net worth -- should be admitted until after a jury has determined the defendant is liable for compensatory damages and has engaged in conduct warranting punitive damages.    Due process is a fundamental right. Yet, until changes are made to our civil justice system by the courts or through the legislative process, the reality is that unbridled punitive damage awards will continue to be unfair and unpredictable.
