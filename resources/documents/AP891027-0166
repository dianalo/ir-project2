Anderson's relatives, professional colleagues and diplomatsfilled a chapel at Georgetown University for an hour-long ceremonyon a day that President Bush and Congress proclaimed ``NationalHostage Awareness Day.''   The celebrants prayed, listened to psalms and received communionat a Mass officiated by the Rev. Lawrence Madden.   ``As long as he is a hostage, we are not free,'' said TomBrokaw, the NBC anchorman who said he was ``haunted by Terry'splight.''   He implored the radical Moslem Shiites holding Anderson andseven other Americans to ``reclaim your place in civilization'' byreleasing the hostages. ``No God would sanction such an act,'' hesaid.   Anderson, the chief Middle East correspondent of The AssociatedPress, has spent 1,686 days in captivity, the longest of anyAmerican hostage. Anderson's father and and brother have died andhis daughter was born since his imprisonment.   Former hostages who spent time with Anderson said he gainedstrength from his Roman Catholicism. He prayed often and maderosary beads from fibers on a mat.   Peggy Say, Anderson's sister and a staunch campaigner for hisfreedom since he was seized March 16, 1985, said the theme of hopewas appropriate because it sustains both the hostages and thoseliving without their loved ones.   ``Despite years of crushed expectations, false signs and brokendreams, who among us is not ready to believe that today could bethe day our miracle happens?'' Mrs. Say said.   Calling for warring factions in the Middle East to find peace,Mrs. Say said, ``It is my deepest hope that our hostages will nothave suffered so much for so long, in vain, and for nothing.''   After the ceremony, Mrs. Say, accompanied by the wives ofhostages Robert Polhill, Frank Reed and Alann Steen, all fromBeirut, met with State Department officials to find out what theBush administration is doing to free the hostages.   Department spokesman Richard Boucher called for the release ofthe hostages.   ``Our hearts and our thoughts are with the families of theseinnocent victims still held hostage in Lebanon. All hostages shouldbe immediately released and returned to their families as quicklyas possible,'' he said.   ``Nothing can be gained by the taking and holding of hostages,''he said. ``We will not rest until all of our fellow citizensillegally imprisoned in Lebanon are free.''   The three Americans who have died in captivity _ Marine Lt. Col.William Higgins, William Buckley and Peter Kilborn _ deserve aspecial honor, he said.   Generally, administration officials have tried to play down thehostage issue in an effort to avoid the kind of scandal thattainted the Reagan administration in the Iran-Contra affair.   Despite a ban on weapons sales, President Reagan sold arms toIran in an unsuccessful attempt to free the hostages. Reagan'saides diverted the proceeds of the weapons sales to the NicaraguanContras.   Meantime, Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, said that he has askedtwo congressional committees to investigate whether the Reaganadministration ignored leads about the hostages in the years1986-1988.   ``I studied three separate cases and watched them as theydeveloped, in which the government, when either presented with hardand reliable information or with overtures from credible sources,said not only no, but heck no,'' Grassley said in a speech on theSenate floor.   Grassley refused to discuss specifics, but he said he found it``frustrating to learn that information about the hostages inLebanon was being ignored. ...''   At the Anderson ceremony, Benjamin C. Bradlee, executive editorof The Washington Post, said all journalists feel an outrage atAnderson's captivity. It is ``way past the time for the cruel andunusual treatment of Terry Anderson'' to end, he said.   Others at the ceremony were former diplomat Bruce Laingen, oncea hostage in Iran; and journalists Walter R. Mears, vice presidentof The AP; Jonathan Wolman, AP Washington bureau chief; Peter S.Prichard, editor of USA Today; Peter Arnett, a Cable News Networkcorrespondent; R.W. Apple, deputy Washington editor of The New YorkTimes; and David Aikman, a foreign correspondent for Time magazine.   Among those attending were representatives of the embassies ofLebanon, Algeria and Syria, and State Department officialsincluding John McCarthy, the ambassador to Lebanon. The UnitedStates has evacuated all Americans from the embassy because offighting in Lebanon.   The ceremony was organized by No Greater Love, a humanitarianorganization which promotes peace and helps victims of war. It wasthe 20th such event organized on Anderson's behalf.</TEXT></DOC>
