The novel'sheroine, an attractive and engaging widow named Fanny Pye,has been living a pleasant, independent life in the largeLondon house that she and her late husband purchased for apittance decades ago just after they were married. The houseis now worth nearly $850,000.   Fanny has two grown children and some grandchildren, allof whom would certainly benefit from the sale of her house.She also has a salt-of-the-earth friend and housekeeper wholives in a jerry-built housing project; Fanny dreams ofsetting her up in a nice little cottage of her own. And thehouse, with its four flights of stairs, is starting to lookless inviting to Fanny as she contemplates the infirmities ofold age. But Fanny's motives to sell are balanced by herattachment to her home and neighborhood. She likes her lifeas it is.</LP><TEXT>   Then one evening, as she's walking home from her favoritelocal restaurant, Fanny witnesses a scuffle that results insomeone's death. Much to her own surprise, she finds herselfspeaking up to stop the fight and is hit on the head for hertrouble. The resulting temporary partial amnesia, coupledwith her anxiety about being witness to a crime she can'tclearly recall, undermines her confidence.   Harry and Isabel, Fanny's children, are too nice to applyblatant pressure on their mother, but their concern about her-- and about what will happen to the &quot;family money&quot; tied upin her house -- are all too evident. Fanny can well imaginewhat they are saying about her; she can practically hear thewhispers. &quot;Rambling, poor old thing, stubborn,&quot; she imaginesthem saying. &quot;Of course, you have to make allowances, she'shad a nasty shock, but she's always liked her own way, youcan't deny there's a selfish streak in her, what has she everdone for anyone?&quot;   The story of a gallant, beleaguered older woman and herself-centered, whining adult children might easily havedegenerated into a predictable tear-jerker with the kind ofcharacters and situation found in made-for-television movies.But Ms. Bawden's subtle characterizations go beyond thestereotypical. Neither a hapless victim nor a cutely &quot;feisty&quot;old dame, Fanny is portrayed as an intelligent and sensitivewoman, capable of generosity, anger, courage and even alate-blooming -- and very believable -- romance. Ms. Bawdenhas taken a timely subject but used the opportunity for anunsentimental exploration of the emotional ambivalences offamily relations as well as the economic paradoxes of thereal estate market.   In her equally prepossessing &quot;Field of Stars&quot; (WilliamMorrow, 253 pages, $19), Alice Mattison turns away fromtimeliness in order to follow the unfolding youth of anunprepossessing, not to say dumpy, Brooklyn Jewish girl namedSusan Sternfeld. By now, one would think, the subject ofcoming of age in Brooklyn had been rather sufficientlydocumented. But, as this novel reminds us, every life storyis slightly different, and Ms. Mattison, author of a storycollection and a book of poems, chronicles the quirks andoddities of this particular life with a rigorous honesty notafraid to sound awkward, so long as it remains true to themixed emotions it records.   Susan is born during World War II, and from the age ofthree is brought up by her father's parents, an ordinary andendearing couple named Ezra and Leah. Susan's parents aredivorced: She seldom sees her father, a traveling salesman,while her mother, Paula, more interested in meeting new menthan in raising her daughter, leads a semi-separate existencein the upstairs apartment of her former in-laws' frame house.   Growing up, Susan knows that her situation is different,yet at the same time, she cannot help taking it as &quot;normal&quot;because it's what she's used to. School forms a contrast toher home life: It is &quot;bright and sharp,&quot; with &quot;dangerousedges that could be seen and avoided.&quot; Home, however, is&quot;dark, like a drawer that hasn't been cleaned out in a longtime,&quot; with &quot;knives in it so deep under the broken spatulasand tarnished spoons that they have lost their shine and giveno warning before the finger touches them.&quot; Susan's familysecrets are not all that shocking: It's the murkiness andirregularity that are unsettling.   Yet when Susan meets the man she will finally marry,everything seems amazingly clear. It feels to her as ifthey'd somehow known each other even before they met. TonyDonnelly is from a large Roman Catholic family as &quot;normal&quot;and &quot;functional&quot; as any social worker might wish. But Tony'syoungest sister, Claudie, is a troubled, suicide-prone girl.Just as Susan is drawn to the Donnelly clan, so Claudie isdrawn to Susan, then (to Susan's dismay) to Susan'sunmaternal mother, the man-crazy Paula. And, to top it alloff, Susan finds herself powerfully attracted to another man,even as she is in the midst of starting married life.   Avoiding the splashy and the sensational, Ms. Mattisonportrays the surprising complexities of ordinary life -- itsunseen &quot;edges&quot; -- with careful attention to the nuances ofhuman relationships. The precision of her style and focusmakes this first novel well worth a look.</TEXT></DOC>
