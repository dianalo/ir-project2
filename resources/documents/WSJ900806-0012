Consumer electronics makers must move aggressively intothe computer field, Matsushita's president, Akio Tanii, saysabout the changing face of the industry.</LP><TEXT>   With the line between consumer and industrial electronicsbecoming blurred and with computer functions beingincorporated into household electronics products to controlthem, Matsushita must evolve into a diversified electronicsmaker, Mr. Tanii says.   &quot;Matsushita's emphasis on electronics for the home won'tchange,&quot; Mr. Tanii asserts. &quot;We have no intention of makingmainframes. We won't become an IBM.&quot;   But as word processors, fascimile machines and personalcomputers move from the workplace to the home, Matsushitawill adapt to supply the mass market, Mr. Tanii says.   Matsushita, whose consolidated sales of National andPanasonic brand name products were $37.8 billion in fiscal1989, is stressing six growth sectors, including informationand communication equipment, factory automation andsemiconductors, on its road to diversification.   &quot;The audio-visual sector will continue to be what peoplethink of first when they think of Matsushita,&quot; Mr. Taniisaid. But with telecommunications equipment such ascomputers, telephones, facsimiles and word processorsincreasingly merging with audio-visual equipment, Matsushitamust stress those fields as well, he says.   Electronics industry analysts say the move into industrialelectronics is a good one, as expectations of 10% growth forthat sector in fiscal 1990 and 1991 are far higher than thezero to 3% growth forecast for the consumer electronicssector.   Matsushita's results for the latest fiscal year point tothe company's change in direction. While sales of videoequipment, one of the company's traditional areas ofemphasis, grew just 2% in the latest fiscal year,communication and industrial equipment sales of products suchas personal computers, word processors, printers and factoryautomation equipment rose 24%.   &quot;We're aiming to maintain that level of growth,&quot; saysHiroyuki Mizuno, executive vice president in charge ofResearch and Development.   Matsushita's chief spokesman, Akira Nagano, said thecompany's shift into new sectors has lowered the proportionof traditional consumer electronics sales to 45% of the totalin 1989 from 58% in 1985.   Despite the changes to date, Matsushita's efforts so farhave left many industry analysts unconvinced the company issuccessfully adapting to changes in the industry.   Some assert that the giant electronics maker is too bigand bureaucratic to keep pace with changing trends. Many sayMatsushita's strategy of using superior mass productioncapabilities and an extensive sales network to dominatemarkets pioneered by smaller, more innovative companies mayno longer work in today's market.   &quot;With the consumer electronics market flattening out,they've got to become more innovative,&quot; said one analyst.   Analysts' coolness is partly a reflection on Matsushita'sability to buy its way into growth sectors. With $21.4billion in cash and short-term securities on hand, analystssee great potential for the company to acquire establishedcompanies in its chosen growth sectors.   But the company's stance concerning acquisitions remainscautious. &quot;If a good opportunity materializes, we will studythe possibility&quot; but Matsushita has no concrete plans aboutfurther acquisitions at present, Mr. Tanii said.   He says acquisitions will be considered only if they canhelp the company achieve its goals more efficiently than canbe done through internal development.   That caution has prompted industry watchers to urgeMatsushita to take greater risks and move more decisively toensure future growth.   But Matsushita's top management says its restructuring isalready well under way, positioning the company to remain aleader in the next generation of home electronics.&quot;Matsushita has already changed a great deal,&quot; says Mr.Mizuno, noting that communication and industrial equipmentwill soon account for 25% of Matsushita's total sales, upfrom 17% in 1985. And the company has the potential forfurther dramatic change, he said.   &quot;It's far too early to write off Matsushita as a stodgyold company that can't change,&quot; says Martin Berrisford,electronics sector analyst with Jardine Fleming Securities inTokyo.   The company's push into the semiconductor and electronicscomponents sector has been well received by industrywatchers. Sales grew 8% in the latest fiscal year to 781.2billion yen (US$5.23 billion) and Matsushita officials saidthe dawn of the semiconductor-intensive high-definitiontelevision, HDTV, era could boost the company from sixthplace in memory production to first.   But while the company's semiconductor outlook appearsstrong, many analysts doubt that Matsushita can wrest asubstantial enough chunk of the computer market from theindustry front-runners to boost the company's growth.   Mr. Mizuno, the head of Matsushita's research anddevelopment efforts, says such views ignore the changessweeping the computer industry. &quot;Up till now, computer makershave concentrated on closed architecture with proprietaryoperating systems, forcing customers to rely on a limitednumber of makers to build their information networks,&quot; Mr.Mizuno says.   &quot;But that day is ending,&quot; Mr. Mizuno says, and thecompanies that dominated the old era won't necessarilydominate the coming era.   The rise of open architecture, with computer makersadapting their machines to a common operating system, willpave the way for greater standardization, allowing computersto become a mass market product, the Matsushita executivesays.   Currently, Matsushita's computer operations have justbegun, officials say. &quot;We are still just beginning to study&quot;the options, according to Mr. Tanii, the company's president.By one estimate, sales of computers and work stationsaccounted for just 10% of Matsushita's sales ofcommunications and industrial products during the latestfiscal year, or just under 2.5% of the company's total sales.   But &quot;when computers become a {standardized} homeelectronics product, Matsushita will be the number onecomputer maker, Mr. Mizuno predicts confidently.   Matsushita's first giant step into the computer field willbe HDTV, company officials said.</TEXT></DOC>
