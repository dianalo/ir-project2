Advertising of tobacco products has been banned in theelectronic media since 1976.   Blewett said the government would amend the Smoking and TobaccoProducts Advertisements Bill to legislate the ban on advertising innewspapers and magazines.   He said there was sufficient evidence of a link between tobaccoadvertising and the taking up of smoking to justify thegovernment's decision on strong public health grounds.   ``Although advertising is not the only determinant in people'sdecision to smoke, research has established that it does affect andreinforce other influences such as peer and social pressures,''Blewett said.   The ban will bring Australia into line with many other countriesthat have outlawed tobacco advertising, including Canada, Norway,Finland, Italy, Portugal, Singapore and Iceland.   Blewett noted that research in Norway had shown ``substantialfalls'' in smoking among adolescents since a ban took effect inthat country in 1975.   Sports Minister Graham Richardson said earlier he opposed atotal ban on tobacco advertising because some sports relied heavilyon tobacco sponsorship.   He said that sport received about $16 million a year fromtobacco companies in Australia and that replacement sponsorships ofthat size would be difficult.</TEXT></DOC>
