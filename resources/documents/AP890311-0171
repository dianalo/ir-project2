(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Anxious to protect itself from potentialasbestos liability claims arising out of a past business, RaytechCorp. on Friday filed for protection from creditors under Chapter 11of federal bankruptcy laws.   ``This is not an issue of failing businesses, but rather onerelated to getting the structure issues resolved in a singlecourtroom with national jurisdiction,'' said Craig R. Smith, Raytechpresident and chief executive officer.   Raytech, a multinational manufacturing holding company based inShelton, Conn., said in a prepared statement that it was forced totake its voluntary action in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Bridgeport,Conn., because ``all other potential avenues for resolution of theissue in the courts have proven to be ineffective or impossible.''   The bankruptcy action involves only the holding company and notany of its manufacturing subsidiaries. Raytech makes specialtyengineered products for industrial, auto, aerospace and militarycustomers. In addition to the United States, it has plants in WestGermany, Puerto Rico and Japan.   The filing was the lastest in a complex case in which Raytech hassought to avoid involvement in any costly asbestos lawsuits.   Raytech was formed in 1986 in a bid to shelter the assets ofRaymark Industries Inc. from asbestos-related lawsuits. Raytechacquired assets from Raymark in 1987, but as part of the agreementRaymark agreed to protect Raytech against all asbestos-relatedliabilities.   Shareholders approved the deal as about 30,000 lawsuits filed byformer employees were pending against the company. Raymark, aStratford company, had used asbestos in brake linings.   Asbestos fibers, when inhaled, permanently scar lung tissue in aprogressive and debilitating condition known as asbestosis. Lungcancer and heart disease also have been linked to inhalation ofasbestos fibers.   Al Canosa, Raytech's vice president, said the Chapter 11 petitionseeking protection from creditors while the company reorganizeslisted $26 million in assets and said total liabilities were``unknown and disputed.''   Despite the maneuver to protect its assets, Raytech has beennamed a co-defendant with Raymark in more than 1,000 lawsuits. Theaction taken Friday will force the court determine whether asbestosclaimants have a legal right to seek damages from Raytech, thecompany said.   In February, an involuntary bankruptcy petition was filed againstRaymark, which resulted in Raytech's loss of indemnification byRaymark.   ``We paid Raymark Industries fair-market value for the assetsacquired and we did not acquire any assets or businesses that gaverise to asbestos-related claims,'' Smith said.   ``It is our belief and has been from the time of restructuringthat Raytech would be free from any asbestos-related liabilitiesflowing from past businesses of Raymark Industries,'' he said.   Raytech has no insurance coverage for asbestos-relatedliabilities, and Smith said the lawsuits threaten the futureexistence of Raytech.   Raytech, which manufactures fastners and inertia controlproducts, had a net income, excluding unusual items, of $7.7 millionon sales of $127.3 million in 1988. That compared with earnings of$6.6 million on sales of $132.4 million a year earlier.   Manville Corp., another large company who used asbestos in itsproducts, in 1982 filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy when faced withthousands of absestos lawsuits. The company, formerly the nation'slargest asbestos producer, emerged from bankruptcy protection in1986 after a reorganization plan established a $2.5 billion fund forasbestos victims.</TEXT></DOC>
