He said, &quot;This question, which we believe is the root question of U.S.-Soviet relations, has to be moved forward in the period remaining before the meeting of the ministers so that they could prepare productive agreements for approval at the summit.&quot;    For the Soviet Union and its Warsaw Pact allies, the &quot;root question&quot; at the bottom of the treaty announced Friday is not how to rid the earth of these missiles. It is how to uproot the ability of the U.S., NATO and Japan to defend themselves against nuclear and conventional missiles fired by Warsaw Pact armies.    At Reykjavik, President Reagan flatly rebuffed the Russians' desire to neutralize the Strategic Defense Initiative. Opinion polls were immediately taken and revealed that 72% of the U.S. public supported his position. Most people evidently have little trouble seeing the logic of SDI: Developing the ability to shoot down a missile that is trying to kill you makes sense. (It's also possible that the U.S. public has reacted to the published fact that the Russians are developing their own SDI system.)    It is likely that Mr. Reagan will reject yet another Soviet offensive against SDI. The White House should understand, however, that defense politics changed significantly last Friday. Arms control is a large symbol that will be accompanied by a globally televised display of fellowship between the U.S. and Soviet leadership. Summitry's aftereffects, however, ripple through the West and the Soviet Union in different ways.    The West learned last month that despite Leonid Brezhnev's arms-treaty summits with two presidents, Soviet defense planners had developed the SS-24, a sophisticated, accurate ICBM that is transportable on rail cars along 62,000 miles of Soviet train track. In response, a Soviet spokesman said blithely, &quot;The Soviet Union is carrying out its modernization of strategic armaments in conformity with SALT II.&quot; It is at least true that it has in no way felt constrained.    The White House, on the other hand, might look at how the politics of defense changed following the signing of SALT I. Defense spending as a share of GNP was 6.9% the year SALT I was signed, 1972. Thereafter it dropped steadily, to 5.3% in the last year of Mr. Nixon's presidency and to a low of 4.7% in 1979, when Jimmy Carter signed SALT II.    The relation between arms treaties and the shift of resources out of defense is no coincidence. A summit and its accompanying arms-control treaty are naturally seen as an act of peace, achieved by bartering some defense capability. The enormous political attraction of this phenomenon will once again be conveyed to Congress, its staffs and constituents; to Pentagon planning staffs, NATO defense ministries and their voters, editors and most importantly to the scientists and engineers who are making career commitments to develop SDI. Arms treaties alter incentives. At the margin, where the important choices are made between defense and other resource claims, serious defense loses support amid the euphoria of controlling arms.    Historically, U.S. presidents have dealt with the Russians from a position strengthened by the support of both parties. But not this White House. In what must have struck most foreign observers as a truly incredible spectacle, the Democratic Party's two most significant Senate figures on defense, Sam Nunn and John Glenn, spent Treaty Week attempting to weaken SDI.    Senator Nunn embedded restrictions on SDI testing in the defense authorization bill and said that if Mr. Reagan vetoed the bill, he'd seek deeper cuts in SDI's budget. Then, 24 hours before the Shultz-Shevardnadze announcement, Senator Glenn successfully sponsored an amendment that undermines the ability of the NATO countries to participate further in SDI research. Meanwhile, Senate negotiators are revising the Gramm-Rudman law in a way that takes half of any spending cuts out of the defense budget.    The president may have the treaty he wanted, but now that Washington is once again up in the thin air of summits and arms-control treaties, it will take more than speeches to keep SDI alive. It will require a fight, starting with a veto of the defense bill. If that means offending Senator Nunn's affection for a disgraced 15-year-old treaty, so be it. The INF treaty will be part of the Reagan legacy. SDI, however, is a larger and worthier goal. </TEXT></DOC>
