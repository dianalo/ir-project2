 That, however, is about to change.andM;NO MESSING AROUNDandM;Led by Joe Carter at the Chicago office, Andersen started developingexpert-system applications as part of its overall management-consultingstrategy.andP;  It saw the benefits of adding systems integration to itsprofessional-services arm, and that area of the business has become aspecialized corporate entity called Andersen Consulting.andM;In 1989, Andersen also founded the Institute for Learning Sciences atNorthwestern University in Chicago.andP;  The institute is a new AI lab headed byformer Yale researcher and Cognitive Systems founder Roger Schank, andAndersen has committed personnel resources and $2.5 million to it for thenext four years.andM;With the big push in the MIS world to outsource a lot of technical computingtasks that don't fit into strict MIS domains (payroll, administration, and soon), Andersen has already taken a big lead in handling the complex computingchores of some major American corporations.andP;  The company should beinstrumental in getting more AI into traditional DP shops that normallyhwouldn't take the chance on the technology.andP;  The following roads Andersen hasalready made in getting the mainstream to adopt expert systems as anessential part of corporate computing.andM;AT MICROSOFTandM;Designing the packaging for its many software products is one of Microsoft'smost daunting tasks.andP;  Product managers have the responsibility for design,packaging, budgeting and manufacturing for each product.andP;  Since each initialrelease is a new experience, product managers had to go through a completeproduct plan for every one.andP;  Andersen teamed with Microsoft to create aknowledge-based system to help production-management teams create and designnew products.andM;Microsoft's packaging guidelines--such as proper type, size of manuals, andnumber of packaging colors--were loaded into a Nexpert Object (from NeuronData of Palo Alto, Calif.) knowledge system.andP;  Cost information for eachpackaging stage was supplied by purchasing, and configuration rules wereloaded into the system.andP;  The result is the Product Manager Workbench (PMW),an application that helps bridge communications gaps among planningengineers, purchasing agents, and product managers.andP;  Based on the rules inthe system, PMW helps design new products and enforce corporate design andpackaging guidelines.andM;The system is integrated with Microsoft's Excel spreadsheet, AsymetrixToolbox, and a terminal-emulation package, all running under Windows v. 3.0.andO;PMw is accessible by more than 30 product managers throughout the company.andO;It provides not only cost of goods calculations to the manager, but alsoshows CAD renditions of existing products and allows the manager to reviewcosts for previous packages and designs.andM;IN HUMAN SERVICEandM;Andersen Consulting was asked to provide AI assistance for Merced County,Calif.andP;  social programs.andP;  County staff already spends an average of 45minutes interviewing prospective recipients of welfare, foster care, refugeeassistance, and food stamps, as well as handling nearly 1,000 different formsand a stack of manuals more than three feet high.andP;  One social worker couldconceivably encounter as many as 1,500 pieces of paper for a single case.andO;Additionally, 75% of caseworker time was spent double-checking work andcalculations.andP;  The huge workload resulted in high turnover, as much as 35%annually.andM;Merced opted to automate the administration of its social services.andP;  Thecounty decided it needed one system to determine an applicant's eligibilityfor a specific program and another to maintain the case over its life cycle.andO;Merced realized early that simple computerization wasn't going to result in amore efficient system, so Andersen was hired on.andM;Andersen created an expert system called MAGIC, accessible by 200 workstationusers via UNIX.andP;  Using caseworkers as experts, Andersen engineered theinterview process in a way most natural and efficient for the staff (drawnfrom various county agencies to achieve a streamlined methodology).andM;MAGIC guides each caseworker through interviews and determines options forapplicants based on responses.andP;  After processing the results to a completedinterview, MAGIC determines to which benefits (and to what degree) applicantsare eligible.andP;  The information is then stored in a server for future use bycaseworkers, and updates and revisions to policy and regulations are enteredby the personnel monitoring the server.andP;  Merced believes that MAGIC willreduce social workers' caseloads by 40%, primarily by reducing paperwork.andO;The result is that staff spends more time working cases instead of  pushingpaper.andM;AND JUSTICE FOR ALLandM;You don't hear about expect systems in law enforcement very often.andP;  Onereason for this is the shortage of such systems, due in part to the strainany computing process puts on the local budget.andP;  Another reason is thatlaw-enforcement officials are about as likely to embrace exotic new computersystems as Barney Fife was likely to be arrested for indecent exposure.andP;  Itjust doesn't happen.andM;Convicted criminals in Ontario, Canada have been sentenced manually forcenturies.andP;  The amount of prison time is based on the number of offenses; ifit's a repeat offense, an aggregation of sentences is built into one term.andO;Some of the factors built into these sentences include the applicability ofconsecutive sentences, satisfaction of sentence through payment of fine,previous sentences, escapes from incarceration, behavior on past parole orparole violations, intermittent or work-furloughed sentences, possibleremission of sentence due to good behavior, and determining the level ofcustody for young or first-time offenders.andM;The ministry administers some 400 correctional institutions, all overseen bya central bureau of clerks.andP;  They must make determinations on criminalsentences based on all of these factors, as well as other points related tospecific cases, and then issue sentences.andP;  Errors made by oversight orinexperienced staff could result in different sentences given to the sameprisoner, which would increase the ministry's legal liability.andM;All offender and prisoner information is maintained in a database systemknown as the Offender Management System (OMS).andP;  Data in the system includestangibles like charges and sentencing, bails on appeal, parole information,and behavior while in custody.andP;  To automate sentencing, the ministry slappeda straightforward COBOL system onto the OMS with some success.andP;  But theprogram could only issue sentences; it could not error-check itself ordetermine whether the information it issued adhered to all possiblevariations.andM;Andersen created an expert system called XSENCAL TO PROVIDE intelligentautomation of the process.andP;  XSENCAL, for Expert Sentence Calculation, wasdeveloped on a PC, where it downloads information from an IBM mainframerunning under MVS/CICS.andP;  Each factor in a criminal's record is put togetherby the expert system, which makes a judgment on sentence based on allrelevant data.andP;  It then prepares a report explaining the reasons behind itsdecisions and prints it out for reference.andP;  If XSENCAL cannot come to aconclusion for sentencing with 100% confidence, it alerts the attendant clerkon the OMS.andP;  Such instances are the only ones that still require manualcalculations.andM;Since it has been implemented, XSENCAL has reduced the time needed by clerksto perform sentence calculations by 80%-90%.andP;  Thus the system handles nearly100% of the sentences administered by the Ministry of Correctional Services.andO;It also has taken over 98% of the sentencing for youthful offenders.andO;Additionally, XSENCAL is being used to train new clerks in decision-makingand calculating sentences, freeing top-level experts from having to be oncall in all new clerk situations.andM;KEEP YOUR EYES PEELEDandM;Andersen has been busy the last few years creating a name for itself behindthe front lines of the pureplay AI vendors.andP;  It has complementary agreementswith some of those vendors to use their expert-system tools (such as AionCorp. of Palo Alto, Calif.), and in some cases, to work with them onexpert-system projects (Inference Corp. of El Segundo, Calif.).andP;  In additionto those I've mentioned, Andersen's other AI clients include NorthwestAirlines, Blue Cross/Blue Shield, and Bull Computing.andM;The more active the company gets in outsourcing and system projectmanagement, the more AI will filter into the mainstream.andP;  Andersen couldbecome the next major AI force on the horizon.andM;Harvey P. Newquist III is CEO of The Relayer Group, which publishes the AITRENDS newsletter.andP;  He lives in Scottsdale, Ariz.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
