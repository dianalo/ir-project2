Cryogenically sensitive nuclear emulsion was placed in the15-foot bubble chamber at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory andbombarded in a neutrino beam with a broad energy spectrum up to 200 GeV.The search for interactions was carried out along the track in horizontallybombarded layers of emulsion with use of a target indication system.Decays of a {Lambda}{sup +}/sub c/ baryon, a D{sup +} meson, and twoD{sup 0} mesons were recorded. The event with decay of a {Lambda}{sup+}/sub c/ baryon is interpreted as the production and decay of the charmedbaryon resonance summation/sup ++//sub c/ (2450) into {Lambda}{sup +}/subc/{pi}{sup +}.</TEXT></DOC>
