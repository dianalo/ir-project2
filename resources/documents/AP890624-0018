To Congress:You can't kill dial-a-porn. To the multibillion-dollar industry:Clean up your act.   The court's unanimous decision Friday said Congress went too farlast year when it passed a law banning all sexually oriented phonemessage services.   Only obscene messages, not messages that merely are ``indecent,''may be outlawed, the court said. It said a blanket ban would violatefree-speech rights.   A phone conversation, like an explicit movie or centerfold in anadult magazine, may or may not be obscene. That's for a jury todecide, on a case-by-case basis.   Material deemed to be indecent, rather than obscene, is protectedunder the Constitution.   The court acknowledged that Congress has a legitimate interest inpreventing children from being exposed to even indecent messages.But the justices said they are unpersuaded nothing less than a totalban will prevent kids from gaining access to such messages.   In other decisions, the court:   _Ruled 5-4 in a Virginia case that states are not obligated toprovide free lawyers for death row inmates who lost an initial roundof appeals.   _Said, by an 8-1 vote, the Justice Department has a legalobligation under the Freedom of Information Act to supply a weeklytax magazine with copies of all federal trial court opinions andorders in tax cases.   _Made it more difficult, by a 7-2 vote in an Ohio case, for olderworkers to prove their employers are guilty of illegal age bias inthe handling of pensions and other fringe benefits.   In the dial-a-porn case, the court said the FederalCommunications Commission's effort to use technology to restrictdial-a-porn messages to adults might work, resulting in ``only a fewof the most enterprising and disobedient young people'' gainingaccess to such messages.   Paul Maurer, a spokesman for the Cincinnati-based NationalCoalition Against Pornography, urged people to pressure telephonecompanies to drop dial-a-porn services.   The ruling, Maurer said, ``gives citizens a chance to reallyspeak out whether they want this stuff in their community.''   The ruling does not directly affect any state's regulation of thedial-a-porn business. But state laws deemed too similar to thefederal law could be challenged on the same constitutional grounds.   The court rejected industry arguments that the disputed lawimpermissibly imposes a national standard for what is obscene, basedon ``the least tolerant community.''   The argument is that a phone message originating in a city suchas New York, which tolerates numerous sexually explicit businesses,could be prosecuted and judged under the community standards of asmall town in rural America.   The court said that's a problem with which the dial-a-pornindustry itself must wrestle.   The court's three most liberal justices in freedom-of-expressioncases _ William J. Brennan, Thurgood Marshall and John Paul Stevens_ voted to strike down the federal law even as it applies to obscenematerial.   Dial-a-porn companies make their services available to callersthrough 976 exchanges.   The telephone company typically charges callers according toper-call rates, retaining a portion of the charges and giving therest to the dial-a-porn company.   The same 976 exchanges also are used for other, non-controversialtypes of messages such as sports scores, time checks and weatherreports.   Born in 1983, the dial-a-porn industry matured quickly. By 1984,according to court records, some 180 million calls were placed bycustomers in New York alone. The industry reportedly topped $2billion in income last year.</TEXT></DOC>
