The lesson seemed to be drivenhome Friday when stock prices rallied, pushing the Dow JonesIndustrial Average up 32.87 to a record 3040.25 -- 6.3% abovelast Monday's low. Other major indexes, already settingrecords at midweek as the coup collapsed, set some moreFriday.   &quot;I can take you back to 1962 and almost every time therewas a crisis, buyers made money,&quot; Mr. Awad says. He cites theCuban missile crisis, the Penn Central default, the Arab oilembargo and the Hunt brothers' alleged attempt to corner thesilver market.   Many investors adopted this attitude since the October1987 stock market crash. That sickening plunge in prices sentshock waves through the investment community. Individualinvestors sold out and swore off stocks. Mutual fundssuffered huge redemptions. And portfolio managers agonizedover why they didn't see the crash coming.   Yet a year later many of those same investors were kickingthemselves for not being aggressive buyers in the wake of thecrash. And that attitude spread as prices headed higher amidrobust economic growth. Now it is so widespread that even thethreatened collapse of the Soviet Union and a return of theCold War cost the Dow industrials less than 70 points.   Perhaps the most extreme case of crisis buying cameearlier this year. So many investors were waiting to buystocks cheaply if war broke out in the Middle East thatprices went up, not down, when the shooting started. A lookat how several money managers handled the coup crisissuggests that quick analysis, the discipline to stick to astrategy, and just a bit of luck can pay off when a crisisstrikes.   With news of the coup blaring out of television sets andradios early Monday morning, Mr. Awad says BMI's investmentcommittee made some quick assumptions and a short leap offaith in deciding to be buyers if prices tanked.   &quot;We made the assumption that the basic fundamentalsdriving stocks -- falling interest rates and rising corporateearnings -- remained positive,&quot; he recalls. The leap of faithwas that no matter which side emerged victorious in the coup,the Soviet Union wouldn't disintegrate into a bloody civilwar.   &quot;You might have your own feelings about how it should turnout, but for the pure goal of making money for your clients,it wouldn't make much difference which side won,&quot; he says.   Indeed, Mikhail Gorbachev's resignation as Communist Partychief amid moves to strip the party of its power over theweekend aren't expected to be major stock-market influences.   Mr. Awad says he concentrated his buying efforts on AppleComputer and Cascade International, a small retailer. Justthe previous week he had sold Apple at 54 7/8 and Cascade at11 1/2. The day of the coup he bought Apple at 48 7/8 andCascade at 9 7/8.   &quot;I didn't get all the Cascade I wanted,&quot; he says. &quot;By thetime you calculated the odds, made your decision and put inyour orders, the market was already coming back. There wereseveral other stocks that, had they been knocked down alittle further, we would have bought, too, but the declinewas too brief.&quot;   Paul Ehrlichman, vice president at Brandywine AssetManagement Inc., says sticking to the firm's discipline ofseeking value stocks helped it take advantage of Monday'ssell-off. The first reaction at the firm was to review theportfolio and decide which stocks were most overvalued andwhich ones on the shopping list were most undervalued.   &quot;When something like the coup hits, you don't know if it'sthe beginning of a major decline or just a buyingopportunity,&quot; he says. &quot;But you do know that by taking gainson what's up and buying what's been hit the worst, you'reprepared for both scenarios.&quot;   Thus Brandywine wound up selling most electric utilitystocks, which had been rising steadily as interest rates fellin recent weeks, and adding to its positions in suchlow-priced cyclical stocks as James River, Dana, Goodrich,Alcoa and Kmart. &quot;We know we'll have an economic recoverysome day and we want to stay in the most undervalued areas ofthe market,&quot; says Mr. Ehrlichman.   What Brandywine didn't buy was defense stocks, despite theurging of many brokers. &quot;We just ignored all the brokers whowere calling and saying the world has changed, you have tobuy defense stocks,&quot; he said. &quot;Real change doesn't happenfast. We knew the Cold War wasn't going to resume in oneday.&quot; Defense stocks surged briefly during the coup, but havesince retreated.   With its investment discipline guiding decisions, Mr.Ehrlichman said a crisis, like last week's coup, givesBrandywine a chance to rearrange its holdings much morequickly than would otherwise be the case. &quot;A crisis doesn'tchange your discipline; it just compresses the time frame inwhich you act on it,&quot; he says.   But some money managers didn't jump at last week's crisis.Arthur Micheletti, director of private client research atBailard, Biehl andamp; Kaiser in San Mateo, Calif., said his firmhad already decided that the stock market was overvalued andthat the economy was at best in the early stages of a verymodest recovery, with a slight chance of slipping back intorecession.   &quot;The first thing we did was analyze whether the coup wouldchange our fundamental view of the economy and the market andconcluded that nothing had really changed,&quot; he recalls. &quot;Wedecided not to do anything except get ready for a 100- to200-point decline. We were hoping that stocks would sell offand bonds would rally. But most people figured it was abuying opportunity and we never got the full panic effect.Now we're back at square one.&quot;   ---   Friday's Market Activity                                                                                                          A startling leap in orders for durable goods last monthpushed stock prices to record levels, capping a hectic week.   The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 32.87 Friday to3040.25, eclipsing the old record of 3035.33. Standard andamp;Poor's 500-stock index rose 2.84 to a new high of 394.17. Andthe Nasdaq Composite Index, a measure of small-stock prices,was up 2.76 to a record 521.06.   For the week, the Dow industrials rose 72.23 points, or1.5%.   Trading was active, with 187,010,000 shares changing handson the New York Stock Exchange, where 973 issues rose and 610fell.   Analysts said the 10.7% jump in durable-goods orders inJuly was a powerful signal that the pace of economic recoveryis accelerating. More important, new orders for non-defensecapital goods climbed 21.5%. Capital goods are widelyregarded as a linchpin of economic growth.   However, these strong gains will probably put on hold anyplans the Federal Reserve Board may have had for further cutsin short-term interest rates, some analysts asserted. Andthey warned that surging economic growth almost certainlywill trigger inflationary anxiety in the bond market. A bigrise in long-term interest rates could quickly choke offeconomic growth and bring stock prices to heel.   Stocks tied to the economic cycle were among the biggainers Friday. International Paper rose 2 to 70 3/8;Caterpillar added 1 1/8 to 48 1/4; General Electric was up 13/4 to 74 3/4 and Aluminum Co. of America gained 1 to 39 1/4.
