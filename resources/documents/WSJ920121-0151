On Friday, Nasdaq stocks lost a 1/2 point, whilethe Dow Jones industrials jumped 15.   George Jennison, co-manager of OTC trading at WheatFirst-Butcher andamp; Singer, attributed some of the selling in OTCtechnology stocks to a continuation of a recent shift amonginvestors out of last year's best performers and into stocksexpected to do well this year.   &quot;Anything that has been a leader the past six months istaking a beating,&quot; said Mr. Jennison. He expectsprofit-taking to continue to depress the market at times, butsaid that generally he sees &quot;sideways action for a couple ofweeks.&quot;   William Sulya, head of OTC trading at A.G. Edwards andamp; Sons,said many investors are holding off on stock purchases inanticipation of a deeper market correction. &quot;A lot of buyerswould like to see this market go a little lower so they couldpick up some bargains,&quot; he said.

Securities firms balked at using Nasdaq International totrade the shares of big stocks listed on the U.S. exchanges,such as International Business Machines and AmericanTelephone andamp; Telegraph, because of a Securities and ExchangeCommission limit on when they can sell those stocks short.They continued early-morning trading of those stocks on theLondon Stock Exchange.   U.S. Healthcare led the way as the most-active issue onNasdaq International with 69,500 shares traded during thesession, which runs from 3:30 a.m.-9 a.m. EST and coincideswith the hours of the London exchange. &quot;It was pretty muchwhat we expected, maybe a little slower because of the{Martin Luther King} holiday,&quot; said Bernard L. Madoff,president of a third-market securities firm that bears hisname. Madoff joined the launch in London with Shearson LehmanBrothers and Goldman Sachs. Sherwood Group participated inNew York.   The majority of the orders came from Europe and wereexecuted between 3:30 a.m. and 4:15 a.m. EST, Gary Guinn,director of Nasdaq International, said. Volume didn't pick upagain until domestic orders began flowing at 7 a.m. Intel wasthe second-most active issue with 14,500 shares traded;Microsoft, Amgen, Oracle Systems, Seagate Technology and SunMicrosystems all traded less than 10,000 shares. &quot;Spreads&quot; onthe stocks -- the differences between the highest price, or&quot;bid,&quot; at which someone is willing to buy a stock, and thelowest price, or &quot;ask,&quot; at which the same person or anotherperson is willing to sell, ranged from 1/4 to 1/2 point, or25 cents to 50 cents.   A one-sided trade was entered for Research Industries, thesubject of a negative article in Barron's magazine, with a $2spread between 16 1/4 and 18 1/4-volume information wasn'tprovided because the order wasn't filled. A one-sided tradesimilarly was entered for First Illinois, with a spread of 151/8 to 15 5/8.   The Madoff concern joined other securities firms indeclining to use Nasdaq International for early-morningtrading of large stocks listed on the U.S. exchanges becauseof the SEC's &quot;uptick rule.&quot; The rule currently applies to allstocks traded on U.S. exchanges, but not to OTC stocks, andlimits when market makers can sell stocks short -- or borrowstock to sell in hopes of profiting by replacing it later ata lower price. (Securities firms frequently use short salesto fill orders and make orderly markets.)   On Nasdaq International, the rule prohibits short sales oflisted shares unless a stock is trading above its prior-dayclosing price on an exchange. That restriction doesn't applyto the London exchange, and would put any firm trading listedstocks on Nasdaq International at a competitive disadvantagewith firms trading on the London exchange, Mr. Madoff said.First Boston and Castle Securities both said they decided atthe last minute not to trade listed stocks on the systembecause of the uptick limit.   The NASD has been in discussions with the SEC aboutlifting the prohibition.   ---   Anne Newman contributed to this article.</TEXT></DOC>
