Adler (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><IN> STK SCR BON </IN><G> SEC JUS </G><DATELINE> NEW YORK  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Defense lawyers for Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. and others have alleged that U.S. Judge Milton Pollack should be blocked from presiding over the Securities and Exchange Commission's case against them because the judge's wife is employed by a company that has business ties to Drexel.    According to individuals familiar with the apparently sealed motion to remove Judge Pollack from the SEC case, the lawyers argue that the judge's involvement represents a conflict of interest.    Judge Pollack, once a defense lawyer himself, is perceived by many defense lawyers as sympathetic to the government. He is known for having issued tough rulings in insider-trading cases, including a 1986 decision involving alleged insider trading before a tender offer announcement by Joseph E. Seagram andamp; Co. for St. Joe Minerals Corp.    Last week, Judge Pollack set a hearing for Oct. 11 on a motion that he be removed from the case, but grounds for the motion weren't made public. The motion was said to be sealed at the lawyers' request, and attorneys for Drexel, its high-yield &quot;junk&quot; bond chief Michael Milken and others have repeatedly declined to comment on it.    Judge Pollack had agreed to the SEC's request earlier this month that he preside over its massive civil case, which the SEC maintained was closely related to 13 private suits pending in his court against Drexel and others. In the SEC case, Drexel, Mr. Milken and others are accused of insider trading and other securities-law violations.    Moselle Pollack, the judge's wife, is understood to have inherited a small department store chain, based in Texas. That company is understood to have done business recently with Drexel. The business relationship is believed to involve a leveraged buy-out, financed at least in part by Drexel, in which Mrs. Pollack could stand to gain a substantial sum.    Judge Pollack wasn't available to comment on the matter. A woman who answered the telephone at his residence said Mrs. Pollack wasn't available.    The statute that governs the disqualification of a federal judge is drawn directly from the American Bar Association's Code of Judicial Conduct. According to that statute, a federal judge &quot;shall disqualify himself in any proceeding in which his impartiality might reasonably be questioned.&quot;    That statute also says that a federal judge must disqualify himself if &quot;he or his spouse . . . is known by the judge to have an interest that could be substantially affected by the outcome of the proceeding.&quot;    In addition to their concerns about his supposed pro-prosecution leanings, defense lawyers in the SEC's case against Drexel and the others are understood to be unhappy with having Judge Pollack preside over their case for several reasons.    For one, Judge Pollack has ruled that they must coordinate the SEC case against Drexel with the 13 private lawsuits for the purposes of conducting the pre-trial fact-finding process known as discovery. This would mean that lawyers in all the cases would have to question key witnesses such as Ivan F. Boesky together, instead of separately. The defense lawyers in the SEC case want their discovery and case to be separated from the rest.    The lawyers also fear that if Judge Pollack were to issue a ruling favorable to their clients, it could easily be overturned by a higher court aware of Mrs. Pollack's business ties to Drexel. And if the judge rules against Drexel and the others, they worry that the judge will have to bend over backward to prove that he wasn't influenced by an alleged conflict of interest. </TEXT></DOC>
