ITC Recommendation</ITAG>In its 15th Report to EPA, published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>of November 29, 1984 (49 FR 46931), the ITC recommendedthat OMCTS be considered for chemical fate and environmental effects testing.Chemical fate testing included water solubility, octanol/water partitioncoefficient, and biodegradation studies. The recommended environmentaleffects testing included acute toxicity testing with several species and,if indicated by the results of the acute tests, chronic toxicity testswith appropriate species.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Proposed Test Rule</ITAG>In the <T4>Federal Register </T4>of October 30, 1985 (50 FR 45123), EPA issueda proposed test rule requiring that manufacturers and processors of OMCTSconduct chemical fate and environmental effects testing of OMCTS. Chemicalfate testing included biodegradability testing in water and sediment usingthe eco-core method of Bourquin et al. (Ref. 1), aerobic and anaerobicbiodegradability tests in soil, and a biodegradability test in a sludgesystem. Environmental effects testing included acute toxicity tests withrainbow trout, fathead minnow, bluegill, sheepshead minnow, silversides,daphnids, mysid shrimp, oyster, and freshwater and saltwater algae; chroniceffects tests with a fish, daphnid, and mysid shrimp; bioconcentrationtests with fathead minnows and oysters; a marine sediment toxicity test;and a reproduction test with mallard ducks. EPA based this testing on afinding of potential for unreasonable risk of injury to the environmentunder TSCA section 4(a)(1)(A) and a finding of substantial environmentalexposure under section 4(a)(1)(B). These finds are more fully describedin the proposed rule.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Testing Consent Order Negotiations</ITAG>After issuing the proposed test rule on OMCTS, EPA amended the regulationsfor rulemaking to expedite the development of data for risk assessmentby establishing the TSCA section 4 testing consent order process. A consentorder is not based on formal findings and expedites testing while retainingthe same TSCA penalty provisions applicable under rulemaking.On March 18, 1988, the Silicones Health Council (SHC) submitted a proposalto EPA requesting EPA to develop a testing consent order for OMCTS (Ref.2). The SHC proposal contained most of the testing that EPA had includedin the proposed rule. EPA agreed to consider negotiating a consent orderwith the SHC and issued a notice, published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on April 6, 1988 (53 FR 11341), announcing thedecision. This notice also announced the time and location of a publicmeeting to initiate testing negotiations on OMCTS and requested that all``interested parties'' who wanted to participate in negotiations identifythemselves to EPA by April 28, 1988.Prior to the public meeting of April 20, 1988 the SHC drafted a consentorder on OMCTS and submitted it to EPA for review (Ref. 3). This draftwas modified by EPA and was discussed at the public meeting of April 20and a revised draft was discussed at the meeting of May 11. By December1, 1988, six OMCTS manufacturers: Dow Corning Corp., Union Carbide Corp.,General Electric Co., Rhone-Poulenc Inc., Mobay Corp., and Wacker SiliconesCorp., and two interested parties, the Silicones Health Council and theCounty of Onondaga, New York had signed the Testing Consent Order for OMCTS.The manufacturers agreed to perform certain chemical fate and environmentaleffects tests by specified dates according to the test standards in theAppendix of the Consent Order.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Use and Exposure</ITAG>OMCTS is a colorless oily liquid with a water solubility of approximately50 ppb, a log soil-sorption coefficient of 4.45, a log octanol/water partitioncoefficient of 3.8, and a vapor pressure of 1 mm Hg at 20anddegrees;C (Refs.4 through 10).Based on data submitted under section 8(a) of TSCA and by Dow Corning,the 1985 importation/production volume of OMCTS was 110 to 135 millionpounds and is expected to increase about 10 percent per year (Ref. 10).Approximately 80 percent of the OMCTS produced or imported is used on-siteas an intermediate in the production of polydimethylsiloxane polymers (Ref.9 through 12). These polymers are used in making surfactants, propellants,lubricants, caulks, sealants, and rubber products (Refs. 9, 11, and 12).The remaining 20 percent of OMCTS is used in spray cleaners and polishes,in paper and textile sizing agents, in detergents, as a defoamer in inksand paints, and in cosmetic products such as colognes, hairsprays, andantiperspirants (Refs. 11 and 13).The proposed rule on OMCTS included the results of several monitoring studiesreporting the presence of organosilicones in rivers and estuaries, effluents,sludges, and sediments at several locations in the United States, Europe,and Japan. After publication of the proposed test rule, the SHC submittedthe results of a monitoring study it had sponsored (Ref. 14). In this study,15 sediment samples from 3 estuaries and 8 sediment samples from 4 freshwatersites were analyzed for OMCTS and organosilicon. Effluent and sludge samplesfrom 3 waste water treatment plants were also analyzed. Organosilicon wasfound in 17 of 28 samples, but OMCTS was identified in only 1 sedimentsample from the Rouge River, Detroit, and in 2 sludge cake samples. EPAhas reviewed this study, and, although locations below manufacturing plantswere not sampled, the study is sufficient to show that OMCTS is not a widespreadenvironmental contaminant at concentrations exceeding 50 ppb.<ITAG tagnum="84">V. Testing Program</ITAG>A. Chemical Fate SHC has reported that OMCTS is not biodegradable in water and sediment,but due to its volatility, will not persist in receiving waters and sediments(Ref. 15). Under the Consent Order, the manufacturers have agreed to determine thesolubility of OMCTS in freshwater and saltwater, its volatility half-lifein freshwater and saltwater, and its biodegradability rate in a sediment/watersystem.B. Environmental Effects Several acute toxicity tests were summarized in the proposed rule. EPAjudged all the test data inadequate because they were based on nominaltest concentrations that exceeded the water solubility of OMCTS. Availablebioconcentration data indicate that the bioconcentration factor for OMCTSin fish may be as high as 10,000. On February 10, 1988, Dow Corning Corporation submitted the results ofa recently completed daphnid chronic toxicity test with OMCTS to EPA undersection 8 (d) and (e) of TSCA (Ref. 16). These data suggested that OMCTSwas toxic to daphnids at a concentration as low as 10 ppb. Since similaradverse effects were seen in the daphnids exposed to the solvent control,EPA and Dow Corning consider these data unreliable and inadequate to assessthe toxicity of OMCTS. In the Consent Order, the manufacturers agreed to a tiered testing program.Tests agreed upon are presented in the following table. <ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Table._Testing Plan for OMCTS</T4><H1> </H1><H1>Test methods</H1><H1>Start date \1\</H1><H1>Report date \1\</H1><ITAG tagnum="21"><T2>Tier 1 Tests</T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Solubility test in fresh water<D>40 CFR 796.1860</D><D>8</D><D>10</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Solubility test in salt water<D>40 CFR 796.1860</D><D>8</D><D>10</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Aquatic half-life<D>Smith \2\</D><D>8</D><D>10</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Aquatic biodegradation<D>Bourquin \3\</D><D>12</D><D>16</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Acute toxicity, algae<D>40 CFR 797.1050</D><D>12</D><D>16</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Acute toxicity, daphnid<D>40 CFR 797.1300</D><D>12</D><D>16</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Acute toxicity, rainbow trout<D>40 CFR 797.1400</D><D>12</D><D>16</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Acute toxicity, silverside or sheepshead minnow<D>40 CFR 797.1400</D><D>12</D><D>16</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Acute toxicity, mysid shrimp<D>40 CFR 797.1930</D><D>12</D><D>16</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Chronic toxicity, daphnid<D>40 CFR 797.1330</D><D>12</D><D>16</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Bioconcentration, fathead minnow<D>40 CFR 797.1520</D><D>12</D><D>16</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T2>Tier II Tests</T2> \4\</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Fish early life stage test<D>40 CFR 797.1600</D><D>18</D><D>24</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Sediment/invertebrate test<D>Adams \5\</D><D>18</D><D>24</D><F>\1\ Months after the effective date.</F><F>\2\ Smith, J.H., Bomberger, D.C.

Tier II testing includesa fish early life stage toxicity test and a test to determine sedimenttoxicity to benthic invertebrates. Tier II tests will be performed onlyif any of the LC50's from the tier I tests are andgreater; 1 mg/l, or themaximum acceptable toxicant concentration (MATC) from the daphnid chronictest is andgreater; 0.1 mg/l. If no such adverse effects are observed inany of the tier I tests, tier II testing is not required.EPA is not requiring that the manufacturers perform all the acute teststhat were identified in the proposed rule. EPA believes that if acute toxicityis observed, data on five species are sufficient to assess the acute toxicityof OMCTS to aquatic organisms. EPA is not including a mysid chronic testin tier II because EPA believes that both the toxicity data from the daphnidlife cycle test, and, if triggered, the fish early life stage test andthe sediment test with the midge, will be sufficient to assess the chronictoxicity of OMCTS.EPA is not requiring a reproduction test in mallard ducks because availablehealth effects data demonstrate that OMCTS is not toxic to mammals, andthus is not expected to be toxic to ducks. The rat oral LC50 is andgreater;2.0g/kg and antifoam A (5 percent OMCTS) had no adverse effects on rats ina 2-year feeding study (Ref. 17).The manufacturers agreed to perform the testing according to cited EPAtest standards and a specified test schedule. Tier I testing will be completedin 16 months with interim status reports due 6 and 12 months after thedate of publication of this notice. If tier II testing is required, itwill be completed in 24 months with an interim status report due after18 months.EPA and the manufacturers recognize that OMCTS is a volatile substancethat is soluble in water at extremely low concentrations and that a testmethod does not exist to measure OMCTS at concentrations below 30 ppb.Also, additional efforts are needed to develop test systems that can generatestable concentrations of OMCTS in water. The manufacturers will work onthe development of such methods and test systems during the period aftersignature of the Consent Order and before the first test in tier I is performed.EPA will use the data generated by these tests to determine the risk ofadverse environmental effects associated with the manufacture, use, anddisposal of OMCTS.<ITAG tagnum="84">VI. Export Notification</ITAG>The issuance of this Testing Consent Order subjects any person who exportsor intends to export OMCTS to the export notification requirements of section12(b) of TSCA. The specific requirements are listed in 40 CFR Part 707.In 52 FR 23548 of June 23, 1987, EPA issued 40 CFR 799.5000 as a listingof testing consent orders issued by EPA. This listing serves as notificationto persons who export or who intend to export chemical substances or mixtureswhich are the subject of testing consent orders that 40 CFR Part 707 applies.<ITAG tagnum="84">VII.
