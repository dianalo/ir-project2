(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Women once used hangers to end unwantedpregnancies. Now, health officials say a few desperate women areusing cocaine to induce abortions.   The National Association for Perinatal Addiction Research andEducation has heard of cocaine-induced abortions in every major U.S.city during the last three years, said Ira Chasnoff, president ofthe Chicago-based organization.   ``It's probably cheaper, faster and more efficient to do itthemselves'' rather than seek an abortion in a clinic, he said in atelephone interview Wednesday.   The group keeps no statistics on cocaine-induced abortions, butofficials in Miami and Detroit say scattered cases of women who usedlarge doses of cocaine to end pregnancies are showing up inemergency rooms as miscarriage patients.   Chasnoff, an expert on cocaine addiction and pregnancy, said thedrug causes blood vessels to constrict, cutting off blood supply tothe fetus, and stimulates the pregnant uterus to contract.</TEXT><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The White House has drafted a constitutionalamendment to forbid flag-burning and President Bush hopes to workwith Republican leaders in Congress to have a final version done asearly as Friday.

The sanctions, drafted late Wednesday by senior members of theForeign Affairs Committee, were virtually certain to be acceptedtoday by the full House as an amendment to a two-year, $23 billionforeign aid bill.   The move will ``send a very strong signal'' to China's leaderswhile steering ``a middle course between those who believe we shouldcompletely sever diplomatic and commercial relations with China, andthose who believe we should continue business as usual,'' said Rep.Stephen Solarz, D-N.Y., chairman of the Asia subcommittee.   In addition to placing in law moves already taken by Bush, thelist included suspension of trade and development programs, banningthe sale of police-related weapons and limiting transfer ofhigh-technology and nuclear materials or components.</TEXT><DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   In his first public statement as Communist Partychief, Jiang Zemin said leaders of the pro-democracy movement shouldbe severely punished and predicted a long struggle against``adversaries of socialism.''

These days, some are wonderingwhether their jobs might kill them.   It's called ``karoshi'' _ death from overwork _ or ``pokkuribyo'' _ sudden death. The number of such deaths among harriedJapanese businessmen is growing at an alarming rate, researchers say.   Victims share a common pattern: sudden deaths from heart attacksor strokes after months or years of extralong working hours underheavy stress, says Dr. Kiyoyasu Arikawa, who advises executives onhow to reduce their risk.   Arikawa found that sudden deaths among top executives haveskyrocketed in the past 20 years, from 10 in 1969 to about 150 in1987. Recently, he says, the number of such deaths has grown fastestamong those in their 40s and 50s, men who on average could expect tolive to about 79.</TEXT></DOC>
