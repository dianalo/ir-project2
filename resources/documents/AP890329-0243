NWA stock activity remained heavy Wednesday in the wake ofTuesday's announcement that an investment group is interested in apossible acquisition, but the price was down $2.50 a share to$67.87{ in late afternoon trading.   Northwest has not identified the investment group, which it saidholds a 4.9 percent chunk of the airline's 29.1 million shares.   The group recently notified the Eagan-based company of itsinterest in exploring ``a negotiated leveraged acquisition,''Northwest disclosed. However, no tender offer has been made toshareholders and the company won't say whether the investment grouphas made a formal purchase offer to the board of directors.Northwest vowed Tuesday to remain independent.   Louis Marckesano, an airline analyst at Janney Montgomery ScottInc. in Philadelphia, said he issued a ``buy'' recommendationWednesday morning for Northwest stock because of the takeoverspeculation and because balance sheet fundamentals suggest thestock could reach the $80 range by the end of this year without atakeover.   ``It's still below what the stock should be trading at,''Marckesano said.   The airline company has become a takeover target because it is aperennial money maker with assets that could be sold for much morethan their book value, he said.   Northwest, described by Aviation Daily as the nation's fourthlargest airline in revenue passenger miles, reported a recordprofit for 1988 of $135.1 million, up 31 percent from 1987.   ``There are assets to be sold and they could certainly stand alot more debt than they have,'' Marckesano said. ``Someone whowanted to take it over in the $90 to $100 (a share) range _ that'sperfectly feasible.''   A buyer could quickly sell Northwest's land holdings in Tokyo,for example, and use the profits to repay debt incurred in theacquisition of the airline, Marckesano said. Late last year aJapanese group offered to pay $350 million for part of the downtownproperty. The entire holdings could fetch as much as $500 million,analysts have said.   Northwest's Pacific routes, the envy of the industry, also couldbe sold to repay acquisition debts. Marckesano said a new owneralso could raise money by selling some equipment and then leasingit.   He said he isn't concerned about a ``poison pill'' defenseadopted Monday by Northwest's board of directors because he said itmerely protects against someone ``stealing'' the company.   Robert Decker of Chicago-based Duff andamp; Phelps agreed that the``poison pill'' won't stand in the way of a legitimate offer. Buthe said a sound leveraged buyout proposal is unlikely.   ``The scenario I can see is someone coming in and buying theairline and running it like it is,'' Decker said. ``To make thatdoable, it can't involve a lot of debt so it can't be a leveragedbuyout. Then you're down to a very few potential buyers for it.''   In a leveraged buyout, the buyers typically borrow heavilyagainst the cash flow or the assets of the target to make the deal.   Too much debt would cripple Northwest because the airline willneed all the cash it can muster in coming years to buy new jets,Decker said. The average aircraft in the company's 312-jet fleet is14.4 years old compared with the industry average of 11.7 years, hesaid.   Mark Daugherty of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in New York said theburdensome debts of a leveraged buyout would also make the companyespecially vulnerable in an economic downturn.   ``The idea of cutting back on capital spending and lettingexcess cash flow pay down the debt _ I don't think you could reallyget away with that,'' Daugherty said.   Daugherty and Decker also said the U.S. Justice Department couldpose a problem for suitors interested in a breakup of the airline.The proposed sale of routes, airport gates or other transportationoperations at Northwest would be subject to antitrustinvestigations, limiting the number of potential buyers, they said.   ``The industry is more concentrated today. There are fewerplayers,'' said Charles F. Rule, assistant attorney general incharge of the Justice Department's antitrust division. ``For thatreason one can say that a proposed further concentration is likelyto attract a good deal of Justice Department scrutiny.''   Yet another potential problem could rise from labor ranks atNorthwest. Guy Cook, chairman of the International Association ofMachinists District Lodge 143, which represents nearly two-thirdsof Northwest's 35,000 employees, said Wednesday that workers wouldgo as far as staging an illegal strike to prevent the sale ofNorthwest to a hostile buyer.   ``Our message to any potential buyer is very clear,'' Cook said.``If there is an indication on their part there will be a breakup,there's going to be all out war on this airline.''</TEXT></DOC>
