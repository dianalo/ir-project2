Richard Pandolfi, president and chief executive officer,also said analysts' estimates that the Melville, N.Y.,company would earn 65 cents a share in 1991 &quot;seemreasonable.&quot; Based on the company's 5.8 million sharesoutstanding, that estimate would put overall net income for1991 at $3.8 million, a 46% increase from 1990 net of $2.6million, or 45 cents a share.</LP><TEXT>   But the rise in annual earnings won't come from sales,which Mr. Pandolfi said should be about flat with theyear-earlier $110.8 million. The improved profit will be tiedto &quot;intensive cost-saving measures&quot; in all segments of thebusiness, he said.   Miltope is primarily a defense electronics contractor thatdevelops and manufactures computer-peripheral equipment, suchas printers, magnetic disks and disk drives that are built towithstand extreme environmental conditions and are used withtactical computers. The company also tailorscommercial-computer equipment made by other manufacturers tomeet specific environmental requirements, such as the abilityto withstand extreme temperatures or to operate at highaltitudes.   About $50 million of its sales in 1990 came from Miltope'sown peripheral-equipment business, and about $50 million camefrom &quot;ruggedizing&quot; other manufacturers' equipment. Theremaining $10 million came from its commercial segment, whichproduces airline-cockpit printers and a machine that printsout an airline ticket/and or baggage tag, with a magneticstripe containing passenger information.   In the Persian Gulf war, all the tactical weapons systemsaboard Navy ships used Miltope magnetic tape systems, Mr.Pandolfi said in an interview. Some of the systems are partof launch controls for cruise missiles, some are part ofintelligence systems. Miltope printers and magnetic tapedrives were used on Awacs surveillance aircraft in SaudiArabia that supplied information to battlefield commanders.   But despite Miltope's participation in Operation DesertStorm, &quot;the boost from the war was minimal,&quot; Mr. Pandolfisaid. Miltope had to speed up production of equipment alreadyon order, but the war didn't provide additional business.   Miltope's backlog is &quot;healthy,&quot; at about $80 million, butlower than the $100 million of a year ago, Mr. Pandolfi said.The company has bid on &quot;a number of major military andcommercial programs,&quot; and has had significant interest fromboth the U.S. and Europe. Domestically, Miltope recently bidon an Army contract requiring tailoring of a computer line.The contract, which could be $300 million over five years, isexpected to be awarded this spring. Miltope also suppliesNATO countries, after being cleared by the U.S. StateDepartment.   The company expects its improved profit margins to comefrom greater efficiency. In the past year, it reduced thenumber of employees by 10%-15%, to about 800, but it doesn'texpect any significant layoffs this year.</TEXT></DOC>
