A resident of the city of Coatepeque, 25 miles south of thevolcano, said ash fell on the city when the volcano eruptedWednesday and lava could be seen glowing on the mountain after dark.   Eddy Sanchez, assistant director of the seismology station inGuatemala City, said Santiaguito, 140 miles west of the capital, isconstantly active but Wednesday's eruption was unusual.   The National Emergency Committee and authorities in Coatepequesaid they were on alert. If the activity continues, coffee and otherfields in the western provinces of Quezaltenango, San Marcos andRetalhuleu could be affected, emergency officials said.   Santiaguito is considered a second crater of the adjacent12,447-foot Santa Maria volcano.
