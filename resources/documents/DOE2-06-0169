The author feels that,since the '86 article, a probable subsequent shift in Soviet doctrinehas come into focus, being reached in the 1982-83 period. He notes that,for the past 50 years, Soviet doctrine has emphasized deep offensiveoperations with attendant heavy diplomatic costs and that worked againstthe objective of avoiding world war. The immediate objective now is toavoid escalation from regional to world war; if this requires a defensiveposture facing NATO, the possible military disadvantages will, it seems,have to be accepted. In this connection, the Soviets now see an INF agreementas only one part of a much wider settlement they would like to reachin Europe, which would bring substantial political and economic benefits.</TEXT></DOC>
