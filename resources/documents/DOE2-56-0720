The technologiesrequired for their exploitation have also attained different stages ofdevelopment. Three of these six energy resources can be marketed in theform of electrical current only. It is apparent that the significantrole played by hydropower could be extended still further. A modern,effective technique for the utilization of biomass has yet to be developed.There is also scope for improvement in the technology used to exploitgeothermal energy. The state of the art in the tapping of all the othersources is by now satisfactory. The only two renewable energy resourceswhich make a significant contribution to worldwide energy supplies todayare hydropower and biomass, the latter by means of primitive techniqueswith poor efficiency and unacceptable ecological repercussions.</TEXT></DOC>
