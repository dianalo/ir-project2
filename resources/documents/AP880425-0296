But now more than $1 million worth of these high-techhand-me-downs are headed from America to the Third World.   Since setting up formally in March, the Global TechnologyFoundation has received pledges of computer donations worth thatmuch, and drawn requests for equipment from as far as Bangladeshand Zimbabwe, said one of the founders, Philip Friedman.   With the accelerated pace of innovations in research andtechnology, a computer generation can last as little as two orthree years in the United States. After that, obsolescence sets in.   Thousands of outdated computers are stacked in warehousesgathering dust. Thousands more are crushed or melted down. Stillothers are cannibalized for spare parts.   Upset with the waste, Friedman and two friends in Boulder,Colo., decided to set up a clearinghouse for diverting the U.S.computer glut to developing countries in the Third World.   Computer experts, American businessmen and Third Worldspecialists laud the idea.   ``For users in the Third World, this could leapfrog them intothe 80s,'' said Robert Curley, chairman of PC Distributing Inc.   ``I have never been able to bring myself to throw out perfectlygood equipment. This concept is very exciting to us,'' said Curley,whose Illinois-based company is one of the largest computerdistributors in the Midwest.   He estimated that his company's donations could amount to about$100,000 annually in used computer hardware.   For computer businesses, the donations are financiallybeneficial: they are a tax deduction and can save thousands ofdollars in storage costs, said Friedman.   Global Technology is asking donors to include manuals with thecomputers and hopes to put together training packages includingliterature and experts for the Third World users.   ``We're not just going to dump the stuff and leave them tofigure it out,'' said Friedman.   Global Technology has received the tax-exempt status of acharitable foundation and has applied to several foundations forgrants to fund transportation for the donations and management ofits projects, he said.   Gary Gaile, a geographer who serves on the foundation's advisoryboard, has worked on a separate project to introduce computers togovernment service in Kenya. Gaile, who teaches at the Universityof Colorado in Boulder, said Kenyans were ``thrilled with thecomputers. It gave them a rare skill in that society.''   He said the Kenyan government used to compile its budgetmanually, and was almost through the budget year before thedocument was completed. With computers, the budget is on time,Gaile said.   ``Here, it's difficult to dump old computers. There, wherethey're 10 or 15 years behind, these machines are more thanadequate,'' he said.   The YMCA is one of the first in line to receive GlobalTechnology's free computers. Michael Diamond, assistant director ofthe organization's International Division, said most of the YMCAsin 92 countries run themselves without computers.   ``This would give them a tremendous chance to improve theirmanagement,'' he said.   Computers would also be useful for the YMCAs' vocationaltraining and remedial programs in African and South Americancountries, he said.   Computer corporations do contribute some surplus equipmentoverseas. But most of the computers go to specific government oruniversity projects, but the emphasis is on supplying trainingexperts rather than equipment.   IBM, for example, is contributing to 200 projects overseas fordisaster preparedness planning, soil reclamation, public health andother programs, said a company public affairs official, LindaNardin. But most of IBM's contributionconsists of supplyingprofessional advice, she added.   Global Technology is also collecting medical and dentalequipment, agricultural machinery, construction machinery,telephone equipment, water testing and purification devices. Evensewing machines are welcome.</TEXT></DOC>
