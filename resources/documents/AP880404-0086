The fire was an accident that had ``absolutely no connection''with the visit of Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci, said DouglasRose, deputy director of the U.S. Information Service in New Delhi.   Carlucci arrived in New Delhi today and held two rounds of talkswith Indian officials on defense cooperation and the peace processin Afghanistan.   The fire began on the fifth floor, the building's top story, atabout 3:45 p.m. after sparks ignited flammable gas canisters storedthere, said S.K. Dheri, the city's chief fire officer.   He said the sparks came from men repairing or cutting anair-conditioning duct with acetylene torches.   About 150 firefighters battled the blaze for an hour at theAmerican Center, which houses U.S. Information Service offices, alibrary, theater, meeting rooms and a media center, Dheri said. Thecomputer center on the fifth floor was safe, he said.   Damage was estimated at between $100,000 and $300,000, saidState Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley in Washington. Rosesaid the damage was largely confined to the air-conditioning room.   The building is on a main street close to the central ConnaughtCircle shopping arcade. The street was closed to traffic.   Four cooking gas and oxy-acetylene cylinders stored on the fifthfloor exploded in the fire, Dheri said. Firefighters wore gas maskswhen they entered the building.
