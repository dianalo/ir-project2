In addition, installation and running costsmust be low. Furthermore, the system must take up little space and involvelittle interference with the fabric of the building. The principal componentsof the system are automatic temperature controlled inlet air terminalsand a special device in the form of a cowl which is placed on top ofthe ventilation chimney. The complete system eliminates the great drawbackof the natural ventilation system which is that air flow rate variesover the year from excessive to nil due to variations in wind conditionsand outside temperatures. Another advantage of the system is that a heatpump can easily be added on for recovery of heat from the exhaust airwhere this is convenient. Practical tests have been made on the systemand its components, both in the laboratory and in the field. Field testswere carried out in consultation with the municipal housing enterpriseKalmarhem in Kalmar which readily made a suitable block of flats availablefor the tests. (authors).</TEXT></DOC>
