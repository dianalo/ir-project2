(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>DEFINING THE &quot;R&quot; WORDS FOR AUTOMATED MAINTENANCEandM;&quot;Don't touch that program!andP;  It's working, sort of, and nobody quite knowswhy.andP;  It's the monster program of the system and really does most of thework, but there is no one left from the original development team who canremember exactly what it does.andP;  So we leave it alone and add enhancements tothe other programs in the system.andP;  Let sleeping programs lie.&quot;andM;This kind of warning, generally given to the new member of the maintenanceteam, became far too common to suit most modern MIS managers.andP;  From theircall for help was born the field of reverse engineering.andM;MAINTENANCE: THE MONEY PITandM;According to Eric Bush, chairman of Language Technology, Inc., Salem, Mass.,andO;&quot;At the beginning of 1987 there were approximately 750,000 programmers andanalysts in the U.S.andP;  alone, repesenting over $54 billion in annual outlay tosupport the current, largely manual, state of software work...80% of ourprogramming resources go to the adapting of software to meet constantlychanging business needs.&quot;andM;As more systems are developed, more dedicated maintenance programmers will beneeded to keep up with changing demands.andP;  But by concentrating onmaintenance, programmers are not free to create new systems.andP;  Automation ofthe maintenance, effort, or reverse engineering, is the most plausiblesolution to this dilemma.andM;In theory, reverse engineering holds great promise: The 80 billion or solines of code that demand so much of MIS resources can finally be broughtunder control with the use of Case tools that can read, analyze, document andrework code into a set of structured and easily maintainable programs.andO;Furthermore, in theory the programs can be converted into almost any otherlanguage, database, operating system, communications technology or hardwarethat is on the market today.andM;CAN VENDORS DELIVER?andM;The overriding question is whether the software vendors engaging in reverseengineering products can deliver on this promise.andM;Another question concerns the size of the reverse engineering/reengineeringmarket.andP;  Industry analysts agree that the market is difficult to define atpresent, but disagree on its size.andP;  The current estimates range from $30million to $100 million.andM;According to Dr. Carma L. McClure, vice president of research at ExtendedIntelligence, Inc. in Chicago, &quot;Most organizations are spending more money onmaintenance than on development.andP;  The forward engineering Case market is abillion dollar market.andP;  We think the potential [for the reengineering market]is just as great.&quot;andM;PROBLEM OF SEMANTICSandM;Among the myriad of problems facing the MIS director interested in employingCase tools for maintenance and systems development is the rather basicproblem of semantics.andM;Elliot Chikosfsky, director of research and technology at Index TechnologyCorporation, Cambridge, Mass., has noted that the software maintenance anddevelopment communities often fail to communicate on reverse engineeringtopics because they do not use the same terminology.andP;  Chikofsky's response tothis problem was to establish, with a wide-ranging ad hoc group, a set ofdefinitions for the most common &quot;buzz words&quot; in the field of reverseengineering.andP;  (&quot;Reverse Engineering and Design Recovery: A Taxonomy,&quot; E.andO;Chikofsky and J. Cross, IEEE Software, Jan. 1990.)andM;The definitions are as follows:andM;* Forward Engineering--the traditional process of moving from high-levelabstractions and logical, implementation-independent designs to the physicalimplementation of the system.andM;* Reverse Engineering--the process of analyzing a subject system to identifythe systems's components and their interrelationships, and to createrepresentations of the system in another form or at a higher level ofabstraction.andM;* Redocumentation--the creation or revision of a semantically equivalentrepresentation within the same relative abstraction level.andP;  The resultingforms of representation are usually considered alternate views intended for ahuman audience.andM;* Design Recovery--a subset of reverse engineering in which domain knowledge,external information and deduction or &quot;fuzzy&quot; reasoning are added to theobservations of the subject system to identify meaningful higher-levelabstractions beyond those obtained directly by examining the system itself.andM;* Restructuring--the transformation from one representation form to anotherat the same relative abstraction level, while preserving the subject system'sexternal behavior (functionality and semantics).andM;* Reengineering (also Renovation and Reclamation--the examination andalteration of a subject system to reconstitute it in a new form and thesubsequent implementation of the new form.andM;Reverse engineering products that offer automation solutions are nowavailable from a variety of vendors.andP;  These products fall into the categoriesdefined by Chikofsky, as well as two other categories--reusable code and codegeneration.andM;FORWARD ENGINEERINGandM;Forward engineering is already well established in the Case world due to itsuse in the development of new systems.andP;  Examples of automated softwaredevelopment products include Design/1 and Install/1 (part of the FoundationSeries) from Andersen Consulting, Chicago.andM;Design/1 assists in many traditional analysis and design tasks facingsoftware developers, such as data modeling screen and report designingend-user prototyping, word processing, and the creating and editing ofstructure charts.andP;  The software operates on a PC or PS/2 and can be connectedto a local area network so that all members of the development team can beprovided with up-to-date analysis and design information.andP;  Install/1 runs onthe mainframe and supports the implementation side of the developmentprocess.andP;  Version control, screen and conversation implementation, testingand test data management, and data and database administration are some ofthe tasks addressed.andM;Bachman Information Systems, Inc. of Burlington, Mass., concentrates on Casetools for databases.andP;  The Bachman/Data Analyst is available for forwardengineering DB2 designs.andP;  The Data Analyst provides analysts with graphicaltools and expert system assistance in developing, editing, validating,consolidating and reengineering information models.andP;  A clear picture of thebusiness information is displayed in the form of Bachman Entity-Relationshipdiagrams, which are independent of where or how the data is captured, storedor used.andM;David Gerber, manager of database administration for Coulter Electronics,Inc. of Hialeah, Fla., has been using the Bachman/Data analyst for over ayear and has found that it &quot;performs database design tasks the way I wouldhave done them.&quot;andP;  According to Gerber, database creation requests can be donetwice as fast with the Data Analyst, which he says is a major benefit.andM;Coulter used Bachman's products to develop a sales commission system thatruns in DB2.andP;  According to Gerber, Coulter experienced significant savingswith Bachman's products.andM;The purpose of the system was to automate the allocations and distribution ofsalespersons' commissions.andP;  Gerber used Bachman/DA to develop a conceptualmodel of the database.andP;  Ninety percent of the recommendations made by theproduct were ultimately incorporated into the final design of the database.andM;The Bachman/Database administrator (DB2) was then utilized to forwardengineer the model into a workable database.andP;  According to Gerber, the dB2data description language was generated in just one day.andM;Gerber said this project, which would typically require to two weeks, wascompleted in only four days.andP;  &quot;A second payback is that we got through manymore iterations of system design, which has resulted in a more stabledesign.&quot;andM;REVERSE ENGINEERINGandM;Most products that perform reverse engineering do so in conjunction withother tasks.andP;  Reverse engineering, as Chikofsky says, &quot;in and of itself doesnot involve changing the subject system.andP;  It is a process of examination, notchange or replication.&quot;andM;Bachman's Case tools are prominent in the field of reverse engineering.andP;  TheBachman/Database Administrator (available for both IDMS and DB2 databases)captures existing database definitions and automatically enters them into itsinternal design database where the user can edit the designs graphically.andO;The user is spared the effort of reentering already existing databasedesigns.andM;Despite its heavy use of resources (16Mb of memory on a PS/2 and slowinteraction time between the DBA and the PC), the Bachman products areimpressively powerful, according to Gerber.andM;PM/SS from Adpac Corp., san Francisco, provides a set of tools that extracts,selects, compares and formats information at the system level.andP;  Source code(Cobol, PL/1 or Assembler) or Job Control Language (JCL) is the input to theprocess which analyzes the structure and the content of the subject system.andO;And because it operates at the system, not just the program, level, it allowsthe user to make system-wide modifications faster and with a higher degree ofsuccess than would otherwise be possible.andM;InterPort Software Corp. of Burke, Va., has entered the reverse engineeringmarketplace with a product called InterCase.andP;  According to Mark Crego,president, &quot;Most people are dealing with the reality of not being able tomaintain their source code.&quot;andM;InterCase utilizes a workbench approach to analyze existing source code andlet users define their own rules for code analysis, extraction and recovery.andO;The entire application is read, including source code, screens, databasedefinitions and JCL.andP;  The tool makes use of parser and compiler techniques totranslate code into a repository, where further analyses or transformationscan be performed.andP;  By adding functionality to the product, users cancustomize it for different languages and standards.andM;A start-up firm, InterPort had five customers as of March.andP;  Several of themwere software vendors, whom Crego declined to identify.andP;  He said the softwaresuppliers intend to incorporate the InterPort product into their own reverseengineering product lines.andM;Viasoft Inc. of Phoenix, Ariz., is planning to announce a new reverseengineering product called Renaissance in the latter half of this year.andP;  Itsmain function is to build higher-level, graphical views of Cobol programs,allowing programmers to isolate, extract and manage applications based ontheir business rules.andP;  Viasoft intends to combine this facility with a codeanalysis and design product, dubbed Insight, and a soon-to-be-announcedproduct called SmartEdit.andM;Viasoft's SmartEdit is a Cobol intelligent workbench that allows programmersto edit source code or extracted business rules, find relationships, testchanges and regenerate a newly designed program or an independent reusableprogram.andM;REDOCUMENTATIONandM;Most Case tools for existing systems can perform some redocumentation.andO;Global Software, Inc. of Duxbury, Mass., has two products--Urma andOlga--that read existing programs (source code) and JCL, and load a datadictionary with the information pertaining to the subject system andprograms.andP;  Urma is particularly interesting in that it can read both thesource code and data dictionary, intelligently updating the data dictionaryrather than rewriting over it.andP;  It therefore preserves previous documentationefforts.andM;Another aspect of redocumentation is evident in the Structure map productfrom Mentor Graphics of Beaverton, Ore.andP;  This product automatically generatesa structure chart from standard C source code, giving a road map of theentire program.andP;  It has the ability to take source code and produce arepresentation of the interaction of software modules, thereby providing ahigh-level, complete view of the program.andP;  Structure Map also providesmetrics on the complexity of the C code and can be used with the company'sdebugger, CodeLink Station.andM;In the area of design recovery, no products fully meet Chikofsky'sdefinition.andP;  Several can abstract the structure and design of a system, butthey fall short in continuously refining and adding the human dimension of&quot;fuzzy knowledge&quot; to the computer-generated model.andP;  One Case product thatattempts this is InterCase from InterPort.andP;  InterCase's reverse engineeringcapability is enhanced by its &quot;rule-based&quot; approach to reading theapplication source program, screen and database definitions and JCL.andP;  Inother words, users can define their own rules for code analysis, extractionand recovery.andM;This approach acknolwedges the fact that most MIS shops have not designed andimplemented their systems in the same way.andP;  Different methodologies, softwareproductivity aids and programming techniques abound.andM;InterPort's Credgo said, &quot;It requires an iterative process to get parsers tothe state of completeness needed to extract the meaning of a system from thecode.andP;  Reverse engineering does require human intelligence.&quot;andM;According to Chikofsky, transforming code into a more structured format isnot the only type of restructuring that can be performed on a program.andP;  Datanormalization and conversion from a set of IF statements to a Case statementare examples of other types of restructuring.andP;  Understanding what the programdoes is not very important; it is only important to retain the samefunctionality as the original.andP;  Language Technology's Recorder is a majorplayer in this area.andP;  According to Bush, Recorder reverse engineers designspecifications from the Cobol code, changes the design to a structured formatand then regenerates structured Cobol code.andM;Recorder currently retains the same functionality in the restructuredprogram; work is underway to allow the programmer to make changes to theoriginal design prior to generating the new program.andP;  This project,code-named Chrysalis, will move Recoder into the realm of code generation.andM;XA Systems Corp. of Los Gatos, Calif., has two products that fit the generaldefinition of restructuring.andP;  Datatecs-DS, operating on Cobol source code inthe mainframe environment, is used to convert undocumented, inconsistent datadefinitions into standardized data elements and record definitions.andO;Datatec-DS is also available for command-level CICS, IMS DB/DC, and DB2programs.andM;Retrofit is XA's Cobol restructuring tool.andP;  It is well suited to the task ofbringing order to the chaotic world of old, unstructured code.andP;  Retrofit usesparameters to provide the flexibility to handle any installation standards;for example, disallowing certain constructs (IF NOT) and the like.andP;  Retrofitis available on the mainframe and on the IBM PC and Unisys and Bullplatforms.andM;Restructuring also plays a part in reengineering.andP;  According to Chikofsky,&quot;Reengineering generally includes some form of reverse engineering [toachieve a more abstract description] followed by some form of fowardengineering or restructuring.&quot;andM;Typically, additional functionality is added during the reengineeringprocess.andP;  Among the products that fit this category are Language Technology'sRecoder, XA's Datatec-DS and the Bachman suite of database tools.andM;Reusable code offers another solution to the backlog problem in systemsdevelopment.andP;  On a small scale, the idea has been around for many years.andO;Utility programs, report generators and the like have been available sincethe early days of computing and have been invaluable to most MIS departments.andO;What is different about this new approach to reusable code is its focus onspecific applications.andM;The Master Financial System (MFS) from Computrol, Inc., Chesterfield, Mo.,andO;consists of an impressive set of reusable program functions that representsabout 75% of any financial application.andP;  According to Bob Parks, president,&quot;Almost every computer application has to perform the same functions; data iswhat differs.&quot;andM;To separate data elements from the functions, Computrol creates aninteractive dictionary that passes the data to the functions.andP;  The functionalroutines themselves are common across some, if not all, applications.andO;Examples include check-writing routines and interest calculation modules.andM;Any file can be defined to the interactive dictionary, and the system allowsthe realtime creation of screens.andP;  Screen layouts, edits, conversation flow,security and value limits are all included in the screen creation process.andP;  Anonprogrammer can build 50 or so screens in under four hours.andM;The system also accommodates a few foreign languages.andM;A change to the MFS system lets developers build new sets of screens fromdesign through editing and screen-to-screen communication, under the controlof a single function key.andM;AFS SECURITIES PICKS MFSandM;Michael Maxwell, president of AFC Securities, Inc., a division of TheAssociates in Dallas, found that Computrol's MFS provided the flexibility andcustomization required to implement a complex Investment Deposit system.andO;This system processes debt securities, similar to certificates of deposit,and requires many regulatory reports.andP;  It is mainframe-based and has bothonline and batch components that handle approximately 17,000 customers and42,000 notes daily.andM;AFC Securities' MIS department originally planned to develop the systemin-house, but this was determined to be too costly and time-consuming.andP;  Thecompany decided to use packaged software and selected Computrol's MFS system.andM;&quot;The system is highly regarded by the data processing department, especiallysince it was up and running within nine months--both on time and underbudget,&quot; Maxwell said.andP;  &quot;If we develop a new product, we want to automate itquickly on the technical side.andP;  MFS allows us to bring the average product tomarket within three days.&quot;andP;  According to Maxwell, the system is easilymodifiable.andM;Automatic generation of source code from detailed specifications prepareddirectly from graphic specifications is the function of the MicroStep toolfrom Syscorp International of Austin, Tex.andP;  Within the MicroStep environment,the analyst can build the dataflow diagrams, specify the data structures, layout the screens, format the reports, and describe the applicable computationsand processing logic--all by means of mouse-driven graphics.andP;  At this point,100% C source code can be generated.andP;  The advantages to this are: the codecan be modified at the design specification level; and the documentation isup-to-date.andP;  The product also performs the compiles and links necessary toexecute the code.andP;  Programmers never have to touch the code; their work canbe done at the specification or design stage.andM;MANAGING TRADE FINANCINGandM;Nicholas Anzano of Midland International Trade Services, New York, needed toacquire software to manage specialized trade financing for large Fortune 500companies exporting from Mexico.andP;  In general, the system had to be able totrack inventory, as well as the funding for the inventory.andP;  It also had to beable to quickly accommodate new transactions.andM;Anzano was able to place icons on the screen signifying databases, screens,reports, flat files and procedures, thereby developing a very detaied,graphically represented set of specifications.andP;  The software checked that thespecifications were complete and logically correct.andP;  It then generated the Ccode, compiled and linked it, and produced an executable program.andP;  Accordingto Anzano, the 37 modules created thus far have been tested extensively andare error-free.andM;&quot;The front end of MicroStep is extraordinary in terms of time savings and thereusability of the code.andP;  Some of the same modules used for the import sidecan be used exactly as they are for the export side,&quot; he said.andP;  Without theuse of MicroStep, Anzano has determined that a project currently underwaywould require more than twice the time now estimated.andM;On the down side, the resource usage required by MicroStep is rather high andthe C code is unreadable, according to Anzano.andP;  The executable program isalso larger than if written directly, but Anzano said the trade-off in speedof development outweighs any negatives.andM;In the final analysis, these products, however sophisticated, are only toolsto supplement the programmer's effort.andP;  The key ingredients for successfulsystem maintenance are still experience and judgment.andM;Hanna is a freelance writer with over 20 years experience in programming andsystems management.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
