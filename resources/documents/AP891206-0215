BOLT</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Federal officials have broadened theirinvestigation into the dealings of former Vernon Savings and LoanAssociation owner Don D. Dixon, his attorney said Wednesday, thesame day the last of seven former officers of the thrift wasconvicted of soliciting kickbacks.   Attorney William M. Ravkind said he received a second letterWednesday notifying him Dixon is the target of a federalinvestigation.   Ravkind would not say what areas the Dallas Bank Fraud TaskForce was investigating, nor what a previous target letter hadoutlined. Prosecutors would not comment on the investigation.   Ravkind said he expected Dixon eventually would be indicted. ``Idon't have any way of knowing where this investigation is headed,(but) I don't think they'll bring anything until they've completedthe entire investigation,'' he said.   Dixon currently faces no criminal charges, although he is thelead defendant in a $540 million federal fraud lawsuit filed in1987. Ravkind said that suit is on hold pending the outcome of anycriminal investigation.   Earlier Wednesday, former Vernon Chairman Woody F. Lemons wasconvicted of soliciting $221,000 in kickbacks from Vernontransactions in 1985 and 1986.   Lemons is the seventh, and highest ranking, former Vernonofficial either to plead guilty to or be convicted of crimesstemming from their actions at the thrift, which was seized byfederal regulators in 1987 in a then-record bailout.   Lemons' conviction wraps all current outstanding cases connectedto Vernon, which frequently is cited as an example of some of theindustry's worst abuses.   He was convicted on 13 charges accusing him of soliciting a$9,000 kickback from a Plano loan broker in 1985 and receiving$212,000 from the broker in 1986.   U.S. District Court Judge Robert Maloney set sentencing for Jan.18. Lemons, who remained free on bond, could be sentenced to up to65 years in jail and fined as much as $500,000.   Prosecutor Robert Hauberg said the Dallas Bank Fraud Task Forceis continuing to investigate Vernon and other thrifts for possiblecharges.</TEXT></DOC>
