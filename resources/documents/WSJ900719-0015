Top congressional Democrats said they agreed withPresident Bush to strive for a fiscal 1991 deficit-reductionaccord in the next month, but they provided no reason foroptimism.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;No startling decisions were made,&quot; House Speaker ThomasFoley (D., Wash.) said after the White House session.   Mr. Foley said Democrats complained to the president abouta resolution approved yesterday by House Republicans thatopposes &quot;new taxes and all tax rate increases as a means ofreducing the federal budget deficit.&quot;   The speaker said it was &quot;unfortunate&quot; that Republicans&quot;approved a statement that repudiates the president,&quot; butadded that it wouldn't derail the summit. Other Democratsgave harsher assessments. House Ways and Means CommitteeChairman Dan Rostenkowski (D., Ill.) said, &quot;It certainly willhave a chilling effect on how the Democrats approach thesummit.&quot; Senate Finance Committee Chairman Lloyd Bentsen (D.,Texas), referring to the House Republicans, said, &quot;Thosepeople are living in a dream world.&quot;   Mr. Bush said he asked White House Budget Director RichardDarman to continue talks with House Majority Leader DickGephardt (D., Mo.) during the next few days. The budgetsummit hasn't met for a week, but Mr. Gephardt said he mayconvene a session as early as today. Congressional leadersare to meet again with Mr. Bush on Monday, the White Housesaid.   In the budget summit, negotiators are seeking a package oftax increases and spending cuts to reduce the deficit byabout $50 billion for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1.   Democrats have been working on a tax package inanticipation that the administration will soon offer one ofits own. Both the Democrats and the administration arelooking closely at a broad-based energy tax, particularly onethat levies a flat percentage on the prices of all types offuel.   Rep. Rostenkowski said in an interview with NBC Newsyesterday that &quot;there will be a general increase in energytaxes.&quot; Sen. Bentsen also spoke favorably about the energytax, saying in an interview that it &quot;does notdisproportionately hurt any single region.&quot; Sen. Bentsen saidsome way would have to be found to offset the regressivity ofsuch a tax.   Earlier, Bush administration officials had been pushing aso-called British Thermal Unit tax, which would have beenlevied on different energy sources based on the amount ofenergy they produce. But that approach has been criticized astoo complicated and as especially burdensome tocoal-producing regions. Congressional staffs are exploringways to raise between $12 billion and $15 billion a year froma price-based energy tax.   Shortly after his meeting with congressional leaders, Mr.Bush said aboard Air Force One: &quot;The deficit problem is soserious that there must be a bipartisan, responsible answer,and I will keep saying that.&quot;   But the House Republicans' resolution, drafted by Rep.Richard Armey (R., Texas), singles out Senate Majority LeaderGeorge Mitchell (D., Maine) for having &quot;abandoned the summitgoals and emerged as a consistent roadblock,&quot; and assertedthat he &quot;has championed tax increases at every turn.&quot;   Asked for his reaction, Sen. Mitchell smiled broadly andsaid, &quot;This is essentially a dispute between the HouseRepublicans and the president. I don't want to get involved.&quot;The senator reiterated his position that any accord requiressupport from a majority of both parties.   House Republican Leader Bob Michel said he urged Mr. Bushand the Democrats not to let the vote by his rank-and-fileinterfere with their objective. Another Republican budgetnegotiator, Minnesota Rep. Bill Frenzel, sought to play downthe significance of the vote, arguing, &quot;All it says is thatRepublicans oppose taxes. We've always opposed taxes.&quot;   Separately, the Senate Budget Committee voted 20-1 infavor of legislation offered by Sen. Ernest Hollings (D.,S.C.) that would exclude the Social Security surplus from thecalculation of the deficit under the Gramm-Rudman law. Thebill doesn't alter the deficit targets set in the law; Sen.Hollings said that was up to the budget summit.   ---   Greg Hitt contributed to this article.</TEXT></DOC>
