Employees at Kroger headquarters say they are relieved KohlbergKravis Roberts andamp; Co., which specializes in corporate takeovers,withdrew its $64-per-share buyout offer on Tuesday. But concernabout Kroger and their jobs remains.   ``I think we are going to make it, but it will still be tough,''said George Aulick of Kroger's management information systemsdepartment.   Dart Group Inc., of Landover, Md., began the bidding for Krogeron Sept. 19 with a $4.32 billion, $55-per-share offer. Dart has notimproved its offer but has not indicated whether it too waswithdrawing from the scene.   To thwart both buyout offers, Kroger has undertaken a $4.6billion corporate restructuring that includes the sale of some ofthe company's stores and food processing businesses. Last week,Kroger dismissed 300 of its approximately 800 headquartersemployees as part of the restructuring, in order to save $13million annually.   Aulick said he believes attempts to acquire the company will endbecause Kohlberg was unsuccessful in its bid for Kroger after athree-week effort. He noted that Kroger's stock price fell afterKohlberg withdrew, reflecting speculation that there would be nofurther buyout offers that might drive the price higher.   Kroger's stock fell $2.62{ a share to $55 in heavy tradingTuesday on the New York Stock Exchange, but closed $1 higher at $56on Wednesday.   But Kroger headquarters employee Bruce House said he thinksanother buyout attempt probably is looming.   ``I think attempts to take over the company will continue. Theclimate is ripe for them now and Kroger is a solid company, whichmakes it attractive,'' House said.   Kroger officials say the restructuring _ which will result in asmaller and more indebted company _ is a better deal forshareholders than the Kohlberg offer. Kroger shareholders will geta $40 a share special cash dividend, plus notes and stock in therestructured company.   A few Kroger employees were surprised, but not disappointed, byKohlberg's decision to withdraw.   ``I was happy but caught off guard,'' employee Pam Wurtzlersaid. ``We thought it was good the company's (Kroger) plan seems tohave worked.''   Company employees said they have not heard whether more firingswere planned. The remaining employees are concerned about theirfutures.   ``I have mixed emotions about everything,'' House said. ``It'sbeen so rough the last two weeks.''   After last week's firings, which many employees blamed onKohlberg's takeover attempt, there were few kind words for thebuyout specialists.   ``They made their money, they stripped the company, they didtheir damage, and now they're gone,'' Aulick said. ``I'm gladthey're gone. We're going to make it.''   The 105-year-old Kroger has about 170,000 employees and 52,000shareholders. The company's main businesses are its supermarketsand convenience stores, with operations in 29 states.   Kroger said Wednesday it has received Federal Trade Commissionapproval to sell 24 Florida Choice supermarkets and 24 FloridaChoice liquor stores, all located in Florida, to the Kash N' Karryfirm for $55 million. The transaction is to be completed by Friday.</TEXT></DOC>
