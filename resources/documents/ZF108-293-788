 Butdesktop color reproduction involves a more elaborate scenario.andP;  Intraditional publishing, film is used at each step -- a photograph is taken,retouched, stripped, cropped, placed in a layout, and color-separated.andP;  Withdesktop publishing, computer files replace the film in much of the process,with standards such as Adobe's PostScript and OPI (the Aldus-sponsored OpenPrepress Interface) providing the links.andP;  But while computers allow for adegree of precision never before possible, color publishing remains a jobbest handled by skilled professionals.andM;The Scanner's RoleandM;The quality of the scanner used at the input stage is crucial.andP;  If thescanner fails to capture enough information from the scanned image, theimage-processing software and separation utilities cannot entirely compensatefor the loss.andP;  Fortunately, scanners sensitive enough to provide the fulltonal range required for quality reproduction are now being introduced bysuch companies as Barneyscan, Howtek, Nikon, Sharp, and Truvel.andM;Scanners convert the light reflected from a photograph into numbers acomputer can manipulate.andP;  Desktop scanners use a silicon chip called acharge-coupled device, or CCD, to measure the light.andP;  When exposed to light,thousands of tiny elements in the CCD emit electrical charges correspondingto the light's intensity.andP;  The higher the number of elements in a scanner'sCCD array, the higher the resolution of its images.andM;Scanners vary in quality according to their resolution (dots per inch, ordpi) and their dynamic range (bits of color captured per pixel).andP;  How muchresolution you need depends on the size of your original image and outputimage and the screen frequency you require for color separations.andP;  For colorseparations, you should scan at twice your intended screen frequency tocompensate for the information lost when the image is printed as a mosaic ofdots, called a halftone.andM;The scanners discussed here have a dynamic range of 24 bits of color perpixel, which translates to 16.8 million distinct colors -- more than enoughto capture the image on a color slide.andM;There are complications, however.andP;  In theory, these scanners capture 8 bitsof color in each of three passes over an image, scanning for the red, green,and blue components.andP;  In reality, they are able to capture only 6 bits.andP;  As aresult, either the dark areas go black or the light areas go white.andP;  And ifyou boost the image's brightness after scanning, you lose even more detail inthe light areas.andM;Scanners: Flatbed and SlideandM;The desktop-color-scanner market is divided into flatbed (reflective-copy)scanners and slide (transparency) scanners.andP;  Flatbed scanners typically scanflat art of up to 11 X 17 inches at 300 dpi and 8 bits of data per colorchannel.andP;  Some newer models scan at 600 dpi and 12 bits of data per color for8-bit color accuracy.andP;  Flatbed scanners often have optional mirrorattachments that let you scan transparencies, including 35mm slides (scans ofslides are often blurry, however).andM;Flatbed scanners have definite problems providing enough tonal range forquality separation in the output stage.andP;  Scanning a slide at 300 dpi renderstoo little detail.andP;  Slide scanners provide extremely high resolution,considering the size of the 35mm original, but the resolution is stillborderline for full-page color separation.andM;Making CompromisesandM;A printing press can reproduce many fewer colors than are possible within atransparency.andP;  Certain characteristics of transparencies can be adjustedduring the scanning process so that the image reproduced on the printingpress best resembles the original photograph.andP;  The art of scanning a colorphotograph involves knowing what comprises have to be made and how best toapply them while still retaining the true colors of the original as much aspossible.andM;Along with color-craft knowledge, operating a scanner requires a certaintechnical expertise.andP;  Color scanners require continual calibration to ensurethat the scanner light, mechanics, focus, and filters are adjusted so thatthe color components will be separated correctly.andP;  When checking outscanners, remember to examine the controlling software as well as thetechnical specifications of the scanner itself.andM;Controlling the ScanandM;There are basically two types of scanning software: image-capture software,which controls the scanner and image modification, and processing software,which we'll address in the next section.andP;  The current trend is towarddual-purpose software that allows you to adjust the scanning parameters andthen scan and modify the image.andP;  Some scanner manufacturers provide their ownprocessing software or a copy of an off-the-shelf package such as Avalon'sPhotoMac or Adobe's Photoshop.andP;  Otherwise, you have to buy your ownprocessing software, which may be preferable anyway.andM;The key at this stage, though, is having control of your scanner.andP;  Forquality images, you want to create a scan that looks good from the start.andP;  Toachieve this, you'll need software with flexible scanning controls.andP;  When youevaluate scanners, look for the following features:andM;Resolution.andP;  You don't always want or need the maximum resolution yourscanner can provide.andP;  You should be able to choose other resolutions, both tokeep file sizes down and to fine-tune scans for special situations.andM;Scan area.andP;  Often you'll want to scan only a portion of an image, either tokeep the file size down or as a means of cropping the picture.andP;  Most scannersoftware lets you do a quick preview scan and then draw a box around the areayou want to capture -- an approach that seems to work well.andM;Disk space and memory.andP;  Some scanning software tells you how much space isrequired for an image before you scan it and whether or not you have enoughspace to complete the scan.andP;  Some software cannot capture an image biggerthan available RAM, whereas other programs use available disk space tocapture larger images.andM;Scaling.andP;  If you know in advance what size your final image should be, it'suseful to be able to scale, or resize, the image during scanning.andP;  The trickis not to scale an image to a larger size than what you will eventually use.andO;If you use scaling and resolution control, you stand a much better chance ofcapturing enough information for making separations later.andM;Brightness and contrast.andP;  You should adjust brightness and contrast beforescanning an image, rather than after.andP;  When you use image-editing software tochange the brightness and contrast, you lose information as you decreasecertain values.andM;For more sophisticated adjustment of contrast and brightness, you can use amethod called gamma correction.andP;  Scanners save color information on astraight 1-to-1 basis, but the amount of information needed to interpret adark area is greater than the amount of information needed to interpret alight one.andP;  To solve this problem, the information is saved on a curve, withmore information stored on the dark end of the scale with gamma correction.andO;Instead of using a linear slider to adjust contrast and brightness, you editthe contrast/brightness curve before scanning (see Figures 1 and 2).andM;Shrinking Files While You ScanandM;Color scans tend to produce large files--at maximum resolution, Nikon's slidescanner LS-3500 produces a 75-megabyte file, for example.andP;  And as scannersimprove, the files will get larger.andP;  Larger files have greater spatial andcolor resolution, giving you more detail and more room for imagemanipulation.andP;  Although file-compression utilities such as StuffIt and itscommercial version, StuffIt Deluxe, may help when you're transferring imagesfrom system to system, on-the-fly compression and decompression techniqueswill be required to effectively work with color images.andM;In on-the-fly compression, images are automatically compressed every time youstore them and automatically decompressed whenever) you want to view them.andO;It usually requires a combination of software and customized computer chipsthat assist in compression and decompression at high speed.andP;  Electronics ForImaging (EFI) produces developer software called ECOMP that does on-the-flycompression by deleting redundant data that the eye won't miss in thedecompressed image.andP;  The software's adaptive algorithms scan the input image,filtering and preserving its tonal data, color data, and spatial-acuityattributes.andM;We now have the tools for input at our disposal.andP;  The next job is to learnhow to use them properly--how to set them up, how to maintain them, and howto capture a good image with the resolution and tonal range required forfour-color process separations.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
