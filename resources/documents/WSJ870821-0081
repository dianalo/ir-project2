The bank said it expects to report a 450 million Canadian dollar ($338.3 million) after-tax charge for its third quarter ended July 31 because of the increased loan-loss reserves. To comply with new federal bank guidelines, Canadian Imperial raised its reserves for loans to less-developed countries by 850 million dollars to a total 1.3 billion dollars during the quarter.    Donald Bowder, a senior vice president of the bank, said the charge &quot;is going to result in a loss for the quarter, but it will be a lesser loss for the year.&quot; The bank, Canada's third-largest, is expected to report its quarterly results next week.    In its year-ago third quarter the bank had a profit of 82.7 million dollars, or 54 cents a share. In the year ended Oct. 31 it reported a profit of 341.2 million dollars, or 2.31 dollars a share.    All of Canada's six major domestic banks are expected to report sizable losses for their third quarters because of the government's increased loan-loss reserve requirements. As previously reported, the government ordered banks to raise their reserves on loans to 34 less-developed countries to between 30% and 40% of the total 25 billion dollars outstanding. Prior to the third quarter, the banks had reserves for about 15% of the loans.    Canadian Imperial said for the third quarter it increased its reserves to the countries to 40% of its total 3.3 billion dollars of loans outstanding.    In trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange yesterday, the bank's stock closed at 22.625 dollars, up 12.5 cents. The bank's expected third-quarter charge was announced after the trading close. </TEXT></DOC>
