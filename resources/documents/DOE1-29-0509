Stationswere selected along three important bayous of the Calcasieu River system.Distributions of some of these metals in the organisms were similar tothose found in sediments from the same locations, while those of othermetals appeared to be similar to metal concentrations in water. Concentrationratios for periphyton to sediment greatly exceeded one for the metalsAs, Cd, Cr, Ag, and Zn, suggesting enrichment of these metals in periphyton.The concentrations of heavy metals in the periphyton appeared to yieldmore information about pollutants than either water or sediment samplescollected at the periphyton stations.</TEXT></DOC>
