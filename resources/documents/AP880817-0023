The decline next year will occur partly because fewer hogs andfewer ``non-fed'' cattle, those that are not sent to feedlotsbefore slaughtering, will be going to market next year, USDA says.It says that will mean further increases in consumer meat prices.   ``While per capita meat consumption is likely to decline fromthe 1988 record, it will remain above the large levels of1985-87,'' the department's Economic Research Service said Tuesdayin a new outlook report.   The 1988 supply of red meat and poultry is at a record level,rising to more than 60 billion pounds, a 3 percent increase fromlast year, the report said.   But production next year is expected to drop 1 percent to lessthan 59.2 billion pounds. All of the decline will come at theexpense of red meat, while poultry output is forecast to gain 4percent.   Beef production, forecast at 21.6 billion pounds in 1989, isexpected to drop 6 percent, while pork, at 15.5 billion pounds, maydecline only 1 percent. Lamb and mutton production is expected torise 2 percent to 335 million pounds, while no change is forecastfor veal production, estimated at 400 million pounds.   Retail prices for Choice-grade beef may go up 1 percent to 3percent in 1989, following this year's estimated rise of 3 percentto 4 percent, the report said. Pork prices are expected to go up 3percent to 4 percent in 1989 after declining 3 percent this year.   Wholesale broiler prices are forecast to average in a range of51 to 57 cents per pound, compared with 53 to 56 cents this year.Turkey prices, at 68 to 74 cents, are expected to increase fromthis year's wholesale average of 61 to 64 cents.   The report said the U.S. cattle and calf inventory on July 1 wasdown 1 percent from a year ago. This year's calf crop, estimated at40.2 million head, is up only slightly from 1987 but is still thesecond-lowest since 1961.   During the first half of this year, 10 percent more heiferscalved and entered the cow herd than in the same period of 1987,``suggesting that the cattle inventory may begin to stabilize in1989-90,'' the report said.   ``Beef cow slaughter during January-July was 9 percent below ayear ago, while dairy cow slaughter was down 3 percent,'' thereport added. ``However, drought-reduced forage supplies and higherfeed costs may delay expansion.''   Beef output may drop 1 percent this year as expanded productionby feedlots partially offsets reduced production of non-fed beef.   ``In 1989, beef output is expected to drop 6 percent as non-fedslaughter remains low and reduced feeder cattle supplies result inlower fed cattle slaughter,'' the report said.   Prices paid for Choice-grade steers on the Omaha, Neb., marketwere at record highs this spring and may average $69 per 100 poundsof liveweight for the year, compared with $64.60 in 1987.   ``Reduced supplies in 1989 may boost prices $4 to $6 perhundredweight above 1988,'' the report added.   Higher feed costs and lower hog prices are forcing porkproducers to cut back from this year. Even so, analysts said 1989output still may be up 8 percent from 1987.   Hog prices at the major markets may average about $44 perhundredweight this year, down from nearly $52 in 1987l. Prices in1989 may average in the range of $44 to $50.   ``Despite higher feed costs, broiler production remainsprofitable and is expected to rise 4 percent in 1989, about thesame as this year,'' the report said. ``Poor returns since mid-1987and higher feed costs may slow turkey production increases to 1percent in 1989, following gains of 19 percent and 5 percent in1987 and 1988.''   Egg production may decline about 1 percent in 1989, following a2 percent cutback this year.</TEXT></DOC>
