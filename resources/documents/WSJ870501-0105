At a House Ways and Means Committee hearing, Mr. Gould asked lawmakers to approve an increase in the borrowing ceiling by May 15 to either $2.8 trillion, an amount that would last through May 1989, or $2.578 trillion, a level adequate for fiscal 1988, which ends Sept. 30, 1988. Unless Congress acts, the current debt ceiling of $2.3 trillion will revert to $2.111 trillion after May 15.    Mr. Gould said he preferred the first option to avoid having to deal with a debt limit in the middle of an election campaign.    He emphasized that the administration wants a debt-ceiling bill without amendments. All sorts of unrelated measures are typically attached to debt-ceiling bills, which must be passed for the government to continue functioning. This year, lawmakers are expected to try to add amendments to restore the automatic-cut mechanism in the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law.    In calling for prompt action, Mr. Gould stressed the dire consequences of running out of cash. He said the fact that the debt level will decline, rather than merely fail to rise, if Congress doesn't act makes the situation more critical than it has been in recent years.    On May 16, he said, the debt subject to the ceiling would be about $160 billion over the $2.111 trillion limit. As a result, the Treasury wouldn't be able to issue public debt securities, roll over maturing issues or raise cash. In addition, sales of savings bonds to the public and special nonmarketable securities to state and local governments would stop.    On May 28, the Treasury would be unable to redeem maturing securities and subsequently wouldn't be able to make benefits payments, such as social security.    In a budget crunch last year, the Treasury was able to manipulate the debt of government trust funds to allow enough additional borrowing to pay civil service retirement benefits. But Mr. Gould said that when debt substantially exceeds the limits, as it will after May 15, the government wouldn't be able to use such a maneuver. </TEXT></DOC>
