The deal covers $20.5 billion of this oil-producing nation's $26billion public-sector debt. The country owes about $35 billion inpublic- and private- sector debt.   Cutting the debt has been a major goal of the 19-month-oldgovernment of President Carlos Andres Perez. He has saidconsistently that this once-wealthy nation is now too poor to payon loans contracted over two decades of boom times.   Debt-cutting negotiations began early last year under theumbrella of U.S. Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady's plan to easethe burden of Third World nations.   Officials said more than 90 percent of a total 400 creditorbanks have chosen from a list of five debt-cutting options offeredby Venezuela.   The most popular options were the exchange of Venezuelan debtfor low-interest, 30-year U.S.-guaranteed bonds, and the loaning offresh funds to Venezuela.   Least popular was the option that Venezuela had pushed thehardest: allowing Venezuela to buy back debt on the secondarymarket at about 41 percent of its value.   Although one option allows banks to recapture more funds if theprice of oil rises, officials said the income earned from high oilprices would far outweigh possible givebacks to the banks.</TEXT></DOC>
