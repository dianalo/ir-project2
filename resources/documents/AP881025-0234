He estimated the number of securities industry layoffsnationwide, which reached more than 15,000 in the months followingthe October 1987 crash, could hit 25,000 by the end of this year,or about 9.6 percent of the total 260,000.   Worried about a continued slump in stock trading, Shearson laidoff about 200 people earlier this month and expects the total toreach 1,000 by year's end, officials of the brokerage said Monday.   Shearson already has accounted for about one-third ofcrash-related layoffs, largely because of its acquisition of thedistressed E.F. Hutton Group Inc. late last year for nearly $1billion.   But the company last week hinted at further reductions in itsstaff of 42,000 employees, when it reported an 85 percent tumble inits third-quarter profit.   Shearson officials said the latest round of layoffs would affectall operations, but it was clear that retail brokerage would beaffected most. Analysts said that side of the business requires alot more support staff, such as computer operators and billingclerks, than other areas.   On the other hand, financing takeover deals, the most frenziedpart of the investment business, requires relatively few people andis the most profitable.   ``What you've got here is a one-legged man,'' said James P.Hanbury, who follows the industry for Wertheim Schroder andamp; Co., aNew York investment firm. ``Mandamp;A is red hot, while most other linesof business are the opposite.''   Shearson, the second biggest U.S. brokerage behind Merrill Lynchandamp; Co., has become an aggressive financier of corporate takeoversand restructurings.   It is adviser to management of RJR Nabisco Inc., which surprisedWall Street last week by announcing it might try to buy thefood-tobacco conglomerate for $17 billion in a leveraged buyout.   Shearson would reap staggering profits if the management buyoutsucceeded, although the investment firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp;Co. entered the fray Monday with a $20.28 billion bid.   Shearson also has played key roles in other huge takeover dealsover the past year. It represented Eastman Kodak Co. in a $5.1billion takeover of Sterling Drug Co.; it advised FederatedDepartment Stores, target of an intense bidding war won by Canadiandeveloper Robert Campeau, who paid $6.58 billion; and it helpedtakeover strategest Paul Bilzerian buy Singer Co. for $1 billion.   Figures compiled by IDD Information Services, an investmentindustry research and publishing concern in New York, show Shearsonranked first during the first half of this year in number oftakeover deals, at 105.   IDD said Shearson ranked fourth in terms of the dollar value ofthese deals at $41.95 billion, behind Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co. at$44.94 billion, Morgan Stanley Group Inc. at $45.42 billion andFirst Boston Inc. at $54.92 billion.   ``Shearson's like any of us, we take advantage of ouropportunities,'' said Long. ``The LBO game and Mandamp;A business havebeen going at a furious pace, and as a consequence, the firm'sattention is being diverted to areas where it can make money.''   Some Wall Street professionals noted the irony that Shearson,which used a major post-crash advertising blitz to urge a long-terminvestment strategy, was diverting its own resources to speculativedeal-making.   Others called Shearson's strategy a necessary adjustment forlong-term survival.   ``It's like General Motors cutting back on Caddies during adownturn and hiring people in the Chevrolet division,'' said Long.</TEXT></DOC>
