This doesn't mean women should light up, because the decreasedrisk is outweighed by health harm from smoking, researchers said.   The study does provide new evidence, however, that the femalehormone estrogen plays a role in colorectal cancer, they said.   Previous studies suggested smoking interferes with estrogenfunction and that estrogen levels might be linked to the risk ofcolorectal cancer. Better understanding of estrogen's role couldlead to new treatments, researchers say.   For the new study, researchers looked back at the records of25,369 white women whose smoking status was known in 1963 to seehow many had developed colorectal cancer by 1975.   The colorectal cancer risk for 4,338 smokers who were 65 orolder in 1963 was estimated to be 42 percent of that of theirnonsmoking counterparts. Smokers younger than 55 ran an elevatedrisk.   The work is reported in the Oct. 19 Journal of the NationalCancer Institute by researchers from the Johns Hopkins UniversitySchool of Hygiene and Public Health in Hagerstown, Md., theUniversity of North Carolina School of Medicine in Chapel Hill andthe National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences in ResearchTriangle Park, N.C.</TEXT><HEAD>Children of Diabetic Mothers May Get Partial Protection From</HEAD><TEXT>   Diabetes</TEXT><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Children of diabetic mothers may have someprotection against developing diabetes themselves because of theirexposure to the mother before birth, a study suggests.   Their immune systems may be affected before birth in a way thatmakes them less likely to develop diabetes than children ofdiabetic fathers are, the study's authors say.   The study dealt with insulin-dependent diabetes _ the kind thatrequires daily insulin shots.   Children of diabetic mothers run a higher diabetes risk thanthose of normal mothers, but by one estimate they are only aquarter as likely to develop diabetes as are children of diabeticfathers.   Until recent decades, children of diabetic mothers were morelikely to be stillborn or die as newborns than were children ofdiabetic fathers. Some researchers had speculated the early deathsmay have culled out children who would later have developeddiabetes, thus lowering the diabetes rate among survivors.   But the new study found no support for that speculation, becauseit showed that the rate of such early deaths in 1,602 pregnancieswas unrelated to the diabetes rate in the survivors.   Researchers cited an alternative explanation for the lowereddiabetes rate. Insulin-dependent diabetes occurs when the body'sdisease-fighting immune system attacks insulin-producing cells ofthe pancreas. Perhaps something in a diabetic mother enables thefetal immune system to avoid such an attack, the researchers say.   The study was done by James Warram, Andrzej Krolewski and C.Ronald Kahn of Boston's Joslin Diabetes Center and was published inthe October issue of the journal Diabetes.</TEXT><HEAD>Tubes Or Not Ear Tubes, That Is the Question</HEAD><DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   New studies cast doubt on the value ofsurgically installed ear tubes to relieve fluid buildup in childrenwith middle-ear infections.   The surgery, which costs about $1,000, has surpassedtonsillectomy as the most common operation on U.S. children. Butpediatricians are divided about the operation's safety.   ``The adverse consequences may be significant compared totreatment with antibiotics,'' Dr. Michael Pichichero, of theUniversity of Rochester, N.Y., said during the recent 28thInterscience Conference on Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy.   He studied more than 100 children, about half of whom receivedsix or more treatements with antibiotics and half of whom hadreceived three or more sets of ear tubes for recurrent middle-earinfections.   Roughly 50 percent of the ear-tube group experienced somehearing loss _ a worrisome consequence of middle-ear infections.Less than 5 percent of the antibiotic group showed hearing loss.Pichicherio doesn't yet know whether the hearing loss will bepermanent. The ear-tube group also suffered eardrum damage far moreoften.   Doctors at Hadassah University Hospital in Jerusalem, Israel,treated 105 babies under age 1, using antibiotics, ear tubes orboth. After 10 days, they found infection persisted in 63 percentof the babies who had surgery, 11 percent of the babies whoreceived antibiotics and 13 percent of the babies who got bothtreatments.   However, there are cases in which there is no alternative to eartubes, including those where children are allergic or unresponsiveto antibiotics, or have had fluid in an ear for three or moremonths, Dr. Charles Bluestone, a Pittsburgh ear-nose-throatspecialist, said during the recent American Academy of Pediatricsmeeting in San Francisco.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Nov. 3</NOTE></DOC>
