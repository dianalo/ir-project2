The desire for a continued U.S. presence highlightsSeoul's current strategic thinking: North Korea is a realthreat now, but there is also much to fear from Japan in thefuture.</LP><TEXT>   Military and strategic planners in Seoul envision keepingabout 20,000 U.S. troops on the Korean peninsula. &quot;Thedifferent {policy} communities in South Korea believe thateven if {the two Koreas} reunify we would still ask the U.S.to remain.&quot; says Kim Kook Chin, dean of research at theForeign Ministry's Institute for Foreign Affairs and NationalSecurity.   Seoul's outspoken fear of Japan is all the more surprisingbecause relations between the two countries have beenfriendly. Japan, a democracy that holds to a pacifist foreignpolicy, has been helping South Korea in persuading NorthKorea to come out of its self-imposed isolation. The two holdregular consultations.   But a Ministry of Defense white paper issued last monthwarned of a military buildup in Japan, which it said wasshifting from a defense-only orientation. Cha Young Koo,director of the policy-planning office for the government'sKorea Institute of Defense Analysis, says Japan is a moreworrisome threat than China, which invaded South Korea duringthe Korean War. &quot;U.S. troops would be a guarantee against themilitaristic policies of Japan,&quot; says Mr. Cha.   Planning the endgame of possible confrontation on theKorean peninsula and the U.S. military's role in that phaseare likely to be major topics at the annual U.S.-Koreasecurity consultations this week in Seoul, where U.S.Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney and Gen. Colin Powell,chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, will meet with DefenseMinister Lee Jong Koo and South Korean generals.   North Korean nuclear capabilities are still considered thegreatest regional threat. The military leaders will also talkabout Seoul increasing its share of the cost of keeping U.S.troops in South Korea, as well as defense-technology transferand procurement of more sophisticated weapons, such as thePatriot missile system to protect against the North's Scudmissiles.   But the dominant issue is likely to be the U.S. role inNorth Asia. The two sides are expected to announce cuts of atleast 6,000 U.S. troops beginning in 1993 from the 36,000remaining. About 7,000 troops are being cut this year andnext under a previously announced reduction.   &quot;The key words are that the U.S. will play a supportiverole and South Korea will play the lead role,&quot; said a SouthKorean government official who deals with security matters.&quot;Two years ago we would have said the U.S. role is to deterthe North Koreans,&quot; says Kim Chong Whi, assistant to thepresident for foreign and national security affairs. &quot;Now wesee it as two roles: providing regional peace anddeterrence.&quot;   The question South Koreans worry about -- with goodhistorical reason -- is what happens if the U.S. withdraws asthe region's major peace keeper. &quot;The new world order isstill not clear in Asia,&quot; says the South Korean nationalsecurity expert. &quot;Who will play that role? I don't see anyoneelse.&quot;   That is certainly not a position the South Koreans wouldassign to Japan, which brutally occupied Korea for 40 yearsuntil the end of World War II. &quot;It is very difficult forKorea to play a close military role with Japan,&quot; says Mr.Cha, the government military analyst.   South Koreans fear the growing might of Japan, althoughthe island nation has less than 40% of South Korea's militarymanpower. Japan does outspend South Korea three to one ondefense and is almost its equal in military hardware.   South Korean officials also contend that Japan fears theeconomic and military potential of a unified Korea andtherefore wants to perpetuate its division. Howeverill-founded or invalid these attitudes may be, experts saythey will force the U.S. to continue playing peace keeper.   &quot;Cultural antagonism and misplaced fear could sparktensions,&quot; says Michael J. Mazarr, of the Center forStrategic and International Studies in Washington. &quot;Theburden of avoiding such a tragic result will fall largely onthe U.S.&quot; He says that security treaties with both Tokyo andSeoul, and in particular troop commitment, would help theU.S. mediate any disputes and relieve tensions.   The South Korean military now feels capable of resisting athreat from North Korea, despite the North's numericalsuperiority. &quot;The U.S. troops are important now, not becausethe North Korean threat is more dangerous,&quot; says Mr. Cha, butbecause the U.S. guarantees that the {reunification} processgoes well.&quot;   North Korea, which has resisted letting outsiders inspectits nuclear facilities because of the presence of U.S. troopsacross the border, will continue on that tack, according tothe South's strategic planners. &quot;Their ultimate goal is thesevering of the {South Korean-U.S.} alliance,&quot; says Lee DongBok, special assistant to the South Korean prime minister.But both the U.S. and South Korea say they will resist usingU.S. troops as a bargaining chip to gain concessions fromNorth Korea.</TEXT></DOC>
