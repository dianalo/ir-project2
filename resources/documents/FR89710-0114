The entire effort is now finished; however, each phase ofthe effort was published in the <T4> Federal Register </T4> upon completion. To ensure that the NASA publishedversion of the NFS and Code of Federal Regulations version comport, theentire NFS is hereby republished in the <T4> Federal Register </T4>as the 1989 edition.  No substantive modifications have been made in the existing codified bodyof regulations. The only changes are editorial in nature, such as correctionof typographical errors, repagination and resolution of minor discrepanciesattendant to any large publishing effort. The new loose-leaf 1989 Edition of the NASA FAR Supplement, including subsequentamendments, is available to the public and NASA contractors on a subscriptionbasis from the Superintendent of Documents, Government Printing Office(GPO), Washington, DC 20402. It is not available directly from NASA. <ITAG tagnum="84">Impact </ITAG>The Director, Office of Management and Budget (OMB), by memorandum datedDecember 14, 1984, exempted certain agency procurement regulations fromExecutive Order 12291. The regulation herein is in the exempted category,as there are no changes in aspects of the regulation to which the exemptionis inapplicable. Since there are no substantive changes, NASA certifiesthat this regulation, like the previous (1984 Edition) version, will nothave a significant economic effect on a substantial number of small entitiesunder the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.). The regulationmakes no changes in burdens on the public nor does it make any regulatorychanges in those parts subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act which bearcurrent OMB approval numbers 2700-0003, 2700-0004, 2700-0017, 2700-0051,2700-0052, 2700-0054, 2700-0055, and 2700-0056.   <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 48 CFR Ch. 18 </ITAG>Government procurement. <ITAG tagnum="6">S.

the NationalAeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Federal Acquisition Regulation(FAR) Supplement including purpose, authority, applicability, issuance,arrangement, numbering, dissemination, implementation, supplementation,maintenance, administration, and deviation.     <ITAG tagnum="52">Subpart 1801.1_Purpose, Authority, Issuance </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="80">1801.101 </ITAG><ITAG

tagnum="89">Authority. </ITAG>Under the following authorities, the Administrator has delegated to theAssistant Administrator for Procurement authority to prepare, issue, andmaintain the NASA FAR Supplement: (a) The National Aeronautics and Space Act of 1958, as amended (Pub. L.85-568; 42 U.S.C. 2451 et seq.). (b) 10 U.S.C. 137. (c) Other statutory authority. (d) FAR Subpart 1.3. <ITAG tagnum="80">1801.103 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Applicability. </ITAG>The NASA FAR Supplement applies to all acquisitions as defined in FAR Part2 except those expressly excluded by the FAR or this regulation. <ITAG tagnum="80">1801.104 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Issuance. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="80">1801.104-1 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Publication and code arrangement. </ITAG>(a) The NASA FAR Supplement is published in_(1) The daily issue of the <T4>Federal Register</T4>; (2) Cumulated form in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR); and (3) A separate loose-leaf edition adaptable for either interleaving withthe FAR or filing separately. (b) The NASA FAR Supplement is issued as Chapter 18 of Title 48, CFR, andit parallels the FAR in format, arrangement, and numbering system. Thus,a formal citation to this paragraph would appear as 48 CFR 1801.104-1(b).<ITAG tagnum="80">1801.104-2 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Arrangement of regulations. </ITAG>(a) <T3>General. </T3>The NASA FAR Supplement conforms to the arrangement andnumbering system prescribed by FAR 1.104. The numbering illustrations atFAR 1.104-2(b) apply to the NASA FAR Supplement; users are reminded thatin the loose-leaf edition of the supplement, NASA's assigned CFR chapternumber 18 appears to the left of the part number, separated by a hyphen(e.g., 1815.402-1). However, in 48 CFR Chapter 18 the hyphen does not appear;therefore the first four digits preceding the point refer to the CFR partnumber. (b) <T3>Numbering. </T3>(1) All NASA FAR Supplement coverage that supplements,as opposed to implementing, the FAR uses part, subpart, section, and subsectionnumbers 70 through 89 (see 1801.303-70): (i) Part 1870 is the first part number NASA can use for adding coveragethat supplements the FAR; i.e., there is no appropriate subject headingwithin the 53 parts of the FAR under which the coverage could be located.(ii) Subpart 1815.70 is the first subpart number NASA can use to supplementFAR Part 15. (iii) Section 1815.470 is the first section number NASA can use to supplementFAR Subpart 15.4. (iv) Subsection 1815.402-70 is the first subsection number NASA can useto supplement FAR section 15.402. (v) Subsection 1815.402-170 is the first subsection number NASA can useto supplement FAR subsection 15.402-1. (2) All NASA FAR Supplement coverage other than that identified with a70 or higher number, as described in subparagraph (b)(1) of this section,implements the FAR and bears the identical number and title of the FARsegment being implemented down to the subsection level; e.g., 1815.402-1implements FAR 15.402-1. Below the subsection level, NASA FAR Supplementalphanumerics do not correlate with FAR alphanumerics. (c) <T3>References and citations. </T3>(1) Unless otherwise stated, cross referencesare to parts or subdivisions of this regulation. (2) This regulation may be referred to as the National Aeronautics andSpace Administration Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement, the NASAFAR Supplement, or, for the purpose of brevity, the NFS. (3) A NFS ``version'' is the basic NFS with all NFSD change pages filedup to and including the NFSD number that corresponds to the ``version''number. For example, for the 1989 edition of the NFS, Version 89.3 consistsof pages from NFSDs 89-0 (basic NFS), with change pages filed from NFSDs89-1, 89-2, and 89-3. (4) Citations are assumed to mean the ``current NFS''; however, if referenceto other than the current document is intended, use of the identifyingversion number appearing on the cover is advisable.

(1) The statute does not delineate those policies and procedures that willhave a significant effect beyond the internal operating procedures of theagency or have a significant cost or administrative impact. Examples ofpolicies or procedures that fall in either of these categories are givenin paragraphs (b)(1) (i) through (iv) of this section. This list is notall inclusive and does not prohibit the agency from publicizing a policyor procedure that does not fall within one of the categories mandated bythe statute. (i) A contract clause requiring contractors to take precautions to avoidinjury to Florida manatees, which have been designated as an endangeredspecies, has a significant cost impact for contractors who must obtainprotective devices for boat propellers and take other safety actions. (ii) A contract clause requiring contractors to follow the Government'sholiday schedule, thereby disallowing premium pay for work on contractor-designatedholidays, will have an effect outside the internal operating proceduresof the agency. (iii) A contract clause requiring contractors to segregate costs by appropriationswill affect the contractor's internal accounting system and have a significantimpact. (iv) Requiring contractor compliance with NASA's Space Transportation SystemPersonnel Reliability Program will have an effect outside the internaloperating procedures of the agency.

In certain limited situations, it maybe appropriate to designate non-GS/GM-1102 or 1105 personnel as contractingofficers. The authority to obligate appropriated funds for the procurementof supplies and services may be delegated to non-GS/GM-1102 or 1105 personnel;provided all of the conditions in (a)(1) (i) through (iv) of this sectionare met: (i) A contracting officer warrant must be issued to the non-GS/GM-1102or 1105 individual. The warrant must include a specific dollar limitationset as low as possible. This limitation shall not exceed the small purchasethreshold in effect at the time of the delegation. Specific dollar limitationswell below the small purchase threshold should normally be sufficient andare encouraged. The warrant may include further limitations, such as thetypes of supplies or services that may be acquired. (ii) Only the procurement officer at each installation is authorized toissue or terminate contracting officer warrants to non-GS/GM-1102 or 1105personnel. This authority is nondelegable. (iii) Contracting officer warrants for non-GS/GM-1102 or 1105 personnelmay be issued only for small purchase procedures (FAR Part 13 and NFS Part1813). These procedures include executing purchase orders and modificationsto purchase orders. Authority to issue or sign contracts, unilateral orbilateral contract modifications of any amount, or orders above the smallpurchase threshold on Federal Supply Schedules is not delegable to non-GS/GM-1102or 1105 personnel. (iv) The selection, appointment, and termination procedures in 1801.603shall be followed. In particular, the education, training, and experiencerequirements for a basic-level contracting officer (see 1801.603-2(e))must be met before a warrant is issued. The experience requirement at 1801.603-2(e)(1)(i)(A)may be obtained either within a procurement office or in an office thatotherwise does procurement work. For example, a training specialist mayacquire the experience requirement by preparing in the installation's personneloffice purchase orders for training that will be signed by a warrantedcontracting officer. (2) The responsibility for monitoring the procurements made by non-GS/GM-1102or 1105 contracting officers remains with the procurement officer who issuestheir warrants. The procurement officer is responsible for ensuring thata system is in place that provides for general oversight of the continuedneed for each specific warrant and periodic review of the quality of theprocurement actions taken. These reviews shall be made no less frequentlythan semiannually. (3) Examples of contracting officer designations that may be appropriatefor non-GS/GM-1102 or 1105 personnel are the authorization to the installation'straining officer to sign purchase orders for off-the-shelf training coursesunder a certain dollar amount, or to the installation's librarian to placeorders up to $X for magazine subscriptions. (4) The requirements for imprest funds are established by the NASA FinancialManagement Manual; use of imprest funds does not require contracting officerwarrants or authority. (5) The term ``ordering officer'' is not authorized for use in delegatingprocurement functions to non-GS/GM-1102 or 1105 personnel. (b) <T3>Delegations to contracting officer's technical representatives (COTRs).</T3>A COTR delegation may be made only by the contracting officer cognizantof that contract at the time the delegation is made. If the cognizant contractingofficer is absent, the delegation letter may be signed by a warranted contractingofficer at any level above the cognizant contracting officer. An individualCOTR may have only the duties specifically identified in a written delegationto him or her by name (i.e., COTR duties may not be delegated to a position)and has no authority to exceed them. COTRs should be informed that theymay be personally liable for unauthorized commitments. Contracting officerauthority to sign or authorize contractual instruments shall not be delegatedthrough a COTR designation or by any means other than a contracting officerwarrant. However, delegations may be made to construction contract COTRsto sign emergency change orders with an estimated value not to exceed $2,500on-site at construction sites. <ITAG tagnum="52">Subpart 1801.7_Determinations and Findings</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="80">1801.703 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Class determinations and findings. </ITAG>The effective period specified in each class determination and findings(Dandamp;F) shall not ordinarily exceed one year.

If an incentive contract is proposed,discuss the type or types of incentive considered most suitable for theaccomplishment of the procurement objectives. (10) <T3>Item 10. Contractor-owned and Government-furnished property. </T3>(i)If the proposed contract, exclusive of options, will be for a shorter periodthan the useful life, for the program, of any required contractor-ownedor leased facilities (as defined in FAR 45.301) and the facilities areunlikely to be needed by the contractor for any purpose other than theprogram effort being contracted for, then the procurement plan shall discussthe feasibility of the Government acquiring the right to use the facilitiesfor longer than the proposed contract period as well as the proposed procurementstrategy for accomplishing this use. The following shall be considered: (A) If program uncertainties for continuing beyond the contract periodof performance are sufficient, it may be in the Government's best interestto acquire use of the facilities during only that time. This strategy maymake the facilities more costly to the Government for the contract periodthan if a contractual arrangement for longer use were made. However, itshould reduce the program risks associated with longer Government facilitiesobligations; and (B) If it is in the Government's best interests to acquire the right touse the facilities for longer than the proposed contract period in orderto take advantage of economies in long-term facilities investment, thenthe proposed contractor's obligations, the Government's obligations (e.g.,contract terms and profit) that will encourage long-term investment, thecontract cost strategy for facilities, and funding limitations shall beaddressed. There are many alternative long-term investment approaches availablefor the contracting officer to consider. Some examples of representativestrategies include requiring the contractor to_ (1) Enter into a long-term lease of the facilities from a lessor, subjectto the lease being canceled if the prime contractor does not continue toperform the requirement throughout the useful life of the facilities (e.g.,the contractor is not selected in a subsequent recompetition of the requirement).Using this strategy, the contracting officer should encourage the contractorto seek an option to transfer the lease to a successor contractor;  (2) Purchase the facilities, with depreciation and cost-of-money acceleratedfor the contract period of performance, at the conclusion of which theGovernment has a unilateral option to purchase the facilities at the depreciatedvalue (at or near $0) based on the contractor's depreciation schedule.The facilities could then be provided to the successor contractor as Governmentproperty (see FAR 30.409-50(e)(5) and 30.409-60(d)); and (3) Purchase the facilities, with depreciation and cost-of-money over theuseful life (determined without regard to program or contract duration;see FAR 30.409-40(b)(1)) of the facilities. At the completion of the contractperiod of performance, either the Government would purchase the facilitiesat their depreciated value, or the successor contractor would be requiredto purchase the facilities, also at their depreciated value, and continuethe prior contractor's depreciation approach.  (ii) Indicate, by checking the appropriate box, whether the procurementwill require providing any existing, new, or modified Government property.When other Government property is to be provided, identify the items anddollar amounts involved. The dollar amounts provided in Item 10 shall notbe included in those specified under Items 6 and 7 unless the propertyor facilities are part of the procurement. If dollar amounts in Item 10are included under Items 6 and 7, they should be so annotated under thisitem on the following pages. (11) <T3>Item 11. Procurement action schedule. </T3>Indicate the date the procurementplan was submitted to Headquarters for review and approval. For all otherentries, provide only the number of calendar days required to completethe action (beginning at the time the previous action was scheduled tobe completed) in order to meet the program schedule. (c) Additional pages. (1) <T3>General.</T3> Additional pages to the plan should include any informationrequired from the Form 1451 items. Include any comments required by paragraph(a) of this section not covered elsewhere and any other information neededto amplify or clarify any item. In addition_ (i) Identify any deviations from the FAR or NFS (A separate request fordeviation must be submitted. See 1807.103(b)(2).);  (ii) Identify any special conditions or clauses required;  (iii) Identify all separate approvals required in support of the proposedprocurement;  (iv) Include a copy of any comments by legal counsel for the contractingoffice (or a statement that counsel has no objection to the plan), anddescribe actions taken in response to them (counsel's concurrence willsatisfy this item); and  (v) Discuss consideration given to participation by small business, includingminority business enterprises. (2) <T3>Competition. </T3>Describe how competition will be sought and promoted.If appropriate, discuss how it will be sustained through the course ofthe acquisition. If full and open competition is not contemplated, citethe authority in FAR 6.202 or 6.302; identify the source(s); and discusswhy it cannot be obtained. When effective subcontract competition is bothfeasible and desirable, describe how such subcontract competition willbe sought, promoted, and sustained throughout the course of the competition.Identify any known barriers to increasing subcontract competition and addresshow to overcome them. (3) <T3>Relationship to other procurements, relevant data, and studies. </T3>Discussthe relationship of this procurement to any active contracts, includingtheir status of completion. Identify the extent to which their productmay affect this procurement. Indicate whether performance under them shouldbe permitted to continue during the competitive phase of this action. Discussall relevant data and studies, whether obtained under contract or throughin-house efforts, and state whether they will be made available to allofferors participating in the competition. If data or studies are available,but it is not planned to make them available to prospective offerors, statewhy. <ITAG tagnum="80">1807.170-2 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Procurement plans requiring approval at the installation level. </ITAG>Procurement plans prepared for installation-level approval shall be preparedin accordance with 1807.170-1 or in the format prescribed by the installation.<ITAG tagnum="80">1807.170-3 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Assistance in providing for reliability assurance in procurement plans.</ITAG>When system hardware costing over $1,000,000 is involved, reliability personnelat the field installation shall assist in procurement-plan preparationwith respect to arrangements for reliability monitoring.

Solicitationsfor information or planning purposes can have desirable benefits. Theycan promote competition and help ensure the reasonableness and feasibilityof the requirement. Potential sources can be apprised of NASA requirementsin a particular field and invited to submit data for consideration earlyin the acquisition process without undue expenditure of time, effort, andmoney.(b) Solicitations for information or planning purposes may not be usedas a means for prequalifying offerors. While, under some circumstances,their use may lengthen the acquisition cycle, it may shorten the time requiredfor submitting proposals when a large quantity of data must be analyzedby industry before proposals can be submitted.<ITAG tagnum="80">1815.405-70</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Application.</ITAG>(a) Solicitations for information or planning purposes should be utilizedwhen appropriate; e.g., in major systems acquisitions or other complexprojects for which feasibility or technology studies are being conducted(either in-house or by contract) that may have relevance to later competitions.The results of such studies may be made available to industry as soon asthey are known or periodically.(b) Requirements for automatic data processing equipment or support servicesto perform specified operations or achieve certain results may be suitablefor advance review and comment by the private sector when diverse approachesto accomplishing mission objectives may be feasible. The material madeavailable in advance may vary from a comprehensive draft of a proposedrequirement to a partial draft; e.g., statement of work and/or specificationsor reports.<ITAG tagnum="80">1815.405-71</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Procedure.</ITAG>(a) In making advance information available to industry, sufficient timeshould be allowed to permit potential sources an opportunity, commensuratewith the task, to prepare and submit a response to the solicitation forinformation or planning purposes. Invitations for bids and requests forproposals may not be used for these purposes. Solicitations for informationor planning purposes may be issued only with the procurement officer'sprior approval (see FAR 15.405-1). (b) The provision at FAR 52.215-3 does not prohibit the allowance, underFAR 31.205-18, of the cost of preparing a response to the solicitation.Solicitations for information or planning purposes shall at least: (1) Request an expression of interest in the contemplated requirement and(2) Designate a time and place for submitting responses.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Each solicitation shall define, as explicitly as possible, the informationthe Government desires and indicate whether it is contemplated that thesolicitation will be followed by a conference. After approval by the procurementofficer, the solicitation shall be forwarded to potential sources and synopsizedaccording to in FAR Subpart 5.2. (c) Each source responding to the solicitation shall be advised of thedetails of any pending conference. The conference, when provided for, shallbe conducted by procurement personnel and should be attended by technical,legal, and other personnel as appropriate. Care must be taken not to prejudiceany future competition. All sources shall be furnished identical informationin connection with the proposed requirement.

Under the solicitation for information or planning purposes procedure,interested firms may suggest changes in a proposed specification or statementof work; propose alternatives in concept, method, design, system integration,and the like that might result in lower costs without sacrificing performance;or recommend changes in other requirements regarding the product or serviceinvolved.

(Examples are optionsand later phases as in A-109 procurements.) Exceptions to this requirementinclude architect-engineer procurements and procurements of ADP subjectto the Brooks Act (40 U.S.C. 759), as implemented by the Federal InformationResources Management Regulation (FIRMR) (41 CFR Part 201). However, theuse of SEB procedures is optional for procurements of ADP subject to theBrooks Act.

(b) <T3>Evaluation and selection procedures</T3>_(1) <T3>Responsibility of source selection official. </T3>In the final analysis,NASA's judgment on the totality of the evaluation will be that of the sourceselection official, including assessment of the procedures followed bythe SEB, the validity of its substantive evaluations, the relative significanceof the several areas of evaluation and their weightings in the light ofall the information produced by the source evaluation and selection process.(2) <T3>Evaluation factors, subfactors, and elements and weights. </T3>Establishingevaluation factors, subfactors, and elements and their weights requiresthe exercise of judgment on a case-by-case basis. They should be tailoredto the requirements of each procurement. Technical excellence, price orestimated cost, and contractor management capability are important factorsin selection. Their relative importance depends on the nature of the productsor services procured. Any factor may tip the balance when competition isvery close. Evaluation factors, subfactors, and elements shall be describedin each RFP sufficient to inform evaluators and prospective offerors ofthe significant matters to be addressed in proposals. The evaluation factors(Mission Suitability, Relevant Experience and Past Performance, Cost, andOther Considerations) shall be described, and a statement of their relativeimportance included. In addition, the weights assigned to the Mission Suitabilitysubfactors and elements shall be included in the RFP. (3) <T3>Initial identification of proposals not considered acceptable. </T3>(i)After review of committee ratings and other information known to the committeesor the SEB and before ranking of proposals by the SEB, the SEB may discontinuethe evaluation of any proposal that is unacceptable because_ (A) It does not represent a reasonable initial effort to address itselfto the essential requirements of the RFP or clearly demonstrates that theofferor does not understand the requirements of the RFP;  (B) In research or development procurement, a substantial design drawbackinheres in the proposal, and sufficient correction or improvement to considerthe proposal acceptable would require virtually an entirely new technicalproposal; or (C) It contains major technical or business deficiencies or omissions orout-of-line costs which discussions with the offeror could not reasonablybe expected to cure. (ii) Simple technical nonresponsiveness in the sense in which the termis used in sealed bidding is not alone sufficient to constitute unacceptabilityif the proposal is otherwise competitive, and written and/or oral discussionsor negotiations after selection reasonably offer the likelihood of resolution.When there is doubt as to whether a proposal should be rejected initiallyas unacceptable, that doubt shall be resolved by including it for furtherconsideration. (iii) Documentation must be prepared by the SEB as to why the deficienciesof any proposal are believed to be of sufficient significance to warrantdiscontinuing evaluation of the proposal at this point in the process.(4) <T3>Determination of competitive range. </T3>(i) After initial identificationof proposals not considered acceptable, the SEB shall tentatively rankthe remaining proposals in accordance with the established scoring system.The SEB should not give scores for cost as such. After this ranking iscompleted, the proposals shall be reviewed to determine which are withinthe competitive range; namely, those having a reasonable chance of beingselected for final award. In making this determination, the SEB, togetherwith the contracting officer, shall evaluate the potential for improvingthe competitive position of the proposals by written or oral discussionsconducted in accordance with subparagraph (b)(5) of this section. (ii) The competitive range consists of the best proposals, consideringmission suitability, cost or price, relevant experience and past performance,and other considerations. When there is doubt as to whether a proposalis within the competitive range, that doubt shall be resolved by includingit. (iii) The initial number of offerors whose proposals are considered asbeing within the competitive range may be narrowed as a result of the writtenor oral discussions. However, a proposal initially included in the competitiverange should not be rejected without giving the offeror an opportunityto submit a revised proposal to serve as the basis for establishing thenew competitive range, unless the discussions relating to an ambiguityor omission make it clear that the proposal should not have been includedin the competitive range initially. (5) <T3>Conduct of written or oral discussions_</T3>(i) <T3>General</T3>. Careful judgment must be exercised in determining theextent of discussions. In some cases, good business practice may warranthaving more than one round of discussions with the offerors whose proposalsare considered in the competitive range. The time available, the expenseand administrative limitations, and the size and significance of the procurementshould all be considered in deciding on the type, duration, and depth ofthe discussions. (ii) Cost-reimbursement contracts and all contracts for research and development. (A) The contracting officer, in concert with or on behalf of the SEB, willconduct written and/or oral discussions of the effort to be accomplishedand the cost or price of the effort with all offerors determined to bewithin the competitive range. The discussions are intended to assist theSEB or other evaluators: (<T3>1</T3>) In understanding fully each offeror's proposal and its strengthsand weaknesses based upon the individual efforts of each offeror, (<T3>2</T3>) In assuring that the meanings and the points of emphasis ofRFP provisions have been adequately conveyed to the offerors so that allare competing equally on the basis intended by the Government, (<T3>3</T3>) In evaluating the personnel proposed by each firm, and (<T3>4</T3>) In presenting a report to the Source Selection Official thatmakes the discriminations among proposals clear and visible.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">In this process, prior to contractor selection, the Government's interestsare not served by its assuming the role of an information exchange or clearinghouse. (B) In cost-reimbursement type contracts and all research and developmentcontracts, the contracting officer shall point out instances in which themeaning of some aspect of a proposal is not clear and instances in whichsome aspects of the proposal failed to include substantiation for a proposedapproach, solution, or cost estimate.  (C) However, where the meaning of a proposal is clear and the Board hassufficient information to assess its validity and the proposal containsa weakness that is inherent in an offeror's management, engineering, orscientific judgment or which is the result of its own lack of competenceor inventiveness in preparing its proposal, the contracting officer shallnot point out the weaknesses. Discussions are useful in ascertaining thepresence or absence of strengths and weaknesses. The possibility that suchdiscussions may lead an offeror to discover that it has a weakness is nota reason for failing to inquire into a matter where the meaning is notclear or where insufficient information is available, since understandingof the meaning and validity of the proposed approaches, solutions, andcost estimates is essential to a sound selection. Offerors should not beinformed of the relative strengths or weaknesses of their proposals inrelation to those of other offerors. To do so would be contrary to otherregulations which prohibit the use of auction techniques (see FAR 15.610(d)(3)).In the course of discussions, Government participants should be carefulnot to transmit information which could give leads to one offeror as tohow its proposal may be improved or which could reveal a competitor's ideas. (D) The foregoing guidelines are not all-inclusive. Careful judgment mustbe exercised in the light of all the circumstances of each procurementto promote the most advantageous selection from the standpoint of the Governmentwhile, at the same time, maintaining the fairness of the competitive process. (E) The contracting officer shall give each offeror a reasonable opportunity(with a common cut-off date for all) to support and clarify its proposalin a best and final offer which shall be submitted at the conclusion ofdiscussions. An offeror may, on its own initiative, revise its proposaland make corrections or improvements until the established cut-off date.(iii) Fixed-price contracts other than for research and development.  (A) In fixed-price type contracts other than for research and development,the specifications ordinarily describe the Government's requirements withmore particularity than is possible in cost reimbursement or research anddevelopment contracting so that less emphasis is placed on an offeror'sintroduction of scientific, engineering, and management innovations. Thecontracting officer will conduct discussions in accordance with the provisionsof subdivision (b)(5)(ii) of this section, except for the difference insubdivision (b)(5)(iii)(B) of this section.  (B) The contracting officer, in written or oral discussions, shall pointout instances in which some aspect of a proposal contains a weakness inrelation to the Government's requirements. But, as provided in subdivision(b)(5)(ii) of this section, the contracting officer shall neither pointout the relative strengths or weaknesses of a proposal in relation to thoseof other offerors nor transmit information which could give leads to oneofferor as to how its proposal may be improved or which could reveal acompetitor's ideas. The contracting officer shall point out price elementsthat do not appear to be justified and shall encourage offerors to putforward their most favorable price proposals, but shall not discuss, disclose,or compare price elements of any other offeror. (6) <T3>Conduct of negotiations prior to selection. </T3>If, after conclusionof written or oral discussions, the SEB considers that the evaluation findingsthus far completed are not sufficiently comprehensive for the Source SelectionOfficial to make a decision, it may be prudent and necessary to conductfurther discussions or final negotiations with those offerors remainingin the competitive range prior to presentation of the findings to the SourceSelection Official. This course of action must be considered as an exceptionto the SEB process and therefore may be accomplished only with the approvalof the Assistant Administrator for Procurement. (7) <T3>Notice and debriefing. </T3>When a proposal is no longer to be consideredfor contract award, the offeror shall be promptly notified, in writing,together with a general, reasonably brief explanation of the major reasons.If an offeror requests, in writing, a debriefing as a result of this notice,it will be accorded a formal debriefing in accordance with Subpart 1815.10.The debriefing should be provided at the earliest feasible time, whichnormally shall be after announcement of the selection decision and beforeaward of the contract. However, when the exigency of the situation willnot permit delaying the award in order to debrief unsuccessful offerors,debriefings may be conducted after award. (8) <T3>Report to source selection official. </T3>The SEB report shall summarizethe primary points of discussion and show the effects of the discussionson the evaluation of proposals. The report shall set forth the strengthsand weaknesses of each proposal, with an estimate of the potential forcorrection of the principal weaknesses identified. The report should alsostate the SEB's estimate of the approximate impact on cost or price thatwill result from the elimination of correctable weaknesses during negotiationsafter selection. <ITAG tagnum="80">1815.613-72 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">NASA solicitation provision. </ITAG>The provision at 1852.215-70, Increases in Estimated Costs, shall be includedin all RFP's to be evaluated pursuant to SEB procedures, if award of acost-reimbursement contract (with or without incentive arrangements) iscontemplated. The purpose of this provision is to advise offerors selectedfor final negotiation that they may not unilaterally increase their estimatedcosts except for the reasons cited in the provision.

Since the PPM will ultimatelybecome the basis for negotiation, it should be structured to provide anaudit trail to the contract negotiation memorandum (see FAR 15.808 and1815.808). Generally, the PPM should address the following subjects, inthe order presented: (a) <T3>Introduction.</T3> Include a brief description of the procurement anda brief history indicating the extent of competition and its results. Identifythe contractor and place of performance (if not evident from the descriptionof the procurement). In addition, the negotiation schedule should be addressedand the Government negotiating team members identified by name and position.(b) <T3>Special features and requirements.</T3> In this area, discuss any specialfeatures (and related cost impact) of the procurement, including such itemsas_(1) Letter-contract or precontract cost requirements; (2) Government property to be furnished; (3) Contract option requirements; (4) Contractor/Government investment in facilities and equipment (and anymodernization to be provided by the contractor/Government); (5) Plant reconversion or plant clearance (see 1845.106-71); and (6) Any deviations, special clauses, or unusual conditions anticipated.(c) <T3>Cost and profit/fee analysis.</T3> (1) Include a parallel tabulation,by element of cost and profit/fee, of the contractor's proposal, the Government'snegotiation objective, and the Government's maximum position. For eachelement of cost, compare the contractor and Government estimates and explainhow each was developed, including the estimating assumptions and projectiontechniques employed. Explain how historical costs, including costs incurredunder a letter contract (if applicable), were used in developing the negotiationobjective. (2) Significant differences between the field pricing report (includingany audit reports) and the negotiation objectives and/or contractor's proposalshould be highlighted and explained, as should technical evaluation resultsthat caused the Government's cost negotiation objectives to differ significantlyfrom the contractor's proposed cost (such as differences in staffing).There should be an identification and a brief discussion of each majorsubcontract involved, citing the type of subcontract and stating the degreeof analysis performed on the subcontract cost estimate. In addition, therationale for the Government's profit/fee objectives and a completed copyof the NASA Form 634, Structured Approach_Profit/Fee Objective, if appropriate,should be included. (3) Include particulars of the disposition of audit recommendations here.Resolution shall be considered accomplished when negotiation approval isgranted. If, for some reason, the particulars cannot be included in thePPM, the disposition of the audit recommendations must be documented inthe price negotiation memorandum (see FAR 15.808) or in other relevantfile memoranda. (d) <T3>Type of contract contemplated.</T3> Explain the type of contract contemplatedand the reasons for its suitability. For an incentive contract, includingaward-fee contracts, describe the planned structuring arrangement in termsof profit/fee patterns, share lines, ceilings, and so forth.

The scope of coverage, exact proceduresto be followed, levels of management review, and contract file documentationrequirements should be directly related to the dollar value and complexityof the procurement and shall be determined by each installation. The primarypurpose of these reviews is to ensure that the negotiator, or negotiatingteam, is thoroughly prepared to enter into negotiations with a well-conceived,realistic, and fair plan. <ITAG tagnum="80">1815.807-72 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Headquarters reviews. </ITAG>Approval of the prenegotiation position by the Assistant Administratorfor Procurement is required before negotiations on any procurement actionselected for Headquarters review are entered into. Generally, at the timea procurement is processed as a Master Buy Plan (MBP) action under Subpart1807.71, a decision will have been made as to whether the prenegotiationposition will be subject to Headquarters review and approval. However,prenegotiation positions on MBP procurement actions when the prenegotiationposition was not initially selected for Headquarters review and approval,and non-MBP procurement action prenegotiation positions, may be selectedfor Headquarters review and approval at any point in the acquisition cycleprior to actual negotiations. (a) <T3>Scheduling of presentation. </T3>When a prenegotiation presentationis required by Headquarters or requested by the installation concerned,scheduling of the presentation will be arranged by the Office of Procurement,Program Operations Division (Code HS), in consultation with appropriateHeadquarters program officials. The installation shall notify Code HS sufficientlyin advance of the desired presentation to permit scheduling and preparationby Headquarters staff. (b) <T3>Advance information. </T3>Not less than ten working days in advanceof the scheduled prenegotiation presentation, the installation shall provideCode HS with the following: (1) Five copies of the PPM. (2) Five copies of any briefing charts and/or viewgraphs to be used inthe presentation. Briefing charts and/or viewgraphs shall summarize keypoints/factors identified in the PPM and should be grouped in the samemanner as presented in the PPM. (3) One copy each of the contractor's proposal, the Government technicalevaluation, and all pricing reports (including any audit reports). (c) <T3>Waiver. </T3>The Assistant Administrator for Procurement may waivethe presentation requirement if, on the basis of Headquarters review ofthe advance information provided under subparagraph (b)(2) of this section,it is clear that installation personnel are thoroughly prepared to enterinto negotiations. (d) <T3>Safeguarding prenegotiation material. </T3>Prenegotiation data arevery sensitive and should be handled accordingly. Close coordination withCode HS personnel should be maintained to ensure that prenegotiation materialis not compromised during transit.

The contracting officer may dothis when convinced that the amount included for subcontracting is reasonable;e.g., when realistic cost or pricing data on subcontract efforts are available.(b) However, even though the available cost data are highly indefiniteand there is a distinct chance that one or more of the subcontracts eventuallymay be redetermined at prices lower than those predicted in redeterminingthe prime contract price, other circumstances may require prompt negotiationof the final contract price. In such a case, the contract modificationevidencing the revised contract price should provide for adjustment ofthe total amount paid or to be paid under the contract on account of subsequentredetermination of the specified subcontracts. This may be done by includingin the contract modification the clause prescribed at 1815.870-2. <ITAG tagnum="80">1815.870-2 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">NASA contract clause. </ITAG>The contracting officer shall insert the clause at 1852.215-71, Adjustmentfor Subcontract Price Redetermination, in contract modifications that reflecta repricing of the prime contract when the prime contractor has not establishedfinal prices for one or more subcontracts under the contract that are ona price-redetermination or fixed-price incentive basis. <ITAG tagnum="80">1815.871 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Procedures for identifying contractor's unallowable costs. </ITAG>(a) The establishment, maintenance, and consistent use of procedures foridentifying and segregating unallowable costs, which will assure compliancewith CAS 405 and FAR 31.201-6, will benefit both the Government and contractors.Such procedures may vary between plants or divisions of a contractor becauseof size, mix of business, or complexity of organization. Some of the advantagesof sound procedures are that_(1) A greater degree of confidence can be placed on the accuracy and reliabilityof contractors' proposals, billings, and claims; (2) They expedite the negotiation process; and (3) They may reduce the scope of reviews performed by audit and other technicaland procurement personnel.

The weightranges listed after each factor on NASA Form 634, Structured Approach Profit/FeeObjective, shall be used whenever the structured approach is used.(b) The contracting officer shall first measure Contractor Effort by assigninga profit percentage, within the designated weight ranges, to each elementof contract cost recognized by the contracting officer. The amount calculatedfor the cost of money for facilities capital is not to be included in thecomputation of profit as part of the cost base.(c) The suggested categories under Contractor Effort are for referencepurposes only. Often individual proposals will be in a different format;but since these categories are broad and basic, they provide sufficientguidance to evaluate all other items of cost.(d) After computing a total dollar profit for Contractor Effort, the contractingofficer shall calculate the specific profit dollars assigned for cost risk,investment, performance, socioeconomic programs, inventive developmentalcontributions, and additional factors. This is accomplished by multiplyingthe total government cost objective, exclusive of any cost of money forfacilities capital, by the specific weight assigned to the elements withinthe Other Factors category. NASA Form 634 should be used, as appropriate,to facilitate calculation of this profit objective (calculating Inventiveand Developmental Contributions and Unusual Pricing Agreements and combiningthem under Special Situations).(e) In making a judgment of the value of each factor, the contracting officershould be governed by the definition, description, and purpose of the factorsand the considerations for evaluating them as set forth in 1815.970-1,1815.970-2, and 1815.970-3.(f) The structured approach was designed for arriving at profit or feeobjectives for commercial organizations (FAR Subpart 31.2). However, ifappropriate adjustments are made, the structured approach can be used asa basis for arriving at fee objectives for nonprofit organizations (FARSubpart 31.7), excluding educational institutions (FAR Subpart 31.3). Itis NASA policy not to pay profit or fee on contracts with educational institutions.Therefore, the structured approach, as modified in subparagraph (f)(2)of this section, shall be used for nonprofit organizations. The modificationsshould not be applied as deductions against historical fee levels, butrather to the fee objective for commercial organizations as calculatedunder the structured approach. (1) For purposes of this paragraph (f), nonprofit organizations are definedas those business entities that are: (i) Organized and operated exclusively for charitable, scientific, or educationalpurposes, no part of the net earnings of which inure to the benefit ofany private shareholder or individual, and (ii) Are exempt from Federal income taxation under section 501 of the InternalRevenue Code. (2) For contracts with nonprofit organizations under which fees are involved,an adjustment of up to 3 percent shall be subtracted from the total profit/feeobjective. In developing this adjustment, it will be necessary to consider_(i) Tax position benefits; (ii) Granting of financing through letters of credit; (iii) Facility requirements of the nonprofit organization; and (iv) Other pertinent factors that may work to either the advantage or disadvantageof the contractor in its position as a nonprofit organization. <ITAG tagnum="80">1815.970-1</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89"> Common factors. </ITAG>(a) <T3>Contractor effort.</T3> This factor is a measure of how much the contractoris expected to contribute to the overall effort necessary to meet the contractperformance requirements efficiently. This factor, which is apart fromthe contractor's responsibility for contract performance, takes into accountwhat resources are necessary and what the contractor must do to accomplisha conversion of ideas and materials into the final product called for inthe contract. This is a recognition that within a given performance output,or within a given sales dollar figure, necessary efforts on the part ofindividual contractors can vary widely in both value and quantity, andthat the profit objective should reflect the extent and nature of the contractor'scontribution to total performance. A major consideration, particularlyin experimental, developmental, or research work, is the difficulty orcomplexity of the work to be performed, and the unusual demands of thecontract, such as whether the project involves a new approach unrelatedto existing equipment or only refinements of existing equipment. Evaluationof this factor requires analyzing the cost content of the proposed contractas follows: (1) <T3>Material acquisition (subcontracted items, purchased parts, and othermaterial).</T3> (i) Analysis of these cost items shall include an evaluationof the managerial and technical effort necessary to obtain the requiredpurchased parts, subcontracted items, and other materials, including specialtooling. This evaluation shall include consideration of the number of ordersand suppliers, and whether established sources are available or new sourcesmust be developed. The contracting officer shall also determine whetherthe contractor will, for example, obtain the material and tooling by routineorders from readily available supplies (particularly those of substantialvalue in relation to the total contract cost), or by detailed subcontractsfor which the prime contractor will be required to develop complex specificationsinvolving creative design or close tolerance manufacturing requirements.(ii) Consideration should be given to the managerial and technical effortsnecessary for the prime contractor to administer subcontracts and selectsubcontractors, including efforts to break out subcontracts from sole sourcesthrough the introduction of competition. These determinations should bemade for purchases of raw materials or basic commodities; purchases ofprocessed material, including all types of components of standard or near-standardcharacteristics; and purchases of pieces, assemblies, subassemblies, specialtooling, and other products special to the end item. In the applicationof the criterion, it should be recognized that the contractor's purchasingprogram might make a substantial contribution to the performance of thecontract. This might be applicable in the management of subcontractingprograms involving many sources, new complex components and instrumentation,incomplete specifications, and close surveillance by the prime contractor'srepresentative. (iii) Recognized costs proposed as direct material costs, such as scrapcharges, shall be treated as material for profit evaluation. If intracompanytransfers are accepted at price in accordance with FAR 31.205-26(e), theyshall be evaluated as material. Other intracompany transfers shall be evaluatedby individual components of cost, i.e., material, labor, and overhead.(2) <T3>Direct labor (engineering, service, manufacturing, and other labor).</T3>(i) Analysis of the various items of the cost content of the contract shouldinclude evaluation of the comparative quality and level of the engineeringtalents, service contract labor, manufacturing skills, and experience tobe employed. In evaluating engineering labor for the purpose of assigningprofit dollars, consideration should be given to the amount of notablescientific talent or unusual or scarce engineering talent needed, in contrastto journeyman engineering effort or supporting personnel. The diversity,or lack of diversity, of scientific and engineering specialties requiredfor contract performance, and the corresponding need for engineering supervisionand coordination, should be evaluated. Such circumstances as whether thecaliber or class of engineer involved is that of an ``idea-man''_or whetherthe contractor is required by the contract to assign to the work, becauseof its nature, unusually skilled talent_should be considered as part ofthe evaluation. (ii) Service contract labor should be evaluated in a like manner by assigninghigher weights to engineering or professional skills and lower weightsto semiprofessional or other skills required for contract performance.(iii) Similarly, the variety of manufacturing and other categories of laborskills required and the contractor's manpower resources for meeting theserequirements should be considered. For purposes of evaluation, categoriesof labor (i.e., quality control, receiving and inspecting, etc.) not fallingwithin the definition for engineering, service, or manufacturing labormay be categorized appropriately. However, the same evaluation considerationsas outlined above will be applied. (3) <T3>Overhead and general management (Gandamp;A). </T3>(i) Analysis of theseoverhead items of cost includes the evaluation of the makeup of these expensesand how much they contribute to contract performance. To the extent practicable,the analysis should include a determination of the amount of labor withinthese overhead pools and how this labor would be treated if it were considereddirect labor under the contract. The allocable labor elements should begiven the same profit consideration they would receive if they were treatedas direct labor. The other elements of these overhead pools should be evaluatedto determine whether they are routine expenses such as utilities and maintenance,and hence given lesser profit consideration, or are significant contributingelements. The composite of the individual determinations in relation tothe elements of the overhead pools will be the profit consideration giventhe pools as a whole. (ii) It is not necessary that the contractor's accounting system breakdown overhead expenses within the classification of engineering overhead,manufacturing overhead, other overhead pools, and general and administrativeexpenses (Gandamp;A), unless dictated otherwise by Cost Accounting Standards(CAS). The contractor whose accounting system reflects only one overheadrate on all direct labor need not change its system (if CAS-exempt) tocorrespond with the above classifications. The contracting officer, inan evaluation of such a contractor's overhead rate, could break out theapplicable sections of the composite rate, which could be classified asengineering overhead, manufacturing overhead, other overhead pools, andGandamp;A expenses, and follow the appropriate evaluation technique. (iii) Management problems surface in various degrees, and the managementexpertise exercised to solve them should be considered as an element ofprofit. For example, a new program for an item on the cutting edge of thestate of the art will cause more problems and require more managerial timeand abilities of a higher order than will a follow-on contract. If newcontracts create more problems and require a higher profit weight, follow-onsshould be adjusted downward, since many of the problems should have beensolved. In any event, an evaluation of the underlying managerial effortinvolved should be made on a case-by-case basis. (iv) It may not be necessary for the contracting officer to make a separateprofit evaluation of overhead expenses in connection with each procurementaction for substantially the same product with the same contractor. Ifan analysis of the profit weight to be assigned to the overhead pool hasbeen made, that weight assigned may be used for future procurements withthe same contractor until there is a change in the cost composition ofthe overhead pool or the contract circumstances, or the factors discussedin subdivision (a)(3)(iii) of this section are involved. (4) <T3>Other costs. </T3>Include all other direct costs associated with contractorperformance under this item (e.g., travel and relocation, direct support,and consultants). Analysis of these items of cost should include(i) The significance of the costs to contract performance, (ii) Their nature, and (iii) How much they contribute to contract performance. (b) <T3>Contract cost risk. </T3>The degree of risk assumed by the contractorshould influence the amount of profit or fee a contractor is entitled toanticipate. For example, if a portion of the risk has been shifted to theGovernment through cost-reimbursement or price-redetermination provisions,unusual contingency provisions, or other risk-reducing measures, the amountof profit or fee should be less than for arrangements under which the contractorassumes all the risk. In developing the prenegotiation profit objective,the contracting officer will need to consider the type of contract anticipatedto be negotiated and the contractor risk associated with it when selectingthe position in the weight range for profit appropriate for the risk tobe borne by the contractor. This factor is one of the most important inarriving at prenegotiation profit objectives. (1) Evaluation of this risk requires a determination of:(i) The degree of cost responsibility the contractor assumes, (ii) The reliability of the cost estimates in relation to the task assumed,and (iii) The complexity of the task assumed by the contractor.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">This factor is specifically limited to the risk of contract costs.Thus, risks on the part of the contractor such as reputation, losing acommercial market, or losing potential profits in other fields, or anyrisk on the part of the contracting office such as the risk of not acquiringan effective space vehicle, are not within the scope of this factor. (2) The first and basic determination of the degree of cost responsibilityassumed by the contractor is related to the sharing of total risk of contractcost by the Government and the contractor through the selection of contracttype. The extremes are a cost-plus-fixed-fee contract requiring the contractorto use its best efforts to perform a task and a firm fixed-price contractfor a complex item. A cost-plus-fixed-fee contract reflects a minimum assumptionof cost responsibility, while a firm-fixed-price contract reflects a completeassumption of cost responsibility. When the proper contract type has beenselected, the regard for risk by contract type would usually fall withinthe 0-to-3-percent range for cost-reimbursement contracts and 3 to 7 percentfor fixed-price contracts. (3) The second determination is that of the reliability of the cost estimates.Sound price negotiation requires well-defined contract objectives and reliablecost estimates. Prior experience assists the contractor in preparing reliablecost estimates on new procurements for similar equipment. An excessivecost estimate reduces the possibility that the cost of performance willexceed the contract price, thereby reducing the contractor's assumptionof contract cost risk. (4) The third determination is that of the difficulty of the contractor'stask. The contractor's task can be difficult or easy, regardless of contracttype. (i) Within the ranges set forth in subparagraph (b)(2) of this section,a cost-plus-fixed-fee contract normally would not justify a reward forrisk in excess of 0 percent, unless the contract contains cost risk featuressuch as ceilings on overheads, etc. In such cases, up to 0.5 percent maybe justified. Cost-plus-incentive-fee contracts fill the remaining portionof the range, with weightings directly related to such factors as confidencein target cost, share ratio of fees, etc. (ii) The range for fixed-price contracts is wide enough to accommodatethe various types of fixed-price arrangements. These include fixed-priceincentive, firm-fixed-price with economic price adjustment, fixed-pricewith prospective or retroactive price redetermination, and firm-fixed-pricecontracts. Weighting should be indicative of the price risk assumed andthe end item required, with only firm-fixed-price contracts with requirementsfor prototypes or hardware reaching the top end of the range. (iii) The contractor's subcontracting program may have a significant impacton the contractor's acceptance of risk under a contract form. It couldcause risk to increase or decrease in terms of both cost and performance.This consideration should be a part of the contracting officer's overallevaluation in selecting a factor to apply for cost risk. It may be determined,for instance, that the prime contractor has effectively transferred realcost risk to a subcontractor, and the contract cost risk evaluation may,as a result, be below the range that would otherwise apply for the contracttype proposed. The contract cost risk evaluation should not be lowered,however, merely on the basis that a substantial portion of the contractcosts represents subcontracts without any substantial transfer of the contractor'srisk. (iv) In making a contract cost risk evaluation in a procurement actionthat involves definitization of a letter contract, unpriced change orders,or unpriced orders under BOAs, consideration should be given to the effecton total contract cost risk as a result of having partial performance beforedefinitization. Under some circumstances it may be reasoned that the totalamount of cost risk has been effectively reduced. Under other circumstancesit may be apparent that the contractor's cost risk is substantially unchanged.To be equitable, determination of a profit weight for application to thetotal of all recognized costs, both incurred and yet to be expended, mustbe made with consideration of all attendant circumstances and should notjust be based on the portion of costs incurred, or percentage of work completed,before definitization. (v) Time-and-materials and labor-hour contracts shall be considered cost-plus-fixed-feecontracts for the purpose of establishing profit weights, unless otherwiseexempt under 1815.902, in evaluating the contractor's assumption of contractcost risk. (c) <T3>Investment. </T3>NASA encourages its contractors to perform their contractswith a minimum of financial, facilities, or other assistance from the Government.As such, it is the purpose of this factor to encourage the contractor toacquire and use its own resources to the maximum extent possible. Evaluationof this factor should include an analysis of the following: (1) <T3>Facilities. </T3>(i) To evaluate how this factor contributes to theprofit objective requires knowledge of the level of facilities utilizationneeded for contract performance, the source and financing of the requiredfacilities, and the overall cost effectiveness of the facilities offered.Contractors furnishing their own facilities that significantly contributeto lower total contract costs should be provided additional profit. Onthe other hand, contractors that rely on the Government to provide or financeneeded facilities should receive a corresponding reduction in profit. Casesbetween the above examples should be evaluated on their merits, with eithera positive or negative adjustment, as appropriate, in the profit objective.However, where a highly facilitized contractor is to perform a contractthat does not benefit from this facilitization, or when a contractor'suse of its facilities has a minimum cost impact on the contract, profitneed not be adjusted. (2) <T3>Payments. </T3>In analyzing this factor, consideration should be givento the frequency of payments by the Government to the contractor. The keyto this weighting is to give proper consideration to the impact the contractwill have on the contractor's cash flow. Generally, negative considerationshould be given for payments more frequent than monthly, with maximum reductionbeing given as the contractor's working capital approaches zero. Positiveconsideration should be given for payments less frequent than monthly,with additional consideration being given for a capital turnover rate onthe contract that is less than the contractor's or the industry's normalcapital turnover rate. (d) <T3>Contractor's performance. </T3>The contractor's past and present performanceshould be evaluated in such areas as product quality, meeting performanceschedules, efficiency in cost control (including the need for and reasonablenessof costs incurred), accuracy and reliability of previous cost estimates,degree of cooperation by the contractor (both business and technical),timely processing of changes and compliance with other contractual provisions,and subcontract program management. If a contractor has consistently achievedexcellent results in these areas in comparison with other contractors insimilar circumstances, such performance merits a proportionately greateropportunity for profit or fee. Conversely, a poor record in this regardshould be reflected in determining what constitutes a fair and reasonableprofit or fee. (e) <T3>Federal socioeconomic programs. </T3>This factor, which may apply tospecial circumstances or particular acquisitions, relates to the extentof the contractor's successful participation in Government-sponsored programssuch as small business, small disadvantaged business, and labor surplusarea programs and energy conservation efforts. Contractor policies andprocedures which energetically supporting Government socioeconomic programsand achieving success should be given positive consideration. Conversely,failure or unwillingness on the part of the contractor to support Governmentsocioeconomic programs should be viewed as evidence of poor performancefor the purpose of establishing this part of the profit objective. (f) <T3>Inventive and developmental contributions. </T3>(1) The extent andnature of contractor-initiated and -financed independent development shouldbe considered in developing the profit objective. The importance of thedevelopment in furthering space and aeronautical purposes, the demonstrableinitiative in determining the need for and application of the development,the extent of the contractor's cost risk, and whether the development costwas recovered directly or indirectly from Government sources should beweighed. (2) This factor need not be limited to situations that increase profit/feelevels. A negative consideration may be appropriate when the contractoris expected to obtain spin-off benefits as a direct result of the contract(e.g., products with commercial application). <ITAG tagnum="80">1815.970-2 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Additional factors_unusual pricing agreements. </ITAG>Occasionally, unusual contract pricing arrangements are made with the contractorunder which it agrees to participate in the sharing of contract cost oragrees to accept a lower profit or fee for changes or modifications withina prescribed dollar value.

When the selection has been made by the Field Installation Directoror a Headquarters Staff or Program Office head, the Center Director orOfficial-in-Charge of the Headquarters office shall designate an officialand necessary supporting staff to perform the debriefing. When SEB procedureswere not applied, the installation Procurement Officer, or designee, shallperform the debriefing. <ITAG tagnum="80">1815.1003-4 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Procedures. </ITAG>(a) The recipient of a written or oral debriefing request shall immediatelyrefer the request to the installation procurement officer. (b) The procurement officer, upon receipt of a debriefing request, shallinform the designated official and other concerned officials at the installationand, in the case of procurement actions where an Associate Administratoror the Administrator was the Selection Official, the cognizant NASA Headquarterspersonnel. (c) If an unsuccessful offeror in a negotiated procurement submits, priorto the award of the contract, a written request for a debriefing, sucha debriefing will be provided at the earliest feasible time. This normallyshall be after announcement of the selection decision and prior to awardof the contract. (``Selection decision'' means the final selection of theone successful contractor, or the contractors where more than one contractis to be awarded). If the selection decision involves more than one contractorpursuant to the Major System Acquisition process, the debriefing will belimited in such a manner that it does not prematurely disclose innovativeconcepts, designs, and approaches of the successful contractor(s) thatwould result in a transfusion of ideas which also could inhibit contractorsduring the early phase from offering their best and most promising ideasfor meeting the mission need. However, when the exigency of the situationwill not permit delaying the award in order to debrief unsuccessful offerors,such debriefings may be conducted after award. (d) A summary of the results of each debriefing, signed by the conductingNASA official, shall be placed in the contract file. <ITAG tagnum="52">PART 1816_TYPES OF CONTRACTS </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="72">Subpart 1816.2_Fixed-Price Contracts </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="70">Sec.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1816.202 Firm-fixed-price contracts. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1816.202-70 NASA contract clause. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1816.203 Fixed-price contracts with economic price  adjustment. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1816.203-4 Contract clauses. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1816.207 Firm-fixed-price, level-of-effort term  contracts. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1816.207-70 NASA contract clause. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="72">Subpart 1816.3_Cost-Reimbursement Contracts </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1816.301 General. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1816.301-3 Limitations. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1816.303 Cost-sharing contracts. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1816.307 Contract clauses. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1816.307-70 NASA contract clauses. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1816.370 Forms. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="72">Subpart 1816.4_Incentive Contracts </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1816.403 Fixed-price incentive contracts. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1816.404 Cost-reimbursement incentive contracts. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1816.404-2 Cost-plus-award-fee contracts. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1816.405 Contract clauses. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1816.405-70 NASA contract clause. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="72">Subpart 1816.5_Indefinite-Delivery Contracts </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1816.506 Ordering. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="72">Subpart 1816.6_Time-and-Materials, Labor-Hour, and Letter Contracts</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1816.603 Letter contracts. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1816.603-4 Contract clause. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1816.603-470 NASA contract clause. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1816.603-70 Information to include in a letter  contract. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1816.603-71 Authority to approve the issuance of  a letter contract.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="72">Subpart 1816.7_Agreements </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1816.703 Basic ordering agreements. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority:</T4> 42 U.S.C. 2473(c)(1).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="52">Subpart 1816.2_Fixed-Price Contracts </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="80">1816.202</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89"> Firm-fixed-price contracts. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="80">1816.202-70</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89"> NASA contract clause. </ITAG>The contracting officer shall insert the clause at 1852.216-78, Firm FixedPrice, in firm-fixed-price solicitations and contracts.

Requests for approval shallbe submitted to the Office of Procurement, NASA Headquarters (Code HC).(2) The factors in subdivisions (c)(2) (i) through (xiii) following shouldbe considered in preparing any price adjustment clause in situations meetingthe criteria of FAR 16.203-4(d):(i) The clause should not be overly complex.(ii) The clause normally should not provide either a ceiling or a floorfor adjustment unless adjustment is based on an index below the four-digitlevel of the Bureau of Labor Statistics Producer Price Index or the Wageand Income Series by Standard Industrial Classification (Labor).(iii) The clause normally should cover all potential economic fluctuationswithin the original contract period of performance.(iv)(A) The clause must positively and accurately identify the index(es)upon which adjustments will be based and must provide an alternative inthe event publication of the designated index is discontinued. The alternativemight include the substitution of another index, if the time remainingwould justify it and an appropriate index is reasonably available, or someother method for repricing the remaining portion of the work.(B) There should normally be no need to make an adjustment if computationof the identified index is altered; however, provision may be made to adjustthe economic fluctuation computations if the method of computing the indexis so substantially altered as to negate the original intent of the parties.When an index to be used is subject to revision (e.g., the Bureau of LaborStatistics Producer Price Indexes), the price adjustment clause shall furtherspecify that any adjustment shall be based upon the applicable revisedindex.(v) An index should be structured to encompass a large sample of relevantitems, yet bear a logical relationship to the type of contract costs measured.The basis of the index should not be so large and diverse that it is significantlyaffected by fluctuations not relevant to contract performance. But it mustbe broad enough to ensure that the effect created by any single company,including the anticipated contractors, is minimal. (vi) Not more than two indexes normally should be used; i.e., one for labor(direct and indirect) and one for material (direct and indirect).(vii) The clause must establish and properly identify a base period comparableto the contract periods for which adjustments are to be made, as a referencepoint for applying an index.(viii) The clause should provide for adjustment from the beginning of thecontract or for such period that the rate of expenditure is commensuratewith the administrative cost and effort of adjusting, but it should notprovide for adjustment beyond the original contract performance period.(ix) The expenditure profile for both labor and material should be basedon a predetermined rate of expenditure (expressed as the percentage ofmaterial or labor use as related to total contract price) in lieu of actualcost incurred. If the clause is to be used in a competitive procurement,the labor and material allocations, with regard to both mix and percentagerate of expenditure, shall be determined by the contracting officer ina manner approximating, as nearly as possible, the average-expenditureprofile of all companies likely to make offers. If the clause is to beused in a noncompetitive procurement, the labor and material allocationsdetermined by the contracting officer may be subject to negotiation andagreement.(x)(A) The clause should state the percentage of the contract price subjectto adjustment. Normally, adjustments are not applied to the profit portionof the contract.(B) Additionally, the labor and material portions of the contract mustbe examined to exclude areas not requiring adjustment. It may not be necessary,for example, to include all subcontracting, because some of the subcontractingcould be for short periods during the early life of the contract. It maybe possible to exclude certain areas of overhead from escalation protection;e.g., depreciation charges, prepaid insurance costs, rental costs, leases,certain taxes, and utility charges. Consideration also should be givento including economic-fluctuation protection covering that portion of laborfor the period for which a definitive union agreement exists without additionalfactoring for such things as cost-of-living increases.(C) Care should be taken to allocate to labor and material only those costslikely to be affected by fluctuations in the economy. That portion of thecontract determined to be proper for economic-fluctuation protection shallthen be allocated to specific periods (e.g., quarterly, semiannually) onthe basis of the most probable expenditure or commitment (expenditure profile).(xi) The clause should provide for definite times or positive events forprice adjustments. Adjustments should be of a frequency affording the contractorappropriate economic relief without creating a burdensome administrativeeffort. The adjustment period should normally range from a minimum of quarterlyto a maximum of annually. (xii) When the contract contains cost incentives, any sums paid to thecontractor because of economic price adjustments shall be subtracted fromthe total of the contractor's allowable cost for the purpose of establishingthe total costs to which the cost incentives apply. If the incentive arrangementis cited in percentage ranges rather than dollar ranges above and belowtarget costs, the economic price adjustment clause should be structuredto maintain the original contract incentive range in dollars. (xiii) The economic price adjustment clause should provide that once thelabor and material allocations have been established, they remain fixedthrough the life of the contract and are not modified unless the contractis partially terminated. The clause should state that pricing actions pursuantto the Changes clause or other provisions of the contract will be pricedas though there were no provision for economic price adjustment. (d) Consistent with the factors in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, andto allocate risk properly, the contracting officer may provide for certaineconomic price adjustment arrangements between the prime contractor andsubcontractors. In such circumstances, a requirement to incorporate priceadjustment clauses in specified subcontracts should be included in theprime contract's price adjustment clause. (e) When economic price adjustment clauses are included in contracts thatdo not require submission of cost or pricing data (see FAR 15.804-2 and15.804-3), the contracting officer shall obtain adequate information toestablish the baseline from which adjustments will be made. In addition,the contracting officer may require verification of this information tothe extent necessary to permit reliance upon it as a reasonable baseline.(f) The contracting officer shall insert the provision at 1852.216-72,Evaluation of Offers Subject to Economic Price Adjustment, in all solicitationsand contracts that contain an economic price adjustment clause. <ITAG tagnum="80">1816.207 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Firm-fixed-price, level-of-effort term contracts. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="80">1816.207-70 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">NASA contract clause. </ITAG>(a) The contracting officer shall insert a clause substantially as statedat 1852.216-79, Level-of-Effort (Fixed-Price), in fixed-price term solicitationsand contracts.

See Table 1825-2.(3) <T3>Example 3:</T3> Solicitation permits multiple awards, and FAR 25.105(c)permits application of the evaluation procedure in 25.105(a) on a groupor item-by-item basis. Each domestic offeror is a small business or laborsurplus area concern, requiring that the lowest acceptable foreign offerbe increased by 12 percent. When an award exceeding $250,000 would be madeto a domestic concern if the 12-percent factor were applied, but not ifthe 6-percent factor were applied, FAR 25.105(c) requires that the awardbe submitted to the agency head for decision as to whether award to thedomestic concern would involve unreasonable cost. In NASA, the Administratorhas delegated this authority to the Assistant Administrator for Procurement.See Table 1825-3.(i) For items 1 and 3, award would be made to the low acceptable domesticofferor, but would not be submitted to the Assistant Administrator forProcurement because_(A) The low acceptable domestic offeror is a small business and/or laborsurplus area concern;(B) The differential does not exceed 12 percent on an item-by-item basis;and(C) The total low acceptable domestic offer does not exceed $250,000.(ii) For items 2 and 4, award would be made to the low acceptable foreignofferor, but would not be submitted to the Assistant Administrator forProcurement because_(A) The low acceptable domestic offeror is a small business or labor surplusarea concern;(B) The differential exceeds 12 percent on an item-by-item basis; and (C) The low acceptable domestic offer does not exceed $250,000. (4) <T3>Example 4:</T3> Solicitation permits multiple awards, and FAR 25.105(b)permits application of the evaluation procedure in 25.105(a) on a groupor item-by-item basis. Each domestic offeror is a small business or laborsurplus area concern, requiring that the lowest acceptable foreign offerbe increased by 12 percent. When an award exceeding $250,000 would be madeto a domestic concern if the 12-percent factor were applied, but not ifthe 6-percent factor were applied, FAR 25.105(c) required that the awardbe submitted to the agency head for decision as to whether award to thedomestic concern would involve unreasonable cost. In NASA, the Administratorhas delegated this authority to the Assistant Administrator for Procurement.See Table 1825-4. (Note that both offers include transportation to destinationand the foreign offer includes duty.) (i) For the grouping of items 1, 2, 3, and 4, the proposed total wouldbe submitted to the Assistant Administrator for Procurement for decisionpursuant to FAR 25.105(c), which requires the agency head to decide whetheraward to a domestic concern would involve unreasonable cost when_(A) The low acceptable domestic offeror on each line item is a small businessor labor surplus area concern and the low acceptable foreign offer foreach line item must be increased for evaluation purposes by 12 percent(see FAR 25.105(a)(2)); (B) On an item-by-item basis, the low acceptable domestic price exceedsthe low acceptable foreign price plus 6 percent, but is less than the foreignprice plus 12 percent; or  (C) The grouping of the four line items for purposes of a single awardexceeds $250,000.  (ii) Table 1825-5 illustrates the pertinent figures in applying FAR 25.105(c).Columns 3 and 4 illustrate how award on each item would go to the domesticofferor if the 12-percent factor were added to the foreign offer. Additionof the 12-percent factor makes the foreign offer unreasonable. However,addition of only the 6-percent factor to the foreign offer makes the domesticoffer unreasonable in each case because, even with the addition of the6 percent, the foreign offer is still lower than the domestic one. Statedotherwise, because the low acceptable domestic offeror is a small businessor labor surplus area firm, the price of the low acceptable foreign offerormust be raised by 12 percent for evaluation purposes. Accordingly, eachevaluated price of items 1, 2, 3, and 4 exceeds the domestic price forthat item. However, in each case, if only the 6-percent factor is addedinstead of the 12-percent factor, the individual awards would go to theforeign offeror instead of the domestic offeror, thus requiring the procurementto be submitted to the Assistant Administrator for Procurement for a finaldecision as to whether award to the domestic concern would involve unreasonablecost. (b) <T3>Tie bids.</T3> If the evaluation procedure (that is, application ofdifferentials) set forth at FAR 25.105 results in a tie between the foreignoffer and the domestic offer, award shall be made to the domestic offeror.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Table </T4>1825-1 <H1> </H1><H1>Low bids </H1><H2>Domestic </H2><H2>Foreign</H2><ITAG tagnum="1">Cost to destination <D>$20,000 </D><D>$19,000 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Import duty <D> </D><D>600 </D><R>n,sandCx.3;</R></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="3">Total </ITAG><D>$20,000 </D><D>$19,600 </D><ITAG tagnum="1">Six percent differential <D> </D><D>1,176 </D><R>n,sandCx.3;</R></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="3">Total </ITAG><D>$20,000 </D><D>$20,776 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L2,i1,s10,8,8</C><T4>Table </T4>1825-2 <H1> </H1><H1>Low bids </H1><H2>Domestic </H2><H2>Foreign</H2><ITAG tagnum="1">Cost to destination <D>$20,000 </D><D>$17,000 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Import duty <D> </D><D>500 </D><R>n,sandCx.3;</R></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="3">Total </ITAG><D>$20,000 </D><D>$17,500 </D><ITAG tagnum="1">Six percent differential<D> </D><D>1,050 </D><R>n,sandCx.3;</R></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="3">Total </ITAG><D>$20,000 </D><D>$18,550 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="110"><C>5,L2,i1,s10,7,7,7,10</C><T4>Table </T4>1825-3 <H1>Item </H1><H1>Low Bids</H1><H2>Foreign </H2><H2>Domestic</H2><H3>A</H3><H3>B </H3><H1>Actual percent difference between bids</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">1 <D>$50,000 </D><D>$55,500 </D><D> </D><D>11 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">2 <D>50,000 </D><D> </D><D>$56,500 </D><D>13 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">3 <D>75,000 </D><D>81,750 </D><D> </D><D>9 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">4 <D>12,000 </D><D> </D><D>16,250 </D><D>30</D></ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Table</T4> 1825-4 <H1>Item </H1><H1>Low bids </H1><H2>Foreign </H2><H2>Domestic </H2><H1>Actual percent  difference between  bids</H1> <ITAG tagnum="1">1 <D>$100,000 </D><D>$111,000 </D><D>11 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">2 <D>200,000 </D><D>220,000 </D><D>10 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">3 <D>50,000 </D><D>55,000 </D><D>10 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">4 <D>25,000 </D><D>27,000 </D><D>8</D></ITAG></ITAG> <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>6,L2,s25,8,8,8,8,8</C><T4>Table</T4> 1825-5 <H1>Item </H1><H1>1 </H1><H2>Foreign bid </H2><H1>2</H1><H2>Foreign bid plus 6% </H2><H1>3 </H1><H2>Domestic bid </H2><H1>4 </H1><H2>Foreign bid plus 12%</H2><H1>5 </H1><H2>Actual percentage difference of domestic bid over foreign bid</H2><ITAG tagnum="1">1 <D>$100,000 </D><D>$106,000 </D><D>$111,000 </D><D>$112,000 </D><D>11 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">2 <D>200,000 </D><D>212,000 </D><D>220,000 </D><D>224,000 </D><D>10 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">3 <D>50,000 </D><D>53,000 </D><D>55,000 </D><D>56,000 </D><D>10 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">4 <D>25,000 </D><D>26,500 </D><D>27,000 </D><D>28,000 </D><D>8</D><R>n,s,n,s,nandCx.3;</R></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG><D>$375,000 </D><D/><D>$413,000</D></ITAG> <ITAG tagnum="52">Subpart 1825.2_Buy American Act_Construction Materials</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="80">1825.202</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Policy. </ITAG>(a) <T3>Exception for unreasonable cost of domestic construction materials.</T3>The Assistant Administrator for Procurement has determined that when theapplication of the procedure set forth in 1825.203 results in the acquisitionof foreign construction materials, the use of domestic construction materialswould unreasonably increase the cost.(b) <T3>Exception for impracticability of using domestic construction materials.</T3>The Assistant Administrator for Procurement has determined that, when thereis a justification as required by FAR 25.203(b), the use of domestic constructionmaterial would be impracticable.(c) <T3>Exception for nonavailability of domestic construction materials.</T3>(1) NASA has determined that construction materials listed in FAR 25.108(d)(1)are not mined, produced, or manufactured in the United States in sufficientand reasonably available commercial quantities of a satisfactory quality.(2) In addition, subject to the approval of the head of the contractingactivity where required (see FAR 25.202(b)), NASA contracting officersmay make additional determinations of nonavailability under FAR 25.202(a)(3)both before entering into contracts and in the course of contract administration;provided, however, that in the latter case the Government receives adequateconsideration.

(2) NASA policy with respect to any invention made in the performance ofexperimental, developmental, or research work with a small business firmor a nonprofit organization is based on 35 U.S.C. Chapter 18, as amended.The objectives of NASA policy with respect to any NASA contract subjectto Section 305 of the Act are to obtain the prompt reporting of inventions,discoveries, improvements, and innovations made in the performance of anywork thereunder (whether or not patentable) in order to protect the Government'sinterest in them and to provide their widest practicable and appropriatedissemination, early utilization, expeditious development, and continuedavailability for the benefit of the scientific, industrial, and commercialcommunities and the general public. (3) In addition, the objectives of NASA policy with respect to inventionsmade in the performance of work under all NASA contracts are to use thepatent system to promote the utilization of inventions arising from federallysupported research or development; to encourage maximum participation ofindustry in federally funded research and development efforts; to ensurethat these inventions are used in a manner to promote full and open competitionand free enterprise; to promote the commercialization and public availabilityof the inventions made in the United States by United States industry andlabor; to ensure that the Government obtains sufficient rights in federallysupported inventions to meet the needs of the Government and protect thepublic against nonuse or unreasonable use of inventions; and to minimizethe cost of administering policies in this area. (b) <T3>Contractor right to title. </T3>(1) With respect to any NASA contractwith other than a small business firm or a nonprofit organization (contractssubject to section 305 of the Act; see paragraph (d) of this section, itis the policy of NASA to waive the rights (to acquire title) of the UnitedStates (with the reservation of a Government license set forth in paragraph(c) of this section and the march-in rights of paragraph (f) of this sectionin and to any invention made in the performance of work under the contractif the Administrator determines that the interests of the United Stateswill be served by this action. This policy, as well as the procedures andinstructions for such waiver of rights, is stated in the NASA Patent WaiverRegulations, 14 CFR Part 1245, Subpart 1. These regulations adopt the PresidentialMemorandum on Government Patent Policy of February 18, 1983, as a guidein acting on a contractor's request for such waiver of rights (i.e., requestfor title). Waiver may be requested in advance of contract award for anyor all of the inventions that may be made under the contract, or for individuallyidentified inventions reported under the contract. When waiver of rightsis granted, the contractor's right to title, the rights reserved by theGovernment, and other conditions and obligations of the waiver shall beincluded in an Instrument of Waiver executed by NASA and the party receivingthe waiver. (2) With respect to any contract with a small business firm or a nonprofitorganization, the contractor's right to receive title is as stated in FAR27.302(b). (3) It is also a policy of NASA to consider for a monetary award, whenreferred to the NASA Inventions and Contributions Board, any inventionmade in the performance of a NASA contract and reported to NASA in accordancewith this subpart, and for which an application for patent has been filed.(c) <T3>Government license. </T3>(1) For each invention made in the performanceof work under any NASA contract with other than a small business firm ora nonprofit organization and for which waiver of rights has been grantedin accordance with 14 CFR Part 1245, Subpart 1, the Administrator shallreserve an irrevocable, nonexclusive, nontransferable, royalty-free licensefor the practice of such invention throughout the world by or on behalfof the United States or any foreign government in accordance with any treatyor agreement with the United States. (2) For any invention made in the performance of work under any contractnot subject to the Government license of subparagraph (c)(1) of this section,FAR 27.302(c) shall apply. (d) <T3>Government right to receive title. </T3>(1) Under section 305(a) ofthe Act (42 U.S.C. 2457(a)), any invention made in the performance of workunder a NASA contract becomes the exclusive property of the United Stateswhen certain determinations stated in the Act relating to the employmentstatus of the person making the inventions are made, unless the Administratorwaives all or any part of the rights. NASA has adopted the PresidentialMemorandum on Government Patent Policy of February 18, 1983, as a guidein acting on a contractor's request for waiver (see paragraph (b) of thissection). (2) Thus, NASA acquires title to any subject invention under any NASA contractwith other than a small business firm or a nonprofit organization (i.e.,those contracts subject to section 305(a) of the Act) unless waiver hasbeen granted and made applicable to that invention. Such contracts arerequired to contain the clause at 1852.227-70, New Technology. Paragraph(b) of that clause sets forth the circumstances under which NASA acquirestitle to a subject invention under section 305(a). When waiver is granted,the contractor's right to title will be included in an Instrument of Waiverexecuted by NASA and the party receiving the waiver. (3) With respect to any contract with a small business firm or a nonprofitorganization, FAR 27.302(d) shall apply. (e) <T3>Utilization reports. </T3>FAR 27.302(e) shall apply, except that forany NASA contract with other than a small business firm or a nonprofitorganization, the requirements for utilization reports shall be as setforth in the NASA Patent Waiver Regulations, 14 CFR Part 1245, Subpart1, and any Instrument of Waiver executed under those regulations. (f) <T3>March-in rights. </T3>FAR 27.302(f) shall apply, except that for anyNASA contract with other than a small business firm or a nonprofit organization,the march-in rights shall be as set forth in the NASA Patent Waiver Regulations,14 CFR Part 1245, Subpart 1, and any Instrument of Waiver executed underthose regulations. (g) <T3>Preference for United States industry. </T3>FAR 27.302(g) shall apply,except that with respect to any NASA contract with other than a small businessfirm or a nonprofit organization, any waiver of the requirements of FAR27.302(g) shall be in accordance with the NASA Patent Waiver Regulations,14 CFR Part 1245, Subpart 1. (h) <T3>Minimum rights to contractor.</T3> (1) With respect to any NASA contractwith other than a small business firm or a nonprofit organization, foreach reported subject invention to which the Government acquires title,the contractor is normally granted (in accordance with 14 CFR Part 1245,Subpart 1) a revocable, nonexclusive, royalty-free license in each patentapplication filed in any country and in any resulting patent. The licenseextends to any of the contractor's domestic subsidiaries and affiliateswithin the corporate structure of which the contractor is a part, and includesthe right to grant sublicenses of the same scope to the extent the contractorwas legally obligated to do so at the time the contract was awarded. Thelicense and right are transferable only with the approval of the Administrator,except when transferred to the successor of that part of the contractor'sbusiness to which the invention pertains.(2) The contractor's domestic license granted in accordance with subparagraph(h)(1) of this section may be revoked or modified by the Administratorto the extent necessary to achieve expeditious practical application ofthe subject invention pursuant to an application for an exclusive licensesubmitted in accordance with 14 CFR Part 1245, Subpart 2, Licensing ofNASA Inventions. This license will not be revoked in any field of use orgeographical area in which the contractor has achieved practical applicationand continues to make the benefits of the invention reasonably accessibleto the public. The license in any foreign country may be revoked or modifiedat the discretion of the Administrator to the extent that the contractor,its licensees, or its domestic subsidiaries or affiliates have failed toachieve practical application in that country. The procedures for revocationor modification of any license, domestic or foreign, shall be in accordancewith 14 CFR 1245.211.(3) With respect to any contract with a small business firm or a nonprofitorganization, FAR 27.302(h) shall apply.(i) <T3>Confidentiality of inventions.</T3> FAR 27.302(i) shall apply. <ITAG tagnum="80">1827.373</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Contract clauses and solicitation provisions.</ITAG>(a) <T3>Patent rights_retention by the contractor (short form).</T3> (1) Thecontracting officer shall insert the clause at FAR 52.227-11, Patent Rights_Retentionby the Contractor (Short Form), in any contract (and solicitation therefor)with a small business firm or a nonprofit organization for the performanceof experimental, developmental, or research work unless a determinationis made to use another clause in accordance with one of the exceptionsset forth in paragraph (c) of this section. The clause shall be modifiedas specified in (a)(4) of this section. Also, see paragraph (f) of thissection and 1827.374-4.(2) If the acquisition of patent rights for the benefit of a foreign governmentis required under a treaty or executive agreement, or if the Administratordetermines at the time of contracting that it would be in the nationalinterest to acquire the right to sublicense foreign governments or internationalorganizations pursuant to any existing or to-be-entered-into treaty oragreement, the contracting officer shall use the clause with its AlternateI.(3) To qualify for the clause at FAR 52.227-11, a prospective contractormay be required to certify that it is either a small business firm or anonprofit organization. If there is reason to question the status of theprospective contractor, the contracting officer may file a protest in accordancewith 13 CFR 121.3-5 if small business firm status is questioned or requiresthe prospective contractor to furnish evidence of its status as a nonprofitorganization.(4) When the clause at FAR 52.227-11 is included in a solicitation or contract,include the following subparagraphs in paragraph (f):(5) The Contractor shall furnish the Contracting Officer the following:(i) Interim reports every 12 months (or such longer period as the ContractingOfficer may specify) from the date of the contract, listing subject inventionsmade during that period and certifying that all have been disclosed orthat there are none.(ii) A final report, within 3 months after completion of the contractedwork, listing all subject inventions or certifying that there were none,and listing all subcontracts at any tier that contain a patent rights clauseor certifying that there were none.(6) The Contractor shall promptly notify the Contracting Officer in writingupon the award of any subcontract at any tier containing a patent rightsclause, by identifying the subcontractor, the applicable patent rightsclause, the work to be performed under the subcontract, and the dates ofaward and estimated completion. Upon the Contracting Officer's request,the Contractor shall furnish a copy of that subcontract, and no more frequentlythan annually, a listing of the subcontracts that have been awarded.(7) The Contractor shall provide, upon request, the filing date, serialnumber, and title; a copy of the patent application (including an Englishlanguage version if filed in a language other than English); and the patentnumber and issue date for any subject invention for which the Contractorhas retained title. (8) Upon request, the Contractor shall furnish the Government an irrevocablepower to inspect and make copies of the patent application file.(b) <T3>New technology.</T3> As authorized in FAR 27.303(c)(2), the contractingofficer shall insert the clause at 1852.227-70, New Technology, in anyNASA contract (and solicitation therefor) with other than a small businessfirm or a nonprofit organization, if the contract is to be performed inthe United States, its possessions, or Puerto Rico and has as a purposethe performance of experimental, developmental, research, design, or engineeringwork (see also 1827.374-3 and 1827.374-4).

This effort should be directed primarily toward contractsand subcontracts that, by the nature of the work to be performed or thedollar amounts involved, are likely to produce reportable items or subjectinventions of significant quantity or quality, or toward contracts andsubcontracts under which there is reason to believe that the contractorsmay not be complying with their contractual obligations. Other contractsand subcontracts should be spot-checked when feasible. These follow-upactivities may include_(1) Reviewing the contractor's technical reports; (2) Requesting the Patent Representative to check sources for patents issuedto the contractor in fields related to the contractor's Government contracts;(3) Interviewing contractor personnel regarding work under the contract,observing the work on-site, and inspecting laboratory notebooks and othercontractor records related to work under the contract, to the extent authorizedby the clause; (4) Interviewing agency technical personnel concerning novel developmentsin contracts under their cognizance; and (5) Ensuring that the contractor is timely in reporting reportable items,disclosing subject inventions, and submitting interim reports, subcontractidentification, and final reports as required by the clause.

As to any subject invention, the Patent Representative shall:(1) Ensure that the contractor has provided sufficient information to protectthe Government's rights and interests in it and to permit the preparation,filing, and prosecution of patent applications, (2) Make determinations of inventorship, and (3) Ensure the preparation of instruments establishing the Government'srights.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">The Patent Representative shall also, as necessary, conduct selectedreviews of the nature set forth in paragraph (a) of this section to ensurethat subject inventions are identified, adequately documented, and timelyreported or disclosed. (d) Upon receipt of any final report required by the clause, and upon determinationthat the contract work is complete, the New Technology Representative shalldetermine whether the contractor has complied with the clause's reportingrequirements. If so, the New Technology Representative shall certify compliance,obtain the Patent Representative's concurrence, and forward the certificationto the contracting officer. Such determinations generally will requireconsultation with cognizant technical personnel. (e) Either the New Technology Representative or the Patent Representative,in consultation with the other, may prepare opinions, make determinations,and otherwise advise the contracting officer with respect to any withholdingof payment under paragraph (g) of the New Technology clause. Either theNew Technology Representative or the Patent Representative may representthe contracting officer for the purpose of examining the contractor's books,records, and other documents in accordance with paragraph (f) of the NewTechnology clause and take corrective action as appropriate. However, noaction may be taken by either the New Technology Representative or thePatent Representative that would: (1) Constitute a final decision under the Disputes clause, (2) Involve any change or increase in the work required to be performedunder the contract that is inconsistent with any right of appeal providedin FAR 27.304-5 or 14 CFR 1245.1, or (3) Otherwise be outside the scope of obligations imposed upon the contractorby the contract. (f) If it is determined that a contractor or subcontractor does not clearlyunderstand the rights and obligations of the parties under a patent rightsclause, or that its procedures for complying with the clause are deficient,a post-award orientation should ordinarily be conducted to explain theserights and obligations (see FAR Subpart 42.5). When a contractor failsto establish, maintain, or follow effective procedures for identifying,disclosing, and, when appropriate, filing patent applications on inventions(if such procedures are required by the patent rights clause), or afterappropriate notice fails to correct any deficiency, the contracting officeror a representative may require the contractor to make available for examinationbooks, records, and documents relating to the contractor's inventions inthe same field of technology as the contract effort to enable a determinationof whether there are such inventions and may invoke the withholding ofpayments provision (if any) of the clause. The withholding of paymentsprovision (if any) of the patent rights clause or of any other contractclause may also be invoked if the contractor fails to disclose a subjectinvention. Significant or repeated failures by a contractor to comply withthe patent rights obligation in its contracts shall be documented and madea part of the general file (see FAR 4.801(c)(3)).

Any permission granted in accordance with subdivision(e)(2)(i) or (e)(2)(ii) of this section shall be by express contract provision(or amendment) overriding subparagraph (d)(3) rather than by deleting subparagraph(d)(3) from the clause. Any permission granted in accordance with subdivision(2)(iii) of this section may be either by deleting subparagraph (d)(3)or by special contract provision, as appropriate. Any contract provisionrelating to any permission granted in accordance with subdivision (2)(i)or (2)(ii) of this section may contain appropriate assurances that thecomputer software will be incorporated into an existing or proposed newcommercial computer software product line within a reasonable time and/orthat the agreed contributions to the Government are fulfilled, with contingenciesenabling the Government itself to obtain the right to distribute the softwarefor commercial use, including the right to obtain assignment of copyrightwhere applicable, in order to prevent the computer software from beingsuppressed or abandoned by the contractor. Also, when any permission tocopyright is granted, any copyright license retained by the Governmentshall be of the same scope as set forth in subparagraph (c)(1) of the clause(see also FAR 27.404(f)(1)) and without any obligation of confidentialityon the part of the Government, unless in accordance with subdivision (e)(2)(ii)of this section the contributions of the Contractor may be considered ``substantial''for the purposes of FAR 27.408 (i.e., approximately 50 percent), in whichcase rights consistent with FAR 27.408 may be negotiated for the computersoftware in question.

This procedure is to facilitate receivingapplicable information and is not intended to alter any NASA rights orobligations set forth in the clause or elsewhere in the contract. The price,schedule, and other terms, if any, are to be specified in the purchaseorder or contract. (2) When the clause at 52.227-19, Commercial Computer Software_RestrictedRights, is used, NASA paragraph (f) (see 1827.409(g)) may be added to incorporateapplicable portions of the contractor's standard commercial license orlease agreement into the purchase order/contract to the extent consistentwith the clause, Federal laws, standard industry practices, and the FAR.(3) Instead of the clause at FAR 52.227-19, Commercial Computer Software_RestrictedRights (either with or without additional paragraphs (e) and/or (f)), thecontracting officer may use the NASA clause at 1852.227-86, CommercialComputer Software_Licensing. This clause is particularly useful when thereare multiple computers on which the computer software may be used, butsimultaneous use is prohibited or restricted in the vendor/contractor standardcommercial software license to be incorporated in and made part of thepurchase order/contract. It also automatically adopts terms in the vendor/contractorstandard commercial license that may be less restrictive than those setforth in the clause at FAR 52.227-19 without having to customize that clauseor modify the purchase order/contract. In addition, it enables the vendor/contractor'sstandard marking to be used without requiring additional markings on thesoftware.

Cost of money factors (CMF)by overhead pools at the business unit are developed using Form CASB-CMF.Three elements are required to develop cost of money overhead allocationbase date, and the interest rate promulgated by the Secretary of the Treasurypursuant to Pub. L. 92-41. These elements are discussed below.(a) <T3>Business unit facilities capital data.</T3> (1) The net book value(acquisition cost less accumulated depreciation) is used for each costaccounting period. The net book value used is the total of:(i) The net book value of facilities recorded on the accounting recordsof the business unit,(ii) The capitalized value of leases (see FAR 31.205-2 and FAR 31.205-36),and(iii) The net book value of facilities at the corporate or group levelthat support depreciation charges allocated to the business unit underthe provisions of CAS 403.(2) Projections of facilities capital will be supported by budget plansand/or similar type documentation and the estimated depreciation will bethe same as used in projected overhead rates. Projections will accommodatechanges in the level of facilities net book value, e.g., facilities additions,deletions of facilities by sale, abandonment or other disposal, idle facilities(see FAR 31.205-17). (b) <T3>Overhead allocation bases. </T3>The base data used to compute the CMFmust be the same as that used to compute the proposed overhead rates. CMFsshould be submitted and evaluated as part of the proposal. (c) <T3>Interest rate. </T3>For purpose of projection, the most recent interestrate promulgated by the Secretary of the Treasury will be used as the costof money rate in Column 1 of Form CASB-CMF and the same rate must be usedon the DD Form 1861 to determine contract facilities capital employed.Where actual costs are used in definitization actions, the actual treasuryrate(s) applicable to the period(s) of the incurred costs will be recognizedby development of a composite rate. (d) <T3>Determination of final cost of money. </T3>CMFs estimated followingthe above procedures are used to develop the facilities investment baseused in forward pricing. Actual CMFs are required when it is necessaryto determine final allowable costs for cost settlement and/or repricingfollowing CAS 414 and FAR 31.205-10. <ITAG tagnum="80">1830.7001-4 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Contract facilities capital estimates. </ITAG>(a) After the appropriate Forms CASB-CMF have been analyzed and CMFs havebeen developed, the contracting officer is in a position to estimate thefacilities capital cost of money and capital employed for a contract proposal.DD Form 1861 ``Contract Facilities Capital and Cost of Money'' has beenprovided for this purpose and, when properly completed, becomes a connectinglink between the Forms CASB-CMF and any applicable agency structured approachto determination of profit or fee objectives. An evaluated contract costbreakdown reduced to the contracting officer's pre-negotiation cost objectivemust be available. The procedure is similar to applying overhead ratesto appropriate overhead allocation bases to determine contract overheadcosts. (b) DD Form 1861 provides for listing overhead pools and direct-chargingservice centers (if used) in the same structure they appear on the contractor'scost proposal and Forms CASB-CMF. The structure and allocation base units-of-measuremust be compatible on all three displays. The base for each overhead poolmust be broken down by year to match each separate Form CASB-CMF. Appropriatecontract overhead allocation base data are extracted by year from the evaluatedcost breakdown or pre-negotiation cost objective, and are listed againsteach separate Form CASB-CMF. Each allocation base is multiplied by itscorresponding cost of money factor, to get the Facilities Capital Costof Money estimated to be incurred each year. The sum of these productsrepresents the estimated Contract Facilities Capital Cost of Money forthe Year's effort. Total contract facilities cost of money is the sum ofthe yearly amounts. (c) Since the Facilities Capital Cost of Money Factors reflect the applicablecost of money rate in Column 1 of Form CASB-CMF, the Contract FacilitiesCapital Employed can be determined by dividing the contract Cost of Moneyby the same rate. DD Form 1861 is designed to record and compute all theabove in the most direct way possible, and the end result is the ContractFacilities Capital Cost of Money and Capital Employed which is carriedforward to the applicable agency structured approach to determination ofprofit or fee objectives. <ITAG tagnum="80">1830.7001-5 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Pre-award facilities capital applications. </ITAG>Facilities Capital Cost of Money as determined above is applied in establishingcost and price objectives as follows: (a) <T3>Cost of money</T3>_(1) <T3>Cost objective. </T3>This special, imputed cost of money shall be used,together with normal, booked costs, in establishing a cost objective orthe target cost when structuring an incentive type contract.

Like appliedoverhead at forecasted overhead rates, such computations are interim estimatessubject to adjustment. As each year's data are finalized by computationof the actual Cost of Money Factors under CAS 414 and FAR 31.205-10, thenew factors should be used to calculate contract facilities cost of moneyfor the next accounting period. (b) <T3>Final settlement. </T3>Contract Facilities Capital Cost of Money forfinal cost determination or repricing is based on each year's final Costof Money Factors determined under CAS 414 and supported by separate FormCASB-CMF. Contract cost must be separately computed in a manner similarto yearly final overhead rates.

If the contractor does not annually negotiateFPRAs, submissions may nevertheless be made annually or with individualcontract pricing proposals, as agreed to by the contractor and the cognizantcontract administration office. The cognizant contract administration officeshall, with the assistance of the cognizant auditor, evaluate the costof money factors, and retain approved factors with other negotiated forwardpricing data and rates. (b) The contracting officer will complete a DD Form 1861, Contract FacilitiesCapital and Cost of Money, after evaluating the contractor's cost proposaland determining the pre-negotiation cost objective, but before determiningthe pre-negotiation profit objective. The contracting officer may requestthe cognizant contract administration office to complete the DD Form 1861in connection with normal field pricing support under FAR 15.805-5, andinclude it in field pricing support report with appropriate evaluationcomments and recommendations. (c) A final Form CASB-CMF must be submitted by the contractor under CAS414 as soon after the end of each cost accounting period as possible, forthe purpose of final cost determinations and/or repricing.

The sum of the productsis divided by the total number of months in which the rates were experienced.(d) <T3>Representative investment. </T3>The representative investment is thecalculate amount considered invested by the contractor in the project toconstruct, fabricate, or develop the asset during the cost accounting period.In calculating the representative investment, consideration must be givento the rate or expenditure pattern of the investment, i.e., if most ofthe investment was at the end of the cost accounting period, the representativeinvestment calculation must reflect this fact. (1) If the contractor experiences an irregular or uneven expenditure patternin the construction, fabrication, or development of a capital asset, i.e.,a majority of the construction costs were incurred toward the beginning,middle, or end of the cost accounting period, the contractor must either:(i) Determine a representative investment amount for the cost accountingperiod by calculating the average of the month-end balances for that costaccounting period; or (ii) Treat month-end balances as individual representative investment amounts.(2) If the construction, fabrication, or development costs were incurredin a fairly uniform expenditure pattern throughout the construction period,the contractor may:(i) Determine a representative investment amount for the cost accountingperiod by averaging the beginning and ending balances of the construction,fabrication, or development cost account for the cost accounting period,or (ii) Treat month-end balances as individual representative investment amounts.<ITAG tagnum="80">1830.7002-3 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Measurement. </ITAG>(a) The imputed cost of money for an asset under construction, fabrication,or development is calculated by applying a cost of money rate (see 1830.7002-2(c)),to the representative investment amount (see 1830.7002-2(d)). (1) When a representative investment amount is determined for a cost accountingperiod following 1830.7002-2(d)(1)(i) or 1830.7002-2(d)(2)(i), the costof money rate used shall be the time-weighted average rate. (2) When a monthly representative investment amount (see 1830.7002-2(d)(1)(ii)or 1830.7002-2(d)(ii)) is used, the cost of money rate shall be the ratein effect each month.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Note: </T4>Under this method, the cost of money calculating is mademonthly and the total for the cost accounting period is the sum of themonthly calculations.) </ITAG>(b) The method chosen by a contractor for determining the representativeinvestment amount may be different for each capital asset being constructed,fabricated, or developed as long as the method fits the expenditure patternof the construction costs incurred. (c) The imputed cost of money will be capitalized only once in any costaccounting period; either at the end of the period or at the end of theconstruction period, whichever comes first. (d) When the construction of an asset takes more than one cost accountingperiod, the cost of money capitalized for the first cost accounting periodwill be included in determining the repre-sentative investment amount forany future cost accounting periods. <ITAG tagnum="80">1830.7002-4 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Composition and allocation of costs. </ITAG>(a) The cost of money for a tangible capital asset determined following1830.7002-2 and 1830.7002-3 shall be capitalized along with the other construction,fabrication, or development cost of that asset for purposes of depreciationunder FAR 31.205-11. (b) The cost of money for an intangible capital asset determined following1830.7002-2 and 1830.7002-3 shall be capitalized along with other construction,fabrication, or development costs of that asset and amortized over appropriatecost accounting periods.

Phase B usually covers the explorationof design concepts while Phase C/D deals with developing and fabricatingequipment in accordance with designs that have proven acceptable. In suchprocurements, where Phase B is subject to full and open competition andall offerors are made aware that a continuous process of ``down-selection''will be used, then the subsequent C/D solicitation and award are consideredto be a continuum of the initial competition (Phase B) and the entire processis considered full and open competition. To this end, Phase B should besynopsized in accordance with FAR 5.201 and solicit all known potentialsources to explore design concepts. In addition to the other informationrequired by FAR 5.207, the synopsis should state that the subsequent solicitationfor Phase C/D will build on the design concepts selected in Phase B andthat NASA intends to solicit offers on that procurement only from thosefirms which were successful in Phase B. The Phase B RFP should also includethis statement.(b) Solicitations must be issued for Phase C/D and a source selection accomplished,unless an appropriate Justification for Other Than Full and Open Competitionhas been approved; ``technical'' down-selection from Phase B to Phase C/Dwithout the issuance of a Phase C/D solicitation is not appropriate. Solicitationsfor Phase C/D should be limited to those firms which successfully completedPhase B or to those which can otherwise demonstrate that they meet thedesign requirements of Phase B. Procurements for Phase C/D must be properlysynopsized, and state that it is the second phase of a phased procurementand that the Phase C/D solicitation is being issued to the offerors whosuccessfully completed the Phase B design requirements, and identify thefirms which are being solicited for Phase C/D. The synopsis must also statethat any other potential offeror for Phase C/D must meet the Phase B requirement.If a prospective offeror, other than a successful contractor in Phase B,responds to the synopsis, the contracting officer shall allow the offerorto compete, but caution the interested firm that any product offered mustsatisfy the requirement for an equivalent mature design concept acceptableto NASA delineated in Phase B.(c) Phased procurements which meet the conditions in paragraphs (a) and(b) of this section are considered to be full and open competition. Ifonly one contractor successfully completed Phase B and, after solicitingoffers from more than one source, no other potential offeror respondedto the solicitation for Phase C/D, the award shall be reported as a ``noncompetitiveprocurement using competitive procedures'' (see 1804.671-4(m)).(d) When the conditions in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section can notbe met or where NASA chooses to develop an independent design after PhaseB products have been evaluated, the procurement should proceed on the basisof full and open competition unless circumstances justify using one ofthe exceptions set forth in FAR 6.302 or one of the exclusions under FARSubpart 6.2. In any event, the synopsis requirements of FAR 5.201 apply.(For this purpose, an ``independent design'' can be:(1) A synthesis of the Phase B products;(2) A totally new design developed by NASA; or(3) A combination thereof.)<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 1835_RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT CONTRACTING </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="70">Sec.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1835.003 Policy. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1835.003-70 Scientific and Technical Information  Service. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1835.003-71 Plan for New Technology Reporting. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1835.014 Government property and title. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1835.015 Contracts for research with educational  institutions andnonprofit  organizations. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1835.016 Broad agency announcements. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1835.016-70 NASA Research Announcements. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1835.070 NASA contract clauses and solicitation  provision. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1835.071 Space Transportation System Personnel  Reliability Program.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority: </T4>42 U.S.C. 2473(c)(1).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="80">1835.003 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Policy. </ITAG>(a) See NHB 5800.1, NASA Grant and Cooperative Agreement Handbook, forpolicy regarding the use of grants and cooperative agreements.

An NRA is used to announceNASA's research interests and, after peer or scientific review using factorsin the NRA, select proposals for funding. Unlike an RFP containing a statementof work or specification to which offerors are to respond, an NRA providesfor the submission of competitive project ideas, conceived by the offerors,in one or more program areas of interest to NASA. The NRA is intended tobe used for those research procurements for which it would be impossibleto draft an adequate RFP in sufficient detail without restraining the technicalresponse and thus hindering the competition of ideas, rather than expandingcompetition. Consequently, an NRA shall not be used in place of an RFPwhen the procurement requirement is narrowly defined and it is necessaryto use a detailed description or specification. (b) <T3>Issuance. </T3>(1) Each NRA shall be assigned a unique number in accordancewith 184.7102-1. (2) NRAs may remain open for proposal submission for a maximum of one year.They may not be amended or modified once issued, but may be reissued byassigning a new number and resynopsizing. (See also paragraph (g) of thissection.) NRAs should remain open for at least 90 days. (3) Before issuance, each field-generated NRA shall be concurred in bythe procurement officer and approved by the installation's director ora designee, who shall serve as or designate a selecting official. Beforeissuance, each Headquarters-generated NRA shall be concurred in by GeneralCounsel (Code GK) and the Director, Headquarters Grants and Contracts Division(Code HW) and approved by the cognizant Program Associate Administratoror a designee, who shall serve as or designate a selecting official. Ifa Headquarters-generated NRA may result in awards by a NASA field installation,the concurrence of that installation's procurement officer may be soughtin place of or in addition to Code HW's concurrence. (4) The contracting officer shall assure that the NRA is synopsized inthe Commerce Business Daily (CBD). The CBD synopsis required by FAR 35.016(c)satisfies the synopsis requirement at FAR 5.201; the synopsis contemplatedby FAR 5.205 is not required. The synopsis shall be brief and provide theaddress for obtaining a copy of the detailed NRA. The technical part ofthe synopsis is intended to describe an identifiable area of interest andshould not exceed 50 words. (5) The NRA shall be prepared, printed, and distributed by or under thedirection of the selecting official. Distribution shall not begin untilthe concurrence of the procurement officer has been obtained and the contractingofficer has confirmed that the synopsis requirements have been met. TheNRA shall be distributed to each coordinating office responsible for receiptof unsolicited proposals and to the Office of Procurement (Code HS). (6) In addition to the concurrences and approvals in subparagraph (b)(3)of this section, each installation shall submit its first two NRAs to theAssistant Administrator for Procurement (Code HS) for concurrence beforeissuance.

A brief description not exceeding two pages is preferable,but it should be detailed enough to enable ready comprehension of the researchareas of interest to NASA. Specifications containing detailed statementsof work more suited to RFPs should be avoided. Any program management informationincluded must be limited to matters that are essential for proposal preparation.(4) <T3>Instructions for Responding to NASA Research Announcements for SolicitedResearch Proposals. </T3>The NRA shall contain instructions in accordancewith 1870.203. (d) <T3>Unsolicited proposals. </T3>(1) Unsolicited proposals for new effortsthat are within the scope of an open NRA shall be evaluated in accordancewith 1815.506(b). (2) Unsolicited proposals for renewal of ongoing efforts that are withinthe scope of an open NRA shall be evaluated in accordance with 1815.505-70.(3) A broad agency announcement shall not be considered to be an ``acquisitionrequirement'' as the term is used in FAR 15.507(a)(2). (e) <T3>Receipt of proposals, evaluation, and selection. </T3>(1) Proposalsshall be protected as provided in 1815.508-70 and 1815.509-70. (2) Evaluation, selection, and award may occur during or after the periodestablished for receipt of proposals. Late proposals and modificationsshall be treated in accordance with 1815.412 (a) and (b). (3) When more than one time is established in the NRA for evaluating proposals,proposals received prior to the time established will be considered aspart of the initial group to be evaluated. Subsequent groups of proposalsto be evaluated shall be formed from those proposals received after thetime established for the earlier evaluation groups and prior to the timeestablished for a subsequent group, along with those proposals, if any,held over under subparagraph (e)(8) of this section. (4) The selection decision shall be made following peer or scientific reviewof a proposal. Peer or scientific review shall involve (i) evaluation,outside NASA, by a discipline specialist in the area of the proposal, (ii)evaluation by an in-house specialist, or (iii) both. Evaluation by specialistsoutside NASA shall be conducted subject to the conditions in FAR 15.413-2(f)and NFS 1815.413 and 1815.413-2. In particular, the selecting officialshall ensure compliance with FAR 15.413-2(f)(5) regarding the designationof outside evaluators and avoidance of conflicts of interest. After receiptof a proposal and before selection, scientific or engineering personnelshall communicate with an offeror, regarding the proposal, only for thepurpose of clarification, as defined in FAR 15.601, or in order to understandthe meaning of some aspect of the proposal that is not clear, or in orderto obtain confirmation or substantiation of a proposed approach, solution,or cost estimate. (5) Competitive range determinations shall not be made, and best and finaloffers shall not be requested. (6) All or part of a proposal may be selected unless the offeror requestsotherwise. In addition, changes to a selected proposal may be sought aslong as (i) the ideas or other aspects of the proposal on which selectionis based are contained in the proposal as originally submitted, and arenot introduced by the changes; and (ii) the changes sought would not involvea material alteration to the requirements stated in the NRA. Changes thatwould affect a proposal's selection shall not be sought. When changes aredesired, they may be described to the contracting officer under subdivision(e)(10)(ii) of this section, or the selecting official may request revisionsfrom the offeror. The changes shall not transfer information from one offeror'sproposal to another offeror (see FAR 15.610(d)(2)). When collaborationbetween offerors would improve proposed research programs, collaborationmay be suggested to the offerors. (7) The basis for selection of a proposal shall be documented in a selectionstatement applying the evaluation factors in the NRA. The selection statementrepresents the conclusions of the selecting official and must be self-contained.It shall not incorporate by reference the evaluations of the reviewers.(8) A proposal that is scientifically and programmatically meritorious,but that is not selected during its initial review under an NRA, may beincluded in subsequent reviews unless the offeror requests otherwise. Ifthe proposal is not to be held over for subsequent reviews, the offerorshall be notified that the proposal was not selected for award. (9) The selecting official shall notify each offeror whose proposal wasnot selected for award and explain generally why the proposal was not selected.If requested, the selecting official shall arrange a debriefing under 1815.1003,with the participation of a contracting officer. (10) The selecting official shall forward to the contracting officer_ (i) The results of the technical evaluation, including the total numberof proposals received under the NRA by the time of selection, the selectionstatement, and the proposal(s) selected for funding;  (ii) A description of any changes desired in any offeror's statement ofwork, including the reasons for the changes and any effect on level offunding;  (iii) If a contract will be used to fund the proposal, a description ofdeliverables, including technical reports, and delivery dates, consistentwith the requirements of the NRA;  (iv) A procurement request;  (v) Comments on the offeror's cost proposal (either the selecting official'scomments, which may be based on the reviewers' comments, or copies of thereviewers' comments with any different conclusions of the selecting official);these comments shall address the need for and reasonableness of travel,computer time, materials, equipment, subcontracted items, publication costs,labor hours, labor mix, and other costs; and  (vi) A copy of the selected proposal as originally submitted, any revisions,and any related correspondence from the successful offeror. (11) The selecting official may provide to the contracting officer copiesof the reviewers' evaluations. Reviewers' names and institutions may beomitted in order to protect their identity. (12) The selecting official may notify each offeror whose proposal wasselected for negotiation leading to award.  (i) The notification shall state that_ (A) The proposal has been selected for negotiation leading to award;  (B) The offeror's business office will be contacted by a contracting officer,who is the only official authorized to obligate the Government; and  (C) Any expenses incurred by the offeror in anticipation of receiving anaward will be at the offeror's risk.  (ii) The notification may identify which award instrument (contract, grant,cooperative agreement, or other agreement) has been recommended. (f) <T3>Award.</T3> If a contract is selected as the award instrument (seeFAR 35.003(a) and 1835.003(a)), the contracting officer shall_(1) Advise the offeror that the Government contemplates entering into negotiations;the type of contract contemplated; and the estimated award date, levelof effort, and delivery schedule; (2) Send the offeror a model contract, if necessary, including modificationscontemplated in the offeror's statement of work, and request agreementor identification of any exceptions (the contract statement of work maysummarize the proposed research, state that the research shall be conductedin accordance with certain technical sections of the proposal (which shallbe identified by incorporating them into the contract by reference), andidentify any changes to the proposed research); (3) Request the offeror to complete and return certifications and representationsand Standard Form 33, Solicitation, Offer, and Award, or other appropriateforms; (4) Conduct negotiations in accordance with FAR Subparts 15.8 and 15.9,as applicable; (5) Award a contract with reasonable promptness to the successful offerorby transmitting written notice of the award to that offeror; and (6) Comply with FAR Subparts 4.6 and 5.3 on contract reporting and synopsesof contract awards, to the extent required by those subparts.

(c) The NASA policy of obtaining competition to the maximum practicableextent applies to these types of services.

Such firms shall be permittedto submit offers, provided they can substantiate their capability to establisha facility in a location that complies with any required geographical limitation.(d) A preferred method of obtaining services or supplies required on aprompt response basis is by clearly describing in the solicitation themaximum time that may elapse between placement of the order or call andthe delivery date. Such time limitations, when required by the nature ofthe procurement, will normally meet NASA's needs for prompt delivery withoutintroducing unnecessarily restrictive criteria limiting the competitivefield of prospective contractors.

This review shallbe coordinated with appropriate installation activities, including programmanagers, to ensure that all essential requirements are incorporated inthe delegation. A similar review shall be made before amending lettersof delegation under subparagraph (a)(6) of this section. (2) A planning conference shall be held with representatives of the contractadministration office when_ (i) A contract is expected to exceed $5,000,000;  (ii) Contract performance is required at or near another NASA installationor NASA-controlled launch site;  (iii) The delegation will impose an abnormal demand on the resources ofthe contract administration office receiving the delegation;  (iv) Complex contract management problems are expected; or  (v) The NASA contracting officer considers it advisable. (3) Contracting offices shall prepare, within 15 days after contract award,NASA Form 1430, Letter of Contract Administration Delegation, General,for the delegation, redelegating, and amending of contract administrationfunctions. NASA Form 1430A, Letter of Contract Administration Delegation,Special Instructions, shall be used to supplement NASA Form 1430 to_ (i) Delegate any optional functions listed in 1842.202 (a)(2) or (c)(2); (ii) Modify previously delegated functions;  (iii) Retain the administration of functions other than those listed inFAR 42.302(a); or  (iv) Provide additional or peculiar information concerning the contractthat may assist the contract administration office to perform the delegatedcontract administration responsibilities more effectively (but see subparagraph(a)(4) of this section). (4) Letters of delegation and special instructions shall not include anyclauses or other requirements that are or should be contained in the contractand shall not_ (i) Cite administrative procedures or repeat the functions covered in FAR42.302(a) or other information covered in DOD issuances;  (ii) Place restrictions on administrative contracting officers; or  (iii) Include references to NASA issuances, unless specific written NASA/DODagreements exist that include references to these issuances, or unlessthe NASA issuances are a requirement of the contract. When it is appropriateto cite DOD issuances in a letter of delegation, the NASA contracting officershall ensure that they are applicable to the contract administration officeconcerned (e.g., that Air Force issuances are not cited in delegationsto Navy or DCAS contract administration offices). (5) Delegations and amendments to them should be accompanied by documentationand supporting information that will ensure a complete understanding ofthe contract administration services to be performed. Contract administrationoffices shall be kept fully informed of any actions that may affect theperformance of the delegated functions. Copies of all significant documentsshould be furnished to the contract administration office throughout theperiod of performance. Significant documents include, but are not limitedto_(i) All contractual documents such as the contract and any specificationsand drawings, change orders, supplemental agreements or contractor proposalsreferenced in the contract;(ii) Negotiation memoranda covering negotiations of contracts or contractchanges in excess of $100,000;(iii) Copies of any delegation and amendments it sent to other contractadministration offices that have a bearing on the contract, including thoseissued pursuant to 1842.102-70; and(iv) Any other correspondence affecting contract performance under thecontract.(6)(i) The contracting officer shall issue amendments to letters of delegationwhen amendments to the contract are of a nature that will change the scopeof functions previously delegated, when additional functions are requiredto be delegated, or when previously delegated functions are to be terminatedin whole or part. However, when a contract administration office has retiredthe original letter of delegation with the records of a physically completedbut administratively open contract, a new letter of delegation shall beissued to support any additional reimbursable services required under thedelegation.(ii) In order to minimize the need for a duplicate delegation at a laterdate on a contract that is nearing closeout, the NASA contracting officershall advise the contract administration office to hold the contract inopen status when conditions exist or are expected that would justify extensionof the contract period of performance. Appropriate NASA forms listed inPart 1853 shall be used in the amendment process. The forms shall be clearlyannotated as amendments to the original delegation.(7) NASA Form 1431, Letter of Acceptance of Contract Administration Delegation,shall be forwarded with each NASA Form 1430 or amendment. The NASA contractingofficer shall use the returned form as evidence that the delegation hasbeen received and accepted by the contract administration office and asa reference for points of contact for each of the functional areas delegated.(8) Delegations shall be sent to DOD contract administration offices inaccordance with the instructions in the DOD Directory of Contract AdministrationServices Components (DOD 4105.59H).(9) The contracting officer shall distribute copies of the contract andletters of delegation for contract administration (including amendmentsas follows):(i) To DCAS and all other Government contract administration offices exceptDOD military contract administration offices, when two or more functionalareas are delegated: Five copies of the contract and NASA Form 1430 andthree NASA Forms 1431.(ii) To DOD military component offices when two or more functional areasare delegated: Three copies of the contract and three NASA Forms 1430 and1431.(iii) To any contract administration office when a single functional areais delegated: Two copies of the contract and two NASA Forms 1430 and 1431.(iv) To the contractor: One NASA Form 1430.(b) <T3>Reliability and quality assurance.</T3> When special instructions forreliability or quality assurance are necessary, they shall be (1) clearlyidentified by the NASA installation personnel responsible for the reliabilityand quality assurance function and (2) furnished to the contracting officeron NASA Form 1430A for inclusion in the letter of delegation. The proceduresfor arranging, preparing, and finalizing such delegations and the requirementsfor NASA direction and management of these functions are contained in installationprocedures. The latest edition of NHB 5300.4(2B), Quality Assurance Provisionsfor Delegated Government Agencies, describes the requirements for performingquality assurance functions under NASA contracts.(c) <T3>Transportation and packaging.</T3> Transportation and packaging functionsmay be delegated at the option of the NASA installation personnel responsiblefor the transportation and packaging function. When such delegations arecontemplated on a particular contract, special instructions shall be furnishedto the NASA contracting officer on NASA Form 1430A. The form shall also:(1) Specify the limit of the value of Government bills of lading that maybe issued without further consent of the NASA contracting officer and(2) Provide appropriate funding information.(d) <T3>Property administration and plant clearance.</T3> Property administrationand plant clearance are ordinarily delegated by NASA to DOD pursuant toFAR 42.302. When these functions are delegated, special instructions preparedand distributed by the Headquarters Supply and Equipment Management Branch,Code NIE, should be issued to the contract administration office. Propertyadministration and plant clearance are typically retained, however, andperformed by NASA when the contract work is to be performed at a NASA installation.When retained, the functions should be performed in accordance with Subpart1845.72.(e) <T3>Services not requiring letters of delegation.</T3> (1) When it is desiredthat a contract administration or audit office perform services that precedethe award of a contract, such as cost, price, or technical evaluations(but exclusive of pre-award surveys), NASA Form 1434, Letter of Requestfor Pricing-Audit-Technical Evaluation Services, shall be used. Pre-awardsurveys shall be requested on SF 1403, Pre-award Survey of ProspectiveContractor (General). Oral requests made to contract administration officesto expedite these services are authorized, but shall be confirmed in writingimmediately through the use of NASA Form 1434 or SF 1403, as appropriate.(2) Pre-award and post-award services, such as verification of labor andoverhead rates, and furnishing of similar information readily availablewithin contract administration and audit offices and not normally subjectto reimbursement by NASA, may be obtained either orally without writtenconfirmation or through the use of NASA Form 1434, as appropriate.<ITAG tagnum="80">1842.202-71</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Delegations to audit offices.</ITAG>The following procedures apply when delegations are made to audit offices:(a) NASA installations shall utilize the services of other Government auditorganizations for performance of contract cost audit and other audit functions,except when audits will be performed by NASA auditors. The Defense ContractAudit Agency (DCAA) has been designated as the DOD agency responsible forthe performance of audit functions for NASA contracts, except those awardedto educational institutions for which other agencies have audit cognizanceunder OMB Circular No. 88, those with Canadian contractors (see paragraph(d) of this section), and those for which NASA will perform audits. Toensure that audit services are performed expeditiously, audit delegationsshall be sent to the appropriate audit office immediately after executionof all cost-reimbursement, labor-hour, and time-and-materials contractsand all fixed-price contracts containing cost-reimbursement or price adjustmentclauses. Audit functions include but are not limited to contract cost andprice audits, estimating systems surveys, reviews of accounting systems(see also 1815.871(b)), and approval of vouchers for provisional payment.(b)(1) Delegations shall be sent to cognizant audit offices as listed inthe Defense Contract Audit Agency Directory (Headquarters and Field Offices)or in other Government agency directories.(2) Audit responsibilities for the Department of Health and Human Services(HHS) do not include reviewing and processing vouchers. Consequently, whereaudit responsibility has been delegated to HHS under OMB Circular No. A-88,contracts shall not designate HHS as the billing office for invoice submission.Instead, contracts should direct invoices to the office administering thecontract or as otherwise arranged (see SF 26, Block 10, and SF 33, Block23).(c)(1) NASA Form 1433, Letter of Audit Delegation, shall be used to delegatethe audit function and to amend previous delegations. Distribute copiesof the contract and NASA Form 1433 as follows: (i) Audit office: One copy of the contract and three NASA Forms 1433. (ii) Contractor: One NASA Form 1433. (iii) Cognizant NASA fiscal or financial management office: One NASA Form1433. (2) When HHS is designated as the audit office, item 12 on NASA Form 1433shall be marked ``Not applicable.'' (d)(1) For contracts with the Canadian Commercial Corporation (CCC), auditsare automatically arranged by the Department of Defense Production (Canada)(DDP) in accordance with agreements between NASA and DDP. Audit reportsare furnished to DDP. Upon advice from DDP, CCC will certify the invoiceand forward it with Standard Form 1034, Public Voucher, to the contractingofficer for further processing and transmittal to the fiscal or financialmanagement officer. (2) For contracts placed directly with Canadian firms, audits are requestedby the contracting officer from the Audit Services Branch, Comptrollerof the Treasury, Department of Finance, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. Invoicesare approved by the auditor on a provisional basis pending completion ofthe contract and final audit. These invoices, accompanied by SF 1034, areforwarded to the contracting officer for further processing and transmittalto the fiscal or financial management officer. Periodic advisory auditreports are furnished directly to the contracting officer. (3) Audits performed by the Audit Services Branch are normally conductedunder DDP regulations. <ITAG tagnum="80">1842.202-72 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Delegations to security offices. </ITAG>NASA's policies and procedures on security are set forth in NMI 1650.1,Industrial Security Policies and Procedures.

(A ``carve-out'' is defined in Section 1, paragraph 3,item f.1., of the DOD Industrial Security Manual for Safeguarding ClassifiedInformation, September 1987, DOD 5220.22M, as a classified contract issuedin connection with an approved Special Access Program in which the DefenseInvestigative Service has been relieved of inspection responsibility inwhole or in part.) The basis for DOD's performance of administrative contractingofficer responsibility for the Industrial Security Program on NASA contractsis a NASA-DOD Agreement.

If necessary, the contracting officer may designatean alternate COTR to act during short absences of the COTR; the policiesand procedures for COTRs shall apply also to alternate COTRs. Technicalorganizations are responsible for ensuring that the individual they recommendto the contracting officer possesses qualifications and experience commensuratewith the authorities to be delegated and the nature of the contract. Thecontracting officer shall ensure that the duties and responsibilities delegateddo not exceed the limitations at 1801.670(b). (b) COTRs shall be designated by name and position title (see the 1801.670(b)prohibition against delegating COTR duties solely to a position ratherthan to a named individual). Each COTR designation shall be in writingand shall clearly define the scope and limitations of the COTR's authority.NASA Form 1634, Contracting Officer Technical Representative (COTR) Delegation,shall be used to designate COTRs. The COTR delegation shall be signed byan appropriate contracting officer (see 1801.670(b)) and shall state thatthe duties delegated are not redelegable and that the COTR may be personallyliable for unauthorized direction. (However, this does not prohibit theCOTR from having assistants for the purpose of monitoring contractor progressand gathering information.) When an individual is to act for a contractingofficer on more than one contract, separate delegations shall be issuedfor each contract. A separate NASA Form 1634 may be modified as necessaryto designate an alternate COTR; alternates may act only during officialabsences of the COTR such as leave, TDY, or other special assignments.The delegated duties of the alternate may not exceed those of the COTR.(c) A COTR delegation remains in effect throughout the life of the contractunless cancelled in writing by an appropriate contracting officer. Thecontracting officer may modify the scope and limitations of a COTR assignmentonly by cancelling the delegation and issuing a new delegation.  (d) A COTR may not be authorized to initiate procurement actions by useof purchase orders or to place calls or delivery orders under indefinite-deliverycontracts or basic ordering agreements. A COTR may not be authorized toaward, agree to, or sign any contract or modification or in any way obligatethe payment of money by the Government. The COTR is not authorized to issuetechnical direction unless the clause at 1852.242-70, Technical Direction,prescribed in 1842.7001, is included in the contract and the authorizationis specifically listed in paragraph 3(m) of the COTR delegation letter(NASA Form 1634). However, delegations may be made to construction contractCOTRs to sign emergency change orders with an estimated value not to exceed$2,500, onsite at construction sites, if sufficient funds have been certifiedto cover the emergency change. (e) The contracting officer shall send the original and one copy of theCOTR delegation letter to the COTR, who shall be required to acknowledgereceipt by signing the original and returning it to the contracting officer.The original of the COTR delegation letter shall be filed and retainedin the applicable contract file. Copies of the COTR delegation letter shallbe distributed to the contractor and to each cognizant contract administrationoffice.

In accordance withany instructions received from the contracting officer, the contract auditorshall promptly examine and approve (but see paragraph (b) of this section)separate fee vouchers and fee portions of vouchers for provisional paymentunder the contract. After examination, the auditor shall forward completionvouchers to the contracting officer for approval and transmittal to thecognizant fiscal or financial management officer.(b) When audit functions are delegated, special instructions may be issuedto the contract auditor to_(1) Require submission of separate vouchers for reimbursable costs andfor payment of earned fee; and/or(2) Reserve to the contracting officer approval of separate fee vouchersand all vouchers submitted by contractors performing at a NASA installation.(c) Unless otherwise notified, the contractor shall be required to submitpublic vouchers to the auditor as follows:(1) One original SF 1034, SF 1035, or equivalent contractor's attachmentshall be submitted. (2) Seven copies of SF 1034A, SF 1035A, or equivalent contractor's attachmentshall be submitted. (3) The contractor shall mark SF 1034A copies 1, 2, 3, 4, and such othercopies as may be directed by the contracting officer by inserting in thememorandum block names and addresses as follows:  (i) Copy 1, NASA contracting officer.  (ii) Copy 2, Defense Contract Audit Agency auditor.  (iii) Copy 3, Contractor.  (iv) Copy 4, Contract administration office.  (v) Copy 5, Project management office (when required by the NASA contractingofficer). (4) The auditor shall retain an unpaid copy of the voucher. (5) When a voucher contains one or more individual direct freight chargesof $100 or more, an additional copy of SF 1034A and SF 1035A shall be submittedand marked for return to the contractor after payment. This copy shallbe transmitted quarterly by the contractor with the freight bills to theGeneral Services Administration. When a voucher is identified as the ``CompletionVoucher,'' an additional copy shall be submitted for transmittal to theNASA contracting officer. (d) Following a prompt and careful review of the facts and circumstancesleading the auditor to initiate the NASA Form 456, and after coordinationwith other NASA and DOD contracting officers administering contracts withthe same contractor under which a NASA Form 456, or a DCAA Form 1 in thecase of a DOD contract, has been issued for the same items of cost, thecontracting officer shall take one of the following actions: (1) Countersign the NASA Form 456 disapproving the costs. (2) Countersign the NASA Form 456 suspending the costs. (3) Issue a new NASA Form 456 suspending the costs rather than disapprovingthem pending resolution of the issues. (4) Have the contractor issue a new voucher removing the costs in questionfrom its claim and return the NASA Form 456 to the auditor unsigned. (5) Return the unsigned NASA Form 456 to the auditor with a detailed explanationof why the suspension or disapproval is not being countersigned, and processthe contractor's claim for payment. (e) The contracting officer, when in agreement with the NASA Form 456 initiatedby the auditor, shall assign a notice number and shall countersign theform. An original and three copies (which includes two acknowledgementcopies, one each for return to the contracting officer and the auditor)of the form shall be sent to the contractor by certified mail, return receiptrequested; one copy shall be attached to the SF 1034 and each copy of theSF 1034A (see paragraph (c) of this section) on which the deduction ismade, and one copy shall be sent to the auditor. (f) The total amount suspended or disapproved, as shown on the NASA Form456, shall be inserted in the Differences block of the SF 1034 and SF 1034A,citing the applicable NASA Form 456. (g)(1) If the amount of the deduction is more than the amount of the publicvoucher, the installment method of deduction shall be applied to this andsubsequent public vouchers until the amount is fully liquidated. The deductionson any voucher may not exceed the voucher amount, to avoid processing ofa voucher in a credit amount. Public voucher(s) with zero amounts mustbe forwarded to the fiscal or financial management office for appropriateaction. (2) If deductions are in excess of contractor claims, recovery may be madethrough a direct refund from the contractor, in the form of a check payableto NASA, or by a set-off deduction from the voucher(s) submitted by thecontractor under any other contract, unless those contracts contain a ``noset-off'' provision. If a set-off is effected, the voucher(s) from whichthe deduction is made should be annotated to identify the contract andappropriation affected and the applicable NASA Form 456.

(b) If it is desirable to preclude a large number of small-dollar, contractor-initiatedengineering changes and to reduce the administrative cost of reviewingthem, the contracting officer shall use the clause with its Alternate I.(c) If the contract is a cost-reimbursement contract, the contracting officershall use the clause with its Alternate II. <ITAG tagnum="80">1843.270 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Originating engineering change proposals. </ITAG>Either party to the contract may originate engineering changes.

Contract modificationsshould include only fund citations (i.e., accounting and appropriationsdata) applicable to the particular modification. The cumulative inception-to-datelisting of funding citations for previous modifications is discouragedunless there is a contractual need requiring such a listing. Modificationsshould include, as a minimum, the prior total funding, the change takingplace, and a new total value. (b) When an internal administrative change of funding citations relativeto a contract is required, the official determining the need for the changeshall request it, obtain applicable installation approvals, and then forwarddocumentation to the financial management officer and the contracting officerto facilitate it. An administrative modification of the contract is notrequired unless it affects the billing or reporting requirements placedupon the contractor. (c) These procedures do not reduce the contracting officer's responsibilityfor ensuring that obligations are made only on the basis of appropriatedfunds. <ITAG tagnum="52">PART 1844_SUBCONTRACTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="72">Subpart 1844.1_General</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="70">Sec.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1844.102 Policy.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1844.102-70 Special contracting officer consent requirements for criticalsubcontracts.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1844.102-71 Headquarters review of critical subcontracts.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1844.102-72 New sources of scientific and technical competence.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1844.170 NASA contract clause.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="72">Subpart 1844.3_Contractors' Purchasing Systems Reviews</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1844.302 Requirements.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1844.302-70 Contractors' purchasing systems reviews conducted by theDepartment of Defense.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1844.302-71 NASA-conducted contractors' purchasing systems reviews.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority:</T4> 42 U.S.C. 2473(c)(1).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="52">Subpart 1844.1_General</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="80">1844.102</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Policy.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="80">1844.102-70</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Special contracting officer consent requirements for critical subcontracts.</ITAG>If the contracting officer (in conjunction with the technical representative,when appropriate) determines that a proposed subcontract may be criticalbecause of special considerations in the source selection or in the incentivearrangements, or for other reasons, a requirement shall be included inthe Schedule of the prime contract (if not already provided for in thestandard subcontracts clause) for the contracting officer to be notifiedof and consent to the critical subcontract before its award by the contractor.<ITAG tagnum="80">1844.102-71</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Headquarters review of critical subcontracts.</ITAG>(a) If a requirement is established by the Headquarters source selectionofficial or the Assistant Administrator for Procurement for a Headquartersreview of a critical subcontract prior to its award, the contracting officershall_(1) Require consent as specified in 1844.102-70; and(2) Before consenting to the subcontract, submit to the Assistant Administratorfor Procurement (Code HS) for review_(i) The subcontract;(ii) Contractor documentation in support of the subcontract (includingthat required by the notification provisions of the subcontracts clause);and(iii) The contracting officer's review and evaluation (in accordance withFAR 44.202), with appropriate recommendations.(b) Consent shall not be granted by the contracting officer until notification(with limitations and objections, if any) is received from the AssistantAdministrator for Procurement.<ITAG tagnum="80">1844.102-72</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">New sources of scientific and technical competence.</ITAG>As a Government agency whose mission involves substantial Federal expendituresand use of national resources, NASA has a strong interest in helping accomplishcollateral national economic goals within the framework of applicable statutoryand administrative authority in a way that will not impair program effectiveness.Utilization in the space program and the accompanying development of thepotential of all geographical regions will effectively contribute to achievingnational goals.

contractors shall ordinarilyfurnish all property is that providing Government property (whether Government-furnishedor contractor-acquired) increases the Government's administrative burdenand requires recordkeeping and personnel. Providing property may dilutethe contractor's overall responsibility and weaken guarantees, end-itemdelivery requirements, and other contract terms. Furnishing property placesNASA between the source of the property and the contractor. When NASA assumesresponsibility for scheduling delivery of the property, NASA may be responsiblefor delays. (b) Nevertheless, sometimes providing Government property to contractorsmay be essential to contract performance or otherwise advantageous to NASA.For example, furnishing standardized production property and raw materialsmay be necessary for uniformity of products. Furnishing Government propertycan reduce the production cycle by eliminating the lead time necessaryfor the contractor to acquire or fabricate production property. NASA maybe able to broaden its competitive base by offering property to firms unableto acquire their own, or by offering production property or critical materialnot generally available throughout the industry. NASA may lower contractcosts by offering existing Government property or new Government propertyobtainable at prices lower than those available to the contractor. NASAmay also provide Government property to educational or other nonprofitinstitutions to facilitate scientific research. <ITAG tagnum="80">1845.102-70 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Procedures. </ITAG>The contracting officer shall, as applicable, include in each solicitationa_(a) List of any Government property (showing location and condition), includingGovernment-owned tooling, that will be furnished for the performance ofthe contract and any related special provisions; (b) Requirement that information be furnished regarding:(1) Any Government-owned facilities or items of industrial equipment orspecial tooling requested to be used in performing the contract,(2) Their acquisition cost,(3) Identification of the Government contract under which the propertyis accountable,(4) Rental provisions, and(5) Other relevant matters;(c) Requirement that additional facilities that the offeror requests tobe provided by the Government be described and identified by category,such as ``Land,'' ``Buildings,'' and ``Equipment'' (see Subpart 1845.71);and(d) Requirement that additional special test equipment that the offerorrequests to be provided by the Government be described and its intendeduse, estimated cost, and proposed location be shown.<ITAG tagnum="80">1845.104</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Review and correction of contractors' property control systems.</ITAG>(a) When review of the contractor's property control system is not delegatedto DOD, the NASA contracting officer or property administrator shall conductthe review as required in Subpart 1845.72.(b) In each solicitation under which use of Government property is contemplated,the contracting officer shall require the offeror to_(1) Furnish the date of the last Government review of its property controland accounting system and describe actions taken to correct any deficienciesfound;(2) State that the offeror has reviewed, understands, and can comply withall property management and accounting procedures in the solicitation,FAR Subpart 45.5, and Subparts 1845.5, 1845.70, and 1845.71 of this Regulation;and(3) State whether the costs associated with subparagraph (b)(2) of thissection are included in its cost proposal.<ITAG tagnum="80">1845.104-70</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Contract property administration by the Government.</ITAG>DOD will conduct contract property administration in accordance with theirregulations and procedures and NASA special delegation instructions.

See 1845.7103 and the clause at 1852.245-70for instructions on preparing DD Form 1419.(b)(1) The contracting officer shall insert the clause at 1852.245-71,Installation-Provided Government Property, in solicitations and contractswhen Government property is to be provided to on-site contractors, andthe Government will retain accountability for the property. The contractingofficer shall identify in the Contract Schedule the nature and extent ofsuch property and the installation supply and equipment management officerwill make such property available to the contractor on a no-charge-for-usebasis. The contracting officer shall also list in the contract the applicableinstallation property management directives.(2) Contracting officers may also use the clause if Government propertyis provided to off-site local support service contractors. In this case,the concurrence of the installation supply and equipment management officermust be obtained and indicated in the procurement request. (3) To avoid diluting contractor responsibilities when they include separateprocurement authority and responsibility, contracting officers may precludesuch contractors from utilizing the installation's central receiving facilityfor receiving contractor-acquired property. To accomplish this, the contractingofficer shall use the clause with its Alternate I. The contracting officershall review the acquisitions reported by the contractor for their appropriateness,and the supply and equipment management officer shall ensure that recordsare established. (4) Contracting officers shall clearly identify in a separate scheduleany property provided under a Government property clause but not also subjectto the clause at 1852.245-71. The contracting officer shall address anyspecific maintenance considerations (for example, requiring use of a centralcalibration facility) elsewhere in the contract.

If (1) a substantial quantity of parts or material willbe furnished, (2) a significant amount of scrap will result from the workto be performed, or (3) other Government property will be furnished toor acquired by the contractor, the contract will also contain the appropriateGovernment property clause (see FAR 45.106) and the contract Schedule shallprovide that such property shall be governed by the terms of that clause.When minor repairs are obtained under small purchase procedures, the proceduresof this paragraph (c) shall not apply. Contracting officers shall not requireadditional insurance under the clause at 1852.245-72 unless the circumstancesclearly indicate advantages to the Government. (d) The contracting officer shall insert the clause at 1852.245-73, FinancialReporting of Government-Owned/Contractor-Held Property, in all contractsunless (1) it is virtually certain that Government property will not befurnished to or acquired by the contractor (e.g., as in most study contractsand certain contracts for services), (2) the only property to be providedis for the purpose of repair or servicing (see 1852.245-72), or (3) allproperty to be provided is subject to the clause at 1852.245-71, Installation-ProvidedGovernment Property (see paragraph (b) above). Reporting shall be on anannual basis except when an on-site contractor performs property acquisitionand management for the Government.

It includesthe cost of personal property unique to NASA aeronautical and space programsand not otherwise included in the classifications of property set forthin paragraphs (a) through (h) of this section. Space hardware is dividedas follows for financial reporting purposes: (1) Completed space hardware, systems, and subsystems (includes the cost,actual or estimated, of such items as aircraft, engines, space vehicles,satellites, spacecraft, and rockets, including components provided forprototypes, mock-ups, or fit checks, or for such other reasons as may bespecified in the contract). (2) Spare parts and components (includes the cost, actual or estimated,of deliverable spare parts and components employed as spare parts to beused for the purpose of emergency replacement, repair, or modificationafter the fabrication of space hardware). These types of property are commonlyreferred to as ``logistics spares'' or ``test support spares'' and do notinclude components utilized by the contractor that are not deliverableas spares and that are included as work in process. (3) Space hardware work in process (includes the actual or estimated fabricationcosts as of the date of the report of undelivered space hardware and associatedsystems, subsystems, spare parts, and components provided or acquired andcharged to work in process pending incorporation into an end item). Suchitems are included in what is sometimes called production inventory andinclude programmed extra units to cover replacement during the fabricationprocess (production spares). Also included are progress payments to firm-fixed-pricesubcontractors for undelivered items. <ITAG tagnum="80">1845.7101-2 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Transfers of property. </ITAG>So that NASA may properly control and account for contractor-held Governmentproperty (both Government-furnished and contractor-acquired), all transfersto another contract, contractor, NASA installation, or other Governmentagency shall be adequately documented. Such transfers shall be accomplishedonly through the NASA installation responsible for the contract from whichthe property is being transferred. (a) <T3>Transfers by contractors</T3>_(1) <T3>Approval and notification. </T3>The contractor must obtain the contractingofficer's or designee's approval for transfers of property before shipment.Shipping documents shall specify the appropriate property classification,such as plant equipment, special test equipment, special tooling, or spacehardware. Shipping contractors shall notify the cognizant property administratorof transfers of property by furnishing a copy of the shipping document.Shipping and receiving contractors shall promptly notify their respectiveNASA financial management offices when accountability for Government propertyreportable on NASA Form 1018 is transferred to, or received from, othercontracts, contractors, NASA installations, or Government agencies. Copiesof shipping/receiving documents will suffice in most instances. (2) <T3>Documentation. </T3>The shipping contractor shall prepare an acceptableform of documentation such as DD Form 250, Material Inspection and ReceivingReport; DD Form 1149, Requisition and Invoice/Shipping Document; or similarforms to cover movement of Government property to other Government agencies.Established procedures for the use of such forms shall be strictly followed.Each shipping document must contain contract numbers, shipping references,property classifications in which the items are recorded, unit prices,and any other appropriate identifying or descriptive data. Unit pricesshall be obtained from records maintained pursuant to the provisions ofFAR Part 45 and Part 1845 of this regulation. (3) <T3>Reporting. </T3>In addition to the required shipping documentation,all transfers of reportable property occurring during the reporting periodshall be reflected in column (b), Government-Furnished Additions, of NASAForm 1018 by the receiving contractor and in column (e), Disposals, ofNASA Form 1018 by the shipping contractor. (4) <T3>Reclassification. </T3>Reclassifications between property accountsshall be accomplished by the contractor holding the property at the timereclassification takes place. If property is transferred to another contractor contractor, the receiving contractor shall record it in the same propertyclassification and amount appearing on the shipping document. (For example,when a contractor receives an item, by transfer from another contractoror NASA installation, that is identified on the shipping document as plantequipment but that the recipient intends to incorporate into special testequipment, the recipient shall first enter the item in the plant equipmentaccount and subsequently reclassify it as special test equipment.) Thereclassification of plant equipment, special tooling, special test equipment,or space hardware requires prior notification to the property administratorand approval of the contracting officer. (5) <T3>Incomplete documentation. </T3>If contractors receive transfer documentshaving insufficient detail to properly record the transfer (e.g., omissionof property classification, unit prices, etc.), they shall request theomitted data directly from the shipping contractor or through the propertyadministrator as provided in FAR 45.505-2. Contractors may append a Government-furnishedproperty list to the NASA Form 1018 report when unable to obtain the requireddata, provided that the list includes_ (i) A description of the property;  (ii) Quantity;  (iii) The shipping document reference;  (iv) The shipper's identity;  (v) The dates shipped or received;  (vi) The dates price data were requested and from whom (shipper or propertyadministrator); and  (vii) The NASA Form 1018 line item (type/account) to be adjusted. (b) <T3>Other transfers</T3>_(1) <T3>Intracontractor transfers. </T3>Any transfer of Government propertybetween contracts of a single contractor, whether administered by the sameNASA installation or by different NASA installations, requires the sameapproval, notification, and documentation set forth in paragraph (a) ofthis section.(2) Transfer to Government agencies other than NASA. Transfers of Governmentproperty to other Government agencies can be accomplished only throughthe NASA contracting officer and require the same approval, notification,and documentation set forth in paragraph (a) of this section.(3) Recovered space hardware. Space hardware recovered after flight andtransferred to a contractor for analysis, repair, refurbishment, or otherpurposes shall not be reported on subsequent NASA Forms 1018 as space hardwareunless accountability has been transferred and the contractor is specificallydirected to report the item. <ITAG tagnum="80">1845.7101-3</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Submission of reports.</ITAG>(a) When the contract includes the Financial Reporting of Government-Owned/Contractor-HeldProperty clause, the contractor shall prepare a Report of Government-Owned/Contractor-HeldProperty, NASA Form 1018, in accordance with these instructions and thoseon the NASA Form 1018.(b) The contractor shall submit four copies of NASA Form 1018 for the periodending June 30 in accordance with the clause not later than July 31 ofeach year, when reporting is required annually.

It provides guidance to NASA installation personnel responsiblefor NASA contract property (NASA personal property in the possession ofcontractors). It applies to all NASA installation personnel charged withthis responsibility, including industrial property officers and specialists,property administrators, and plant clearance officers. It also providesdetailed procedures for property administration. The NASA Contract PropertyManagement Program includes the following three major elements:(a) Performance of property administration and plant clearance by DOD underdelegations from NASA, pursuant to 1842.101.(b) Performance of property administration and plant clearance by NASAunder certain situations, pursuant to 1842.203.(c) Maintenance of property administration and plant clearance functionaloversight, regardless of delegations, pursuant to 1842.175.<ITAG tagnum="80">1845.7203</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Delegations of property administration and plant clearance.</ITAG>When delegated to DOD, property administration and plant clearance areperformed in accordance with DOD's regulations and procedures, as amendedby the NASA Letter of Contract Administration Delegation, Special Instructionson Property Administration and Plant Clearance. These Special Instructionsare developed by NASA Headquarters, Supply and Equipment Management Division,Code NIE, and are available from that office upon request. The contractingofficer shall issue the Special Instructions with delegations wheneverGovernment property will be involved. Additional or more tailored propertyinstructions are not proscribed but must be coordinated with Code NIE beforeissuance.<ITAG tagnum="80">1845.7204</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Retention of property administration and plant clearance.</ITAG>NASA may occasionally retain the property administration and plant clearancefunction, such as for contract work performed at the installation awardingthe contract and not subject to the clause at 1852.245-71, Installation-ProvidedGovernment Property. In these cases, property administration shall be performedin accordance with Subparts 1845.2 through 1845.7, and plant clearanceshall be performed in accordance with FAR Subpart 45.6 and Subpart 1845.6.Under the clause at 1852.245-71, property administration and plant clearanceare neither delegated nor retained; they are simply not required becausethe property is treated as installation rather than contract property.<ITAG tagnum="80">1845.7205</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Functional oversight of property administration and plant clearance.</ITAG>NASA contracting officers retain functional management responsibility fortheir contracts. Utilization of the contract administration services ofanother Government agency in no way relieves NASA contracting officersof their ultimate responsibility for the proper and effective managementof contracts. The functional management responsibility for contract propertyis outlined below. Beyond individual contracting officers, each NASA installationhas designated an industrial property officer to manage and coordinateproperty matters among the various contracting officers, technical officials,contractor officials, and delegated property administrators and plant clearanceofficers. Generally, that individual is responsible for the entire contractproperty management function outlined below; the installation is responsiblefor the entire function regardless of how it is organized and distributed.The responsibilities are as follows:(a) Provide a focal point for all management of contract property, includingGovernment property (Government-furnished and contractor-acquired) providedto universities as well as to industry.(b) Provide guidance to contracting and other personnel on the NASA propertyprovisions.(c) To the extent feasible, review property provisions of procurement plans,solicitations, contracts, and modifications for potential problems. Proposechanges as necessary.(d) To the extent feasible, participate in pre-award surveys/post-awardorientations when significant amounts of Government property will be involved.(e) Ensure that vesting-of-title determinations are made and documentedpursuant to FAR 35.014(b). (f) Maintain effective communications with delegated property administratorsand plant clearance officers to keep fully informed about contractor performanceand progress on any property control problems. (1) Obtain and review property control system survey summaries for allcontracts for which property administration has been delegated. AdviseHeadquarters Code NIE of any severe or continuing problems. (2) Provide property administrators copies of all pertinent contract propertydocumentation. (g) Work with the NASA Equipment Management System (NEMS) Coordinator andcontracting officers to ensure contractor reporting to and screening ofNEMS. (1) Monitor contractors' performance in submitting DD Form 1419's or equivalentrequest format before acquiring centrally reportable equipment (CRE) andin submitting DD Form 1342's or equivalent report format after receivingCRE. (2) Ensure that an annual NEMS verification is performed in accordancewith 1845.505-670(c) and NHB 4200.1, paragraph 4.406b. (h) Review and analyze NASA Form 1018's, Reports of Government-Owned/Contractor-HeldProperty. (1) Ensure an annual comparison of 1018's with NEMS in accordance withNHB 4200.1, paragraph 4.406c, to detect possible over/under reporting toNEMS and possible failure to screen NEMS. (2) Check new disparities disclosed under subparagraph (1) above with theappropriate property administrator and document the results. (i) Negotiate, or ensure the negotiation of, facilities contracts whenrequired by FAR 45.302 and 1845.302. Advise Headquarters Code NIE annuallyof new and completed facilities contracts. (j) Review property administrators' approvals of relief of responsibilityfor lost, damaged, and destroyed property and question any excessive orrepetitive approvals. (k) When appropriate, make recommendations to source and performance evaluationboards regarding property management and award fee criteria and evaluationsregarding property management.(l) Monitor plant clearance status to preclude delays in contract closeout.(m) Maintain contract property files for all transactions and correspondenceassociated with each contract. Upon receipt of Standard Form 1424, InventoryDisposal Report, and DD Form 1593, Contract Administration Completion Record,or equivalents, merge all property records for the contract and forwardfor inclusion with the official completed file. (n) Perform on-site property administration and plant clearance when theyare not delegated to DOD and the property is not subject to the clauseat 1852.245-71.

When a conference isheld for this purpose, the property administrator shall ensure suitablediscussion of property administration requirements and responsibilities.When a conference is not held, the property administrator, upon assignmentof a contract, shall forward a letter to the contractor_(a) Inviting attention to the contractor's responsibilities regarding Governmentproperty under the contract, including any specialized controls, and theextent of the contractor's liability for loss, damage, or destruction ofGovernment property during any period in which the contractor's propertycontrol system does not have the written approval of the property administrator;(b) Requesting the name of the contractor's representatives to contactfor review and discussion of the proposed property control system; and(c) Requesting that policies, instructions, and procedures necessary forfully implementing the property control system be available for evaluation.<ITAG tagnum="80">1845.7208-2 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Review of procedures. </ITAG>(a) Following assignment of an initial contract, the property administratorshall review the contractor's proposed property control system proceduresto determine_(1) Inadequate or questionable areas in the proposed procedures for compliancewith NASA contract requirements; (2) Essential controls not provided by the proposed procedures; (3) Areas in the proposed procedures requiring physical observation orverification; and (4) Subcontractors, or secondary locations of prime contract performance,and the need for physical observation or verification of property controlsat those locations. (b) It is normal industry practice to provide for property control by meansof written procedures that communicate company standards, techniques, andinstructions to operational personnel for uniform application. However,a contractor with few employees may not need written procedures for effectivemanagement of Government property. In such cases, the property administratorshall evaluate the adequacy of the contractor's system on the basis ofthe contractor's explanation of its controls and observation of their application,and shall prepare a brief description of the procedures for inclusion inthe Contract Property Control Data File. In the latter instance, the contractor'ssignature shall be obtained signifying concurrence with the property administrator'swritten description. (c) The contractor's plant shall be visited to determine that the contractor'soperation of the system provides adequate controls for the Government propertyto be furnished or acquired. (d) The means of obtaining the information necessary for approving thecontractor's property control system is a matter for the property administrator'sjudgment. Test examinations and verification in specific categories maybe necessary to ensure the reliability of the final evaluation and permitconclusions as to the acceptability of controls for all categories andthe system as a whole. (e) The property administrator shall examine the contractor's proceduresto determine whether they meet the contractual requirements for propertycontrol. The property administrator shall test and analyze the contractor'ssystem, noting or commenting on the acceptability of the procedures inpreparing the record of system evaluation (see 1845.7208-4). (f) If the contractor's property control system has previously been approvedand a new contract requires the expansion of existing or the establishmentof additional controls, the property administrator should normally limitthe review to the new requirements. If the system is adequate, the propertyadministrator shall record this fact on the Property Summary Data Recordfor the contract. Notification to the contractor is not required. However,if the property administrator determines that the contractor's propertycontrol system does not adequately meet the new contract requirements,the property administrator shall annotate the Property Summary Data Recordfor the contract involved appropriately and notify the contractor in writingof the required changes. (g) In reviewing the contractor's property control system, the propertyadministrator shall consider the provisions of 1845.505-14 and ensure thatthe contractor's system provides for maintaining financial data and furnishingrequired reports within the time limits specified. <ITAG tagnum="80">1845.7208-3</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Exit interview with the contractor.</ITAG>Upon completing the review, the property administrator shall hold an exitinterview with the contractor to discuss any category in which the controlsor procedures were found inadequate and shall advise where corrective actionis required before an approval of the system can be granted. When the contractoris willing to correct a deficiency or questionable practice immediately,the documentation supporting the property administrator's findings andconclusions shall include a statement to this effect. The contracting officerresponsible for the predominant value of NASA property at the facilityshall attend the exit interview with the contractor if major deficienciesexist in the property control system, past deficiencies remain uncorrected,or the value of the personal property involved exceeds $1,000,000.<ITAG tagnum="80">1845.7208-4</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Record of system evaluation.</ITAG>Upon completing the evaluation of the contractor's system, the propertyadministrator shall prepare a written summary of findings to support approvalof the system or any requirement for corrective action before approval.A report of visit or other documentation may be utilized if the participatingcontractor and Government personnel are listed, actions taken are adequatelydescribed, and the property administrator's determination is clearly stated.<ITAG tagnum="80">1845.7208-5</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Notification of deficiencies.</ITAG>If deficiencies have been found, the property administrator shall preparea letter to the contractor for signature by the contracting officer, listingthem and noting any agreement by the contractor to correct them.

Thecontractor shall be requested to confirm in writing any new commitmentsarising from this meeting. If the contractor fails to correct deficienciesin its property control system within a reasonable period, the contractingofficer shall refer the matter by memorandum to appropriate levels of managementwithin the NASA installation and Headquarters staff offices, dependingon the criticality of the problem involved. The memorandum shall include_(a) A specific, concise, and documented statement of the problem;(b) A statement of the contractor's position; and(c) The recommended action.<ITAG tagnum="80">1845.7208-7</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Letter of approval.</ITAG>(a) Approval of a contractor's property control system shall be conditionedupon a joint determination, by the property administrator and the contractingofficer that no deficiencies exist in the property control system or thatonly minor deficiencies exist and the contractor has agreed to correctthem.(b) If the contractor's property control system is acceptable, the propertyadministrator shall advise the contractor in writing. However, if the approvalwas preceded by correspondence between the contracting officer and thecontractor (1845.7208-5 and 1845.7208-6), the property administrator shallreference it in the approval and advise the contractor that the correctiveaction taken or planned is acceptable. A copy of the letter of approvalshall be sent to the contracting officer.

The plan shall provide for surveys andshall be augmented to cover responsibilities imposed by new contracts,changing conditions, or marginal performance. If approval of the contractor'ssystem is unduly delayed at inception of the contract by the contractor'sfailure to provide an acceptable system, or is withdrawn because of unsatisfactoryconditions disclosed after approval, the property administration plan shallbe expanded as necessary to reasonably ensure that loss, damage, or destructionof Government property is disclosed in a timely manner. Special attentionshall be given to reasonably ensuring that any loss, damage, or destructionoccurring during a period when a contractor's system is not approved isidentified before approval or reapproval. (b) The property administrator must exercise judgment in developing theplan and in determining which categories (see Table 1845-1) of the contractor'sproperty control system warrant examination.

Completion of a system survey involving complex propertycontrol systems may require detailed tests and evaluations over an extendedperiod of time. If deficiencies in physical control or records are disclosed,the property administrator must (a) ensure that the contractor takes correctiveaction and (b) evaluate its effectiveness. In such instances, test andevaluation of any one category shall be completed as expeditiously as possible,and the working papers and analysis shall be retained for considerationand incorporation into the summary and survey case file. <ITAG tagnum="80">1845.7209-3 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">System surveys: scheduling and planning. </ITAG>(a) At the beginning of each calendar year, the property administratorshall prepare a schedule showing the names of the contractors and the dateson which each system survey is to be initiated and completed. (b) Before initiating any system survey, the property administrator shallestablish a survey plan providing, as a minimum_(1) Identification and listing of the categories, functional areas, andcharacteristics to be evaluated (see Table 1845-1); (2) Evaluation of approved property control procedures applicable to thecategories to be examined, and noting of any portions of them that shouldbe reviewed with operating personnel for possible updating (if a functionalarea of the property control system is not covered by procedures, no attemptshould be made to survey that area at that time, but that area should berecorded as unsatisfactory and action taken to correct the condition);and (3) Directions for preparing work papers necessary to document the file.<ITAG tagnum="80">1845.7209-4 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Testing the system. </ITAG>In conducting tests of the contractor's property control system, the followingfactors should be considered to assure adequate coverage of requirementspeculiar to particular classes of property and functional areas: (a) <T3>Materials. </T3>Materials should be considered as bulk quantities,as contrasted to individual items. Examinations should be directed to_(1) Tracing inbound transportation units from: (i) Bills of lading or other transportation documents to receiving reports,in order to verify the receiving reports and to ensure that proper actionis taken on shortages, damages, and other discrepancies, and (ii) Stock records to assure that the receipts were accurately posted;(2) Abstracting nomenclature and balance data from stock records and makingphysical counts to determine accuracy of the stock records; (3) Tracing posting of credits to (i) stock records (by date, referencenumber, and quantity) and (ii) issue documents, in order to assure accuracyof the postings and validity of the documents (signature by authorizedindividual and indication of reasons for issue or point of delivery, orboth, to indicate proper contract use); and (4) Determining, to the extent practicable at the point of receipt anduse, whether undue quantities are issued, charged to cost, and held onthe plant floor rather than being held under better security in stores.(b) <T3>Custodial items. </T3>Issues shall be traced from stores records totool cribs, office stock rooms, uniform rooms, and the like, to determinewhether they are taken into account as part of a sound control system.It should be determined that issues to contractor personnel are coveredby tool chits, uniform slips, or other mechanisms to ensure return, orability to locate items to be returned, ensuring that new items are notissued without return of worn-out items or that suitable explanation isprovided. (c) <T3>End items. </T3>General techniques for surveying materials are applicableto end items placed in storage pending shipment. Examination shall includetracing from Government acceptance records of the contractor's claims forreimbursement to physical quantities on hand and quantities on validatedshipping documents. (d) <T3>Plant equipment costing less than $5,000. </T3>If summary stock recordsare used for this class of property, examination using the ``bulk quantities''approach in paragraph (a) of this section is applicable but shall alsocover_(1) Identification if required pursuant to FAR 45.505-5 (any identificationnumbers shall be physically verified); and (2) Location as prescribed in FAR 45.505(g), creating need for physicalverification of presence or absence of the property in the location shownby the location record. (e) <T3>Plant equipment costing $5,000 or more. </T3>Testing on an item-by-itembasis is usually required to achieve desired results. Determinations demandingspecial attention include whether_(1) Government screening and approval requirements are observed; (2) Classification of property is accurate, both at time of requisitionor purchase and at time of receipt, through the use of Cataloging HandbooksH2-1, H2-2, and H2-3; (3) An item is actually applied to the requirement for which acquired,and, if deviation is made, that any necessary notice and Government approvalhave been obtained; (4) Receiving documentation is complete and accurate, indicating assignmentof identification number, treatment of accessory and auxiliary equipmentas required, and the DD Form 1342 (DoD Property Record), or equivalentformat, is prepared and processed when required by 1845.505-670; (5) From physical inspection of the property, the equipment records areaccurate, including location and classification as to use (examinationshall be conducted from property to records and from records to property);and (6) Disposition is initiated as required if equipment is no longer requiredat the plant (examination shall include the adequacy of the procedure forpreparing and submitting DD Form 1342 (Property Record), or equivalentformat, where specified, propriety of authority for shipment, and properaccounting for accessory and auxiliary equipment). (f) <T3>Special test equipment. </T3>The examination of special test equipmentshall be essentially the same as for plant equipment costing $5,000 ormore, except for recognizing the greater complexity of assemblies classifiedas single items and the possible need for assistance and advice of engineeringpersonnel. Examinations shall include tracing of individual componentsinto the assembly to assure a clear trail, particularly with respect togeneral purpose test equipment components, and propriety of dispositionof components upon disassembly. (g) <T3>Special tooling. </T3>Testing for plant equipment, as in paragraphs(d) and (e) of this section, may be used as a guide to establish the methodand sampling for special tooling. When option as to title to special toolingis involved under terms of the contract (see the clause at FAR 52.245-17,Special Tooling), examination need only be sufficient to comply with therequest of the contracting officer. (h) <T3>Real property. </T3>After initial turnover of real property to a contractor,tests and examinations normally shall be directed to work orders of thecontractor and documentation from Government sources as to additions andother capital improvements or disposals or capital decreases. (i) <T3>Scrap and salvage. </T3>Tests relating to scrap and salvage may besimilar to those for materials as outlined in paragraph (a) of this section.However, special attention should be given to_(1) Tracing from credit entries on materials records (showing turn-in toscrap) to corresponding debits to scrap records; (2) Determining from analysis of consumption of materials over a givenperiod that the quantities indicated as being scrapped or spoiled are matchedwith comparable receipts in the scrap and salvage accounts; and(3) Determining that, when conversions of units of property to pounds ofscrap or from estimated to scale weights or to other units of measure aremade, the formula for the conversion is shown on the document affectedor is readily available in the approved contractor procedure.(j) <T3>Analyzing consumption of materials.</T3> It shall be determined byboth physical examination and analysis of records that quantities consumedare for proper purposes and in reasonable amounts. In analyzing consumptionof component parts or other production materials, unit allowance (equallingamount required per end-item plus normal spoilage) for each line item ofmaterials may be available in the contract, bill of materials, blueprints,or shop drawings of items fabricated, or in cost computations supportingthe end-item price. If such unit allowance information is not available,technical personnel may be consulted as to whether quantities consumedare within accepted industry standards.(k) <T3>Testing of physical inventories.</T3> The property administrator hasthe option of conducting tests of the contractor's physical inventorieseither during the performance of the inventory or subsequent to its completion.In either event, tests shall evidence physical counts of selected itemswithout knowledge of record balances, verification of the entries on countslips, comparisons with records, preparation of documents necessary toany adjustments required, approval of adjustments, and the referral oflists of adjustments to the property administrator pursuant to FAR 45.508-2.(l) <T3>Examination of maintenance program.</T3> The property administratorshall trace the actions scheduled to determine whether they have been performedand that the actions stated by the contractor's procedures have been included.Also, records of the maintenance or repair shop or the contractor's purchaseorders shall be examined as to causes of breakdowns of equipment to determinewhether they were the result of inadequate preventive or routine maintenance.<ITAG tagnum="80">1845.7209-5</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Performing the system survey.</ITAG>In performing the system survey, the property administrator shall followthe procedures in paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section.(a)(1) The lot size shall be estimated. Insofar as possible, lots selectedshall consist of all the following current operations of the contractor:(i) Those transactions (excepting disposition transactions) that have occurredduring the last 90 days preceding the date of sampling and the documentsrecording those actions. (If no transactions have taken place during thelast 90 days, samples will be taken from transactions going back to thelast system survey.)(ii) Articles in the possession or control of the contractor at that time.(iii) Dispositions occurring since the last survey was made.(2) The lot should encompass the maximum number of units possible withina functional area. For example, transactions pertaining to special tooling,special test equipment, and plant equipment may be combined into a singlelot and sampled for their common characteristics. Characteristics not commonto units sampled shall be extracted for evaluation as a part of a separatelot.(b) Sample sizes and statistical sampling techniques shall be in accordancewith 1845.7213.(c) After the examinations are performed and the findings recorded, thefindings shall be analyzed and the conclusions and recommendations recorded.Decisions as to satisfactory or unsatisfactory conditions shall be madefor each lot at the functional area level. (d) If any category is found unsatisfactory during a survey, the propertyadministrator shall determine the effects upon the complete system. Allother applicable categories shall be surveyed to identify other defectsand the extent of defectiveness in the overall system. (e) The property administrator shall discuss problems disclosed duringthe survey with the contractor's personnel as they are noted, or duringthe exit interviews, and shall strive to resolve differences informally.Resolved problem areas shall be reported in the record of system evaluation,with the notation that they have been corrected. <ITAG tagnum="80">1845.7209-6 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">System survey summary. </ITAG>(a) The property administrator shall prepare a formal record at the conclusionof each system survey in the format set forth below: (1) <T3>Introduction: </T3>Contractor's name and address, period of survey,and types of property involved.

(b) The property administrator shall forward a summary of the system surveyto the contractor, advising of any unsatisfactory conditions and requestingthe contractor to correct them within the time limitations agreed to duringthe exit interview. The property administrator shall also advise the contractorin this letter that failure to correct the unsatisfactory conditions mayresult in disapproval of its property control system. A copy of the summaryshall also be retained in a survey case file, and whenever unsatisfactoryconditions have been disclosed, a copy of the summary shall be providedto the administrative contracting officer. When conditions dictate (e.g.,indication of significant noncompliance with contract requirements or othercontinued failures jeopardizing the interest of the Government), the purchasingoffice and the pre-award survey monitor shall also be advised in writing.<ITAG tagnum="80">1845.7209-7 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Correction of unsatisfactory conditions. </ITAG>If unsatisfactory conditions are disclosed, the property administratorshall ensure that corrective action is taken.

Therefore,before reaching a conclusion or making a determination, the contractingofficer shall obtain property administrator review of the contract clauseand shall obtain advice from appropriate legal counsel on questions oflegal meaning or intent.(5) ``Willful misconduct'' may involve any intentional or deliberate actor failure to act causing, or resulting in, loss, damage, or destructionof Government property.(6) ``Lack of good faith'' may involve gross neglect or disregard of theterms of the contract or of appropriate directions of the contracting officeror the contracting officer's authorized representatives. Examples of lackof good faith may be demonstrated by the failure of the contractor's managerialpersonnel to establish and maintain proper training and supervision ofemployees and proper application of controls in compliance with instructionsissued by authorized Government personnel.(b) If part of the contractor's system is found to be unsatisfactory, theproperty administrator shall increase surveillance of that part to prevent,to the extent possible, any loss, damage, or destruction of Governmentproperty.

(b) Upon assignment of an initial contract under which Government-ownedplant equipment in particular will be provided to a contractor, the propertyadministrator shall ensure that the contractor has established effectiveprocedures and techniques for controlling its utilization. The propertyadministrator, with the assistance of technical specialists, if necessary,shall evaluate these procedures. A record of the evaluation shall be preparedand become a part of the property administration file. If the proceduresare determined inadequate, the record shall identify the deficiencies andthe corrective actions necessary. If the deficiencies are not correctedby the contractor, the property administrator shall promptly refer thematter to the contracting officer. (c) The property administrator shall perform annual surveys of the contractor'sprocedures related to utilization of Government-owned plant equipment.At contractor facilities having a substantial quantity of plant equipment,the surveys should normally be conducted on a continual basis, reviewingequipment utilization records and physically observing a group of preselecteditems during each portion of the survey. Surveys shall be conducted tothe degree determined necessary, considering the findings of prior surveysand the contractor's performance history in identifying and declaring equipmentexcess to authorized requirements. The contractor shall be required tojustify, by specific Government programs, the retention of all Government-ownedplant equipment. The property administrator shall make maximum use of contractor'smachine loading data, order boards, production planning records, machinetime records, and other production control methods. (d) The property administrator shall conduct a special survey when a significantchange occurs in the contractor's production schedules, such as a termination,completion of a contract, or a major adjustment in a program. Special surveysmay be limited to a given department, activity, or division of a contractor'soperation.

It is used to evaluate and determinethe performance level for each functional area and category within eachproperty control system. The lot to be examined for defects should encompassthe maximum possible number of line items of property, records and documents.All items in the lot must have common characteristics and the same controlelements of the property control system must apply or more than one lotwill be necessary. Items selected for sampling may be used to examine characteristicsof more than one category (i.e., items selected under records may be usedto examine characteristics of acquisition, stock control, storage and movement,maintenance, physical inventory, utilization, and consumption).(b) <T3>Use of statistical sampling plans.</T3> The Government's risk shallnot exceed 10% excepting any slight variations due to changes in lot sizes.Table 1845-2 contains sampling plans for use in achieving a confidencelevel of 90%, i.e., there is 90% confidence of rejecting lots having 10%or more defectives. The sample sizes to be examined may be determined fromeither Table 1845-2A or B.(c) <T3>Random number table.</T3> (1) Use of a table of random numbers is acommon technique for drawing a sample. (A table is available from the NASAHeadquarters Supply and Equipment Management Division (Code NIE).) Howeverrandomization techniques may be applied provided they are defined beforehandin the property administration survey plan and exhibit clear protectionagainst bias. In any event, the number of items in the lot must not beoverestimated to avoid selection of random numbers greater than the lot.For example, if the lot is 9,000, only numbers lower than 9,001 shall beselected. Using a random table to draw a random sample requires the followingfour steps:(i) First step. A pattern must be established between the numbers in thetable and items in the lot to be sampled. It is possible to use the wholerandom number or any portion thereof. For instance, the number 18,967 mayappear in the table. If the lot size is more than 99 but less than 1,000,a three digit number is required and either the first three digits (189)or the last three (967) may be used. If the lot size is more than 999 butless than 10,000, a four digit number is required and either the firstfour digits (1,896) or the last four (8,967) may be used. Once this patternhas been established, it must be consistently used throughout the sampleselection process.(ii) Second step. A procedure for selecting the numbers from the tablemust be selected. Any systematic path for going through the table, if thepath is clear and does not cross over or reuse any number previously used,is acceptable. It is possible to proceed across rows, down columns, diagonally,clockwise, counterclockwise, or in some combinations of these methods;however, it is usually desirable to choose a simple pattern and go downcolumns or across rows.(iii) Third step. The starting point in the table shall be selected atrandom. The most used method is to open the table of random numbers toany page and to use the number indicated by an arbitrarily placed pencilpoint.(iv) Fourth step. Beginning at the starting point and proceeding throughthe table as planned in the second step, record the numbers found in successionin the table, using all or part of the number as planned in the first step.Duplicate numbers shall be skipped. The selection process shall be continueduntil the required sample size is drawn. (2) Numbers taken from the random table shall be arranged and recordedin numerical order. If the units of the lot to be examined are alreadyconsecutively numbered, the units having the numbers corresponding to thosetaken from the random table become the sample units. Otherwise, the sampleunits shall be found by counting to the numbers taken from the random table.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>4,L2,s25,8,8,8</C><T4>Table </T4>1845-2A_Single Sampling Plan <H1>Lot size </H1><H1>Sample size </H1><H1>Limits </H1><H2>Satisfactory </H2><H2>Unsatisfactory</H2><ITAG tagnum="1">1-17 <D>All </D><D>0</D><D>1</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">18-50 <D>17 </D><D>0</D><D>1</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">51-90 <D>31 </D><D>1</D><D>2</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">91-150 <D>44 </D><D>2 </D><D>3</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Over 150 <D>65 </D><D>3 </D><D>4</D></ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Table </T4>1845-2<T4>B </T4><ITAG tagnum="96">Double Sampling Plan </ITAG><H1>Lot range</H1><H1>Sample size 1</H1><H1>Accept if defects in Sample 1 are</H1><H1>Reject if defects in Sample 1 are</H1><H1>Continue with Sample 2 if defects in Sample 1 are</H1><H1>Sample size 2</H1><H1>Accept if sum of defects in Samples 1 and 2 equals or is less than</H1><H1>Reject if sum of defects in Samples 1 and 2 equals or exceeds</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">1-18 <D>All </D><D>0 </D><D>1 </D><D> </D><D> </D><D> </D><D> </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">19-50 <D>19 </D><D>0 </D><D>1 </D><D> </D><D> </D><D> </D><D> </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">51-90 <D>21 </D><D>0 </D><D>2 </D><D>1 </D><D>21 </D><D>1 </D><D>2 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">91-150 <D>25 </D><D>0 </D><D>3 </D><D>1 or 2 </D><D>25 </D><D>2 </D><D>3 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">151-400 <D>32 </D><D>0 </D><D>4 </D><D>1, 2, or 3 </D><D>32 </D><D>3 </D><D>4 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">401-10,000 <D>34 </D><D>0 </D><D>4 </D><D>1, 2, or 3 </D><D>34 </D><D>3 </D><D>4 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">10,001-35,000 <D>40 </D><D>0 </D><D>5 </D><D>1, 2, 3, or 4 </D><D>40 </D><D>4 </D><D>5 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">35,001-100,000 <D>46 </D><D>0 </D><D>6 </D><D>1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 </D><D>46 </D><D>5 </D><D>6 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">100,000+ <D>52 </D><D>0 </D><D>7 </D><D>1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6</D><D>52 </D><D>6 </D><D>7</D></ITAG></ITAG> <ITAG tagnum="52">PART 1846_QUALITY ASSURANCE </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="72">Subpart 1846.2_Contract Quality Requirements</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="70">Sec.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1846.270 Contract clauses for space flight-related operations. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="72">Subpart 1846.4_Government Contract Quality Assurance</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1846.470 Contract clause. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="72">Subpart 1846.6_Material Inspection and Receiving Reports</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1846.670 Introduction. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1846.670-1 General. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1846.670-2 Applicability. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1846.670-3 Use. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1846.670-4 Application. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1846.670-5 Forms. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1846.671 Procurement quality assurance on shipments between contractors.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1846.672 Preparing DD Forms 250 and 250c. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1846.672-1 Preparation instructions. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1846.672-2 Consolidated shipments. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1846.672-3 Correction instructions. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1846.672-4 Invoice instructions. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1846.672-5 Packing-list instructions. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1846.672-6  Receiving instructions. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1846.673 Distribution of DD Forms 250 and 250c. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1846.674 Contract clause. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="72">Subpart 1846.7_Warranties</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1846.703 Criteria for use of warranties. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1846.703-70 Additional criteria. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1846.704 Authority for use of warranties. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1846.709 Warranties of commercial items. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1846.709-70 Limitation. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1846.770 Administration. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority: </T4>42 U.S.C. 2473(c)(1).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="52">Subpart 1846.2_Contract Quality Requirements</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="80">1846.270</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Contract clauses for space flight-related operations.</ITAG>(a) The contracting officer shall insert the clause at 1852.246-70, SpaceTransportation System (STS) Personnel Reliability Program, in solicitationsand contracts involving critical positions in accordance with NASA ManagementInstruction 8610.13.

that particular installation shall be identified as statedin subparagraphs (a) (1) and (2) of this section. Articles, formats, andsimilar language shall be treated as provisions and clauses for purposesof this section 1852.103. (1) A provision or clause shall be numbered using a prefix, a base, anda suffix. The prefix shall be an alphabetical abbreviation of the installationname (e.g., ARC, GSFC, HR, HW, JSC, KSC, LARC, LERC, MSFC, or SSC). Thebase shall be a numeric value beginning with ``52.2,'' with the next twodigits corresponding to the number of the FAR or NASA FAR Supplement subjectpart to which the provision or clause relates. The suffix shall be a hyphenand sequential number assigned within each part. NASA installations shalluse suffix numbers from -90 to <ITAG tagnum="10">-199. For example, the first Johnson Space Center (JSC) provisionor clause relating to Part 36 of the FAR or NASA FAR Supplement shall beJSC 52.236-90, the second JSC 52.236-91, and so forth. Provisions and clausesshall be dated in accordance with FAR 52.101(f). (2) Contracting officers shall identify provisions and clauses as in thefollowing examples:  (i) I.2 BID ENVELOPES (GSFC 52.214-90) (AUGUST 1987) This example is applicablewhen identifying the title of provisions and clauses in solicitations andcontracts using the uniform contract format (UCF). The first number (``I.2'')designates the UCF section and the sequential clause within that section.``GSFC 52.214-90'' specifies the clause number.  (ii) GSFC 52.214-90_Bid Envelopes (AUGUST 1987) This example is applicablein all instances in which the provision or clause citation is not associatedwith the UCF number. (b) Contracting officers shall not number provisions and clauses developedfor individual procurements only. For example, ``F.3 Delivery Proceduresfor Special Hardware'' cites the third clause in Section F of a contractusing the UCF, but has no clause number or date identified with it, indicatingthat the clause was developed for the particular contract it appears in.<ITAG tagnum="80">1852.103-70 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Identification of modified provisions and clauses. </ITAG>When a FAR clause or provision is included in a solicitation or contractand the NFS prescribes a modification, the title line shall identify themodification as shown below.

The investigation acquisition system provides the mechanismfor encouraging the participation of investigators and selecting the investigationswhich contribute most effectively to the advancement of NASA's scientificand technological objectives. It is a system separate and distinct fromthe ordinary acquisition process but requiring the same vigorous managementand discipline to assure compliance with statutory requirements and elementaryconsiderations of equitable treatment. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">101 Key Features of the System</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1. Utilization of the system commences with a Program Associate Administrator'sdetermination that the investigation acquisition process is appropriateand applicable for a program under consideration. There follows a broadlydisseminated Announcement of Opportunity (AO) to the interested community.This solicitation does not generally specify the investigations to be proposedbut rather solicits investigative ideas which contribute to broad objectives.The proposals received are distinctive and innovative. In order to determinewhich of the dissimilar proposals should be selected, a formal competitiveevaluation process is utilized. The evaluation for merit is normally madeby experts in the specific fields represented by the proposals and caretaken to avoid conflicts of interest. These peer evaluators may be fromNASA, other Government agencies, universities, or the commercial sector.Along with or subsequent to the evaluation for merit, the other factorsof the proposals, such as engineering, cost, and integration aspects, arereviewed by specialists in those areas. The evaluation conclusions as wellas considerations of budget and other factors are used to formulate a complementof recommended investigations. A steering committee serving as staff tothe Program Associate Administrator reviews the proposed payload or programof investigation, the iterative process, and the selection recommendations.The steering committee serves as a forum where different interests, suchas flight program, discipline management, and administration, can be weighedand reconciled.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The Program Associate Administrator selects the investigations andthe investigators who shall participate in the program. Once selected,an investigator is assigned appropriate key responsibilities relating tothe investigation through a contract with the institution. In the caseof foreign investigators, these responsibilities will usually be outlinedin an agreement between NASA and the sponsoring governmental agency inthe investigator's country.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. The Announcement of Opportunity process provides a disciplinedapproach to investigation acquisition. The following major steps must befollowed in each case where the determination is made to utilize the investigationacquisition system:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">a. Announcement of Opportunity shall be signed by the appropriateProgram Associate Administrator and shall be widely distributed to thescientific, technological, and applications user communities, as appropriate.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">b. An evaluation team shall be formed including recognized peers ofthe investigators to review the proposals.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">c. A project office will be assigned to assess the engineering, cost,integration, and management aspects of the proposals.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">d. A program office will be responsible to formulate a complementof investigations consistent with the objectives stated in the Announcementof Opportunity, cost, and schedule constraints.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">e. A steering committee appointed by the appropriate Program AssociateAdministrator shall review the proposed investigations for relevance andmerit, will assure compliance with the system as described in this Handbook,and make selection recommendations.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">f. Selections shall be made by the appropriate Program Associate Administrator.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">3. Payloads will be formulated consisting of investigations selectedthrough the Announcement of Opportunity process and/or other authorizedmethods.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">4. When the need is determined by the Program Associate Administrator,payload specialists will be selected in accordance with NMI 7100.16, ``PayloadSpecialists for NASA-Related Payloads.''</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">102 Management Responsibilities</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1. Program Associate Administrators are responsible for overseeingthe process and for making key decisions essential to the process including:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">a. Determination to use the investigation acquisition system.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">b. Appointment of the steering committee members.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">c. Designation of a centralized staff to assure uniformity in theissuance of the Announcement of Opportunity and conformity with the requiredprocedures in the evaluation and selection.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">d. Reuse, to the maximum extent practicable, of space hardware andsupport equipment.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">e. Determination to use advisory subcommittees, contractor, or full-timeGovernment employees only in the evaluation process.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">f. Issuance of the Announcement of Opportunity.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">g. Selection of investigations and investigators, determination ofneed of a definition phase, determination of the role of the investigatorwith regard to providing essential investigation hardware and services,and determination of the need for payload specialists.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">h. Assure due consideration is given to minorities in the establishmentof peer groups, distribution of the Announcement of Opportunity, and inthe selection of investigations.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">i. Provide a timely, flexible framework for cooperative foreign participationin Space Shuttle, Spacelab, and Space Station missions.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. Exercise of these responsibilities will require the professionalassistance of experts in several functional, programmatic, and technicaldisciplines. The Program Associate Administrator should call upon suchexperts at appropriate times throughout the process. The remaining chaptersof this Handbook will discuss the exercise of the foregoing responsibilitiesin greater detail.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="74">Chapter 2_Applicability of the Process</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">200 General</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The system used for acquisition of investigations is separate anddistinct from the agency procedures for procurement of known requirementsof hardware and services. A decision to use this special acquisition processwill be based on a considered determination, in accordance with the generalguidance in this chapter, that it is the most suitable to meet programneeds. The decision-making official will consider the criteria for useof the system. The project plan or other program or project documentationshould discuss the proposed mode of investigations selection.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">201 Criteria for Determining Applicability</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1. The decision to utilize the investigations acquisition processas an alternative to the normal planning and acquisition process of theagency can only be made after consideration of the special conditions whichare requisite to its use. All of the following conditions should existbefore deciding that the system is appropriate and applicable:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">a. NASA has a general objective which can be furthered through unique,novel, experimental approaches. To develop such novel approaches, NASAwishes to draw upon the broadest reservoir of ideas that can be made available.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">b. Choices must be made among competing dissimilar ideas in expandingknowledge of phenomena in the atmosphere and space.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">c. Individual participation of an investigator is essential to exploitationof the opportunity. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. The investigations acquisition process shall not be used when anyof the following characteristics are present:  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">a. The requiring office can define a requirement sufficiently to allowfor normal procurement. This includes requirements that can be stated asdesign or performance specifications, including requirements for the useof known technology and hardware, and requirements for continuation ofexisting tasks.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">b. The program is extremely complex, requiring specialized integration,coordination, or other special handling, or extending over a lengthy periodwherein individual participation is not essential.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">c. It is not possible or considered essential to the program to followthe critical steps of the special investigations acquisition process. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">202 Programs and Activities Where Use May Be Considered </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1. <T3>General.</T3> The investigation acquisition process is most suitablefor investigations aimed at exploration requiring several unique sensorsor instruments, but it has been used successfully and advantageously inseveral types of opportunity. Each program is unique and the opportunitiesfor participation in investigative effort will necessarily vary from programto program. Similarly, program implementation plans may provide opportunitiesfor participation but may not meet the conditions necessary for use ofthe special investigations acquisition process. In those latter cases,the normal procurement procedures will be followed to meet the programneeds. Because of the differences in programs, only general standards canbe given to guide the decision of whether or not to use the alternate acquisitionprocess. There follows a discussion of several types of programs, the opportunitiesthey offer, and comment on the suitability of the special process. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. <T3>Exploration and Space Research Flights</T3>_a. <T3>Examples. </T3>Space Transportation System (STS) flights with attachedpayloads, generally Spacelab payloads; and free-flying spacecraft, suchas Explorers, Pioneers, Space Telescope, Landsats, and Long Duration ExposureFacilities.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">b. <T3>Types of Opportunity.</T3> (1) A common and sought after opportunityis to participate as a Principal Investigator responsible for conceivingand conducting a space investigation. This may involve a major piece ofinstrumentation. In the case of a ``facility'' or ``multiuser'' payload,each Principal Investigator's responsibilities would ordinarily involvea relatively minor portion of the total instrument.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) There may also be an opportunity to serve on a Principal Investigator'steam as a team member or as a Co-Investigator.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(3) A type of opportunity that generally involves the use of datafrom another investigator's instrument is that of guest investigator orguest observer. Guest investigators usually participate after the primaryobjectives have been satisfied for the investigations involved.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(4) A team may be formed from selected investigators to assist indefining planned mission objectives and/or to determine, in a general manner,the most meaningful instruments to accomplish the mission objectives. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">c. <T3>Selection and Acquisition Procedures.</T3> The investigation acquisitionprocess may be applicable to all of these types of opportunities. The suppositioncommon in these opportunities is that the best ideas and approaches arelikely to result from the broadest possible involvement of the scientific,technological or applications user communities. Most free-flying spacecraftrepresent single flight opportunities in contrast to Spacelab payload acquisitionwhich may have a number of discipline objectives since the flight opportunitiesare frequent and recurring. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">3. <T3>Minor Missions</T3>_a. <T3>Examples.</T3> Research aircraft, sounding rockets, balloons, and minormissions are generally of short duration, small in size, often single purpose,and subject to repetition. Many investigations are follow-on to past-flightinvestigations.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">b. <T3>Types of Opportunity.</T3>  (1) Principal Investigators responsiblefor investigation.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) Data use or analysis.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">c. <T3>Selection and Acquisition Process.</T3> Opportunities for participationon minor missions are generally suitable for normal procurement procedures.The use of a general announcement announcing the general nature and scheduleof flights may be appropriate when considered necessary to broaden participationby requesting investigator-initiated research proposals. Procurement proceduresas contained in NASA FAR Supplement shall be used for follow-on repeatflights. Although NASA seeks unique, innovative ideas for these missions,the prospect of reflight and the latitude in determining number and scheduleof flights argue against the need for the use of the investigations acquisitionprocess to force dissimilar proposals into an annual or periodic competitivestructure. On the other hand, there are some minor missions addressed tospecific limited opportunities; for example, a solar eclipse. When suchlimitations indicate that the special competitive structure is needed,it should be authorized. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">4. <T3>Operational and Operational Prototype Spacecraft</T3>_a. <T3>Examples. </T3>GOES, TIROS.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">b. <T3>Selection and Acquisition Process.</T3> The user agency can be expectedto specify performance parameters.

Proposals can be solicited or unsolicited and canbe entertained within the context of the normal procurement procedure.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">203 Specific Approval Required </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The Program Associate Administrator responsible for the program isalso responsible for determining whether or not to use the special investigationsacquisition process. Normally on major projects, or when a project planis required, use of the investigation acquisition system will be justifiedand recommended in the project planning documentation and will be coordinatedwith staff offices and discussed in the planning presentation to the DeputyAdministrator or designee. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="74">Chapter 3_The Announcement of Opportunity </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">300 General </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The essence of the competitive solicitation is through use of an Announcementof Opportunity. The Announcement is characterized by its generality sinceNASA has not pre-determined a specific and finite objective but only thegeneral objective of the investigations. Notwithstanding its general nature,it is essential that the Announcement of Opportunity contains sufficientdata in order to obtain meaningful proposals. To a considerable extent,the detail and depth of the Announcement will depend on the investigativeobjective. In all cases, judgment is of paramount importance, since thepurpose is to get adequate information to assess the relevance, merit,cost, and management without overburdening the proposer. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">301 Need for Preparatory Effort </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1. When the use of the Announcement process is contemplated, thereis need to consult with appropriate Headquarters offices and the ProjectInstallation responsible for the project prior to release of the Announcement.These consultations will require early involvement of the Project Installationand appropriate Headquarters offices in the investigation acquisition process.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. In addition, the need to meet legal requirements in the acquisitionprocesses will require early external Program Office involvement to: </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">a. Synopsize the Announcement in the Commerce Business Daily priorto the time of release. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">b. Determine if there is instrumentation or support equipment availablewhich may be appropriate to the Announcement with all necessary backgrounddata considered essential for use by a proposer. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">c. Determine mailing lists, including the mailing list maintainedby the International Affairs Division, Office of External Relations, forbroad dissemination of the Announcement to the appropriate recipients.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">d. Assure mandatory provisions are contained in the Announcement.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">3. Other methods of dissemination of the Announcement may also beused, such as the use of press releases, etc. When possible, the Announcementshould be widely publicized through publications of appropriate professionalsocieties; however, NASA policy does not allow payment for the placementof advertisements. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">302 Responsibilities </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1. The Program Office originator is responsible for the content ofthe Announcement and that coordination with concerned Headquarters officesand field installations has been accomplished. All personnel involved inthe evaluation of investigative proposals are responsible for familiarizingthemselves and complying with this Handbook and other applicable regulations.To this end, they are expected to seek the advice and guidance of appropriateHeadquarters program and staff offices, and Project Installation management.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. The Program Office is also responsible for coordinating the Announcementof Opportunity with the International Affairs, Educational Affairs, ManagementSupport Divisions, Office of External Relations, Office of General Counsel,and Office of Procurement prior to issuance. Attention is directed to NMI1362.1, ``Initiation and Development of International Participation andCooperation in Aeronautical and Space Programs.'' </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">3. Concurrence of the Office of Procurement is required before issuanceof an Announcement of Opportunity. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">303 Proposal Opportunity Period </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1. The Announcement of Opportunity is considered the primary methodof soliciting investigations. As such, it is necessary that the processaccommodate the continuous opportunities afforded by the Shuttle/Spacelabflights. Thus, the following methods may be utilized, individually or incombination, to enable an Announcement and resultant proposals to be openfor an extended period of time and/or to cover a series or range of flightpossibilities or disciplines: </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">a. The Announcement may be issued establishing a number of proposalsubmission dates. Normally, no more than three proposal submission datesshould be established. The submittal dates may be spread over the numberof months most compatible with the possible flight opportunities and theavailability of resources necessary to evaluate and fund the proposals.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">b. The Announcement may be issued establishing a single proposal submissiondate. However, the Announcement could provide that NASA may amend the Announcementto provide for subsequent dates for submission of proposals, if additionalinvestigations are desired within the Announcement objectives. In thiscase, the initiative to reopen is a management determination. If sufficientinvestigations are selected to satisfy the Announcement objectives or theflight possibilities as a result of the first submission, subsequent opportunitiesfor proposal submission by potential investigators would not be available.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">c. The Announcement may be issued to provide for an initial submissiondate with the Announcement to remain open for submission of additionalproposals up to a final cutoff date. This final date should be relatedto the availability of resources necessary to evaluate the continuous flowof proposals, the time remaining prior to the flight opportunity(s) contemplatedby the Announcement, and payload funding and availability. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. Generally, a core or primary payload of investigations would beselected from the initial submission of proposals under the above methodsof open-ended Announcements. These selections could be final or tentativerecognizing the need for further definition. Proposals received by subsequentsubmission dates would be considered in the scope of the original Announcementbut would be subject to the opportunities and resources remaining availableor the progress being made by prior selected investigations. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">3. Any investigation proposal, whether received on the initial submissionor subsequent submission, requires notification to the investigator andthe investigator's institution of the proposal disposition. Some of theproposals will be rejected completely and the investigators immediatelynotified. The remaining unselected proposals may, if agreeable with theproposers, be held for later consideration and funding and the investigatorso notified. However, if an investigator's proposal is considered at alater date by NASA, the investigator must be given an opportunity to validatethe proposal with the investigator's institution and for updating the costand other data contained in the original submission prior to a final selection.In summary, NASA may retain proposals, receiving Category I, II, or IIIclassifications (see paragraph 403), for possible later sponsorship untilno longer feasible to consider the proposal. When this final stage is reached,the investigator must be promptly notified. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">4. If the intent is to hold proposals for possible later consideration,as discussed in subparagraph 3, the Announcement should specifically indicatethis intent and the procedure to be used. Proposing investigators not desiringtheir proposals be held for later consideration should be given the opportunityto so indicate in their original submissions. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">304 Guidelines for Announcement of Opportunity</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1. The preparation of the Announcement of Opportunity should be amultifunctional effort. It involves program and project management andusually involves other offices of NASA. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. The Announcement should be tailored to the particular needs ofthe contemplated investigations and be complete in itself. Each Announcementwill be identified as (Program Office) originated and numbered consecutivelyeach calendar year, e.g., OSSA-1-86, OSSA-2-86; OAST-1-86; OSTDS-1-86;etc. The required format and detailed instructions regarding the contentsof the Announcement are contained in Appendix A. They are summarized asfollows:  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">a. <T3>Description of the Opportunity. </T3>The basic purpose or aims of theopportunity.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">b. <T3>Announcement Objectives. </T3>A succinct statement of the specificscientific, applications, and/or technological objectives.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">c. <T3>Background. </T3>An explanation of the context of the opportunity inrelation to broader objectives, other disciplines, and prior studies andinvestigations.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">d. <T3>Proposal Opportunity Period. </T3>The period in which the Announcementopportunity will remain open for receipt of proposals.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">e. <T3>Requirements and Constraints. </T3>Technical, programmatic, cost, andschedule requirements or limitations.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">f. <T3>Proposal Submission Information. </T3>Information relating to the proposalsubmission procedure.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">g. <T3>Proposal Evaluation, Selection, and Implementation. </T3>The notificationto the proposers of the evaluation criteria and the manner of proposalevaluation.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">h. <T3>Schedule. </T3>Scheduled dates for activities related in the Announcement. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">i. <T3>Appendices. </T3>The General Instructions and Provisions and any otherappendices that are pertinent to the Announcement. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">3. The General Instructions and Provisions (Appendix B) are necessaryto accommodate the unique aspects of the Announcement of Opportunity process.The instructions and provisions inform potential investigators and theirinstitutions of certain prerogatives of the selection official and of proceduralrequirements dictated by law and regulation. Therefore, they must be appendedto each Announcement of Opportunity. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">4. At the time of issuance, copies of the Announcement must be furnishedto the Office of Procurement and to the Office of General Counsel. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">5. Proposers should be informed of significant departures from scheduleddates for activities related in the Announcement. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">305 Announcement of Opportunity Soliciting Foreign Participation </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Proposals for participation by individuals outside the U.S. shouldbe submitted in the same format (excluding cost plans) as U.S. proposals;they should be typewritten and be in English; the proposals should be reviewedand endorsed by the appropriate foreign governmental agency. If lettersof ``Notice of Intent'' are required, the Announcement should indicatethat they be sent to NASA's International Affairs Division, Office of ExternalRelations. Should a foreign proposal be selected, NASA will arrange withthe sponsoring foreign agency for the proposed participation on a no-exchange-of-fundsbasis, in which NASA and the sponsoring agency will each bear the costof discharging its respective responsibilities. Note that additional guide-linesapplicable to foreign proposers are contained in the Management Plan Sectionof Appendix C (see section II) and must be included in any Guidelines forProposal Preparation or otherwise furnished to foreign proposers. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">306 Guidelines for Proposal Preparation</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">While not all of the guidelines outlined in Appendix C will be applicablein response to every Announcement, the investigator should be informedof the relevant information required to allow for an evaluation of theinvestigator's proposal. The proposal may be submitted on a form to besupplied by the Program Office. However, the proposal should be submittedin at least two sections: (1) Investigation and Technical Section; and(2) Management and Cost Section as described in Appendix C.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="74">Chapter 4_Evaluation of Proposals</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">400 General</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The evaluation process assures consideration of the several aspectsof each proposal and constitutes a series of progressive sorting of theproposals. A review resulting in a categorization is performed by usingone of the methods or combination of the methods outlined in paragraph402. The purpose of this initial review is to determine the scientificand/or technological merit of the proposals in the context of the Announcementobjectives.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Those proposals which are considered to have the greatest scientificor technological merit are then reviewed in detail for the engineering,management, and cost aspects, usually by the Project Office at the installationresponsible for the project. Final reviews are performed by the ProgramOffice and the Steering Committee and are aimed at developing a group ofinvestigations which represent an integrated payload or a well-balancedprogram of investigation which has the best possibility for meeting theannounced scientific, applications, and/or technological objectives, andwithin programmatic constraints. The importance of considering the interrelationshipof the several aspects of the proposals to be reviewed in the process andthe need for carefully planning their treatment should not be overlooked.An evaluation plan has been found helpful to the evaluators, program managementofficials, and the selection official. The evaluation plan should be developedbefore issuance of the Announcement of Opportunity. It should cover therecommended staffing for any subcommittee or contractor support, reviewguidelines as well as the procedural flow and schedule of the evaluation.While not mandatory, such a plan should be considered for each Announcement.A fuller discussion of the evaluation and selection process is includedin the following paragraphs.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">401 Criteria for Evaluation</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1. The fundamental aim of the investigations acquisition process isthe acquisition of those unique ideas and capabilities which best fulfillan Announcement's stated scientific, applications, and/or technologicalobjectives. In furtherance of this goal, each Announcement must indicatethose criteria which the evaluators will apply when assessing the meritof a proposal. The relative importance of each criterion must also be statedin the Announcement. The provision of this information will allow prospectiveinvestigators to make informed judgments in their attempt to formulateproposals that best meet the stated objectives.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. Following is a list of general evaluation criteria which wouldbe appropriate for inclusion in most Announcements:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">a. The scientific, applications, and/or technological merit of theinvestigation.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">b. The relevance of the proposed investigation to the Announcement'sstated scientific, applications, and/or technological objectives.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">c. The competence and experience of the investigator and any investigativeteam, as an indication of the investigator's ability to carry the investigationto a successful conclusion.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">d. Adequacy of whatever apparatus may be proposed with particularregard to its ability to supply the data needed for the investigation.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">e. The reputation and interest of the investigator's institution,as measured by the willingness of the institution to provide the supportnecessary to ensure that the investigation can be completed satisfactorily.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In addition to or in lieu of the criteria listed herein, additionalcriteria may be utilized. In all cases, the evaluation criteria must begermane to the accomplishment of the stated objectives.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">3. Cost and management aspects will be considered in all selections.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">4. Once the evaluation criteria and their relative importance aredisseminated through issuance of the Announcement, it is essential thatthey be applied in a uniform manner. If it becomes apparent, before thedate set for receipt of proposals, that the criteria or their relativeimportance should be changed, the Announcement will be amended, and allknown recipients will be informed of the change and given an adequate opportunityto consider it in submission of their proposals. Evaluation criteria and/ortheir relative importance will not be changed after the date set for receiptof proposals.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">402 Methods of Evaluation</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1. Alternative methods are available to initiate the evaluation ofproposals received in response to an Announcement of Opportunity. Theseare referred to hereinafter as the Advisory Subcommittee Evaluation Process,the Contractor Evaluation Process, and the Government Evaluation Process.In all processes, a subcommittee of the appropriate Program Office SteeringCommittee will be formed for the purpose of categorizing the proposals.The various approaches, described in detail in paragraph 403, are summarizedas follows:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">a. Advisory Subcommittee Evaluation Process_An advisory subcommitteeof the appropriate Program Office Steering Committee may be establishedto evaluate the scientific, applications, or technological merit of theproposals and to categorize them. This method envisions the use of non-Governmentpeers or a combination of non-Government and Government peers. The impactof using one of the open-ended Announcement methods should be consideredin establishing the subcommittee.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">b. Contractor Evaluation Process_In some instances, it may be necessaryfor NASA to utilize a contractor to assist in evaluation of proposals.The contractor would not provide advice or recommendations to the agencynor categorize the proposals but would assist by submitting a summary ofeach proposal along with a listing of its major strengths and weaknessesto the Program Office. The Program Office, using full-time Government employeesappointed as a subcommittee of the Program Office Steering Committee, will,upon consideration of the contractor's report, categorize the proposals.This method may also be used to aid an advisory subcommittee establishedas indicated in subparagraph a. in which event the categorization functionwill be performed by the advisory subcommittee.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">c. Government Evaluation Process_In certain circumstances, such asthose situations where the establishment of an advisory subcommittee isnot feasible, it may be appropriate to appoint or assign full-time Governmentemployee(s) as a subcommittee of the Program Office Steering Committeeto perform the evaluation and categorization of proposals.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. Following categorization under one of the methods outlined in subparagraphsa. through c., those proposals still in consideration will be processedto the selection official as prescribed hereafter.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">403 Advisory Subcommittee Evaluation Process </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1. Evaluation of scientific and/or technological merit of proposedinvestigations is the responsibility of an advisory subcommittee of theSteering Committee. It is of prime importance that the appointment of membersto the subcommittee be weighed carefully as these individuals may exercisesignificant influence on the selection of investigations and hence achievementof program goals and objectives. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. The subcommittee constitutes a peer group qualified to judge thescientific and technological aspects of all investigation proposals submittedin a specific program. For a given application of the process, one or moresubcommittees may be established depending on the breadth of the technicalor scientific disciplines inherent in the Announcement's objectives. Eachsubcommittee represents a discipline or grouping of closely related disciplines.To maximize the quality of the subcommittee evaluation and categorization,the following conditions of selection and appointment should be considered.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">a. The subcommittee normally should be established on an ad hoc basisfor the particular objectives referenced in the Announcement. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">b. Qualifications and broad acknowledgment of the professional abilitiesof the subcommittee members are of primary importance. Institutional affiliations,per se, are not sufficient qualifications. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">c. The executive secretary of the subcommittee must be a full-timeNASA employee. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">d. Subcommittee members should normally be appointed as early as possibleand prior to receipt of proposals. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">e. In selecting members, care must be taken to avoid conflicts ofinterest. These include financial interests, institutional affiliations,professional biases and associations, as well as familiar relationships.Conflicts could further occur as a result of imbalance between Governmentand non-Government appointees, a member evaluating a proposal from theperson's parent organization, or membership from institutions representinga singular school of thought in discipline areas involving competitivetheories in approach to an investigation. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">f. The subcommittee should convene as a group in closed sessions forproposal evaluation to protect the proposer's proprietary ideas and toallow frank discussion of the proposer's qualifications and the merit ofthe proposer's ideas. Lead review responsibility for each proposal maybe assigned to members most qualified in the involved discipline. It isimportant that each proposal be considered by the entire subcommittee.It is only through this action that dissimilar ideas are forced into opencompetition. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">3. It may not be possible to select a subcommittee fully satisfyingall of the conditions described in subparagraph 2. For example, the mostqualified specialists in a particularly narrow discipline may themselves,or some other part of their parent organization, be submitting proposals.It is not the purpose of these guidelines to establish provisions for makingtradeoffs, where necessary, among the above criteria (see subparagraph2). This is properly the responsibility of the nominating and appointingofficials. This latitude permits flexibility in making decisions in accordwith circumstances of each application. In so doing, however, it is emphasizedthat recognized expertise in evaluating dissimilar proposals is essentialto the continued workability of the investigation acquisition process.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">4. Candidate subcommittee members should be nominated by the officehaving responsibility for the evaluation. Nominations should be approvedin accordance with NMI 1150.2, ``Establishment, Operation, and Durationof NASA Advisory Committees.'' The notification of appointment should specifythe duration of assignment on the subcommittee, provisions concerning conflictsof interest, and arrangements regarding honoraria, per diem, and travelwhen actually employed. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">5. It is important that members of the subcommittee be formally instructedas to their responsibilities with respect to the investigation acquisitionprocess, even where several or all of the members have served previously.This briefing of subcommittee members should include: </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">a. Instruction of subcommittee members on agency policies and procedurespertinent to acquisition of investigations. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">b. Review of the program goals, announcement objectives, and evaluationcriteria, including relative importance, which provide the basis for evaluation.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">c. Instruction on the use of preliminary proposal evaluation datafurnished by the Installation Project Office. The subcommittee should examinethese data to gain a better understanding of the proposed investigations,any associated problems, and to consider cost in relation to the valueof the investigations' objectives. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">d. Definition of responsibility of the subcommittee for evaluationand categorization with respect to scientific</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="20">and/or technical merit in accordance with the evaluation criteria.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">e. Instruction for documentation of deliberations and categorizationsof the subcommittee. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">f. Inform the chairperson of the subcommittee and all members thatthey should familiarize themselves with the provisions of the current ``Standardsof Conduct for NASA Employees'', NHB 1900.1, or ``Standards of Conductfor NASA Special Government Employees'', NHB 1900.2, as appropriate, regardingconflicts of interest. Members should inform the appointing authority iftheir participation presents a real or apparent conflict of interest situation.In addition, all participants should inform the selection official in theevent they are subjected to pressure or improper contacts. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">g. Inform members that prior to the selection and announcement ofthe successful investigators and investigations, subcommittee members andNASA personnel shall not reveal any information concerning the evaluationto anyone who is not also participating in the same evaluation proceedings,and then only to the extent that such information is required in connectionwith such proceedings. Also, inform members that subsequent to selectionof an investigation and announcement of negotiations with the investigator'sinstitution, information concerning the proceedings of the subcommitteeand data developed by the subcommittee will be made available to otherswithin NASA only when the requester demonstrates a need to know for a NASApurpose. Such information will be made available to persons outside NASA,including other Government agencies, only when such disclosure is concurredin by the Office of General Counsel. In this connection, reference is madeto 18 U.S.C. 1905 which provides criminal sanctions if any officer or employee(including special employees) of the United States discloses or divulgescertain kinds of business confidential and trade secret information unlessauthorized by law. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">6. The product of an advisory subcommittee is the classification ofproposals into four categories. The categories are: </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">a. <T3>Category I. </T3>Well conceived and scientifically and technicallysound investigations pertinent to the goals of the program and the Announcement'sobjectives and offered by a competent investigator from an institutioncapable of supplying the necessary support to ensure that any essentialflight hardware or other support can be delivered on time and that datacan be properly reduced, analyzed, interpreted, and published in a reasonabletime. Investigations in Category I are recommended for acceptance and normallywill be displaced only by other Category I investigations. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">b. <T3>Category II. </T3>Well conceived and scientifically or technicallysound investigations which are recommended for acceptance, but at a lowerpriority than Category I. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">c. <T3>Category III. </T3>Scientifically or technically sound investigationswhich require further development. Category III investigations may be fundedfor development and may be reconsidered at a later time for the same orother opportunities.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">d. <T3>Category IV. </T3>Proposed investigations which are recommended forrejection for the particular opportunity under consideration, whateverthe reason. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">7. A record of the deliberations of the subcommittee should be preparedby the assigned executive secretary and should be signed by the Chairperson.The minutes should contain the categorizations with basic rationale forsuch ratings and the significant strengths and weaknesses of the proposalsevaluated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">404 Contractor Evaluation Process </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1. The use of the contractor method for obtaining support for evaluationpurposes of proposals received in response to an Announcement of Opportunityrequires the specific approval of the Program Associate Administrator.Prior to the use of this method, discussion should be held with the Officeof Procurement. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. It is NASA policy to avoid situations in the procurement processwhere, by virtue of the work or services performed for NASA, or as a resultof data acquired from NASA or from other entities, a particular company: </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">a. Is given an unfair competitive advantage over other companies withrespect to future NASA business;  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">b. Is placed in a position to affect Government actions under circumstancesin which there is potential that the company's judgment may be biased;or  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">c. Otherwise finds that a conflict exists between the performanceof work or services for the Government in an impartial manner and the company'sown self-interest. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">3. To reduce the possibility of an organizational conflict of interestproblem arising, the following minimum restrictions will apply and be incorporatedinto the contract:  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">a. No employee of the contractor will be permitted to propose in responseto the Announcement of Opportunity;  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">b. The ``Limitation on Future Contracting'' clause contained in NASAFAR Supplement 1852.209-71 and the conditions set forth in NASA FAR Supplement1815.413-2 Alternate II (c) and (d) will be included in all such contracts;and  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">c. Unless authorized by the NASA contracting officer, the contractorshall not contact the originator of any proposal concerning its contents. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">4. The scope of work for the selected contractor will provide foran identification of strengths and weaknesses and a summary of the proposals.The contractor will not make selections nor recommend investigations.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">5. The steps to be taken in establishing evaluation panels and theresponsibilities of NASA and the contractor in relation to the panels willbe as follows:   </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">a. The contractor will be required to establish and provide supportto panels of experts for review of proposals to evaluate their scientificand technical merit;  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">b. These panels will be composed of scientists and specialists qualifiedto evaluate the proposals;  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">c. The agency may provide to the contractor lists of scientist(s)and specialist(s) in the various disciplines it believes are qualifiedto serve on the panels;  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">d. The contractor will report each panel's membership to NASA forapproval; and       </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">e. The contractor must make all the necessary arrangements with thepanel members.   </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">6. The evaluation support by the contractor's panels of experts willbe accomplished as follows:   </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">a. The panels will review the scientific and technical merit of theproposals in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in the Announcementand will record their strengths and weaknesses.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">b. The contractor will make records of each panel's deliberationswhich will form the basis for a report summarizing the results of the evaluations.Upon request, the contractor shall provide all such records to NASA;  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">c. The chairperson of each panel should certify that the evaluationreport correctly represents the findings of the review panel; and  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">d. A final report will be submitted as provided in the contract.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">7. A subcommittee of the Program Office Steering Committee will beestablished on an ad hoc basis. Utilizing furnished data, the subcommitteewill classify the proposals into the four categories enumerated in paragraph403, ``Advisory Subcommittee Evaluation Process.'' A record of the deliberationsof the subcommittee should be prepared by an assigned executive secretaryand signed by the chairperson. The minutes should contain the categorizationswith the basic rationale for such ratings and the significant strengthsand weaknesses of the proposals evaluated.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">405 Government Evaluation Process   </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1. The Program Associate Administrator may, in accordance with NMI1150.2, appoint one or more full-time Government employees as subcommitteemembers of the Program Office Steering Committee to evaluate and categorizethe proposals.   </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. Each subcommittee member should be qualified and competent to evaluatethe proposals in accordance with the Announcement evaluation criteria.It is important that a subcommittee's evaluation be uninfluenced by otherseither within or outside of NASA.   </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">3. The subcommittee members will not contact the proposers for additionalinformation.    </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">4. The subcommittee members will classify the proposals in accordancewith the four categories indicated in paragraph 403. Each categorizationwill be supported by an appropriate rationale      including a narrativeof each proposal's strengths and weaknesses. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">406 Engineering, Integration, and Management Evaluation   </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1. The subcommittee responsible for categorization of each proposalin terms of its scientific, applications, or technical merit should receiveinformation on probable cost, technical status, developmental risk, integrationand safety problems, and management arrangements in time for their deliberations.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. This information should be provided, where appropriate, at thediscretion of the Headquarters Program Office by the Project Office atthe cognizant installation. This information can be in fairly gross, generalterms and should reflect what insights the Project Office can provide withoutrequesting additional details from the proposers. This limited ProjectOffice review will not normally give the subcommittees information of significantprecision. The purpose is to give the subcommittee sufficient informationso it can review the proposals in conjunction with available cost, integration,and management considerations to gain an impression of each investigator'sunderstanding of the problems of the experiment and to permit gross trade-offsof cost versus value of the investigation objective.       </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">3. Following categorization, the Project Office shall evaluate proposalsstill in contention, in depth, including a thorough review of each proposal'sengineering, integration, management, and cost aspects. This review shouldbe accomplished by qualified engineering, cost, and business analysts atthe project center. The review must be a regular part of the evaluationand selection process.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">4. In assessing proposed costs, the evaluation must consider:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">a. The investigation objective.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">b. Comparable, similar or related investigations.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">c. Whether NASA or the investigator should procure the necessary supportinginstrumentation or services and the relative cost of each mode.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">d. Total overall or probable costs to the Government including integrationand data reduction and analysis. In the case of investigations proposedby Government investigators, this includes all associated direct and indirectcost. With respect to cooperative investigations, integration, and otherapplicable costs should be considered.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">5. The Project Office, as part of the in-depth evaluation of proposalsthat require instrumentation or support equipment, will survey all potentialsources for Government-owned instrumentation or support equipment thatmay be made available, with or without modifications, to the potentialinvestigator. Such items contributed by foreign cooperating groups whichare still available under cooperative project agreements will also be consideredfor use under the terms and conditions specified in the agreements. Aspart of the evaluation report to the Program Office, the availability ornonavailability of instrumentation or support equipment will be indicated.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">6. Proposals which require instrumentation should be evaluated byproject personnel. This evaluation should cover the interfaces and theassessment of development risks. This evaluation should furnish the selectionofficial with sufficient data to contribute to the instrument determinations.Important among these are:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">a. Whether the instrument requires further definition;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">b. Whether studies and designs are necessary to provide a reasonablyaccurate appreciation of the cost;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">c. Whether the investigation can be carried out without incurringundue cost, schedule, or risk of failure penalties; and</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">d. Whether integration of the instrument is feasible.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">7. In reviewing an investigator's management plan, the Project Officeshould evaluate the investigator's approach for efficiently managing thework, the recognition of essential management functions, and the effectiveoverall integration of these functions. Evaluation of the proposals underfinal consideration should include, but not be limited to: workload_presentand future related to capacity and capability; past experience; managementapproach and organization; e.g.:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">a. With respect to workload and its relationship to capacity and capability,it is important to ascertain the extent to which the investigator is capableof providing facilities and personnel skills necessary to perform the requiredeffort on a timely basis. This review should reveal the need for additionalfacilities or people, and provide some indication of the Government supportthe investigator will require.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">b. A review should be made of the investigator, the investigator'sinstitution, and any supporting contractor's performance on prior investigations.This should assist in arriving at an assessment of the investigator andthe institution's ability to perform the effort within the proposed costand time constraints.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">c. The proposed investigator's management arrangements should be reviewed,including make or buy choices, support of any co-investigator, and preselectedsubcontractors or other instrument fabricators to determine whether sucharrangements are justified. The review should determine if the proposedmanagement arrangements enhance the investigator's ability to devote moretime to the proposed experiment objectives and still effectively employthe technical and administrative support required for a successful investigation.In making these evaluations, the Project Office should draw on the installation'sengineering, business, legal, and other staff resources, as necessary,as well as its scientific resources. If further information is needed fromthe proposers, it should be obtained through the proper contacts. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">407 Program Office Evaluation </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1. A Program Office responsible for the project or program at Headquarterswill receive the evaluation of the several aspects of the proposals, andweigh the evaluative data to determine an optimum payload or program ofinvestigation. This determination will involve recommendations concerningindividual investigations; but, more importantly, should result in a payloador program which is judged to optimize total mission return within schedule,engineering, and budgetary constraints. The recommendations so made shouldfacilitate sound selection decisions by the Program Associate Administrator.Three sets of recommendations result from the Program Office evaluation:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">a. Optimum payload or program of investigations, or options for alternativepayloads or programs. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">b. Recommendation for final or tentative selection based on a determinationof the degree of uncertainty associated with individual investigations.A tentative selection may be considered step one of a two-step selectiontechnique. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">c. Upon consideration of the guidelines contained in paragraph 501-lc,recommending responsibility for instrument development. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. The cognizant Installation Project Office evaluation is principallyconcerned with ensuring that the proposed investigation can be managed,developed, integrated, and executed with an appropriate probability oftechnical success within the estimated probable cost. The Headquartersprogram Director, drawing upon these inputs, should be mainly concernedwith determining a payload or program from the point of view of programmaticgoals and budgetary constraints. Discipline and cost trade-offs are consideredat this level. The Headquarters Program Office should focus on the potentialcontribution to program objectives that can be achieved under alternativefeasible payload integration options. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">3. It may be to NASA's advantage to consider certain investigationsfor tentative selection pending resolution of uncertainties in their development.Such tentative selections should be reconsidered after a period of timefor final selection in a payload or program of investigations. This two-stepselection process should be considered when: </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">a. The potential return from the investigation is sufficient, relativeto that of the other investigations under consideration, and that its furtherdevelopment appears to be warranted before final selection. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">b. The investigation potential is of such high priority to the programthat the investigation should be developed for flight if at all possible.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">c. The investigative area is critical to the program and competitiveapproaches need to be developed further to allow selection of the optimumcourse. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">4. Based on evaluation of the above considerations associated withthe investigations requiring further development of hardware, the followinginformation should be provided to the Steering Committee and the ProgramAssociate Administrator responsible for selection: </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">a. The expected gain in potential return associated with the eventualincorporation of tentatively recommended investigations in the payload(s)or program. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">b. The expected costs required to develop instrumentation to the pointof ``demonstrated capability.'' </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">c. The risk involved in terms of added cost, probability of successfullydeveloping the required instrument capability, and the possibility of scheduleimpact. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">d. Identification of opportunities, if any, for inclusion of suchinvestigations in later missions. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">5. In those cases where investigations are tentatively selected, anexplicit statement should be made of the process to be followed in determiningthe final payload or program of investigations and the proposers so informed.The two-phase selection approach provides the opportunity for additionalassurance of development potential and probable cost prior to a full andfinal commitment to the investigation. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">6. As instruments used in investigations become increasingly complexand costly, the need for greater control of their development by the responsibleHeadquarters Program Office also grows. Accordingly, as an integral partof the evaluation process, a deliberate decision should be made regardingthe role of the Principal Investigator with respect to the provision ofthe major hardware associated with that person's investigation. The guidelinesfor the hardware acquisition determination are discussed in paragraph 501-lc.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">7. The range of options for responsibility for the instrumentationconsists of: </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">a. Assignment of full responsibility to the Principal Investigator.The responsibility includes all in-house or contracted activity to fabricate,test, calibrate and provide the instrumentation for integration. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">b. Retention of developmental responsibility by the Government withparticipation by the Principal Investigator in key events defined for theprogram. In all cases the right of the Principal Investigator to counseland recommend is paramount. Such involvement of the Principal Investigatormay include: </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(1) Provision of instrument specifications. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) Approval of instrument specifications. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(3) Independent monitorship of the development and advice to the Governmenton optimization of the instrumentation for conduct of the investigation.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(4) Participation in design reviews and all other appropriate reviews.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(5) Review and concurrence in changes resulting from design reviews.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(6) Participation in configuration control board actions. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(7) Advice in definition of test program. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(8) Review and approval of test program and changes thereto. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(9) Participation in conduct of the test program. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(10) Participation in calibration of instrument. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(11) Participation in final inspection and acceptance of the instrument.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(12) Participation in subsequent test and evaluation processes incidentto integration and flight preparation. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(13) Participation in the development and support of the operationsplan. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(14) Analysis and interpretation of data. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">8. Normally, the Principal Investigator should as a minimum: </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">a. Approve the instrument specification.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">b. Consult and advise the project manager in development and fabrication. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">c. Participate in final calibration of the instrument.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">d. Develop and support the operations plan.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">e. Analyze and interpret the data.    </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">9. The cognizant Project Installation is responsible for implementingthe program or project and should make recommendations concerning the appropriaterole for the Principal Investigators. The responsible Program AssociateAdministrator will determine the role, acting upon the advice of the responsibleHeadquarters Program Office and the Steering Committee. The Principal Investigator'sdesires will be respected in the negotiation of the person's role allowingan avenue of appeal to the Program Associate Administrator and, of course,the right to withdraw from participation.   </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">10. The Program Office responsible for the program should make a presentationto the Steering Committee with supporting documentation on the severaldecisions to be made by the responsible Program Associate Administrator.     </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">408 Steering Committee Review   </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1. The most important role of the Steering Committee is to providea substantive review of a potential payload or program of investigationsand to recommend a selection to the Program Associate Administrator. TheSteering Committee applies the collective experience and insight of representativesfrom the program and discipline communities and offers a forum for discussingthe logic of the selection from those points of view. In addition to thismission-specific evaluation function, the Steering Committee provides centralguidance to subcommittee chairpersons and serves as a clearinghouse forproblems and complaints regarding the evaluation and selection process.The Steering Committee is responsible for assuring adherence to requiredprocedures. Lastly, it is the forum where discipline objectives are weighedagainst program objectives and constraints.   </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. The Steering Committee represents the means for exercising threeresponsibilities in the process of selecting investigations to:   </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">a. Review compliance with procedures governing application of theinvestigation acquisition process.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">b. Ensure that adequate and appropriate documentation has been madeof the several steps in the evaluation process.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">c. Review the results of the evaluation by the subcommittee, Project,and Program Offices and prepare an assessment or endorsement of a recommendedpayload or program of investigations to the Program Associate Administrator. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">3. The purpose in exercising the first of these responsibilities isto ensure equity and consistency in the application of the process. Inthis sense, the Steering Committee is intended to provide the necessarychecks, balances, reviews, and coordination established through proceduresand controls inherent in conventional acquisition practices.   </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">4. The second and third responsibilities of the Steering Committeeare technical in nature. They require that the Steering Committee reviewthe evaluations by subcommittee, the Project Office, and the Program Officein terms of their completeness and appropriateness for forwarding to theProgram Associate Administrator. Most important in this review are:   </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">a. Degree to which results of evaluations and recommendations followlogically from the criteria contained in the Announcement.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">b. Consistency with objectives and policies generally beyond the scopeof affected Project/Program Offices.       </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">c. Sufficiency of reasons stated for tentative recommendations ofthose investigations requiring further instrument research and development. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">d. Sufficiency of reasons stated for determining responsibilitiesfor instrument development.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">e. Sufficiency of consideration of reusable space flight hardwareand support equipment for the recommended investigations.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">f. Sufficiency of reasons given for classifying proposed investigationsin their respective categories.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">g. Fair treatment of all proposals.   </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">5. The Steering Committee makes recommendations to the selection officialon the payload or program of investigations and notes caveats or provisionsimportant for consideration of the selection official.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">409 Principles to Apply   </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1. Paragraph 408 contains a description of the evaluation functionappropriate for a major payload or very significant program of investigation.The levels of review, evaluation, and refinement described should be appliedin those selections where warranted but could be varied for less significantselection situations. It is essential to consider the principles of theseveral evaluative steps, but it may not be essential to maintain  strictadherence to the sequence and structure of the evaluation system described.The selection official is responsible for determining the evaluation processmost appropriate for the selection situation using this Chapter as a guide.   </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. Significant deviations from the provisions of this Handbook mustbe fully documented and be approved by the Program Associate Administratorafter concurrence by the Office of General Counsel and Office of Procurement.    </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="74">Chapter 5_The Selection Process  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">500 General  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The Program Associate Administrator is responsible for the final decisionon those investigations to be selected for contract negotiation. This decisionculminates the several types of evaluations and processes that can be summarizedas follows:       </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="110"><C/> <H1>Evaluation stage</H1><H1>Principal emphasis</H1><H1>Results</H1>   <ITAG tagnum="1">Contractor (when authorized)<D>Summary evaluation (strengths and weaknesses) </D><D>Report to Subcommittee.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Subcommittee <D>Science and technological relevance, value, and feasibility </D><D>Categorization of individual proposals. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Project Office <D>Engineering/cost/integration/management assessment </D><D>Reports to Subcommittee and Program Office. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Program Office <D>Consistency with Announcement and program Objectives, and cost and scheduleconstraints</D><D>Recommendations to Steering Committee of payload or program of investigations.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Steering Committee<D>Logic of proposed selections compliance with proper procedures</D><D>Recommendations to Program Associate and Administrator.</D></ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">501 Decisions To Be Made  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1. The selection decisions by the Program Associate Administratorconstitute management judgments balancing individual and aggregate scientificor technological merit, the contribution of the recommended investigationsto the Announcement's objectives, and their consonance with budget constraints.In so doing, the selection official may develop such additional data tomake the following decisions:  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">a. Determination of the adequacy of scientific/technical analysissupporting the recommended selections. This supporting rationale shouldinvolve considerations including:  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(1) Assurance that the expected return contributes substantially toprogram objectives and is likely to be realized.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) Assurance that the evaluation criteria were applied consistentlyto all proposed investigations, thus ensuring that selection and rejectiondecisions are proper and fair.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(3) Assurance that the set of recommended investigations constitutesthe optimum program or payload considering potential value and constraints. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(4) Assurance that only one investigator is assigned as the PrincipalInvestigator to each investigation and that the Principal Investigatorwill assume the associated responsibilities and be the single point ofcontact and leader of any other investigators selected for the same investigation.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">b. Determination as to whether available returned space hardware orsupport equipment, with or without modification, would be adequate to meetor support investigation objectives.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">c. Determination as to whether the proposed instrument fabricatorqualifies and should be accepted as a sole source or whether the requirementshould be subjected to competitive solicitation. The following guidelinesapply:  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(1) The hardware requirement should be subjected to competitive solicitationin those instances where it is clear that the capability is not sufficientlyunique to justify sole source procurement.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) The hardware requirement should be purchased from the fabricatorproposed by the investigator, which may be the investigator's own institution,(a) when the fabricator's proposal contains technical data that are notavailable from another source, and it is not feasible or practicable todefine the fabrication requirement in such a way as to avoid the necessityof using the technical data contained in the proposal; (b) when the fabricatoroffers unique capabilities that are not available from another source;(c) when the selection official determines as part of the selection thatthe hardware of the particular fabricator contributes so significantlyto the value of the investigator's proposal as to be an integral part ofit.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(3) If a producer other than the one proposed by the investigatoroffers unique capabilities to produce the hardware requirement, NASA maybuy the hardware from the qualified fabricator.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(4) If a NASA employee submits a proposal as a principal investigator,any concomitant requirement for hardware necessary to perform the investigationmust, in accordance with CICA, either be completed by the installationprocurement office or, should it be determined that the hardware is sounique as to constitute a sole source, a justification must be written,synopsized, and approved in accordance with the requirements of FAR andthe NFS.       </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">d. Determination of the desirability for tentative selection of investigations.This determination involves considerations including:  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(1) Assessment of the state of development of the investigative hardware,the cost and schedule for development in relation to the gain in potentialbenefits at the time of final selection.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) Assurance that there is adequate definition of investigation hardwareto allow parallel design of other project hardware.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(3) Assurance that appropriate management procedures are containedin the project plan for reevaluation and final selection (or rejection)on an appropriate time scale.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">e. Determination of the acceptability of the proposer's managementplan, including the proposed hardware development plan, and the necessity,if any, of negotiating modifications to that plan.   </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. In the process of making the above determinations described insubparagraph 1, the Program Associate Administrator may request additionalinformation or evaluations. In most instances, this information can beprovided by the Program Office responsible for the mission, project, orprogram. However, where it is determined appropriate, the Program AssociateAdministrator may reconvene the subcommittee or poll the members individuallyor provide for additional analysis or require additional data from evaluatorsor proposers as considered necessary to facilitate the Program AssociateAdministrator's decision.    </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">502 The Selection Statement   </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Upon completion of deliberations, the responsible Program AssociateAdministrator shall issue a selection statement. Ordinarily this statementwill, upon request, be releasable to the public. As a minimum, the selectionstatement should include:   </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1. The general and specific evaluation criteria and relative importanceused for the selection.   </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. The categorizations provided by the subcommittee and the basicrationale for accepting or not accepting each Category I proposal and asuccinct statement concerning the nonacceptance of all other proposals.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">3. A concise description of each investigation accepted includingan indication as to whether the selection is a partial acceptance of aproposal and/or a joinder with other investigators.        </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">4. The role of the Principal Investigator with regard to hardwareessential to the investigation and whether the Principal Investigator willbe responsible for hardware acquisition and the basis therefor.   </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">5. An indication of the plan and acquisition using the regular procurementprocesses, if the Principal Investigator is not to acquire the hardware.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">6. A statement indicating whether the selection is final or tentative,recognizing the need for better definition of the investigation and itscost.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">7. A statement indicating any use of Government-owned available spaceflight hardware and/or support equipment. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">503 Notification of Proposers</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1. It is essential that investigators whose proposals are determinedto have no reasonable chance for selection be apprised of that fact assoon as practicable. To this end, the responsible Program Office will,upon such determination, promptly notify investigators of that fact togetherwith an exposition of the major reason(s) why the proposals were so considered.The notification letter should also inform such investigators that theymay obtain a detailed oral debriefing provided they request it in writing.The letter should point out that such a debriefing would be available onlyafter completion of the selection process and would otherwise be conductedin accordance with NASA regulations (NASA FAR Supplement). (See paragraph504.)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. As a result of the selection decisions made by the Program AssociateAdministrator, letters of notification will be sent to those PrincipalInvestigators selected to participate. This notification letter shouldnot commit the agency to more than negotiations for the selected investigationleading to a contract, but it should clearly indicate the decision madeand contain:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">a. A concise description of the Principal Investigator's investigationas selected, specifically noting substantive changes, if any, from theinvestigation originally proposed by the Principal Investigator.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">b. The nature of the selection, i.e., whether it should be consideredfinal or tentative requiring additional hardware or cost definition.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">c. A description of the anticipated role of the Principal Investigatorincluding the responsibility for the provision of instruments for flightexperiments.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">d. Identification of the principal technical and management pointsto be treated in subsequent negotiations.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">e. Any rights to be granted on use of data, publishing of data, andduration of use of the data.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">f. Where applicable, indication that a foreign selectee's participationin the program will be arranged between the International Affairs Division,Office of External Relations, and the foreign government agency which endorsedthe proposal.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">3. In conjunction with the notification of successful foreign proposers,the Program Office shall forward a letter to the responsible InternationalAffairs Division, Office of External Relations, addressing the following:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">a. The overall scientific technological objective of the planned effort.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">b. The period of time during which the effort is planned.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">c. The respective responsibilities of NASA and of the sponsoring (endorsing)governmental agency; these may include:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(1) Provision and subsequent disposition of hardware and software.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) Responsibilities for reporting, reduction and dissemination ofdata.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(3) Responsibilities for transportation of hardware.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">d. Any additional information pertinent to the successful conductof the experiment.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">4. Using the information provided in subparagraph 3, the InternationalAffairs Division, Office of External Relations will prepare and negotiatean agreement with the sponsoring foreign agency.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">5. Notices shall also be sent to those proposers not previously notifiedpursuant to the preceding paragraphs, and, as applicable, a copy to thesponsoring foreign government agency. It is important that these remainingproposers be informed at the same time as those selected. Other agencynotifications and press release procedures will apply, as appropriate.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">504 Debriefing</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">It is the policy of the National Aeronautics and Space Administrationto debrief, if requested, unsuccessful proposers of investigations in accordancewith NFS 1815.1003. The following considerations are offered in arrangingand conducting debriefings:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1. Debriefing should be carried out by an official designated by theresponsible Program Associate Administrator. Any other personnel receivingrequests for information concerning the rejection of a proposal shouldrefer to the designated official.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. Debriefing of unsuccessful offerors should be made at the earliestpossible time; debriefing will generally be scheduled subsequent to selectionbut prior to award of contracts to the successful proposers.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">3. Material discussed in debriefing should be factual and wholly consonantwith the documented findings of several stages of the evaluation processand the selection statement.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">4. The debriefing official should advise of weak or deficient areasin the proposal, indicate whether those weaknesses were factors in theselection, and advise of the major considerations in selecting the competingsuccessful proposer where appropriate.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">5. The debriefing official should not discuss other unsuccessful proposals,ranking, votes of members, or attempt to make a point-by-point comparisonwith successful proposals.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">6. A memorandum of record of the debriefing should be provided theChairperson of the Steering Committee.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="74">Chapter 6_Payload Formulation</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">600 Payload Formulation</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1. Payload elements for Space Transportation System (STS) missionscan come from many sources. These include those selected through Announcementsof Opportunity, those generated by in-house research and funded throughthe Research and Technology Operations and Plans (RTOP) procedures, unsolicited(domestic and foreign) proposals and those derived from agreements betweenNASA and external entities. Missions may have payload elements originatingfrom any or all of these sources. However, it is anticipated that the primarysource of NASA payload elements will be the Announcement process. Generally,proposals for payload elements submitted outside the Announcement processwill not be selected if they would have been responsive to a stated Announcementobjective. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. Payload elements for STS flights fall into two major categories.``NASA or NASA-related'' payload elements are those which are developedby a NASA Program Office or by another party with which NASA has a sharedinterest. ``Non-NASA'' payload elements are those which require only STSoperation services from NASA and hence interface with NASA through theOffice of Space Flight.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">3. In general, a Program Office will be designated to be responsiblefor formulating the ``NASA or NASA-related'' portion of an STS payload.The Office of Space Flight will be responsible for formulating the ``non-NASA''portion of an STS payload. Flights may, of course, consist wholly of payloadelements of either type defined in subparagraphs 1 and 2. Resource allocationfor mixed missions will be determined jointly by the designated ProgramOffice and the Office of Space Flight.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="74">Chapter 7_Procurement and Other Considerations </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">700 Early Involvement Essential</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1. The distinctive feature of the Announcement of Opportunity processis that it is both a program planning system and a procurement system inone single procedure. The choice of what aeronautical and space phenomenato investigate is program planning. Procurement is involved with the purchaseof property and services to carry out the selected investigations. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. Because of both the programmatic and multi-functional aspects ofthe Announcement of Opportunity process, early involvement of externalprogram office elements is essential. Success of the process requires thatit proceed in a manner that meets program goals and is clearly in linewith statutory requirements and sound procurement policy.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">3. The planning preparation and selection schedule for the investigationshould commence early enough to meet the present statutory and regulatoryrequirements. Chief of these are the requirements for soliciting maximumfeasible competition and for conducting discussions with offerors withinthe competitive range by the Project Office and/or any other evaluationgroup or office authorized by the selection official.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">701 Negotiation, Discussions, and Contract Award </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Indicated below are some of the major procurement procedures thatneed to be accomplished or performed to assure uniformity and sufficiencyin the acquisition of investigations. These areas are not exclusive andnot intended to substitute for adequate coordination and good judgmentbefore issuance of the Announcement, during evaluation of proposals, andprior to contract award.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1. As negotiated procurements must be made by soliciting proposalsfrom the maximum number of qualified sources consistent with the requirement,the Announcement of Opportunity must also be synopsized in the CommerceBusiness Daily. Responses to the synopsis must be added to the Announcementmailing list. Every effort should be made to publish opportunities farenough in advance to encourage a broad response. (In no case less than45 days before the date set for receipt of proposals).  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. Significant items for consideration after receipt of proposals: </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">a. <T3>Late Proposals. </T3>The NASA policy on late proposals contained inthe NASA FAR Supplement (NFS 1815.412) is applicable to proposals receivedin response to an Announcement of Opportunity. Potential investigatorsshould be informed of this policy. In the Announcement of Opportunity context,the selection official or designee will determine whether a late proposalwill be considered. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">b. <T3>Competitive Considerations. </T3>(1) The acquisition of investigationsinvolves the solicitation of unique, novel, and unspecified ideas to meetNASA's aeronautical and space responsibilities. The proposals submittedin response to these solicitations are not necessarily fully comparable.Rather these are discrete, novel scientific and technical investigativeideas associated with a limited opportunity. Although not necessarily fullycomparable, all proposals within the scope of a specified opportunity mustnevertheless be evaluated in accordance with the criteria stated in theAnnouncement. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) Cost must be considered in the evaluation if costs are involvedin the investigation. Accordingly, general cost information should be givento the subcommittee by the Installation Project Office for use in determiningthe categories into which the subcommittee places proposals. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(3) Further information should be obtained, as necessary, by the InstallationProject Office and/or any other evaluation group or office authorized bythe selection official and from the investigators whose proposals are stillbeing considered. This would be similar to the regular procurement procedurefor conducting written and oral discussions. A major consideration duringdiscussions is to avoid unfairness and unequal treatment. Obviously, goodjudgment is required by all concerned in the extent and content of thediscussions. There should be no reluctance in obtaining the advice andguidance of management and staff offices during the discussion phase. Asummary should be prepared of the primary points covered in the writtenand oral discussions and show the effect of the discussions on the evaluationof proposals.

This process is not intended to conflictwith any established statutory requirements. The FAR, the NFS, and relatedprocurement directives should be referred to for guidance and clarificationin those instances where specific instructions are not contained in thisHandbook.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">703 Other Administrative and Functional Requirements </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">After selection, all other applicable administrative and functionalrequirements will be complied with or incorporated in any resultant contract.These may include requirements contained in such publications as NHB 5300.4(1B),``Quality Program Provisions for Aeronautical and Space System Contractors,''and NHB 9501.2, ``Procedures for Contractor Reporting of Correlated Costand Performance Data.'' </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="74">Appendix A to Appendix I of 1870.103_ Format of Announcement of Opportunity(AO) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="71">OMB Approval Number 2700-0042 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="71">National Aeronautics and Space Administration, Washington, DC 20546</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="71">Announcement of Opportunity </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="77">AO No. _</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="71">(Issuance Date) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="71">(DESCRIPTIVE HEADING) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">I. Description of the Opportunity </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">This section should set forth the basic purpose of the Announcementand describe the opportunity in terms of NASA's desire to obtain proposalswhich will meet the stated scientific, applications and/or technologicalobjectives. These objectives may be directed to the generation of proposalsfor investigations and/or they may pertain to the acquisition of dissimilarideas leading to selection of investigators, guest observers, guest investigators,or theorists; and/or any other approved area as identified in NHB 8030.6.In those instances wherein proposals for investigations are sought, thissection should describe the requirement, if any, for selected investigatorsto serve on advisory or working groups. In those instances where the projector program has not yet been approved, an appropriate qualifying statementshould be included to clearly indicate that this Announcement of Opportunitydoes not constitute an obligation on the part of the Government to carrythe proposed effort to completion. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">II. Announcement Objectives </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">This section will give a succinct statement of the specific scientific,applications, and/or technological objective(s) for the opportunity(s)for which proposals are sought. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">III. Background </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">This section should provide an explanation of the context of the opportunity,i.e., information which will help the reader to understand the relevanceof the opportunity in relation to broader objectives. For example, if theopportunity is related to a specific mission, this section should so indicateand provide information regarding the mission objectives. If, on the otherhand, the opportunity is not related to a specific mission (for example,where the opportunity is discipline-oriented), this section should reflectthat fact and provide information which will give the reader insight intothe circumstances which have given rise to the opportunity and its relevanceto the general scheme of things. Information on prior studies and theiravailability should, if relevant to an understanding of the opportunity,be disclosed here. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">IV. Proposal Opportunity Period </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">This section should inform the reader of the proposal opportunityperiod(s). The following methods may be utilized individually or in conjunctionfor establishing the proposal opportunity period(s): </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1. The Announcement may be issued establishing a single date by whichproposals may be received. However, the Announcement could provide thatthe agency may amend the AO to provide for subsequent dates for submissionof proposals, if additional investigations are desired. In this case, theinitiative to reopen is an agency management determination and if sufficientinvestigations were selected for the Announcement objectives or flightpossibilities, subsequent opportunities for proposal submission by potentialinvestigators would not be available. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. The Announcement may be issued to provide for an initial submissiondate with the AO to remain open for submission of additional proposalsup to a final cutoff date. This final date should be related to the availabilityof resources necessary to evaluate the continuous flow of proposals andthe time remaining prior to the flight opportunities contemplated by theAnnouncement. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">3. The Announcement may be issued establishing a number of dates bywhich proposals may be received. Normally no more than three proposal submissiondates should be established. The submittal dates may be spread over thenumber of months most compatible with the possible flight opportunitiesand the availability of resources necessary to evaluate and fund the proposal.If desired, this section should further inform the reader that if a proposalreceives a Category I, II, or III rating but is not selected for immediatesupport, the proposal may, if desired by the proposer, be held by NASAfor later consideration within the ground rules set forth in paragraphsl and 2. The section should inform the reader that if the person wishesthe proposal to be so treated, it should be indicated in the proposal.This section should further indicate that offerors whose proposals areto be considered at a later time will be given the opportunity to revalidatetheir proposals with their institution and update cost data. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">V. Requirements and Constraints </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1.

Foreword </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">a. NASA depends upon industry, educational institutions and othernonprofit organizations for most of its research efforts. While a numberof mechanisms have been developed over the years to inform the researchcommunity of those areas in which NASA has special research interests,these instructions apply only to ``NASA Research Announcements,'' a formof ``broad agency announcement'' described in 6.102(d)(2) and 35.016 ofthe Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR). The ``NASA Research Announcement(NRA)'' permits competitive selection of research projects in accordancewith statute while at the same time preserving the traditional conceptsand understandings associated with NASA sponsorship of research.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">b. These instructions are Appendix I to 1870.203 of the NASA FederalAcquisition Regulation Supplement.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">2. Policy </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">a. NASA fosters and encourages the submission of research proposalsrelevant to agency mission requirements by solicitations, ``NASA ResearchAnnouncements,'' which describe research areas of interest to NASA. Proposalsreceived in response to an NRA will be used only for evaluation purposes. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">b. NASA does not allow a proposal, the contents of which are not availablewithout restriction from another source, or any unique ideas submittedin response to an NRA to be used as the basis of a solicitation or in negotiationwith other organizations, nor is a pre-award synopsis published for individualproposals.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">c. A solicited proposal that results in a NASA award becomes partof the record of that transaction and may be available to the public onspecific request; however, information or material that NASA and the awardeemutually agree to be of a privileged nature will be held in confidenceto the extent permitted by law, including the Freedom of Information Act. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">3. Purpose </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">These instructions are intended to supplement documents identifiedas ``NASA Research Announcements.'' The NRAs contain programmatic informationand certain ``NRA-specific'' requirements which apply only to proposalsprepared in response to that particular announcement. These instructionscontain the general proposal preparation information which applies to responsesto all NRAs.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">4. Relationship to Award  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">a. A contract, grant, cooperative agreement, or other agreement maybe used to accomplish an effort funded on the basis of a proposal submittedin response to an NRA. NASA does not have separate ``grant proposal'' and``contract proposal'' categories, so all proposals may be prepared in asimilar fashion. NASA will determine the appropriate instrument.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">b. Grants are generally used to fund basic research in educationaland nonprofit institutions, while research in other private sector organizationsis accomplished under contract. Additional information peculiar to thecontractual process (certifications, cost and pricing data, facilitiesinformation, etc.) will be requested, as necessary, as the procurementprogresses. Contracts resulting from NRAs are subject to the Federal AcquisitionRegulation and the NASA FAR Supplement (NHB 5100.4). Any resultant grantsor cooperative agreements will be awarded and administered in accordancewith the NASA Grant and Cooperative Agreement Handbook (NHB 5800.1). </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">5. Conformance to Guidance </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">a. NASA does not have any mandatory forms or formats for preparationof responses to NRAs; however, it is requested that proposals conform tothe procedural and submission guidelines covered in these instructions.In particular, NASA may accept proposals without discussion; hence, proposalsshould initially be as complete as possible and be submitted on the proposers'most favorable terms.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">b. In order to be considered responsive to the solicitation, a submissionmust, at a minimum, present a specific project within the areas delineatedby the NRA; contain sufficient technical and cost information to permita meaningful evaluation; be signed by an official authorized to legallybind the submitting organization; not merely offer to perform standardservices or to just provide computer facilities or services; and not significantlyduplicate a more specific current or pending NASA solicitation. NASA reservesthe right to reject any or all proposals received in response to an NRAwhen such action is considered in the best interest of the Government.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">6. NRA-Specific Items  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">a. Several proposal submission items will appear in the NRA itself.These include: the unique NRA identifier; when to submit proposals; whereto send proposals; number of copies required; and sources for more information.    </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">b. Items included in these instructions may be supplemented by theNRA, as circumstances warrant. Examples are: technical points for specialemphasis; additional evaluation factors; and proposal length.   </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">7. Proposal Contents  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">a. The following general information is needed in all proposals inorder to permit consideration in an objective manner. NRAs will generallyspecify topics for which additional information or greater detail is desirable.Each proposal copy shall contain all submitted material, including a copyof the transmittal letter if it contains substantive information.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">b. Transmittal Letter or Prefatory Material   </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(1) The legal name and address of the organization and specific divisionor campus identification if part of a larger organization;  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) A brief, scientifically valid project title intelligible to ascientifically literate reader and suitable for use in the public press;  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(3) Type of organization: e.g., profit, nonprofit, educational, smallbusiness, minority, women-owned, etc.;   </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(4) Name and telephone number of the principal investigator and businesspersonnel who may be contacted during evaluation or negotiation;   </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(5) Identification of any other organizations that are currently evaluatinga proposal for the same efforts;   </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(6) Identification of the specific NRA, by number and title, to whichthe proposal is responding;   </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(7) Dollar amount requested of NASA, desired starting date, and durationof project;   </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(8) Date of submission; and   </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(9) Signature of a responsible official or authorized representativeof the organization, or any other person authorized to legally bind theorganization (unless the signature appears on the proposal itself).  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">c. Restriction on Use and Disclosure of Proposal Information  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">It is NASA policy to use information contained in proposals for evaluationpurposes only. While this policy does not require that the proposal beara restrictive notice, offerors or quoters      should, in order to maximizeprotection of trade secrets or other information that is commercial orfinancial and confidential or privileged, place the following notice onthe title page of the proposal and specify the information subject to thenotice by inserting appropriate identification, such as page numbers, inthe notice. In any event, information (data) contained in proposals willbe protected to the extent permitted by law, but NASA assumes no liabilityfor use and disclosure of information not made subject to the notice.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="71">Notice   </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Restriction on Use and Disclosure  of Proposal Information.</T3>Theinformation (data) contained in [<T3>insert page numbers or other identification</T3>] of this proposalconstitutes a trade secret and/or information that is commercial or financialand confidential or privileged. It is furnished to the Government in confidencewith the understanding that it will not, without permission of the offeror,be used or disclosed other than for evaluation purposes; provided, however,that in the event a contract (or other agreement) is awarded on the basisof this proposal the Government shall have the right to use and disclosethis information (data) to the extent provided in the contract (or otheragreement). This restriction does not limit the Government's right to useor disclose this information (data) if obtained from another source withoutrestriction.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">d. Abstract  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Include a concise (200-300 word if not otherwise specified in theNRA) abstract describing the objective of the proposed effort and the methodof approach.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">e.

The project description shouldbe prepared in a manner that addresses the evaluation factors in theseinstructions and any additional specific factors in the NRA. Any substantialcollaboration with individuals not referred to in the budget or use ofconsultants should be described. Note, however, that subcontracting significantportions of a research project is discouraged. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) When it is expected that the effort will require more than oneyear for completion, the proposal should cover the complete project tothe extent that it can be reasonably anticipated. Principal emphasis should,of course, be on the first year of work, and the description should distinguishclearly between the first year's work and work planned for subsequent years. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">f. Management Approach  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">For large or complex efforts involving interactions among numerousindividuals or other organizations, plans for distribution of responsibilitiesand any necessary arrangements for ensuring a coordinated effort shouldbe described.

Personnel  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The principal investigator is responsible for direct supervision ofthe work and participates in the conduct of the research regardless ofwhether or not compensation is received under the award. A short biographicalsketch of the principal investigator, a list of principal publicationsand any exceptional qualifications should be included. Omit social securitynumber and other personal items which do not merit consideration in evaluationof the proposal. Give similar biographical information on other seniorprofessional personnel who will be directly associated with the project.Give the names and titles of any other scientists and technical personnelassociated substantially with the project in an advisory capacity. Universitiesshould list the approximate number of students or other assistants, togetherwith information as to their level of academic attainment.

Identify any Government-owned facilities, industrialplant equipment, or special tooling that are proposed for use on the project. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) Before requesting a major item of capital equipment, the proposershould determine if sharing or loan of equipment already within the organizationis a feasible alternative to purchase. Where such arrangements cannot bemade, the proposal should so state. The need for items that typically canbe used for both research and non-research purposes should be explained. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">i. Proposed Costs   </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(1) Proposals should contain cost and technical parts in one volume:do not use separate ``confidential'' salary pages. As applicable, includeseparate cost estimates for salaries and wages; fringe benefits; equipment;expendable materials and supplies; services; domestic and foreign travel;ADP expenses; publication or page charges; consultants; subcontracts; othermiscellaneous identifiable direct costs; and indirect costs.

Renewal Proposals</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">a. Renewal proposals for existing awards will be considered in thesame manner as proposals for new endeavors. It is not necessary that arenewal proposal repeat all of the information that was in the originalproposal upon which the current support was based. The renewal proposalshould refer to its predecessor, update the parts that are no longer current,and indicate what elements of the research are expected to be covered duringthe period for which extended support is desired. A description of anysignificant findings since the most recent progress report should be included.The renewal proposal should treat, in reasonable detail, the plans forthe next period, contain a cost estimate, and otherwise adhere to theseinstructions.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">b. NASA reserves the right to renew an effort either through amendmentof an existing contract or by a new award.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">9. Length</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Unless otherwise specified in the NRA, every effort should be madeto keep proposals as brief as possible, concentrating on substantive materialessential for a complete understanding of the project. Experience showsthat few proposals need exceed 15-20 pages. Any necessary detailed information,such as reprints, should be included as attachments rather than in themain body of the proposal. A complete set of attachments is necessary foreach copy of the proposal. As proposals are not returned, avoid use of``one-of-a-kind'' attachments: their availability may be mentioned in theproposal.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">10. Joint Proposals</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">a. Some projects involve joint efforts among individuals in differentorganizations or mutual efforts of more than one organization. Where multipleorganizations are involved, the proposal may be submitted by only one ofthem. In this event, it should clearly describe the role to be played bythe other organizations and indicate the legal and managerial arrangementscontemplated. In other instances, simultaneous submission of related proposalsfrom each organization might be appropriate, in which case parallel awardswould be made.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">b. Where a project of a cooperative nature with NASA is contemplated,the proposal should describe the contributions expected from any participatingNASA investigator and agency facilities or equipment which may be required.However, the proposal must be confined only to that which the proposingorganization can commit itself. ``Joint'' proposals which purport to specifythe internal arrangements NASA will actually make are not acceptable asa means of establishing an agency commitment.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">11. Late Proposals</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">A proposal or modification thereto received after the date or datesspecified in an NRA may still be considered if the selecting official deemsit to offer NASA a significant technical advantage or cost reduction.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">12. Withdrawal</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Proposals may be withdrawn by the proposer at any time. Offerors arerequested to notify NASA if the proposal is funded by another organizationor of other changed circumstances which dictate termination of evaluation.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">13. Evaluation Factors</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">a. Unless otherwise specified in the NRA, the principal elements (ofapproximately equal weight) considered in evaluating a proposal are itsrelevance to NASA's objectives, intrinsic merit, and cost.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">b. Evaluation of a proposal's relevance to NASA's objectives includesthe consideration of the potential contribution of the effort to NASA'smission.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">c. Evaluation of its intrinsic merit includes the consideration ofthe following factors, none of which is more important than any other:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(1) Overall scientific or technical merit of the proposal or uniqueand innovative methods, approaches, or concepts demonstrated by the proposal.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) The offeror's capabilities, related experience, facilities, techniques,or unique combinations of these which are integral factors for achievingthe proposal objectives.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(3) The qualifications, capabilities, and experience of the proposedprincipal investigator, team leader, or key personnel who are criticalin achieving the proposal objectives.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(4) Overall standing among similar proposals available for evaluationand/or evaluation against the known state-of-the-art.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">d. Evaluation of the cost of a proposed effort includes the considerationof the realism and reasonableness of the proposed cost and the relationshipof the proposed cost to available funds.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">14. Evaluation Techniques</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Selection decisions will be made following peer and/or scientificreview of the proposals. Several evaluation techniques are regularly usedwithin NASA. In all cases, however, proposals are subject to scientificreview by discipline specialists in the area of the proposal. Some proposalsare reviewed entirely in-house where NASA has particular competence; othersare evaluated by a combination of in-house people and selected externalreviewers, while yet others are subject to the full external peer reviewtechnique (with due regard for conflict-of-interest and protection of proposalinformation), such as by mail or through assembled panels. Regardless ofthe technique, the final decisions are always made by a designated NASAselecting official. A proposal which is scientifically and programmaticallymeritorious, but which is not selected for award during its initial reviewunder the NRA may be included in subsequent reviews unless the proposerrequests otherwise.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">15. Selection for Award</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">a. When a proposal is not selected for award, and the proposer hasindicated that the proposal is not to be held over for subsequent reviews,the proposer will be notified that the proposal was not selected for award.NASA will notify the proposer and explain generally why the proposal wasnot selected. Proposers desiring additional information may contact theselecting official who will arrange a debriefing.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">b. When a proposal is selected for award, negotiation and award willbe handled by the procurement office in the funding installation. The proposalis used as the basis for negotiation with the submitter. Formal RFPs arenot used to obtain additional information on a proposal selected underthe NRA process. However, the contracting officer may request certain businessdata and may forward a model contract and other information which willbe of use during the contract negotiation.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">16. Cancellation of NRA</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">NASA reserves the right to make no awards under this NRA and, in theabsence of program funding or for any other reason, to cancel this NRAby having a notice published in the ``Commerce Business Daily.'' NASA assumesno liability for cancelling the NRA or for anyone's failure to receiveactual notice of cancellation. Cancellation may be followed by issuanceand synopsis of a revised NRA, since amendment of an NRA is normally notpermitted.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="52">Subpart 1870.3_NASA Source Evaluation</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="80">1870.301</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89"> Purpose. </ITAG>The acquisition of goods and services is among the most important activitiesthat NASA performs and demands the agency's best management efforts.

While in general the SEB Chairperson, SEB members, and committeemembers are drawn from the cognizant installation, personnel from otherNASA installations or other Government agencies may be used when theirservices are required in a particular area of expertise and would significantlycontribute to the evaluation of proposals.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">c. It is NASA policy to have proposals evaluated by the most competenttechnical and management sources available in NASA and the Jet PropulsionLaboratory (JPL). All personnel participating in evaluation proceedingsshall be instructed to observe the restrictions in the FAR and NFS regardingpersonal conflicts of interest and the disclosure of information concerningthe evaluation. Non-NASA personnel shall not serve as voting members ofa NASA SEB.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">d. In evaluating a proposal, the SEB may find that it is necessaryto disclose the proposal (in whole or in part) outside the Government tomeet its evaluation needs. When it is clearly necessary to disclose theproposal (in whole or in part) outside the Government, arrangements shallbe made in accordance with NFS 1815.413-2.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">e. It is desirable that voting members of the SEB include people whowill have key assignments on the project to which the procurement is directed.However, it is important that this should be tempered to ensure objectivityand to avoid an improper balance. It may even be appropriate to designatea management official from outside the project as SEB Chairperson.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">f. SEB membership normally need not exceed seven voting members, includingthe Chairperson. If additional support is needed, the use of committeesand panels is authorized. The number of such supporting personnel shallbe kept as small as the nature of the subject matter permits.

Where this is not feasible, SEB membership and dutiesare to take precedence over other duties.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">g. The number of nonvoting ex officio (advisory) members shall bekept as small as the nature of the procurement allows. Ex officio membersshould be selected for the experience and expertise they can provide tothe SEB. Since their advisory role may require access to highly sensitiveSEB material and findings, ex officio membership for persons other thanthose identified in paragraph 3b should be carefully considered. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="71">2.

This can range from the simplest situation, wherethe SEB conducts the evaluation and fact-finding without the use of committeesor panels, to a highly complex situation involving a major acquisitionwhere two or more committees are formed and these, in turn, are assistedby special panels in particular areas. Appropriate organization somewherebetween these two extremes is generally expected but in all cases the numberof committees or panels should be kept to a minimum consistent with therequirements of the procurement.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">203 Responsibilities</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1. The SEB is the central group in the source evaluation process.Its function is to carry out the activities set forth in this handbook,culminating in final evaluation of all proposals and its report to theSSO. The SEB's evaluation is based on all available information, includingproposals, committee and panel reports, written and/or oral discussions,personal knowledge of the members in the area of experience and past performance,and other appropriate reference checks. Subject to reviews by the SSO andcognizant management personnel as may be required, the SEB establishesevaluation factors, subfactors, elements and their relative importance;generates qualification standards (where applicable); and reviews and approvesthe RFP prior to issuance. The SEB reviews offeror satisfaction of applicablequalification standards, if any, and makes an identification of unacceptableproposals. It provides an initial evaluation of acceptable proposals sufficientfor determination of the competitive range and participates in writtenand/or oral discussions held with all offerors in the competitive range.The SEB shall not delegate its evaluation responsibility in whole or inpart. Findings of committees or panels must be reviewed by the SEB, withits own collective judgment being applied in arriving at the SEB evaluationfindings reported to the SSO.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. The SEB Chairperson is the principal operating executive of theSEB. This carries with it a responsibility broader in scope and includingmore requirements for coordination across more different specialized disciplinesand through more diverse management channels than is expected in most managementsituations. The Chairperson is expected to manage the team efficientlywithout compromising the validity of the findings provided to the SSO asthe basis for a sound selection decision.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">3. The SEB Recorder functions as the principal administrative assistantto the SEB Chairperson. The duties and responsibilities of the positionare as follows:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">a.

At the conclusion of all SEB activity, surveys the area where SEBactivity occurred and arranges for the return of equipment and materials,as appropriate. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">4. An SEB Committee functions as a fact-finding arm of the SEB, usuallyin a broad grouping of related disciplines (e.g., technical or management).It is comprised of people well-versed and experienced in each of the majordisciplines under its aegis. For example, a ``Management Committee'' couldinclude experts in such areas as organization, pricing, personnel, labor,contracting, and facilities operation. The committee examines in detaileach proposal, or portion thereof, assigned by the SEB. It evaluates suchproposals or excerpts in accordance with the approved evaluation factors,subfactors, and elements and submits a written report to the SEB summarizingits evaluation. The committee will also respond to requirements assignedby the SEB, including further justification or reconsideration of its findings.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">5. Committee chairpersons shall, with respect to their committees,exercise the same responsibility for administrative and procedural mattersas does the SEB Chairperson for the SEB. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">6. An SEB panel functions as a fact-finding arm of the committee ina specialized area of the committee's responsibilities. Panels are establishedwhen a particular area requires deeper analysis than can be provided byindividual members of the committee. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">7. a. All personnel involved in SEB activities are responsible forcomplying with the requirements of this handbook and other applicable regulations.Accordingly, they are advised to seek counsel and guidance from appropriatepersonnel, such as; the SEB Chairperson, the SEB procurement voting member,the contracting officer and/or the SEB legal advisor as well as any cognizantinstallation SEB advisory group with respect to any questions concerningcompliance with these requirements. The Chairperson shall require eachSEB, committee, and panel member to be familiar with the provisions ofNHB 1900.1, ``Standards of Conduct for NASA Employees,'' regarding conflictof interest and to inform the Chairperson in writing if, in the opinionof the member, their participation presents a real or apparent conflictof interest. In addition, the SEB Chairperson shall ensure that each SEB,committee, and panel member has filed a completed NASA Form 1270, ``ConfidentialStatement of Employment and Financial Interests.'' Code HS procurementanalysts will comply with the necessary disclosure requirements and willsign the necessary certificates on an annual basis to cover all SEB activitiesthat the analyst may participate in throughout the year. Completed NASAForm 1270's from Code HS personnel will be generated and reviewed at theHeadquarters level and will remain on file in the Office of General Counsel.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"> b. Prior to selection and announcement of an offeror for final negotiations,NASA personnel shall not reveal any information concerning the evaluationto anyone not participating in the same evaluation proceedings and thenonly to the extent such information is required by such proceedings andapproved by the SSO or designee. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">c. Subsequent to selection and announcement of an offeror for finalnegotiations, information concerning SEB proceedings and data will be madeavailable to others within NASA only when the requester demonstrates aneed to know for a NASA purpose. Information will be made available topersons outside NASA, including other Government agencies, only when suchdisclosure is concurred in by the Office of General Counsel. Title 18,U.S. Code, Section 1905, prohibits any officer or employee of the UnitedStates from disclosing or divulging certain kinds of business confidentialand trade secret information unless authorized by law. Possible penaltiesupon conviction include imprisonment of up to 1 year, a fine of not morethan $1,000, and removal from the Federal Service. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="74">Chapter 3_Evaluation Factors, Subfactors and Elements </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">300 General</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1. This Chapter describes the factors, subfactors, and elements usedin evaluation of proposals and discusses the manner in which the SEB willdevelop, describe, and structure such factors, subfactors, and elements.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. The SEB's responsibility is to provide analysis of proposals toaid the SSO in selecting the offeror(s) who best meets the Government'srequirements at a reasonable cost. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">3. In making a selection, the SSO normally considers four evaluationfactors: a. Mission Suitability (which reflects how well the offerors canbe expected to perform the work from a technical and management perspective);b. Cost (which reflects what it will probably cost the Government to dobusiness with the offerors); c. Relevant Experience and Past Performance(which reflects the amount and quality of previous work accomplished bythe offerors comparable to the work to be performed under the procurementbeing evaluated); and d. Other Considerations (which are those considerations,stated in the RFP, other than Mission Suitability, Cost, and Relevant Experienceand Past Performance that can affect contract performance). </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">4. Performing the proposed work properly (Mission Suitability) isalways important, and so is the probable cost of performing that work.Probable cost is not necessarily the offeror's estimate of costs; rather,it is the SEB's assessment of what the proposed work is likely to cost.Depending on circumstances, relevant experience and past performance orother considerations may or may not be of prime importance. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">5. The SEB evaluates proposals with respect to the four evaluationfactors, as follows: </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">a. <T3>Mission Suitability. </T3>This factor indicates, for each offeror,the merit or excellence of the work to be performed or product to be delivered.It includes, as appropriate, both technical and management subfactors.Because this factor can be highly technical and must be integrated in orderto convey an overall evaluation of relative merit, Mission Suitabilityand its supporting subfactors shall be numerically weighted and scored.Elements may or may not be numerically weighted and scored. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">b. <T3>Cost. </T3>This factor evaluates what each offeror's proposal willprobably cost the Government should it be selected for negotiations leadingto award. Proposed costs are analyzed to determine the probable ``costof doing business'' based upon the offeror's proposed approach. Further,this analysis identifies and assesses the impact of features that causea proposal to cost more or less than other proposals. (See paragraph 302for detailed coverage.) Cost is not numerically weighted or scored. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">c. <T3>Relevant Experience and Past Performance. </T3>This factor indicatesthe relevant quantitative and qualitative aspects of each offeror's recordof performing services or delivering products similar in size, content,and complexity to the requirements of the instant procurement. The RelevantExperience and Past Performance factor provides an opportunity to evaluatethe quality of goods and services provided by the offeror(s) to the agencyand other Government organizations. The agency has acquired a substantialamount of firsthand experience and past performance data over a varietyof program and contract efforts. Evaluation of this factor also utilizesrelevant experience and past performance data from programs acquired byother Governmental organizations, covering both prime and subcontractorperformance. The Relevant Experience and Past Performance factor is notnumerically weighted or scored. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">d. <T3>Other Considerations. </T3>This factor includes those considerationsother than Mission Suitability, Cost, and Relevant Experience and PastPerformance. They include, but are not limited to, such items as: financialcondition, labor relations considerations, small and small disadvantagedbusiness considerations, and geographic distribution of subcontracts. OtherConsiderations is not numerically weighted or scored. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">6. Mission Suitability is the only factor which is numerically weighted(normally 1000 points) and scored. Further, each Mission Suitability subfactoris numerically weighted and scored. The sum of the subfactor weights willtotal the weight of the Mission Suitability factor. A subfactor may, atthe discretion of the SEB, be divided into discrete elements which, intotal, comprise the subfactor evaluation area. If deemed conducive to theevaluation process, the SEB may weigh and score individual elements ofa subfactor. The sum of the weights of the individual elements will equalthe weight of the subfactor. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">7. The general format for inclusion of the factors, subfactors, andelements in the RFP are:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">a. Factor (numerically scored)_Mission Suitability Grouping/Category(not numerically scored)_i.e., Technical or Management (optional) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="24">(1) Subfactor (numerically scored) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="24">(2) Subfactor (numerically scored) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="24">(3) Subfactor (numerically scored) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="24">Element (optional). May or may not be numerically scored.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">b. Factor (not numerically scored)_Cost </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">c. Factor (not numerically scored)_Relevant Experience and Past Performance</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">d. Factor (not numerically scored)_Other Considerations </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">301 Mission Suitability </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="71">1. Evaluation Subfactors </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">a. Evaluation subfactors are the weighted areas within the MissionSuitability factor that further identify, for proposal preparation andevaluation purposes, the content of the factor. Examples of Mission Suitabilitysubfactors found by experience to be relevant to many procurements are:Understanding of the Requirement; Management Plan; Key Personnel; Corporateor Company Resources; and Excellence of Proposed Design for hardware procurements.However, citation of these specific subfactors is not intended to be restrictiveor all inclusive. The nature and thrust of the requirements and objectivesof the procurement may logically call for the use of some subfactors titledand described in a somewhat different manner than those described below:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(1) <T3>Understanding of the Requirement. </T3>An offeror's proposal reflectshow well the offeror comprehends the work and the data requirements. Theofferor's proposal should be examined and analyzed to evaluate the offeror'sunderstanding of the requirements set forth in the RFP. Understanding ofthe requirement can be evaluated as a separate subfactor or can be evaluatedas an element to be considered as a part of the evaluation of each subfactor.Although costs are analyzed separately from Mission Suitability, they maybe significant in indicating an offeror's understanding of the resources,human and material, required for performance of the contract. Accordingly,technical personnel assigned to committees or panels, in evaluation ofthe Mission Suitability factor pursuant to the weighted subfactors andelements, may be given access to the cost proposals or portions of thecost proposals to help determine the offeror's understanding of the requirementsof the RFP. Such cost information may also help them to assess the validityof the offeror's approach to performing the work in accordance with therequirements. Cost realism, or the lack thereof, should enter into theSEB's assessment of the measure of understanding possessed by each offeror.Normally this would entail a consideration of cost realism in the evaluationof all subfactors and elements wherein understanding is an essential concept.Similarly, an offeror's justification or rationale for proposed costs cangive insight into how well the work to be performed is understood. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) <T3>Management Plan. </T3>(a) The offeror's management plan sets forththe offeror's approach for efficiently managing the work as demonstratedby the proposed organization, the recognition of essential management functions,and the effective overall integration of these functions. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(b) The management plan describes the project organization proposedfor the work, including internal operations and lines of authority, togetherwith external interfaces and relationships with the Government, major subcontractors,and associate contractors. When properly prepared, the authority of theproject manager, the project manager's relationship to the next echelonof management, and the project manager's command of company resources canbe ascertained from the management plan. Likewise, the management planprovides schedules necessary for the logical and timely pursuit of thework, accompanied by a description of the offeror's work plan. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(3) <T3>Excellence of Proposed Design. </T3>In hardware acquisition, designof the product is generally a major aspect of competition. In order toarrive at an informed judgment, the SSO may require the SEB's evaluationof the merits of competing designs in relationship to the stated requirement.In evaluating the proposed designs, the SEB should consider the resourcesrequired to perform the work inherent in the differing designs. Evaluationof design may extend to whatever subsystem level is deemed appropriateby the SEB and may include producibility, reliability, maintainability,and, as applicable, warranties. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(4) <T3>Key Personnel.</T3> (a) Thorough evaluation of proposed key personnelis usually one of the most vital aspects of SEB activity.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(b) Experience demonstrates that the qualifications and performanceof a few people_the top half-dozen or so directly involved managers_areextremely important to successful accomplishment of a contract. For evaluationpurposes, the SEB may designate a separate subfactor entitled ``Key Personnel.''The SEB may define the number and identity of the key personnel for eachofferor in the solicitation or may, subject to such limitations as theSEB deems appropriate to assure a reasonable basis for comparison, permiteach offeror to define its own key personnel consistent with its proposedorganization.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(c) Written reandCx.174;1sumeandCx.174;1s should be the baseline fromwhich the evaluation of key personnel begins. Personal reference checkswith people knowledgeable of an individual's training, experience, andperformance constitute part of this baseline; these should be made at levelscommensurate with the role of the individual in the program or projectinvolved. However, the written and/or oral discussions, if conducted, willinclude all offerors in the competitive range and may be used to establishthe relative merits of personnel proposed by each competing firm.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(d) The presentation to the SSO must clearly and concisely set forththe results of the evaluation and discussion, including the strengths andweaknesses of each offeror's key personnel.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(5) <T3>Corporate or Company Resources.</T3> The SEB should assess the resourcesproposed by each offeror in the general areas of human resources and facilities.For example, are the proper skill mixes and numbers of people to do thework being offered? Does the offeror propose facilities and, where required,special test equipment suitable and adequate to assure timely performanceof the work? If the offeror does not possess adequate resources internally,is there a demonstration of the ability to acquire them through subcontractsor otherwise?</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">b. Elements that further define the content of each subfactor maybe used. If individually numerically scored, these elements must be revealedin the RFP and must be assigned a specific weighting in the SEB's evaluationplan as a portion of the total points allotted. If they are not numericallyscored, identification in the RFP is not required.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">c. Establishment of evaluation subfactors, elements, and their weightsrequires judgment on a case-by-case basis. The subfactors and elementsestablished and included in the RFP will then be utilized to determineeach offeror's rating in Mission Suitability, including its understandingof the requirements, approach to the work, and the competence of personnelto be directly involved.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">d. By carefully considering the requirement(s) to be satisfied throughthe products or services being procured, the SEB should be able to identify,analyze, and score discrete subfactors and, where appropriate, elementsthat determine how well the proposed product or service can be expectedto meet the demands of the specific requirement(s). If individual subfactors,elements, and their weights are prudently established, the integrated scoresof the subfactors and elements will give a representative picture of themerit of each offeror's Mission Suitability.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">e. (1) In structuring evaluation subfactors and elements, emphasisshould be placed on identification of significant discriminators. Proliferationof subfactors and elements results in a leveling or averaging out of scoresover all proposals. Too many subfactors and elements are detrimental toeffective evaluation of proposals. Further, clearly defining each evaluationsubfactor and element helps to avoid overlap and redundancy. Avoiding suchoverlap assures an offeror is not scored in two or more areas for the samework.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) The following example conveys one approach to describing a subfactor,utilizing elements, in an RFP. Within the ``management plan'' subfactorthe following elements may be determined by the SEB as most suitable toassess how well each offeror's overall management proposal would contributeto the probability of performing the contract in an excellent manner: (a)Management approach and organization; (b) staffing plan; and (c) managementsystems.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">f. For each subfactor and element, there should be detailed instructionsprovided in the RFP's Section L, ``Instructions, Conditions, and Noticesto Offerors or Quoters,'' specifying what supporting information shouldbe included in the proposals and the specific format to be used. This increasesthe probability that SEB evaluators will be provided necessary data inthe format easiest to understand and evaluate relative to the subfactorsand elements assigned for evaluation and assessment. Thought given to carefullystructuring these instructions will generally result in proposals thataddress what the Government is most interested in relative to the workto be performed. For example, if the evaluation will utilize SEB committeesor SEB panels, instructions for proposal preparation in the RFP's SectionL that direct offerors to group together information required by such committeesor panels will facilitate and accelerate the evaluation process.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">g. Where the procurement involves acquisition of a major system underNMI 7100.14, ``Major System Acquisitions,'' and the evaluation is to identifythe most promising system design concept(s) to be selected for furtherexploration, the evaluation should also address the benefits to be derivedby tradeoffs, where feasible, among technical performance, acquisitioncost, ownership cost, and time to develop and procure.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="71">2. Weighting of Factors, Subfactors, and Elements</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">a. Numerical weights shall be used for evaluating the Mission Suitabilityfactor for competing offerors.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">b. (1) Once the Mission Suitability subfactors are established, theSEB will determine the weight assigned to each. Likewise, if elements areestablished, the SEB will determine the weight, if any, assigned to each.The proposed subfactors, elements, and weights will be presented to theSSO or designee for approval. The weight assigned to each subfactor and,if numerically scored, each element must reflect its relative importancewithin the overall Mission Suitability factor. In conjunction, an evaluationplan covering not only Mission Suitability evaluation, but all evaluationfactors (Mission Suitability, Cost, Relevant Experience and Past Performance,and Other Considerations), will be established by the SEB (see Chapter4). Mission Suitability evaluation subfactors, elements, and their weightsshall be established and approved in advance of RFP issuance. The fourfactors and their supporting subfactors and, if numerically scored, elementsshall be described in the RFP's Section M, ``Evaluation Factors for Award,''and the weights associated with the individual Mission Suitability subfactorsand elements shall be revealed in section M as well. However, care shouldbe taken to avoid the impression of a mathematical evaluation devoid ofjudgment. The weights are intended to be used by the SSO as a guideline.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) If all evaluation factors are considered by the SEB to be of approximatelyequal importance, a statement to that effect shall be included in the RFP.However, if there is a difference in the level of importance among thefactors, then a statement shall be included in the RFP to advise the offerorsof the relative importance of the factors. In this regard, one exampleof a statement that might be appropriate, depending on the nature of therequirements, type of contract, and objectives of the acquisition, is asfollows:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="20">``Of the four evaluation factors identified above, Mission Suitabilityand Cost are most important, and, as related to each other, are approximatelyequal in importance. The Relevant Experience and Past Performance factoris of somewhat less importance than either Mission Suitability or Cost,and the Other Considerations factor is of considerably less importancethan Relevant Experience and Past Performance. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The subfactors to be used in evaluating Mission Suitability and theircorresponding weights are listed below in descending order of importance:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">Understanding of the Requirement </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="24">(40 percent) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">Excellence of Proposed Design </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="24">(30 percent) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">Management Plan </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="24">(15 percent) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">Key Personnel </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="24">(10 percent) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">Corporate or Company Resources </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="24">(5 percent)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The numerical weights assigned to the five subfactors identified aboveare indicative of the relative importance of those evaluation areas. Theweights will be utilized only as a guide.'' </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">302 Cost </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1. Before issuing a solicitation, the contracting officer and technicalpersonnel shall (when it is feasible to do so) develop a Government costestimate for the planned acquisition. Estimates can range from simple budgetaryestimates to complex estimates based on inspection of the product itselfand review of such items as drawings, specifications, and prior data. TheSEB is tasked with the responsibility to ensure that the Government costestimate properly reflects the effort to which the RFP applies. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. In the Cost factor evaluation, the SEB shall analyze the proposedcosts or prices of all offerors. The SEB may use any and all tools availablein performing these analyses including information in the Armed ServicesPricing Manual (ASPM). However, the required depth of the analysis is subjectto the criteria in FAR 15.804. The SEB shall advise the SSO concerning_</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">a. The costs or prices as proposed by all offerors, including thosenot within the competitive range; </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">b. The comparison of costs proposed by all offerors, with the independentGovernment cost estimate, when feasible; </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">c. The realism of costs proposed by all offerors determined to bewithin the competitive range. Cost realism is a review of the proposalto determine if the overall costs proposed are realistic for the work tobe performed, if the costs reflect an offeror's understanding of the requirements,and if the costs are consistent with the various elements of the technicalproposal. This type of analysis will be used in the Cost area and MissionSuitability or other technical areas; </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">d. The probable cost to the Government of, at a minimum, each proposalwithin the competitive range. If it appears to the SEB that any offeror'sapproach(es) or plan(s) for accomplishing the proposed work will requiremodification in order to be acceptable to the Government, the SEB shallidentify and assess the modification required, determine the probable costof such modification, and include that probable cost assessment in itsreport to the SSO; </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">e. The differences in business methods, operating procedures, andpractices as they impact cost; and </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">f. Its level of confidence in the probable cost assessments as theypertain to each fully evaluated proposal. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">3. The probable cost should reflect the SEB's best estimate of thecost of any contract which might result from that offeror's proposal, includingany recommended additions or reductions in personnel, equipment, or materials.To the extent that the recommended additions or reductions reflect a lackof understanding of the requirements of the RFP, that lack of understandingshould be reflected in the scoring of the Mission Suitability factor, subfactors,and elements. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">4. A well-defined statement of work reflecting clear, concise workbreakdown structures is of great value in obtaining well-structured proposalsand in allowing the SEB to understand and assess proposed costs. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">5. All cost categories and amounts present in an offeror's cost proposal(including options) are to be analyzed by the SEB and reported to the SSO.In the event SEB members have different opinions as to the cost analysesand assessments of probable costs, these differing opinions should be reportedto the SSO to aid in forming an opinion regarding the confidence to beattributed to the analyses and assessments. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">303 Relevant Experience and Past Performance </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1. This factor has been established to give relevant experience andpast performance proper emphasis in the evaluation and selection process.Assessments to be made regarding relevant experience and past performance,particularly past performance, may be extremely difficult. In more straightforwardcases, this assessment may be based upon well-documented and highly reliableevidence portraying favorable or unfavorable experience and past performance.More often, these assessments will be made from data presenting a less-than-optimumdegree of well-documented evidence of a company's experience and past performance.The problem for the SEB will be establishing an acceptable degree of confidencethat the data sources are providing an impartial, fair, and accurate representationof relevant experience and past performance. The SEB must be extremelycareful in making the judgments and conclusions required under this factorbut must not hesitate to assess relevant experience and past performance,positively or negatively, when the information received would reasonablysupport such an assessment. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. This factor addresses evaluation of overall relevant experienceand past performance for the company, not the experience and past performanceof individuals involved with contract performance; the latter are to beevaluated under key personnel within the Mission Suitability factor. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">3. Relevant experience reflects the accomplishment of work by an offerorthat is comparable to or related to the work or effort required under theinstant procurement. Programs or projects of comparable magnitude thatinclude technical, cost, schedule, and management constraints similar tothose expected to be encountered in the instant procurement are clearlyrelevant. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">4. Past performance is especially important; how well the offerorperformed on similar work may be a significant indicator of performanceon the job at hand. Many organizations exhibit characteristics that persistover time_for example, the ability to move projects out of the researchenvironment and to translate research findings into practical, results-orientedhardware; difficulty in transitioning conceptual efforts into soundly engineered``hardcopy'' plans which can be produced economically; resiliency in theface of trouble; resourcefulness; management determination that the organizationlive up to its commitments; and skill in development of key people. Itis essential to develop such an indicator independent of the offeror'sproposal. It is the responsibility of the SEB to collect and document informationon the past performance of, at a minimum, all offerors within the competitiverange. The SEB should personally contact program or project managers withinNASA or other Government agencies in a position to have responsibly observedperformance of the offerors as either a prime or major subcontractor andobtain their views concerning the quality of the work the offeror did (oris doing) on comparable jobs. In the event a substantially unfavorableresponse is received which, in the opinion of the SEB will be of specialsignificance to the SSO, the offeror in question will be provided an opportunityduring written and/or oral discussions (see Chapter 4) to clarify thatresponse. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">5. The SEB is responsible for collecting and developing relevant experienceand past performance information, identifying the source, and presentingit to the SSO. While the clearly relevant experience or past performanceis of prime importance, other experience or past performance determinedby the SEB to be significant or to be indicative of company experienceor past performance should be noted and brought to the attention of theSSO. All pertinent information, including project manager assessments andofferor responses, will be: </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(a) Made part of the SEB's records,  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(b) Contained in the SEB report, and  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(c) Presented to the SSO. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">6. The Relevant Experience and Past Performance factor is not numericallyscored but is assigned an adjectival rating by the SEB. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">7. This factor may be a significant consideration in the selectionprocess. Therefore, the basis of the evaluation must be thoroughly identifiedand well documented. While objectivity is desirable, reasonable judgmentsoften have to be made in the evaluation process. Subjectivity is not improper;an SEB should not hesitate to make reasonable subjective evaluations ofrelevant experience and past performance based upon as much factual dataand experiential information as can be reasonably accumulated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">304 Other Considerations </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1. This factor includes all considerations other than Mission Suitability,Cost, and Relevant Experience and Past Performance that the SSO will considerin making a final selection. Only Other Considerations specifically identifiedin the RFP shall be considered by the SSO in making a decision. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. Following is a listing of Other Considerations that may be appropriateto include in an RFP. Not all of the subfactors listed are necessarilyapplicable to all procurements; nor is the listing intended to be all inclusiveor restrictive:  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">a. Financial condition and capability.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">b. Corporate priority on the work being proposed, or importance ofthe business to corporate management.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">c.

Extent of proposed small and small disadvantaged business, andwomen-owned small business enterprise participation in subcontracting arrangements. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">e. Geographic distribution of the work to be performed.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">f. Acceptance of contract terms and conditions set forth in the RFP. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">g. Any other subfactors pertinent to the particular procurement andidentified under the Other Considerations factor within the RFP. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">3. Other Considerations shall be defined specifically in the RFP,evaluated by the SEB, and reported to the SSO. Certain subfactors underthe Other Considerations factor, such as financial condition and capability,may undergo change up to the moment of source selection. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">4. Information regarding some of the Other Considerations is generallyavailable to an SEB in the form of preaward surveys, NASA inspection reports,facility capability reports, purchasing system surveys, audit reports,and equal employment opportunity surveys. The SEB should make every reasonableeffort to identify and use timely existing reports before initiating originalinquiries. While written reports such as those mentioned in this paragraphmay be significant, they should not be exclusively relied upon by the SEB.In addition, personal inquiries should be directed to Government managerslikely to be knowledgeable about the offeror's record in these areas. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">305 Continuing Evaluative Responsibility of SEB </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Even after the SEB has made its formal report to the SSO, the SEBshall have continuing responsibility to report to the SSO, until its discharge,any circumstances that would change the SEB's evaluation findings relativeto any evaluation factor (Mission Suitability, Cost, Relevant Experienceand Past Performance, and Other Considerations) for any offeror. It isnot intended that, after its report, the SEB actively pursue continuingevaluation. What is expected is that matters related to any of the evaluationfactors which come to the attention of the SEB, and which might be expectedto be pertinent to the selection decision, will be communicated to theSSO. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="75">Chapter 4_SEB Operating Procedures for Solicitation and Evaluation</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">400 General </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">This Chapter describes procedural steps in preparing the SEB for itswork and outlines SEB activities for solicitation and evaluation of proposals.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">401 Initial SEB Activities </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1. Official SEB activities commence upon receipt by the Chairpersonof the letter establishing the SEB and designating its members which shouldbe no later than approval of the procurement plan. However, prior to officialestablishment of the SEB, the proposed SEB Chairperson and members mayhold meetings to accomplish such tasks as SEB member orientation to proposedoperational procedures, security measures that will be utilized, and preliminaryreview of the proposed RFP. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. Once the SEB is established, the SEB Chairperson shall ensure that_</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">a. A management and staffing plan is prepared, indicating necessarypersonnel and other resource requirements, including a time schedule forSEB actions and events leading to presentation of findings to the SSO; </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">b. Each SEB voting member is furnished appropriate information regardingthe nature of the procurement in addition to a copy of their designationletter, approved procurement plan, and the projected time schedule; </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">c. Each SEB participant, voting and nonvoting, is cautioned concerningrestrictions on disclosure of information during the SEB process, avoidanceof conflicts of interest, and conformity with the NASA Standards of Conduct.Each SEB participant, voting and nonvoting, shall file a NASA Form 1270,``Confidential Statement of Employment and Financial Interests,'' in accordancewith NHB 1900.1, ``Standards of Conduct for NASA Employees.'' In addition,each SEB participant shall sign an appropriate nondisclosure statement(a sample nondisclosure statement is included in Appendix B). These documentsshall be reviewed by the Associate General Counsel for General Law or designeefor Headquarters employees or by the cognizant Field Installation ChiefCounsel or designee for field installation employees.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">d. Letters are issued to all personnel involved in the SEB's activitiesadvising them of pertinent restrictions and prohibitions, including a cautionnot to discuss any aspect of the procurement with anyone not having a need-to-know.The right to information on a need-to-know basis does not extend to thenormal chain of supervision of any member of the SEB or to any individualhaving technical responsibility for the effort being evaluated except asspecifically approved by the SEB Chairperson on a case-by-case basis. Thoseindividuals will also be notified by the SEB Chairperson, in writing, ofthe privileged character of proposal information;  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">e. The list of sources to be solicited is developed and approved bythe SEB with the assistance of the cognizant procurement and program orproject offices;  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">f. Whenever it is expected to be beneficial, a draft RFP or Statementof Work is issued to prospective offerors for comment;  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">g. Prior to RFP issuance, the substance and the weight of evaluationfactors, subfactors, and elements, as well as the substance of any applicablequalification standards, are presented to the SSO or designee for approval; </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">h. The RFP is reviewed and approved by the SEB prior to issuance; </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">i. During the competitive phase of the procurement, every effort mustbe made to assure fair and equitable treatment of all offerors (both prospectiveand actual). Upon release of the formal RFP, the Chairperson shall imposea communication blackout, in writing, by directing all personnel associatedwith the procurement to refrain from communicating with prospective offerors,formally or informally, regarding any aspects of the procurement. All inquiriesregarding the procurement shall be referred to the contracting officer;and  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">j. Prior to receipt of proposals, the evaluation plan is reviewedand approved by the SEB and cognizant management personnel. The evaluationplan, once approved, must be impartially applied by the SEB to each proposal.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">402 Evaluation Plan </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1. The SEB evaluation plan consists of general and specific evaluationguidelines (and qualification standards, where applicable) establishedto assess each offeror's proposal relative to the evaluation factors, subfactors,and elements set forth in the RFP. The evaluation guidelines are designedto focus the evaluators' assessment. They are not weighted and are notlisted in the RFP. However, the substance of the guidelines may be includedin a narrative description of the subfactors and elements. In addition,the plan includes the system used in conducting the evaluation and scoringeach offeror's proposal. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. The SEB determines what evaluation factors, subfactors, and elementsto assign to the various committees and panels. While it is necessary togive committees and panels all information required to conduct an evaluationof their assigned area, it is not appropriate to disclose to them the specificscoring system used by the SEB in scoring proposals. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">3. The detailed SEB evaluation plan to be used by the SEB, committees,and panels should be approved before the RFP is issued but, in any case,shall be approved before proposals are evaluated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">403 Qualification Standards</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1. It is NASA policy to offer the opportunity to compete for its procurementsas broadly as is consistent with the nature of each particular procurement.However, in view of the distinctive characteristics of NASA programs, thosepotential offerors that do not possess the minimum qualifications and resourcesnecessary to perform the proposed work of a given procurement should notbe encouraged to incur proposal and other expenses involved in competitivesubmissions. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. To accomplish this objective without limiting meaningful competitionrequires early and intense effort on the part of the SEB, working in conjunctionwith the program and procurement staff most familiar with the procurementrequirements. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">3. When the nature of the procurement requires, qualification standardsmay be established in accordance with FAR 9.104-2. These will consist ofspecial experience, capability, or specialized facilities critical to programperformance aspects of the procurement. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">4. In establishing qualification standards, care must be exercisedto restrict them to those essential to the successful completion of thecontract work. Qualification standards may be employed only where it ispossible for the SEB to establish standards which are justified by thenature of the particular procurement. These standards must be applied equallyto all potential sources. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">5. When developed by the SEB and approved by the SSO or designee,qualification standards shall be clearly set forth in the RFP and includedin the Commerce Business Daily synopsis. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">6. Approved qualification standards will be used by the SEB to screenproposed source list(s) so that only firms possessing those unique specializedfacilities, capability, or experience deemed critical to program performanceaspects of the procurement will be solicited. Notwithstanding the considerationsthat lead to the elimination of sources from solicitation, any firm maysubmit a proposal. These same qualification standards will be used to considerall sources who may submit a proposal. This assures that the presolicitationconsideration of prospective contractor qualification standards does notact to restrict competition, but only to discourage costly proposal submissionsfrom potential offerors to whom award would not appear likely and thatall offerors shall have an equal opportunity to compete. If an offerorfails to meet the stated qualification standards, the proposal shall berejected, not considered further in the evaluation, and the offeror informedof the basis of rejection. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">404 Request for Proposals (RFP's)_Review and Approval </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1. Effectiveness of the evaluation is dependent, in large measure,on how well the work to be performed and the basic ground rules under whichthe competition will be conducted are described in the RFP. Accordingly,the RFP shall be reviewed by the SEB and approved by appropriate levelsof management prior to issuance to ensure its acceptability. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. In reviewing the RFP, the SEB and appropriate management shallensure that the following matters pertinent to source evaluation and selectionare fully covered in the solicitation:  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">a. Any qualification standards shall be identified and described. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">b. Evaluation factors shall be described, including a general narrativeexplanation of their relative importance.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">c. The Mission Suitability factor shall be described. Evaluation subfactorsshall be identified and described, including their numerical weights. Ifdeemed conducive to the evaluation process, elements of a subfactor shallbe identified and described, including their numerical weights.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">d. The Cost factor shall be described.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(1) When uncertainties involved in contract requirements necessitatethe use of a cost-type contract, offerors may be motivated to perform withinthe proposed cost estimate through the inclusion of appropriate cost incentivearrangements. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) Negotiated indirect cost rate ceilings shall be used only in accordancewith FAR 42.707.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">e. The Relevant Experience and Past Performance factor shall be described.The identification data and contact or customer references required byNFS 1815.406-70(b)(6) for the conduct of this evaluation shall be stated.Offerors should be cautioned that omissions or an inaccurate or inadequateresponse to this evaluation category could have a negative effect on overallevaluation. Offerors should also be advised that, in addition to informationthey provide, the SEB will consider all information available to NASA regardingthe offeror's relevant experience and past performance.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">f. The Other Considerations factor shall be described.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">g. The method of evaluation shall be explained clearly, but concisely,so that prospective offerors understand the SEB's use and treatment ofthe factors, subfactors, and elements.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">h. When cost proposals are permitted to be submitted after technicalproposals, a notice shall be included in the RFP stating the required datefor each submission.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">i. When applicable, a notice that a preproposal conference is to beheld shall be included, stating its purpose, time, place, and scope.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">j. The Statement of Work shall describe as clearly and concisely aspossible the product or service to be procured. It shall be structuredto identify the important areas of emphasis. There must be no inconsistenciesbetween it and the evaluation factors, subfactors, and elements to be usedby the SEB and the SSO. Nonessential or unduly restrictive requirementsshall be eliminated.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">k. Requirements for reports and data essential to contract evaluationand performance shall be clearly described, including a cross referenceto the Statement of Work and a schedule for submission.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">l. When the procurement involves a major system under NMI 7100.14,the SEB will ensure that the RFP is prepared in terms of mission need soeach offeror can respond with an alternative system design concept proposalto satisfy the mission need and can propose a technical approach, designfeatures, and alternatives to schedule, cost, and capability goals consistentwith that concept. In order to remove inhibitions to innovative solutionsand to improve the approach to achieving program objectives, considerationshould be given to conducting orientation briefings for prospective offerorsand, where appropriate, solicit comments on a draft of the solicitation. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">m. Any limitations on pages and the number of copies of offerors'initial proposals shall be included. When imposing a firm page limitation,the solicitation must clearly state that the evaluators will read onlyup to the maximum number of pages specified. Pages in excess of the maximumare to be removed from the proposal and not evaluated, but retained asa part of the official contract file. Guidance on the number of pages preferredin offerors' proposals may be used in lieu of a firm page limitation. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">3. The SSO may request a detailed review of the RFP beyond that ofthe SEB and cognizant management personnel or may, more specifically, requesta detailed review of the Statement of Work, qualification standards, evaluationfactors, subfactors, elements, or other areas pertinent to proposal preparation,evaluation, and source selection. Specific reviewing officials or officesmay be designated for this purpose. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">4. The RFP shall comply with all current regulations and directivesapplicable to NASA solicitations; particular emphasis is placed on therequirements of FAR 15.406 and NFS 1815.406. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">5. When detailed program or project support plans will be requiredas part of the offeror's proposal but are not considered important discriminatorsin the evaluation process, the requirements for these plans shall be describedin separate appendices to the Statement of Work in accordance with NFS1815.406-70(a)(7). </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">6. When, either before or after receipt of proposals, the Governmentmodifies its requirements, the contracting officer is required to issuea written amendment to the RFP in accordance with FAR 15.606. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">405 Preproposal Conference </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1. A preproposal conference to brief prospective offerors may be conductedafter a solicitation has been issued but before proposals are received,in accordance with FAR 15.409. The contracting officer, in conjunctionwith the SEB, shall make a determination, prior to issuance of the RFP,as to whether a preproposal conference is required. Generally, these conferencesbenefit both the Government and prospective offerors in complex acquisitionswhere it is necessary to explain or clarify complicated specificationsand requirements. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. The conference shall be scheduled to permit prospective offerorssufficient time after the issuance of the RFP to become familiar with theRFP requirements yet not too late to allow meaningful use of the informationobtained at the conference. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">3. The conference should include a presentation of the significantaspects of the procurement followed by a question and answer session. Arecord of all information provided at the conference, together with a copyof all questions and answers, shall be provided to all prospective offerorsby formal written amendment to the solicitation. If it becomes apparentat the conference that the RFP needs revision, the revised requirementsmust be included in a written amendment. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">406 Initial Evaluation </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1. Upon receipt of proposals, the contracting officer shall mark eachproposal with the date and time of receipt and forward all proposals tothe SEB Chairperson or the SEB Recorder for control and safeguarding throughoutthe evaluation process. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. Late proposals or modifications shall be handled in accordancewith FAR 15.412. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">3. Procedure for Evaluation of a Single Proposal_</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">a. If only one proposal is received in response to the solicitation,the contracting officer shall examine the situation to ascertain the reasonsfor the single response. The contracting officer shall include a writtennotation in the contract file describing the circumstances surroundingthe receipt of a single proposal as well as a determination whether ornot the solicitation was or was not flawed or unduly restrictive, priorto releasing the proposal to the SEB for evaluation.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">b. The SEB shall complete a limited preliminary evaluation to determinethat the single proposal submitted satisfies stated qualification standards,if any, and is otherwise an acceptable proposal (see subparagraph 406.5).Upon completion of this limited preliminary evaluation, a letter shallbe forwarded to the SSO presenting a summary of the evaluation results. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">c. The SSO shall as a result of reviewing the SEB summary, and thecontracting officer's examination of the facts and determination, notifythe SEB Chairperson that either_ </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"> (1) The SEB is instructed to proceed with preestablished SEB procedures,including complete initial evaluation, oral and written discussions, requestand receipt of a Best and Final Offer (BAFO), and final evaluation, culminatingin a formal presentation to the SSO for approval to enter into negotiations; </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) The contracting officer is instructed to immediately enter intonegotiations resulting in a complete contract document, signed by the offeror,to be signed by the contracting officer upon approval by the SSO. Uponcompletion of the negotiations, the SEB shall present the results to theSSO for approval; or  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(3) The SEB Chairperson is granted full delegation of authority todisband the SEB and to instruct the contracting officer to conduct negotiationsfor contract award without further SSO involvement.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(4) The contracting officer is instructed to reject the single proposalreceived and to cancel the solicitation.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">d. These procedures are likewise applicable when the number of proposalsequals the number of awards contemplated or when only one acceptable proposalis received as defined by subparagraph 406.5 of this handbook. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">4. Committee Evaluations_ </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">a. The initial phase of evaluation generally will involve establishedcommittees. As promptly as possible, committees are to be convened. TheSEB Chairperson shall transmit to the committees proposals or portionsof proposals to be evaluated, instructions regarding the expected functionof each committee, and all data considered necessary or helpful. The committeechairperson is responsible for instructing the members as to committeefunctions, responsibilities, and procedures.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">b. While oral reports may be given to the SEB, the committee functionrequires the submission of a written report which should include_ </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"> (1) Copies of individual worksheets and supporting comments to thelowest level evaluated;  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) An evaluation sheet summarized for the committee as a whole; and </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(3) A statement for each proposal describing any strengths or weaknesseswhich significantly affected the evaluation and stating any reservationsor concerns, together with supporting rationale, which the committee orany of its members want to bring to the attention of the SEB.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">c. It is imperative that the SEB provide clear traceability throughoutthe evaluation process. This traceability must exist at all levels of theSEB process. All reports submitted by committees or panels will be retainedas part of the SEB records but need not necessarily be included as partof the SEB report to the SSO. A committee report should be included withnecessary to the SSO's understanding of the SEB's action.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">d. Each voting SEB member shall thoroughly review each proposal. Committeereports and findings shall be reviewed by the SEB. The SEB is to considerthe committee evaluation, take into account any reservations or concernsstated by the SEB members and the committee, and rate or score the proposalsfor each evaluation factor, subfactor, and element according to its owncollective judgment. SEB minutes shall reflect this evaluation processwhich shall be consistent with the approved evaluation plan. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">5. Identification of Unacceptable Proposals_ </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">a. The SEB may discontinue the evaluation of any proposal which isunacceptable because_ </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"> (1) It does not represent a reasonable initial effort to addressitself to the essential requirements of the RFP or clearly demonstratesthat the offeror does not understand the requirements of the RFP;  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) In research and development procurement, a substantial designdrawback is evident in the proposal, and sufficient correction or improvementto consider the proposal acceptable would require virtually an entirelynew technical proposal; or  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(3) It contains major technical or business deficiencies or omissionsor out-of-line costs which discussions with the offeror could not reasonablybe expected to cure.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">b. Simple technical nonresponsiveness in the sense in which the termis used in sealed bidding is not alone sufficient to constitute unacceptabilityif the proposal is otherwise competitive and written and/or oral discussions,or negotiations after selection, reasonably offer the likelihood of resolution.When there is doubt as to whether a proposal should be rejected initiallyas unacceptable, that doubt shall be resolved by including it for furtherconsideration.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">c. The SEB must document its judgment that the deficiencies of anyproposal are sufficiently significant to warrant discontinuing evaluationof the proposal at this point in the process. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">6. SEB Findings_ </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">a. Preparing the results of the initial evaluation in a narrativeSEB report is an important aspect of the evaluation process. The SEB shouldbe aware that the SEB report and presentation provide the principal toolsavailable to the SSO to perform a comparative analysis in making a sourceselection decision. Guidelines for the report and presentation are setforth in Chapter 5 and Appendix C. For each proposal, the SEB should indicatein the narrative whether the proposal meets or fails to meet any of therequirements of the RFP; all strengths and weaknesses of the proposal andwhether they are correctable; the proposed and probable cost (normallyrequired only for those offeror(s) in the competitive range or those offeror(s)eliminated from competitive range on the basis of cost); the technical,schedule, and cost risk associated with the proposal; and the adjectivalrating of the Relevant Experience and Past Performance and Other Considerationsevaluation factors. Strengths and weaknesses must be further defined inthe SEB report as major or minor to provide a valuable summary of discriminatorsamong proposals in addition to supporting the adjectival ratings assignedto each Mission Suitability subfactor and element by the SEB, and for theMission Suitability factor as a whole. In addition to the narrative reportof evaluation findings, the SEB will apply the Mission Suitability scoringsystem detailed in the evaluation plan to rate each proposal in relationto the Mission Suitability evaluation subfactors and elements.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">b. In structuring an applicable rating system, the following adjectiveratings, definitions, and percentile ranges shall be used for the evaluationof Mission Suitability subfactors, and, if individually weighted and scored,elements. (The total proposal should also be classified with an appropriateadjectival rating for Mission Suitability.) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="110"><C/> <H1> </H1><H1>Percentile range</H1> <ITAG tagnum="1">Excellent_A comprehensive  and thorough proposal of exceptional  meritwith one or  more major strengths.  No weaknesses or  only minor correctable weaknesses exist <D>91-100 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Very Good_A proposal which  demonstrates overall competence. One  ormore major strengths  have been found, and  strengths out balance  anyweaknesses that  exist. Any major weaknesses are correctable <D>71-90 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Good_A proposal which  shows a reasonably  sound response.  There maybe strengths  or weaknesses, or both.  As a whole, weaknesses,  not offsetby strengths,  do not significantly  detract from the offeror's  response.Major weaknesses are probably  correctable <D>51-70 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Fair_A proposal that has  one or more weaknesses.  Weaknesses havebeen  found that outbalance  any strengths that exist.  Major weaknessescan  probably be improved,  minimized, or corrected <D>31-50 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Poor_A proposal that has one or more major weaknesses  which are expectedto be  difficult to correct, or  are not correctable <D>0-30</D></ITAG></ITAG>  <ITAG tagnum="21">c. Normally, proposals are to be rated using adjectival ratings ontwo occasions as follows:  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(1) Upon completion of the initial evaluation of proposals, and  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) Upon completion of the final evaluation of the BAFO's. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Both ratings will be maintained by the SEB, included in the SEB report,and presented to the SSO. There shall be clear traceability of any scoringchanges between initial and best and final proposals. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">7. Determination of Competitive Range_  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">a. Subsequent to the initial identification of proposals consideredunacceptable, the SEB will compile initial evaluation findings, of allremaining acceptable proposals, sufficient for determination of the competitiverange in accordance with FAR 15.609 and NFS 1815.613-71(b)(4). The competitiverange shall be determined by the SEB together with the contracting officeron the basis of Mission Suitability, Cost, Relevant Experience and PastPerformance, and Other Considerations stated in the solicitation and shallinclude all proposals that have a reasonable chance of being selected foraward. Competitive range determinations are final unless the SSO determinesotherwise. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">b. The objective of a competitive range determination is not to eliminateproposals but to facilitate competition by conducting written and/or oraldiscussions with only those offerors who have a reasonable chance of beingselected for award. Where there is doubt as to whether a proposal is oris not within the competitive range, the proposal should be included withinthe competitive range. The determination of competitive range is a complexdetermination based on informed judgment. All competitive range decisionsshall be completely and adequately documented in the contract file in accordancewith NFS 1815.613-71(b)(4).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">8. Notification of Unsuccessful Offerors. The contracting officershall notify each unsuccessful offeror in accordance with FAR 15.1001(b)at the earliest practicable time, in writing, that its proposal is no longerto be considered for contract award.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">407 Final Evaluation</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="71">1. Evaluation of Plant and Facilities</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">a. Inspections at the plants of competing offerors could provide valuableinsight into the SEB's evaluation of proposals. For instance, in procurementswhere significant experimental, research, developmental, testing, fabrication,or other work is to be performed (the quality of which may be affectedby a contractor's plant or facilities), a complete evaluation may requirean on-site visit by the SEB. For other procurements, e.g., support servicescontracts, plant inspections may serve no useful purpose.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">b. When plant inspections are conducted, the visiting team shall includeSEB members and any qualified experts required by the SEB. At least oneSEB member shall be the same on all team visits to provide continuity anda basis for comparison. Visits are to be conducted, generally, after theSEB's initial evaluation has been completed and for a specific, clearlyunderstood purpose. Visits shall be conducted only with the approval ofthe SEB Chairperson, who will ensure that all visits are made on an impartialbasis. All personnel must remember that only the contracting officer cancommit NASA and that they must avoid any contact with an offeror that isnot essential or which could raise questions of impropriety. A visit toall offerors within the competitive range is advisable if plant inspectionsare being conducted.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">c. Some potential benefits of plant visits are_</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(1) Reviewing with resident Government personnel relevant experienceand past performance;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) Reviewing the degree of capability and interest of the offerorto undertake the project in light of other work planned or in process;and</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(3) Examining such matters as_</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(a) Plant capacities;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(b) Management and technical capability of personnel;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(c) Availability of existing facilities, both Government-owned andcontractor-owned;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(d) Adequacy of accounting practices and cost controls;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(e) Adequacy of estimating systems; and</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(f) Ability to forecast and meet program schedules.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="71">2. Written and/or Oral Discussions</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">a. Except as provided in FAR 15.610(a), the contracting officer shallconduct written and/or oral discussions with all responsible offerors inthe competitive range. If, however, a decision is made in accordance withFAR 15.610(a)(3) to award without conducting written and/or oral discussionsupon the completion of the initial evaluation, the SEB Chairperson shallforward a letter to the SSO for approval presenting a summary of the evaluationresults. Upon SSO approval, the contracting officer shall undertake tocomplete all actions necessary to award the contract, without discussionsor negotiations, to the offeror submitting the lowest overall cost proposal.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">b. Written and/or oral discussions shall be conducted in accordancewith FAR 15.610 (with the exception of FAR 15.610(c)(2)) and NFS 1815.613-71(b)(5).Preparation for written and/or oral discussions should include, but notbe limited to, the establishment of the following:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(1) The time(s) and place(s) for conducting discussions. This requiresestablishment of the order of discussions with offerors. When feasible,the order should be established alphabetically or by lot. When discussionsare to be at offeror's plants or offices it may be that geographic dispersionwill be the deciding factor. The objective is impartiality.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) Topics for discussion. This will include preparation and issuanceof written questions common to all offerors, as well as those that arepeculiar to individual offerors, allowing adequate time for developmentof responses by offerors.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(3) The Government team that will conduct the discussions. The contractingofficer, in concert with the SEB Chairperson, will designate appropriateprocurement, pricing, and technical personnel for the Government team inaddition to identifying the individuals specified in the offeror's proposalrequested to be present for the discussions.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">c. The contracting officer, in concert with or on behalf of the SEB,will conduct written and/or oral discussions of the effort to be accomplishedand the cost or price of the effort with all offerors determined to bewithin the competitive range. The discussions are intended to assist theSEB_</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(1) In understanding fully each offeror's proposal and its strengthsand weaknesses based upon the individual efforts of each offeror;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) In assuring that the intent and the points of emphasis of RFPprovisions have been adequately conveyed to the offerors so that all offerorsare competing equally on the basis intended by the Government;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(3) In evaluating the personnel proposed by each offeror; and</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(4) In presenting a report to the SSO that makes the discriminatorsidentified among proposals clear and visible.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">d. In cost-reimbursement type contracts and all research and developmentcontracts, the contracting officer shall point out instances where themeaning of some aspect of a proposal is not clear and instances in whichsome aspects of the proposal failed to include substantiation for a proposedapproach, solution, or cost estimate. However, where the meaning of a proposalis clear and the SEB has sufficient information to assess its validityand the proposal contains a weakness that is inherent in an offeror's management,engineering, or scientific judgment or which is the result of its own lackof competence or inventiveness in preparing its proposal, the contractingofficer shall not point out the weaknesses. The possibility that such discussionsmay lead an offeror to discover that it has a weakness is not a reasonfor failing to inquire into a matter where the meaning is not clear orwhere insufficient information is available, since understanding of themeaning and validity of the proposed approaches, solutions, and cost estimatesis essential to a sound selection. Offerors should not be informed of therelative strengths or weaknesses of their proposals in relation to thoseof other offerors. To do so would be contrary to regulations which prohibitthe use of auction techniques (see FAR 15.610(d)(3)). In the course ofdiscussions, Government participants should be careful not to transmitinformation which could give leads to one offeror as to how its proposalmay be improved or which could reveal a competitor's ideas.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">e. In fixed-price type contracts other than for research and development,the specifications ordinarily describe the Government's requirements withmore particularity than is possible in cost reimbursement or research anddevelopment contracting, so that less emphasis is placed on an offeror'sintroduction of scientific, engineering, and management innovations. Thecontracting officer, in written and/or oral discussions, shall point outinstances in which some aspect of a proposal contains a weakness in relationto the Government's requirements. However, the contracting officer shallneither point out the relative strengths or weaknesses of a proposal inrelation to those of other offerors nor transmit information which couldgive leads to one offeror as to how its proposal may be improved or whichcould reveal a competitor's ideas. The contracting officer shall pointout price elements that do not appear to be justified and shall encourageofferors to put forward their most favorable price proposals, but shallnot discuss, disclose, or compare price elements of any other offeror. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">f. Although unusual, if the SEB and the contracting officer, afterconducting written and/or oral discussions, determine that a proposal nolonger has a reasonable chance of being selected for contract award, theproposal can be eliminated from the competitive range in accordance withFAR 15.609(b). The contracting officer shall notify the unsuccessful offerorin writing that its proposal is no longer eligible for award.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">g. If, after conclusion of written and/or oral discussions, the SEBconsiders that the evaluation findings thus far completed are not sufficientlycomprehensive for the SSO to make a decision, it may be prudent and necessaryto conduct further discussions or final negotiations with those offerorsremaining in the competitive range prior to presentation of the findingsto the SSO. This course of action must be considered as an exception tothe SEB process and therefore may be accomplished only with the approvalof the Assistant Administrator for Procurement. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="71">3. Best and Final Offers (BAFO's)  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">a. The contracting officer will issue to all offerors still withinthe competitive range a request for Best and Final Offers (BAFO's) in accordancewith FAR 15.611. Oral requests for BAFO's shall be confirmed in writing. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">b. A common cutoff date and time that allows each offeror a reasonableopportunity to support and clarify its proposal through submission of awritten BAFO shall be established. An offeror may, on its own initiative,revise its proposal and make corrections or improvements until the establishedcutoff date.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">c. Offerors should be cautioned to provide supporting documentationfor any changes to their prior offers. Any revision received after theestablished common cutoff date must be considered late in accordance withFAR 15.412.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">d. The cutoff date must be such as to permit adequate time for allofferors to submit revised proposals; particular care must be taken toensure that there is no compression of time for the offeror with whom discussionswere last held, i.e., if 2 weeks is adequate time for submission, thenthe time allowed should be 2 weeks from the date of last discussions. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="71">4. Evaluation Findings  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">a. After consideration of all committee reports, information receivedfrom offerors through plant visits, written and/or oral discussions, andBAFO's, the SEB shall conduct a final evaluation of proposals.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">b. The final evaluation must build on the SEB's earlier recorded findings.The purpose of the final evaluation is to determine the effects, if any,of discussions and BAFO's on the SEB's earlier Mission Suitability scoresand adjectival ratings as well as on the initial evaluation of Cost, RelevantExperience and Past Performance, and Other Considerations. Therefore, aclear and logical audit trail shall be maintained for the rationale forchanges in ratings and scores, including a detailed account of the SEBdecisions leading to the final ratings and scores.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">c. The final evaluation must represent the collective judgment ofthe SEB regarding its assessment of the offerors for each factor evaluatedincluding its assessment of the Mission Suitability subfactors, elements,if any, and its associated ratings, scores, and findings. The adjectivalratings and numerical scores shall reflect the strengths, weaknesses, anddiscriminators the SEB finds in the proposals. In this way, the reasonsfor differences in adjectival ratings, numerical scores, and findings canreadily be explained to and understood by the SSO.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">d. All significant SEB evaluation findings shall be fully documentedand incorporated into a written report which will serve as the basis forthe selection decision by the SSO. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="74">Chapter 5_Source Evaluation Board Report and Presentation </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">500 General </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">This Chapter describes the requirements for the written report andoral presentation to the SSO. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">501 Responsibilities and Procedures </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1. The SEB shall prepare a written report of its findings, signedby the Chairperson and all voting members of the SEB. It shall presentits written report and make an accompanying oral presentation to the SSO.Guidelines for the written report and the oral presentation are set forthin Appendix C. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="71">2. SEB Preliminary Presentation (Dry Run) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">a. When the Administrator is the SSO, a preliminary presentation shouldbe made to the Field Installation Director and to the Official-in-Chargeof the cognizant Headquarters Program Office. When the Official-in-Chargeof the cognizant Headquarters Program Office is the SSO, a preliminarypresentation should be made to the Field Installation Director and thecognizant Headquarters Deputy Program/Staff Associate Administrator orthe official responsible for the specific project. The dry run presentationis the same presentation prepared for the SSO. Attendance at the dry runshall be restricted to those personnel who are involved in the selectionprocess or who have a valid need-to-know. For Headquarters dry runs, anattendance list will be issued by the SEB coordinator in the Office ofProcurement (Code HS). Admittance to the dry run will be restricted tothose individuals whose names appear on the attendance list. However changesproposed 24 hours before the presentation will be considered. Persons noton the list will not be admitted without the prior authorization of theSEB coordinator. For field installation dry runs, the attendance list willbe prepared by a designee of the Procurement Officer. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">b. The following personnel or designees should attend the Headquartersdry run presentation: </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(1) Cognizant program/staff officials. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) Official-in-Charge of the cognizant Headquarters Program Officein those cases when the Administrator serves as the SSO. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(3) NASA Comptroller. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(4) Assistant Administrator for Procurement and/or Deputy AssistantAdministrator for Procurement. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(5) General Counsel and/or Associate General Counsel (Contracts).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(6) Associate Administrator for Safety, Reliability, Maintainability,and Quality Assurance, when SRMandamp;QA matters are involved. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(7) Field Installation Director. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(8) Field Installation Chief Counsel. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(9) Selected voting and nonvoting ex officio SEB members (no designees).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(10) Field Installation Procurement Officer. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(11) Headquarters procurement personnel responsible for support tothe Headquarters cognizant Program/Staff Office. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(12) Other personnel as approved by the Official-in-Charge of thecognizant Headquarters Program Office and the Office of Procurement (CodeHS). </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">c. The SEB Chairperson or designee is responsible for arranging andcoordinating the SEB dry run with the SEB coordinator. The SEB dry runshould take place far enough in advance of the presentation to the SSOto allow for changes or revisions to the presentation material, if necessary.The material used during the dry run presentation is considered to be ``SEBSensitive'' and should be treated accordingly. Consequently, the SEB Chairpersonis responsible for providing a projectionist, who has been SEB cleared,to present the material for both presentations. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">d. The dry run presentation, as well as the presentation to the SSO,will ordinarily be made by the SEB Chairperson; however, if another officialhas been designated to make the final presentation to the SSO, that personshall also make the dry run presentation. The SEB presentation materialshall be delivered to the SEB coordinator for control and distributionno later than 7 working days before the scheduled dry run presentationdate. The SEB presentation material includes 10 copies of the SEB reportand charts. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="71">3. SEB Formal Presentation </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">a. The SEB shall present its evaluation findings to the SSO as thebasis for a sound selection decision. This formal presentation should beattended by the same personnel or designees in attendance at the dry run,with the exception of the inclusion of the SSO at the formal presentation.Continuity of attendees assures a more efficient formal presentation inaddition to limiting access to SEB sensitive data. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">b. The cognizant procurement analyst in the Procurement OperationsDivision (Code HS) will function as the SEB coordinator and will performcoordination functions for the formal presentation when the Administratoror the Official-in-Charge of the cognizant Headquarters Program Officeserves as the SSO. These functions include arranging the time and placeof the presentation; assuring, with the concurrence of the appropriatepersonnel in the Office of the Administrator, proper attendance; and distributingSEB reports and graphic material. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">4. The designated individuals to whom the SEB presentation(s) (dryrun and final) are made will be responsible for ensuring that_</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">a. The requirements of this handbook and all applicable agency policieshave been complied with in the solicitation and evaluation processes; </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">b. The written report and presentation accurately convey SEB activitiesand findings; </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">c. The oral presentation is arranged and conducted in a professionalmanner; it is complete and informative; and it can be concisely presentedwithin the time allocated by the SSO; and </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">d. No changes (1) to established evaluation factors, subfactors, elements,weights, or scoring systems or (2) in the substance of the SEB's findingsshall be made. They may, however, direct the SEB to reconvene to rectifyprocedural omissions, irregularities or inconsistencies, substantiate itsfindings, or revise the organization of the written report and/or the methodof presentation. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">5. All copies of the SEB reports and presentation material containsensitive business information in addition to ``SEB Sensitive'' data andshall be adequately safeguarded throughout the source selection process.Physical safeguarding of sensitive data includes, but is not limited to_</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">a. Controlling the number of copies of proposals and SEB reports;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">b. Restricting access to SEB work areas; </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">c.

The SSO shall use the evaluation factors, subfactors, and elementsset forth in the solicitation to make the source selection decision. TheSSO shall consider the SEB findings and the advice provided by cognizantline and staff management at the conclusion of the SEB presentation indetermining which of the proposals submitted in response to the solicitationwould prove most advantageous to the Government, all factors considered.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. In accordance with NASA policy and FAR 15.613, upon source selectionby the SSO, the contracting officer will proceed with negotiations leadingto award of contract(s). </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">602 Notice and Debriefing for Unsuccessful Offerors</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1. a. When a proposal is no longer to be considered for contract award,the offeror will be promptly notified by the contracting officer, in writing,together, with a general, brief explanation of the major reasons in accordancewith FAR 15.1001 and NFS 1815.613-71(b)(7). There are, generally, fivepoints in the SEB process when it may be determined that a proposal isno longer to be considered for contract award: </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(1) After determination that stated qualification standards, if any,have not been satisfactorily met. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) After identification of an unacceptable proposal in accordancewith subparagraph 406.5 of this handbook. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(3) After determination of the competitive range resulting from theinitial evaluation of proposals. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(4) After written and/or oral discussions resulting in a determinationthat a proposal does not stand a reasonable chance of being selected foraward. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(5) After the selection decision by the Source Selection Official.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">b. In the first four instances, the notice shall state that a revisionof the proposal will not be considered. Post-selection notices shall beissued in accordance with FAR 15.1001(c) and 15.1002. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. If any offeror requests a debriefing in writing, the offeror shallbe formally debriefed and furnished the basis for the selection decisionafter the final source selection decision by the SSO. This debriefing shouldnormally take place prior to contract award and be conducted in accordancewith NMI 5103.1, ``Debriefing of Unsuccessful Companies in CompetitiveNegotiated Procurements.'' If the situation will not permit delaying theaward in order to debrief unsuccessful offerors, the debriefing may beconducted after award. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">603 Source Selection Statement </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1. When the final source selection decision has been made by the SSO,a Source Selection Statement shall be prepared for the SSO's signaturein a manner releasable to the competing offerors and the general public,if requested. When the Administrator or an Official-in-Charge of a HeadquartersProgram Office is the SSO, the Statement will be prepared by the Officeof General Counsel. Source Selection Statements prepared at the field installationshould be drafted by the Field Installation Chief Counsel or designee.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. Source Selection Statements must describe the procurement; theSEB evaluation procedures; the substance of the Mission Suitability evaluation;evaluation of the Cost factor, Relevant Experience and Past Performancefactor, and Other Considerations factor involved in reaching the selectiondecision. There should be coverage of unacceptable proposals, the competitiverange determination, late proposals, or any other pertinent considerationsapplicable to the specific decision. It must be stressed that nothing cansubstitute for the use of good judgment. The Source Selection Statementmust be self-sufficient and must reveal sound rationale for the selectionclearly and succinctly, without revealing the scores involved, the proposedprices, or any other confidential business information. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">3. Source Selection Statements shall be signed as soon as practicableafter the final selection is made. The SSO may desire to have one or morekey officials who participated in the selection decision concur on theSource Selection Statement prior to final signature. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">4. As indicated in subparagraph 1, Source Selection Statements generallymay be released to competing offerors and the general public; however,it is anticipated that the Statement will not always be available in finalform or signed by the Source Selection Official at the time of debriefingof unsuccessful offerors. A draft of the decision portion of the Statementthat has been reviewed by the SSO or a concurring official should be availableto the designated Debriefing Official for guidance at the debriefing. Inorder to avoid any misunderstanding, the Source Selection Statement rationalecontained in the draft Statement should have the approval of the SSO ora concurring official prior to any debriefing(s). This will enable NASAto demonstrate, for the record, that the SSO's selection rationale wasnot modified substantially (editorial changes can be made) as a resultof the debriefings. If requested by an offeror a copy of the final SourceSelection Statement will be furnished to the offeror when it is signedby the SSO, subject to the provisions of subparagraph 5. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">5. a. Under some situations, multiple selections are made for thepurpose of permitting a design or other competition to continue until afinal selection is made for a single contractor to undertake full-scaledevelopment. Stating the strengths and weaknesses in the Source SelectionStatement in these cases may result in the premature disclosure of innovativeconcepts, designs, and approaches. Release of these Selection Statementsto competing offerors or the general public prior to final selection ofconcept(s) or contractor(s) for full-scale development could compromisethe integrity of the competition by making possible a transfusion of ideaswhich could also inhibit offerors during the early phase from offeringtheir best and most promising ideas for meeting the mission need.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">b. Accordingly, unless prior approval is obtained through the HeadquartersProcurement Operations Division (Code HS) with the concurrence of the Officeof General Counsel, Source Selection Statements for the selection of alternativesystem design concepts subject to NMI 7100.14, ``Major System Acquisitions,''are not to be released to competing offerors or the general public, ifrequested, prior to the release of the Source Selection Statement for full-scaledevelopment.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">c. A similar problem may occur in other procurements where competitioncontinues but is not covered under NMI 7100.14, ``Major System Acquisitions.''When possible, care should be taken to set forth the strengths and weaknessesand other information in a manner that will avoid this problem. However,if this is not feasible, the Statement should not be released except inaccordance with the procedures of the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C.552. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">604 Multiple Selection Decisions </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1. While SEB procedures contemplate that the SSO will be in a positionto select a single source for final contract negotiations subsequent tothe SEB presentation, a variety of considerations may lead the SSO to directthat contract negotiations be conducted with two or more offerors. Suchnegotiations are to result in complete contract documents signed by theofferors which may be accepted by the agency upon final selection of thesuccessful offeror by the SSO. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. The SEB shall consult with the SSO, the contracting officer, andthe negotiating team regarding negotiation positions, objectives, and informationto be obtained during negotiations to assist the SEB in making its finalevaluation and report after the negotiations. The objectives of negotiationsare essentially the same as those where a single offeror has been selectedfor final contract negotiation and award; each offeror's correctable weaknessesshould be pointed out and corrected during negotiations, using whatevertechnical and other information is known and which the Government has theright to use. Similarly, negotiations should be conducted to result ina fair and reasonable cost or price. Particular attention shall be givento any instructions which the SSO may have given when he/she directed themultiple contract negotiations. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">3. The final contract negotiation process differs from the writtenand oral discussions previously held with offerors in the competitive range.Discussions have the specific function of obtaining information for evaluationand selection purposes, while the final contract negotiations have theadditional function of presenting that information in contractually bindingform. For this reason, it is essential that each offeror be brought tothe most favorable terms that the negotiation process can produce, includingtechnical and scientific approaches, management arrangements, and estimatedcosts (or fixed prices where applicable). The prohibition against auctiontechniques in FAR 15.610(d)(3) is equally applicable to these negotiations.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">4. Upon completion of the negotiations and agreement on contract terms,the SEB shall conduct a final evaluation, focusing on a comparative analysisof the contracts negotiated, their relative strengths and remaining weaknesses,their estimated costs and fee(s)/prices and probable costs, and any otherfactors that might influence the selection. The evaluation must build onthe SEB's earlier report and presentation to the SSO which resulted inthe decision to have multiple contract negotiations conducted. The evaluationis to determine the effects, if any, of the contract negotiations on theSEB's earlier final Mission Suitability scores as well as on evaluationof Cost, Relevant Experience and Past Performance, and Other Considerations;however, an arithmetic rescoring is not to be accomplished. A summary ofthe results of the evaluation shall be prepared for presentation to theSSO including any changes in the SEB's assessment of each proposal. Therevisions may be expressed in a narrative analysis including an appropriateadjectival rating. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">5. a. Upon completing its evaluation of the results of contract negotiations,the SEB shall report its findings to the SSO. This is to be accomplishedby oral presentation and supplemental written report. When the Administratoris serving as the SSO, this should be preceded by preliminary presentationsto the Field Installation Director and to the Official-in-Charge of thecognizant Headquarters Program Office.   </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">b. The report and presentation shall include the following:   </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(1) A summary review of the previous report and presentation.   </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) A brief discussion of significant weaknesses and strengths ofthe companies involved, as reported and presented in the previous reportand presentation, with emphasis on key dis-criminators, if any.   </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(3) A discussion of how any instructions given by the Source SelectionOfficial were carried out.   </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(4) The results of the negotiation, and the impact, if any, on theSEB's findings and conclusions in the previous report, including MissionSuitability, Cost, Relevant Experience and Past Performance, and OtherConsiderations, as appropriate.   </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(5) Discussions of any matters or areas of substance that arose duringthe negotiations and that were not present in the proposals or the earlieroral and/or written discussions or BAFO's.   </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">6. The contracting officer should be present and should participate,as appropriate, in the presentation to the SSO. The contracting officeror designee will bring to the presentation copies of the contracts signedby the offerors.    </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="74">Appendix A to Appendix I of 1870.303_Sample Letter of Designation</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">TO:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">FROM:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">SUBJECT: Source Evaluation Board (SEB) for <T2>XXXX</T2> </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Pursuant to Chapter 2 of the NASA Source Evaluation Board Handbook(NHB 5103.6), I hereby designate the following individuals to serve asmembers of the SEB for the purpose of evaluating proposals received inresponse to the solicitation for <T2>XXXXXX</T2>:  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">Chairperson:  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Name of individual, functional title, and organizational assignment. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">Other Voting Members:  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Names of individuals, functional titles, and organizational assignments. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">SEB Recorder:  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Name, functional title, and organizational assignment.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">Nonvoting Ex Officio Members:  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Name, functional title, and organizational assignment.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The SEB will conduct its business in strict accordance with the provisionsof the SEB handbook.

The SEB Chairperson is normally responsiblefor conducting the presentation to the SSO. It is the Chairperson's functionto convey concisely and accurately the results of the SEB deliberationsto permit an informed and objective selection of the best source for theparticular procurement. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">b. As a general rule, the SEB Chairperson's prepared oral presentationshould not exceed an hour to be followed by a question and answer period.Copies of the viewgraphs to supplement the SEB report forwarded to theSSO are to be available to those attending the oral presentation. Relevantbackup material is to also be available at the presentation. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">c. The main thrust of the oral presentation is to focus upon issuesand problems identified by the SEB's findings and to highlight the reasonablealternative choices available to the SSO. This presentation must includean explanation of any applicable qualification standards; evaluation factors,subfactors, and elements; the major strengths and weaknesses of the offerors;the Government estimate, if applicable; the offerors' proposed cost/price;the probable cost; the proposed fee arrangements; the results of writtenand/or oral discussions; the BAFO's; the final evaluation findings; andthe final adjectival ratings and scores. These aspects of the report arecentral to its meaning, and must be reviewed in the oral presentation despitethe redundancy to the written report. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">d. The presentation shall clearly indicate any discriminators. Thisrequires the presentation of scores in enough detail to provide an adequatebasis for the SSO to assess the validity of the judgments made by the SEB.This detail shall extend at least to all levels of subfactors and numericallyscored elements. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">e. A suggested progression of charts follows. Brevity and understandabilityare key. Charts should highlight the significant aspects of the comprehensivewritten report. They should prompt discussion. Sample charts are not includedin this handbook since these tend to lead toward unnecessary or even inappropriatestandardization. As appropriate, the Assistant Administrator for Procurementwill, from time to time, disseminate sample charts illustrative of approachesor techniques of exceptional merit and usefulness.   </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(1) <T3>Identification of the Procurement. </T3>This chart should identifythe installation, the nature of the services or hardware to be procured,some quantitative measure including the Government estimate for the procurement,and the kind of contractual arrangement planned. Detailed objectives ofthe procurement should be avoided.   </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) <T3>Background. </T3>This item is useful to identify any earlier phasesof a phased procurement or, as in the case of continuing support services,to identify the incumbent and any consolidations or proposed changes fromthe existing structure.   </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(3) <T3>Evaluation Factors, Subfactors, and Elements. </T3>An explanation ofany qualification standards and the   evaluation factors, subfactors, and,if utilized, elements, along with assigned weights, is an important partof any presentation of SEB findings. The relative order of importance ofthe evaluation factors and, within Mission Suitability, the numerical weightsof the subfactors and, if utilized, numerically scored elements shouldalso be presented. The adjectival scoring system utilized as an aid inevaluation of Mission Suitability should be presented.   </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(4) <T3>Sources. </T3>This chart will indicate the number of potential offerorssolicited, the number of potential offerors expressing interest, e.g.,attendance at a preproposal conference, and the identification of offerorssubmitting proposals in response to the solicitation. Small businesses,small disadvantaged businesses, and women-owned businesses can be identifiedhere. In addition, a chart must be included for each offeror indicatingthe Chief Executive Officer, the location of the offeror, some representativeproducts, and similar information for each major subcontractor proposed.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(5) <T3>Summary of Findings. </T3>The summary chart shall, as simply as possible,list the initial Mission Suitability ratings and scores, the final MissionSuitability ratings and scores, the offerors' proposed costs/prices, andthe SEB's assessment of the probable costs. In addition, any clear   discriminator,problem, or issue which could have an effect upon the selection shouldbe introduced at this time. The determination of competitive range mustbe addressed here.   </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(6) <T3>Strengths and Weaknesses of Offerors. </T3>These charts can be amongthe most valuable presented, and its preparation could initially assistthe SEB Chairperson in distilling the essence of the SEB's findings. Certainguidelines should be followed in the preparation of these charts:   </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(a) Only the major strengths and weaknesses of individual offerorsshould be selected for presentation. The significance of strengths andweaknesses is lost when exhibited in long lists without distinction asto importance.   </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(b) The strengths and weaknesses should be directly related to theevaluation factors, subfactors, and elements.   </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(c) Strengths and weaknesses should be as clear as charting techniquesand limitations will permit. Care should be taken to avoid an analysisof strengths and weaknesses based totally on numerical scores. This practicelimits the SEB and the SSO in their evaluation and selection. For example,not   all major weaknesses could be considered of equal value_some arecorrectable during negotiations and some are not.   </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(d) It is important to indicate the significance of major weaknesses.Can they be corrected during negotiations? If so, at what cost?   </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(e) The results and impact, if any, of written and/or oral discussionsand BAFO's on ratings and scores must be clearly indicated.   </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(f) Key personnel charts must be included in the presentation, providinga list of the key personnel for each offeror together with, as appropriate,their educational background, general background, and any pertinent detailsapplicable to this procurement.   </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(7) <T3>Final Mission Suitability Ratings and Scores. </T3>This chart is tosummarize, as simply as the material will permit, the evaluation subfactorsand elements, the maximum points achievable, and the scores of the offerorsin the competitive range.   </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(8) <T3>Final Cost Evaluation. </T3>This chart summarizes probable costs associatedwith each offeror including   proposed fee arrangements. The data shouldbe as accurate as possible; therefore, SEB adjustments to achieve comparabilityshould be shown. Further, the presentation of this chart should includethe measure of confidence the SEB has in the costs of the individual offerors,noting the reasons for low or high confidence.   </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(9) <T3>Relevant Experience and Past Performance. </T3>This chart should reflectthe summary conclusions. This information is to be supported and amplifiedby specific case data with particular emphasis on exemplary or inferiorperformance and its potential bearing on the instant procurement.   </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(10) <T3>Other Considerations. </T3>This chart lists and discusses the OtherConsiderations addressed in the RFP, providing an appropriate adjectivalrating for each of the Other Considerations subfactors.   </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(11) <T3>Special Interest. </T3>This chart should include only information ofspecial interest to the SSO that has not been discussed elsewhere, e.g.,procedural errors or other matters that could have an effect on the selectiondecision.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="40">[FR Doc. 89-15645Filed 7-5-89; 8:45 am]</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 0000-00-M                                                                                                                                                                                                                 </ITAG></ITAG></ITAG></ITAG></TEXT></DOC>
