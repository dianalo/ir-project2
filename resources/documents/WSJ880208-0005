The nation's largest airline holding company said it would cleave the highly profitable East Coast shuttle operation from its unprofitable Eastern Airlines and place it in a newly created Texas Air unit. Although the internal transaction should be invisible to passengers, the sale would push the shuttle's big profits directly into Texas Air and escalate a bitter confrontation with organized labor at Eastern.    In fact, Texas Air blamed the &quot;severe impact&quot; of Eastern's &quot;labor difficulties&quot; for much of the parent company's fourth-quarter net loss of $265.7 million, and for its 1987 loss of $466.15 million -- one of the worst annual losses in airline history.    The wider-than-expected deficits also were caused by losses at Continental Airlines, Texas Air's huge debt costs and other factors.    Texas Air said the sale of the hourly New York-Boston-Washington shuttle is intended to pump cash into long-ailing Eastern. But frantic union officials claimed that the sale, occurring in the midst of contract negotiations with machinists and baggage handlers, was designed to increase the strength of Frank Lorenzo, the chairman of Texas Air, in the tug-of-war over labor costs that he began after acquiring Eastern in 1986.    As early as December, the pilots union warned Eastern that it would call for a strike vote if the shuttle operations were sold. In addition to a walkout, the pilots union was considering a buy-out. Officials said the union had been in contact with T. Boone Pickens Jr. about the possible purchase of Eastern. &quot;These are very preliminary talks, embryonic really,&quot; said Ronald Russell, a pilots union leader. And without the shuttle, he added, &quot;Eastern is not a very marketable product.&quot; An aide to Mr. Pickens declined to comment.    But some union leaders said their most powerful weapon was probably in the courts, where they will invoke a federal court injunction that thwarted Eastern's attempt to create a new, nonunion ground-services subsidiary last year. A Texas Air spokesman said the court order was irrelevant to the shuttle transaction.    While increasing the likelihood of a strike, the shuttle sale could make a work stoppage less effective. Already, Eastern's reservation system has been sold to Texas Air, and the operating certificates for Eastern's profitable Latin American routes permit their possible transfer to Continental. &quot;They could shut Eastern down,&quot; Richard Bilotti, a bond analyst at L.F. Rothschild andamp; Co., said of Eastern's union. &quot;But really, does Frank Lorenzo care at this point?&quot;    In addition, the shuttle sale would infuse Eastern with funds that could cushion the carrier if the current contract talks collapse into a strike -- $125 million in cash, plus $100 million in 10-year, marketable notes. The terms allow for the newly created subsidiary, called Air-Shuttle, to lease 17 Eastern aircraft, providing Eastern with an additional $145 million over seven years. The transaction, which requires regulatory approval, is expected to be final in April.    If the transaction is intended as a union-busting move, it wasn't immediately apparent in the new unit's employment policies. Texas Air said it will offer the 800 available shuttle jobs exclusively to Eastern's 32,500 employees in order of seniority. If more than half of each job class is filled by Eastern employees, they will continue to be represented by their Eastern unions, Texas Air said.    But union officials point out that their contract is with Eastern -- not Air-Shuttle -- perhaps giving Mr. Lorenzo the opportunity to declare in the future that the new unit isn't bound by any contracts signed by Eastern. In addition, they said, Texas Air could dilute the work force with outsiders. &quot;It doesn't stretch the imagination,&quot; said J.B. Stokes, an Eastern pilot.    Although the shuttle sale wouldn't affect operations, Texas Air did succeed in scoring a coup over its main shuttle competitor, Pan Am Corp. Bruce R. Nobles, Pan Am's chairman of shuttle operations, resigned Friday from that post and joined Texas Air's new unit as its president.    &quot;I know how strong Eastern's shuttle has been, and what a strong competitor it is,&quot; Mr. Nobles said yesterday. Analysts say that although it represents only 4% of Eastern's annual revenue, its operating profit is three times greater than Eastern's other system operations.    Although Texas Air's cash position has been sliding of late -- to about $800 million at year's end from $1.5 billion as recently as 1986 -- a costly labor confrontation would come when Texas Air is relatively unencumbered financially. Under the company's debt-maturity schedule, debt payments and capital lease obligations this year will total only $300 million, more than covered by its $500 million in depreciation.    The turbulence of Texas Air's spate of acquisitions last year was evident in its financial statements. The fourth-quarter loss of $265.6 million, compared with profit a year earlier of $21.7 million, or 26 cents a share, including a $12 million gain for tax-loss carry-forwards. On an operating basis -- including contributions from the reservation system and other parent-company activities, but excluding interest expense and certain charges -- Texas Air had a pretax operating loss of $82.1 million, compared with an operating profit of $91 million a year earlier.    Revenue in the quarter rose 28% to $2.08 billion from $1.63 billion.    The full-year net loss of $466.1 million, compared with 1986 profit of $72.7 million, or $1.75 a share, including a $30.5 million gain for tax-loss carry-forward. Pretax operating profit fell to $143.8 million from $236.3 million a year earlier. Revenue doubled to $8.47 billion from $4.41 billion. </TEXT></DOC>
