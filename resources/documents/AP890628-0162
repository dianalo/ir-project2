The report by the National Association of Latino Elected andAppointed Officials released this week said 39.4 percent of allHispanic children were living in poverty, $11,611 for a family offour, in 1987.   ``Moreover, the increasing growth of the Hispanic population, acommunity which has increased by 30 percent from 1980 to 1987, inaddition to the relative youth of the community, compounds analready alarming situation,'' the report said. ``Simply stated,significant numbers of Hispanic children constitute a population atrisk.''   While Hispanic children comprise approximately 10 percent of allchildren in the United States, they represent 27 percent of allchildren in poverty, the report said.   ``Yet the unique needs of Hispanic children in poverty continueto be overlooked by the nation's federal policy-makers, civilaffairs researchers, and the media,'' the report said.   The nation's Hispanic population jumped from 14.3 million in 1980to 17.5 million in 1985 through a combination of high birth ratesand international migration, according to Census Bureau estimatesreleased last week.   Although they were only 6.3 percent of the U.S. population in1980, Hispanics made up about one-fourth of the 12 million nationalpopulation increase during the next half-decade, the Census Bureausaid.   Rep. Albert Bustamante, D-Texas, said he believes the povertyrate for Hispanic children could exceed 40 percent in many areas.   Bustamante said today's Hispanic children will make up one-thirdof the work force in the 21st century, but he is concerned they willnot have the skills and education needed to provide the services andtaxes the country will need as the population ages.   NALEO's report is based is based on the First National Conferenceon Latino Children in Poverty, held in July 1987 and sponsored bythe NALEO Education Fund. Attending were university researchers,public policy-makers and service providers.</TEXT></DOC>
