Mrs. Helmsley, 69 years old, listened stoically as the verdict was read. She was acquitted of the most serious charge, conspiring to commit extortion, and of seven counts of mail fraud.    Mrs. Helmsley wouldn't answer questions from reporters after the verdict. As she left the federal courthouse, where about 400 people waited outside, she tossed her jacket to a bodyguard and walked down the steps to a waiting car.    The jury also convicted Mrs. Helmsley's two co-defendants, former Helmsley employees Frank J. Turco and Joseph V. Licari, on 33 counts of conspiring to defraud the U.S., mail fraud, and aiding Mrs. Helmsley in tax evasion and the filing of false returns. The government charged that the two men were instrumental in helping Mrs. Helmsley and her husband, Harry, cheat the U.S. out of $1.2 million in personal income taxes from 1983 through 1985. Mr. Turco also was acquitted of conspiring to commit extortion. In addition, the two men were acquitted of seven counts of mail fraud.    The charges stemmed from the fraudulent billing of millions of dollars in personal expenses -- mainly for work on the Helmsley's Connecticut estate -- to Helmsley companies. The prosecutors charged that the fraud also allowed the companies to lower their taxes because the personal charges were deducted as business expenses.    Mr. Helmsley was named as a defendant in the case, but U.S. Judge John M. Walker found that the 80-year-old real-estate magnate was mentally unfit to stand trial.    Sentencing is scheduled for Nov. 14. Because the crimes occurred before November 1987, Mrs. Helmsley won't face mandatory jail time under the new federal sentencing guidelines.    Many judges, however, stay close to the guidelines even for such cases, known as &quot;old law&quot; cases. If Judge Walker applies the guidelines to Mrs. Helmsley's case, she would face a sentence of 21 to 27 months based on the crimes committed and the taxes evaded, said Benson B. Weintraub, a Miami criminal defense lawyer, who is chairman of the sentencing committee of the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers.    But, Mr. Weintraub said, &quot;In white-collar crime cases, I have noted a tendency of judges ruling in old-law cases to apply less severe sentences than those prescribed under the guidelines.&quot;    Mr. Weintraub said a judge's sentencing decision in high-profile cases like Mrs. Helmsley's &quot;ultimately comes down to a matter of public perception and whether the judge perceives a need to demonstrate a greater general deterrence principle.&quot;    If sentenced to jail, Mrs. Helmsley would likely serve time in one of a few federal minimum-security prison camps for women. The two closest to New York City are in Alderson, W.Va., and Danbury, Conn.    Greg Bogdan, a spokesman for the federal Bureau of Prisons, said that in assigning convicts to a prison, &quot;we do try to keep individuals as near to their release destination and their family as possible.&quot;    The prison camps at Alderson and Danbury have no fences and have recreation areas and educational programs. Mr. Bogdan said the camp at Alderson offers business education and business mathematics courses.    Mrs. Helmsley, president of Helmsley Hotels Inc., also faces a maximum fine of about $7 million. A separate lawsuit against Mrs. Helmsley and her husband is pending in New York state court alleging state tax violations. And the Internal Revenue Service could file a civil suit seeking payment of the federal taxes owed plus interest and penalties.    Mrs. Helmsley's attorney, Gerald Feffer, wouldn't comment on the verdict except to say that it will be appealed. Appeals also are planned by attorneys for Mr. Turco, who was Mrs. Helmsley's right-hand man at the hotel company, and Mr. Licari, formerly chief financial officer of Helmsley Enterprises Inc., the hotel company's parent.    U.S. Attorney Benito Romano, whose office prosecuted the case, said, &quot;The verdict will encourage compliance by other taxpayers. . . . We are out there vigorously enforcing the tax laws.&quot; He added that the case &quot;should discourage the cynicism shared by many that the rich are above the law.&quot; U.S. officials said there were no efforts to settle the case before trial.    Jurors apparently rejected the defense's claim that the falsified bills were simply a way to circumvent the difficult Mrs. Helmsley, rather than a scheme to avoid taxes. Mr. Feffer had argued that the fake bills were the only way to get many of the expenses for the Connecticut estate paid, because Mrs. Helmsley was displeased with much of the work. Mr. Feffer also claimed that the Helmsleys honestly believed that their companies could deduct many of the personal expenses. </TEXT></DOC>
