Robert S. Bennett of Washington, D.C., was retained Friday to``assist in obtaining and analyzing additional information'' on thefive senators who met with federal regulators on behalf of thefailing Lincoln Savings and Loan _ after receiving campaigncontributions from the head of the thrift.   The committee said Bennett also will work on the case of Sen.Alfonse M. D'Amato, R-N.Y., accused in a complaint by a formerelection opponent of violating rules in the federal housing scandaland other matters.   Committee Chairman Howell Heflin, D-Ala., and Vice ChairmanWarren Rudman, R-N.H., said Bennett will ``assist the committee indetermining whether to proceed to a preliminary inquiry'' in bothmatters.   The preliminary proceeding is the first of three stages of aformal committee investigation, and Rudman said it could takeseveral months to decide whether this stage will be approved.   The hiring of Bennett ``does not suggest in any way that thecommittee has found any indication of wrongdoing, or that aviolation of any rule or law has occurred,'' the two senators saidin a statement.   All five in the savings and loan case have denied wrongdoing:Sens. Alan Cranston, D-Calif.; Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz.; JohnGlenn, D-Ohio; John McCain, R-Ariz., and Donald W. Riegle Jr.,D-Mich. So has D'Amato.   After the announcement, Glenn said it ``was expected,'' andD'Amato commented, ``Sure, let them do it. I'm not concerned.''Cranston said the outside counsel was ``not necessary'' but pledgedhis ``utmost cooperation.'' ``I am confident the outside counselwill concur with our view that my conduct was entirely proper,''Cranston added.   The five senators who met with regulators did so while bankinginvestigators were examining the collapsing Irvine, Calif., savingsinstitution in 1987. The chairman of the thrift, Charles H. KeatingJr., gave $1.3 million to the senators' campaigns or theirpolitical causes in the mid-1980s.   Riegle, DeConcini and Glenn also issued fresh declarations ofinnocence during the day.   The five men are among the most powerful in the Senate _ withCranston the No. 2 Democrat and Riegle and Glenn holding committeechairmanships.   Glenn told reporters he never discussed any deals for Keatingwhen participating in discussions with the Federal Home Loan BankBoard about Lincoln.   ``I do not recall that there was any deal whatsoever that wasever made. I was not party to any deal, did not agree to anydeal,'' said Glenn, chairman of the Senate Governmental AffairsCommittee.   DeConcini said, ```I'm prepared and we'll cooperate with theindependent counsel. If that's the decision of the committee, itwould be very positive to bring out all the facts related to the... charge.   ``I hope the independent counsel will expedite it, or rapidlybring it to conclusion,'' DeConcini said.   Riegle, the Senate Banking Committee chairman, commented, ``Istrongly support whatever level of inquiry the Senate EthicsCommittee feels is appropriate. Their review will show my conductin this matter to have been ethical and proper at all times.''</TEXT></DOC>
