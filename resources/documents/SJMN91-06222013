This is an instantly engaging,eminently accessible listen from start to finish. The disc just sails along ona wave of sweet harmonies and propulsive, mesmerizing rhythms. This isroad-trip music just begging for a long, straight desert highway and a fulltank of gas.;    Think of these guys as the grinning hitchhikers who persuadeyou to take off that tie, throw your computer in a rest-stop dumpster and keepdriving right past that sales seminar. Commercial radio will never gamble onthe M.P.s, but an adventurous mainstream rock listener looking for auser-friendly entree into the underground will not be disappointed.;    --David Plotnikoff;  Reissues; OTIS REDDING; &quot;The Soul Album&quot;; &quot;Otis Blue&quot;; &quot;TheOtis Redding Dictionary of Soul Complete andamp; Unbelievable&quot;; &quot;The Great OtisRedding Sings Soul Ballads&quot;; &quot;King and Queen&quot; (with Carla Thomas); (Atlantic;CD, cassette); (star)(star)(star)(star);  For years, the only way to get thesealbums from the mid-'60s was to hunt around for high-priced imports (assumingyour local record store carried them). But they're all available againdomestically as part of a series of 12 separately issued budget-priced CDs andcassettes. (We recently reviewed Sam andamp; Dave's &quot;Hold On, I'm Comin'.&quot;);   Until now, Otis fans have been limited to one CD collection, &quot;The UltimateOtis Redding&quot; (Warner Special Products). The four albums featuring justRedding add a healthy chunk to the Otis catalog. All are pretty muchinterchangeable and, for the most part, are composed of covers interspersedwith lesser-known originals. Redding sounds great on all of them.;    A minorquibble: Even though the &quot;Ultimate&quot; collection features half of the tracks,some duplicated on these albums, in stereo, all five albums are in mono.Assuming the stereo mixes were available, even using some stereo mixes (as wasdone on the &quot;Sam andamp; Dave&quot; album, where all but one track was in stereo), wouldhave been preferable. That said, the CDs still sound great and have a minimumof hiss.;    The Redding and Thomas album is a real gem. Redding soundsnoticeably looser than on the other albums, as he and Thomas bounce off eachother on the 11 tracks (all in stereo). They include the hilarious &quot;Tramp,&quot;plus their covers of &quot;Knock On Wood,&quot; &quot;Tell It Like It Is,&quot; &quot;It Takes Two&quot; and&quot;Bring It On Home to Me.&quot;;    The next step would be to reissue some ofRedding's exciting live albums, including &quot;Live in Europe,&quot; &quot;In Person at theWhiskey A Go Go&quot; and the outstanding Monterey Pop performance with JimiHendrix.;    That would be the &quot;ultimate&quot; Otis Redding.; -- Steve Marinucci; Country Blues; ROY ROGERS AND NORTON BUFFALO; &quot;Randamp;B&quot;; (Blind Pig); (star)(star)1/2; Travel with us now to yesteryear, say the late 1950s, when a bunch ofguys with acoustic guitars made a lot of money with folk music. Into the landmade tame by the Kingston Trio and Bud andamp; Travis now travel Roy Rogers andNorton Buffalo, with a nice new album of acoustic country blues.;    Buffalois known for his fine harmonica work, Rogers (whose business cards say &quot;Chops,Not Chaps&quot;) for being one of today's best slide guitarists (and for hisGrammy-winning work producing John Lee Hooker's &quot;The Healer&quot; album).;    Onthis album, Rogers' singing sounds better than ever, especially on the firsttune, &quot;So Much To Say and So Few Words.&quot; Buffalo has a wiry, muscular voicethat occasionally surprises you with some dips into the deep and soulful.;   The musicianship, arrangements and production work are excellent, which is nosurprise. &quot;When They Talk Like That,&quot; one of Buffalo's tunes, is just 2 1/2minutes long, and a thorough treat, with some impressive picking and harpblowing.;    The songwriting isn't consistent; some of it is kind of trite.&quot;You're gone with the wind, and I don't know the shape that I'm in,&quot; forinstance, reminds of bubble-gum lyrics from the '60s.;    Eleven of a dozentunes were written by Buffalo or Rogers, the other a sweet-treat gospel tunewritten by the Rev. Robert Wilkins. &quot;I wish I was in heaven, sittin' down . .. take away these sins and give me grace,&quot; they sing after a delicious, spookyguitar/harp opening.; -- John Orr  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Mercury News Staff  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910809  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Friday  </DAY><MONTH>  August  </MONTH><PG.COL>  23  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  756  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Friday August 9, 199100222013,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
