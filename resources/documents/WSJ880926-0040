Insured property losses from the hurricane, which had weakened considerably by the time it reached the Texas coast, will total about $40 million, according to the American Insurance Services Group, an industry organization that gathers claims data and assists insurers with loss control.    A spokesman for the group said the 40 tornadoes spawned by Gilbert that hit several communities in the southern part of the state did most of the damage. The estimates don't include damage in the Caribbean and Mexico or losses covered by federal flood insurance, those involving ocean marine property, farms and crops, or utility equipment.    Before the storm fizzled, forecasters worried that losses in the U.S. might run as high as $4 billion. </TEXT></DOC>
