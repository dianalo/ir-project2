The public soon will get a chance to viewWashington's urgent warning for the first time.;   This year, Valley ForgeNational Historical Park marks the anniversary of the soldiers' ordeal bydisplaying the letter, which was bequeathed to the park by a collector.;  Acting curator Phyllis Ewing said the letter -- a fragile, yellowed documentwith ink faded to a dull brown -- is the prize of the park's collection. Threeof its 10 pages will be displayed from Friday through Jan. 5.;   Washington'sletter isn't easy to read, filled with run-on sentences and spellings,punctuation and words considered odd today.

Tomorrow may betoo late.' &quot;  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Associated Press  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Valley Forge, Pa.  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   911217  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Tuesday  </DAY><MONTH>  December  </MONTH><PG.COL>  4A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  274  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Tuesday, December 17, 199100352140,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
