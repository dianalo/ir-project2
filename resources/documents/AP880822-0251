The impact of the so-called ``greenhouse effect'' was one ofmany problems highlighted on the opening day of the 26th Congressof the International Geographic Union.   The week-long meeting of 1,200 scientists from 55 countries isthe largest ever held in the southern hemisphere. The last congresswas held in Paris four years ago. Organizers said that more than700 scientific papers would be presented this week.   Scientists said the build-up of man-made gases will cause sealevels to rise by about one meter (3.3 feet) within a century,swamping many low-lying coral atolls such as Kiribati _ formerlythe Gilbert Islands _ and Tuvalu. The two nations have a combinedpopulation of about 68,000.   Also at risk are the Maldives in the Indian Ocean as well as theMarshall Islands and Tokelau in the Pacific Ocean, said a paperpresented by Peter Roy and John Connell, of Australia's Departmentof Mineral Resources and Sydney University's Department ofGeography, respectively.   ``The experience will be catastrophic for some people,'' saidRoy.   Not only would there be very little higher ground for thepopulation to retreat to but fresh water on the islands was likelyto dry up, destroying the ecology, he said.   The scientists suggested immediate attention be given toengineering works to keep the sea at bay.   ``Increased migration, to high islands and overseas, is thesingle most probable outcome of rising sea levels,'' the congresswas told. ``Some of the most recently populated islands are likelyto be depopulated, and even abandoned, as a new class of`environmental refugee' is superimposed on that of `economicrefugee.'''   Brian walker, chief ecologist of the Australian government'smain science body _ the commonwealth, science and industrialresearch organization _cautioned there would be some beneficialeffects to the widely held prediction of catastrophe.   ``For example, ice-free sea lanes have an impact,'' Walker said,in an interview. ``The fact is there will be a great deal of changebut I'm not saying it will be predominantly bad.''   However, Canadian geographer Dr. Roger Tomlinson of Ottowa saida major task was to compile a data bank of existing knowledge aboutchanges that are likely to occur.   ``It is a gargantuan task,'' he told the Associated Press. ``Wewould need a computer 40,000 times more powerful than anything thatexists now. To understand the impact on humans is not going to beeasy. Just to put the information down on paper would stand some 60miles (96 kilometers) high.''   Meanwhile, Prof. Nicholas Polunin, of the World Council forBiosphere in Geneva, Switzerland, said the world is reeling underat least 20 identified menaces _ the worst of which is too manypeople.   He said the threats range from overpopulation and nuclearholocaust to destruction of the ozone shield and human epidemicssuch as aids.   ``Yet basic to the vast majority is the problem of humanoverpopulation, which in various ways is strangling the world,'' hesaid.   Polunin said the threat of nuclear warfare, a nuclear ``winter''and nuclear accidents was the number one horror which could bringlife to a standstill with littls hope of ever recovering, whiledestruction of the stratospheric ozone shield, which filters offmost of the harmful ultraviolet radiation from the sun, already wasresulting in increased skin-cancers.   Other menaces, according to Polunin, include the greenhouseeffect _ global warming due to the increasing buildup of carbondioxide, methane and other trace gases _ as well as deforestation,devegetation and desertification, depletion of raw materials,insufficient agricultural land, sea-level rising through floods,widespread excessive pollutions, and climatic variations.</TEXT></DOC>
