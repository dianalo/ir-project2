Kennedy, willbe using IBIS by the middle of next year.andM;&quot;When IBIS is fully implemented, we will have covered 67 percent of thecurrent air traffic coming into the country,&quot; Mulvenna said.andM;Each airport will have Acer 5280 microcomputers from Acer Technologies Corp.andO;of San Jose, Calif.andP;  The 12-MHz 286 systems have 640K RAM, one 3-1/2-inch,720K floppy-disk drive and an amber monochrome monitor.andM;The secondary processing points, where visitors are checked more thoroughly,will have Wyse 2112 microcomputers from Wyse Technology of San Jose, Calif.andO;The 2112 is a 12-MHz 286 system that has a 3-1/2-inch, 1.4M floppy-diskdrive, 1M RAM, a 20M hard-disk drive and an amber monochrome monitor.andM;Each primary and secondary workstation will have an ImageReader PV-2 documentreader made by AIT Corp. of Chantilly, Va., for scanning passports, visas andalien cards.andM;The airports' micros will be linked by a token-ring LAN using AdvancedNetWare Version 2.15 from Novell Inc. and network adapters from IBM Corp. and3Com Corp.andM;Acer 1100/20 20-MHz 386 systems will be the network file servers.andP;  Thesystems each have 4M RAM, one 1.2M floppy drive, a 150M hard-disk drive and amonochrome monitor.andM;Wyse 2112 network stations with synchronous controllers act as mainframegateways for the networks.andM;RabbitGate II BSC/SNA from Rabbit Software Corp. in Malvern, Pa., is thegateway software.andM;Each airport LAN will have a Wyse 2112 microcomputer dedicated for remote LANadministration.andP;  The systems will be equipped as are the Wyse end-userworkstations but also will have a 5-1/4-inch floppy-disk drive and anexternal 19.2-kilobit/sec modem from Telebit Corp. of Mountain View, Calif.andM;Each remote LAN administrator system also will have stand-alone versions ofLotus 1-2-3, dBase, WordPerfect and Co/Session remote accesstelecommunications software from Triton Technologies Inc. in Iselin, N.J.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
