The assessment by Khalid Hassan, a senior adviser to PLO chairmanYasser Arafat, came as another leading figure in the PLO said itsrenunciation of terror does not mean it will cease attacks onIsraeli military targets.

By at least one measure _ United Way's projection for the year of6 percent to 7 percent growth _ donations nationwide appear to haveincreased.   Charities in many communities say contributions of money,clothing, toys and food are at least keeping pace with last year andshould pick up this week before Christmas.   But in other cities, contributions have dropped, hampered by coldweather, a shortage of bell ringers, shopping malls that banishfund-raisers from entrances, weak local economies, or even a drainon givers from campaign contributions earlier this year.   Efforts to aid the victims of the earthquake in Soviet Armeniaappear to be having an impact on domestic giving in some cities, butnot in others, say spokesmen for the Salvation Army, American RedCross, Volunteers of America, United Way, food banks and othercharities.   Among the nation's biggest cities, collections were reported upin New York, Chicago, and Atlanta, but down in Los Angeles. In theMidwest, Indianapolis, Kansas City, Mo., and St. Louis reportedhealthy donations, while Minneapolis, Detroit and Iowa's cities werehaving a more difficult time. And in the West, Phoenix and Tucson,Ariz., showed drops, while Denver and Salt Lake City charities saidtheir contributions were on target.</TEXT><HEAD>Embargoed for Release Until 12 noon EST</HEAD><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A review panel today recommended highersalaries and greater independence for top scientists at the NationalInstitutes of Health, the government's chief research arm in thefight against AIDS, cancer and other major diseases.   The committee of the National Academy of Sciences alsorecommended against turning NIH into an independent agency orfarming its projects out to private companies.
