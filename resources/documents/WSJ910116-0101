The phone calls home have been curtailedto prevent any slips of the tongue. The pilots are hunchedover blue folders prominently labeled &quot;secret.&quot; And Lt. Col.Donald Kline is taking long walks to work off his nervousenergy.   Lt. Col. Kline is the reputed dean of air-to-air combatand the most experienced active-duty F-15 pilot in the AirForce, with 2,700 hours under his belt. And if the U.S.attacks, the 27th Fighter Squadron, which he commands, willprobably provide the protection for the first wave of U.S.bombers ordered to the north.</LP><TEXT>   In a war likely to begin in the air and likely to involvethe most concentrated show of air power in history, Lt. Col.Kline's men may well be the first ones to fight. &quot;The guysare finally down to very cold and sober thoughts,&quot; says the42-year-old Texan.   No one knows when the stillness will be broken. The menroutinely inspect their gray and green flight suits, equippedwith high-tech life-support devices, hung along a wall in thesquad room. They lift weights. They jog. They play cards andwrite letters home.   And during the evenings, when they gather in small groups,the commander walks from one to the next, playing a rolesomewhere between coach and psychotherapist.   &quot;I usually tell them they need to get angry,&quot; he says.Fighter pilots have to be riled, he explains, not to thepoint of recklessness, but revved up enough that they wantliterally to blast their way through any impediment to thesuccessful completion of their mission.   When the orders come, the men will assemble in the squadroom quickly, for in recent nights they have made a point ofsleeping in the nearby bunkers. They will receive a highlytechnical briefing involving which bombers they will beescorting, which altitudes they will be flying, whichfrequencies they will use for communications, which refuelingtankers they will use and, of course, which targets themission will be asked to destroy.   Once aloft in their shark-gray F-15 Eagles, they will beable to fly as high as 12 miles and at as much as 2.5 timesthe speed of sound, firing radar-guided Sparrow or Sidewindermissiles and rattling off rounds from a six-barrel Gatlinggun -- all the while perhaps drawing the first Iraqi missilefire from the ground.   No one will have ever flown such a mission. In World WarI, it was the 27th Squadron, the oldest fighter squadron inthe U.S. military, whose Sopwith Camels menaced Germanaviators. Its pilots were decorated for their role in thebloody air campaigns over Italy and over the oil fields ofRomania in the last years of World War II. In those battles,and in Vietnam as well, the fighters engaged in dogfights,dueling at a range close enough that they could sometimes aimat the tailpipes of enemy aircraft.   This time the dogfights will be highly impersonal, foughtat ranges of 20 miles or more, with radar scopes,night-fighting capability and all manner of sophisticatedelectronics helping to determine the winners. And uponcompletion of one of these high-precision, instant-reactionmissions, the pilots will have to begin preparing for anotherone almost immediately, perhaps within hours.   The U.S. will launch more than 2,000 sorties a day, usingeverything from F-117 Stealth fighters to the workhorse B-52sthat drop old-fashioned one-ton gravity bombs. The key to theinitial U.S. air assault will be catching as many Iraqiplanes as possible on the ground and quickly zeroing in onanti-aircraft and missile sites. The next stage wouldprobably involve bombing command centers to isolate the Iraqiforce in Kuwait.   &quot;I just don't think Saddam Hussein understands the furythat will be unleashed,&quot; says the lanky Lt. Col. Kline.   Nor, for that matter, the grit and determination of thepilots, he suggests. Outraged by Saddam Hussein's recentthreats that Iraq will &quot;devour&quot; captured U.S. pilots, Mr.Kline wisecracks that he has started bathing in seasoningsalt: &quot;If he wants to eat me, he's going to get indigestion.&quot;   Lt. Col. Kline is nearly a generation older than some ofhis men and has nearly 10 times the flying experience ofmany. Capt. Steve Olds, 26 years old, has never experiencedthe rush of evading live missiles. For him, preparationinvolves getting ready to put himself on automatic pilot.   &quot;You have to divorce yourself from everything back home,and all the pleasant things of life,&quot; he says. &quot;There isn'tany room for second thoughts.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
