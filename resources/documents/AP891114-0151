The compromise bill, which came up just a day before Polishlabor leader Lech Walesa was to address a joint meeting ofCongress, also contained the first hard cash to back up a promisedthree-year U.S. aid program for Poland and Hungary. The vote on theoverall measure was 324 to 93.   One contentious issue in the $14.6 billion bill was defused whenthe House voted to give President Bush the right to withhold $15million for the United Nations Population Fund if he finds theagency supports forced abortions or sterilizations in China.   But a veto threat against the bill remained over a prohibitionon the use of foreign aid money to persuade other countries tocarry out policies prohibited by U.S. law.   For El Salvador, whose government is battling a fierce onslaughtby leftist rebels of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front,the bill would provide up to $85 million in military aid $12million for police training and equipment.   Because lawmakers larded the bill with dozens of provisionsrequiring that certain amounts go to various other countries andprograms, it is unlikely there will be enough military aid moneyleft to give the rightist government of Alfredo Cristiani its fullaid complement.   For Eastern Europe, the bill included $293 million to fund thefirst year of the three-year program to encourage political andeconomic reform in Poland and Hungary, along with $240 million instand-by credit and trade insurance _ a total of $533 million.   Major elements of the appropriations measure included a $200million grant to help stabilize Poland's battered economy and $45million for a private enterprise development fund. Other moneywould go for environmental cleanup, agriculture and educational andcultural exchanges.   Bush had threatened a veto on issues growing out of two highlypolitical controversies: abortion and the Reagan administration'sconduct during the Iran-Contra affair.   The bill had provided $15 million to support the U.N. PopulationFund, reversing a five-year ban on U.S. aid to that agency. The aidwas included in the Senate by Sen. Barbara Mikulski, D-Md., whoargued that it was time to resume help for the U.N.'s familyplanning efforts.   ``What we're talking about here is the lives of women,'' saidRep. Jan Meyers, R-Kan., noting that the average number of birthsper woman in Sub-Saharan Africa is 6.5, and that pregnancy causesone in four deaths there among women aged 15 to 49.   But opponents noted that the agency operates programs in China,which has a one-child-per-family policy that allegedly has led toforced abortions and sterilizations. Anti-abortion forces sought tokill the provision, despite a stipulation in the bill that the U.S.money not be used in China.   Rep. Christopher Smith, R-N.J., couched the issue as one ofcoercive against voluntary family planning, andnoted that any moneyto the U.N. agency would free funds to be used in China.   In a pair of apparently contradictory votes, opponents firstfailed on a vote of 244-178 to delete the money from the bill, thenprevailed 219 to 203 when they sought to place conditions on thefamily planning aid.   The motion which passed would let Bush withhold the funding ifhe determines that the U.N. agency supports any program of coercedabortion or sterilization, and Smith said that would remove a Bushveto threat on the issue.   The remaining provision tempting a veto was a ban on the use offoreign aid money to ``leverage'' other countries that receive itinto carrying out U.S. policies that are contrary to the law.Documents released at the trial of Iran-Contra figure Oliver Northshowed the United States had expedited aid to Honduras as a rewardfor its harboring of the Contra rebels fighting Nicaragua's leftistgovernment.   Overall, the measure included $4.7 billion in military aid and$3.2 billion in economic aid.   Among major earmarks for countries in the bill were $3 billionfor Israel and $2.1 billion for Egypt, always the largest aidrecipients because of their participation in the Camp David MiddleEast peace process.   Other large recipients included Pakistan, with $460 million inmilitary and economic aid; Turkey, $500 million in military aid;Greece, $350 million in military aid; $63 million in military andeconomic aid for Morocco; and $125 million in military aid to helpthe countries of Colombia, Peru and Bolivia fight the war on drugs.   In addition, the agreement provides $160 million for the U.S.contribution to the Multilateral Assistance Initiative for thePhilippines, $83 million for Afghanistan relief, $83 million forJordan and $30 million in military aid to countries in Sub-SaharanAfrica.</TEXT></DOC>
