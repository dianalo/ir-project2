This section governsreasonable access by commercial vehicles with lengths and widths authorizedby the Surface Transportation Assistance Act of 1982 (STAA), as amended.Through this NPRM, the FHWA requested comments by May 1, 1989, regardinga proposed definition of ``terminals.'' It also proposed to establish nationalminimum access requirements for operation of STAA-defined vehicles on theNational Network in all States in a safe and efficient manner. Notice No.3 was published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on May 4, 1989, (54 FR 19196) extending the commentperiod to September 1, 1989, at the request of those wanting to have thebenefit of the results of the Transportation Research Board (TRB) studyon ``reasonable access'' before commenting. On July 6, 1989, the TRB releaseda report addressing many of the issues involving reasonable access. Thissupplemental NPRM has been prepared to solicit comments on a third optionbased on recommendations in that report. The comment period is hereby reopenedand extended to December 1, 1989.

Through this NPRM, the FHWA requested comments from allaffected and interested parties regarding proposed changes that would define``terminals'' and establish national minimum access requirements for STAA-definedcommercial vehicles entering or leaving the National Network. The commentperiod, which was originally scheduled to close on May 1, 1989, was extendedto September 1, 1989, by a notice published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on May 4, 1989 (54 FR 19196). The extension wasintended to provide time for interested and affected parties to have thebenefit of the results of the July 1989 TRB study on ``reasonable access''before commenting.Based on a review of the report, FHWA is now proposing a third option reflectingthe TRB recommendations. This supplemental NPRM discusses the third option,and provides specific regulatory language for implementation, and reopensthe comment period. The NPRM published on December 30, 1988, was structured around a presumptivestandard of reasonable access of 5 miles coupled with a certification process.The TRB report specifically rejects a mileage-based standard, deeming it``inappropriate'' because it is unable to ``take into account differencesin local highway and traffic conditions.'' The TRB report recommends anapproach which ``would require the States to evaluate the adequacy of highwaysto accommodate STAA vehicles in relation to the performance and handlingcharacteristics of these large vehicles.'' The December 30, 1988, NPRM proposed two options. This supplementary noticeadds a third option built on the TRB report. The TRB approach would requirea process to evaluate proposed route requests, and access could only bedenied through an affirmative demonstration of an existing or potentialsafety problem on the route. The FHWA invites comments on whether this alternative is consistent withthe statute, which requires States only to provide ``reasonable access.''Option 3_CertificationOption 3 would be a certification-based approach. All States regulatingaccess would be required to have their procedures certified by the FHWA.A State's procedures would be required to consider the characteristicsof the class of STAA vehicles and the characteristics of the road on whichaccess is being considered. Safety would be the sold basis for all determinations.Several general approaches would comply with the TRB recommendations. Oneapproach would be a test drive of a vehicle of the type in question onthe route being evaluated. A number of States are using this approach verysuccessfully. Second, templates could be used if adequate route inventoriesare available. In this case, a template is a device that measures off-trackingon road plans. The use of templates would assess off-tracking and possiblelane encroachment. Third, a State's laws or regulations could grant accessto any semitrailer with a kingpin setting of 41 feet or less.The FHWA would review each State's reasonable access policy to determineif certification is warranted.<ITAG tagnum="84">Kingpin Setting</ITAG>The TRB report discusses the third general approach, using configurationsof 41 feet from kingpin to rear axle or axles on STAA tractor-semitrailersas a basis for a State's reasonable access policy. ``* * * A small majorityof the committee further recommend that all States be encouraged to adopta maximum kingpin setting of 41 feet (measured from the kingpin to thecenter of the rear trailer axle or group of axles) on their National Networkhighways and access routes * * *'' The report added that, ``* * * Severalother committee members proposed stronger action, recommending that allStates be required to adopt a maximum kingpin setting of 41 feet and thatthe FHWA be directed to include this setting in the final rulemaking onaccess. This kingpin setting should also be included in FHWA regulationsthat apply to National Network highways as well as access routes * * *''The critical dimension for off-tracking, according to TRB's report, isthe distance from the kingpin to the center of the rear axle or axles.The TRB report found that STAA tractor-semitrailers with a longer wheelbasepresent operational problems on certain interchange ramps and at intersections,particularly in urban areas. These problems reduce access for these vehiclesto services and terminals.In this supplemental NPRM, the FHWA is not proposing a maximum kingpinsetting that would apply to the National Network itself. Such a changewould go beyond the subject matter of the rule. However, the adoption ofa kingpin-to-axle requirement for access would obviously have an effecton vehicles on the network. As the 1982 STAA clearly specified how lengthshould affect the use of the network by STAA vehicles, the kingpin-to-axlesettings cannot restrict use of the National Network by STAA vehicles.Option 3, however, would establish a certification criterion for roadsproviding reasonable access off the National Network. Under this option,a State could not impose maximum limits on kingpin settings of less than41 feet. Higher maximum limits would remain a subject for State discretion.The FHWA invites comments on using kingpin setting as a basis for determiningthe suitability of tractor-semitrailers for access. Comment and informationare requested on the proposed minimum distance for State maximum kingpinsetting limits and the method of measurement; the effects on safety ofthe overhang on the longer STAA semitrailers; and the practicality of lawenforcement and compliance. The FHWA also requests information on the impactsthis proposal may have on the productivity of shippers, carriers, and truckmanufacturers; and the impact on existing and future STAA vehicles thatdo not conform to the proposed minimum 41 feet for State maximum kingpinsettings and do not have rear axles that are adjustable.Option 3_WidthThe 1982 STAA increased the authorized vehicle width from 96 inches to102 inches. The TRB report found that the increase ``has only a minor effecton the safe operation of STAA vehicles, except on narrow lanes of 10 feetor less.'' In keeping with the TRB report, this option provides that noState may deny access to an STAA-defined vehicle based solely on the factthat a vehicle is 102 inches wide. To deny access on a particular route,a State would have to demonstrate that the added width degrades safetysignificantly on that route.Option 3_TerminalsIn defining ``terminals,'' the NPRM of December 30, 1988, proposed threecriteria. At least one of these criteria would have to be satisfied beforea facility is considered a terminal for the purposes of reasonable access.Under one of the three criteria, a facility could be considered a terminalif STAA vehicles are completely loaded or completely unloaded. The FHWAalso asked specific questions in the NPRM on possible alternative definitions,such as a more traditional definition of ``terminal.'' The TRB report'sdefinition does not use the completely loaded/unloaded criterion to define``terminal.'' It uses a much broader definition: ``A terminal is any locationwhere: (a) Freight either originates, terminates, or is handled in thetransportation process or (b) carriers maintain operating facilities.''The report goes on to state that ``This definition is not intended to supersedeexisting bans or preclude new bans on combination truck travel, such asthose on through travel on residential streets, weight-posted roads orbridges, or roads not deemed appropriate for access on the basis of safetyand engineering considerations.''The FHWA would like comments on the TRB definition of ``terminal.'' Thedefinition appears to include almost any type of facility or destinationwith few limitations. Commenters should address how this definition comportswith the statute.<ITAG tagnum="84">Federalism Impact on States</ITAG>The FHWA has considered the ``federalism'' implications of this actionin accordance with the principles and policymaking criteria of E.O. 12612,<T3>Federalism</T3>, of October 26, 1987. The NPRM of December 30, 1988,discussed the federalism implications in great detail. The alternativeprovisions included in this supplemental NPRM, based on the July 1989 TRBreport, would impose more adverse impacts on the States and would intrudeinto State authority more than would provisions in the December 1988 NPRM.Fifteen States allow unlimited access and thus will not be affected bythis rulemaking in any of its options. Approximately 19 of the 35 Statesthat regulate access have some form of route review for designating access.These reviews would be subject to the proposed criteria of Option 3. Theremaining 16 States would be required to establish a review process orremove limits on access for STAA vehicles.Under one of the options in the December 1988 proposal, any State providingaccess of 5 miles or greater as a standard for reasonable access wouldmeet the reasonable access requirements, provided the State has some typeof process to evaluate requests for access greater than 5 miles. Nine Statesof the remaining 16 States had such a provision and would have qualified.Thus, the number of States affected significantly by the earlier NPRM couldhave been as low as seven. As discussed in the preamble to the December1988 NPRM, these numbers are approximate because categorizing the differentStates' access provisions is difficult. The TRB report contains a substantial,updated discussion of State access provisions.<ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Impact</ITAG>The FHWA has determined that this rulemaking is not a major rulemakingaction within the meaning of Executive Order 12291. However, this rulemakinghas been included in DOT's Regulatory Program for significant rulemakings.These determinations by the FHWA are based on the nature of the rulemaking.The FHWA proposes to amend the existing final rule, issued June 5, 1984,and amended April 13, 1988, by establishing minimum criteria and proceduresfor the implementation of the reasonable access provisions required bythe STAA. The impacts of the three options addressed in the proposed rulemakingsdo not significantly alter the impacts initially projected in the June1984 final rule. A Regulatory Impact Analysis was prepared for the June1984 rulemaking and is available for inspection in FHWA's HeadquartersOffice 400 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC 20590. Copies may be obtainedby contacting Mr. Kevin E. Heanue or Mr. John F. Grimm at the address providedunder the heading <T2>``FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT.''</T2> For the same reason, andunder the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, the FHWA certifiesthat this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantialnumber of small entities.In consideration of the foregoing, the FHWA proposes to amend chapter 1of title 23, Code of Federal Regulations, by revising part 658 as set forthbelow.<ITAG tagnum="20">(Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance Program Number 220.205, HighwayPlanning and Construction.
