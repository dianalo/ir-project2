Beyond provedreserves, all volumes of future natural gas supply are estimates basedon information derived from past and current experience in gas productionand reservoir development. Even proved reserves are subject to periodicrevision. This assessment was conducted starting with an understandingof major components of the natural gas supply derived from existing resourceestimates that use established methodologies. In addition to historicallydefined elements of the resource base, a new component{emdash}reservegrowth in heterogeneous reservoirs{emdash}is quantified in this study.Resource assessments proceed in their planning and compilation from reasonablywell-known quantities (proved reserves) to increasingly less well-knownquantities (undiscovered resources). Further, natural gas reservoirstermed unconventional are typically given separate consideration andinclude gas in low-permeability reservoirs, gas in shale formations,such as Devonian of the Eastern US, and coalbed methane resources. Thisapproach has been followed in this assessment. Special note was madeof Alaskan gas reserves in that they are significant and proven, buttransportation for North Slope gas to the Lower 48 states is lacking.A summary of the results of this assessment shows that a technicallyrecoverable reserve and resource base of 1,059 trillion cubic feeet (Tcf)of natural gas exists in the Lower 48 states. This resource base is madeup of proved reserves, inferred reserves, and sources. The latter requiresdiscovery and development, some using improved understanding of reservoirframeworks that must be more fully developed and applied. 72 refs., 18tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
