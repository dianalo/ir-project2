This study is intended to help plannersbecome more aware of energy issues in their work, and to increase theircapability to deal with energy problems and initiate needed action. Publishedliterature was reviewed, prominent examples of municipal energy planningin Canada and the USA were examined, a questionnaire survey of Canadianplanners was conducted, and practitioners and researchers were consultedto provide the basis for identifying planning-related energy conservationmeasures. These were in turn assessed as to their applicability for theCanadian scene, and some of the difficult strategic questions that arisewhen planners attempt to adapt such measures to specific communitieswere considered. Examples of planning-related conservation measures includethermally efficient site planning, protection of local energy resources,increasing public awareness and participation, optimizing land use forminimal transportation requirements, and promotion of conservation throughbylaws, regulations, and other controls.
