<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-81-0625 </DOCNO><TEXT>A study of Rayleigh-Benard convection was conducted in liquid {sup 4}Heand a {sup 3}He-{sup 4}He mixture (c = 0.038) confined in a cylindricalcontainer with variable height. In {sup 4}He, measured critical Rayleighnumbers R/sub c/ are in agreement with the predictions. The data forthe initial slope of the Nusselt curve show that the convection patternin the fluid layer can be described by predictions for parallel rolls.Also studied was the onset of time dependence, which is most likely causedby the skew varicose instability. Two types of time dependence were foundat onset, one with vanishing amplitude and the other with vanishing frequencyof the oscillation. In the {sup 3}He-{sup 4}He mixture, when the separationratio S is below the polycritical point, no time-dependent oscillationswere found at the onset of convection as predicted by theory. But Nusseltcurves show several discontinuous transitions at and above the onsetof convection. Time dependence does occur for R andgt; R/sub c/. For S andgt; O,the results for the Nusselt curves can be described reasonably well bythe five-mode model.</TEXT></DOC>
