With two small children, she would rather not work somuch, she says. But she doesn't see a better choice: Thismonth's 11.8% increase in the federal minimum hourly wage, to$4.25 from $3.80, will cost the motel about $5,000 this yearunless it cuts back on workers' hours, Ms. Gibbs says.</LP><TEXT>   Guest House could attempt to raise room rates, but itfears losing business. Meanwhile, if the owners had an extra$5,000 to spend, they would rather buy new carpets than spendmore on labor. &quot;It's a pretty major headache, when everypenny counts,&quot; Ms. Gibbs says of the minimum-wage increase.   As minimum-wage increases go, this one is producingmaximum pain at many small companies, or so many ownersclaim. The main reason is timing: Many businesses are beingforced to raise their pay levels in the midst of a recessionthat makes recovery of the increased costs problematic. &quot;Theincrease hits at a very bad time,&quot; says William C.Dunkelberg, business dean at Temple University inPhiladelphia and chief economist for the National Federationof Independent Business, the country's largest small-businesstrade group.   Labor leaders say low-paid workers desperately need thepay raise anyway. And not all small businesses are beinghurt. Millions of workers are still exempt from minimum-wageprovisions for reasons other than an employer's size. Somecompanies will succeed in passing along higher labor costs totheir customers. Moreover, the minimum wage is irrelevant,especially in labor-short regions, to many companies thathave long paid substantially more.   But the latest wage mandate comes with a twist especiallyalarming to some of the smallest businesses: At least fornow, fewer businesses than before are exempt from theminimum-wage law.   That's a shock to many owners as Congress raised -- to$500,000 from $362,000 -- the maximum sales of employersexempt on the basis of size. But the National Federation ofIndependent Business says the new law, unlike the old, alsodisallows exemptions for any employees engaged in interstatecommerce -- very broadly defined.   &quot;Many businesses that may never have been covered byminimum-wage provisions before are covered now,&quot; says TracyWurzel, a legislative representative for the small-businesstrade group, based in Washington. New legislation, aimed atrestoring the lost exemptions, is before Congress as aproposed technical correction to the wage law. But for now,more small employers than ever before must cope with theminimum-wage provisions, authorities say.   Thomas Urist and his wife, Ann, have operated their Big TDrive In restaurant for 17 years in Thermopolis, a Wyomingtown of 3,700. Until April 1, they were exempt on the basisof size from minimum-wage regulations. But this year, becauseof the broad interpretation of the interstate-commerce rules,they aren't exempt.   Mr. Urist, who has four full-time employees and about 16to 18 part-timers, mostly from the local high school, saysthe new regulation would raise his salary costs about 15%.&quot;I'd have to make about $50,000 to $60,000 more just to stayeven, and that's almost impossible to do in this economy,&quot;Mr. Urist says. For the moment, Mr. Urist is exploringpossible loopholes. If all else fails, he says, he may try tosell the restaurant.   For many other small companies accustomed to paying less,an 11.8% forced increase in wages can be a rude awakening.Mr. Dunkelberg, the small-business economist, says the medianamount of start-up capital for small businesses is only$20,000. Thus, a minimum-wage increase for only two full-timeworkers might eat up as much as 10% of capital. &quot;These arenontrivial hits,&quot; Mr. Dunkelberg says.   The minimum-wage increase directly affected only aboutfour million of the nation's nearly 62 million hourlyworkers, according to the Labor Department. But many smallcompanies say the increase shook up their entire paystructures.   Al Vias, manager of Twins Inc., says the Miami swimwearmaker raised pay for only five of its 70 employees as adirect result of the law. But for reasons of motivation andmorale, he says, the company will have to maintain the gapbetween its minimum-wage workers and those who earn more.Thus, &quot;we'll have to raise salaries for everyone else aswell,&quot; he says. The increase in direct wage costs promptsrises in payroll-based taxes as well. &quot;It's a never-endingstaircase,&quot; Mr. Vias says.   Some small businesses are confident of recovering theincreased costs by raising prices. In the case of child care,for example, &quot;most increases in expenses can be passed on toparents,&quot; says Richard Glaser, a member of the board ofAmerican Family Service Corp., a child-care center operatorin King of Prussia, Pa. The company pays above the minimumwage, but Mr. Glaser says it raised pay recently to maintainits advantage over minimum-wage employers.   For many other businesses, however, there is little or nohope of recovering the added labor costs through priceincreases. Donald Ratajczak, a professor of economics atGeorgia State University, Atlanta, says, &quot;To the extent thatsmall companies in the South compete for business because oftheir low labor costs, they are going to lose business tomanufacturers in Mexico and Haiti.&quot;   Even in regions where pay is generally higher, somebusinesses see problems because of the latest minimum-wageincrease. &quot;We can't keep raising prices forever,&quot; says BarryPotekin, co-owner of Gold Coast Dogs Inc., a three-storefast-food concern in Chicago. Mr. Potekin, with 63 employees,says he has never hired anyone for the minimum wage. &quot;We'vealways paid people $4 or $4.25 to start,&quot; he says. But withthe minimum wage at $4.25, Gold Coast -- to maintain thequality of its applicants -- will have to start payingemployees at least $5 to start, he says.   That will increase Gold Coast's expenses $200 to $250 aweek. Mr. Potekin says sales would have to rise by $1,000 aweek to offset the costs. But sales have dropped recently.Mr. Potekin sees reduced profits ahead -- and says he mighthave to get along with fewer workers.   Universal Landscapes Inc., a landscaping company inHouston, says it will attempt to raise prices -- quoting jobsat $20 per man-hour, 33% more than a year ago. &quot;We're notmaking it -- there's not enough money coming in,&quot; says VicePresident Thomas C. Morrison. He fears the company will losebusiness if it charges higher prices but says it has nochoice, largely because of the minimum-wage increase.   &quot;The minimum wage is just one more thing where thegovernment says, `Here it is, this is good for society,'&quot; Mr.Morrison says. &quot;But it's bad for the company.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
