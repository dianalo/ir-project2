Mrs. Aquino bitterly criticized Vice President Salvador Laurel,Sen. Juan Ponce Enrile and others who have called for herresignation after mutinous soldiers launched the sixth andstrongest attempt yet to oust her.   ``He (Laurel) cannot wait to be president,'' she told a rally atthe site where hundreds of thousands of Filipinos filled thestreets to support her 1986 ``people power'' revolution. ``I willnever give up this position to him.''   She made no reference to any of the complaints of the rebels orof other critics who claim her government has failed to live up tothe promises of social justice and reform.   In the southern city of Cebu, a leader of rebel soldiers holdinga military base today ruled out surrendering to loyalist troops,keeping the insurrection alive.   Mrs. Aquino had called on Filipinos to turn out into the streetstoday for a rally and Roman Catholic Mass, hoping to rekindle thespirit of the huge demonstrations that propelled her into office inFebruary 1986 and ousted President Ferdinand Marcos.   Estimates of the crowd size at today's rally varied widely.Government television said 1 million people joined the rally, butreporters estimated the crowd at more than 100,000.   Government offices encouraged their employees to turn out in ashow of support for the embattled president. Some governmentworkers were bused in from as far as Angeles, 50 miles to the north.   ``I want all of us to unite and to give support to thedemocratic systems of government and to go after these people whowant to destroy our democracy, who want to destroy our economy, whowant to destroy the Filipino people,'' she said in English.   In Tagalog, the main Philippine language, Mrs. Aquino bitterlycriticized Laurel and Enrile, leaders of the opposition NacionistaParty. The crowd cheered wildly and chanted ``Cory! Cory! Cory!''at mention of the two opposition leaders' names.   ``He keeps on urging me to resign,'' Mrs. Aquino said of Laurel.``What does he think I am? Stupid?''   ``...If Laurel really loves our country like he always says,then I suggest he resign so we can use the money from his office,''Mrs. Aquino said.   In his homily, Cardinal Jaime L. Sin, Roman Catholic archbishopof Manila, condemned ``self-appointed messiahs'' for launching thecoup attempt.   He called for the mutinous soldiers to face punishment ``withthe full force of the law.   ``We have condemned the naked and brazen bid for power throughviolence and bloodshed,'' Sin said.   At least 79 people have been killed and more than 570 otherssince Dec. 1, when rebel soldiers took over several militarygarrisons and bombed the presidential palace.   Loyal forces, backed by air cover from U.S. F-4 fighter jets,counterattacked and regained most bases. Early Thursday, mutineersmarched back to their bases from the financial district of Makati,claiming they were voluntarily returning to their barracks.   But negotiations broke down with the final rebel group of 400,which has held Mactan air base at Cebu City, 350 miles south ofManila, since the coup attempt began.   ``To negotiate for surrender is still out of the question,''Brig. Gen. Jose Commendador, leader of the Mactan rebels, toldreporters early today. ``Surrender seems to be the only option thatthey want.''   Laurel predicted Thursday there would be more violent attemptsto topple Mrs. Aquino until she addresses fundamental problems ofpoverty and social injustice that plague Philippine society.   The military claimed about 300 rebels gave up in the Makatifinancial district in Manila, but reporters said the numberappeared to be closer to 500. Officials estimate more than 3,000troops joined the mutiny at its highpoint.   The rebels withdrew from Makati one day after about 1,800foreigners, among them roughly 250 Americans, were evacuated fromrebel-held luxury hotels there.   On Dec. 2, Mrs. Aquino ruled out negotiations with the rebelsand warned them ``surrender or die.'' But in the end she steppedaside to allow loyal military commanders to resolve the crisispeacefully.   Most rebel officers in past coup attempts have simply beenconfined to barracks. The government has not said what punishment,if any, would be leveled against the mutinous soldiers.</TEXT></DOC>
