<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-30-0812 </DOCNO><TEXT>A multi-dimensional numerical model has been developed for the unsteadystate oscillatory combustion of solid propellants subject to acousticpressure disturbances. Including the gas phase unsteady effects, theassumption of uniform pressure across the flame zone, which has beenconventionally used, is relaxed so that a higher frequency response inthe long flame of a double-base propellant can be calculated. The formulationis based on a premixed, laminar flame with a one-step overall chemicalreaction and the Arrhenius law of decomposition with no condensed phasereaction. In a given geometry, the Galerkin finite element solution showsthe strong resonance and damping effect at the lower frequencies, similarto the result of Denison and Baum. Extended studies deal with the higherfrequency region where the pressure varies in the flame thickness. Thenonlinear system behavior is investigated by carrying out the secondorder expansion in wave amplitude when the acoustic pressure oscillationsare finite in amplitude. Offset in the burning rate shows a negativesign in the whole frequency region considered, and it verifies the experimentalresults of Price. Finally, the velocity coupling in the two-dimensionalmodel is discussed.</TEXT></DOC>
