This court, more than its predecessor, led by WarrenBurger, has distinct hot buttons; push them and you may be onyour way to victory. Ignore them at your peril.</LP><TEXT>   Relying heavily on the literal words of the law, forexample, is a good idea. Inferring legislative intent fromcongressional floor debate isn't.   The pitches that score points disclose aspects of thecourt's thinking that don't always fit neatly beneath theheadings &quot;liberal&quot; or &quot;conservative.&quot; Criminal defendants, tobe sure, can usually count on a chilly reception at the highcourt. But corporations can't assume they will get a friendlyaudience.   The hot buttons will be much in evidence today when thejustices hear new arguments in the cigarette liability case,Cipollone vs. Liggett Group Inc. Possibly the most importantbusiness dispute of the term, it presents the question ofwhether the federal law mandating health warnings oncigarette packages and advertisements precludes smokers whobecome ill from suing tobacco companies. More broadly, thecourt could set guidelines for when state injury law may gofurther than federal statutes -- a matter of huge importanceto manufacturers in many industries.   The high court already heard arguments in the case Oct. 8,at the outset of its current term. But in late October, ittook the unusual step of asking for reargument, presumably sothat the newest justice, Clarence Thomas, could participate.This could mean that there was a 4-4 split and that JusticeThomas will cast the tiebreaking vote. Still, lawyers forboth sides will be trying to cement the votes they have andconvert those against them.   (Liggett, Durham, N.C., is a subsidiary of Brooke GroupLtd., Durham, itself a unit of Brook Management Inc., NewYork.)   Here are some of the tactics that generally impress theRehnquist court and could help decide the cigarette case:                                                                                                          Stick to the text. Base your argument on the words of theConstitution, a statute, an Internal Revenue Service rule --whatever's at hand -- but don't get bogged down in murkyevidence of legislative intent. For generations, attorneyshave relied on lawmakers' public statements to illuminate astatute's purpose. Influenced primarily by Justice AntoninScalia, however, the court lately has shown increasingcontempt for the dense verbiage of committee reports and thepurple prose of floor debate. The reason: These ancillarypronouncements often reflect eleventh-hour political deals orlanguage drafted by anonymous, unaccountable staff aides.   Marc Edell, attorney for the plaintiffs in the tobaccocase, has already proved the rule by breaking it. In his Oct.8 oral argument, he emphasized the legislative background ofthe 1965 federal cigarette-warning law and later amendments.Congress, he told the court, implied in hearings and reportsthat it didn't intend to preclude injury suits againstcigarette makers.   The argument bombed. Justices repeatedly interrupted himto demand that he address the words of the law -- namely, aprovision that bars states from imposing any &quot;requirement orprohibition&quot; relating to cigarette promotion.   This time, Mr. Edell has brought in an experienced SupremeCourt litigator, Prof. Laurence Tribe of Harvard, to handlethe reargument. Although a liberal, Mr. Tribe frequently hasargued against reading between the lines of legislation todiscern its meaning.                                                                                                          Respect the authority of the states. Led by Chief JusticeWilliam Rehnquist and Justice Sandra O'Connor, the court isincreasingly concerned about protecting state autonomyagainst federal encroachment. The loser lately has beenbusiness.   Companies typically ask the court to set aside stateregulations on the theory that they are &quot;pre-empted&quot; by lessstringent federal laws. But the Rehnquist court has ruledthat states possess broad regulatory power as long as aconflict with federal law doesn't exist.   The tobacco companies' lead attorney, Bartow Farr, hasargued that Congress made cigarette-warning requirements afederal concern because of the need to protect againstdiverse, contradictory state rules. Moreover, according tothis view, a suit brought under state injury law isequivalent to the sort of state &quot;requirement or prohibition&quot;that Congress specifically banned.   Mr. Tribe is expected to stress that if Congress wanted toban injury lawsuits, it would have used words such as &quot;noinjury lawsuits.&quot; Moving to the big picture, he is likely toargue that in a political system dominated by federal power,the judiciary should preserve some measure of statesovereignty by imposing a strong presumption againstpre-emption. (Messrs. Tribe and Farr declined in interviewsto discuss their planned strategies.)                                                                                                          Simplify. The Burger court was famous for resolvingconflicts with &quot;balancing tests,&quot; complicated formulas to&quot;weigh&quot; lists of factors. Justices Harry Blackmun and JohnStevens -- the current court's liberal minority -- remainmultifactor fans, and Justice O'Connor favors the balancingapproach as well.   But a majority of the Rehnquist court &quot;is more likely toissue an opinion {trying to put} an end to a legalcontroversy&quot; with a &quot;bright-line rule,&quot; says Robert Giuffra,a former Rehnquist clerk who has written articles about howto win before the current court. The urge to simplifytypically leads to conservative results -- but not always.Mr. Giuffra points to a 1990 decision that could be seen asliberal: The court by a 6-2 vote ruled that once a criminaldefendant has asked for a lawyer, the police may not restartan interrupted interrogation unless the lawyer is present.   The tangled subject of pre-emption doesn't lend itselfeasily to bright lines. But that won't stop smart lawyersfrom offering simple solutions, if asked.   Mr. Farr has hinted at one example: Only the Federal TradeCommission -- and not individuals -- may sue over misleadingcigarette ads. Prof. Tribe could well counter that Congressbears a bright-line obligation to be explicit if it wants todeny consumers their day in court.                                                                                                          Don't shout, and know your audience. In oral arguments,the current court isn't looking for latter-day DanielWebsters or Clarence Darrows. Justice David Souter, for one,is said to dislike flowery oration, especially when it seemsdirected as much at a lawyer's clients and supporters as itis aimed at the bench. Sob stories about hooked, hackingsmokers won't win the cigarette case.                                                                                                          A final tip. Don't address the court as &quot;gentlemen.&quot;Justice O'Connor may interrupt, as she did recently, to askif she's included, too.</TEXT></DOC>
