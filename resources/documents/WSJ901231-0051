And that somebody seems to include mutualfund investors.   In November, stock mutual funds pulled in $1.4 billionmore than they surrendered to departing shareholders.Moreover, a sampling of major fund groups shows thatinvestors continued to pour money into stock funds inDecember.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;I call them the `chicken' stock buyers,&quot; says JonFossel,, president of New York's Oppenheimer Management Corp.He notes that investors may be buying stocks, but they areopting for conservative funds such as equity-income funds andso-called asset allocation funds.   The Aug. 2 Iraqi invasion of Kuwait prompted a rash ofwithdrawals from stock funds. According to the InvestmentCompany Institute, stock funds suffered net outflows of $2.8billion in August and an additional $484 million inSeptember.   That outflow turned around in October, when $734 millionflowed back into stock funds. November's $1.4 billion inflowis the strongest since June 1990. (These figures reflectstock fund sales less redemptions, plus the net result ofswitches between stock funds and other funds in the same fundfamily. Reinvested dividends are excluded.)   Fund groups such as Financial Programs, Janus Capital,Twentieth Century and Vanguard Group all report strong netinflows into their stock funds during December.   But not everybody saw a pickup in the stock fund business.New England Securities and Scudder, Stevens andamp; Clark say thatthe inflows into their stock funds slowed in the past fourweeks. Fidelity Investments says its stock funds saw a smallnet outflow.   &quot;December, of course, is the month that people hold backequity fund purchases because of the capital gainsdistributions,&quot; notes Gavin Quill, a Scudder marketingresearch analyst. At year end, stock funds usually make bigcapital gains and income distributions, on which investorsthen have to pay taxes.   Among specialty funds, Financial Programs and Vanguardboth say that their health care funds were big money magnets,and that their energy funds had net outflows. At FranklinResources, there was keen interest in the fund group's goldand utility funds. &quot;That would seem to indicate that peopleare pretty apprehensive,&quot; says Gregory Johnson, a Franklinmarketing vice president.   The outlook for stock fund sales is bright, according to asurvey conducted for Fidelity by the University of MichiganSurvey Research Center. The December survey found that 35% offund owners plan to buy a stock fund over the next threemonths, up from 25% in November and just 12% in July. (Thesefigures reflect the percentage planning to buy a stock fundminus those planning to sell.)   Stock fund managers, meanwhile, continue to sit on a pileof cash. But because a rising stock market boosted the valueof stock fund assets in November, cash as a percentage offund assets dropped to 12.4% from October's 12.9%.   Though stock fund sales had a rough ride in 1990, thebiggest loser has been taxable bond funds. So far this year,stock funds have pulled in $12.8 billion, but taxable bondfunds have bled $658 million.   High-yielding junk bond funds gave up an additional $399million in November, bringing this year's net outflow to $4.5billion. And U.S. government bond funds have hemorrhaged $7.1billion this year.   Bond funds &quot;were sold primarily to savers, not toinvestors,&quot; says A. Michael Lipper, president of LipperAnalytical Services. For many bond fund investors, he says,&quot;volatility in both dividends and share price has come as asurprise.&quot;   But Oppenheimer's Mr. Fossel says that sales of his fundgroup's government bond funds picked up in December, andother fund companies have noticed a similar trend. &quot;Thepublic has noticed that money fund rates have come down, sothey've extended maturities,&quot; Mr. Fossel says. &quot;I think it'sa very wise move on their part.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
