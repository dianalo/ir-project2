The statement, read over the state-run Riyadh radio, said thatanother four Kuwaitis received prison terms of 15 and 20 years and1,000 to 1,500 lashes of the whip. It said another nine Kuwaitiswere acquitted.   It was the first public word from Saudi Arabia that anyone hadeven been arrested in connection with the July 10 explosions, whichkilled one Pakistani pilgrim and injured 16 pilgrims of variousnationalities.   The bombs went off as roughly 2 million Moslems were preparing tohead to Mount Arafat for the culmination of the pilgrimage rites.Saudi Arabia is home of Islam's holiest shrines at Mecca and Medina.   Saudi Arabians, including the ruling family, are members of themajority Sunni Moslem sect. The Sunnis and the minority Shiite sect,which prevails in Iran, are traditional rivals for the alliegance ofthe world's nearly 1 billon Moslems. The antagonism dates back to asplit that occurred in the 7th century.   Today's announcement said without elaborating that the executionswere carried out in Mecca and ``in accordance with Islamic law.''   Condemned inmates in Saudi Arabia are usually beheaded by sword,often in public squares after Moslem prayers.   The defendants, who came to the kingdom in July as pilgrims,belonged to the Moslem Shiite sect and were of Iranian, Kuwaiti,Saudi and Qatari origin, according to the statement. They were allKuwaiti nationals.   The announcement said the defendants, who had been tried beforean Islamic court, gave full confessions. It said the confessionwould be broadcast on television.   The announcement said the defendents were tried for ``an evilcrime ... an aggression on the sanctity of the holy sites and on thepilgrims ... of the entire Moslem nation.''   The visit of senior Kuwaiti officials in recent weeks hadprompted reports that the Saudis were holding and interrogatingseveral Kuwaiti pilgrims.   The latest was a whirlwind visit Tuesday by the Kuwaiti ministerof state for foreign affairs, Saud al-Ossaimi, to relay a messagefrom the Kuwaiti leadership.   The Interior Ministry statement said the defendants brought theexplosives with them from Kuwait, where they also trained on usingthem.   It said they held meetings in Kuwait, Medina and Mecca to plantheir ``aggression,'' with the confessed aim of spreading ``terrorand fear in the hearts of the pilgrims ... and show that the (SaudiArabia) was unable to protect the house of God.''   It referred to their carrying out their crime ``at theinstructions of the unjust ones, who are enemies of this nation andfor all pilgrims of God's house, and cooperating with those unjustones on such debauchery and terrorism in the most sacred spot in theworld.''   The allusion was an apparent reference to Iran, which has beenurging Moslems pouring into Saudi Arabia for the annual Hajj toseize Mecca and Medina from the ruling Al Saud family.   The Saudi ruling dynasty is the custodian of the holy shrines,which are visited by Moslems as one of the five pillars of theirfaith.   Under the rule of the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, theIranian pilgrims tried to turn the Hajj into a political forum tospread his Islamic fundamentalist teachings.   The worst incidents occurred in the pilgrimage of 1987, when theIranian contingent clashed with Saudi security forces, leading tothe death of 402 pilgrims, most of them Iranians.   Riyadh severed ties with Iran the following April and gained theMoslem's world backing for restricting the number of pilgrims to1,000 people for each 1 million people of the sending nation'spopulation.   The Iranians boycotted the Hajj in 1988 and 1989 as a result andthere was a fierce war of words between Tehran and Riyadh.   Iran, however, has moved recently to improve ties with Gulf Arabnations including Saudi Arabia. A ``pragmatic'' camp in Tehran,headed by President Hashemi Rafsanjani, is trying to open Iran moreto the outside world.   It is opposed by radicals who view links with the pro-WesternSaudi rulers as anathema.   Kuwait itself has been a target of several acts of terrorism forwhich responsibility was laid on Khomeini's Iran. These actsincluded an attempt on the Kuwaiti ruler, Sheik Jaber al-Ahmedal-Sabah in 1985, and two years earlier the bomb blasts on the U.S.and French embassies in which five people were killed and 86 injured.   All these acts were also carried out by activists among Kuwait'sShiite Moslem minority, many of them identified as members of theanti-Iraqi underground Daawa party. The Shiites in Kuwait are mainlymembers of families that came from Iraq and Iran for livelihood inKuwait.</TEXT></DOC>
