Appoints Langdon President And Operating Chief </HL><SO> </SO><CO> TOPPC WNEWS </CO><DATELINE> NEW YORK  </DATELINE><TEXT>   John Jay Langdon was named president and chief operating officer of Topps Co., the maker of Bazooka bubble gum.    Mr. Langdon, 40 years old, had been senior vice president, brand management, for all of Mandamp;M Mars Confections at closely held Mars Inc., the big candy maker, before he was contacted by Topps, which is best known for its baseball cards.    Topps's &quot;best interests were served by going to the outside (for a president), where a host of requirements could be filled,&quot; said Arthur T. Shorin, the company's 53-year-old chairman.    Mr. Shorin said that he has &quot;been accused of being a one-man band&quot; and that although he thinks this characterization is harsh, the appointment of Mr. Langdon is in the &quot;spirit of partnership.&quot;    Mr. Langdon will take over day-to-day responsibility for domestic marketing, finance and personnel, according to Mr. Shorin, who Mr. Langdon succeeds as president. The operating chief's position is newly created.    The company has &quot;some really valuable and undermarketed&quot; possibilities for the Bazooka name, Mr. Shorin said, adding that as president, Mr. Langdon must be effective in managing the distractions of daily operations, while helping Mr. Shorin assess growth potential of ventures such as the marketing of Bazooka clothing or different packaging schemes.    Mr. Langdon couldn't be reached for comment. </TEXT></DOC>
