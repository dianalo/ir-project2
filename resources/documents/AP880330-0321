However, the company said that in the seven months prior togoing private it earned $90.1 million on revenues of $4.9 billion.Southland said it lost $149.7 million in the first five months ofits new operating structure.   In 1986, Southland earned $200.4 million on revenues of $7.8billion.   ``Southland's operating performance for the year was quitestrong, especially considering that the company undertook the mostextensive reorganization and cost-reduction program in its historyduring the fourth quarter,'' said Jere W. Thompson, Southlandpresident and chief executive officer.   In December, Southland completed its $4.9 billion leveragedbuyout by merging with JT Acquisition Corp., an affiliate of theThompson Co., the investment firm of the founding family.   In a leveraged buyout, a company is bought primarily withborrowed funds that are repaid with funds generated by the acquiredcompany's operations or through asset sales.   Southland owns about 7,000 7-Eleven stores and is the nation'slargest independent gasoline retailer with 50 percent interest inCitgo Petroleum Corp.   In reporting 1987 earnings, Southland divided the seven monthspreceding the company's buyout and merger activities from the fivemonths at the end of the year.   The company warned a clear comparison between the two earningsperiods is impossible because of the changed structure anddifferent accounting bases.   Southland said it does not expect to report a net profit ``forsome time'' because of interest costs to service the LBO-relateddebt and other factors.</TEXT></DOC>
