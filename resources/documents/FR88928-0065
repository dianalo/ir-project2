This amendment allows modification and extensionof existing electric transmission facilities which cross the U.S.-Canadianinternational border. These facilities are more fully described in the<T2>``SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION'' </T2>section of this notice and in thefinal environmental impact statement (EIS) titled, ``New England/Hydro-Quebecandplusmin;450 kV Transmission Line Interconnection_Phase II'', DOE/EIS-0129F.The availability of the final EIS above was announced in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> by ERA on November 13, 1987 (52 FR 43663). In reaching the decision to amend Presidential Permit PP-76, the DOE consideredthe environmental impacts associated with granting and not granting theamendment, as well as granting the amendment but requiring constructionalong alternative transmission line corridors. Under the alternative ofnot granting the amendment, various alternative power supply options whichthe applicant might take were considered. None of these alternatives orthe alternative transmission line corridors considered proved to be environmentallypreferable to granting the amendment for construction along the proposedroute. As a condition for granting the requested amendment, VETCO will be requiredto adopt all mitigation measures identified in the final EIS. In addition,any site-specific mitigation requirements identified during constructionwill be addressed by VETCO and coordinated with appropriate Federal, State,and local agencies. This amendment is available for public inspection and copying at the addressnoted at the end of the <T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION</T2> section of this notice.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2><ITAG tagnum="15">Anthony J.

Presidential Permit PP-76 authorized the construction, connection,operation, and maintenance of a andplusmin;450 kilovolt (kV), direct current(DC) transmission line, which crosses the U.S. international border nearNorton, Vermont and extends approximately 60 miles south, terminating ata converter station located in Monroe, New Hampshire. The purpose of theconverter station is to convert the DC power to alternating current (AC)power in order to permit integration with the existing New England AC transmissionsystem. These previously permitted facilities (known as Phase I) were placedin operation on October 1, 1986. The reliability condition imposed by thepermit limited the operation of the Phase I facilities to a maximum importlevel of 690 megawatts (MW). In its amendment application, VETCO sought permission to: (1) Constructa new DC/AC converter station at a site in the towns of Ayer and Groton,Massachusetts located adjacent to the Sandy Pond substation; (2) extendthe andplusmin;450 kV DC transmission line approximately 133 miles southalong existing transmission rights-of-way to the site of the new DC/ACconverter station; and (3) construct two new 345 kV AC transmission linesin order to integrate the proposed DC facilities with the existing AC transmissionsystem. One of the AC lines is to be constructed from the new converterstation to the existing Millbury No. 3 substation, located in Millbury,Massachusetts; the second 345 kV AC line is to be constructed between theMillbury No. 3 substation and the existing West Medway substation, locatedin Medway, Massachusetts. The above facilities are referred to as PhaseII and are proposed for operation by 1990. With the installation of the Phase II facilities, and as a result of anew firm energy contract between the New England utilities and Hydro-Quebec(signed on October 14, 1985), VETCO also is requesting that the combinationof the Phase I and Phase II facilities be permitted to operate up to amaximum level of 2000 MW of power transfer in the import mode. <ITAG tagnum="84">Description of Alternatives </ITAG>On November 13, 1987 (52 FR 43663), the ERA issued a final EIS titled,``New England/Hydro-Quebec andplusmin;450 kV Transmission Line Interconnection_PhaseII'', DOE/EIS-0129F. Section 2 of this document contains an analysis ofthe alternatives considered in this permit amendment evaluation, includingthree alternative corridors for routing the proposed transmission lines.The following alternatives were considered by DOE in reaching its decisionto grant the amendment to Presidential Permit PP-76: 1. Grant the amendment to the Presidential permit as requested. 2. Grant the amendment but require the use of alternative transmissioncorridors and converter station sites. (Three alternative corridors andsix converter sites were considered.) 3. Take no action_deny the amendment. Under this alternative the applicantcould choose to implement a number of alternative actions: (a) Make no changes in the facilities or operations of the system. (maintainstatus quo)(b) Construct and operate a new conventional central station generatingfacility. (non-oil-fired generating plant)(c) Refurbish older generating units.(d) Construct and operate nonconventional generating facilities. (solar,wind and biomass-powered facilities)(e) Institute conservation measures and load management.(f) Decentralize energy sources. (dispersed applications of various small-scaleenergy technologies, e.g., solar, wind, low-head hydroelectric installations,cogeneration, wood stoves)(g) Convert oil-fired generating units to the use of coal.(h) Purchase power from other utilities.(i) Construct the proposed extension underground.<ITAG tagnum="84">Basis for Decision</ITAG>Executive Order No. 10485, as amended by Executive Order No. 12038, authorizesthe ERA to grant a Presidential permit to construct, connect, operate andmaintain an electric transmission line which crosses the U.S. internationalborder if it is determined that issuance of the permit is in the publicinterest.ERA has concluded that the Phase II project proposed by VETCO satisfiesthe criteria presently used to determine consistency with the public interest,namely: 1) The project must not impair the reliability of the electricpower supply system in the U.S.; 2) the project must receive the favorablerecommendation of the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Defense;and 3) the DOE's decisionmaking process must satisfy the requirements ofthe National Environmental Policy Act of 1969.The Administrator of the ERA has determined that the installation and operationof the Phase II facilities (subject to certain operating conditions) wouldnot impair the reliability of the U.S. electric power supply system. Also,the Secretary of State by letter dated September 8, 1988, and the Secretaryof Defense by letter dated September 6, 1988, have concurred in the grantingof the amendment to Presidential Permit PP-76.The final EIS analyzed the environmental impacts of issuing or not issuingan amendment to Presidential Permit PP-76 that would result in (or preclude)the construction of certain new electric transmission facilities in NewHampshire and Massachusetts. It concluded that the issuance of the amendmentwould result in only very small incremental impacts in New England sincethe new transmission facilities would be constructed almost entirely onexisting rights-of-way within established transmission line corridors andadjacent to existing transmission lines.Construction activities, including clearing and control of vegetation,loss or alteration of wildlife habitat, displacement and/or disturbanceof wildlife, disturbance of aquatic resources, release of gaseous pollutantsand dust, and disruption of agricultural activities, would be minor andof short duration. Impacts from operation and maintenance of the transmissionfacilities, including collision of birds with structures, visual intrusionof an additional line within the transmission corridor, and possible healthand safety effects associated with the electromagnetic environment in closeproximity to the proposed line, would be minor and incremental in nature.If the DOE were to deny the amendment, the applicant could implement alternativeactions to obtain the necessary generating capacity and reduce the useof oil in the region. However, among the alternatives available to theapplicant (Alternatives 3a through 3i above) none were deemed to be viablealternatives to the proposed action.The ``maintain status quo'' alternative (Alternative 3a) would not providethe needed generating capacity and would result in greater air qualitydegradation due to the continued use of fossil fuels for electric generation.Installing new conventional generating units (Alternative 3b) would becostlier than the proposed action, could not be implemented in the requiredtime period, and could possibly result in greater environmental impactsthan the proposed action due to the increased thermal emissions from bothcoal-fired and nuclear units, and the increased combustion emissions fromcoal-fired units.The refurbishment of older generating units (Alternative 3c) could replacethe generating capacity provided by the proposed action. However, sincemost of the generating units which are candidates for refurbishment areoil-fired units, this would exacerbate the region's oil-dependence andpossibly contribute to higher electricity costs. Also, the environmentalimpacts of operating refurbished units likely would be greater than constructionof the proposed facilities. Each of the refurbished units would be burningoil with some resulting airborne emissions of sulfur dioxide and ash.The use of nonconventional generating facilities (Alternative 3d) was notconsidered to be a viable alternative to the proposed action because theoptimum technologies for the exploitation of these energy sources willnot be available in time to allow oil backout in the same quantity or timeframe as the proposed project.In evaluating the suitability of conservation and load management (Alternative3e), the peak demand forecast for the New England region already assumesa reduction in peak demand of 1000 MW by the year 2000 due to conservationand load management. Therefore, the benefits of the proposed action arein addition to any benefits derived from conservation and load management.Moreover, the proposed project does not preclude further pursuance of theseprograms.The application of decentralized energy sources, such as single-residencesolar, wind-electric generation, low-head hydro, cogeneration, and useof wood stoves for space heating (Alternative 3f) would be capable of reducingthe use of oil for electric generation in the New England region. However,full application of these technologies still would leave the New Englandregion sufficiently dependent upon oil-fired generation for the proposedproject to provide the anticipated fuel-cost savings and oil reduction.Conversion of existing oil-fired generating units to the use of coal (Alternative3g) is not a viable alternative because of scheduled plant retirements,site limitations, and/or economic considerations on the part of the utilitiesin New England. Furthermore, this alternative likely would result in greaterenvironmental impacts due to the thermal and airborne emissions causedby the combustion of coal.The purchase of electric energy from other U.S. utilities (Alternative3h) was not found to be a suitable alternative because this energy wouldnot be available in suficient quantities through the year 2000 and thedelivered cost of the energy would be almost double that of the energypurchased under the Phase II agreement. Furthermore, this alternative wouldhave similar environmental impacts since additional transmission lineswould need to be constructed through New York and Pennsylvania in orderto deliver the energy to the New England region.Construction of the proposed Phase II facilities underground (Alternative3i) was found to be more costly and to present greater environmental impactsthan the proposed action.The DOE also evaluated three alternative DC corridor routes and six alternativeconverter station sites. None of these corridors or converter station siteswas found to be environmentally preferable to the propsed route or site.<ITAG tagnum="84">Decision</ITAG>The DOE has determined that the issuance of an amendment to PresidentialPermit PP-76 is in the public interest. The DOE has reached this decisionafter determining that the issuance of the subject amendment was the mostenvironmentally preferred action among those alternatives considered inthe final EIS. However, since the environmental impacts associated withthe granting of this amendment were predicated on the implementation ofnumerous mitigative measures identified in the final EIS, issuance of thesubject amendment will be conditioned on VETCO implementing all mitigativemeasures identified in andSection; 2.1.5 and 4.1.10 of the final EIS.Copies of this Record of Decision and the amendment to Presidential PermitPP-76 will be made available, upon request, for public inspection and copyingat the Department of Energy's Freedom of Information Room, Room 1E-190,Forrestal Building, 1000 Independence Avenue, SW., Washington, DC 20585,from 9:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m., Monday through Friday.<ITAG tagnum="21">Issued in Washington, DC, on September 16, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Chandler L. van Orman,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Deputy Administrator, Economic Regulatory Administration.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="40">[FR Doc. 88-22220 Filed 9-27-88; 8:45 am]</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 6450-01-M</ITAG></ITAG></ITAG></TEXT></DOC>
