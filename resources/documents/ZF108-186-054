P.O. Box 6091 Incline Village,Nev.andP;  89450 Tel.andP;  800-548-4778 $895andM;The F77L-EM/32 language system from Lahey Computer Systems Inc. unlocks thefull capability of the Intel Corp. 80386 chip for MS-DOS FORTRAN programs.andM;The package includes a FORTRAN-77 standard compiler, linker, library managerand source code debugger.andP;  F77L-EM/32 uses the $195 OS/386 MS-DOS extendedfrom Eclipse Computer Solutions Inc. of Peabody, Mass., to run FORTRANprograms in the 386's native 32-bit mode.andM;Fast 386 computers offer the memory capacity and computational performanceFORTRAN applications demand; but this cannot be fully realized using MS-DOSor OS/2.andM;MS-DOS was designed to run on Intel 8088/8086 processors with their 1Maddress space.andP;  OS/2 supports large memory applications, but because OS/2 isdesigned for the 80286 rather than the 386, it uses slow segment/offsetaddressing.andP;  OS/386 is designed to use the 386's four-gigabyte flat addressspace.andP;  As a result the size of F77L-EM/32 applications is limited only bythe size of physical memory, which can be up to 16M on most 386 systems.andM;Minimum hardware for the F77L-EM/32 system is a 386 computer or an 8088 or286 system with Eclipse Computer Solutions' 386 HummingBoard installed.andM;The system must have at least 256K conventional and 1M extended RAM, alongwith a math coprocessor.andP;  The math coprocessor can be an Intel 287 or 387 ora system cannot compile or execute programs without one of these mathcorprocessors.andM;MS-DOS 3.0 or higher is required along with the OS/386 DOS extender.andP;  OS/386is available from Lahey or from Eclipse Computer Solutions (formerly A.I.andO;Architects).andM;The F77L-EM/32 compiler includes several extensions to the standard FORTRANlanguage described in Federal Information Processing Standard Publication69-1 (ANSI X3.9-1978).andP;  Lahey provides DO WHILE, END DO, INPUT and IMPLICITNONE statements and a NAMELIST input/output facility.andM;The compiler supports other intrinsic functions.andP;  It provides integer shiftand Boolean operations, functions for calculating addresses and a randomnumber generator.andP;  To make it easier to port FORTRAN applications to and frommainframes, Lahey has VAX and IBM VS FORTRAN intrinsic functions.andM;The package includes a library of FORTRAN-callable graphics functions whichallow the programmer to set colors, draw and fill lines, circles and boundedareas, and display text.andP;  The package supports CGA, EGA, VGA and Herculesgraphics adapters.andM;In addition to a well-organized manual, Lahey provides no-cost technicalsupport for registered users.andP;  Lahey technical support staff is available byphone, fax, telex or a bulletin board service.andM;I used F77L-EM/32 to compile and execute FORTRAN programs on a 33-MHz CompaqDeskpro/386 with Intel 80387 and Weitek 3167 Abacus math coprocessors.andP;  Theonly aspect of code the compiler objected to was a repeat count in a DATAstatement that was greater than 16,383.andP;  This documented limitation of thecompiler is an annoyance but can be worked around.andM;Longer CompilationsandM;The way F77L-EM/32 initializes variables in DATA statements is not so easy towork around, however.andP;  Rather than initializing them during linking like mostsystems, F77L-EM/32 initializes variables in DATA statements duringcompilation.andP;  This makes compiled object files large, and it also makescompilations take longer.andM;The F77L-EM/32 system shines when it comes to execution times, however.andP;  Icompiled and ran several programs using Lahey's 16-bit FORTRAN compiler(F77L-EM/16) and compared the execution times with those obtained usingF77L-EM/32.andM;The differences were pronounced.andP;  A program that initialized a 512K-elementREAL*4 array using two nested DO loops took 4.1 seconds to run in 16-bitmode, but only 0.8 seconds in 32-bit mode.andP;  The 32-bit code ran five timesfaster because the 16-bit code had to use twice as many instructions andmemory accesses to initialize the array elements.andM;Data initialization quirks aside, F77L-EM/32 is very useful.andP;  It lets aprogrammer develop and run large FORTRAN PROGRAMS on A 386 SYSTEM WITHOUT THECOMPLICATION and OVERHEAD OF A FULL 32-BIT NATIVE modE OPERATING SYSTEM SUCHAS UNIX.andM;Jim Shields is GCN's senior editor for technical features.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
