<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-04-0677 </DOCNO><TEXT>The simulation program presented makes it possible to calculate the demetallation(HDM) and desulphurization (HDS) conversions of heavy oils on catalystunder hydrogen pressure for various combinations of temperature, pressureand liquid hourly space velocity (LHSV). The simulation pattern presupposesthat the computer is fed with HDM, HDS, T, p and LHSV data from at leastone (test) run. This set of test data functions as a 'fingerprint' ofthe catalyst-oil-hydrogen-reactor system used. Included in the programis a routine for calculating the lifetime of the catalyst up to the pointof maximum metal uptake. This calculation is performed at the simulateddemetallation level from data on density, volumetric flow rate and metalcontent of oil, mass of catalyst in the reactor and maximum possiblemetal uptake of the catalyst. As the program is interactive, the usersupplies the data requested by the computer in a question-answer situation.The program is applicable in the ranges 320-420 degrees C, 5-15 MPa andLHSV 0.5-3.0 h{sup -1}. The test values of HDS and HDM should lie between10 and 100 wt%. 9 refs., 5 figs., 1 tab.</TEXT></DOC>
