Rep. Fernand J. St Germain, D-R.I., in a statement prepared forthe House floor, said he was not suprised by the Federal Home LoanBank Board's decision to defend the Federal Asset DispositionAssociation ``to it's final hour.''   St Germain, in a letter May 3, had asked Bank Board Chairman M.Danny Wall to dissolve FADA, a quasi-public agency created by thebank board three years ago.   St Germain has accused FADA of favoritism, conflicts of interestand mismanagement of the $4.2 billion in loans and real estate inits care.   Wall replied in a letter Friday that St Germain's criticisms``are historical in nature.''   ``The facts about FADA under its new management are markedlydifferent,'' Wall said, referring to Gerald P. Carmen, the formerdirector of the General Services Administration who took over asFADA chief executive in February.   Wall said staff reductions ordered by Carmen will save $2million a year. He argued that abolishing FADA would ``at a minimumcost millions of dollars ... create confusion (and) destroy thevalue to the system already created.''   ``I am confident that in the coming months you will see howsound the concept of FADA is and how much good will have come fromits new management,'' Wall told St Germain.   However, St Germain, noting his threat in the May 3 letter topush legislation abolishing FADA, said, ``We will proceed on thatcourse.''   ``Washington boondoggles have a life of their own and unlessthey are nipped in the bud they become part of the landscapeforevermore,'' St Germain said. ``FADA is at just such acrossroads.''   Reps. Paul Kanjorski, D-Pa., and Tom McMillen, D-Md., onWednesday planned to introduce legislation to dismantle FADA within60 days and return its functions to the Federal Savings and LoanInsurance Corp., the government insurance fund backing Sandamp;L depositsup to $100,000.</TEXT></DOC>
