Government and industry officials say the report listing Texaco'sPort Neches facility as the nation's worst cancer risk is flawed,but that hasn't convinced the neighbors whose fears it awakened.   ``Sure, I'm worried,'' said Michelle Thompson, 19, who learnedshe was pregnant the same week a congressman caused a stir byreleasing the 5-year-old Environmental Protection Agency list.   ``I have a son. I have one on the way. I don't want to livearound here if there's going to be a threat of cancer,'' she said.``I never even thought about the plant. I've only lived here a yearand it never even crossed my mind.'' Now, she says, she has talkedto her husband about leaving.   Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., released the report June 8 listingTexaco's butadiene plant as posing a one-in-10 risk of cancer.Though the ranking was hypothetical _ it was based on the chances ofcontracting cancer for a person living within 200 meters of theplant over a 70-year period _ it put Texaco's facility at the top ofa list of 205 plants around the country.   Government and industry officials said the data was outdated,based on assumptions and offered no real indication of cancer risk,and some have chided Waxman for prompting unnecessary public fear.   Measurements by Texas agencies sharply contradict the EPA report,which the EPA described as a priority guide to locating pollutantsand an inaccurate source of actual cancer risk.   State studies also show that cancer deaths in the area around theplant reflect statewide trends.   ``Certainly we're not saying that it's not a problem,'' saidMarcia Willhite, a toxicologist in the Texas Air Control Board'sresearch division. ``We have been looking at it in the past and plananother monitoring trip in the near future.   ``On the other hand, if I were living in Port Neches I would bepretty alarmed by some of the information I'm reading in thenewspaper,'' Ms. Willhite said. ``We just don't see them asreal-world estimates.''   Pearl Clark, whose mother died of cancer and husband isundergoing treatment for the disease, wonders if the EPA report maybe close to the truth.   ``I have no proof, but I have often wondered about theseplants,'' said Mrs. Clark, 57. ``I think everybody here haswondered.''   ``There used to be a lot more people around here, but they gotscared and moved out,'' said Violet Smith, who has lived across thestreet from the plant for 27 years. ``We were planning to go too,but we just couldn't afford it.''   The Texaco plant produces about 300,000 tons per year fbutadiene, an ethylene extract used in the production of rubber.Butadiene has been linked to leukemia and lymphomas.   Officials at the plant said its design, rather than emissions,affected the EPA ranking.   The EPA used a list provided by Texaco naming every possiblesource of leakage from the World War II-era plant, and then assumedleakage from every point in constructing what was essentially aworst-case model.   Texaco has been testing every possible source of leakage annuallysince 1986 and found few leaks, said Ray Fletcher, manager oftechnical services at the plant.   ``The number of actual emissions we have reported since then havebeen well within the accepted range ... and the number has decreasedevery year,'' Fletcher said.   On-site tests have never reflected a hazardous level ofemissions, Ms. Willhite said. A level of 220 micrograms per cubicmeter is used as a guideline for hazardous levels of butadiene, shesaid, but the highest level ever found near the Texaco plant was 20mpm in 1984.   The plant is facing possible fines for three nuisance violationsfrom odor complaints. A faint chemical odor is almost always in theair around Port Neches and nearby communities where petrochemicaldistilling towers dominate the skyline. Texas is home to 45 percentof the nation's petrochemical industry.   Texaco employs about 850 workers in the city of 14,000.   ``They're all worried about jobs, and they talk about plantsshutting down,'' said Mrs. Smith, recalling past layoffs. ``I know alot of them are concerned about losing their jobs, more so thancancer.''</TEXT></DOC>
