Profit rose to $92.8 million, or $2.88 a share, from $25.2 million, or 77 cents a share a year earlier. Fully diluted per-share earnings were $2.49 compared with 67 cents. The year-ago net income included a tax credit of $9.6 million. Sales rose 56% to $553.3 million from $355.3 million.    The copper producer credited its improved performance to higher copper prices, strong sales of carbon black products by its Columbian Chemicals Co. unit, and the inclusion of sales of Accuride Corp., a maker of truck wheels and rims that Phelps Dodge acquired in March.    In composite New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday, Phelps Dodge shares closed at $42.875, up 12.5 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
