The data was taken at the Pep-4/Time ProjectionChamber between 1983-1984. In particular we are interested in the productionof hadrons by the particle which mediates the strong interaction, thegluon. We find that the number of protons produced by the fragmentationof the gluon is at variance with the LUND model of fragmentation. 85refs., 72 figs., 29 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
