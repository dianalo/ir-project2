Japanese authorities said first reports of the March 8 accidentdid not emerge until Monday, when 35 survivors of the accident onthe high seas between Vietnam and Malaysia arrived in the port ofYokohama. News agencies in Malaysia said Thursday that floatingbodies were sighted off Malaysia.   It was the latest reported accident involving the increasingnumber of Vietnamese fleeing political repression and economichardship in the communist country. The refugees, known as boatpeople, risk piracy and disaster in hopes of achieving asylum andpermanent resettlement outside Vietnam.   Surviving refugees said the boat collided with the 239,000-tonNissei-Maru and sank, but the tanker's captain said he believed awave capsized the boat.   Survivors said their boat was carrying 165 people. A Nagasakirefugee center official, Masanami Nakatsukasa, said the boat hadleft Long An in southern Vietnam on March 4.   Many passengers were seasick and were suffering from a lack offresh water after four days at sea, and they had been trying toapproach the tanker for help, the official quoted survivors assaying.   ``The tanker came very close to our boat, and the waves pushed usinto the ship,'' survivor Chan Kin Kan told the Japan BroadcastingCorp. late Thursday.   ``Our boat capsized. The children and others trapped in the boatwere drowned,'' Chan said.   The boat overturned and sank after hitting the propeller at theback of the Nissei-Maru, the refugee official quoted survivors assaying.   The tanker captain, Yasuo Kawamura, had stopped and preparedladders to take the refugees on board. He said in a TV interviewthat the reason for the sinking was unclear.   ``I couldn't see it with my own eyes, but we were completelystopped, so I don't think we hit the boat,'' Kawamura said. ``Ithink their boat was capsized when it was hit broadside by a wave.''   Hiroshi Hattori, spokesman for Tokyo Tanker, the Nissei-Maru'sagent, also denied reports of a collision. He said the tanker crewdid not know how many refugees were missing after the accident.   Reports that 165 refugees had been crammed into the boat were``unbelievable,'' said Seichiro Okamoto, head of ocean operationsfor Tokyo Tanker.   The Nissei-Maru conducted an all-day search and rescued 35refugees, then sailed for Singapore, where the refugees were refusedentry, news reports said.   The refugees were brought to Yokohama on another Japanese vesselafter Japan granted them entry, said Chikako Saito, spokeswoman forthe U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees in Tokyo.   Maritime Safety Agency spokesman Kazuhiro Numata said TokyoTanker had not mentioned any missing, reporting only the rescue of35 refugees.   The agency, Japan's coast guard, will send officials to therefugee center where the 35 survivors are staying to investigate theaccident, Numata said.   Saito said the refugees will become Japanese residents unlessthey have close relatives in third countries.   Foreign Ministry spokesman Taizo Watanabe said his ministryviewed the case as ``a really serious issue,'' but could not commentuntil the coast guard completed its investigation.   In Malaysia, decomposed bodies sighted by fishermen in the seasoff northeast Malaysia were believed to be those of the refugees,police said.   The body of a girl found on a northeast Malaysian beach Tuesdayalso is believed to be one of the drowned refugees, Trengganu statePolice Chief Wan Razak Muda told the national news agency Bernama.   There are 16,500 Vietnamese refugees in Malaysian camps, morethan 750 who arrived since March 14, Bernama said.   Last year, more than 45,000 boat people landed in Southeast Asiancountries, compared with fewer than 30,000 in 1987.   Under a new policy by the Association of Southern Asian nations,recently arrived boat people will be put into temporary camps andscreened to determine if they are genuine refugees fleeing forpolitical purposes or just economic refugees seeking a better lifein the West.   The economic refugees are returned to Vietnam. So far no one hasbeen deported from Malaysia.   U.N. officials also are trying to stem to exodus. They plan tostress the advantages of the 10-year-old ``Orderly DepartureProgram,'' under which 23,000 people were flown from Vietnam lastyear, most for resettlement in the United States and Australia.</TEXT></DOC>
