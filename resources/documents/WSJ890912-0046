Some lawyers watching the show shook their heads at the comments made by U.S. Attorney Robert Barr Jr., whose office is prosecuting the case against Mr. Martinez, alleged money man for the Medellin cocaine cartel who was arraigned in Atlanta on two counts of laundering millions of dollars in the U.S.    Mr. Barr &quot;made statements . . . on the case and the evidence that have prejudiced potential jurors beyond repair,&quot; says Ira London, who unsuccessfully represented Joel Steinberg in the much-publicized trial over the death of his adopted daughter earlier this year.    Within hours of the broadcast, federal Judge William O'Kelley issued an order prohibiting lawyers involved from talking about the Martinez case. Mr. Barr won't comment on his TV appearance.    Judge O'Kelley might well be worried. Even without any additional problems that may be caused by the prosecutor's comments, the judge will face a tough challenge conducting a fair trial in such an emotional and highly publicized case.    Mr. Martinez's arraignment, on the heels of his extradition from Colombia and President Bush's declaration of war on drugs last week, highlights a troublesome criminal-justice issue: Can a defendant in such a case get a fair trial?    The Sixth Amendment of the Constitution guarantees the right of defendants to a trial by unbiased people who judge the case only on the evidence produced. But getting a fair trial in the age of TV, and in a period of public concern about drugs, is far trickier than it was when the framers of the Constitution put pen to paper.    &quot;I'm not sure I can remember a case where there's been such a saturation of publicity nationally, and such prejudicial publicity,&quot; says Neal Sonnett, president of the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers and counsel to Gen. Manuel Noriega of Panama. For Mr. Martinez, he says, getting a fair trial is going to be &quot;damn difficult. There's such a climate of near hysteria about drugs and crime in general that I think it's hard for juries to understand the presumption of innocence.&quot;    Not surprisingly, it is defense lawyers who express the most skepticism about prospects of an untainted trial for Mr. Martinez, who pleaded innocent to the charges and was ordered held without bail.    &quot;I have real doubts that the Sixth Amendment promise of a fair trial can be accomplished for a Colombian accused of a major drug offense,&quot; says Edward Shohat, a Miami defense lawyer. Mr. Shohat represented Carlos Lehder, a Medellin cartel leader now serving a life sentence. He believes it is impossible to find prospective jurors who do not have strong feelings about drugs -- and drug defendants. In the 1987 Lehder case, he adds, &quot;Each and every seated juror had something that was objectionable.&quot;    Mr. Shohat is so embittered by his experience that he says Mr. Martinez should be sent home to Colombia if it becomes impossible to empanel an impartial jury.    Prosecutors and defense lawyers agree that the burden of preserving a defendant's Sixth Amendment rights falls largely on the judge. It is the judge who sets the limits on voir dire -- the questioning and selection of jurors.    Professor Alan Dershowitz of Harvard Law School says the best kind of judge for such a case is one &quot;who has guts or a judge who is very old.&quot; Young and ambitious judges are the worst kind for sensitive cases, he says, because they cannot risk alienating public opinion.    Burton Roberts, the New York State Supreme Court justice who was the model for the abrasive judge in Tom Wolfe's &quot;The Bonfire of the Vanities,&quot; says a good judge can put on a fair trial &quot;by the force and dint of his personality.&quot;    In federal courts, jury selection is usually a brief affair, but judges can allow surveys of jurors and extensive questioning by the lawyers. Even cynical defense lawyers think probing questions can winnow out prejudiced jurors.    William Weld, former head of the Justice Department's criminal division, says the way to compensate for prejudicial pretrial publicity is to gain a delay and, if necessary, move the trial to a new location.    But Mr. Martinez's lawyer, Edward Garland, said, &quot;He will get as fair a trial {in Atlanta} as he can get anywhere in the country. The question is: Can he get a fair trial, period? And that will be one of the issues addressed in the trial.&quot;    Indeed, many defense lawyers say that if they were in the shoes of Mr. Garland, they would stall in the hope that the drug crisis fades in the public consciousness.    Whatever approach Mr. Garland takes, the Justice Department appears confident nothing will interfere with Mr. Martinez's right to a fair trial. Mr. Barr insists he will be treated like any other defendant. </TEXT></DOC>
