This coming season, though, the venerableCosby is getting some stiff competition from Peter Pan,Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and the New Kids on the Block.   After years of talking about the spending power of kids,advertisers are finally betting real money to try to proveit. Advertisers that used to ignore the kids' market arewaking up and discovering after-school and Saturday morningTV. &quot;Up-front&quot; sales of network ad time for kids' programmingballooned for the coming season, fueled by new advertisersranging from microwave dinners to fastfood chains. The bigjump came even as prime-time ad sales fell short ofexpectations. Kiddie cable and syndicated kid shows hadblockbuster ad sales too.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;The influence on spending by kids has become apparent toeverybody, and that's the reason there's more money foreveryone,&quot; says Paul Rittenberg, vice president of daytimeand kids' sales for Capital Cities/ABC's network. Despitemounds of research and years of lecturing by ad industrygurus on kids' buying power, he says, &quot;it's taken a while tosink into the ad agency planning process.&quot;   Anyone up early enough to catch the Saturday morningcartoons on TV this fall will find a new group of advertisersjoining the usual candy, cereal and toy hawkers. Adexecutives say microwave foods, such as Tyson Foods' newLooney Tune meals for kids, are becoming major spenders. Soare sneaker companies that apparently have decided they hadbetter hook the kids before they grow into brand-obsessedteens. And Burger King is making a major new kids' push, inan aggressive bid to invade McDonald's warm-and-fuzzy RonaldMcDonald turf, ad executives say.   Adding to the spending spree, traditional toy companiesare beefing up their ad budgets this year, people in theindustry say.   The kids' market has a &quot;relatively small number ofadvertisers,&quot; says Jerry Dominus, senior vice president ofentertainment marketing and sales for CBS. &quot;When you have keyplayers stepping up spending, and add in a few totally newcontenders, it really ratchets up the market.&quot;   Loretta Volpe, senior vice president and director of mediaand marketing services for ad agency Griffin Bacal, whoseclients include Hasbro, Playskool and Milton Bradley, adds:&quot;This was one of the craziest kid marketplaces of any time.It just exploded.&quot;   All told, the kid-show boom adds up to tens of millions ofnew kiddie-TV dollars. Industry executives estimate that thethree major networks brought in a total of $155 million to$165 million for this fall's kids' TV ad time, up sharplyfrom about $135 million a year earlier. On top of that, NewsCorp.'s Fox network is offering its first kids' lineup,including a daily animated Peter Pan cartoon and severalSaturday morning shows, that ad executives estimate took inan additional $30 million. And this fall, ABC will roll out anew animated New Kids on the Block show.   Meanwhile, syndicated kiddie shows, aired on independentstations and network affiliates, saw an equally powerful adsurge. That market was propelled largely on the strength of&quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot; and Buena Vista Television'snew two-hour kiddie schedule called &quot;Disney Afternoon.&quot;   The Disney shows, aired Monday through Friday andincluding the popular &quot;Chip 'n' Dale's Rescue Rangers&quot; and&quot;Duck Tales,&quot; proved to be some of the strongest contendersin the kiddie market. Mark Zoradi, vice president and generalmanager of Buena Vista Television, says the four shows in thetwo-hour block pulled in $71 million in upfront ad sales.   That would make Buena Vista a bigger player than any ofthe three major networks. Industry executives estimate thatABC was the biggest network player, with about $65 million inupfront sales, followed by CBS with $50 million to $55million, and then General Electric Co.'s NBC with $40 millionto $45 million.   Certainly, advertisers had reasons for moving money intothe kids' market other than just deciding the ad industry'sresearch departments were right about kids after all. Forone, prime time has gotten stratospherically expensive: &quot;Thenetworks keep seeing an erosion in ratings, but the pricesdon't go down. The kids' market is so much less expensive,&quot;Griffin Bacal's Ms. Volpe says. She also credits the catfightshaping up among the networks, Disney's powerhouse programsand upstart contender Fox.   At its heart, though, the boom in the kiddie marketsuggests that advertisers are finally realizing just howtight a hold on the family pursestrings kids really have. Notonly do kids personally spend about $4 billion in allowancemoney each year, estimates Children's Market Research Group,a New York-based research firm, but they influence families'decisions on another $60 billion worth of purchases --everything from vacations to computers.   &quot;I'm beginning to get calls from advertisers who arerecognizing it's both the parents and the children who makedecisions,&quot; says Selina Guber, Children's Market Researchpresident. And while she has been preaching about kids'spending power for years, she adds, the advertisers' interest&quot;is definitely a recent trend.&quot;   ---   FCB Wins Coors Job                                                                                                          Coors Brewing Co. pulled its estimated $20 million to $25million Coors Extra Gold account from GSDandamp;M and handed it toFoote, Cone andamp; Belding, Chicago.   Golden, Colo.-based Coors wouldn't say what prompted theswitch of the big beer account. A spokeswoman would only saythat the move resulted after a &quot;periodic agency reviewprocess,&quot; adding, &quot;We're fortunate to have agencies that arevery talented, and we need to draw resources from them asneeded.&quot;   The win is a big addition to the Coors business at FooteCone, the shop that already handles ads for the company'sCoors Light, Keystone and Killian's Red brands. New ads forCoors Extra Gold are expected to begin airing in December.   GSDandamp;M, in Austin, Texas, continues to handle the adaccount for the regular Coors brand and Hispanic adresponsibilities for Coors and Coors Light brands.   ---   Ad Notes. . . .
