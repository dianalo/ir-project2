If the University of Pittsburgh succeeds in efforts to block organizing of a faculty union by arguing that professors really are managers, teachers union officials warn of a consequence: Teachers may retreat from their growing duties as mentors and advisers in order to avoid undermining their union. The outcome at the state university site in Pittsburgh could set a precedent for public schools, &quot;chilling efforts to professionalize teaching,&quot; says the head of the Florida Education Association United.    Los Angeles union officials strive to keep teacher-management programs from affecting collective bargaining. In Rochester, N.Y., a recent contract gave teachers more management authority but union leaders say members will avoid the popular programs if they affect the union's status.    Faculty unions are rare at private colleges because of a 1980 Supreme Court ruling that professors at one such school were managers.    MANY STATE EMPLOYEES will get pay boosts after an era of tight budgets.    Raises for state workers will range from 3% to 6% in 20 states during fiscal years starting this fall, while many other states will provide merit increases, says the National Association of State Budget Officers. By contrast, cost-cutting measures were widespread in the past few years. States still try to control benefit costs by encouraging early retirement. But hiring freezes and layoffs are becoming more rare.    Belts may be loosened even in states that depend on oil, gas and coal revenue. Texas workers will get a 2% raise, and Oklahoma has budgeted 2.5% merit-pay boosts for about half of its employees. Wyoming will give workers a 4% increase; New Mexico will boost state employees' pay 3%.    SUMMER JOBS: Theme parks and restaurants offer incentives to attract help.    Opryland USA, which needs 3,200 summer workers, will sponsor employee dances and a chance to win $1,000 scholarships. Beach parties and free tickets to Atlanta Braves games help make Six Flags Over Georgia a &quot;very socially-oriented place&quot; for young workers, a spokesman says. Six Flags Over Texas in Arlington throws parties and gives free admission to workers' families.    A Gurnee, Ill., amusement park sends recruiting teams to senior citizen centers, high schools and colleges. Four company-owned McDonald's restaurants in suburban Atlanta share a full-time recruiter, who says she'll seek referrals from current employees and leave applications on tables.    A Church's Fried Chicken manager in San Antonio considers printing help-wanted ads on the placemats on trays.    COLLEGE GRADUATES in 1985 began their careers earning 55% more than high-school graduates, says a University of Chicago study. In 1980, college degrees were worth only 27% more in the early years on the job. The extra earning power may reflect the demand for better-educated workers in a service-based economy, one of the researchers says.    CURBING DOCTORS' FEES for services to Medicare patients could be the next health-cost issue faced by Congress, predicts the Employee Benefit Research Institute, a nonprofit group. Federal costs for the Medicare insurance program covering doctors' fees have risen more than 14% annually in eight of the past nine years.    WORKING WOMEN who give birth without leave policies guaranteeing their old jobs back forgo $607 million in income annually, says a recent study by the Institute for Women's Policy Research. A General Accounting Office study estimates that a federal parental-leave law would cost employers $102 million a year.    BARGAINING BEGINS this week between the Village Voice and the National Writers Union, which hopes to win a contract with one of the nation's largest employers of free-lance writers. In addition to the union's recognition, 200 non-staff writers for the Voice hope to win a standardized payment schedule. Some Voice workers are already unionized.    ANCHORAGE CUTS health-plan costs 10% with help from its union.    City officials decided the best way to cut the costs was to get the union to help devise a plan. The goal: to save about 10% in 1987 without reducing the plan's coverage. The prescription wasn't new -- it called for reducing the number of hospital admissions for surgery and seeking more second opinions from doctors -- but the effort to win its acceptance was intense.    The union took two months to explain the plan to members and submitted it to a vote. Ignoring the guidelines means only 50% of a worker's health costs are paid. &quot;Requiring a second opinion doesn't do any good if people don't understand the whole program,&quot; says a partner with Mercer-Meidinger-Hansen, a benefit consulting firm that worked with the city.    City officials say the effort made it easier to propose other cost-cutting measures during current contract negotiations.    THE CHECKOFF: Britain's Chancellor of the Exchequer last week proposed doubling the tax employees pay for the use of a company car. . . . Farmers working in swine facilities have a higher rate of respiratory ailments because dust from feed, dried manure and pieces of pigs' skin can lodge in the lungs, the University of Kentucky says. </TEXT></DOC>
