This may be theonly solution in many cases because piped gas or cabled electricity willnever reach some of those communites. Villages powered by renewable energynow exist all over the world. Depending on their needs and resources,the modes of renewable energy used in different places are different.This paper deals with the decision process of selecting certain mix ofrenewable energy systems, in which one or more technologies will be utilizedfor certain projects depending on the location and profile of energyrequirements. Energy modes considered include photovoltaic, wind, smallhydro, biogas and/or solar thermal. Design considerations and criteriaare listed in a methodical way to assist the potential project developedin deciding the feasibility of the proposed project. Starting from considerationsof meteorological and atmospheric databanks and combined resource maps,the designer has to consider diversity and profiles of loads, load factors,future trends, and emerging technologies. Formulae for different energysolutions for a remote community are mentioned, and environmental effectsand costs examined. 12 refs., 4 figs., 2 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
