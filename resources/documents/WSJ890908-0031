The official, Uzi Ruskin, owns about 1.2 million of United Merchants' 9.1 million shares. The company said its board had authorized Mr. Ruskin to &quot;attempt to develop such a proposal&quot; and would pay him reasonable legal and other fees.    The company said the proposal may hinge on continued availability of tax-loss carry-forwards, which totaled about $200 million in fiscal 1988.    The company said the investing group may include Menachem Atzmon, beneficial owner of about 4% of the company's shares.    Directors also will consider alternative proposals and the board has appointed a special committee to consider proposals.    United Merchants, which designs, makes and markets textiles, clothing and accessories, had a net loss of $14.9 million on $125.5 million in sales for the third fiscal quarter ended March 31. </TEXT></DOC>
