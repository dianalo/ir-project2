Even though the decision will continue steel quotas beyond their scheduled Sept. 30 expiration date, the administration described Mr. Bush's decision as &quot;a steel liberalization program.&quot; Officials said the extension would allow a transition to open markets in steel and give the U.S. steel industry more time to continue modernization efforts.    &quot;This program is designed to restore free-market forces to, and end government interference in, global trade in steel,&quot; the president said.    Major domestic steelmakers were disappointed that President Bush hadn't opted to extend trade restraints for five years, as they had sought. They contend the shorter extension period won't give them the time or incentive to make what they consider critical capital improvements.    The nation's increasingly vocal steel users applauded the decision, though. &quot;We're very pleased,&quot; said Jon Jenson, a spokesman for the Coalition of American Steel Using Manufacturers. &quot;We believe the president's decision is a reasonable compromise between the interests of U.S. steel producers and U.S. steel users.&quot;    The steel quotas, called &quot;voluntary restraint agreements,&quot; currently limit steel imports to about 18.4% of the U.S. market. Established five years ago because of widespread foreign subsidies and &quot;dumping&quot; of low-priced steel in the U.S., they now are scheduled to expire no later than March 31, 1992. Dumping is the practice of selling in a foreign market at prices below the cost of production or the prices in the home market.    Mr. Bush said the overall ceiling on imports could be increased during the next two and a half years at an annual rate of one percentage point. The administration could delay the increase, however, to support its attempts to achieve an international consensus on steel. Moreover, U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills said the increase would be allocated &quot;on a first-come, first-served basis to countries that commit to removing trade-distorting practices.&quot;    The president's program will give Mrs. Hills some leverage in her coming negotiations with the 29 countries that supply steel to the U.S. under voluntary restraint agreements. She will be able to use the annual increase in the quota ceiling to reward freer traders in steel.    President Bush pledged during his election campaign to extend the nation's steel quotas, pending international action to remove barriers to trade in steel. Technically, the extension has to be negotiated with foreign steel suppliers, but it is unlikely that any will refuse to agree to the extension.    The president also instructed the Commerce Department to liberalize and streamline &quot;short supply arrangements,&quot; which allow quotas to be bypassed when steel shortages arise. Requests for such action normally will be processed within 30 days; and in cases involving steel products that aren't domestically produced or for which domestic output is exceeding 90% of capacity, there will be a 15-day procedure. In addition, the burden of proof in cases involving short supply will shift to the steel producer from the steel consumer.    Some steelmakers have announced multimillion-dollar capital-spending projects that they said hinged on five more years of the voluntary restraint accords. Allegheny Ludlum Corp., a Pittsburgh-based specialty steelmaker, said in May it would boost capital outlays by $25 million if the quotas were extended for five years.    It is unclear whether steelmakers will begin dismantling any capital-improvement programs. Armco Inc., for example, said outlays scheduled to improve plants will be necessary regardless.    Armco praised the decision to apply the import restraints on all major product groups -- including specialty steel. The company also lauded Mr. Bush for his intention to correct market distortions through an international agreement.    &quot;But we're concerned that there's not enough time in the extension to get the job done,&quot; the company said. Armco said it fears that at the end of the 30-month extension, the industry may once again see &quot;high levels of imports and another rash of trade case filings.&quot; And the steelmaker said it wouldn't be surprised then if another extension is urged.    The president's decision is something of a victory for Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady and Michael Boskin, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers. They had argued for an extension of only two years, according to administration officials, and had urged that the administration seek to restore freer trade in the international steel market.    The Commerce Department, and to a lesser extent the trade representative's office, favored a longer extension -- possibly coupled with some easing of the program in later years -- pending the removal of subsidies and trade barriers maintained by other steel-producing nations.    Howard M. Love, chairman and chief executive officer of National Intergroup Inc., which owns 50% of National Steel Corp., said two and a half years &quot;appears to be a very short time to satisfactorily negotiate&quot; an international consensus to end unfair and illegal subsidies of foreign steel.    Richard P. Simmons, chairman of Allegheny Ludlum and the Specialty Steel Industry trade group, also said the administration may have too little time to negotiate such an accord, &quot;given the pervasive nature of these practices in so many countries.&quot;    Privately, steelmakers questioned whether they will spend as aggressively as they have in the past several years to modernize old steel facilities. Peter Marcus, an analyst with PaineWebber Inc., said that &quot;since capital spending in large part is based on confidence, all things being equal, the shorter period would lead to lower capital spending than if the industry had a longer period.&quot;    But other industry executives and analysts said they wonder whether the threats of reducing capital spending were idle. Charles Bradford, an analyst with Merrill Lynch Capital Markets, said: &quot;You don't spend for the short-term protection. You spend money if you need facilities.&quot; Indeed, Weirton Steel Corp. Chairman Herbert Elish said the company will continue to move forward with a five-year, $650 million capital plan of modernizing facilities.    Meanwhile, Caterpillar Inc., a big steel user that has lobbied hard against the steel quotas, hailed the president's actions. &quot;They improve competition, focus on removing trade barriers and also give a date certain when quotas will end,&quot; said William Lane, a senior trade specialist for the company. </TEXT></DOC>
