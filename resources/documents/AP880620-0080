By a vote of 8-1, the justices said a suit by the StewartOrganization of Birmingham, Ala., against the Ricoh Corp., aleading copy machine maker with headquarters in West Caldwell,N.J., may be tried in federal court in New York City.   The Stewart company had a contract with Ricoh to sell its copymachines in central Alabama. It accused Ricoh in a 1984 federallawsuit of breaching the contract and other violations.   The contract between the two companies contained a clause thatsaid any such dispute between them must be tried in federal courtin New York City, where Ricoh conducts much of its corporateactivities.   The Stewart firm sued in federal court in Alabama and a judge,relying on state law, ruled that the case should be tried inAlabama.   But the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, based in Atlanta,Ga., overturned the judge's ruling and transferred the case tofederal court in New York City. The appeals court said federal law,rather than Alabama law, takes precedence.   The Supreme Court agreed that federal judges may disregard statelaws in such instances and may assign cases to whatever locationsare best suited to the convenience of the opposing sides andwitnesses ``in the interest of justice.''   Justice Thurgood Marshall, writing for the court, said thefederal law properly leaves it up to judges to decide where caseswill be tried.   But the ruling leaves open the possibility that the case stillcould be tried in Alabama if lower courts decide that would be themost convenient forum.   Justice Antonin Scalia dissented.   The case is Stewart Organization vs. Ricoh Corp., 86-1908.</TEXT></DOC>
