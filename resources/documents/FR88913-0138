To qualify for retroactive TAA benefits, petitions must be received inthe Office of Trade Adjustment Assistance, Employment and Training Administration,601 D Street NW., Room 6434, Washington, DC 20213, by close of businesson Friday, November 18, 1988. 2. <T3>References. </T3>Trade Act of 1974 (Pub. L. 93-618), as amended bythe OTCA, sections 1421(a)(1)(A) and 1421(a)(1)(B) of the OTCA, enactedon August 23, 1988.  3. <T3>Background. </T3>This General Administration Letter addresses the amendmentto section 222 of the Act by section 1421(a)(1)(A)(iii) which expands thescope of eligibility for TAA to workers employed with firms in the oiland natural gas industry engaged in exploration or drilling, and the specialprovision in section 1421(a)(1)(B) of the OTCA, which gives such workersa one-time opportunity to file a petition for TAA within 90 days of enactment.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Rescissions:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Distrubution: </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Expiration Date: August 31, 1989The amendment by section 1421(a)(1)(A) of OTCA adds a mew subsection (b)to section 222 of the Trade Act, providing_<ITAG tagnum="21">``(b) For purpose of subsection (a)(3)_</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">``(1) The term `contributed importantly' means a cause which is importantbut not necessarily more important than any other cause. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">``(2)(A) Any firm, or appropriate subdivision of a firm, that engagesin exploration or drilling for oil or natural gas shall be considered tobe a firm producing oil or natural gas. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">``(B) Any firm, or appropriate subdivision of a firm, that engagesin exploration or drilling for oil or natural gas, or otherwise producesoil or natural gas, shall be considered to be producing articles directlycompetitive with imports of oil and with imports of natural gas''.</ITAG>The special provision of section 1421(a)(1)(B) of OTCA provides:<ITAG tagnum="21">``(B) Notwithstanding section 223(b) of the Trade Act of 1974, orany other provision of law, any certification made under subchapter A ofchapter 2 of title II of such Act which_ </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">``(i) is made with respect to a petition filed before the date thatis 90 days after the date of enactment of this Act, and </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">``(ii) would not have been made if the amendment made by subparagraph(A) had not been enacted into law, </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">``shall apply to any worker whose most recent total or partial separationfrom the firm, or appropriate subdivision of the firm, described in section222(a) of such Act occurs after September 30, 1985.''</ITAG>Prior to the OTCA, workers employed by independent firms in the oil andnatural gas industry engaged in exploration and drilling did not qualifyfor TAA because the employing firms provided a service and did not producean article (i.e. oil or natural gas) as required by section 222(3) (nowsection 222(a)(3)) of the Trade Act for certification. The Conference Reportstated that exploration, drilling, and production activities in the crudeoil and natural gas industries are inextricably linked. Therefore, workersof firms engaged in exploration, drilling, or production of either crudeoil or natural gas shall be considered as producing either product. The amendment and special provision expands the scope of eligibility forTAA to workers in the oil and natural gas industry employed by independentfirms engaged in exploration and drilling and provides retroactive TRAbenefits (but not retroactive additional weeks of TRA under section 233(a)(3)of the Trade Act) to such workers who were separated from employment insuch firms after September 30, 1985, provided that the other criteria forcertification are met under the amended section 222(a) of the Trade Act.However, Conference Report states the conferees do not intend that certificationof workers from independent firms engaged in exploration or drilling serveas a basis for certifying workers from producing firms to which such explorationor drilling workers provide services if such production workers have notpetitioned for such certification.  For purposes of implementing the amendment, the Conference Report identifiesfirms engaged in exploration or drilling as including ``for example, independentdrillers, pumpers, seismic and geophysical crews, geological crews, andmud companies.'' Petitions from workers of firms that manufacture oil fieldmachinery will continue to be processed and determinations issued basedon imports of like or directly competitive articles. However, as the languageof the amended section 222(b)(2)(B) makes clear, to satisfy the eligibilitycriterion of the amended section 222(a)(3), any such firm must be one that``<T3>engages in exploration or drilling </T3>for oil and natural gas, orotherwise produces oil or natural gas * * *.'' (Emphasis added.) Therefore,an independent mud company which merely supplies mud to a company which``engages in exploration or drilling for oil or natural gas * * *.'', butdoes not itself do so, does not meet the eligibility criterion of the amendedsection 222(a)(3), and its workers may not be certified on this basis.A special provision in section 1421(a)(1)(B) is given retroactive effectby eliminating the one-year impact date in section 223(b), so that certificationperiods will cover separations back to October 1, 1985, and by settingaside the 60-day preclusion provision in section 231(a). This special provisionapplies <T3>only </T3>to workers of firms within the coverage of section 222(b)of the Trade Act as added by section 1421(a) of the OTCA, that is, workersof any firm that ``engages in exploration or drilling for oil and naturalgas, or otherwise produces oil or natural gas * * *.'' Becausethe period for workers in the oil and gas industry to file an <T3>original petition, </T3>or <T3>re-petition </T3>if previously denied certification, ends on November18, 1988, such workers should be properly informed of these statutory provisionsand given an opportunity to file a petition. The full cooperation and participationof State agencies are needed to inform the workers, and assist them infiling petitions as required in section 222. Other provisions in the OTCA affecting the TAA program, and operating instructionsto States for implementing those provisions will be covered in separatecommunications. 4. <T3>Actions Required. </T3>SESAs should take the following actions:(a) Inform staff of the amendments to section 222 of the Trade Act of 1974,and the special provision in section 1421(a)(1)(B), of OTCA, and the impactof the amendment and special provision on workers of firms in the oil andnatural gas industry engaged in exploration or drilling.(b) Inform oil and natural gas industry workers engaged in drilling orexploration, who were separated after September 30, 1985, through pressreleases to print and radio media in areas where workers reside, of theone-time opportunity to file by November 18, 1988, an original petitionor to re-petition the Department for TAA benefits and services as authorizedin section 1421(a)(1)(B).(c) Seek out workers and worker groups with oil and natural gas explorationor drilling firms who previously filed petitions and denied TAA eligibilityand provide them with information on the amendment and one-time filingprovision. (The Regional Office will provide SESAs with a listing of workergroups previously denied eligibility by the Department and other informationfor use in initiating worker notices.)(e) Assist workers totally or partially separated from oil and gas explorationand drilling firms after September 30, 1985, to file timely petitions foradjustment assistance.(f) Workers should be instructed to mail petitions to the Office of TradeAdjustment Assistance, Employment and Training Administration, 601 D Street,NW., Room 6434, Washington, DC 20213.
