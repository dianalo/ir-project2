Followingexploration over an area of some 130 sq.km, a significant potentiallymineable coal resource was identified within five coal seams of Mioceneage. This total mineable-in-situ resource of 147 million tonnes (Mt)is subdivided into 'opencast' coal (39 Mt) and 'underground' coal (108Mt) with the latter being further subdivided on the basis of seam thickness(andgt;2.00m:7.6 Mt; 1.50-2.00m:53.9 Mt; 1.20-1.50m:46.5Mt). Coal rank iswithin the sub-bituminous A range of the ASTM classification. The coalhas a medium to high sulphur content (average 3.2% air dried basis(a.d.b.)and a high ash content (average 9.9% a.d.b.). Specific energy valuesrange from 20.1 to 25.7 MJ/kg and average 23.1 MJ/kg (or 9,910 Btu/lba.d.b.). A preliminary mining study identified Retreat Longwall as beingthe preferred main method for mining the underground coal, with truckand shovel methods being used to extract the opencast coal. Using thissystem, 37 Mt of the opencast and 62 Mt of the underground resource couldbe recovered to supply a total of 99 Mt of saleable coal with an ashcontent of 16%. A comparison of risk factors suggests that the risksof output shortfall and production cost overruns are lower at Mokau thanat mines in the Waikato Coal Region, though establishment costs couldbe higher. An environmental constraints assessment was integrated withthe mining study to ensure that mining methods took due regard of theenvironmentally sensitive nature of the region. Although environmentalconstraints were identified, the proposed mining strategy allowed forthese and it appears probable that satisfactory results could be achievedwithout imposing additional major costs on the project.</TEXT></DOC>
