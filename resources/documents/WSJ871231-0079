The Justice Department and the Consumer Product Safety Commission approved the agreement, which was filed in federal court here. But the compact sparked bitter criticism, suggesting that it won't put to rest the controversy over the accident-plagued vehicles.    Officials from the Justice Department and commission painted the agreement as the best consumer protection that could be obtained quickly without protracted litigation. But a host of critics attacked the agreement for failing to force the industry to pay refunds for returned models, or to bar use of the vehicles by youngsters.    &quot;This does nothing to reduce the hazard to present owners,&quot; said David Pittle, a former commission member who is technical director for Consumer Reports magazine. Richard Narkewicz, president of the American Academy of Pediatrics, said the accord fails to protect children, who he said tend to be unable to operate the machines safely. &quot;We need to be much more aggressive in addressing the problem,&quot; he said.    The accord also drew sharp criticism from Capitol Hill. Rep. Doug Barnard (D., Ga.) called the agreement &quot;woefully inadequate,&quot; and pledged that his consumer affairs subcommittee would continue investigating the issue. Rep. James Florio (D., N.J.) termed it &quot;a sellout,&quot; and Sen. Alfonse D'Amato (D., N.Y.) said it was &quot;a disaster&quot; for U.S. consumers; they pledged to push for their bills requiring refunds for ATVs purchased for children under 16 years of age.    Even the Consumer Product Safety Commission split, 2-1, over the agreement, with commissioner Anne Graham dissenting and calling for stronger action.    But Deputy Attorney General Arnold Burns called the agreement &quot;the best possible resolution of the problem achievable under current law.&quot; He said the government sought a refund program but dropped the idea after the industry threatened to wage a relentless fight. He said the agreement would &quot;provide a remedy as quickly as we could to stop these deaths, to stop these injuries.&quot;    Most injuries involving all-terrain vehicles have occurred when they flipped over, often landing on their riders. Since 1982, more than 900 persons have died and more than 3,000 have been severely injured in all-terrain vehicle-related accidents in the U.S., according to the consumer product commission. More than a third of those killed were under 16 years old.    The agreement would require manufacturers to buy back existing stocks of three-wheelers in the U.S. For other all-terrain vehicles, the agreement would require free &quot;hands-on&quot; training for all new buyers and anyone who bought a vehicle in the past year. It also calls for marketing and sales practices to try to limit the size of vehicles bought for children under 16. And it mandates warnings about hazards in advertisements, signs, handouts, a toll-free telephone hot line and a form that customers would be required to sign.    Joining in the agreement were Honda Motor Co., Yamaha Motor Co., Suzuki Motors Co., and Kawasaki Heavy Industries Ltd., all of Japan, and their U.S. distributors, as well as Polaris Industries of Minneapolis, a small U.S. all-terrain vehicle maker.    American Honda Motor Co., the biggest U.S. distributor, denied the lawsuit's claims that its vehicles pose an imminent and unreasonable risk to consumers, yet said the settlement &quot;is in everybody's best interest.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
