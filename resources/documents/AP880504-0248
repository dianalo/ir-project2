Radio Corporacion was closed for 24 hours while Radio Mundialand Radio Catolica were barred from regular news programming foreight days. The government said they had been broadcasting ``falsenews'' related to a strike.   The actions came on the ninth day of a hunger strike by about 30construction workers and auto mechanics who are demanding higherpay. Union officials said 4,500 workers remained off the jobWednesday, more than two months after their strike began.   Lorena Obando, a member of the Social Democratic Party, saidpolice in military and civilian vehicles picked up 25 members of 14opposition political parties, ranging from the rightist SocialChristians to the Communists.   They had gathered at the Social Democrats' office and werepreparing to leave for the General Workers Federation buildingabout a mile away, where the hunger strikers were holed up. Theopposition leaders had planned to hold a rally at about noon, butit did not take place.   An Interior Ministry spokeswoman, Alma Morales, later said thegroup ``was invited'' to meet with Cmdr. Doris Tijerino, head ofthe Sandinista police, and taken by bus to meet the commander. Shedid not elaborate.   Police also detained two opposition leaders _ Augustin JarquinAnaya and Armando Guadamuz, both of the Social Christian Party _ asthey arrived at the Workers Federation headquarters.   ``This is the repressive customs of the (Sandinista) Front,''Guadamuz said before the police led him away. ``They are violent bytradition.''   More than 40 people have been taken into police custody inconnection with the hunger strike since it began April 25.   Police cordoned off the front of the Workers Federation buildingand officers ringed the area. Reinforcements waited in militarytrucks.   The protesting workers stood behind locked gates.   At one point, the police pushed several journalists and demandedthey move to another area.   Under an Interior Ministry order issued late Tuesday, RadioCorporacion was shut down immediately and Radio Mundial and RadioCatolica, a Roman Catholic radio station, had their news broadcastsrestricted.   Jose Castillo Osejo, director of Radio Corporacion, was punchedin the mouth by Interior Minister Tomas Borge last week because thestation broadcast what Borge said was incorrect information aboutthe fast, according to Barricada, the official Sandinista newspaper.   Radio Catolica had been shut down for almost two years forfailing to broadcast the president's end-of-year message in 1985.   The only opposition newspaper, La Prensa, was shuttered on June26, 1986, for 15 months.   Press restrictions were common under a state of emergencyenacted by the government in March 1982, four months after the warbegan with the U.S.-backed rebels known as Contras.   President Daniel Ortega lifted those restrictions in January tocomply with a regional peace plan signed in August by five CentralAmerican presidents.   The Workers Federation, a coalition of socialist unions, said4,500 construction workers and car mechanics went on strike Feb. 25to demand higher salaries and better working conditions.   Borge has said only 400 workers are on strike.   The interior minister, during an interview late Tuesday, saidthe strike was ``political and exaggerated.'' He defended thepolice actions, saying: ``Our police are absolutelyanti-repression. They never are abusive, or use torture or murder.''</TEXT></DOC>
