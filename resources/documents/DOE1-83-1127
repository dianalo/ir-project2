Theavailable legal instruments are not to blame if no clear answer can begiven: What is to blame is the still undecided question of the causationof forest decline. It is in part responsible for the controversial judgementof whether possible protective measures provide adequate remedy and aretaken at the appropiate time. To this are added - maybe as a factor ofeven greater weight - national particularities of an economic, technical,or general environment - political nature, for which to find a commondenominator is a difficult task. So the fate of the forests will in thelast resort be decided by the extent to which foreign environmental policyobeys the requirements of internal policy. (orig./HP)</TEXT></DOC>
