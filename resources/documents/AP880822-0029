The statement released late Sunday said U.S. officials whoreportedly accused the Panamanian government of deliberatelysanctioning attacks on Americans ``must have the IQ of a 3-year-oldCro-Magnon.''   U.S. officials in the Panamanian capital said Sunday that U.S.personnel have reported at least 240 incidents of harassment byPanamanian authorities this year, including attempts to extortbribes for traffic violations and the stoppage of mail.   ``PDF (Panama Defense Forces) members have been notably lesscourteous in dealing with our people,'' said an official at theU.S. Southern Command who spoke on condition of anonymity.   U.S. sanctions aimed at ousting Noriega, who has been indictedby two federal grand juries in Florida on drug trafficking charges,were applied in March and have damaged Panama's economy.   Panama's Defense Forces said the harassment reports sought ``todestabilize Panama and immerse it in chaos, an indispensible stepfor not fulfilling and to annul the Panama Canal Treaties, andparticularly to prolong the U.S. military presence beyond the year2000,'' when the United States has agreed to turn the canal over toPanama.   Cynthia Farrell, a spokeswoman for the U.S. embassy in PanamaCity, said Sunday that the reports of harassment are coming fromU.S. military personnel.   ``Civilians, business people and embassy personnel have reportedno increase in harassment,'' she said.   She said she was not sure whether U.S. military personnel arebeing bothered more or are ``simply reporting more cases.''   The latest incident occurred when Panamanian officials blockedU.S. trucks from picking up mail at Torrijos International Airportfor three days last week, a second Southern Command official said.   The official, also speaking on condition of anonymity, said thedispute was satisfactorily settled. A Panamanian official calledthe dispute a ``bureaucratic misunderstanding.''   The U.S. official said 240 cases of harassment were reportedfrom February to August: ``What's going on these days has beengoing on for months _ going way back to last year.   ``One of the things that's happening is that a lot of people arebeing asked for bribes when they're stopped for traffic violations,and that's probably because the police aren't getting paidregularly,'' the official said. ``But if a case like that isreported, it goes down as harassment.''   The New York Times on Sunday quoted Southern Command, State andDefense Department officials as saying there have recently been anincreasing number of beatings, abductions, rape and extortion ofU.S. military personnel and their dependents.   The story, under a Washington dateline, said the U.S. officialsview the incidents as a campaign by the Noriega regime to pressurethe United States to lift economic sanctions against Panama.   However, Southern Command officials disagreed with the reportedmotive and one official said the increased harassment ``could bejust an indication of individual frustration and anger.''   The Panama Defense Forces statement said, ``The supposed U.S.government officials (cited by the Times) must have the IQ of athree-year-old Cro-Magnon when they assert that actions taken bythe Panama Defense Forces against U.S. military personnel areattempts to force the Reagan administration to lift or softeneconomic sanctions imposed on Panama.''   The statement said U.S. troops cause daily problems forPanamanian authorities, including fights, mistreatment of women,venereal disease, shooting in public places and refusing to pay barand restaurant tabs.   U.S. sanctions were applied after Noriega ousted President EricArturo Delvalle. Delvalle has since been in hiding, but the UnitedStates continues to recognize him as Panama's legitimate president.   About 12,000 U.S. servicemen are stationed in Panama by treatyto protect the Panama Canal, a vital waterway linking the Atlanticand Pacific oceans. They are attached to the Southern Command,which is in charge of all U.S. military operations south of theU.S.-Mexico border.</TEXT></DOC>
