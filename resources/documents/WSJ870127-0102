His initial response: Stick to golf.    Although Mr. Nicklaus seems to have overcome his business problems, many athletes don't. Athletes such as football's Harvey Martin (a failed nightclub and restaurants) and baseball's Manny Sanguillen (a failed sporting goods store) have filed for bankruptcy.    Other stars, such as halfback Tony Dorsett (investments in oil and gas and tax shelters) and third baseman Brooks Robinson (failed restaurant and sporting goods store) had serious trouble before recouping. And there is a long list of athletes who will retire with much smaller nest eggs than their salaries could have provided.    &quot;Sports champions think they know everything,&quot; says Mark McCormack, a leading agent. &quot;If they can win a golf tournament, (they think) they can run a car dealership. In fact, they can't.&quot;    To be sure, some athletes have prospered in business. Gino Marchetti, a former Baltimore Colt, built up the Gino's fast-food chain and took it public before it was bought by Marriott Corp. Max McGee, an ex-Green Bay Packer, was a founder of Chi Chi's Inc., a chain of Mexican restaurants, and he helped take it public. Other former athletes built comfortable nest eggs from less pay than today's pros receive.    But many athletes, being novices at handling money, run into problems. Opening a hometown restaurant is a popular investment, but usually doesn't work out as well as Gino's and Chi Chi's have. Athletes &quot;don't realize that you have to be there 18 hours a day,&quot; says Gil Brandt, director of player personnel for the Dallas Cowboys.    But Mr. Brandt doesn't blame only the players. &quot;A lot of agents have no business background whatsoever,&quot; he says.    Mr. Dorsett lost about half a million dollars on an oil stock. His agent, Witt Stewart, says, &quot;Where I messed up is putting so much into one deal.&quot;    Many agents get hundreds of unsolicited investment ideas. Their most essential job is saying no.    Recently, a Baltimore Oriole player was wined and dined and invited to invest $450,000 in what looked like a sure-fire West Coast bar and restaurant. Ron Shapiro, the player's lawyer, says he discovered &quot;some inconsistencies in the books&quot; and scant coverage against liquor liability suits. Without such a check, he says, &quot;the athlete is an easy mark.&quot;    Larry Cain, a San Francisco agent, says one of his clients, a Seattle Seahawk, recently asked him to help him raise the limit on his credit card. &quot;That's a red flag,&quot; Mr. Cain says. He told the player to pay his bills.    Another problem, at least before the tax overhaul, was that athletes invested for tax breaks instead of economic gain. &quot;There is so much more involved&quot; in investing, says Stephen Zucker, a Chicago agent. He is trying to get a well-known quarterback -- with a zero tax base -- out of an unattractive shelter.    Marvin Demoff, a Los Angeles lawyer who represents football players, says, &quot;Athletes probably need to invest a very substantial majority (of their pay) the same way a person on a fixed income would&quot; -- conservatively, and for the future, because their careers are short. &quot;The No. 1 thing is preservation of capital.&quot;    At least some athletes and their agents are trying to move in this direction. Some agents now decline to handle an athlete's investment affairs, turning them over to money managers or financial advisers instead. For example, Mr. Stewart still negotiates Mr. Dorsett's contracts, but the player's investments are now handled by the accounting firm of Peat, Marwick, Mitchell andamp; Co.    Still, few athletes follow a conservative strategy, Mr. Demoff says. &quot;Peer pressure makes it difficult,&quot; he says. &quot;They're as competitive off the field (in money matters) as they are on the field.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
