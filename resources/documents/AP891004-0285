Appearing before House and Senate subcommittees looking intoleveraged buyouts and foreign ownership in the airline industry,Skinner said his decision to restrict the buyout of NorthwestAirlines by Wings Holdings Inc. _ in which KLM Royal Dutch Airlineshas a major investment _ was based on existing law.   He defended the influx of foreign capital and the use of buyoutsto ``recapitalize'' a company when the value of assets _ such asairplanes and various rights _ exceeds the value of company shares.   ``But when they turn to highly leveraged, that's bad,'' he said.   In a leveraged buyout, the new owners pay for the company byborrowing against its assets. To pay off the debt, they often haveto break up the company and sell off parts of it.   Skinner said that in highly leveraged buyouts, the debt servicecan detract from important investments in safety and an up-to-datefleet.   Two aviation subcommittees are discussing proposed legislationthat would make it more difficult for airlines to be acquiredthrough leveraged buyouts. The Senate version addresses foreigninvestments as well.   Skinner, although officially undecided on either House or Senateproposal, said he felt that the law already gives the departmentauthority to act when it questions the fitness of the airline tooperate as a result of a takeover.   Although the Northwest case ``would procedurally have beencleaner'' had it been done earlier with specific guidelines, toomany laws on the books make it easier for lawyers and entrepreneursto find loopholes, he said.   ``It's more difficult to unwind a transaction that has alreadybeen put together than it is to be there from the beginning,''Skinner said, but he added that ``it is not our intention'' toreintroduce regulation.   He disagreed with a specific proposal in the House bill thatwould allow no buyout that raised the debt-equity ratio beyond 1:1in takeovers, saying the ratio had to be examined individually ineach instance. That ratio doesn't exist with airlines in operation.   Foreign ownership of airlines is limited under the FederalAviation Act. Although the provisions of the KLM-Northwestern dealdid not meet the literal guidelines, Skinner said it was clear thatforeign control was an issue.   On Friday, the department announced that the new partners in thedeal would cut KLM's interest from 57 percent to 25 percent. KLMwould keep a seat on the 12-member board but would have to excuseitself from decisions involving competition. Also, the partnersagreed to eliminate a three-member advisory committee that KLMwould have controlled.   The $705 million leveraged buyout, announced in June, is thelargest in the airline industry, Skinner said, and proposed afourfold increase in the company's long-term debt.   The foreign ownership provision is to protect the ability ofcivilian airlines to function in wartime emergencies, such as thetransport of troops. ``It is important if not imperative,'' thatthe foreign ownership rule be enforced because of thatconsideration, he said.   Skinner said he was particularly concerned about the idea ofhaving a KLM board member on the Northwest board when the twoairlines would be technically in competition.</TEXT></DOC>
