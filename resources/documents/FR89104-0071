Background </ITAG>In the <T4>Federal Register </T4>of September 10, 1982 (47 FR 39816), FDA publisheda final rule under section 513 of the Federal Food, Drug, and CosmeticAct (the act) (21 U.S.C. 360c), classifying the generic type of device,the breathing (ventilatory) frequency monitor (21 CFR 868.2375), into classII (performance standards). This device is intended to measure or monitora patient's respiratory rate. The device may provide an audible or visiblealarm when the respiratory rate is outside predetermined limits. The genericdevice encompasses breathing frequency monitors intended for use in a hospitalor in the home and intended for use on adults or infants (neonates_childrenof less than 2 years of age). In the <T4>Federal Register </T4>of July 8, 1983 (48 FR 31392), FDA initiateda proceeding to establish for the breathing frequency monitor a performancestandard under section 514 of the act (21 U.S.C. 360d). FDA did not receiveany requests for a change in the classification of the device. In a notice published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>of February 26, 1986 (51 FR 6886), FDA continuedthe proceeding to establish a performance standard for the breathing frequencymonitor, pursuant to section 514(c) of the act and 21 CFR Part 861. Inthe notice of February 26, 1986, FDA invited any interested persons, includingFederal agencies, to submit, on or before April 28, 1986, an existing standardas a proposed performance standard for the device, or to submit an offerto develop such a proposed standard. In that notice, FDA limited its proceedingto those breathing frequency monitors commonly called neonatal apnea monitors,which are intended for use on infants to detect cessation of breathing.If the infant ceases breathing (apnea) while the device is being used,the device should provide an audible or visible alarm. In the <T4>Federal Register </T4>of July 1, 1986 (51 FR 23832), FDA announcedthat, in accordance with the provisions of section 514(e)(3) of the actand 21 CFR 861.32, FDA may, upon application (which may be made beforethe acceptance of the offer), agree to contribute to the accepted offeror'scost in developing a proposed standard if FDA determines that such contributionis likely to result in a more satisfactory standard that would be developedwithout such contribution. Support would be provided through the meansof a Cooperative Agreement Award to nonfederal institutions and individualsand through an interagency agreement to Federal institutions. CooperativeAgreement Awards would be subject to the cost principles set forth in theFederal Acquisition Regulations System. Cooperative agreements are authorizedunder Pub. L. 95-224 and interagency agreements, under the Economy Actof 1932 as amended (31 U.S.C. 1535; formerly 31 U.S.C. 686). Subsequently,FDA allocated approximately $250,000 to contribute to the offeror's costfor the first year of effort in developing a proposed standard.In the <T4>Federal Register </T4>of April 22, 1988 (53 FR 13296), FDA advisedthat a Notice of Grant Award (cooperative agreement) had been issued tothe Emergency Care Research Institute (ECRI), 5200 Butler Pike, PlymouthMeeting, PA 19462. Items to be delivered to FDA by ECRI by the end of thefirst year were: (1) A draft performance standard document addressing certainspecified issues; (2) a final report that includes a description of thework performed under the cooperative agreement, additional rationale forits necessity, and feasibility for each of the requirements of the standard,including an assessment of the degree of risk of illness or injury designedto be eliminated or reduced by the proposed standard, and a list of referencesused in the development of the standard; (3) hard copies of the referencesmentioned above; and (4) a mailing list for distribution of the draft proposedstandard to interested persons. The cooperative agreement with ECRI was completed on August 31, 1988, withdelivery of the items listed above. Because certain requirements for theinfant apnea monitor were unable to be addressed in the draft documentdelivered to the agency, FDA is now proceeding to develop a proposed standardfor the infant apnea monitor, using the information developed during thecooperative agreement with ECRI (21 U.S.C. 360d(f)). <ITAG tagnum="84">II. First Draft Proposed Standard for the Infant Apnea Monitor_October1988 </ITAG>FDA is now making available for comment its ``First Draft Proposed Standardfor the Infant Apnea Monitor_October 1988.'' FDA's first draft standardis somewhat different from the document delivered to the agency by ECRI.FDA has revised the draft to reflect the format used in FDA regulations.Further, FDA has expanded a number of the specific requirements recommendedby ECRI, and is suggesting the addition of other requirements. Footnotes are provided throughout the draft document to indicate FDA'scurrent thoughts on specific requirements. Test methods for many of theperformance requirements are under development, and an outline of the agency'scurrent approach is provided for comment. The first draft standard containsboth general and specific requirements, and includes an appendix whichprovides the rationale for including each performance requirement in thestandard. FDA welcomes comments on all areas of the document, but particularlyrequests comments on specific requirements, such as effectiveness, apneaduration, test methods, etc. Accordingly, under 21 CFR 861.30, FDA is providing interested persons anopportunity to participate in the development of the standard by acceptingcomments, and where appropriate, holding public meetings on issues relatingto development of the standard. Therefore, FDA is announcing that it willhold an open public meeting to discuss the draft standard on January 25,1989, from 3 p.m. to 5 p.m., at the Embassy Suites (address above). FDA'spublic meeting will be held in conjunction with the Seventh Annual Conferenceon Apnea of Infancy, January 26 to 28, 1989, Rancho Mirage, CA 92270. Data and information submitted voluntarily to FDA during the public meetingto discuss the draft standard will become part of the administrative recordand will be available to the public under 21 CFR 20.111. After comments,data, and information submitted at the open public meeting are reviewed,FDA will prepare and make available another draft proposed standard. FDAplans to prepare and make available for comment at least one, if not two,revised draft standards for the device before publishing in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>a proposed mandatory standard under 21 U.S.C.360d(g) and 21 CFR 10.40. Interested persons may, at any time, submit to the Dockets Management Branch(address above) written comments on the ``First Draft Proposed Standardfor the Infant Apnea Monitor_October 1988.'' Two copies of any commentsare to be submitted, except that individuals may submit one copy. Commentsare to be identified with the docket number found in brackets in the headingof this document. Received comments may be seen in the Dockets ManagementBranch between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday. <ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: December 28, 1988. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Alan L.
