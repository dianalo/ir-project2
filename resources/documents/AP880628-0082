LABELLE</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>NABLUS, Occupied West Bank (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Israeli soldiers shot andwounded a 12-year-old and another Palestinian teen-ager today, andArabs shut down east Jerusalem to protest the 21st anniversary ofits annexation to Israel.   Israeli troops blocked Palestinians in the occupied territoriesfrom entering Jerusalem after an underground Arab leaflet orderedthe the disputed city to be the target of today's general strike.Arabs shuttered shops and schools in east Jerusalem.   In the West Bank city of Nablus, two Palestinians were shot,both in the left leg, near the central marketplace, officials at AlIttihad Hospital and one of the youths said.   Samer Wawi, 17, said he was surrounded by two Israeli patrolswhen he was shot. ``They didn't speak to me. They only fired atme,'' he told The Associated Press from his hospital bed.   Hospital officials identified the second person wounded as SubhiMunib Saayeh, 12.   The army provided no details, saying it was checking the reports.   Since the uprising began Dec. 8, 211 Palestinians and fourIsraelis have been killed.   In Jerusalem today, heavy police forces patrolled the easternArab sector of the city and guarded the gates of the walled OldCity.   Underground Leaflet No. 20, signed by the Palestine LiberationOrganization and Arab leaders of the uprising, called for marchesand a general strike ``in affirmation of the Arab identity ofJerusalem.''   At least 10 outlawed Palestinian flags were raised on utilitypoles this morning.   The status of Jerusalem is one of the most contentious issues inthe Arab-Israel conflict. Israel captured east Jerusalem fromJordan in the 1967 Middle East war, when it also seized the GazaStrip and the West Bank.   Since then, Israel has declared Jerusalem its capital, but mostforeign countries do not recognize that status and keep theirembassies in Tel Aviv.   Jerusalem has 340,000 Jewish and 135,000 Arabs residents. Thecity is considered holy by Jews, Moslems and Christians.   Members of Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's right-wing HerutParty held a counterdemonstration with the theme ``Jerusalem isOurs.'' About 20 cars formed a caravan and drove through parts ofJerusalem, with Israeli flags flying from the windows.   ``We are going to show the Arabs the only flag allowed in Israelis the Israeli flag and the capital of Israel is Jerusalem,'' saida local Herut leader, Reuven Rivlin.   In the West Bank, cities and towns from Bethlehem south ofJerusalem to Nablus in the north were paralyzed by the strike.   Arabs who wished to reach jobs in Israel outside of Jerusalemwere generally stopped by stone-throwing youths, who told them tostay home in keeping with the daylong strike.   A firebomb was thrown at a bus near Bethlehem carryingPalestinian workers to Israel and one woman was injured, Israelradio said.   Palestinians ranging in age from about 8 to 16 gathered inNablus streets, building road blocks and setting fire to junk piles.   The strike also halted most activity in the Gaza Strip, whereIsraeli troops clamped curfews on two refugee camps afterstone-throwing incidents.   On Monday, Arabs heeded their leaders' call for protests andstoned Israeli vehicles in more than a dozen locations.   A Jewish seminary student was slightly injured in the head by astone, and seven Arabs were arrested, police said.   In the West Bank city of Hebron on Monday, about 200 soldierssurrounded the Al Husseini High School after students stonedIsraeli vehicles. Some troops chased students into the school,firing tear gas and rubber bullets, Arab witnesses said.   Officials at Hebron's Alia Hospital said 25 students weretreated for tear gas or beating injuries. The witnesses said troopsdetained about 50 students. The army confirmed the clash but didnot provide details.</TEXT></DOC>
