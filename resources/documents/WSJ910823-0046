Traders said the end of the Soviet Union crisis dulleddemand for short-term government securities. Earlier in theweek, investors scurried for the safety and security ofshort-term Treasurys, which caused prices of the securitiesto surge and caused yields to plunge. On Tuesday, asinternational tensions seemed to escalate, the spread betweenthe yield on two-year notes and the 30-year bond widened to1.95 percentage points.</LP><TEXT>   But in the aftermath of the failed coup in the SovietUnion, the spread narrowed to 1.83 percentage points duemainly to the rise in short-term yields.   &quot;The front end of the curve has lost some of itsenthusiasm and people are trying to extend out the curve,&quot;said James Kenney, trading manager at Prudential SecuritiesInc.   Prices of long-term bonds were buoyed by news of weaknessin the labor market, but after a week of volatile tradingconditions, dealers said there was very little follow-throughbuying from retail investors yesterday.   Initial claims for state unemployment benefits rose anunexpectedly sharp 22,000 in the latest reporting week.Claims were expected to be up about 4,000.   The bond market's bellwether security, the 8.125% 30-yearTreasury bond, rose 1/8 point, or $1.25 for a bond with a$1,000 face amount. The issue's yield, which moves in theopposite direction of its price, eased to 8.05% from 8.06% onWednesday.   The decline in long-term yields triggered a flood of newcorporate bonds as corporate treasurers rushed to takeadvantage of lower borrowing costs.   More than $1.3 billion of new corporate notes and bondswere sold by a wide variety of companies, several of whichtapped the market for the first time in many years.   Toys &quot;R&quot; Us Inc., for example, offered $200 million of30-year debentures priced to yield 8.75%. It was the toycompany's first public debt offering since 1987. &quot;We thinkthere are very advantageous rates out there,&quot; said TreasurerLouis Lipschitz. &quot;With the long bond {yield} being down as itwas, we thought it was an opportunistic time&quot; to sell bonds.   Late in the session, the Federal Reserve released moneysupply data, which showed continued weakness.   The most widely watched of the monetary aggregates, M2,fell $3 billion in the latest week. It had been expected todecline only $1.8 billion. That decline put M2 at the bottomof the Fed's 2.5% to 6.5% growth target bands. M2 has grownat a 2.5% rate from a fourth quarter 1990 base.   M1 fell $5.3 billion, sharply lower than the $700 millionfall forecast. M3, however, posted a $1.8 billion gain on theweek. It had been expected to drop $700 million.   William Dudley, senior economist at Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co.,says weak money data aren't sufficient to push the FederalReserve to cut interest rates. However, &quot;if the Fed sees weakeconomic numbers,&quot; in addition to the weak money supply data,&quot;they have a green light to ease,&quot; said Mr. Dudley. &quot;They'recertainly poised to ease. We'll definitely see it if the{economic} numbers are weak.&quot;   Today, the Department of Commerce will release the latestreport on durable goods orders, which are expected to show a1.5% gain. In June, orders fell 1.4%.   As well as July durable goods orders, auto makers willrelease of mid-August domestic car sales. Cars are expectedto have sold at a 6.5-million-unit annualized rate, accordingto a Dow Jones Capital Markets Report consensus ofeconomists. That is up from 6.2 million units inearly-August, but remains at weak levels. Those data arereleased throughout the day by major car makers.                                                                                                          Treasury Securities                                                                                                          Treasurys ended mixed again. The price of the benchmark30-year bond ended at a price of 100 24/32 to yield 8.05%compared with 100 20/32 to yield 8.06% on Wednesday.   The latest two-year notes, however, ended slightly lowerat 101 4/32 to yield 6.23% compared with 101 5/32 to yield6.21% on Wednesday. In when-issued trading, the new two-yearto be sold next week ended at 6.265%, up from 6.24% lateWednesday.   The when-issued five-year was quoted at 7.253%, down from7.27% late Wednesday.   Treasury bill rates continued to rise. The discount rateon three-month bills ended at 5.30% for a bond-equivalentyield of 5.44% compared with a rate of 5.29% to yield 5.43%on Wednesday. The discount rate on six-month bills rose to5.31% for a bond-equivalent yield of 5.53% compared with arate of 5.28% to yield 5.49%.   Meanwhile, the Treasury sold $12.58 billion of 52-weekbills at an average rate of 5.36%, which was the lowest ratein five years. Here are details of that sale:                                                                                                          Rates are determined by the difference between thepurchase price and face value. Thus, higher bidding narrowsthe investor's return while lower bidding widens it. Thepercentage rates are calculated on a 360-day year, while thecoupon-equivalent yield is based on a 366-day year.                                                                                                                                                 52-Week Bills                                                                                                        Applications ................          $36,214,365,000 Accepted bids ...............          $12,583,715,000 Accepted at low price .......                      33% Accepted noncompetitively ...             $620,305,000 Average price (Rate) ........           94.580 (5.36%) High price (Rate) ...........           94.591 (5.35%) Low price (Rate) ............           94.570 (5.37%) Coupon equivalent ...........                    5.68% CUSIP number ................                912794YX6                                                                                                          The bills are dated Aug. 29, 1991, and mature Aug. 27,1992.                                                                                                          Corporate andamp; Junk Bonds                                                                                                          Corporate treasurers ventured into the debt marketyesterday, offering more than $1.3 billion of new bonds andnotes.   It was the heaviest day for new issues in at least a week.The coup d'etat by Soviet hard-liners earlier this week keptmany corporate issuers at bay. But declining interest ratesbrought the market back to life.   Among the issuers to tap the market yesterday werecorporations as wide ranging as Toys &quot;R&quot; Us, Mellon FinancialCo., Warner-Lambert Co. and Transco Energy Co.   For Warner-Lambert, the multinational health care andconsumer products concern, its $150 million offering ofseven-year notes was its first public bond offering since1986. The noncallable notes were priced to yield 8%. &quot;Wecouldn't pass on this&quot; because interest rates wereattractive, said a company spokesman.   In the junk bond market, Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc.rose again after the giant publisher said it has reached anagreement to merge with General Cinema Corp., a movie-theaterchain operator. Harcourt bonds, which had been climbing evenbefore the news of the merger accord was formally announced,jumped as much as 13 points yesterday.   Harcourt's 14.75% subordinated pay-in-kind debenturesleapt 13 points to a bid price of 52, or $520 for each $1,000bond. That's above the tender price of $470 for each $1,000bond. Pay-in-kind securities pay interest in the form ofaddition securities.   Some traders suggested investors were bidding up thejunior bonds on the expectation that General Cinema will haveto sweeten its tender offer for some bondholders. Meanwhile,Harcourt's 13% senior notes, maturing in 1997, advanced sevenpoints to a bid price of 98, for a gain of almost 12 pointsso far this week.   The junk bonds of Unisys Corp. rose after the WashingtonPost reported that the struggling computer concern may sellits McLean, Va., defense division to investors. Unisys'10.75% debentures, due in 1995, rose 3 1/2 points to 71 onthe New York Stock Exchange.                                                                                                          Municipal Securities                                                                                                          Most municipal bond prices ended little changed after alackluster session.   Among seasoned issues, the Florida State Board ofEducation's 6.75% of 2021 finished 1/8 point higher at 98 3/4to yield 6.84%.   Thinly-traded Connecticut general obligation bond remainedunchanged as Gov. Lowell Weicker signed the state's budget,which includes a 4.5% personal income tax.   Late yesterday, dealers quoted long-term Connecticutgeneral obligation bonds maturing in 20 years as yieldingabout 6.80%, unchanged on the day.   Prior to the completion of the budget, some dealers hadspeculated that the passage of an income tax might depressdemand for Connecticut munis because the tax pacts beingconsidered would have reduced the punishing 14% top incometax rate on unearned income.   The high tax on unearned income encouraged Connecticutresidents to buy instate munis because out-of-state bondswere subject to the 14% top tax.   The budget bill signed by Gov. Weicker will lower the toptax on unearned income to 4.5%, the same as the topincome-tax rate, starting in 1992.   While the budget signed by Gov. Weicker was along thelines of what market participants had expected, there was noreaction in Connecticut munis.   Late Thursday, underwriters at Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co.reported an unsold balance of about $290 million on anoffering of $602 million California taxable generalobligation bonds sold Wednesday.   The underwriting group led by Goldman didn't sell many ofthe bonds this session, given that the unsold balance wasabout $300 million late Wednesday.   The top yield on the aggressively priced issue was 8.15%for bonds maturing in 2001. The top rate came at a spread ofabout 0.34 percentage point above the rate seen on the U.S.Treasury 10-year note at the time of the sale.   Some munis dealers have speculated that the aggressivepricing has damped investor interest in the offering.   The California taxable muni deal was unusual in that itmarked a return of Salomon Brothers Inc. to the municipalarena. Salomon, which served as a co-manager of the offering,departed the tax-exempt market, where it was a significantforce, in 1987.   The last time Salomon participated in a taxable muni dealwas in 1989.   Because it was a taxable deal, the California offeringcould be marketed to Salomon's customers that typically buycorporate bonds or mortgage securities.   The Salomon role also showed that California, which hassevered some business with Salomon because of the firm'sTreasury-securities scandal, including purchase of Salomoncommercial paper, didn't mind having Salomon being involvedin the underwriting group.                                                                                                          Mortgage andamp; Asset-Backed Securities                                                                                                          Prices of mortgage-backed securities ended higher.   Among actively traded secondary issues, GovernmentNational Mortgage Association 9% securities for Septemberdelivery were up 7/32 at 102 1/32.   The Treasury's 10-year note, the issue most closelytracked by the mortgage market, was up 2/32 at 100 19/32 toyield 7.77%.   The spread of the Ginnie Mae 9% issue's yield above thatof the 10-year note continues to narrow, with the spreadcurrently at 1.06 percentage points, compared with 1.07percentage points Wednesday and 1.11 percentage pointsTuesday.   In other mortgage markets, Federal Home Loan MortgageCorp. Gold 9% securities were up 4/32 at 101 23/32. FederalNational Mortgage Association 9% securities were also up4/32, at 101 15/32.</TEXT></DOC>
