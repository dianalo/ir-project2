Many questioned during the first day of jury selection saidthey'd seen such adult magazines as Playboy, Penthouse and Hustler,but said they didn't subscribe. None acknowledged having taken anart class or attending a fund-raiser for the arts.   The Contemporary Arts Center and its director, Dennis Barrie,were charged in April with pandering obscenity and displaying nudephotos of children. The photographs were from the exhibit ``RobertMapplethorpe: The Perfect Moment.''   The seven-week exhibition of photographs by Mapplethorpe, whodied of AIDS in March 1989, attracted a record crowd of more than80,000 people to the gallery last spring.   About 150 gay-rights and anti-censorship demonstrators protestedthe trial outside the Hamilton County Courthouse from mid-morningthrough the noon hour Monday. They sometimes disrupted traffic, butthere were no arrests.   The charges are both misdemeanors. If conviced, Barrie, 43,faces a possible fine of $1,000 and six months in jail on eachcount. The gallery could be fined $5,000 on each count.   A panel of eight jurors and two alternates will be chosen tohear the trial in Hamilton County Municipal Court. Jury selectionwas expected to continue through Tuesday, with testimony lastinginto next week.   A pool of 50 prospective jurors was assembled Monday, butattorneys got less than halfway through questioning the first groupof eight.   ``Would you avoid a homosexual art display?'' the gallery'sattorney, Marc Mezibov, asked one prospective juror.   ``I wouldn't put out money to see homosexual art,'' the manresponded.   Mezibov also told prospective jurors that testimony will dealwith Mapplethorpe's homosexuality.   Prosecutor Frank Prouty asked prospective jurors whether theyhad seen Playboy, Penthouse or Hustler magazines and whether theyhad taken art classes or attended an arts fund-raiser.   Judge David Albanese asked all 50 prospective jurors if they hadany personal contact with the art community. One person said shewas a member of the Contemporary Arts Center, and three said theyhad seen the exhibit.   Protesters outside denounced the trial as homophobicintimidation.   They chanted, ``Art on trial,'' and carried signs that said,``Stop gay bashing'' and ``Art today, your bedroom tomorrow.''   Demonstrators, accompanied by mounted police, walked 10 blocksthrough downtown, twice passing the gallery. Some people lay in thestreet, briefly halting traffic.   Catherine Adams, a lawyer for Gay-Lesbian March Activists, saidshe told city and county authorities last week that some members ofthe group had AIDS. About 50 officers, some of them wearing rubbergloves, set up barricades and patrolled the area.   A grand jury indicted Barrie and the gallery, concluding thatseven of the 175 Mapplethorpe photos violated community standards.One photo shows a man urinating into another man's mouth. Othersshow oral sex and anal penetration with objects.   Officials of the American Civil Liberties Union and theAssociation of Art Museum Directors have said this is the firstcase they know of an obscenity prosecution of an art museum.   Albanese denied a defense motion to declare a mistrial based onpretrial news reports, particularly use of phrases such as ``childpornography.''   He also denied a motion to limit potential jurors to Cincinnatiresidents. Because of the structure of the Hamilton CountyMunicipal Court, the jury pool is drawn from residents ofCincinnati and its suburbs.   The judge denied a motion to allow individual questioning ofpotential jurors and denied a defense request to increase thenumber of pre-emptory challenges.</TEXT></DOC>
