The rule defines the benefits and eligibility requirements,provides for insurance or prepayment contracting for benefit administrationand payment, provides for Government and Uniformed Services member sharingin the cost of premiums for the insurance or prepayment contract, definesauthorized providers, provides for benefit communications and implementation,establishes alternative delivery systems criteria and requirements, andprovides an appeals procedure. Eligibility for the program is limited toUniformed Services active duty members' dependents residing in the 50 UnitedStates, District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and theU.S. Virgin Islands. Benefits of the program are limited to diagnostic services, oral examinations,scaling deposits from teeth, polishing of teeth, topical application offluoride to teeth, space maintenance, minor palliative emergency services,amalgam and composite restorations, stainless steel crowns for primaryteeth, and dental appliance repairs. Benefits are further limited by thelimitations and exclusions established for these benefits by the Director,OCHAMPUS or designee to assure quality of care and appropriate cost constraints.Authorized providers are dentists and dental hygienists practicing withinthe scope of their licenses.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>EFFECTIVE DATE: </T2>August 1, 1987.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESS: </T2>Office of Civilian Health and Medical Program of theUniformed Services (OCHAMPUS), Office of Program Development, Aurora, CO80045-6900.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2>Joseph C.

Thislimitation was interpreted to include the 50 States, the District of Columbia,the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Two categories of dental benefits are provided: ``(1) Diagnostic, oralexamination, and preventive services and palliative emergency care; and(2) basic restorative services of amalgam and composite restorations andstainless steel crowns for primary teeth, and dental appliance repairs.''<ITAG tagnum="84">Proposed Rule and Comments </ITAG>In FR Doc. 87-12288 appearing in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on May 29, 1987 (52 FR 103), the Office of theSecretary of Defense published for public comment a proposed amendmentregarding the implementation of the Active Duty Dependents Dental Plan.We received comments from government agencies, two national associationsrelated to dental care providers, and a dental insurer. We express ourappreciation to all commenters for their substantive comments. The followingsummarizes the comments, suggestions, and the actions taken. Most commenters felt that the provisions for implementing the two-yearenrollment requirement were unduly restrictive with respect to potentialtermination at the end of an initial enlistment. The two-year enrollmentis consistent with Congressional guidance and is deemed essential by theinsurer for financial long-term viability of the Dependents Dental Plan.Agreement has been reached on retaining the two-year enrollment requirement,but substituting in andSection; 199.13(c)(3) a more general provision thatactive duty members are to enroll with the intent of remaining on activeduty for at least the two-year period, and in andSection; 199.13(c)(5) aprovision that termination from active duty at any time results in terminationof enrollment at the end of the month in which active duty ceases. Thissimplifies the administrative process of enrollment and delegates to theactive duty members and their supervisors the responsibility for assuringcompliance with the intent of two-year enrollment. Uniformed Services commenters requested that an exception provision beincluded, similar to that in CHAMPUS, permitting claims to be processedin the absence of direct verification through DEERS of the dependent'senrolled status. This recommendation was not adopted since, unlike CHAMPUS,the Dependents Dental Plan does not produce a presumption of eligibilitybased on entitlement of dependents as a result of active duty status ofthe Uniformed Service member. Some active duty members voluntarily declineenrollment in the Dependents Dental Plan. Premiums paid to the contractorat the beginning of each month of coverage also require a direct verificationof eligibility with no presumption of eligibility possible as long as theplan includes the opportunity to voluntarily decline enrollment. Consequently,the suggestion could not be adopted because of its legal and technicalinfeasibility. Concern was also expressed by some Uniformed Service commenters with theprovision for continuing coverage until the end of the month in which terminationof enrollment occurs as a result of termination of active duty status.While it is recognized that other benefits terminate upon termination ofactive duty status, the standard practice of whole month premium paymentsin dental insurance and the small amount deducted from the active dutymember's pay each month for partial payment of the premium do not providea cost-effective basis for reimbursement of partial month premium payments.Neither is it reasonable to deny the enrollee the benefit eligibility forthe remaining days of the month in which termination from active duty occurssince the individual and the Government must pay for the full month. Therefore,this suggestion was not adopted. Other comments received concerning eligibility and enrollment were adopted.An implementing instruction includes provisions for disenrollment at theactive duty member's election within 90 days following a permanent changeof duty station where dependent dental care from a military facility isavailable. Disenrollment also may occur where the active duty member providesevidence of coverage under another employment-based private sector dentalplan. And, the member may initiate disenrollment when the member no longerhas eligible dependents or no eligible dependents residing within the jurisdictionof the Dependents Dental Plan. Title 10, U.S.C. 1056(a) prohibits dependentsenrolled in the Dependents' Dental Plan from receiving the services authorizedas benefits from military dental care facilities, except for emergencytreatment and diagnostic services required for delivery of services notcovered by the plan. These provisions have been added in andSection; 199.13(c)(5)(iii)and (iv) of the final rule. One commenter proposed changes with respect to the explanation of coveragefor dental hygienists as authorized providers, suggesting that languageidentifying that dental hygienists are not authorized as independent practitionersexcept in a small number of states should be deleted as redundant to thestatement that dental hygienists are authorized providers only within thescope of their licenses. A purpose of the rule is to clearly communicateto the Dependents' Dental Plan beneficiaries who is authorized to providewhat benefits. After careful review, we believe that a modified versionof this statement is essential to beneficiary understanding of the limitationson the availability of services by dental hygienists in independent practice.A commenter identified that about fourteen percent of currently licenseddental hygienists are qualified by a certificate in dental hygiene thatis accepted by accrediting and licensing bodies as comparable to the associatedegree. The language of andSection; 199.13(b) has been changed to includethese dental hygienists within the terms of those provisions. A commenter suggested that andSection; 199.13(f)(1) be clarified to assurethat services of dental lab technicians were covered. This suggestion wasnot adopted since these services are rendered under varying licensure andcertification requirements. The extent of coverage must be determined bythe contractor where the services are ordered by the dentist in connectionwith other primary covered services under the Dependents Dental Plan. Two commenters recommended that dental sealants be included within thedefinition of preventive services covered by the Dependents' Dental Plan.The commenters suggest that the initial cost of these services would resultin program savings over the long term as well as in savings to beneficiarieswho would not incur more extensive, uncovered restorative services in futureyears. The short-term costs of dental sealants were not included in thebenefit design or funding request, and cannot be added at this time. However,we will study the feasibility and long-term cost effectiveness of addingthis benefit, and report recommendations in July, 1988. Several commenters expressed concern that the limitations on coverage ofdiagnostic tests were not clearly communicated in the benefits section.In andSection; 199.13(e)(2)(A) (2) and (3), commenters felt there was a needto be more explicit with respect to which radiologic and laboratory serviceswere covered. Diagnostic services are covered when they are necessary andappropriate to the dental condition and to the necessary and appropriateperformance of covered preventive and restorative services. In addition,some procedures such as an arthrogram (00320) would never be covered becausethe procedures are performed only in the management and treatment of non-coveredconditions. We agree that clarification is required. Further investigation has identifiedseveral infrequently used procedures that are not covered by the Dependents'Dental Plan because they are employed only in the management and treatmentof non-covered conditions. Consequently, it is not appropriate for themto be covered by the Dependents' Dental Plan. These procedures have beenlisted in andSection; 199.13(e)(2)(i) and (iii)(A) of the final rule as exclusions.Reference to these procedures in the dental benefits brochure issued bythe contractor is in conflict with this clarification and will be correctedin the next annual issuance of the brochure. It is not possible to identifyin the final rule the large number of combinations of circumstances andconditions in which other diagnostic procedures would be covered and notcovered. Instead, we have clarified the general provisions of andSection;199.13(e), and will reply on the expertise of the Plan's insurer to makethe detailed adjudication decisions in compliance with the general provision.One commenter noted that the proposed rule did not include the provisionof law which excludes availability to enrolled beneficiaries of militarydental care for benefits covered by the Plan. A provision has been addedin andSection; 199.13(e)(2)(vii) to correct this oversight.A commenter recommended that subsections andSection; 199.13(f)(6)(i) and(ii) be changed to provide the same level of reimbursement to participatingand non-participating providers. The commenter argued that some state insuranceregulations prohibit <T3>private</T3> programs from making a distinction in level of reimbursementbetween participating and non-participating providers, and that publicationof a list of participating dentists is an adequate incentive to encourageparticipation. We have reviewed this provision and determined that thereimbursement distinction is frequently used by dental insurers and resultsin increased numbers of participating providers. The state insurance regulationsprohibiting such distinctions include only a few states and do not includea prohibition of such distinctions for public programs. We believe thatthe distinction provides a small but highly visible and necessary incentivefor participation and have accordingly made no change in this provision.A commenter recommended elimination of the provision for exclusive providerarrangements in order to assure that beneficiaries receive the same opportunitiesto receive treatment from dentists of their choice as employed by the publicat large. While this is the present practice of the Dependents Dental Plan,it has been determined that this provision should be retained in orderto provide a potential, future alternative form of contracting for benefitsin the event that beneficiaries and the government should encounter adversepricing or participation practices by most providers in given localities.In addition, this provision is considered necessary in assuring a widerange of competition in future solicitation of the Plan.Other comments received offered minor technical and editorial changes whichwere duly considered. Based on one technical comment, andSection; 199.13(a)(7) and (e)(1)(iii) have been revised since records by contract areretained by the insurer as business records, subject to inspection by thegovernment and transfer to another insurer in the event of a change incontractor. Enrollment records are government-furnished property and aremaintained by the insurer. The government receives management reports anddoes not maintain a system of records for the Dependents' Dental Plan.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 32 CFR Part 199</ITAG>Dental insurance, Claims, Handicapped, Health insurance, Military personnel.<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 199_[AMENDED]</ITAG>Accordingly, 32 CFR Part 199 is amended as follows:1.

For additional implementing authority see andSection; 199.1 (c)of this part.(B) <T3>Evidence of eligibility. </T3>The Department of Defense, through thedefense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System (DEERS), is responsiblefor establishing and maintaining a listing of persons eligible to receivebenefits under the Active Duty Dependents Dental Plan.(4) <T3>Active duty dependents dental benefit plan. </T3>This is a programof dental benefits provided by the U.S. Government under public law tospecified categories of individuals who are qualified for these benefitsby virtue of their relationship to one of the seven Uniformed Services,and their voluntary decision to accept enrollment in the program and costshare with the Government in the premium cost of the benefits. The DependentsDental Plan is an insurance, service, or prepayment plan involving a contractguaranteeing the indemnification or payment of the enrolled member's dependentsagainst a specified loss in return for a premium paid. Where state regulations,charter requirements, or other provisions of state and local regulationgoverning dental insurance and prepayment programs conflict with Federallaw and regulation governing this Program, Federal law and regualtion shallgovern. Otherwise, this Program shall comply with state and local regulatoryrequirements.(5) <T3>Plan funds_</T3>(i) <T3>Funding sources. </T3>The funds used by the Active Duty DependentsDental Plan are appropriated funds furnished by the Congress through theannual appropriation acts for the Department of Defense and the Departmentof Health and Human Services and funds collected by the Uniformed Servicesmonthly through payroll deductions as premium shares from enrolled members.(ii) <T3>Disposition of funds. </T3>Plan funds are paid by the Government aspremiums to an insurer, service, or prepaid dental care organization undera contract negotiated by the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, under theprovisions of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR).(iii) <T3>Plan. </T3>The Director, OCHAMPUS or designee provides an insurancepolicy, service plan, or prepaid contract of benefits in accordance withthose prescribed by law and regulation; as interpreted and adjudicatedin accord with the policy, service plan, or contract and a dental benefitsbrochure; and as prescribed by requirements of the dental plan organization'scontract with the government.(iv) <T3>Contracting out. </T3>The method of delivery of the Active Duty DependentsDental Benefit Plan is through a competitively procured contract.

The HBA may assist beneficiaries or sponsorsin applying for benefits, in the preparation of claims, and in their relationswith OCHAMPUS and the dental plan insurer. However, the HBA is not responsiblefor the plan's policies and procedures and has no authority to make benefitdeterminations or obligate the plan's funds. Advice given to beneficiariesas to determination of benefits or level of payment is not binding on OCHAMPUSor the insurer.(7) <T3>Disclosure of information to the public. </T3>Records and informationacquired in the administration of the Active Duty Dependents Dental Planare not records of the Department of Defense. The records are establishedby the Dependents Dental Plan insurer in accordance with standard businesspractices of the industry, and are used in the determination of eligibility,program management and operations, utilization review, quality assurance,program integrity, and underwriting in accordance with standard businesspractices.

An appeal cannot challenge the propriety, equity,or legality of any provision of law and regulation.(i) <T3>Initial determination_</T3>(A) <T3>Notice of initial determination and right to appeal. (1) </T3>The dentalplan contractor shall mail notices of initial determinations to the ActiveDuty Dependents Dental Plan beneficiary at the last known address. Forbeneficiaries who are under 18 years of age or who are incompetent, a noticeissued to the parent or guardian constitutes notice to the beneficiary.(<T3>2</T3>) The dental plan contractor shall notify providers of an initialdetermination on a claim only if the providers participated in the claimor accepted assignment.(<T3>3</T3>) Notice of an initial determination on a claim by the dentalplan contractor shall be made in the contractor's explanation of benefits(beneficiary) or with the summary of payment (provider).(<T3>4</T3>) Each notice of an initial determination on a request for benefitauthorization, a request by a provider for approval as an authorized provider,or a decision to disqualify or exclude a provider, or a decision to disqualifyor exclude a provider as an authorized provider under the Active Duty DependentsDental Plan shall state the reason for the determination and the underlyingfacts supporting the determination.(<T3>5</T3>) In any case when the initial determination is adverse to thebeneficiary or participating provider or to the provider seeking approvalas an authorized provider, the notice shall include a statement of thebeneficiary's or provider's right to appeal the determination.

Participation in an appeal is limitedto any party to the initial determination, including OCHAMPUS, the dentalplan contractor, and authorized representatives of the parties. Any partyto the initial determination, except OCHAMPUS and the dental plan contractor,may appeal an adverse determination. The appealing party is the party whoactually files the appeal.(A) <T3>Parties to the initial determination</T3>. For purposes of these appealand hearing procedures, the following are not parties to an initial determinationand are not entitled to administrative review under this section.(<T3>1</T3>) A provider disqualified or excluded as an authorized providerunder the Active Duty Dependents Dental Plan based on a determination underanother Federal or federally funded program is not a party to the OCHAMPUSaction and may not appeal under this section(<T3>2</T3>) A sponsor or parent of a beneficiary under 18 years of ageor guardian of an incompetent beneficiary is not a party to the initialdetermination and may not serve as the appealing party, although such personsmay represent the appealing party in an appeal.(<T3>3</T3>) A third party other than the dental plan contractor, such asan insurance company, is not a party to the initial determination and isnot entitled to appeal, even though it may have an indirect interest inthe initial determination.(<T3>4</T3>) A nonparticipating provider is not a party to the initial determinationand may not appeal.(B) <T3>Representative</T3>. Any party to the initial determination may appointa representative to act on behalf of the party in connection with an appeal.Generally, the parent of a minor beneficiary and the legally appointedguardian of an incompetent beneficiary shall be presumed to have been appointedrepresentative without specific designation by the beneficiary.(<T3>1</T3>) The representative shall have the same authority as the partyto the appeal, and notice given to the representative shall constitutenotice required to be given to the party under this part.(<T3>2</T3>) To avoid possible conflicts of interest, an officer or employeeof the United States, such as an employee or member of a Uniformed Service,including an employee or staff member of a Uniformed Service legal office,or a OCHAMPUS advisor, subject to the exceptions in 18 U.S.C. 205, is noteligible to serve as a representative. An exception usually is made foran employee or member of a Uniformed Service who represents an immediatefamily member. In addition, the Director, OCHAMPUS, or designee, may appointan officer or employee of the United States as the OCHAMPUS representativeat a hearing.(iii) <T3>Burden of proof</T3>. The burden of proof is on the appealing partyto establish affirmatively by substantial evidence the appealing party'sentitlement under law and this part to the authorization of the ActiveDuty Dependents Dental Plan benefits or approval as an authorized provider.Any cost or fee associated with the production or submission of informationin support of an appeal may not be paid by OCHAMPUS.(iv) <T3>Late filing</T3>. If a request for reconsideration, formal review,or hearing is filed after the time permitted in this section, written noticeshall be issued denying the request. Late filing may be permitted onlyif the appealing party reasonably can demonstrate to the satisfaction ofthe dental plan contractor, or the Director, OCHAMPUS, or designee, thattimely filing of the request was not feasible due to extraordinary circumstancesover which the appealing party had no practical control. Each request foran exception to the filing requirement will be considered on its own merits.(v) <T3>Appealable issue</T3>.

Such issues include but are notlimited to the following examples:(<T3>1</T3>) Determination of a person's eligibility as an enrolled beneficiaryin the Active Duty Dependents Dental Plan is the responsibility of theappropriate Uniformed Service. Although OCHAMPUS and the dental plan contractormust make determinations concerning a beneficiary's enrollment, ultimateresponsibility for resolving a beneficiary's eligibility and enrollmentrests with the Uniformed Services. Accordingly, a disputed question offact concerning a beneficiary's enrollment or eligibility will not be consideredan appealable issue under the provisions of this section, but shall beresolved in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section.(<T3>2</T3>) The decision to disqualify or exclude a provider because ofa determination against that provider under another Federal or federallyfunded program is not an initial determination that is appealable underthis part. The provider is limited to exhausting administrative appealrights offered under the Federal or federally funded program that madethe initial determination. However, a determination to disqualify or excludea provider because of abuse or fraudulent practices or procedures underthe Active Duty Dependents Dental Plan is an initial determination thatis appealable under this part.(vi) <T3>Amount in dispute</T3>. An amount in dispute is required for an adversedetermination to be appealed under the provisions of this section, exceptas set forth in the following:(A) The amount in dispute is calculated as the amount of money the dentalplan contractor would pay if the services and supplies involved in disputewere determined to be authorized benefits of the Active Duty DependentsDental Plan. Examples of amounts of money that are excluded by this partfrom payments for authorized benefits include, but are not limited to:(<T3>1</T3>) Amounts in excess of the dental plan contractor-determinedallowable charge.(<T3>2</T3>) The beneficiary's cost-share amounts for restorative services.(<T3>3</T3>) Amounts that the beneficiary, or parent, guardian, or otherresponsible person has no legal obligation to pay.(B) There is no requirement for an amount in dispute when the appealableissue involves a denial of a provider's request for approval as an authorizedprovider or the determination to disqualify or exclude a provider as anauthorized provider.(C) Individual claims may be combined to meet the required amount in disputeif all of the following exist:(<T3>1</T3>) The claims involve the same beneficiary.(<T3>2</T3>) The claims involve the same issue.(<T3>3</T3>) At least one of the claims so combined has had a reconsiderationdecision issued by the dental plan contractor.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Note: </T4>A request for administrative review under this appeal processwhich involves a dispute regarding a requirement of law or regulation (paragraph(h)(1)(v)(A) of this section) or does not involve a sufficient amount indispute (paragraph (h)(1)(vi) of this section) may not be rejected at thereconsideration level of appeal.
