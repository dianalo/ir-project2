When the United States and the Soviet Union were negotiating thetreaty, there was some opposition from officials in Bonn worried itwould leave the Soviets with a military advantage.   Kohl erased doubts about West German support on Thursday when hewent to Capitol Hill and lobbied for speedy Senate ratification ofthe pact, which would eliminate missiles with ranges between 300and 3,000 miles.   ``He put his wholehearted support behind the INF treaty,indubitably, unquestionably and without any reservation, sayingthat there should be no amendments to it,'' Senate Majority LeaderRobert Byrd, D-W.Va., said after the private meeting.   Kohl's spokesman, Friedhelm Ost, confirmed Byrd's account andsaid the chancellor told Congress the treaty is necessary tomaintain momentum in the drive for disarmament.   Kohl was due to meet with President Reagan today with bothmilitary and money matters on the agenda.   Among those Kohl saw on Thursday was Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C.,who has argued against the treaty on grounds it will hurt Europeansecurity. Helms did not relent in his opposition to the pact, butsaid of Kohl, ``he's the most impressive head of state that we'vehad in a long time. He gives detailed answers to every question.''   West Germany is intensely active in efforts to shape U.S. armscontrol strategy because its location on the frontier with Sovietbloc nations gives it special interests and special fears aboutmilitary arrangements on both sides.   Kohl was the last Western European leader to see Secretary ofState George P. Shultz before the secretary's departure today forMoscow and more arms control negotiations with the Soviets.   Highest on Shultz's arms control agenda is a U.S.-Soviet effortto reach an agreement by a late spring summit in Moscow to cutarsenals of intercontinental ballistic missiles and other strategicnuclear arms by 50 percent.   NATO has agreed the strategic arms talks are the first priority.But West German politicians, particularly the opposition SocialDemocrats, have sought more of an emphasis in negotiations onreducing short-range systems _ the type of weapons that could beused on German soil if a conventional war broke out and escalatedquickly.   Officials in Bonn also have been questioning how quickly NATOshould implement a 1983 decision to modernize its force ofshort-range nuclear weapons _ those with ranges below 300 miles.   The Germans are particularly concerned about deployment of a newgeneration of ground-launched rockets to replace NATO's aged forceof 75-mile-range Lance missiles with rockets capable of hittingtargets more than 100 miles away.   A senior administration official, speaking on condition ofanonymity, issued assurances that though the modernization willproceed, there is no rush.   Deployment of missiles to replace the Lance may not occur before1995, the official said.   ``There are no major decisions facing the alliance and sothere's not an issue here in the day-to-day working of thealliance,'' the official said.   Much more study of the weaponry that would replace the Lancemissile is required by the Defense Department before the newweapons are produced, the official said.   The view was echoed by Wim van Eekelen, the Netherlands' defenseminister and chairman of the Eurogroup _ the European members ofthe NATO alliance.   Van Eekelen, whose visit to Washington coincided with Kohl'strip, said at a news conference that NATO should adhere to itsagreement on modernizing short-range missiles, while delaying afinal decision to deploy until the weapons are produced.</TEXT></DOC>
