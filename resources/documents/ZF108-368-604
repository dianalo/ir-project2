VAX 8250s, 8350s and 8530s running under VMS.ATImost likely will move to VAX 6000s.andM;The forms-based indexing subsystem provides data security, protocolconversion and telecommunications gateways, Romano said.andP;  Each site can setup its own security profile tailored to its needs.andM;The storage subsystem uses the Xerox/Sun workstations running under UNIX asnetwork servers, and Eastman Kodak Co. 14-inch jukeboxes capable of storing685 gigabytes of data each, Romano said.andP;  The capability to add 5-1/4-inchjukeboxes exists, but is not part of current plans.andM;The contract calls for three types of user workstations: one each forgraphics, engineering and video display, Romano said.andP;  The 8M graphicsworkstations already are installed on Zenith Data Systems Z-248s and IndustryStandard Architecture ATs running MS-DOS, Romano said.andP;  The engineeringworkstations are the Xerox/Sun machines or 386 AT-compatible.andM;The ASCII video display terminals are used for on-line index database queriesand print-on-demand requests, Romano said.andP;  The terminals are hooked mostlyby Ethernet and can use TCP/IP and Sun's Network File System.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
