 Moreover, we have seen more than once that information technology(IT) has a special role to play in bringing about major transformations ofsuch industries as airlines, automakers, hospital supply, and banking.andM;Yet the changes we have seen in computers and information systems to date maybe relatively tranquil compared to the transforming potential of IT on thehorizon [12].andP;  ISDN is only one of dozens of promising technologies that havethe potential to revolutionize the way people work and process information.andO;Efficient and effective IT will be crucial for meeting the challenge oforganizational prosperity in the 1990s and early 2000s.andP;  Time frames forplanning will be drastically curtailed, meaning that mistakes in only a fewcritical arenas can result in disastrous consequences for individualorganizations [12].andP;  In short, organizational survival will be even more atstake in the future than it has been in the past because there will not betime to rectify forecasting errors.andP;  Accordingly, there is an urgency to worktoward sensitive forecasts of the direction of all technological development,and of information technology in particular.andM;How do we understand the future and focus our reasoning processes on the factof change?andP;  The approach of governments, organizations, and even individualsto this issue is technology forecasting and technology assessment.andP;   Withforecasts that carefully formulate estimates of how technology will affectsociety as a whole and organizational life, change can be anticipated andthus managed.andM;The present study is a technological forecast of IT that will be dominantforces for organizational change in the 1990s.andP;  It contributes to ourforeknowledge of the turbulent environment of the 1990s by synthesizing theexpertise of 11 internationally known information managementauthorities--persons recognized for their understanding of organizationalinformation needs and how well particular technologies fit these needs.andO;Their responses to a structured list of information technologies indicatethat the role of IT will be critical to the success of many organizations inthe 1990s.andP;  In terms of organizational impact, those information technologiesthat are going to be of greatest significance are technologies that willsubstantially improve the human-machine interface, technologies that greatlyenhance data and person-to-person communications, and technologies thatunderwrite the development and maintenance of information systems.andP;  Severaltechnologies were identified as having limited impact, including stand-aloneexpert systems/artificial intelligence.andP;  Other emerging technologies weresingled out as increasing in significance after the turn of the millennium.andM;Technological Forecasting and AssessmentandM;Technology forecasting and technology assessment may be thought of assub-disciplines within technology management.andP;  Whereas technologicalforecasting creates likely scenarios for the impact of various technologiesat some future time, technological assessment evaluates the effects of thesechanges as they occur or after they have already taken place [14].andO;Technology forecasting and assessment are closely related.andP;  While they sharean interest in the impacts of technology so that one field informs the other,their methods differ.andP;  Technology forecasting relies heavily on forecasters'ability to project into the future, whereas technological assessment reliesmore on rational analysis and evaluation of current and past events.andP;  In thisarticle, we will concentrate on the future role of IT and will therefore drawfrom the methods of technology forecasting.andM;What is technology forecasting and what is its primary objective? First,technology may be broadly defined as designs that reduce uncertainty aboutoutcomes [17] or, alternatively, as &quot;knowledge of physical relationships[that can be] systematically applied to the useful arts&quot; [16].andP;  Accordinglyto these broad definitions, technology is not simply new inventions orproducts, but also systematic techniques, standards, and ideas that improvethe human condition.andP;  Forecasts, moreover, evaluate the likelihood of futuredevelopments and their impact on society or a targeted segment of society.andO;In general, technology forecasts serve the key function of speculating on thefuture value and importance of innovations.andM;Survey and Evaluation of TechnologyandM;Forecasting MethodologiesandM;Over the last several decades, a relatively large set of methodologies forforecasting technologies has been developed.andP;  The following survey of thisextensive literature takes a practical rather than a purely academic point ofview in order to put the approach we have taken in the present study in itsproper context.andM;Methods for technology forecasting methods fall roughly into qualitative andquantitative approaches [15], main subdivisions of which are shown in TableI.andP;  Although the basic set of methodologies has remained relatively constantover the years (cf.andP;  [6, 11]), new approaches, especially new quantitativeapproaches, and variations on present approaches are occasionally introduced[18, 19].andM;As the characteristics of forecasting methods in Table I imply, methodologieshave relative strengths and weaknesses with respect to answering particularquestions about the future [11].andP;  For example, quantitative approaches workbetter under stable conditions in which there is a relationaship between pasthistory and future events, whereas qualitative techniques have an advantagein more turbulent times.andM;The Value of Technology Forecasting forandM;OrganizationsandM;The value of forecasts in the organizational context is that they providecritical input for managerial decision-making [14, 20].andP;  Forecasts andforecasting, in fact, affect virtually every decision managers make [6].andO;More useful for evaluating large and broad effects than precise effects,forecasts give managers a sense for likely opportunities and threats in theorganizational environment [16] and through this foreknowledge give managersthe opportunity to anticipate and cope with unexpected events.andM;The importance of IT forecasting, which focuses on technologies that leveragethe accessing, exchange and interpretation of information, is clearlydemonstrated by a growing recognition of the need for futuristics in thisarea by corporate America [15].andP;  Information technology forecasts areincreasingly essential for the continued well being of organizations [23], somuch so that organizations are now creating high profile IT investigatorydivisions to keep them abreast of technology and innovation.andP;  Until recently,there was little or no role for forecasting among the various functions oftraditional Information Systems (I/S) departments [23].andP;  But traditionalroles for I/S, including system development, operations, and technicalservice, are now evolving into an expanded role that includes technologyforecasting, technology transfer, and associated support services.andP;  By 1989,firms like Air Products, Aetna, Prudential, and IDS, among others werefunding active IT investigatory divisions.andM;METHODOLOGYandM;This study, like other IT forecasts [4], focuses on technologies that willreach the markeplace and assume a dominant position in the 1990s.andP;  It differsfrom approaches that forecast critical technologies from a purely technicalor technological point of view in that it looks at demand-pull as well astechnology-push.andP;  It also differs from alternative approaches in that itviews the introduction of new technologies from an organizational impactperspective.andM;Forecasts that concentrate primarily or completely on the technologiesthemselves are valuable in describing IT that will be mature or advancedenough to be ready for use by a specific future date.andP;  From a pragmatic andbusiness standpoint, however, there is added value in simultaneouslyassessing organizational impact.andP;  Both I/S and general managers need to knowwhich of the high-growth technologies will profoundly affect the way theyconduct their business.andM;The research question for this study, therefore, has been formulated as:andM;&quot;Which information technologies will have the greatest organizational impactduring the 1990s?&quot;andM;Research DesignandM;The research question called for an approach which could assess the fitbetween organizational need and appropriate technologies.andP;  A method thatprovides an evaluation of both the demand and the supply side of this fit isthe qualitative technique of key informant interviews.andP;  This qualitativetechnique is frequently used in academic marketing research to gatherinformed opinion about complex phenomena and is a variation on theforecasting technique of expert panel consensus described by Chambers [6] andthe jury approach outlined by [11], techniques which appear in Table I as&quot;Expert panel or jury.&quot;andM;This qualitative technique is especially suitable because of th euncertaintly that lies ahead in the 1990s [12].andP;  Unstable environmentalfactors produce discontinuities in the spread of new technologies which needto be reflected in IT forecasts of the 1990s.andP;  Unanticipated technologicalbreakthroughs and/or subsequent changes in the demand for technology will, inall likelihood, adversely impact the viability of a technology forecast.andO;This principle was illustrated nicely in the development of the personalcomputer (PC).andP;  Diffusion of the PC was dramatically affected by thedevelopment of spreadsheet software for business applications as the combinedavailability of powerful, low-cost workstations and a pressing organizationalneed addressed by electronic spreadsheets produced an exponential diffusionof both technologies and revolutionized the way information was processed inthe 1980s.andM;Alternative methods of forecasting IT were rejected because these techniqueswould not necessarily have generated qualitative data critical to answeringthe basic research question.andP;  In the past, quantitative techniques have notbeen as adaptable to dynamic environmental conditions that will likelycharacterize the 1990s.andP;  Qualitative techniques were selected instead as moresuitable in this regard.andP;  A Delphi survey of information management experts,for example, would have dealt well with these dynamics and allowed both alonger list of information technologies and a larger sample.andP;  However, whileit would have resulted in a rank ordered set of information technologies interms of impact, it would not have yielded the rich insight and explanationthat was inherent in the key informant interviews.andM;In the present study, key informant interviews not only allowed researchersto gather specific data about the topic of interest from knowledgeablesources but they also permitted respondents a full range of objective andsubjective responses to the basic research question.andM;SOURCE OF INFORMED OPINIONandM;FOR TECHNOLOGY FORECASTINGandM;In terms of the sample, there were many possible sources of informed opinionabout how organizations will exploit and capitalize on IT.andP;  Fugure 1illustrates major sources and their relevant interrelationships.andP;  One majorsource is scientists.andP;  In their exploration and creation of technologicalpossibilities, scientists perform basic research that enables newtechnologies.andP;  The discovery of room-temperature superconductors, forinstance, will be a basic discovery that will affect a host of othertechnologies.andP;  Engineers, a second possible source, translate scientificdiscoveries such as room-temperature superconductivity into real-worldapplications such as superconductive computers once they are deemed to beviable commercial products by vendors.andP;  On the other hand, futurists possessa degree of technical expertise that allows them to interpret basicscientific results, and hence represent another source of information.andP;  Theirinterpretations of technological potential can be used by informationmanagement experts, who, using this information and their reading oforganizational needs, influence decisions on technological adoption byutilizing organizations.andP;  Information management experts themselves mayrecommend to organizations innovations such as superconductive computers.andM;Information Management ExpertsandM;as Key Informants in the SampleandM;Because information management experts are uniquely positioned with stronglinks to all the major players involved in technological innovation, thisgroup was chosen to be key informants.andP;  Through their information sources,they are able to gain knowledge about organizational needs, commercialviability, and technical possibilities.andM;Key informant interviews with information management experts also have adistinct advantage in looking at both demand and supply.andP;  The demand fortechnologies emerges when they address an important organizational or socialneed, and, in a sense, therefore pull these technologies from themarketplace.andP;  Rapid growth and diffusion of technology occurs when a &quot;blastoff&quot; application area develops an area, such as automating the budgetary andplanning process through electronic spreadsheets.andP;  Current technologieslanguish because these critical applications areas do not exist.andO;Organizations may have more than sufficient software and hardware, but theymay lack truly creative software and hardware that satisfy in a direct andpersuasive fashion an important social need, solve an important socialproblem, or fulfill an important social role [5].andM;On the supply or technology-push side, it is valuable for forecasts to beable to identify IT that will have reached at least the take-off point intheir growth curve during the forecast window.andP;  In order for technologies todominate in terms of their organizational impact, they must be operational,having passed through some initial trial stages, and demonstrated marketplaceviability during at least the latter part of the forecasting window.andP;  Ifthese technologies are in a first-generation status during the forecastperiod, however, the solutions they offer may as yet be of minor importance.andM;There is no question but that the selection of a particular set of expertsbiases the findings.andP;  From the standpoint of the research design, however, itwas decided that the best way to gain macro-level understanding of theshifting organizational environment of the next decade was, in fact, toactively seek out these expert opinions with known biases.andP;  The operatingassumption is that only information management experts on the leading edge ofthese changes would be able to speak to the extremely broad organizationaland technological issue being addressed.andM;Thus, we sought a group for sampling that had access to and experience withutilizing organizations, vendors, and technological discoveries.andP;  While thisselection undoubtedly is biased, in our view the bias favors answering theresearch question.andP;  It is not as likely, for example, that technologyspecialists from MCC, the National Science Foundation, Bell Labs, and theOffice of Technology Assessment have as much exposure to the organizationalneeds that pull technology from the marketplace as the study group.andP;  Avendor-sampling approach has some advantages over technical experts becausesuccessful vendors carefully read the organizational pulse.andP;  Vendor bias,however, presents just as great a methodological problem.andP;  Interviews withvendors could easily lead to the promotion of products that are currentlyavailable rather than those that may soon be available.andP;  Vendors are alsolikely to be myopic about products outside their own company's product line.andM;Potential participants were selected from a larger set of informationmanagement experts well known to the I/S and computer science communities.andO;The final set of experts invited to participate were both conversant with theinformation technologies being studied and knowledgeable about the changeslikely to be wrought by these technologies.andM;Eleven key informants who were selected to participate in the study are shownin Table II.andP;  They were contacted and interviewed by telephone from Septemberto November of 1988.andP;  The response rate to requests for participation wasvery high (92 percent), only one of the original set of 12 expertsidentifying themselves as appropriate for the study declining to participate.andO;(1)  The high response rate suggests that results of the study have goodgeneralizability, given that the ideas and opinions of these key informantsare representative.andM;Research ProceduresandM;To ensure that participants would evaluate a similar domain of relevantinformation technologies, a list of technologies was provided in the coverletter soliciting participation.andP;  Designed simply as a memory prompt, thelist was randomly ordered to minimize primacy or recency effects for eachpotential participant.andP;  An alphabetical list with short definitionsaccompanied the letter for clarity and to assure that as similar a domain ofinterest as possible was being evaluated by all participants.andP;  Table IIIlists the information technologies presented to the participants.andO;Respondents were asked to add items to the list at their discretion.andP;  Thislist is shown in Table IV.andM;The original list of information technologies was developed in a year-longstudy of departmental level information resource management sponsored by theCouncil on Library Resources (cf.andP;  [21]).andP;  These technologies along withothers drawn from articles on emerging technologies comprised the list givento participants.andP;  As indicated earlier, participants were encouraged to addto the list, which they did throughout the interviews.andP;  While a few lateadditions did not receive enough response to permit conclusions to be drawn,most of the new entries were added before the fourth interview and weretherefore considered in the findings.andM;It is clear that the original list of information technologies given toparticipants was by no means exhaustive.andP;  Many different informationtechnologies could be included, technologies such as stereo lithography,RISC, language translation software, image processing, magnetic input,interactive simulation, fiber optics, and cellular telephones.andP;  But theoriginal list was intentionally restricted in order to maintain a manageablenumber of entries, allowing participants ample time to expand on why theyfelt particular technologies were well suited for particular organizationalproblems.andP;  Another factor that extended the original list was the inclusionof several technologies that have been deemphasized by recent forecasts.andO;These were added for comparison and verification purposes.andM;At the beginning of the semi-structured telephone interview, participantswere reminded of the need to identify technologies that will have thegreatest overall impact on organizations of the future.andP;  After this reminder,participants were given an option on how to answer the research question.andO;They could discuss the technologies in order of importance, in the coverletter order, in the alphabetical order of the short definition list, or inany other order of their choosing.andP;  They were also given the option ofgrouping technologies, if that seemed appropriate to them.andP;  The interview wassemistructured in the sense that researchers would ask questions only toclarify answers or to prompt participants to expand on responses concerningpreviously undiscussed technologies.andP;  Researchers prompted respondents toevaluate as many technologies as possible without attempting to beexhaustive.andP;  When respondents declined to discuss a technology, it wasassumed that no high impact was anticipated from that technology.andO;Interviews were taped and transcribed.andP;  Following the interview, notes takenduring the interview were expanded to capture the essence of the responses aswell as subtleties such as intonation, stress, and semantic contours.andO;Transcripts of tapes and notes were reviewed by both researchers forcross-validation and qualitative assessment of construct validity andreliability.andP;  Interviews ranged in length from 45 to 90 minutes, averagingabout 60 minutes.andM;A full report of the interviews was sent to respondents to verify theircontent.andP;  Corrections of content and intent were made by half of therespondents and were subsequently incorporated into the final analysis.andM;GENERAL FINDINGSandM;Without exception, study respondents felt that the business environment ofthe middle and late 1990s will be radically different from that of the 1980s.andO;Such changes will impact the entire corporate culture (Martin).andP;  In this newworld, &quot;information transfer between organizations&quot; and &quot;democratization ofthe accessibility of information [within] organizations&quot; will reachunprecedented levels (Hammer).andP;  The amount of change that organizations willhave to deal with on a day-to-day basis will be astounding by currentstandards.andP;  Some organizations will learn to respond to this quickened pacein which product and service cycles are drastically curtailed; others willnot.andM;The major changes that are expected for the next decade will not be incomputational capabilities or in new ways to manipulate data to supportmanagerial decision-making, although these will occur.andP;  Generalized decisionsupport systems (DSS), for example, will progress slowly over the period.andO;The real gains in productivity will come from giving knowledge workers directand immediate access to knowledge--both formal and informal information--thatthey have never had before.andP;  There was a consensus that we will be movingfrom an era of data dominance in the 1970s and 1980s [8] to an era ofknowledge dominance in the 1990s.andP;  What is going to count in the closingyears of the millennium is the ability to &quot;move high volumes of informationin multi-media forms, in varying sequences, back and forth between people andplaces where data is stored&quot; (Gerrity).andM;During the 1990s professionals and knowledge workers will work with systemsthat integrate the available technology for them at the task level (Dooley).andO;This task level integration of formal and informal information sources forsupervisory and management purposes in the future will lead to a thinning andflattening of management ranks, a trend which has already been documented[7].andP;  Momentous changes will result from a &quot;fundamental rethinking&quot; (Hammer)of the nature of the work people do and the nature of the work departmentsdo.andP;  Time-honored functions like accounts receivable, for example, coulddisappear as a result of higher level interconnectivities between cashmanagement and billing.andM;Unvaryingly, respondents felt that the computer and telecommunications wouldcontinue as engines of change in the coming decade and that emerging IT ofone kind or another would produce revolutionary changes in organizations.andP;  Asone might expect, there was disagreement on the impact of specifictechnologies, but surprising consensus on the impact of identifiedtechnological groups with the greatest impact.andM;SPECIFIC FINDINGSandM;When asked to evaluate the future impact of more than 29 informationtechnologies on the list, seven of 11 of the respondents explicitly orimplicitly created groupings of IT and discussed organizational impacts inthat context.andP;  In effect, respondents chose to conceptualize the question ofcritical information technologies at a higher level of abstraction.andO;Participants tended to group the technologies into five primary areas.andP;  Rankordered according to perceived impact on organizations, they are:andM;1) Human interface technologies--IT that substantially improves thehuman-machine interface;andM;2) Communication technologies--IT that greatly enhances data andperson-to-person communications;andM;3) System support technologies with indirect impacts--IT that underwritessystems development and maintenance;andM;4) Technologies with limited impact in the 1990s, andandM;5) Technologies not yet mature during the 1990s.andM;It is important to note that these groupings were not mere study artifacts.andO;Respondents were questioned independently and were blind to the makeup of thesample; the researchers, moreover, had no prior expectancy that respondentswould choose to group the technologies in any particular manner.andP;  Thegroupings, hence, arose naturally from participants' perceptions that theinformation technologies under scrutiny were highly interrelated.andM;The following discussion of technologies and impacts is organized accordingto these technological groupings and then by observations on individualtechnologies.andP;  The top-ranked technology groups are shown in Table V. (2)andM;GROUP 1:andM;Human Interface TechnologiesandM;Eight out of the 11 participants indicated a large number of the technologieson the list were part of a wave of powerful new interface technologies, ortechnologies that make it possible for knowledge workers to readily accesscomputerized information.andP;  It was believed that existing interfaces have notreached an acceptable level of usability, and, as a result of this relativelyhostile user environment, current utilization of computer technology does noteven roughly approach the capacity of modern processors to provideinformation.andP;  In short, most participants saw present day systems as beingmarkedly underutilized because the human interface is too difficult fornoncomputer-literate users to master.andP;  With the entry into the marketplace ofextremely friendly and natural interfaces--&quot;high quality&quot; interfaces(Emery)--managers, professionals, and administrative assistants will findthemselves using computers more intelligently and with greater frequency.andO;The nature, efficiency, and effectiveness of their work will, in fact, bealtered in such a profound way that we will see greater productivityimprovements in administrative processes than have occurred since theindustrial revolution.andP;  The overall impact of these IT on organizations ofthe 1990s, in short, is forecast to be enormous.andM;In general, user interfaces will succeed in direct proportion to theirability to approximate normal human modes of interpersonal exchange.andP;  Becausepeople are voice-oriented and human-oriented in their interpersonal exchangesof information, the most &quot;natural&quot; interfaces, therefore, will attempt toapproximate human interactions (Dooley).andP;  User friendly systems, in otherwords, will gain greater acceptance and have a greater impact in the future.andM;As technical capabilities for speech recognition as an input mode evolve bythe late 1990s (Martin), voice input and output interfaces will have apronounced impact.andP;  They will obviate the need for keyboards and evenrudimentary typing skills.andP;  Intelligent, expert system/artificialintelligence interfaces that permit users to express their needs in a formmore natural to them (&quot;natural language interfaces&quot;) will also be critical inmeeting the overall objective of user-friendly systems.andP;  Even though suchnatural language interfaces will still be relatively crude in the 1990s (cf.andO;[3, 22]), they will represent a major improvement over present-daybelligerent user interfaces (Joseph).andP;  In the late 1990s the system itselfwill become an active rather than a passive partner in interpreting userrequests for information.andP;  Users will have a choice of &quot;multiple modes ofinterface&quot; (Martin) as transitional technologies, the mouse, light pen,touch-sensitive screens and the like pave the way for late-developingtechnologies with vastly superior natural interfaces.andP;  Participants disagreedon the issue of how soon such intelligent, speech systems will be reachingthe marketplace though the majority believed that they would come of age atsome point during the study window.andM;One area that was perceived as having achieved a more advanced interface thanother management support systems, and in fact one of the compellingexplanations for the growth of this relatively new technology, was executiveinformation systems (EIS).andP;  Of the 10 percent of senior-level executivespresently using these systems, most are able to do so because EIS interfacesenable non-technical executives to interface with the system easily andeffectively (Rockart).andP;  By the end of the millennium, virtually allsenior-level executives will be using EIS which will directly impacthigh-level executive decision-making (Berger) and thereby the overallperformance of the organization.andM;GROUP 2:andM;Communications TechnologiesandM;Respondents grouped another set of technologies under the broad heading ofcommunications.andP;  Individual use of the term varied, but an underlying conceptwas IT that permits both individuals and computer processes to rapidlytransmit and receive information over distances.andP;  Both computers exchangingdata and people exchanging messages were placed in this category byparticipants.andP;  This set might be thought of, therefore, as IT that rapidlybrings information from its many sources and many forms to people.andP;  Ineffect, these technologies allow organizations to ignore geography andconduct activities--even trans-global activities--as though they were local(Emery).andP;  More importantly, this set of technologies has the potential toproduce a &quot;quickening of the patterns of communications&quot; (McFarlan) by addingsignificantly to the potential for &quot;dispersed cooperative activities&quot;(Emery).andM;Specific technologies that respondents saw as profoundly affecting &quot;the waypeople interact, form teams, and pass knowledge back and forth&quot; (Gerrity)were voice-mail and electronic mail (E-mail).andP;  The primary value of thesetechnologies, according to seven of 11 participants, was their ability tofacilitate procedural matters, like scheduling meetings, while, on the otherhand, allowing people to dialogue electronically and reduce face-to-facemeeting time.andP;  They would, in fact, allow knowledge workers to &quot;conduct andtransact business&quot; much more easily (Berger).andP;  Respondents also saw them asvaluable in speeding up the decision-making process and binding it into aseamless whole.andP;  Another function served by voice-mail and E-mail was adramatic increase in dissemination of knowledge about or understanding ofproblems.andM;By comparison to these systems, FAX was singled out as a low-tech solution tocommunications problems and serves an important transitional need oforganizations for rapid transmission of documents.andP;  In the more highlyintegrated information environment of the late 1990s, however, papertechnologies will give way to paperless, purely electronic technologies.andM;Network-related technologies such as VSAT, networks, ISDN, andvideo-conferencing were viewed as extremely important because they enrich thecommunication channels between geographically dispersed individuals andgroups as well as offering greatly enhanced data channels.andP;  Asinter-organizational systems continue to grow, wider bandwidths offered inVSAT technology combined with the data and software standardization offeredby EDI are seen as contributing to a critical need for large-scale dataexchange between computer processes.andP;  These technologies will directlysupport the way in which organizations interrelate their business functions,and, for that reason alone, will assume a major role in shaping the future(Morgan, Keen).andM;Although many participants saw CD-ROM and other optical storage technologiesas part of the category labelled &quot;System support&quot; technologies, they also sawthem as indispensable for the storage of the massive amounts of informationbeing communicated in the 1990s.andP;  Technologies like CD-ROM are beingintegrated so quickly and quietly into the fabric of business functioningthat the &quot;CD-ROM revolution has come and gone without anyone in Americanoticing&quot; (Keen).andP;  Large-scale relational databases were perceived as anothercritical component in the technological future with its exponentiallyincreasing information exchange, and like CD-ROM, were sometimes categorizedboth in the communications group and sometimes in the systems support group.andO;Database machines were not generally seen as part of this solution byparticipants.andP;  The sense was that general processors are going to be fastenough to handle the higher processing requirements of large-scale relationaldatabases (Morgan).andM;To the extent that high-end workstations will alleviate current problems bothwith communications and with interfaces, some of these difficulties will besolved during the 1990s.andP;  High-end, color workstations will serve as theinterface of choice for E-mail and voice mail messages, visual transmissions,images such as graphics and FAX documents, video conferences, audio tapes,and traditional data sources (internal and external) and transactionprocessing systems.andP;  Intelligent workstations will provide transparentlysimple linkages to information, enabling knowledge workers to reach a newplateau of mental productivity.andP;  These advanced technological aids will allowboth individuals and groups to become more productive in how they think aboutproblems and solutions to problems and how they implement decisions (Morgan).andM;Desktop publishing was among the important technologies in the communicationsgroup that specifically impacts personal productivity.andP;  While there wasagreement that this capability will improve the quality of information beingdisseminated internally and externally by organizations, there wasdisagreement on the extent of the changes because some of the competitiveadvantages being offered are not sustainable.andM;GROUP 3:andM;System Support TechnologiesandM;with Indirect ImpactsandM;Respondents chose to group another set of technologies into system support orbuilding block tools that will produce major second-order effects on the wayorganizations conduct business in the 1990s (cf.andP;  Table VI).andP;  Thesetechnologies are expected to provide a ground-work for the development ofbetter large and small systems, ones that can be created in a more timely andcost-effective fashion, and systems that can enable ready access to data.andO;Ultimately, this heightened capability to respond quickly to informationalneeds and strategic opportunities will radically change the organization, butthe effect will be felt indirectly, through the success of variousorganizational units.andP;  CASE (Computer-Aided Systems Engineering) illustratesthe indirect impact within this group.andP;  Most of the respondents saw CASE asan important technology that will reach its majority during the 1990s timeframe, but others saw it as a first-generation technology that will not beable to have a major impact on the systems development process until we havea more complete and better understanding of exactly how the process works.andO;The value of CASE lies in its ability to automate &quot;the human designer andcoder&quot; (Emery), a fundamental change in the way systems are built.andP;  CASEproducts and the capabilities of reverse engineering will powerfully impactthe systems profession during the next five years and thereafter its effectswill be felt by the end-user community (Martin).andP;  Because a great deal mustbe in place before CASE can be extremely useful, CASE is a &quot;limited, ...andO;highly leveraged technology&quot; (Gerrity).andM;Participants highlighted other system support technologies as having &quot;anability to put systems together in a much more effective way than we've doneit in the past&quot; (Emery).andP;  Relational databases and 4GLs were key technologiesin this grouping along with CASE while prototyping was ranked lower by therespondents.andP;  Even so, respondents did feel that prototyping would continueto be an important systematic methodology.andP;  They stressed the usefulness ofprototyping in speeding up the development process and in producing higherquality systems.andM;A number of system support technologies were also indicated by respondents asbelonging to this category.andP;  These are technologies that become part of thebackground, &quot;part of the air we breathe&quot; (McFarlan).andP;  Faster and fasterchips, represented in the study by 32-bit and advanced chips such as the80286 and 80386 (to be followed by the &quot;486&quot; and &quot;586&quot;), will be importantcomponents of the technology base of the 1990s and will be responsible forspeeding up work but will not achieve the same transforming potential of theother system support technologies.andM;The future role of hypertext/hypermedia was perceived in very different waysby the participants.andP;  Some saw it as an important and valuable extension ofthe relational database concept in making computer systems more easilyaccessible to knowledge workers.andP;  Some saw it being combined synergisticallywith large-scale memory technologies like CD-ROM and intelligent interfacesto open up new avenues for information accessibility (Martin).andP;  Still otherssaw it as fundamentally transforming &quot;the way people work&quot; (Hammer).andP;  Mostrespondents, in short, felt that hypermedia had an important role to play inthe storage and retrieval of information, but there was little consensus onexactly what the nature of that role would be.andM;GROUP 4:andM;Limited Impact TechnologiesandM;As Table VII indicates, study participants identified a fourth group oftechnologies that will continue to make important contributions withoutrevolutionizing the way organizations function.andP;  Some of these wererevolutionary at one time and did have a transforming presence; others didnot.andP;  Mature technologies like mainframes and minicomputers will continue togrow slowly in the 1990s, as will IT like CAD/CAM, but respondents did notanticipate that they will have pronounced organizational effects.andP;  It isbelieved, however, that minis will continue to be important in decentralizedcomputing (Joseph), which, along with local area networks (LANs), willaccompany a boom in departmental computing (cf.andP;  also [2], [21]).andM;Also among the limited impact technologies were word processing software andparallel processing architectures.andP;   Word processing software will continueto become part of the infrastructure of the organizations, but someparticipants did not rank word processing software among the transformingtechnologies of the past because it does not fundamentally alter office taskssuch as typing.andP;  Although technically mature during this period, parallelprocessing architectures were viewed as having a specialized impact in thattheir use is typically limited to scientific and R andamp; D departments of mostorganizations.andM;Probably the most controversial finding in the study was that, other thantheir use as front ends for the human interface and as embedded systems,expert systems (ES) and artificial intelligence (AI) will not beorganizationally important (or will be of highly circumscribed importance)during the closing decade of the millennium.andP;  The study interviews revealedsomething of a &quot;crisis of faith&quot; among the information management keyinformants, many of whom have been past advocates of these technologies.andO;Several indicated past high levels of expectation for these technologies butnow feel that ES and AI during the last 20 years have not fulfilled theirpromise.andP;  Questions about the organizational impact of ES have been raisedbefore.andP;  When he was editor of MIS Quarterly, William King referred to themas the &quot;snake oil of the 80s&quot; [13].andP;  Likewise, a number of participants sawstand-alone ES as useful (but not critically important) in trainingapplications, believing ES should be more properly termed &quot;novice systems.&quot;andO;A more significant role for ES will occur in embedding them in ongoingtransactional systems (Emery, Martin).andP;  Finally, a very significant area ofapplication for ES and AI, already discussed, will be as a front end fornatural language systems.andM;The dissenting opinion among the respondents held that ES and AI will becritical technologies in the 1990s.andP;  These respondents believed thatorganizations are even now on the verge of realizing a major return on theirconsiderable investments in ES and AI (Martin).andP;  In this they concur withspecialists such as Feigenbaum [10] that thousands of viable applications areeven now transforming essential business functions and that ES will become&quot;the wealth of nations&quot; (Joseph).andM;Certain technologies under the communications grouping were seen asimportant, but as emerging slowly in this period.andP;  It is expected thatcomputer-mediated conferencing will have an important but limited role in thenext 10 years.andP;  Organizations' immediate need for enhanced communicationswill be met by simpler solutions, like E-mail and voice-mail.andP;  Computerizedlibraries, on-line external database searching, and data extraction andconversion software were also placed in this category.andP;  Even thoughcomputerized libraries, for example, would be &quot;a valuable increment in ourcapabilities&quot; (Emery), their impact will be limited, first affectingresearchers and only later management (Joseph).andM;Communications technologies that will not create major changes during the1990s include PBXs and calendaring/tickling software.andM;GROUP 5:andM;Technologies Not Yet MatureandM;As shown in Table VIII, IT considered to be potentially important but not yettechnically mature during the decade of the 1990s were nanotechnology,biomolecular computing, and neural networks.andP;  With few exceptions,respondents saw these technologies as harbingers of the &quot;engines ofabundance&quot; (Joseph) that will transform organizations after the year 2000.andO;Such technologies, producing computers that store and manipulate virtuallyendless amounts of information as well as approximate human capabilities forthought, may well develop at some future time, but the key informants did notanticipate them having widespread influence before the turn of themillennium.andM;Limitations and DirectionsandM;for Further ResearchandM;The selection of information management experts who have in-depthunderstanding of organizational needs, commercial viability, andtechnological advances is a bias that could conceivably affect the accuracyof the forecast.andP;  Future impacts researchers should consider sampling fromother cultures within the IT impacts area, experts with the purely computerscience perspective, information retrieval experts, visionaries, andsociologists.andP;  With such diverse expertise to draw on, many differingperspectives could be elicited [11] and our understanding thereby enhanced.andO;Focus group and nominal group techniques for the technology forecast mightalso improve the richness of the findings.andM;Another limitation is the ad hoc procedure for identifying technologies.andO;Even though the original list and the appended list evolved out of a processof inquiry, there were other technologies, admittedly, that could have beenincluded.andP;  Improving the forecasting method with a definitive list oftechnologies would best be coupled with a technique that permitted a largersample size, such as a Delphi survey.andP;  Content validity could be greatlyimproved by randomly selecting technology entries for each participant.andM;In our opinion, applications of this work to MIS research is an importantoutcome of the study.andP;  It is critically important that MIS researchersmonitor trends in the technological environment in order to direct theirinterests toward practice in the real world information climate.andP;  There are,of course, many kinds of research that can be pursued independent oftechnological change--for example, how individuals and groups processinformation in organizational settings.andP;  Nevertheless, the bulk of researchin MIS will probably remain technology-driven [1].andP;  To the extent that it isdesirable to know about changes wrought by technology, technological impactsimplied by study findings can be useful to MIS researchers.andM;Based on findings here, it may be inferred that streams of research thatalign themselves with those technologies having the greatest impact will bevitally important in the development of emerging information environments.andO;Research in the human-machine interface, for instance, can influence softwareand hardware interfaces and shed light on how such technologies can besuccessfully integrated into organizations.andP;  Communications technologies willlikewise have major effects on internal work patterns andintra-organizational systems, and, therefore, studies on the nature of theserelationships may make major contributions.andP;  Studies on the efficiency andeffectiveness of systems support technologies, like CASE, will also beinstrumental in the coming decade.andP;  Since the most meaningful uses of ES/AIare thought to be in natural language interfaces and embedded systems,research in these areas should be pursued vigorously, though not to theexclusion of other forms of ES/AI research.andM;Discussion and Implications for PracticeandM;The study revealed that during the 1990s certain information technologygroups will be dominant in terms of instrumental impact, i.e., highorganizational impact.andP;  Usable systems will be the key item on theorganizational agenda with communicable systems also ranking very high on thelist.andP;  System support technologies will speed the systems development processfor both I/S staffs and end users.andP;  In all likelihood some technologies willhave limited impact while other first-generation IT will evolve to a positionof significance only after the turn of the millennium.andM;The study findings corroborate theoreticians such as Huber [12] who arguesthat organizations in the 1990s will be under enormous pressure to handleinformation efficiently and effectively.andP;  Dramatic increases in the intensityof competitive forces, shortened production cycles for new products andservices, and huge volumes of readily available information are some of thefeatures of this future landscape that will make IT invaluable.andP;  In fact,those organizations that do not manage this transition from an industrialorientation to an information orientation will very likely suffer extinction.andO;This finding suggests that strategic planning by top management must takeinto account ways that IT can revolutionize internal procedures andpractices, however problematic this can be [9].andM;Organizations in the 1990s will be transformed by computers withuser-friendly interfaces.andP;  Interfaces that demonstrate high levels ofintelligence will simplify the task of seeking out, channelling andmanipulating informational sources.andP;  Among the scenarios to be carefullyconsidered by technology investigation units is an office that processes,stores, and searches personal, departmental, and organizational-levelinformation by several orders of magnitude over the present.andP;  Thistransformation will result in knowledge workers exploring far beyond presentinformation boundaries as a result of ease of use.andP;  This social change willbe accompanied by vastly expanded communications links made possible by thenetworking technologies.andP;  Office and factory workers will be able to senddata and human messages in ways that can be adapted to the task at hand.andM;The office of the late 1990s can now be envisioned.andP;  Its staff ofprofessionals and managers are surrounded by intelligent devices that speak,listen, or interact with them to determine what is to be accomplished and howit is to be done.andP;  Contacts with other departments, other divisions,customers, vendors, and other organizations are made with little effort andwithout human intervention.andP;  Behind the scenes, systems are being developedby system developers equipped with versatile and highly integrated software.andM;If this futuristic scene is to come into being, both I/S and generalmanagement will have to ensure that sufficient attention is given toinnovation and diffusion of user-friendly human interfaces.andP;  The studyfindings indicate that this area will provide the greatest return oninvestment.andP;  In particular, software products must be rigorously tested forusability as well as error-free performance before diffusing IT throughoutthe organization.andP;  Technologies that integrate facilities at the knowledgeworker task level will also be of particular value and should be closelystudied for possible adoption.andM;Forward-looking organizations should continue or increase their commitment tocommunications technologies.andP;  High volume, high speed data transfer oftraditional formal information through standardized protocols will becritical success factors in the future, but the relatively lower-techsolutions for informal communications, namely, E-mail, voice-mail and FAX,are also needed and should be promulgated.andM;In sum, where management understands the potential of these high returninformation technologies and takes steps to implement them, they will be ableto respond more proactively to the expected turbulence and functionalfragmentation of the 1990s.andM;(1) The researchers wanted to include female information management expertsamong the participants, but were not able to achieve this goal.andP;  One of thecontributing reasons for this was that the female information expert who didfeel she was appropriate for the study declined to participate.andM;(2) Respondents perceived IT as both general purpose systems, such as ESshells or inference engines, and specific purpose systems, such as a specificES.andP;  They were responding to EIS in the abstract as well as the Pilot andComshare applications of the concept.andM;REFERENCESandM;[1] Banville, C., and Landry, M.andP;  Can the field of MIS be disciplined?andO;Commun.andP;
