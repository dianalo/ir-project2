The House voted 347-53 to approve a compromise version worked out by a small group of influential lawmakers earlier this week. The House action, which followed a 97-1 vote in the Senate, capped months of frustration in Congress over efforts to reconcile the differing versions that had cleared each chamber earlier.    The compromise measure, which President Reagan is expected to sign, would cost an estimated $3.34 billion over five years. That is slightly more than the $2.8 billion originally sought by the Senate but far less than the $7 billion price tag of the original House bill.    The measure requires that most welfare recipients whose children are over the age of three participate in work, training or education programs approved or established by the states. The states must maintain child-care assistance and health insurance during such training periods, and continue the assistance for as much as one year after the recipient finds a job.    The states will also be required to extend welfare benefits to two-parent families in which both parents are unemployed; only 26 states currently offer such coverage.    To win White House support for the measure, Congress agreed to require these families to send at least one parent to work for a minimum of 16 hours a week in some form of government or community-service job. This requirement won't take effect until the fiscal year beginning Oct 1., 1993, however.    The states must also begin withholding court-ordered child-support payments from the wages of all absent parents, whether or not they are in the program and whether or not they are in arrears. The step is designed not only to boost welfare recipients' income but to lessen the government's cost for some programs while underscoring the importance of parental responsibility.    Funding for the measure is to come from several sources, including new requirements for taxpayers with children.    Beginning next year, taxpayers who claim the child-care tax credit will be required to list the name, address and Social Security or other taxpayer-identification number of the child-care provider. Committee staffers said the provision is expected to raise $529 million in tax revenue over the next five years from babysitters who aren't reporting their incomes fully.    Second, to raise $25 million over five years from unpaid taxes on toddlers' incomes, taxpayers would have to furnish Social Security numbers for dependents as young as two years, down from five years under the current law.    The new bill would also lower to 13 from 15 the maximum age of dependents for whom taxpayers can claim the child-care credit or for whom they can exclude employer-provided child care from taxable income. This provision will raise an estimated $375 million over five years.    And the bill would require that the amount of child-care expenses eligible for the tax credit be reduced by the dollar value of child care provided by the employer and excluded from the taxpayer's income, to raise $55 million over five years.    The largest share of funding for the bill, $2 billion, would come from extending for five years an expiring Internal Revenue Service program under which debts owed to the government are deducted from income-tax returns. It would also raise $350 million by requiring that reimbursed business expenses, for which employees don't have to account, be treated as &quot;miscellaneous itemized deductions.&quot; This means they will be deductible only to the extent that they exceed 2% of gross income, rather than being fully deductible as in current law. </TEXT></DOC>
