Most wheat and soybean futures also slipped lower on the ChicagoBoard of Trade, and coffee futures joined sugar in falling for athird straight day on New York's Coffee, Sugar andamp; Cocoa Exchange.   On other markets, precious metals were lower; cattle were upwhile pork futures plunged; and energy futures were mixed.   Thursday marked the fifth consecutive day of falling cornfutures prices and the ninth straight daily drop in the price forAugust delivery of soybeans.   But in a departure from the past three months, the weather hadlittle impact on the markets, analysts said.   Instead, they said corn traders were watching their market'sopen interest, a rough measure of the number of speculators whohave _ in effect _ placed their bets but not collected theirwinnings.   Open interest has been running at an unusually high level in thecorn market and stood at more than 244,000 contracts when themarket opened Thursday.   The majority of the open interest was believed to represent``long'' positions, or wagers that prices would rise. Since priceshave been falling, some players feared that many holders of thoselong positions were preparing to sell and either cut their lossesor settle for only a slight profit.   A sudden, massive sell-off would cause prices to plummet andsome traders tried to beat the rush by selling ahead of it, whichcaused corn prices to fall sharply anyway.   The selling sentiment spread to the neighboring wheat andsoybean pits, causing prices to fall in those markets, too, saidWalter Spilka, an analyst in New York with Smith Barney, HarrisUpham andamp; Co.   The National Weather Service's latest 6-to-10-day forecast,calling for normal rainfall next week in the drought-strickenMidwest, was bearish but it was not a major factor in Thursday'saction, Spilka said.   ``I think weather forecasts are maybe contributing about halfthe influence right now (and) I think near-term forecasts are moreimportant than the 6-to-10-days,'' he said.   Wheat settled 4 cents to 5{ cents lower with the contract fordelivery in September at $3.57 a bushel; corn was 14} cents lowerto 2 cents higher with September at $2.65 a bushel; oats were 3cents lower to 7{ cents higher with September at $2.56{ a bushel;and soybeans were 12 cents lower to 15 cents higher with August at$7.41{ a bushel.   The situation was similar in the sugar market, which ignored thebullish news of new sugar purchases by China and plummeted to itslowest level in about a month.   ``This was a technically driven sell-off,'' said Judith Ganes,sugar analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in New York.   Sugar futures have been extremely strong and stood at 6{-yearhighs on Monday. Ms. Ganes said the market fundamentals remainedbullish and that the nearly 3{-cent plunge over three days ``justgives you better bargains.''   Sugar for October delivery settled .53 cent lower at 10.82 centsa pound.   Coffee futures continued their technically-driven decline withthe September contract settling .26 cent lower at $1.2379 a pound.   The continuing decline in the grain markets forced somespeculators with additional holdings in silver and platinum futuresto take profits in the metals markets so they could meet theirfinancial obligations in the grain markets, said Bette Raptopoulos,an analyst in New York with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.   Gold was more stable in its traditional role as a ``safe haven''for investment dollars, she said.   On New York's Commodity Exchange, gold settled 70 cents to $1lower with August at $432.50 a troy ounce; silver was 25.8 cents to29.6 cents lower with August at $6.707 a troy ounce.   Hog and pork-belly futures fell their respective daily limits of1.50 cents and 2 cents a pound on the Chicago Mercantile Exchangebecause ``there's too much supply and not enough demand, period,''said Chuck Levitt, an analyst in Chicago with Shearson LehmanHutton Inc.   Cattle futures followed the grains to a mixed close, Levitt said.   Live cattle were .87 cent lower to .33 cent higher with Augustat 66.42 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .05 cent lower to .93cent higher with August at 79.75 cents a pound; hogs were 1.12cents to 1.50 cents lower with August at 43.87 cents a pound; andfrozen pork bellies were 1.32 cents to 2 cents lower with August at30.95 cents a pound.   Crude oil prices were little changed in quiet trading on the NewYork Mercantile Exchange as traders waited for an upcoming OPECcommittee meeting.   West Texas Intermediate crude oil was 1 cent to 2 cents lowerwith September at $16.15 a barrel; heating oil was .23 cent to .69cent lower with August at 44.34 cents a gallon; unleaded gasolinewas .11 cent lower to 1.15 cents higher with August at 51.95 centsa gallon.</TEXT></DOC>
