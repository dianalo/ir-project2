The justices said Monday they will decide whether the increasedassessment represented ``systematic and intentional''discrimination against the Allegheny Pittsburgh Coal Co., asubsidiary of Allegheny Power System Inc.   The West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals upheld the assessmentby a 3-2 vote last July 17.   The justices today also granted a separate, similar appeal fromthree other coal companies owning land in Webster County.   Allegheny Pittsburgh bought the land, in numerous tracts, in1974 for about $24.6 million.   The total assessed value assigned to all the tracts of realestate was $488,000 in 1975. But that assessment was raised in 1976to $12.3 million, half the 1974 purchase price.   Allegheny Pittsburgh challenged the new assessment, and repeatedthat challenge for each tax year through 1982.   The company sold the real estate, along with the mineral rightsattached to it, in 1982 to East Kentucky Energy Corp. for $29.8million.   The proper assessment in 1984 was raised to $14.9 million toreflect 50 percent of the 1982 purchase price.   County officials testified that all recently sold property wasassessed at 50 percent of its sale price. They also testified thatproperty not sold during the same six-year period receivedcomparatively modest assessment increases.   A state trial judge ruled that Allegheny Pittsburgh's assessmentincrease violated the state constitution and the equal protectionguaranteed by the federal Constitution's 14th Amendment.   But the state Supreme Court of Appeals reversed that ruling.   In a separate appeal granted review today, East Kentucky Energy,Oneida Coal Co. and Shamrock Coal Co. challenged the way WebsterCounty formulates property tax assessments.   Their appeal noted that recently sold property is being assessedand taxed ``at a level as much as 6,500 percent higher thanproperties stipulated and found to be comparable in every pertinentrespect.''   East Kentucky Energy is a subsidiary of Shell Oil Co. OneidaCoal and Shamrock Coal are both subsidiaries of Sun Co. Inc.   The cases are Allegheny Pittsburgh vs. County Commission ofWebster County, 87-1303, and East Kentucky Energy vs. CountyCommission, 87-1310.</TEXT></DOC>
