SNIFFEN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writers</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Some senior federal judges think the taxpayersare getting a bargain from the semi-retired jurists even thoughdozens accept pay raises after they stop all judicial work.   But other senior judges are concerned _ even angry _ thatcolleagues take pay boosts without working. A third group issatisfied with current pay levels for semi-retired judges butbelieves that younger, full-time judges deserve more money.   An Associated Press survey, conducted in February and March, ofthe nation's 277 senior federal judges found that 48, or 17 percent,no longer do any judicial work. Nevertheless, they remain eligible _and in most cases, eager _ for any pay raises granted to activejudges. The survey was undertaken because the government refuses torelease its own data on the workload of individual senior judges.   The AP found most judges reduce their workload when they takesenior status; many give up criminal cases; some drop complicatedcivil cases. Nevertheless, they handle 10 to 15 percent of the totalfederal court workload, which is considered a godsend by their 750active colleagues.   ``You can't make a judge work if he doesn't want to work,'' saidBailey Aldrich, at age 81 a working senior appeals court judge inMassachusetts.   ``I wrote a letter to a congressman that getting the senior judgea raise, even though he wasn't working anymore, was a small price topay to get rid of ... (active judges) who are old.''   Congress created senior status in 1919 to encourage older judgeswith life appointments to step aside for younger replacements.   Federal judges of a certain age and experience may take seniorstatus which allows them to decide how much work they do.   Those who instead choose full retirement through resignation keepfor life the same salary they had on their last day of work. Thereare only 13 of these.   In February, senior judges and their active colleagues weredenied a 50 percent pay raise when Congress rejected increases fortop officials across the government.   Two new bills in Congress would add 20 to 30 percent to judicialsalaries. Trial judges are paid $89,500 a year, and appellate judgesearn more _ up to $115,000 for the chief justice.   The AP survey found no senior judge who has stopped hearing casesand was willing to forgo any pay raise. Ronald Davies, an84-year-old senior trial judge in North Dakota, was typical of mostwho addressed the issue:   ``I'm a senior judge and I get paid whether I work or not. I feltit (the raise Congress rejected) was long overdue.'' Davies, whotook senior status in 1971 and stopped hearing cases altogether sixmonths ago, planned to accept that raise.   But some still-working senior judges felt differently.   ``If you don't want to do the work, retire and get out,'' saidRaymond J. Pettine, a 76-year-old trial judge in Rhode Island whohas maintained a full caseload since taking senior status in 1982.   ``I think there probably should be some requirement that theywork to a certain extent,'' said John Minor Wisdom, a fabled NewOrleans judge who at 83 worked on appeals courts in four states lastyear.   John T. Elfvin, 71, a senior trial judge in Buffalo, N.Y., whohandles about 66 percent of a normal caseload, said, ``There oughtto be a look taken at individual situations. At some point, a judgeshould be cut off from getting senior status.''   Other senior judges endorsed raises for active judges to attractqualified younger lawyers in an era of soaring salaries for privateattorneys, but were content with their own salaries.   ``The job is worth the money, the $135,000 (which Congressrejected), for an active judge,'' said Eugene R. Gordon, a seniortrial judge in North Carolina, who at 71 carries a 50 percentworkload. ``For what you're paying me on senior status, $89,500,it's fine, but we are going to have to raise the salaries to attractgood people.''   The AP reported in January that a previously undisclosed 1987federal court study showed 20 percent of senior judges did nojudicial work. That study tracked trials and cases completed during12 months, but identified the judges only by code number.   The AP survey, which found that 17 percent do no judicial work,unlike the 1987 study, gave judges credit for dormant, butunresolved cases even though they have not required recent judicialaction.   The non-working senior judges include such famous figures asretired Chief Justice Warren E. Burger and Watergate trial judgeJohn J. Sirica.   Of the 48, Sirica and 19 others suffer from serious healthproblems that either limit or preclude continued judicial work.   Others devote their energies to pursuits away from thecourthouse, ranging from managing their investments to serving fulltime on public commissions, like Burger who heads the bicentennialcelebrations for the Constitution and Bill of Rights.   But there are senior judges who stay with court work, or try to,despite enormous obstacles.   In North Carolina, 75-year-old senior trial judge Woodrow Jonesmaintained a 75 percent caseload until his larynx was removed lastOctober. Unable to speak, he still works on petitions and motionsthat can be handled with written orders.   In Baltimore, 88-year-old former chief trial judge Roszel C.Thomsen was forced by failing hearing to give up cases, but he comesto the courthouse every day to serve as consultant or researcher forother judges.   The mixed feelings about pay raises were summed up by Frank M.Coffin, an appeals court judge in Portland, Me., who took seniorstatus last month:   ``At age 88, they become sick and they can't judge any more. Arethey to be deprived at the end of their life of a small incrementthat is probably the only thing that can be added to their estate?That's the most sympathetic case,'' Coffin said.   ``The least sympathetic case is the senior judge who at a veryearly age decides not to hear cases and takes senior status. I wouldnot object to taking a hard look at that situation.''</TEXT></DOC>
