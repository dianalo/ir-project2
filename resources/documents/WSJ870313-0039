The recommendations of the 25-member NASA Advisory Council echo others made since last year's Challenger disaster. The accident, many space analysts have said, demonstrated that the U.S. erred in placing too much reliance on the shuttle -- a policy that crippled the space program when the shuttle was grounded.    The advisory group urged the agency to request a supplemental appropriation immediately to begin buying unmanned rockets -- including some capable of carrying very heavy payloads into space.    &quot;Without action now, the nation's civil space program -- especially that in space science, which has till now been a shining example of U.S. space leadership -- will be damaged to a degree from which recovery will be extremely difficult and expensive,&quot; warned Daniel Fink, chairman of the council, in a letter to NASA Administrator James Fletcher that accompanied the report.    President Reagan's budget doesn't include funds for unmanned rockets for NASA for the next two fiscal years. But NASA is expected to send Congress a supplemental request for expendable rockets once the administration has decided what form the nation's space fleet should take. House Science and Technology Committee Chairman Robert Roe (D., N.J.) has said that Congress will have to provide NASA $100 million for unmanned rockets for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1 alone.    In the years preceding the Challenger disaster, NASA phased out production of unmanned rockets, arguing that the shuttle would ferry commercial, scientific and military cargo to orbit. When the Challenger accident occurred, the space agency had only a few unmanned rockets left in its inventory. As a result, a tremendous backlog of payloads awaiting launch has developed.    &quot;The task force recommends a major evolution in NASA policy from one that has maximized the use of the shuttle to a policy that preserves the space transportation fleet for those critical missions that require its unique capabilities,&quot; the council said.    It added that it was unlikely the space agency could handle more than 12 shuttle flights a year. NASA has projected as many as 16 flights a year when the shuttle fleet is fully operational. </TEXT></DOC>
