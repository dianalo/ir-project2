I have a special interest in these events, because as a member of the House Committee that wrote the Alaskan Pipeline Act in 1973, I heard Exxon and Alyeska officials maintain that there would never be a serious oil spill. But, they assured us, if a spill ever did occur, state-of-the-art technology would be ready to clean it up without serious damage to animals, fish or landscape. Their talk turned out to be cheap, but their overconfidence has cost a terrible sum.    An astonishing fact emerged from the House Interior Committee's hearings during our visit to Alaska two months ago: When the accident occurred, Alyeska and Exxon officials were not prepared to implement their contingency plans to clean up oil spills because they had believed the computers that told them such an accident could happen only once every 241 years.    Alyeska made no serious effort at containment even though for three days after the accident the weather kept most of the crude in the vicinity of the Valdez. Had Alyeska been able to implement its contingency plan, almost all of the spill could have been recovered within 72 hours, according to a study by the Alaskan Department of Environmental Conservation. Instead, Alyeska fiddled away the first three days, and then tossed responsibility off to Exxon.    The public was understandably infuriated by the spill, and officials -- company and government -- panicked. Whatever could be done, at whatever cost, was begun. This week Exxon estimated its costs at $1.28 billion, making the spill the world's most costly disaster. Three thousand cleanup workers, 7,000 support workers, 50 landing craft, 27 barges and many hundreds of other boats are involved.    What is all that money accomplishing? Not much. Worse, workers may be doing more harm than good to the fragile bays and beaches of Prince William Sound. The floating pools and puddles of oil I saw two months ago have been cleaned up. But during my quiet visits last week, the massive cleaning operations on rocks and beaches appeared to be reaping little return while causing significant environmental degradation.    On Eleanor Island I found nearly 500 men and women working at seemingly fruitless tasks: spraying rocks with hot water from high-pressure hoses without visible success and deploying high-tech skimmers that don't skim and supersuckers that don't suck. They were using some 35 boats and barges in previously serene Northwest Bay, which used to be disturbed only by an occasional fishing boat. Now the bay's abundant birds and other wildlife are buffeted by a massive, noisy 24-hour assault. Rocks and sand are gouged, dredged and rearranged, and each day's efforts result in recovery of only seven barrels of oil, probably less than that spilled by the flotilla of &quot;rescue&quot; boats -- and that doesn't even take into consideration the waste discharged by the 500 workers. The efforts are as ineffective as they are intrusive.    Similarly, a multi-million dollar operation on Perry Island, set up aboard several barges to respond to fishermen's complaints of oil-soaked kelp, has had little success. It had extracted only two barrels of oil from 25 pans of kelp in three weeks, and now sits idle because search crews can't find any more oily weed to process.    And Smith Island, which I first visited in early May, has been twice &quot;treated&quot; (Exxon no longer uses the term &quot;cleaned&quot;) but looks just the same: It's still covered by oil-soaked rocks.    Exxon, which spent almost nothing to prepare for a spill, is spending enormous sums trying to clean up. All willing local fishermen have been hired to keep them busy (and quiet) and every known or inventable device has been brought or constructed to try to remove the oil. The crude, hand-made implements seem to work the best, according to one Exxon foreman at Gold Bug Beach, as he demonstrated how a piece of screen attached to a rake handle could lift oil out where an expensive skimmer failed.    The U.S. Coast Guard, which oversees Exxon's cleanup, continues to hold Exxon to a completion date of Sept. 15 and says it will call Exxon back early next spring if necessary.    I wish it were possible to remove the oil and return Prince William Sound and the beaches of three national parks to their former pristine condition, but the truth is that the technology to accomplish that task simply doesn't exist. We should therefore stop inflicting more pain on the environment. Nature should now be given the chance to finish the cleanup job, with only occasional help from small work crews where oil surfaces or puddles.    At the same time, we should demand some benefit from this ecological tragedy. Exxon and Alyeska, which are jointly responsible, should pay for every feasible study of the spill's impact on animal, fish and landscape, and for repairs and improvements, whenever they are possible. Under tort law principles, which set monetary values for pain and suffering inflicted on individuals, let there be a generous award for the pain and suffering inflicted on Alaska's beaches and animal life. Large &quot;punitive damages&quot; should be assessed as well, to make an example of the carelessness of Exxon and Alyeska, with funds earmarked to improve fish and wildlife opportunities and for future protection. Exxon -- and its equally culpable partners at Alyeska -- must remain liable for any short-term and long-term damages that yet become apparent.    And in the meantime, let's try to avoid future spills by studying other methods of containerization. It'll cost more, but this problem has become intolerable -- as recent spills in Lousiana, Rhode Island and Delaware prove -- and will only get worse.    ----   Rep.
