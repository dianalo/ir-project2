Bush, in a speech to the Veterans of Foreign Wars convention,chided Dukakis for saying that he reflects President Reagan's viewson the Soviet Union more closely than the vice president.   He also made an impassioned defense of embattled presidentialcampaign running mate Dan Quayle, saying the Indiana senator has``been under shrill partisan attack'' over allegations that Quayle,a hawk on defense issues, used family connections to sign up withan Indiana National Guard unit at the height of the Vietnam War.   ``I salute the Vietnam Veterans here today, those who fought inthe rice paddies,'' Bush said. ``But others served too, some in theArmy Reserve and some in the National Guard, and were not sentoverseas.''   ``True, he didn't go to Vietnam but his unit wasn't sent,'' thevice president said. ``But there's another truth: he did not go toCanada, he did not burn his draft card and he damned sure didn'tburn the American flag. I'm proud to have him at my side.''   In an address frequently interrupted by applause by the warveterans, many of them wearing their garrison caps, Bush accusedDukakis of having advocated policies in the past which would haveweakened America's hand in dealing with the Kremlin.   Bush said a president must be committed to keeping U.S. forcesmodernized, saying only modernization and testing of weapons givesthe Soviets ``the incentive to negotiate real arms controlagreements.''   He said that ``I plan to negotiate strategic arms reductionswith the Soviets. ... But I will not do what my opponent hassuggested _ get rid of the MX, the Midgetman, the B-1 bomber andtwo carrier battle groups. I will not make such unilateral cuts inour defense.''   ``As veterans, you know better than anyone else the terriblecost of war,'' the Republican presidential candidate said. ``I,too, almost lost my life in one.''   ``I think it is fair to ask this morning whether my opponentunderstands this fundamental truth: that strength detersaggression. That the way to peace is through strength.''   ``Peace through strength works,'' Bush said.   The Bush campaign considered the vice president's foreign policyspeech the major Bush event of the day. Bush was traveling toSpokane, Wash., for a Republican rally there.   He used much of the Palmer House speech here to criticizeDukakis' statements on national defense policy, particularly thegovernor's recent suggestion that Reagan seeks to warm relationswith Moscow while Bush argues a harder line to placateconservatives.   ``My opponent would have you believe that he's closer to RonaldReagan on defense policy than I am,'' Bush said. ``Well, he's aboutas close to Ronald Reagan on defense as Winnie the Pooh is toRefrigerator Perry in the area of bears.'' Bush was referring inthe latter instance to William Perry, the more than 330-poundoffensive lineman for the Chicago Bears football team.   Bush said that Dukakis long supported a nuclear freeze, but saidthe governor has stepped away from that position since the Reaganadministration consummated the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces(INF) treaty with the Soviet Union, eliminating a whole class ofnuclear missiles.   If the United States had embraced the nuclear freeze movement,Bush said, ``it would have locked in Soviet superiority in a rangeof strategic areas.''   ``It would have prevented us from deploying the Pershingmissiles in Europe,'' he said. ``How else would we have convincedthe Soviets that we were serious about having them remove theirthousand SS-20 warheads at a time when we had none.''   ``In the microwave oven of the campaign, my opponent's positionon the freeze has started to melt, in belated recognition of thefact that our policies are working,'' he said.   Bush also chided Dukakis for opposing the participation byMassachusetts in construction of an emergency communications systemfor use by a president in the event of an attack.   ``Only one governor refused to have a (Ground Wave EmergencyNetwork) site in his state _ the governor of Massachusetts,'' hesaid.   Bush said that he is pleased to see reform coming about in theSoviet Union, but said the United States must not let down itsguard in dealing with the Kremlin.   ``Andrei Gromyko was right. He's (Soviet leader Mikhail S.Gorbachev) got a nice smile. He's also got iron teeth. And onemajor reason why he favors agreements now is because we're strong.''   ``We're not out of the woods yet,'' he said. ``The Soviets arenow deploying two new ICBMs, the SS-24 and SS-25. So even withperestroika, Soviet military modernization, including their ownresearch into strategic defense, has not slackened.''</TEXT></DOC>
