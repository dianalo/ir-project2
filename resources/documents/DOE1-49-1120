Segregationhas been and will continue to be useful for gene mapping, in hamsteras in other animals, and with the assignment of more genetic loci, especiallyselectable markers, the ability to manipulate animal cell systems willincrease dramatically. The level of sophistication available for geneticmanipulation should soon approach that available in lower organisms.New applications for segregation techniques are inevitable. In this reviewit was necessary to adopt an operational definition of segregation asany event leading to the reexpression of a recessive phenotype in a cellline heterozygous at the locus responsible for the phenotype. This ledus to consider a number of genetic and epigenetic mechanisms that arenot usually thought of as &quot;segregation' mechanisms. Thus, while deletionis usually regarded as a type of mutation, and gene inactivation as anepigenetic phenomenon, both can and do act to uncover recessive phenotypesin somatic cells, both in hybrid cells and in diploid cells in cultureor in vivo.</TEXT></DOC>
