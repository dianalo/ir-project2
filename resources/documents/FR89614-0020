Statutory AuthorityThe Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 (HSWA), enacted on November8, 1984, impose substantial new responsibilities on those who handle hazardouswaste. The amendments prohibit the continued land disposal of hazardouswaste beyond specified dates unless the waste meets or is treated to meetlevels established pursuant to RCRA andSection; 3004(m) <T3>or</T3> the Administrator determines that the prohibition is not requiredin order to protect human health and the environment for as long as thewastes remain hazardous (RCRA sections 3004 (d)(1), (e)(1), (f)(2), (g)(5)).Congress established a separate schedule in andSection; 3004(f) for makingdeterminations regarding the injection of dioxins and solvents and thelist of wastes specified in andSection; 3004(d)(2), termed the ``Californialist.''Wastes meeting the treatment standards set by EPA under section 3004(m)of RCRA may be land disposed. The statute requires EPA to set ``levelsor methods of treatment, if any, which substantially diminish the toxicityof the waste or substantially reduce the likelihood of migration of hazardousconstituents from the waste so that short-term and long-term threats tohuman health and the environment are minimized'' (RCRA section 3004(m)(1)).Land disposal prohibitions are effective immediately upon the statutoryor regulatory deadlines unless the Agency sets another effective date basedon the earliest date that adequate alternative treatment, recovery, ordisposal capacity which is protective of human health and the environmentwill be available (RCRA sections 3004(h)(1) and (2)). However, these effectivedate variances may not exceed 2 years beyond the otherwise applicable effectivedate. In addition, two 1-year, case-by-case extensions of the effectivedate may be granted under certain circumstances (see 53 FR 28124, July26, 1988) (RCRA section 3004(h)(3).For the purposes of the land disposal restrictions program, the statutespecifically defines land disposal to include, but not be limited to, anyplacement of hazardous waste in a landfill, surface impoundment, wastepile, injection well, land treatment facility, salt dome or salt bed formation,or underground mine or cave (RCRA section 3004(k)). The statute also setsforth a series of deadlines for Agency action.The land disposal prohibitions apply to all hazardous wastes identifiedor listed under RCRA section 3001 as of November 8, 1984, the date of enactmentof HSWA. For any hazardous waste identified or listed under RCRA section3001 after November 8, 1984, EPA is required to make land disposal restrictiondeterminations within 6 months of the date of identification or listing(RCRA section 3004(g)(4)). However, the statute does not impose an automaticprohibition on land disposal if EPA misses a deadline for any newly listedor newly identified waste.<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Section 3004(f)</ITAG>Section 3004(f) addresses the disposal by injection of solvents, dioxins,and California list wastes. Specifically, this section requires the Administratorto promulgate rules prohibiting the disposal of such wastes into wellsif it may ``reasonably be determined that such disposal may not be protectiveof human health and the environment for as long as the waste remains hazardous* * *''.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Section 3004(g) </ITAG>Section 3004(g) of RCRA applies to all methods of land disposal. It requiresthe Agency to set a schedule for making land disposal restriction decisionsfor all hazardous wastes listed in 40 CFR Part 261 under RCRA section 3001(c)as of November 8, 1984, other than the wastes referred to in sections 3004(d)and (e).Section 3004(g)(5) provides that the regulations promulgated by the Administratormust prohibit methods of land disposal except methods ``which the Administratordetermines will be protective of human health and the environment for aslong as the wastes remain hazardous * * *''.Furthermore, the section provides that, except for wastes which complywith the standards expressed in section 3004(m), a method of land disposalmay not be determined to be protective of human health and the environment,``unless, upon application by an interested person, it has been demonstratedto the Administrator, to a reasonable degree of certainty, that there willbe no migration of hazardous constituents from the disposal unit or injectionzone for as long as the wastes remain hazardous.''B. Effect on State UIC PrimacyThe land disposal restrictions are in effect in all States as a matterof federal law. However, the Agency expects that State agencies which haveprimacy for the UIC program will wish to implement Part 148, and receiveauthorization to grant ``no migration'' exemptions from land disposal restrictionsas well as case-by-case extensions under section 3004(h)(3). However, beforesuch authorization can be granted, the State would have to demonstratethat it has the authority to implement sections 3004 (f) and (g) of RCRA,and receive authorization to do so. A thorough discussion of the conditionsunder which such authorization can take place can be found in 50 FR 28728<T3>et seq.</T3>, July 15, 1985, 51 FR 40618 <T3>et seq.</T3>, Nov. 7, 1986, and 52 FR 25783 <T3>et seq.</T3>, July 8, 1987. In addition, where jurisdiction for UICand RCRA do not reside in the same State agency, EPA will require a Memorandumof Understanding between the two entities, clearly outlining responsibilityfor granting exemptions.C. Regulatory BackgroundHazardous waste disposal has been regulated through two programs: surfacedisposal through 40 CFR Parts 264, 265, and new Part 268, and undergroundinjection through the UIC Program (40 CFR Parts 144 through 147).EPA established treatment standards and effective dates for surface disposalof certain hazardous wastes on November 7, 1986 (for certain solvents anddioxins, 51 FR 40572 <T3>et seq.</T3>), July 8, 1987 (for California list wastes, 52 FR 25760),and August 17, 1988 (for certain section 3004(g) wastes, 53 FR 31138 <T3>et seq.</T3>).On July 26, 1988 (53 FR 28118 <T3>et seq.</T3>), the Agency published Part 148 which established theframework for implementing the HSWA prohibitions for injected wastes, andset effective dates for the ban against the injection of solvents and dioxins.An August 16, 1988, publication set effective dates for the ban againstthe underground injection of California list wastes as well as certainof the ``First Third'' wastes (53 FR 30908 <T3>et seq</T3>.). Today's rule was proposed on October 26, 1988 (53 FR43400 <T3>et seq.</T3>) EPA is today setting effective dates for the ban againstthe underground injection of the remaining ``First Third'' wastes for whichtreatment standards have been finalized.Often, several waste streams will share a common form of BDAT and, thus,form a treatability group. Biological treatment, for example, is BDAT forseveral waste codes. Where there is sufficient available treatment capacityin a given treatability group for all types of disposal, EPA will not grantnational capacity variances. Where there is insufficient capacity for alltypes of disposal EPA must allocate or dedicate certain waste streams tothe available capacity and may grant capacity variances for the others.The allocation decisions have the short term effect of delaying an effectiveprohibition date for certain waste streams for up to two years. At theend of that time, all waste streams will be subject to the land disposalprohibitions. In view of this short time frame and the limited resources,the Agency has not developed sophisticated analyses to apportion treatmentdemand to the limited treatment capacity.In previous rules the Agency has used a tiered hierarchy that apportionsavailable treatment capacity first to surface disposal units, then to CERCLAremedial actions and RCRA section 3004(u) corrective actions, and finallyto UIC facilities (52 FR 32450, August 27, 1987, and 53 FR 30908 <T3>et seq.</T3>, August 16, 1988). Parts of this decision rule are nota basis for today's rulemaking in light of recent regulatory actions andpolicy decisions. On February 27, 1989, the Agency amended the land disposalschedule to place in the ``Third Third'' of the schedule all multi-sourceleachate that is derived from hazardous wastes (other than dioxin-containingwastes) (54 FR 8264 <T3>et seq.</T3>). This decision effectively removes many CERCLA/RCRA cleanupwastes from consideration in the above hierarchy until May 8, 1990, asmany of these wastes are multi-source leachate.Moreover, the Agency has banned the underground injection of wastes ininstances where these wastes place little demand on available capacity.This decision is consistent with the purposes of the allocation schemesince such small volumes will not affect the availability of capacity forsurface disposal or RCRA or CERCLA cleanups. This approach is also consistentwith Congressional intent in expediently moving industry away from disposaland towards treatment.Finally, the Agency believes the hierarchy is most appropriately used insituations where large volumes of waste are competing for a limited amountof treatment capacity on a nationwide basis. Today's rule bans the undergroundinjection of a number of low-volume (less than 200,000 gallons injected/year)wastes that are injected at only a few facilities. EPA believes that theavailability of truck and rail transportation to move these wastes to treatmentfacilities, the ability of industry to provide on-site tanks for treatment,and the options for managing treatment residuals for these wastes do notlimit industry's ability to treat these relatively low volumes.<ITAG tagnum="85">II. Summary of Today's Rule_Additional First Third Scheduled Wastes</ITAG>A.Response to CommentsOnly five commenters responded to the call for public comment of today'srule. Most of them supported the determinations made in the proposal. Specificcomments were made on certain of the Agency's proposed effective datesand to the applicability of established treatment standards to injectedwastes. These concerns are addressed below.<ITAG tagnum="81">1. The Applicability of BDAT Treatment Standards to Injected Wastes</ITAG>Two commenters discussed their concerns with the Agency's approach to leachate.In particular, they were concerned that (1) leachate may be physicallyand chemically unique from process generated waste and, therefore, requireseparate regulatory treatment, and (2) the Agency has not properly accountedfor the impact on treatment capacity of banning leachate derived from givenwaste codes.In general, EPA believes these comments may have some merit, and publisheda final rule at 54 FR 8264 (February 27, 1989) which reschedules multi-sourceleachate that is derived from hazardous wastes into the ``Third Third''of the schedule described in section 3004(g)(4)(C) of RCRA. Thus, the Agencyagreed that leachate may be physically and chemically unique from processgenerated waste and, therefore, require separate regulatory treatment.The regulatory decision and rationale are described in the above <T4>Federal Register</T4> notice. The effect of that February 27 rule isthat effective dates established in today's rulemaking do not apply todisposal of most multi-source leachate. Most of the leachate describedby the commenters is multi-source and, thus, the negligible amount of singlesource leachate banned by today's rule will have a minimal effect on demandfor treatment capacity.One commenter requested that the Agency not set effective dates for theban against the underground injection of K015 nonwastewaters, as they believethe BDAT treatment level for that waste is not achievable using the treatmentstandard promulgated on August 17, 1988 (53 FR 31154). That BDAT treatmentstandard (``No Land Disposal Based on No Ash'') was rescinded for K015nonwastewaters on May 2, 1989 (54 FR 18836 et seq.; see Section (II)(B)of today's preamble). As a result, K015 nonwastewaters are under the effectof the section 3004(g) ``soft hammer''. EPA is unable to set effectivedates for a listed waste in the absence of an established treatment standard.Consequently, the Agency defers action on K015 nonwastewaters until May8, 1990, or until a treatment standard is set for this waste code, whichevercomes first.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. The Establishment of Effective Dates</ITAG>One commenter stated that EPA is failing to distinguish between methodsof land disposal in promulgating these regulations. The Agency disagreeswith this contention, noting that promulgated and proposed regulatory actionsspecifically delineate between surface and deep well disposal with regardto certain effective dates.Specifically, the Agency is apportioning available treatment capacity tosurface units before injection wells. This decision rule, which clearlydistinguishes between methods of land disposal, often results in the establishmentof different ban effective dates, based on type of disposal, within a wastecode. For example, today's rule grants a 2-year treatment capacity varianceto the 118 million gallons of dilute K016 wastes which are annually undergroundinjected. This same waste was banned from surface disposal on August 8,1988, as the available treatment capacity was adequate to handle the diluteK016 being disposed in landfills and surface impoundments.It is true that the Agency is setting the same effective date for all typesof disposal for certain wastes. Such determinations are made in the contextof the above hierarchy and in situations where the amount of availabletreatment capacity is adequate to accommodate <T3>all </T3>of the subject waste that is land disposed or, conversely,<T3>none</T3> of the waste that is land disposed. EPA believes that suchdecisions are both consistent with the intent of HSWA and protective ofhuman health and the environment.Another commenter noted that the preamble language at 53 FR 43405 seemedto ban absolutely the underground injection of the wastes listed in Table2 (i.e., ``First Third'' Wastes With Established Treatment Standards WhichCurrent Data Indicate Are Not Being Injected). It is EPA's intent to banthe underground injection of hazardous waste that do not meet the BDATtreatment standards and, while the proposed regulatory language explicitlystated this, today's preamble language has been changed to clearly indicatethis intent. These wastes may continue to be underground injected if thewastes are treated to meet the BDAT standard or if a demonstration of ``nomitigation'' and the attendant requirements of the UIC program are met.Several commenters stated that EPA's use of the term ``soft hammer'' asapplied to UIC wells was misleading or incorrect. Moreover, they arguedthat any national capacity variances for injection wells should begin onMay 8, 1990, or an earlier date which EPA may set by regulation after promulgationof a BDAT standard and a decision on the availability of national protectivetreatment or disposal capacity for that waste. EPA now agrees with thislatter position. Under section 3004(h)(2), EPA ``may establish an effectivedate different from the effective date which would otherwise apply undersubsection (d), (e), (f), or (g) * * *'' given certain findings concerningnational treatment or disposal capacity. ``Any such other effective dateshall in no event be later than 2 years after the effective date of theprohibition which would otherwise apply under subsection (d), (e), (f),or (g).'' (RCRA section 3004(h)(2))Section 3004(g)(5) requires EPA to prohibit one or more methods of landdisposal of the hazardous wastes listed in the section 3004(g)(4) schedule,except for methods of land disposal which the Administrator determineswill be protective of human health and the environment as defined by thestandards in section 3004(g)(5). The schedule in section 3004(g)(4) divideswastes into thirds.Section 3004(g)(6) describes what happens where EPA fails to promulgateeffective dates on the schedule. If EPA has not promulgated effective datesby August 8, 1988, for the ``First Third'' wastes, disposal into landfillsand surface impoundments is subject to the special restrictions in section3004(g)(6)(A). There are no statutory prohibitions for disposal of wastesunder section 3004(g) into UIC wells until May 8, 1990. <T3>See</T3> RCRA section 3004(g)(6)(C). This same framework is true forwastes in the ``Second Third'' where EPA has failed to promulgate regulatoryprohibitions by June 8, 1989.Thus, for UIC well operators, the ``effective date that would otherwiseapply'' under section 3004(g) for purposes of section 3004(h)(2) is May8, 1990, unless EPA sets an earlier effective date. Under section 3004(m)EPA may not set an earlier effective date for a waste unless the Agencyhas established a treatment standard under section 3004(m) for that waste.EPA intends to promulgate prohibitions by May 8, 1990, as it develops section3004(m) standards and makes decisions on available treatment or disposalcapacity.The policy considerations underlying section 3004(h) support this interpretation.Congress provided a maximum variance of 2 years for treatment or disposalcapacity to develop and for operations to adjust to any lack of capacitythat will exist after two years. These business decisions can only be reasonablymade after the Agency has set treatment standards for the waste and evaluatedavailable treatment and disposal capacity. Thus, the maximum national capacityvariance for the injection of dilute K016, for example, is in effect fortwo years from the effective date of this rule and not two years from August8, 1988. That August 8, 1988 date only affects restrictions on disposalof wastes to surface impoundments and landfills, not UIC wells.The effective date of the prohibition on the underground injection of diluteK016 is the only change from the proposal based on this Agency interpretation.EPA may examine the application of section 3004(g) and section 3004(h)(2)to surface disposal units in the ``Second Thirds'' final rulemaking. Seeproposal at 54 FR 1056 et seq. (January 11, 1989).One commenter believes that the Agency should defer any action on effectivedates for injection wells until May 8, 1990, arguing that EPA must firstmake site-specific determinations of protectiveness before banning undergroundinjection. RCRA section 3004(g)(5) mandates that the Agency shall prohibitland disposal of the ``First Third'' of scheduled wastes ``* * * exceptfor methods of disposal which the Administrator determines will be protectiveof human health and the environment * * *''. EPA believes this requiresthat the Agency ban such disposal <T3>unless</T3> protection is shown. The Agency is in the process of determiningwhich injection sites will be protective of human health and the environment.Until successful petitions pursuant to Part 148 have been demonstrated,EPA believes the most prudent and environmentally sound action is to banthe underground injection of wastes unable to meet the BDAT treatment standards.As a practical matter, treatment capacity variances have been granted fora number of the large volume waste streams that are currently undergroundinjected, thereby alleviating any short-term dislocation for industry.B. ``First Third'' Waste for Which EPA Has Not Set Treatment Standards,and the Relationship of Today's Final Rule to the January 11, 1989, Proposal(54 FR 1056 et seq.) and the May 2, 1989, Final Rule (54 FR 18836 et seq.)On January 11, 1989, EPA proposed treatment standards and effective datesfor certain ``First Third'', ``Second Third'', and ``Third Third'' wastes(54 <T3>FR</T3> 1056 <T3>et seq.</T3>). ``First Third'' wastes addressed in the January proposalare marked with an asterisk in Table 1 below. The wastes in Table 1 arenot prohibited from land disposal by this regulation, but may be affectedby rulemaking in the very near future.In the October 26, 1988, proposal to this rule, EPA proposed to ban theunderground injection of K004 nonwastewaters and K008 nonwastewaters. TheAgency had previously set a BDAT treatment standard of ``No Land DisposalBased on No Generation'' for these wastes (53 <T3>FR</T3> 31138 <T3>et seq.,</T3> August 17, 1988). The January 11, 1989, proposal, however,proposed to change the BDAT treatment standards for these waste codes.To fully consider these changes, EPA is deferring setting an undergroundinjection effective date in this final rule for these wastes and will makea determination concerning these wastes in the final rule to the January11, 1989, proposal.On May 2, 1989 (54<T3> FR</T3> 18836 <T3>et seq.</T3>), the Agency revised BDAT treatment standard determinationsfor the nonwastewater forms of the following ten wastes: (K004, K008, K015,K021, K025, K036, K060, K069, K083, and K100). EPA had originally set BDATfor these wastes as ``No Land Disposal'' based on either ``no generation'',``reactivity'', ``recycling'', or ``no ash'' (see <T3>FR </T3>31138 <T3>et seq.,</T3> August 17, 1988). The May 2, 1989, rule narrows the setof wastes subject to the ``No Land Disposal'' BDAT. The new subset subjectto this BDAT includes only nonwastewater forms of these wastes which aregenerated by the process described in the waste listing description anddisposed after August 17, 1988. The current BDAT treatment standards, donot, however, apply to nonwastewater forms of these wastes which are generatedin the course of treating wastewater forms of these wastes. Today's finalrule sets effective dates only for the subset of these waste forms withinthe scope of the current BDAT treatment standards. For K004 nonwastewatersand K008 nonwastewaters, the Agency is not setting effective dates forthe reasons discussed in the beginning of this section.<ITAG tagnum="75">Table 1._``First Third'' Wastes for Which no Treatment Standards HaveBeen Established</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">*F006 wastewaters_The wastewater component of treatment sludges fromelectroplating operations except from the following processes: (1) Sulfuricacid anodizing of aluminum; (2) tin plating on carbon steel; (3) zinc plating(segregated basis) on carbon steel; (4) aluminum or zinc-aluminum platingon carbon steel; (5) cleaning/stripping associated with tin, zinc and aluminumplating on carbon steel; and (6) chemical etching and milling of aluminum.(NOTE: The Agency <T3>has </T3>established a treatment standard for the nonwastewater componentof the F006 waste category.

K016Wastes categorized as K016 consist of heavy ends or distillation residuesfrom the production of certain halogenated hydrocarbons. The Treatment,Storage, Disposal, and Recovery (TSDR) Survey (Ref. 2) identified 118 milliongallons of injected, dilute (andless;1%) K016 wastes with an identified BDATtreatment standard of wastewater treatment consisting of biological treatmentfollowed by wet air oxidation. The survey also indicated that 170,000 gallonsof K016 may be injected at concentrations equal to or greater than 1%.BDAT for these K016 wastes (andCx.170;1%) would be liquid combustion ((Ref.2).The Agency has determined that there is 72 million gallons of availablecapacity for the treatment train applicable to injected, dilute K016 waste.Similarly, 246 million gallons of available capacity have been identifiedfor injected wastes utilizing liquid combustion as treatment. As indicatedearlier in the preamble, the Agency has decided to grant a 2-year variancenot from August 8, 1988, as proposed, but rather from the effective dateof this rule. EPA, therefore, is today granting a variance to dilute (andless;1%)K016, and banning its injection on June 7, 1991. The injection of concentrated(andCx.170;1%) K016, unless it meets or is treated to meet the BDAT treatmentstandards, is banned on June 7, 1989. (The determination as to whethera wastewater contains less than 1% K016 is to be made at the point of initialgeneration prior to any treatment, i.e., when the waste first meets theK016 listing description.)2. K019This waste stream is composed of heavy ends and distillation residues generatedin the production of ethylene dichloride. The TSDR Survey has identifiedonly 65,000 gallons of this relatively dilute waste that are being injected.The most appropriate treatment for this waste would be wastewater treatmentbased on biological degradation (Ref. 2). As mentioned above, the surveyshows an alternative capacity of 72 million gallons for injected wastesamenable to this type of treatment. Because the Agency has identified adequatecapacity for this particular waste stream, EPA is promulgating the effectivedate as proposed, prohibiting the underground injection of K019 wastesnot meeting the BDAT treatment standards on </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">June 7, 19893. K030This waste is generated in the production of trichloroethylene and perchloroethyleneand consists of column bottoms and heavy ends. As with K019, the injectedwaste is dilute and is best treated by wastewater treatment based on biologicaldegradation. As noted above, EPA has identified 72 million gallons of suchtreatment capacity for injected wastes. The survey shows less than 30,000gallons of this waste being injected. The Agency believes that the informationgathered from the survey shows sufficient capacity to treat this waste,and is therefore promulgating the effective date as proposed and banningthe underground injection of K030 waste, unless it meets or is treatedto meet the BDAT treatment standards, on June 7, 1989.4. K103This waste stream consists of residues from the production of analine.The TSDR Survey indicates that 31,560 gallons of K103 are being injectedeach year (Ref. 2). The Agency believes that this waste is relatively concentrated.The specified BDAT for K103 is liquid combustion, which shows an availablecapacity of 246 million gallons for injected wastes. Based on this information,the Agency is banning the underground injection of such wastes, unlessthey meet or are treated to meet the BDAT treatment standards, on </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">June 7, 1989.E. Technical CorrectionOn July 26, 1988, the Agency set effective dates for the ban against theunderground injection of solvents and dioxins. Included in the Part 148language that established these bans was language referencing andSection;268.44, the regulatory section which allows for treatability variances(andSection; 148.10(c)(4) and andSection; 148.11(b)(4)). EPA is today deletingthese two provisions, and replacing them with language that would achievethe equivalent result in andSection; 148.10(c)(1) and andSection; 148.11(b)(1)(`` * * * if the wastes meet or are treated to meet the applicable standardsspecified in Subpart D of Part 268 * * * ).The Agency is recodifying andSection; 148.14 in order to make the waste-specificeffective dates appear in chronological order. This recodification is includedto enhance clarity and does not affect the decisions made on August 16,1988, for K049-52, K062, K071, and K104 wastes, nor does it open thesedecisions for public comment.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Regulatory Requirements</ITAG>A. Regulatory Impact AnalysisExecutive Order 12291 requires EPA to assess the effect of contemplatedAgency actions during the development of regulations. Such an assessmentconsists of a quantification of the potential benefits and costs of therule, as well as a description of any beneficial or adverse effects thatcannot be quantified in monetary terms. In addition, Executive Order 12291requires that regulatory agencies prepare an analysis of the regulatoryimpact of major rules. Major rules are defined as those likely to resultin:1. An annual cost to the economy of $100 million or more; or2. A major increase in costs or prices for consumers or individual industries;or3. Significant adverse effects on competition, employment, investment,innovation or international trade.The Agency has performed an analysis of the regulation to assess the economiceffect of associated compliance costs for the ``First Third'' list wastes(Ref. 3). Total compliance costs of the entire ``First Third'' list regulations(i.e., those finalized today, those finalized on August 16, 1988, and thosefor which treatment standards have not yet been defined) are estimatedat $28.5 million, or $6.2 million annualized. Alternate treatment costsare estimated to total $25.75 million ($6.0 million annualized), and petitioncosts are estimated to be $2.75 million ($0.20 million annualized). Thesecosts indicate that this rule does not constitute a major rule under ExecutiveOrder 12291.B. Regulatory Flexibility AnalysisPursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601 <T3>et seq., </T3>whenever an agency publishes a notice of rulemaking forany proposed or final rule, it must prepare and make available for publiccomment a regulatory flexibility analysis that describes the effect ofthe rule on small entities (i.e., small businesses, small organizations,and small governmental jurisdictions). This analysis is unnecessary, however,if the agency's administrator certifies that the rule will not have significanteconomic effect on a substantial number of small entities.Owners and operators of hazardous waste injection wells are generally majorchemical, petrochemical and other manufacturing companies. The Agency isnot aware of any small entities that would be affected by this rule. Part148.1(c)(3) of the regulatory framework for this rule exempts any smallquantity generator, as defined in andSection; 261.5, from the undergroundinjection prohibitions established in that framework. The Administratorcertifies that this rule will not have significant economic effects ona substantial number of small entities. As a result of this finding EPAhas not prepared a formal Regulatory Flexibility Analysis.C. Paperwork Reduction ActThe information collection requirements in this rule have been approvedby the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the Paperwork ReductionAct, (44 U.S.C. 3501 <T3>et seq.</T3>) and have been assigned OMB control number 2040-0042.Public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimatedto average 290 hours per respondent, including time for reviewing instructions,searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the date needed,and completing and reviewing the collection of information.Send comments regarding the burden estimate or any other aspect of thiscollection of information, including suggestions for reducing this burden,to Chief, Information Policy Branch, PM-223, U.S. Environmental ProtectionAgency, 401 M St. SW., Washington, DC 20460; and to the Office of Informationand Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and Budget, Washington, DC20503, marked ``Attention: Desk Officer for EPA.''<ITAG tagnum="84">IV.
