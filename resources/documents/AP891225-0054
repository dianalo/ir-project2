Thousands ofpeople lighted candles in a plea for peace.   ``The candles we will be lighting as one symbolize the longingof the ordinary citizen for peace and tranquility and hisrepudiation of violence as an instrument of power,'' The ManilaChronicle said in a front-page editorial.   Mrs. Aquino said the Dec. 1-9 coup attempt tarnished thecountry's reputation and stalled efforts to improve the economystill suffering from 20 years of rule under former PresidentFerdinand Marcos.   ``What we need to do today is to join hands so that we canregain the momentum that we lost, so that we can heal the woundsthat were inflicted upon us,'' Mrs. Aquino said.   Marcos was ousted in a February 1986 military-civilian uprisingthat propelled Mrs. Aquino to power. Marcos died in September inexile in Hawaii.   In another statement Monday, the Central Committee of the bannedCommunist Party of the Philippines blamed the December coup attempton Mrs. Aquino's failure to solve the country's economic, socialand political problems.   The party claimed the country was drifting toward a new era ofrepression because of the growing influence of the military factionthat has quelled six coup attempts during the Aquino administration.   The December coup try was the worst, leaving at least 113 peopledead.   ``The recent upsurge of popular unrest owing to the worseningpolitical and economic crisis, the military rebellion in December,and the shameless manner in which the Aquino regime asked for U.S.succor to quell the rebellion have dramatically ... exposed itsineptitude to rule,'' the party said in a statement distributed tonews organizations.   The statement was issued to mark the 21st anniversary of theCommunist Party of the Philippines, founded Dec. 26, 1968.   Thousands of candles flickered in front of homes, businesses andmilitary camps across the politically troubled land.   The nationwide candle-lighting ceremony was organized byentertainer Danny Javier in a bid to forge national unity in thewake of the coup and amid insurgencies by Marxist and Moslem rebels.   People were urged to place one candle in front of their home foreach member of the household as a gesture of peace and nationalreconciliation. Hundreds of thousands of Filipinos also crowdedchurches in Asia's only predominately Christian country to pray forpeace.   In his Christmas message, Roman Catholic Cardinal Jaime L. Sinsaid violence had drowned out the ``song of peace and good willthat was sung by the heavenly choir over Bethlehem on that firstChristmas.''</TEXT></DOC>
