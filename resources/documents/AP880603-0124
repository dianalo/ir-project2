Barbie, 74, known as the ``Butcher of Lyon,'' was convicted July4, 1987 in the southeastern city of Lyon. He was sentenced to lifeimprisonment, the maximum possible sentence.   Defense attorneys had presented 14 separate arguments in theirappeal, but all were rejected by the Criminal Chamber of theAppeals Court, France's highest court.   The court followed the recommendation of Advocate General EmileRobert, who had said that despite two ``regrettable errors'' in thetrial _ both technical _the appeal should be rejected.   Barbie was found guilty of the roundup and deportation of FrenchJews - including 44 children _ to concentration camps in Germany.He was responsible for deporting the last convoy of 600 people toleave Lyon in August 1944.   The appeals court ruling ends five years of legal proceedingsagainst Barbie that began in February 1983, when he was expelledfrom Bolivia, where he was exiled, and brought to France.   Barbie previously had been convicted of war crimes in absentiaduring trials in 1952 and 1952 and was sentenced to death. But thestatute of limitations had run out on those sentences and he wasbrought to trial again on charges of crimes against humanity, forwhich there is no statute of limitations.   Barbie is to spend the rest of his life at Lyon's St. JosephPrison, unless he is eventually given a pardon for medical reasons.</TEXT></DOC>
