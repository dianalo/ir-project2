<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-28-0951 </DOCNO><TEXT>Intergeneric protoplast fusion between Ruminococcus albus, a cellulolytic,gram-positive, anaerobic bacterium (Pc/sup s/ Sm/sup r/ Km/sup s/), andan anaerobic recombinant, FE7 (Pc/sup r/ Sm/sup s/ Km/sup r/), havinglignin-related compound-degrading activities, was performed under strictlyanaerobic conditions to introduce cellulase genes into strain FE7. Oneof the two fusants named FE7R2, showed 45 to 47% of the {beta}-glucosidaseand cellobiosidase activities of its parent R. albus and still maintaineda level of degradation activity against dehydrodivanillin, a lignin-relatedcompound, of up to 87% of that of the parent strain FE7. To verify thatthe cellulolytic activities expressed in the fusant FE7R2 originatedfrom R. albus cellulase genes, the {beta}-glucosidase gene of R. albuswas cloned into Escherichia coli HB101 with plasmid pBR322. Cells bearingare recombinant plasmid, pRAII, produced high enzyme activities againstboth p-nitrophenyl-{beta}-D-glucoside and p-nitrophenyl-{beta}-D-cellobiosideand could degrade cellobiose to glucose. Southern blot results showedthat the cloned DNA fragment could hybridize with chromosomal DNAs ofboth R. albus and FE7R2, but did not with the chromosomal DNA of FE7,indicating that the {beta}-glucosidase gene fragment was introduced intothe chromosome of FE7R2 from R. albus via the protoplast fusion. Thefusant FE7R2 could utilize simultaneously both cellobiose and dehydrodivanillin.</TEXT></DOC>
