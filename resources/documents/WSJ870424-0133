BulkeleyStaff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 04/24/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> COMPUTERS (EDP) </IN><TEXT>   Although makers of mainframe and midrange computers showed signs of life in the first quarter, industry officials aren't ready to declare the arrival of the long-awaited turnaround.    To be sure, the picture is brighter. Companies such as International Business Machines Corp., Unisys Corp. and Wang Laboratories Inc. reported stronger-than-expected earnings in the quarter. Also, Control Data Corp. reported a profit after 10 consecutive quarters of losses. Industry shipments apparently are improving and there are indications that capital spending could pick up. Share prices of some computer makers have climbed sharply.    Industry officials and analysts, however, also note that some earnings gains aren't as strong as they appear on the surface: The introduction of new products, belt-tightening, comparisons with weak year-earlier results, and even favorable foreign-currency translations played a big role in the first-quarter renaissance.    Underscoring the spottiness of the recovery, Data General Corp. yesterday reported a sharply wider net loss on a revenue downturn.    Still, the quarterly results were a welcome break from the industry's slump, and some of the biggest surprises came from big mainframe computer makers. Earnings at NCR Corp., for example, jumped 22%, and Unisys' quarterly results exceeded its own &quot;optimistic&quot; forecasts. Demand for midrange computers &quot;and big systems in the U.S. isn't at the boom levels it used to be, but I suspect it's much better than it was maybe nine months ago,&quot; says W. Michael Blumenthal, Unisys chairman and chief executive officer.    Some of the best news came from IBM, which accounts for about 70% of the industry's earnings. While Big Blue's profit declined 23%, the drop was much less than some analysts expected. The company said a surge of mainframe sales in March helped, and cited the first encouraging signs in its business after back-to-back years of slumping profit.    &quot;If they see a pickup, it means (business) is picking up,&quot; says John C. Lewis, president of Amdahl Corp., an IBM-compatible mainframe maker whose quarterly earnings increased more than tenfold.    Even so, analysts note that the mainframe computer market is a mature industry that is unlikely to return to the days of double-digit percentage sales increases. Sales of large-scale computers from U.S. makers rose an average of 29% annually to $16.97 billion on a world-wide basis from 1981 through 1985, says International Data Corp. But the market research concern estimates sales will increase an average of only 2.8% a year through 1991. Meanwhile, the number of units sold is expected to rise 4.2% annually, reflecting a trend in the industry to offer users more power at the same or a lower price.    The midrange computer companies also have been reporting better-than-expected earnings on improved sales. However, like the mainframe officials, they are reluctant to proclaim a turnaround. For example, Prime Computer Inc. remains cautious despite an unexpectedly large 28% earnings increase on a 13% revenue gain. &quot;Given the general economic uncertainty, we will continue to manage our expenses carefully,&quot; Prime Computer President Joe M. Henson says.    In a depressed capital-spending environment, midrange computer companies' growth -- while picking up -- remains far below past levels. &quot;Earnings are coming from continued belt-tightening and new products,&quot; says Craig Symons, a Gartner Group Inc. analyst. &quot;Revenue gains haven't been back to the 20%-plus form these companies used to show.&quot;    Most companies have scaled back their operations so much that even small sales gains turn into better-than-expected earnings. Take Wang Laboratories: The maker of office automation systems surprised analysts -- and many insiders -- by reporting a small profit for its third quarter ended March 31. It had cut costs during the quarter, and when revenue grew a better-than-expected 8.8%, a profit resulted.    The earnings surprises have given many computer stocks a boost. Standard andamp; Poor's Corp.'s index of computer and business equipment stocks slightly outperformed the market for the week ended April 22, the latest period available. The stock price of the technology segment rose 2.8%, while the Sandamp;P 500 rose 1%. Two particularly strong gainers were Unisys and Prime Computer, whose shares jumped 13% during the same period.    As with IBM, other computer concerns reported sharply stronger March sales. The surge was partly attributed to customers who had been holding back to evaluate new models and enhancements in IBM's Sierra mainframe line. In addition, many users delayed purchases until March to try to get a better sense of the economic outlook, says Robert Gilbertson, chairman and chief executive of Data Switch Corp., a maker of switching devices for mainframe computers.    Large companies &quot;are close to capacity on mainframe power,&quot; Mr. Gilbertson adds, and &quot;a lot of our customers have been nursing their mainframes for the last 18 months or so.&quot;    There are more encouraging signs for the industry. &quot;There are too many positive signals around here to ignore them,&quot; says Ulric Weil, an analyst associated with Gartner Group.    For example, in a survey of 1,000 large makers the U.S. Conference Board said companies expect to boost capital spending 10% this year. The industry-supported, nonprofit economic research concern has said that most of the spending &quot;will be aimed at improving efficiency,&quot; which bodes well for computer makers. Also, the year-to-year decline in computer shipments has apparently abated, says Steven Milunovich, a First Boston Corp. analyst. From December through February, shipments were flat, compared with a 16% decline in the same period a year ago, he says.    Mainframe makers also hope to increase sales later this year as customers link desktop personal computers with mainframes, says George Olson, a vice president with Honeywell Bull Inc. Such hookups, he says, will require more computing power.    &quot;It's akin to telephone sales,&quot; Mr. Olson says. &quot;The more you sell, the bigger the switch is needed at the ATandamp;T office.&quot;    Meanwhile, to grow in the midrange market, broad-based companies must take business from competitors, rather than simply ride a booming market.    That seems to be the case for Digital Equipment Corp., which has been reporting surging earnings and sales for more than a year. Digital, for example, has taken some business away from IBM, selling to insurance and financial services concerns that once were IBM preserves. Digital also is taking business from its smaller competitors in the midrange field, such as Wang and Data General.    On the other hand, smaller companies with narrow markets are seeing expanding demand without having to engage in tough market-share battles. These include Alliant Computer Systems Corp. and Convex Computers Inc., which make minisupercomputers for scientists and engineers, says Charles Casale, a Yankee Group analyst.    Tandem Computers Inc. has become a stock market favorite with a string of strong quarters, though analysts were disappointed last week when it reported an 81% earnings increase on 37% revenue growth to $242.4 million. Tandem makes computers that can handle a constant stream of transactions without breaking down -- bank teller machines, for example.    &quot;Specialty companies making machines with more limited markets are enjoying very good business,&quot; Mr. Casale says. </TEXT></DOC>
