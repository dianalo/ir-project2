Chipello (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> TAXES </CO><IN> BNK TNM </IN><DATELINE> BOSTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   The state House of Representatives and Senate joint banking committee approved a bill that would open Massachusetts to full interstate banking from Jan. 1, 1990.    The proposed law would enable banks from states with reciprocal provisions to enter Massachusetts, and would permit Massachusetts banks to buy into those states. Massachusetts and other New England states began to experiment with interstate banking in 1985, but only within New England.    Rep. Thomas M. Finneran and Sen. John P. Burke, chairmen of the committee, declared in a joint statement that &quot;Massachusetts banks are now strong enough to be competitive with anyone. Prolonging regional protectionism would only cost consumers money.&quot;    Messrs. Finneran and Burke said they are optimistic the bill, which next goes to the House Committee of Ways and Means, will be sent to Gov. Michael Dukakis before the Legislature recesses in July. But some elements of the measure could stir controversy.    Efforts to pass interstate bills in the past two years ran aground, partly because of concern that big New York banks would scoop up the region's most attractive franchises. A flurry of mergers during that period, however has created some of the larger and stronger regional banking companies in the country, and most banks now support, in principle, a move to broader interstate banking.    Still, the booming Massachusetts economy has made it one of the nation's premier banking markets in recent years, and some of the state's midsized institutions are bound to attract interest. Stock prices of some Boston-area banks rose yesterday, apparently helped by anticipation of the interstate legislation.    Several bankers said yesterday, however, that they would need time to study the specifics of the committee's bill before endorsing it.    A spokesman for the Massachusetts Bankers Association noted that the proposal unveiled yesterday includes some unexpected features -- in particular, a plan to restructure the state fund that insures savings banks deposits not covered by federal insurance. That plan includes the diversion of $40 million of the $200 million fund for state environmental projects. &quot;This will cause quite a reaction&quot; within the industry, the association spokesman predicted.    Questions also remain about tax treatment, a major issue of concern. Most of the banks that do support national interstate banking insist that such legislation be accompanied by a reduction of the state's income tax for banks. At around 12%, the rate is higher than for other corporations and, according to the state bankers association, higher than for banks in any other state.    The legislative committee noted the banks' &quot;understandable concern over this inequitable treatment; and Messrs. Finneran and Burke said they have called on the state Department of Revenue to study the issue and report to the Legislature within 90 days after the bill's passage. While any proposals to lower tax rates are likely to encounter resistance, Mr. Finneran said, that resistance could be lowered if the banks help devise programs to deal with such social issues as a shortage of affordable housing.    The committee also proposed reducing the extent of coverage afforded by the state deposit insurance fund. Under the plan, the fund, which covers amounts in excess of the $100,000 limit on federal insurance, would no longer cover corporate deposits or out-of-state, brokered deposits. The committee estimates that would enable shrinking the fund's size from $200 million to $60 million. It proposes returning $100 million to member banks and turning over about $40 million to the state for toxic-waste cleanups and other environmental programs. </TEXT></DOC>
