It has a wide,and apparently ever-increasing, range of applications in clinical practiceand the purpose of this book is to provide a comprehensive review ofthe use of bone scanning. In addition, important topics of current interest,such as single photon emission computed tomography, quantitation of boneuptake of diphosphonate and bone mineral measurements by photon absorptiometry,are included. The emphasis is on the clinical use of bone scanning.</TEXT></DOC>
