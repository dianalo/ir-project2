The protest on Thursday came after Attorney General CarlosVillalaz announced that customs agents had seized theU.S.-registered ship Ambassador and its cargo. Panama said itdiscovered a 120mm cannon and other war materiel inside sealedcontainers on board the vessel.   The cargo, identified on the ship's manifest as ``generalmerchandise,'' was destined for the Southern Command, Villalaz tolda news conference in this Atlantic port city located 50 miles northof Panama City.   He said the attempted delivery of war materiel in the civilianport violated the 1977 Panama Canal Treaties.   The Southern Command is based in the former Canal Zone andoversees all U.S. military operations in Latin America.   Villalaz said that for security reasons, the governmentprohibits ships from carrying arms into Las Minas port, 10 mileseast of Colon. A refinery based in Las Minas processes crude oilimports for Panamanian consumption.   The Ambassador, which arrived Wednesday from Fort Lauderdale,Fla., and its cargo were seized on Thursday.   A Southern Command spokesman, speaking on condition ofanonymity, said the shipment was legal under the treaties and thatthe Southern Command had ``vigorously protested'' the incident.   He said a U.S. military officer was denied access to the cargoshipment.   ``They illegally seized equipment belonging to the United StatesArmy,'' the spokesman said, adding it was the first time Panama hadconfiscated U.S. military equipment.   Villalaz said customs agents discovered the cannon and twofive-ton troop transport vehicles on board the Ambassador. Customsofficials suspected that boxes yet to be opened contained munitionsand arms, he said.   Villalaz suggested the arms could have been used by opponents ofthe government, which is controlled by Defense Forces commanderGen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.   Authorities arrested 26 opposition activists last week andaccused them of involvement in a U.S.-sponsored subversion plan.The U.S. Embassy denied the charge.   The Reagan administration has imposed economic sanctions againstPanama in a bid to force the ouster of Noriega, who is under U.S.indictment on drug trafficking charges.   The Southern Command spokesman refused to identify the equipmenton board the Ambassador but said the 120mm cannon was ``totallyuseless and sent to Panama to be used in a testing center, wherethe effects of tropical conditions on munitions storage aretested.''   Under the canal treaties, the United States is to turn overcontrol of the waterway to Panama on Dec. 31, 1999.  </TEXT></DOC>
