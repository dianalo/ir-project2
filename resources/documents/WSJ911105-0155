The new systems, called TAT-10 and TAT-11, will go intoservice in 1992 and 1993, respectively, and each will be ableto carry 80,000 telephone conversations simultaneously, ATandamp;Tsaid.</LP><TEXT>   TAT-10, which will cost about $300 million, will directlylink the U.S. with Germany and the Netherlands and will beowned by 35 international carriers, ATandamp;T said. TAT-11 willjoin the U.S. with the U.K. and France; its $280 million costwill be borne by 25 carriers, ATandamp;T said.   ATandamp;T and Germany's Deutsche Bundespost are TAT-10'slargest owners, with 20% each. TAT-11 is 31.6% owned by ATandamp;T,with Britain's Mercury Communications PLC, the next largestholder at 20.9%. Other U.S. investors in the cable projectsinclude Washington-based MCI Communications Corp.; US SprintCommunications Co., a unit of United Telecommunications Inc.,Westwood, Kan., and TRT/FTC Communications Inc., Washington,which is owned by Britain's Cable andamp; Wireless PLC.   ATandamp;T will supply the fiber-optic cable and electronictransmission systems for TAT-10, according to CharlesSchmitz, ATandamp;T district manager for facility planning andagreements. TAT-11 equipment bidders are ATandamp;T (cable andelectronics); Submarcom, a French group comprising Alcateland Cables de Lyons (cable and electronics), and StandardTelephones andamp; Cables, a unit of Canada's Northern Telecom Ltd.(cable), he said. While TAT-10 supply contracts have alreadybeen issued, TAT-11's contracts have yet to be signed, hesaid.   The two systems carry the same capacity and use the samegear as the TAT-9 and trans-Pacific TPC-4 cable systems, thecompany said. These cables are digital fiber-optic systemscapable of transmitting voice and data signals at 560 millionbits per second. TAT-9, which links the U.S. and Canada withthe U.K., France and Spain, is scheduled to begin operatingin February, ATandamp;T said. TPC-4 is expected to begin service inOctober 1992.   ---   Corrections andamp; Amplifications                                                                                                          CABLE andamp; WIRELESS PLC is still awaiting FederalCommunications Commission clearance on its plan to purchaseTRT/FTC Communications Inc., Washington.
