Noriega was a rising power in Panama in 1968. He had just helpedGen. Omar Torrijos become Panama's president in a coup and wasrewarded with the job of military intelligence chief.   The now-retired agents were quoted as saying they obtained theirfirst hard evidence linking Noriega to drug smuggling in 1970, whena group of Panamanians was arrested trying to bring a boatload ofmarijuana into Miami. The captain had an address book listingNoriega's name and telephone number along with those of well-knownLatin American drug traffickers.   John Bacon, then chief of the bureau's Latin Americanintelligence division, said the captain told agents he had pickedup the drug cargo in Panama and paid Noriega a cut of the profits.   Less than a year later, the agents learned that Noriega hadarranged through Joaquim Him Gonzales, chief air traffic controllerat the Panama City airport, to smuggle heroin onto planes fromPanama City to South Florida.   Noriega's cut, they said, was $100,000 a shipment, with 90- to150-pound shipments leaving Panama City daily.   Agents arrested Gonzales in February 1971 and said they wereready to pounce next on Noriega, until the State Department becameinvolved.   The agents were quoted as saying that Gonzales' arrest hadangered U.S. Ambassador Robert Sayre.   ``We were open about what we were doing (in Panama),'' Stricklersaid, but the agents say they didn't want to tell Sayre in advancethat they intended to arrest Gonzales. They said they feared hemight not keep quiet because he was more concerned aboutmaintaining friendly relations with Torrijos and Noriega duringnegotiations to seal a new canal treaty and solve the issue ofCanal Zone sovereignty.   They lured Gonzales into the Canal Zone with an invitation toplay in a softball game.   After Gonzales' arrest, ``Sayre wanted to know everything wewere doing all the time,'' Strickler said.   He also ordered the agents that he felt were most responsiblefor the Gonzales arrest to leave Panama, the agents said.   ``State Department officials in Panama began reviewing allbureau confidential cables on Noriega and Torrijos and refused tosend some of them on because they felt it would upset thegovernment,'' Strickler said.   Gonzales' arrest had outraged and unnerved Torrijos so much thatthe State Department had to beg for the general's forgiveness, theagents say.   ``As Noriega became more known, nothing we said made animpression on the State (Department),'' Strickler said.   Some current and former administration and State Departmentofficials deny ignoring Noriega's drug smuggling or interferingwith agents who tried to stop him. They say they were never shownhard evidence of Noriega's involvement in drugs. Others, however,back up the agents.   The bureau become the Drug Enforcement Administration in 1973.</TEXT></DOC>
