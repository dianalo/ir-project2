<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-04-0802 </DOCNO><TEXT>The results of experimental investigations of the short-range order innoncrystalline (amorphous) solids are reviewed. The data from both directmethods of structural analysis (diffraction of x rays, electrons, andneutrons, EXAFS measurements), as well as indirect spectroscopic methods(Raman scattering, NMR, NQR, and EPR), are examined. The magnitudes ofthe rms deviations of the short-range order parameters, characterizingthe degree of continuum disordering, inherent to the amorphous stateof matter, are presented. Analysis of the experimental results leadsto the conclusion that the structure of noncrystalline solids is highlyordered at the atomic level.</TEXT></DOC>
