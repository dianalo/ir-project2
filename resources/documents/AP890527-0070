The attack occurred in a bushy area near the communal settlementof Hamadiya, 50 miles northeast of Jerusalem, the military commandsaid.   An army patrol, ``encountered light weapons fire from east ofthe fence'' between Israel and Jordan, and returned fire, thecommand said.   Soldiers searched the area on the Jordanian side of the borderand found the body of a guerrilla dressed in a military-typeuniform and armed with a U.S.-made M-16 assault rifle, an armyspokesman said.   But in an official broadcast, Jordan said the man may have beena Jordanian Army soldier, Issa Mahmoud Ahmad, who earlierdisappeared from a border observation post.   It was the third infiltration or attack from Jordan since May1988.   ``We have the impression that this is not a new step or a newdirection,'' Maj. Gen. Amram Mitzna, the head of the Israeli army'scentral command, told Israel radio. ``We see that the Jordaniansare making every effort and use all means to keep this bordersecure and closed.''   In previous cases, Mitzna said, guerrillas sneaked by Jordanianpatrols. ``This case is still unclear. We don't know who this manis, where he left from, who sent him and how he came here.''   The last raid across the Jordanian border was on March 17 whentwo guerrillas ambushed an Israeli frontier patrol, killing onesoldier and wounding another before escaping back to Jordan.   The Fatah-Uprising group, a Syrian-backed faction of thePalestine Liberation Organization led by Col. Said Mousa, claimedresponsibility for the attack.   Three Arab guerrillas infiltrated Israel from Jordan on May 17,1988, and one was killed in a firefight with Israeli troops. Theothers escaped.</TEXT></DOC>
