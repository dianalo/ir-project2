Roh ordered the amnesty involving 2,015 ``politically motivatedoffenders'' as part of efforts to defuse nationwide furor overdemands for the punishment of former president Chun Doo-hwan forhuman rights abuses and corruption under his authoritarian regime.   In addition to the releases, the Justice Ministry said the civilrights of 1,581 dissidents had been restored, the sentences of 92people reduced and 61 fugitive radical students dropped from policewanted lists.   Dissident leaders charged that 300 political prisoners remainedin jail and dismissed the amnesty as a government trick toperpetuate its control.   Released prisoners and supporters called for Roh's fall and theexpulsion of the 42,000 U.S. troops based in the country.   Park Suk-yook, a dissident freed from a prison in the southerncity of Kwangju, told supporters, ``All prisoners of conscience mustbe freed to realize democracy ... I will fight, together with mycomrades, until the military dictatorship is terminated in thisland.''   ``Drive out the Yankees,'' dozens of protesters chanted inChongju south of Seoul as they greeted Moon Boo-shik, who wasserving a 20-year sentence for his part in a 1982 attack on a U.S.cultural center in the southern port of Pusan.   Kim Hyun-jang, also involved in the Pusan attack, ridiculed theamnesty. ``I am sorry to be released when many comrades are stillheld in prison,'' he said.   One person died and three others were injured when the Pusancenter was set on fire in an anti-U.S. protest. Dissidents contendWashington supports authoritarian rule in South Korea and demand thewithdrawal of U.S. forces based in the country under a defensetreaty.   A government spokesman, who declined to be named, warned thereleased dissidents not to engage in violent anti-governmentprotests.   ``The government will deal sternly with radicals' future actionswhich are seen as defying the nation's free democratic system,'' hesaid.   Justice Ministry officials said 224 ``anti-state criminals''remained in jail, but said nearly all were communist North Koreanspies.   Roh appealed to the nation last month to forgive Chun andpromised to free political prisoners as part of a series of measuresto wipe out vestiges of the Chun government.   Many South Koreans still identify Roh with his predecessor,although the new government has dismantled Chun's authoritariancontrols and helped introduce widespread political reforms.   Chun, a former general who took power with military backing in1980, went into voluntary internal exile last month afterapologizing to the nation for abuses under his rule.   The opposition parties are demanding Chun appear before aNational Assembly probe before the question of the pardon proposedby Roh is addressed. Roh wants Chun pardoned without further action.   Dissidents and some mainline opposition leaders hope to usecontroversy over Chun to generate opposition to Roh, a formergeneral who won presidential elections last December. Dissidentshave little public support, but many Koreans are angry about Chunand want some kind of action.   Prime Minister Kang Young-hoon said in a statement Tuesday theamnesty ``is aimed at completely resolving the political controversythat has been going on for months over the question of politicallymotivated offenders.''   Among those having his civil rights restored was Kim Tae-kun, aleading dissident who won the Robert Kennedy Human Rights Award.Kim, released in June, drew five years in 1986 on charges ofattempting to overthrow the government and spreading pro-NorthKorean propaganda.   Kim claims he was forced to make a false confession under torture.</TEXT></DOC>
