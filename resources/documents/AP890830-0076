He was 79.   The prominent conservationist suffered a heart attack Tuesdaywhile visiting the western England city of Bristol and died there,said the Wildlife and Wetlands Trust at Slimbridge on the SevernRiver estuary where Scott lived.   Scott, who was a founder of the World Wildlife Fund, would havebeen 80 on Sept. 14.   He was two years old when his father, Capt. Robert Falcon Scott,died in the Antarctic snows in 1912 after being beaten to the SouthPole by a Norwegian, Roald Amundsen.   Capt. Scott left a note to his wife in his hut saying, ``Make theboy interested in natural history; it is better than games .. . Makehim a strenuous man.''   His son said in later life that he felt having a hero for afather meant he had to do well in different fields by his ownunaided effort.   After studying art in Munich and London, Scott became acelebrated bird artist, exhibiting in London and New York. The royalfamily owns some of his paintings.   He was an Olympic bronze medalist yachtsman in 1936 and threetimes decorated commander of destroyers and gunboats in World WarII, when he also designed the camouflage adopted by the BritishAdmiralty for all ships on duty in the Atlantic Ocean.   He was a champion glider pilot, America's Cup helmsman in 1964and the first Briton to be knighted, in 1973, for services toconservation. He wrote 18 books on natural history, illustrated 20books by other authors and published three volumes of travel diariesand an autobiography, ``The Eye of the Wind,'' in 1961.   Scott was prominent in the movement to save whales, describingthe whaling nations as ``international hooligans.''   In 1949, he explored the unmapped Perry River area of theCanadian Arctic and led expeditions of naturalists to Iceland,Australasia, the Galapagos and Seychelles Islands and three times tothe Antarctic.   Scott said he founded his wildfowl trust in 1946 as a haven formigrating geese and other water birds after shooting a goose andseeing it slowly die.   ``I thought I wouldn't do that to my worst enemy so why should Ido it to a goose,'' he recalled.   In 1961, Scott was one of the founders of the World WildlifeFund, now known as the World Wide Fund for Nature, and designed itspanda logo.   ``The fact that the fund has gone from strength to strength andbecome the largest voluntary conservation organization in the worldis a tribute to Sir Peter's vision, energy and determination,'' saidGeorge Medley, director of the fund's British arm.   In February, Scott was named Conservationist of the Year by theU.S. magazine, Wildlife Art News.   In May he was presented with the Conservation Medal of theNational Zoological Park in Washington, D.C.   Scott is survived by his wife, Philippa Talbot-Ponsonby, andtheir son and daugther, and by a daughter from a previous marriage.</TEXT></DOC>
