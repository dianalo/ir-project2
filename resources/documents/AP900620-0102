Namibia approaches the U.N.-sponsored donors' conference in NewYork as a bad candidate for international aid, not because it istoo poor but because, on the surface, it appears rich.   Grants, not loans, will be the theme of Namibia's plea.President Sam Nujoma and other government officials want toredirect social spending toward the vast majority of poor peoplewithout borrowing huge amounts of foreign money.   They want one-time grants to use as start-up funds forself-generated development of their country, which becameindependent from South Africa on March 21.   With only 1.3 million people in a country almost as large aswestern Europe, Namibia has an annual per capita income of $1,200,making it the richest country in sub-Saharan Africa.   But the majority of Namibia's people live in poverty, and 5percent _ the whites _ have most of the wealth.   Namibia has the highest number of tarred roads per capita in theworld, and the best ratio of hospital beds per person in Africa.Water is clean in most places, the telephones work, and its publicadministration is on par with the developed world.   It's constitution had been praised by leaders throughout theworld as one of the most democratic documents ever devised, and itsgovernment and people are _ at least for the present _ committed toa multi-party democracy and a mixed economy.   The United Nations, which shepherded Namibia to independence bysupervising its elections last year, and the World Bank have saidthe fledgling nation has the potential to become a model for peaceand prosperity in Africa.   But illiteracy stands at 60 percent. Housing is scares, teachersare underqualified, and aside from commercial farmland, the ruralareas are virtually undeveloped.   Thirty percent of the population is unemployed. Armedex-soldiers of the former colonial army and the guerrilla forces ofthe now-ruling party are posing an increasing threat to civil order.   The new government says it is under severe pressure to ``addressthe equity problem at an acceptable pace to the hithertodisenfranchised and neglected majority without jeopardizinggrowth'' or further neglecting its highly developed infrastructure.   Independence itself has brought new expenditures, such as UnitedNations membership fees, embassies and the creation of a centralbank and new currency by 1992.   The government also faces a severe inherited fiscal problem. Toserve its white constituency, the South African government createdan excessively overstaffed public administration. It financed thewage bill and public debt through higher taxes. That was at theexpense of public investment, which has steadily shrunk to minimallevels over the past decade and is partly responsible for thecurrent depressed economy.   The Namibian government, together with the World Bank and theUnited Nations Development Program, have devised a one-timeinvestment program consisting of 83 individual priority projectstotalling $400 million to set the stage for future self-sustaineddevelopment.   The World Bank has recommended that most of the aid be given asdirect grants, so as not to give the new country a foreign debtproblem at its birth.   But direct grants are normally allocated only to the world'sleast developed nations, and so far, Namibia has failed to qualifyas one of those.</TEXT></DOC>
