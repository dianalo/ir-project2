Large discrepancieswere found between the experimentally measured and theoretically computedvalues. The discrepancies are due to inaccuracies in the computationsof the electron collision strengths from the 2s{sup 2} and 2s2p levelsto the 2s3p levels, using either the R-matrix method or the distorted-waveapproximation.</TEXT></DOC>
