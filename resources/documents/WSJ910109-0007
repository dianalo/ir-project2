The decision is the final chapter in a case under Sudan'sIslamic &quot;sharia&quot; laws, which required the parents of the deadBritons to decide what penalty the terrorists should receive.They had a choice of demanding the death penalty, to requirethe terrorists to pay compensatory money or to allow them tobe freed. The parents' dilemma was the subject of a Page Onearticle in this newspaper a year ago.</LP><TEXT>   Two of the aid workers, Chris and Clare Rolfe, wereQuakers, a religion that has sought the abolition of thedeath penalty for more than 300 years. They were dining in arestaurant when a Palestinian hurled a bag of explosives intothe room. The other British victim, a 32-year-old schoolteacher named Sally Rockett, also believed in non-violence.   The parents felt that a death penalty would contradicttheir children's beliefs. But they did ask the court toimpose stiff prison terms, as the Palestinians had expressedjubilation over the killings in court and seemed likely topursue terrorism again.   A Sudanese judge imposed prison terms of less than threeyears, which the Palestinians already have served and saidthat the political nature of the crime warranted lightpunishment.   Britain's Foreign Office condemned Sudan for freeing thefive men, stating that &quot;this might encourage others to commitsimilar offenses particularly at this time.&quot; A StateDepartment spokesman said that the release of the fiveIraq-aligned terrorists was &quot;grossly premature.&quot;   Sudan released the terrorists, followers of Abu Nibal,after they served less than three years in prison.</TEXT></DOC>
