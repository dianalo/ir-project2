The regulations cover the fullrange of procedural requirements for civil enforcement actions initiatedby NSF against those who contravene the mandates of the Antarctic ConservationAct. Subjects covered include, but are not limited to, complaint procedures,notice and opportunity for response, pre-hearing activities and motionpractice, adjudicatory hearing procedures, standards of proof, penaltyassessments, permit revocations, settlement, and appeal.

Telephone: (202) 357-9435.(This is not a toll-free number.)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>The Director of the National ScienceFoundation is responsible for enforcing various conservation and environmentalprotection provisions in the Antarctic Conservation Act of 1978, 16 U.S.C.Sections 2401 et seq. That statute prohibits certain acts by United Statescitizens in the Antarctic, such as killing, trapping, harming, or harassingprotected animal species, or discharging pollutants, without a valid NSFpermit. Violators of the Act are subject to civil penalty actions initiatedby NSF and to possible criminal proceedings as well. Until recently, few violations of the Act occurred, due to the remotenessof the Antarctic region and the relatively small number of scientists andvisitors there. NSF informally handled these instances of non-compliance.The past five years have witnessed a dramatic rise in tourism in the Antarctic,expanded scientific research throughout the Continent, and increased operationalactivity at United States stations. As a result, NSF is establishing formalenforcement and hearing procedures designed to insure the fair and efficienthandling of administrative complaints that charge individuals with violationsof the Act. Effective handling of administrative cases will deter environmentaland conservation violations, preserve opportunities for scientific research,and demonstrate the Foundation's continuing commitment to its environmentalobligations and to international leadership in the Antarctic community.<ITAG tagnum="84">Analysis of Comments </ITAG>NSF published proposed regulations in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on November 8, 1988 (53 FR 45199) and requestedpublic comment. The comment period ended on January 2, 1989. NSF receivedcomments from the United States Environmental Protection Agency which gaveunqualified support for this regulatory effort. No other comments werereceived. However, before the proposed regulations were formulated, NSFconducted a public hearing to aid the Foundation in its deliberations concerningthe scope of the hearing and enforcement regulations and possible Antarctictourism guidelines. Members of the public, scientists who perform researchin the Antarctic, naturalists, environmentalists, lawyers, and representativesof the tourism industry attended the public hearing and commented for therecord. Those comments were considered in drafting the regulations beforethey were published as a proposed rule in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>. Since the only public comment on the proposedrule did not suggest any changes or revisions, these regulations are beingpublished without modification as a final rule. One additional sentenceat 45 CFR 670.52(i), however, has been added. <ITAG tagnum="84">Determinations </ITAG>I have determined that this is not a major rule as defined under section1(b) of E.O. 12291, Federal Regulation. I also certify that this regulation will not have a significant economicimpact on a substantial number of small entities because the rules primarilyaffect the internal procedures of a Federal Agency. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 45 CFR Part 670 </ITAG>Administrative practice and procedure, Conservation of Antarctic animalsand plants, Enforcement and hearing procedures.For the reasons set out in the preamble, the National Science Foundationhereby amends Part 670 of Title 45, Subtitle B, Chapter VI of the Codeof Federal Regulations by adding Subpart K as set forth below.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: January 23, 1989.   </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Robert M.
