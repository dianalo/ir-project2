(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A streamlined Hospital Corporation ofAmerica will be just the right size, Chairman Thomas Frist Jr. says.   Shareholders voted Wednesday to sell HCA, the nation's largesthospital management company, to a management-led group headed byFrist in a $5 billion leveraged buyout.   One of the first orders of business is selling off threesubsidiaries to repay a $1.3 billion short-term loan that will helpfinance the buyout and clear the way for HCA's managers to run thehospitals in the United States, Frist said.   HCA owns 79 general hospitals and 52 psychiatric hospitals inthis country and an additional 25 around the world. It manages 191more U.S. hospitals and two in other countries, according to thecompany's 1988 annual report.   ``It's very streamlined today, and I'm involved in the day-to-dayoperations,'' Frist said during a news conference after theshareholders meeting.   He said the new company _ TF Investments, which becameHCA-Hospital Corporation of America on Wednesday _ has no plans tosell its general hospitals.   ``If you'd ask me what it'd look like one year from today ... wehave approximately 80 today. I'd be quite surprised if we didn'thave 80 then. Maybe add one and sell one,'' he said.   Frist said managing 70 to 80 hospitals is ``ideal.''   ``Basically, we're more focused,'' he said.   Frist said he wants to sell the three subsidiaries _ HCAPsychiatric Co., HCA Management Co. and HCA International _ asintact units rather than breaking apart their assets.   ``The idea is that we can now hopefully create three othercompanies that will stand on their own,'' he said.   The new company is paying $51 a share for the more than 71million outstanding shares of HCA stock, making the total purchaseprice $3.6 billion. Including debt, the deal amounts to more than $5billion, HCA spokesman Victor Campbell said.   In a leveraged buyout, the assets of the company are used ascollateral to borrow the money needed to purchase the company. Sucha transaction usually increases a company's debt substantially.   Taking the company private ``does permit us to be more long-termoriented, not quarter-to-quarter,'' Frist said.   ``We can run things differently. There's no plans for layoffs orto squeeze this company down. ... It was the right thing to do atthis time in our history.''</TEXT></DOC>
