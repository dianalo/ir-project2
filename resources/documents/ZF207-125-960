 The US is seen as a better market for opticaldisks that hold many gigabytes of storage because of thiscountry's un-satiable demand for storage space.andP;  Few of today'sgeneration of optical disks are yet integrated into personalcomputers.andP;  Prices for the disks are not likely to come down untilthey are produced in mass volumes, and that is unlikely to happenuntil optical storage systems become integrated into a standardPC.andM;</SUMMARY><DESCRIPT>Topic:     Optical disksErasable optical memoryJapanTechnologyMarketing Strategy.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Galloping Gigabytes!andM;Last fall in San Francisco, when Steve Jobs dazzled the PC industry with hisNeXT computer, he had an almost-silent partner: the Japanese electronicsindustry.andM;One of the NeXT's most impressive features is its high-capacity, erasable,rewritable magneto-optical disk drive, supplied by Japan's Canon.andM;Canon isn't the only Japanese company with the technology to store billionsof bytes in a personal computer.andP;  Sony has already started shipping itsmagneto-optical drive, and others--including Ricoh, Fujitsu, Hitachi,Matsushita, Pioneer, and Toshiba--are poised to follow.andP;  American companiessuch as Kodak and 3M have also been active in the field.andM;Japan's interest in computer optical storage came almost as an afterthought.andO;In the 1970s, Japanese companies targeted optical technology as the next hotmedium for delivering consumer entertainment.andP;  Now that CDs are commonplace,they're using their experience in optical technology to spin off PC products.andM;Big, Slow, and ExpensiveandM;Despite their enormous storage capacity--650MB versus the 100MB typical ofhigh-end magnetic hard disks--optical disk drives are still relatively slowand expensive.andP;  The first-generation magneto-optical disk drives cost $4,000to $6,000 each, compared with $500 to $2,000 for conventional hard drives.andO;And optical disk data access times are nearly double the access times of goodmagnetic disks.andM;Speed and cost concerns will limit initial applications.andP;  Optical drivesshould show up in high-powered graphics workstations for engineering andpublishing applications and as secondary storage media for PC networks.andP;  Butthat won't create enough volume to kick mass production into high gear--theonly way to bring prices for magneto-optical drives into line with those formagnetic drives.andM;Several Japanese makers say they are looking to U.S.andP;  companies to do forthem what NeXT is doing for Canon--devising uses for the new drives.andP;  Opticaldrive makers recognize that despite Japanese manufacturing excellence, theUnited States still leads in almost every area of creative development.andP;  Inaddition, venture capital for development companies is much easier to come byin the United States than in Japan.andM;The U.S.andP;  market may also be better suited to accommodate the new opticalstorage technology.andP;  The United States' decentralized educational systemleaves more room for independent instituitions to take a flier on a $12,000piece of new storage technology.andP;  And America's preoccupation with quarterlyresults can actually encourage companies to quickly embrace new technology.andM;These American advantages are crucial.andP;  Without new applications and newmarkets, optical drives will languish in specialized niches.andP;  &quot;We're at themercy of the market,&quot; says Sony spokesman Stephen Burke.andM;All optical drives for PCs announced to date use 5-1/4-inch magneto-opticaldisks that look like digital music CDs.andP;  The disks are packed in removablecartridges resembling the plastic cases for 3-1/2-inch magnetic floppies.andP;  Ifone 650MB disk--which is capable of containing the equivalent of 260,000typewritten pages--is not enough for your needs, you can pop out one disk andpop in another.andM;Despite the resemblance to existing formats, however, the new disks are notcompatible with digital CDs, CD-ROM, or write-once read-many (WORM) opticaldrives.andP;  Many rewritable disks are not compatible with each other, either,because they use different data formats.andP;  Sony's drive, for example, stores650MB, while Canon's version holds 256MB on a single-sided disk and 512MB ona double-Sided disk.andM;Optical disk drives aren't inherently more difficult or expensive tomanufacture than conventional hard disk drives or even high-density floppydrives.andP;  And rewritable optical drives aren't so different from audio CDplayers, which store the equivalent of up to 550MB on a single disc; you canbuy a CD player for around $100.andP;  Even CD-ROM and WORM drives cost far lessthan rewritable optical drives.andM;So why do rewritable drives cost so much?andP;  They do contain some additionaltechnology, such as a faster head and the ability to both write and erase ona newly developed coating.andP;  Rewritable drives will always be more expensivethan one-way alternatives.andM;But rewritable optical disk drives are simpler and cheaper to manufacturethan videocassette recorders are--and you can buy a VCR in a discountelectronics shop for less than $200.andP;  VCRs are cheap because Japanesemanufacturers have devoted two decades of work to streamlining theirproduction and lowering costs to satisfy the huge worldwide demand.andM;Conventional hard disk drives also enjoy significant economies of scale: theworld market hit $20 billion in 1988.andP;  By contrast, the total world marketfor all optical storage drives last year--CD-ROM and WORM drives--was only$300 million.andP;  The market for rewritable drives is still too insignificant tomeasure.andM;Small volumes mean short production lines, tiny parts orders, and highprices.andP;  It's a classic chicken-and-egg problem: the initial market foroptical drives isn't big enough to lower prices, and volume won't pick upuntil prices come down.andM;An Unstable ContenderandM;Meanwhile, Matsushita Electric Industrial Company, which beat Sony's BetamaxVCR format with VHS, is attempting to do it againi in optical drives.andM;Matsushita is working on &quot;phase-change&quot; optical disks.andP;  Since phase-changedrives are inherently &quot;a lot simpler&quot; than magneto-optical drives, they'reeven easier to manufacture, claims Matsushita engineer Tony Jasionowski.andO;Phase-change drives might also perform better, because unlike magneto-opticaldrives they could erase and write in a single pass.andM;Magneto-optical drives write datay by making tiny changes in the magneticorientation of a small area on the disk.andP;  The &quot;read&quot; laser must be extremelysensitive to pick up the subtle changes in orientation.andM;In a phase-change disk, heat from the &quot;write&quot; laser changes the crystalliinestructure of the metallic coating, rather than just reorienting the magneticfield.andP;  The laser creates a point that reflects light differently from anunchanged spot, making phase-change disks much easier to read.andP;  Moreover,phase-change drives should be at least partially compatible with existingWORM drives.andM;Matsushita hasn't yet been able to produce phase-change optical disks thatare as durable as magneto-optical disks.andP;  Current state of the art allowsabout 100,000 rewrites on a phase-change disk, according to Jasionowski,while magnetic and magneto-optical disks can handle up to a million rewrites.andM;Cutting CornersandM;Apart from mass production, another way to cut prices would be to scale downthe product.andP;  Japan's Epson and Kodak's Verbatim subsidiary are said to beexploring the possibility of making 3-1/2-inch optical drives with a &quot;mere&quot;80MB of storage capacity per removable disk.andM;An 80MB disk would use only a fraction of the potential capacity of opticalstorage but would be much cheaper to make.andP;  You could simply pop in anotherdisk if you needed more storage.andM;The product wouldn't be leading-edge technology, but Epson and Kodak couldboost storage density later.andP;  And getting into the market soon might allowKodak to seize from Japan the lead in optical storage manufacturing.andM;The Japanese have pretty much perfected the technology for rewritable opticaldisk drives.andP;  All that remains is to bring costs down and find appropriateuses for all that memory.andP;  Unless the two move hand in hand, however, opticaldisk drives will remain nothing more than an expensive curiosity.andM;Magneto-Optical Drives: Milking the TechnologyandM;Magneto-optical disks combine elements of magnetic and optical technology topack vast quantities of data into a small area.andP;  Magneto-optical drives storeinformation by altering the magnetic orientation of tiny portions of thedisk's metallic coating.andM;A magneto-optical disk leaves the factory with its magnetic field oriented ina uniform direction.andP;  The top of the disk drive contains a powerfulelectromagnet.andP;  At room temperature, this magnet has no effect on the disk'smagnetic field.andP;  But the drive employs a write laser to heat minute areas ofthe disk to very high temperatures, allowing the drive's magnet to slightlyalter the disk's orientation.andM;When the drive reads the disk with a separate low-power laser, this slightchange in the magnetic field's orientation makes it reflect the lightdifferently--enough to change the spot from a 0 to a 1.andM;Because the write laser is so precise, it can change the disk's orientationin very tiny areas.andP;  Optical disks can store a bit of data in about 0.8square micron, compared with the 10 to 20 square microns required by today'smagnetic disks.andM;As optical technology matures, the new disks could hold up to 30 times asmuch as an equivalent magnetic disk.andP;  A 5-1/4-inch optical disk couldtheoretically hold 10 gigabytes, while conventional 5-1/4-inch hard disks areexpected to top out at about 300MB.andM;Unfortunately, optical disk drives are slower than conventional hard disks.andO;For any drive to stop and start quickly, its heads must be small; engineersof magnetic hard drives have been working on miniaturization for years.andP;  Thelaser and associated equipment on a current optical drive head weigh about 75grams, almost 10 times as much as the electromagnetic equipment on the headof a conventional hard drive.andP;  While smaller optical drive heads are sure tobe developed, their more complicated equipment means they are likely toremain significantly larger than magnetic drive heads.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
