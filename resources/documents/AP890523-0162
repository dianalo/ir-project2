(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Former PTL leaders Jim Bakker and RichardDortch will go on trial Aug. 28 on charges they diverted more than$4 million in PTL money, a federal judge ruled Tuesday.   U.S. District Judge Robert Potter did not rule on a motion tomove the trial away from Charlotte or on Dortch's request that hebe tried separately.   Bakker and Dortch, who was Bakker's top aide, are charged withmail and wire fraud, conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud anddiverting more than $4 million for their own use.   If convicted on all counts, each man faces up to 120 years inprison and more than $5 million in fines.   Neither Bakker nor Dortch attended the 10-minute hearing.   Bakker resigned as PTL head in March 1987 amidst a sex and moneyscandal triggered by reports of a sexual liaison with former churchsecretary Jessica Hahn.   The PTL ministry filed for bankruptcy reorganization threemonths later. PTL owes creditors more than $130 million, accordingto bankruptcy records.   Attorneys in the case said they expect the trial to last five orsix weeks.   PTL's theme park, Heritage USA, other property and theministry's television network were bought by Toronto businessmanStephen Mernick for $65 million.   On Monday, Potter set a July 5 trial date for brothers James andDavid Taggart on charges of conspiracy and tax evasion in thealleged misuse of $1.1 million in PTL ministry money.   David Taggart is a former personal aide to Bakker, and JamesTaggart is a former interior decorator for the ministry. Both menhave pleaded innocent to charges of income tax evasion andconspiracy.   If convicted on all counts, the Taggarts could each be sentencedto up to 30 years in prison and be fined $1.35 million.</TEXT></DOC>
