Picture hundreds of traders sitting or standing at consoles, each with perhaps eight or more flashing computer screens. Picture each trader with two telephone handsets, connected by direct line to maybe 500 customers and fellow traders. Picture &quot;squawk boxes&quot; blaring out more information, and traders waving their arms and shouting across the room, all the while keeping an eye out for signals from the department head.    It's amazing what people will put up with to earn a half a million dollars a year. According to Michael Brill, president of the Buffalo Organization for Social andamp; Technological Innovation Inc., &quot;No one has taken the time to analyze what really goes on in these places, what these people need and what they feel, what the sources and effects of stress are, whether there are any environmentally driven sources of error, whether there might be environmental-design sources of increased performance, or whether a good environment is even perceived as a real reward by traders.&quot;    Even so, trading-room design has been improving lately.    Some of the improvements concern the glut of data that pours in to each trading position. Lewis Knopf, marketing manager, data systems, at Reuters Information Service Inc., a supplier of data, says he doubts many traders really need -- or can use -- eight screens of information at once. &quot;It's numbing; nobody can assimilate all that,&quot; he says. And institutions don't want to buy data they can't use.    For those reasons, Reuters, Telerate, Quotron and other purveyors of market information no longer require customers to buy data by the screenful. They are beginning to offer electronic formats that allow their clients to take data in pieces, choosing what to show and how to show it.    This has enabled the largest institutions to &quot;grow their own&quot; custom trading displays. At Citicorp Investment Bank, for instance, Harold A. Rich, head of technology and systems planning, has developed a system in which multiple screens are replaced by a single large high-resolution color screen with four windows. A trader can bring up information, perhaps in the form of a graph, can plug it into analytical programs and can execute trades -- all using a &quot;bombsight&quot; pointing device instead of a pencil or keyboard. He can also &quot;keep his book&quot; on the screen, staying abreast of his inventory and profitablilty.    The trading room itself is getting better too. John H. Winkler, general partner at Skidmore Owings andamp; Merrill, the New York-based architectural firm, who has designed trading rooms for Paine Webber, Merrill Lynch, Chase Manhattan Bank and Manufacturers Hanover Trust, among others, says, for instance, that the use of color has become more sophisticated. &quot;The tendency these days is to use cooler, more neutral colors that don't promote stress.&quot; He also says that it's desirable to have a large room with a high ceiling. &quot;When the activity becomes frenetic, a large volume helps to dissipate the kinetic energy.&quot;    A Proper Robot   Robots will soon be moving off the factory floor and into places where the public will come into contact with them. This is raising design issues that didn't need to be confronted as long as the mechanical servants remained in out-of-the-way places.    For example, consider Helpmate, a fetch-and-carry robot that Transitions Research Corp., of Bethel, Conn., expects to begin field testing in hospitals next January. The technological problems are daunting enough: The critter has to be able to find its way through the hospital corridors, delivering such cargo as meals, lab specimens and X-ray plates. It even has to ring for an elevator, hop aboard and select the correct floor.    In addition, Robert B. Croston, TRC's senior industrial designer, has been thinking about how the public and Helpmate are going to get along. &quot;First of all, the robot has to be safe,&quot; he says. &quot;It can't have any sharp protrusions, and we may even give it a soft skin. If someone bumps into it, it shouldn't fall over and hurt another person.&quot; And people shouldn't be able to hurt the robot, either, for instance by trying to tamper with it or send it on a mischievous errand.    As for appearance, Mr. Croston says it's important that the machine be nonthreatening. &quot;We found in tests that some people were concerned about the camera 'eye' in the guidance system -- they felt it was too much like Big Brother,&quot; he says, &quot;so we're making it unobtrusive.    &quot;We want to impart a sense of quality, like any other highly technical hospital apparatus. It won't look futuristic, and it won't be toylike. This is no R2D2.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
