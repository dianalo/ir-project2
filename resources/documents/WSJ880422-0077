Chairman Armand Hammer said the planned acquisition of Cain Chemical Inc. could add as much as $100 million to Occidental's net income this year.    Last year, the oil company reported net of $213 million, including heavy one-time gains realized from tax credits and the sale of chemical operations.    Dr. Hammer, speaking to analysts here, wouldn't project the company's first-quarter earnings. But he hinted broadly that the numbers, expected to be reported Monday, would exceed last year's net of 50 cents a share, or $97 million. &quot;By the smile on my face, you should know it will be pleasant news,&quot; he said.    Dr. Hammer told analysts that Occidental is going to build one of the largest chemical companies in the U.S., but President Ray Irani tempered those remarks by saying oil and gas would remain the company's most important business. To emphasize his point, Mr. Irani said $580 million of Occidental's total 1988 spending budget of $850 million would be devoted to the search for and production of petroleum and natural gas.    Last year, Occidental spent $410 million of its $730 million budget for oil and gas exploration and production.    Dr. Hammer said the $1.25 billion Cain acquisition, plus more than $800 million of Cain's debt, will be paid off through the company's cash flow within several years. Cain is expected to add $200 million to Occidental's cash flow this year. Occidental's total debt already exceeds about $7 billion.    Once the Cain purchase is complete, Dr. Hammer said he will convert the short-term financing used to acquire the petrochemical company into long-term debt to lower the interest costs. He may also issue new shares of Los Angeles-based Occidental to help raise capital.    Dr. Hammer said he is building the company's commitment to chemicals to offset the company's reliance on the price of oil, which in recent months has fallen despite the possibility of an oil-production alliance between the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and certain non-OPEC oil-producing nations. &quot;It's not smart to have too many eggs in one basket,&quot; he said. &quot;Eventually, the price of oil will go up, but it may take two to three years,&quot; he said.    Occidental's purchase of Cain hasn't damped Dr. Hammer's interest in acquiring an interest in Texaco Canada Inc. He said his representatives were in contact with Morgan Stanley andamp; Co., Texaco's investment banker and had been advised that when Texaco Inc. is ready to talk about the sale of its Canadian subsidiary, they'd be in contact.    Dr. Hammer, who is celebrating his 90th birthday next month, said he doesn't have plans to retire any time soon. &quot;I'll retire when Occidental's stock hits $100 a share,&quot; he quipped. In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, Occidental shares closed at $27.25, down 25 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
