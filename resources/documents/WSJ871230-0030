Latin American debtors certainly can't afford to repay the hundreds of billions of dollars they owe their bankers, and the banks can in no way fully write off such a vast sum. Now, in an unusual recognition of shared interests, J.P. Morgan and Mexico have stepped out of the thicket with a novel device that could profoundly change the dynamics of the debt problem.    In effect, Morgan has agreed -- with the backing of the U.S. government -- to help Mexico transform part of its huge debt into a kind of balloon-payment mortgage, in which repayment of principal would be delayed for 20 years and would be at significantly less than 100 cents on the dollar.    In return, Morgan and other bank lenders to Mexico that choose to participate should get more for their loans than they could expect from selling them on the open market. And the participating banks can end much of the uncertainty among investors and depositors over how much the loans are worth.    &quot;This is the first really workable idea that accomplishes a reduction in the stock of Mexican debt, a reduction in debt service, but is done as a market-based exercise on a strictly voluntary basis,&quot; comments Assistant Treasury Secretary David Mulford.    Under the plan, initially reported in this newspaper and then announced yesterday, Mexico will offer commercial banks an opportunity to swap, at a discount, a portion of their troubled loans to that country for up to $10 billion in new, marketable Mexican securities. These securities would be backed by 20-year, zero-coupon U.S. Treasury bonds, but at no cost to the American taxpayer.    The plan seems to mark an end to the era when the debt problem was held at bay largely through the strength of the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board or the head of the International Monetary Fund. The Mexican debt swap represents a case where one bank and one debtor nation worked out a separate solution. More individual bargaining of that sort is likely in the future.    The plan offers a great opportunity for banks whose foreign-debt exposure is relatively light or that have already set aside unusually large reserves against possible losses on such debt. These include Morgan and Bankers Trust, a host of regional banks and some major European banks. But it puts pressure on U.S. banks whose exposure is large, such as Bank of America and Manufacturers Hanover. The plan requires that participating banks recognize substantial losses on their Mexican debt, which some may not be able to afford easily. And Mexico retains the right to reject the banks' bids if it isn't satisfied with the ratio of old to new debt offered by the banks.    Thus, how widely the new device will be used is a matter of conjecture, and it is hardly a panacea for the debt problem. William R. Cline, senior fellow at the Institute for International Economics in Washington, calls the debt plan &quot;a useful innovation of modest dimensions. I don't think it's a watershed.&quot;    But for the first time, the U.S. is throwing its weight behind a plan that sanctions losses by banks on loans to a big debtor country. Until now, the U.S. government has insisted that heavily indebted countries should pay their debts in full.    Even if the plan works for Mexico, it would still fall far short of solving the international debt problem. The scale of the problem is enormous, and the plan affects only a small portion of the some $400 billion that Latin American countries owe Western creditors. And outside Latin America are many other troubled debtor countries: The Philippines owes more than $28 billion, Yugoslavia $20 billion.    Moreover, because the plan pivots on Mexico's strong foreign-exchange reserves, bankers say similar plans probably wouldn't work for other big debtors, such as Brazil and Argentina, which are weak in foreign-exchange and gold reserves. Under the plan, Mexico would spend up to $2 billion to buy the Treasury securities.    Even for Mexico, substantial problems remain. The plan would help cut the nation's debt to commercial banks by an estimated $10 billion to $20 billion -- but Mexico owes foreign creditors more than $100 billion. Of that, $78 billion is bank debt, of which $53 billion is owed by the Mexican government. U.S. banks are owed $24 billion by Mexican borrowers.    Moreover, the plan &quot;doesn't solve {Mexico's} cash problem,&quot; says Robert Albertson, a Goldman Sachs analyst, who notes that it calls for Mexico to pay a higher rate of interest on some of its remaining debt. But he sees a bright spot; the plan, he says, &quot;reintroduces a government role into the international debt problem,&quot; and he expects that other industrialized countries soon may announce similar plans to ease pressures on their banks.    The plan will also intensify debate among bankers and accountants about how banks should value their loans to troubled debtor countries. Some accountants contend that banks should mark their developing-country loans down to the values offered in the small but growing secondary loan market, especially if they start selling or trading some of them.    This new proposal requires participating banks to recognize a discount on some of their Mexican loans. Why, then, some accountants wonder, shouldn't such banks mark all their loans to market value? Morgan officials adamantly oppose this suggestion, saying banks mark loans to market only when they intend to sell or trade them. If a bank submits some of its Mexican debt at a discount under the proposal, it wouldn't contaminate the rest of that bank's Mexican portfolio, they say.    Investors and some bankers warmed to the Morgan-Mexico plan, and the stocks of several big U.S. banks rose yesterday. &quot;It's a very favorable development. It isn't going to totally solve the problem, but it could be relatively important in reducing the pressure,&quot; said Richard S. Simmons, vice chairman of Chemical New York Corp., who expects other stronger debtors such as Venezuela to try similar plans if the Mexican one works. Like many other bankers, he declined to say whether his bank would participate.    But other countries clearly might want to try to participate in such a plan. It &quot;is one of the ideas&quot; that Brazil will present during its debt negotiations scheduled to reopen in January, says Rubens Antonio Barbosa, an adviser to Brazilian finance ministers. &quot;Brazil is looking for a new way to tackle this question on a longer term.&quot; Adds Luiz Belluzzo, a former consultant to the Brazilian government, &quot;I can't imagine Brazil negotiating on any other terms.&quot;    And in Mexico, an official of a major Western bank expects hard bargaining between the banks and the Mexicans over terms of the swaps. He says that the Mexicans will seek discounts in the debt of about 50% but that most major banks won't be likely to accept more than 35% or 40%. In any event, he adds, &quot;It will be useful in getting rid of some small banks, which have been nuisances in the negotiations up to now.&quot;    As 1987 draws to a close, the international debt crisis -- which first broke in the summer of 1982 -- has been intensifying. Last February, Brazil declared a moratorium on $67 billion of foreign bank debt, and despite months of talks, the country still hasn't resumed servicing it. In May, Citicorp, the largest U.S. bank, added $3 billion to reserves for developing-country debt, starting a chain of similar actions that knocked many major U.S. banks -- Citicorp included -- into the red for 1987.    This month, Bank of Boston began what could be a new round of reserving. It also took the unprecedented step of writing off $200 million of loans to troubled developing countries. Meanwhile, Argentina, Latin America's third-largest debtor, looks as if it will run out of money within the next few months, raising fears among bankers that it also will declare a moratorium.    And Moody's Investors Service has said it is considering downgrading the credit ratings of 11 major U.S. banks because of shaky foreign loans. One of the banks under scrutiny is Morgan, the only remaining major U.S. bank to have a triple-A credit rating, Moody's highest.    The plan carries potential risks for all major parties involved. It could start an avalanche of similar plans, sponsored by financial-services companies or foreign governments, that could leave weak banks holding huge amounts of debt while stronger banks replace shaky credits with guaranteed bonds.    Foreign banks, particularly in Europe, are generally better reserved than U.S. banks and could monopolize the Mexican exchange offer because they could afford to offer Mexico bigger discounts. For instance, Deutsche Bank, which is 70% reserved against Mexican debt, could make a 20% &quot;profit&quot; if a 50% bid won acceptance by the Mexican government. But Citibank would have to charge off or reserve another 25% if it made a 50% bid. The U.S. Treasury then would be sponsoring a plan allowing foreign banks to wriggle away from their Mexican loans, while further confounding big U.S. banks.    The Mexicans are giving up some of their hard-won foreign-exchange reserves to chip off only a portion -- though a potentially significant one -- of their huge foreign debt. That may prove unpopular at home, particularly at a time of economic austerity.    But the plan also offers all parties advantages. For banks, it's a chance to enhance the credit-worthiness of their Mexican loan portfolio, by replacing existing debt with bonds backed by the U.S. government. And though they may take some loss, banks would earn a better interest-rate margin on the new bonds than they did on their old debt.    For the U.S., it offers an opportunity to sell $10 billion of 20-year bonds and perhaps a chance to strengthen some of its larger banks.    Several bankers and politicians stress the bright side of the plan. &quot;We think the proposed Mexican program offers relief for the country, hope for its people and a market-oriented framework within which individual banks can make their own determination as to an appropriate course of action,&quot; says John F. McGillicuddy, Manufacturers Hanover's chief executive.    In Washington, Sen. Bill Bradley says: &quot;I am pleased that the Treasury has taken this first step toward a workable solution to the Third World debt crisis. This plan, which recognizes the need for interest-rate and debt relief, should help Mexico channel funds toward the rebuilding of its economy.&quot; The New Jersey Democrat has asserted that any solution to the debt crisis must involve sacrifices by banks and debtor nations alike.    Rep. Charles Schumer, a New York Democrat who has proposed a Third World debt relief plan, says, &quot;For the first time, the Treasury has recognized the absurdity of Faustian finance.&quot; The Treasury announcement was, he adds, &quot;an acknowledgment that it's useless to keep lending to Third World nations just so those nations can turn the money around to the banks in the form of interest payments.&quot;    U.S. government officials reject charges that the plan is a Treasury bailout of Mexico or U.S. banks. The zero-coupon bonds will carry an effective interest rate slightly lower than the rate the Treasury has to pay on bonds it sells in the open market. Thus, the government may actually save money by raising $2 billion to finance its deficit at a low interest rate.    The banks are being offered &quot;an exit-bond with a U.S. instrument backing it,&quot; says Mr. Cline, the Washington economist. &quot;To participate, banks will probably insist on 60 or 70 cents on the dollar.&quot; Mexico may have to pay more than the 50 cents on the dollar recently quoted in the secondary market because it is asking investors to wait 20 years. &quot;I'd be surprised if many banks went in at discounts much deeper than 30 cents on the dollar,&quot; he says, adding that the plan could put upward pressure on the secondary market.    The Mexican arrangement, he says, is &quot;a device to provide added psychological security for a bank considering whether to convert&quot; its old debt for the new debt that Mexico will offer. He emphasizes that &quot;this doesn't represent a shift to a debt-forgiveness strategy. That would have to be mandatory where all banks were required to settle for 60 cents on the dollar. This doesn't do that. This says we will continue to rely on a market-based approach.&quot;    The proposal is a Morgan riposte to Citicorp and is the latest round in a long spat between the banking titans.    Colleagues and peers say Morgan Chairman Lewis Preston was infuriated by Citicorp's reserve announcement last May. These sources say Mr. Preston, many other senior New York bankers and several government officials loathed the fanfare that accompanied the announcement by Citicorp Chairman John S. Reed.    Breaking with tradition and without consulting his colleagues at other banks, Mr. Reed dared competitors to follow. At his May 19 press conference, Mr. Reed also smilingly drew the world's attention to the relative weakness of Bank of America and Manufacturers Hanover.    Despite having the strongest capital and reserves of the big U.S. banks, Morgan was the slowest to follow Citicorp's reserve increase. Morgan, which tries to project a quiet and cultivated air of consensus in banking issues, was eager to establish a different framework for attacking the debt problem.    &quot;We started looking into this {proposal} in response to Mexico's good economic performance and the rise in its foreign exchange reserves,&quot; says the vice chairman of Morgan's credit-policy committee, Rodney B. Wagner. Mr. Wagner, Gonzalo de las Heras, the head of the bank's Latin American division, and a team of Morgan debt specialists began working on a proposal in July. They based it on an exchange offer that would give something to all the parties involved. Mr. Preston and Morgan's president, Dennis Weatherstone, also took part.    A proposal, based on similar plans for Mexican private-sector debtors, was presented to Mexico in August. The Mexicans accepted it with modifications and in September empowered Morgan to organize the exchange offer on their behalf. Bankers and officials close to the proposal say the most time-consuming task was working out the Treasury's role.    The plan was held up in part by the recent temporary expiration of the Treasury's authority to issue long-term bonds. But that authority was increased by $20 billion as part of the budget package signed by President Reagan last week.    Citicorp now may be trying to bury the hatchet. Despite rumors that the Morgan proposal has riled it, Citicorp yesterday released a statement praising the proposal as offering &quot;a new element of market-based flexibility for banks in managing their Mexican&quot; loans. Mexico, Citicorp said, &quot;is well placed to make such an exchange offer.&quot;    Meanwhile, Mexico had its own reasons for seeking new debt arrangements. The stock-market crash and the continuing huge trade deficits in the U.S., the largest market for Mexico's exports, raised doubts about Mexico's strategy for achieving economic recovery based on exports.    And Mexico itself was showing signs of what many called &quot;debtor's fatigue&quot; as the country headed into its sixth year of crisis. The faltering economy was affecting everything from public health to juvenile delinquency to the divorce rate. Mexico's political system, which has owed its five decades of stability to the compromise and collaboration of diverse interests, has also been showing signs of wear. Earlier this month, Mexico's traditionally docile labor unions threatened a general strike unless the government came through with a large pay increase to offset the impact of the peso devaluation.    Given all the problems facing the new debt accord, J.P. Morgan remains cautious. &quot;We're not going to pop any champagne corks until we've finished the whole thing,&quot; Mr. Wagner says.    ---   Jeff Bailey in Chicago, Rose Gutfeld in Washington, G.
