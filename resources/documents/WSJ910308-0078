The timing of Mr. Sieuw's visit is viewed as a potentialopportunity for U.S. companies, administration officialssaid. Last month, Taiwan confirmed a six-year $301.4 billionnational development plan that includes infrastructureprojects such as power generation, airports, high-speed raillinks and environmental programs, U.S. and Taiwan officialssaid.</LP><TEXT>   Several big U.S. companies, including WestinghouseElectric Corp. and General Electric Co., are interested inbidding on many of these projects, a senior administrationofficial said. &quot;Traditionally, they have given a preferenceto big U.S. suppliers for capital projects,&quot; the officialsaid. He added that France is aggressively courting Taiwan inan attempt to win projects for its companies.   &quot;We have a great deal of interest in Taiwan, both in thenuclear and conventional power generation fields, and will beparticipating in the bidding for projects,&quot; a Westinghousespokesman said.   Mr. Sieuw, who is responsible for trade matters, willattend the annual meeting of the U.S.-Republic of Chinabusiness council, which deals with important bilateraleconomic issues.   His visit during the week of April 8 is also timelybecause it follows on the heels of the annual National TradeEstimate Report. The administration's report, which isscheduled to be released at the end of March, lists countriesand barriers that hinder U.S. export prospects.   In recent years, Taiwan has been included in the report.And tensions still remain over the protection of intellectualproperty, market access for financial services companies andfarm products.   Nevertheless, the U.S. trade deficit with Taiwan hasnarrowed sharply in the past few years. In 1990, it totaled$11.4 billion, compared with $13.3 billion in 1989, $12.58billion in 1988, when Taiwan bought a lot of gold in theU.S., and $17.2 billion in 1987.   Meanwhile, U.S. trade relations with China have becomemore strained. China had a $6.2 billion trade surplus withthe U.S. in 1989, $2.7 billion higher than in 1988.   China's vice minister for trade, Gu Yong Jiang, was inWashington last November for talks with administrationofficials. There have been growing tensions over China'slarge textile exports to the U.S. and particularly over itsalleged bypassing of its textile quota by exporting throughthird countries. In addition, during the past two years,China has followed less liberal trade policies, resorting tostricter import licensing and exchange-rate policies to favorexport industries.   Such tensions are likely to surface in May, when the U.S.decides whether to extend China's most-favored-nation tradestatus, which is the most favorable trade status granted tonational trading partners. Continued political repression inChina has made many U.S. lawmakers reluctant to continuegranting such status. But President Bush has said he remainscommitted to extending that status to China.</TEXT></DOC>
