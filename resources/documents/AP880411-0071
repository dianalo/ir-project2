Gerald Harvey, 39, a vice president at the Santa Monica-basedservice, was found dead in his Westwood home, along with his wifeof one year, Frederica, ``Deri'' Rudulth, also 39, on Saturday,said Z Channel spokesman Harry Clein.   Harvey was listed as a suicide and his wife as a homicidevictim, Los Angeles County coroner's office investigator PaulWillis said Sunday.   A police report said Harvey was believed to be suffering from amental disorder.   ``He had been sick all last week,'' Clein said. ``He had anulcer and I guess he was bothered by it. He wasn't in the office,but he felt better Friday.''   Harvey joined the Z Channel in 1980 and was credited withattracting an influential entertainment industry audience to the14-year-old service.   As programming chief, Harvey developed the popular andsuccessful format that combined classic, European and artisticfilms with high-powered Hollywood movies. This month, the channeladded Los Angeles Dodgers and California Angels home games to itsline-up.   Under Harvey's direction, Z broadcast the uncut versions of suchfilms as ``Heaven's Gate,'' ``1900,'' ``Fanny and Alexander'' and``Das Boot.''   Ms. Rudulth, a former attorney and stand-up comedian, alsopublished the Westwood Insider, a free weekly newspaper thatcirculated in the upscale west side of Los Angeles.   Next-door neighbor Mary Pringle said she was pruning rosesaround Saturday afternoon when she thought she heard a gunshot. Shesaid she disregarded the noise as probably children playing, butthen heard a second shot about an hour later.   ``(Ms. Rudulth) was an exemplary neighbor for me,'' Pringlesaid. ``I didn't really know him. He seemed to be an odd person.He'd apparently been having nervous problems, and she wasvulnerable and was there.''   The slayings occurred two days before Harvey was to have given adeposition in a lawsuit filed by Z Channel against rival cabletelevision service Home Box Office, the nation's largest.   The suit contends the HBO, which is owned by Time Inc.,``secured or coerced'' the cooperation of four major film studiosin ``restraining and impairing'' Z Channel's ability to competewith HBO.   ``I think Jerry was concerned,'' said Clein. ``The Z Channel wasa great love of his. But I think he felt things were going alongwell, and that in view of the suit that Z had a good case.''</TEXT></DOC>
