<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-82-0785 </DOCNO><TEXT>A series of pyridine and quinoline analogs of isomeric distyrylnaphthalenesand styryl- and distyrylanthracenes has been synthesized. Their spectral-luminescentproperties were studied. Compounds whose structures are sterically hinderedin the ground state have the highest Stokes' shift. The compounds synthesizedhave a trans-configuration; in their IR spectra there are absorptionbands in the 970-990 cm{sup -1} region, characteristic for trans-disubstitutedalkenes. In the PMR spectrum of 9,10-di[{beta}-(4-pyridyl)vinyl]anthracene,two doublets of the AB spin system are observed with chemical shiftsof 6.91 and 7.37 ppm, belonging to the vinyl protons. The SSCC (J = 16.5Hz) indicates a trans-configuration of this compound.</TEXT></DOC>
