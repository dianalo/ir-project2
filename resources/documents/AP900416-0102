(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Dog may be man's best friend, but sometimesdogs choose other creatures dear _ or deer, as the case may be.   Richard Faulkner's yellow Labrador, Jake, has taken up with achummy young buck that showed up in Faulkner's wooded back yard acouple of weeks ago, looking hungry and lost.   Jake, a frisky 3-year-old, made the deer feel at home, sharinghis water bucket and trying to entice the woodland animal intogames.   ``Jake must think the deer is a dog and the deer must think Jakeis a deer,'' said Faulkner.   The dog tosses a bone into the air, hoping the deer will get theidea and play along. The deer watches closely, but doesn't get it,or just doesn't like that particular game.   He does occasionally hunker down on the ground nose-to-nose withJake, Faulkner said. And when frightened, the deer huddles nearJake's back-yard dog house for protection.   ``I can't understand it and I've thought about it quite a bit,too,'' said Faulkner, 59, who retired Friday from his job as anight watchman at a quarry.   ``I think both of them are lonely.''   The deer follows Faulkner to his garden and lets him get within5 feet.   ``I think there's a bond between people and animals,'' he said.   Faulkner refuses to make a pet of the animal, saying he fearsthat the deer could hurt children in his neighborhood. He triedscaring the buck off recently but it returned.</TEXT><DATELINE>SEAGOVILLE, Texas (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A prisoner says he has invented adevice that will prevent the crime that put him behind bars.   ``It has kept me very busy,'' said Joe Walker, 34. ``I've workedon this 18 hours a day. I probably never would have done it if Ihadn't been arrested. I never would have had the time. Right now,all I've got is time.''   Walker is serving a six-year term in federal prison forinterstate transportation of stolen property, part of what he callshis ``past minor indiscretions.''   Walker and engineer Tim Jensen say they have a patent pending onThe Trailer Guard, which they say will stop the theft of trucktrailers.   Walker said the Trailer Guard makes it impossible for anyone toconnect a truck's ``fifth wheel'' _ the coupling on the rear of thetractor _ to the trailer's kingpin and haul off the parked trailer.   In 1987, 177,807 trailers were stolen nationwide at a loss of $8billion, according to the American Trucking Association.   Walker said he had to shop around to find an engineer to helpwith his invention.   ``I had called several engineers, but as soon as I told themwhere I was calling from they said, `Sorry, can't help you,'''Walker said.   Walker, who has 18 months left of his sentence, made hiscomments by telephone from the Federal Correctional Institute atSeagoville, 15 miles southeast of Dallas.   Walker said after he is released, he would like to stay in theDallas area and set up his business.</TEXT></DOC>
