(product development).andO;Ticker:    IBM.andO;Product:   LAN Server (Computer network software) (product specifications).andO;Topic:     User NeedsEthernetConnectivityLocal Area NetworksProduct Development.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Imagine what might have happened if Bob Metcalf had worked for IBM in Raleighrather than for Xerox in Palo Alto 15 years ago.andP;  We might have true-BlueEthernet products today.andM;However, as many IBM customers have discovered, it's going to take more thanwishful thinking before IBM gets behind Ethernet completely.andP;  I was surprisedat one session that I gave at a NetWorld show to learn how many people hadIBM mainframes and were using Ethernet cables.andP;  So is IBM, I guess.andM;But maybe the Ethernet logjam is showing signs of breaking free at last.andO;I've heard rumors that IBM is finally going to give Ethernet a place in theBlue universe.andP;  Well, now is the time.andP;  IBM has a new server-LAN operatingsystem with OS/2 LAN Server, which can support multiple protocols more easilythan could DOS.andP;  So, if I were Ellen Hancock, head of IBM's CommunicationsDivision, this would be my laundry list to make my Ethernet customers happy,and to bring IBM into Ethernet as a major player.andM;Build drivers for third-party Ethernet cards.andP;  Take the leading Ethernetvendors, and build some OS/2 LAN Server drivers for their high-performanceservers and DOS PC LAN program drivers for their workstations.andP;  Get the bestsoftware-driver engineers money can buy, and write tight code with highperformance.andM;Right now, IBM only supports IBM cards for its Token-Ring and PC Networkproducts.andP;  If it is going to compete, IBM has got to realize that there arelots of other LAN cards already installed in corporate America.andP;  And the bestway to compete is to build performance in at the beginning.andM;Build IBM Ethernet cards.andP;  While we are wishing, we might as well go forbroke: IBM should build its own cards and package them with drivers for otherpeople's LAN operating systems and protocol managers.andP;  IBM can set a goodexample of how to help rather than hinder these efforts to widenmultiple-protocol support by packaging such support as part of its ownEthernet offerings.andP;  By ''building its own,'' I don't mean the Sytek-OEMstyle of deal that IBM has done for some of its new LAN cards.andP;  I mean hiringits own engineers and drawing its own designs.andM;Enable internal Ethernet/Token-Ring bridges.andP;  Just supporting Ethernet LANcard drivers is not enough.andP;  IBM also needs to provide bridging software thatwould enable a user to install multiple LAN cards of multiple topologies in asingle server.andP;  It could also build dedicated hardware bridges to connectmultiple Ethernet segments.andM;Create Ethernet connectors to IBM minis and mainframes.andP;  I have alreadywritten about the Ethernet version of the Token-Ring Interface coupler toIBM's 3725s, 3174s and IBM minis in my March 6 column.andP;  This would make SNAgateways for those Ethernet users better, more reliable performers thansynchronous modems or coax connections (the options available now).andM;Upgrade LAN management tools to handle Ethernet.andP;  IBM currently has somedecent products to manage Token-Ring connections.andP;  Products such as NetViewand LAN Manager (IBM's version, which is not a LAN operating system likeMicrosoft's product of the same name, but a piece of diagnostic software)need to be extended to handle Ethernet-connected PCs and hosts.andM;There are other issues involved in Ethernet support, but I'll leave them foranother column.andM;----------My colleague, Bob Enyart, was the source of some of the ideas presented here.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
