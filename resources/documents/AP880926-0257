Kroger officials contended the restructuring would be morelucrative for shareholders than a $4.6 billion bid by KohlbergKravis Roberts andamp; Co. or a competing $4.32 billion offer from DartGroup Corp.   Late Friday, when Kroger announced that its board had approvedthe restructuring, the company also said it had rejected bothoffers as inadequate.   Spokesmen for Dart and Kohlberg Kravis declined comment Monday.   The restructuring, which must be approved by shareholders, isworth $57 to $61 per share, or as much as $4.6 billion, officialssaid.   The plan, first publicly proposed on Sept. 13, would payshareholders $40 a share in cash, plus securities valued at $8 andpublicly-traded stock worth between $5 and $10. Kroger has 78.6million outstanding shares.   Dart, a retailing company which has made a number ofunsuccessful takeover bids in recent years, offered last Monday tobuy Kroger for $55 per share _ $43 in cash and securities valued at$12 _ or about $4.32 billion.   Kohlberg Kravis, which has outbid Dart for three othercorporations in recent years, entered the bidding last Tuesday byoffering to buy Kroger for $58.50 per share _ $50 in cash and $8.50in securities, or a total of $4.6 billion.   Goldman Sachs andamp; Co., Kroger's adviser, told company officialsthe Kohlberg Kravis offer raised antitrust issues because theinvestment firm recently acquired two other grocery retailers,Safeway Stores Inc. and Stop andamp; Shop Cos.   Kroger stock rose 62{ cents to close at $56.37{ a share in NewYork Stock Exchange trading Monday.   Company officials said at a news conference they expected theasset sales to raise an estimated $333 million after taxes.   The restructuring would make the company smaller and increaseits debt load, but leave it economically viable and competitive,Chairman Lyle Everingham and President Joseph Pichler said.   Everingham declined to reveal how many employees would be laidoff. The jobs would be eliminated at the grocery retailer'sCincinnati headquarters, he said.   Kroger said it would sell some of its food processingfacilities; its 27-store Fry's division in northern California; itsWelcome Inc. superwarehouse venture in the South and 29supermarkets in North Carolina and South Carolina.   The company also said it would sell its 16-unit Price SaversWholesale Warehouse Inc. to a management-led investment group, andproceed with the sale of its Florida Choice division, whichcomprises 43 supermarkets and 39 liquor stores.   Kroger also announced plans to sell and then lease back storesand real estate in Texas and sell its general merchandisedistribution center in San Marcos, Texas.   The retailer said it had commitments for $3.6 billion infinancing for the restructuring.   Kroger, founded in 1883 by shopkeeper Barney H. Kroger, operatesmore than 1,300 supermarkets, 935 convenience stores and 15membership warehouses in 29 states. The company also processes avariety of food products for sale in its retail stores and tooutside customers.   Kohlberg Kravis won a hostile takeover battle for Beatrice Cos.in 1985, in which the Haft family was a bidder, and outbid theHafts for Safeway in 1986 and Stop andamp; Shop earlier this year.   Dart Group owns the Crown Books bookstore chain and the autoparts retailer Trak Auto Stores.</TEXT></DOC>
