LOUIS -- General Dynamics Corp. said representativesof the Egyptian government and the U.S. Defense Departmentsigned a letter of offer and acceptance for Egypt's fourthorder of F-16 fighter aircraft.   The total value of the order for 46 jets is $1.54 billion,which covers the aircraft, spare engines, weapons and variousother equipment. The aircraft sale alone is valued at about$900 million, General Dynamics said.</LP><TEXT>   Congress was notified of Egypt's intent to purchase theF-16s in late February, the company said, and a 30-day periodpassed without congressional action in opposition to theplan. Signing of the letter makes the order official andgives the U.S. Air Force authority to begin contractnegotiations with General Dynamics under the foreign militarysales process.   The aircraft are to be delivered between November 1993 andmid-1995. Coming after a South Korean announcement last weekthat it intends to purchase 120 additional F-16s, &quot;the newEgyptian order will further sustain F-16 production in FortWorth for international customers at a time when domesticproduction is declining,&quot; said Herb Rogers, vice chairman andgeneral manager of the company's Fort Worth, Texas, plant,where the F-16 is built.   Egypt's previous F-16 orders were for 41, 40 and 47aircraft, bringing the total to 174 with the latest order.</TEXT></DOC>
