The survey evidenced how this feeder zoneextends beyond the outcrops of coal formations of the Toscan facies groupand takes in even part of the neighboring Neogene permeable depositsrepresented, in this area, by sands and conglomerates. Knowledge wasgained of this zone's contribution to the replenishment of the principalreservoir. The evaluation of this contribution, in terms of local annualeffective infiltration was obtained by an analysis of some local geomorphologicaland climatic characteristics and by the application of the Kennesseymethod.</TEXT></DOC>
