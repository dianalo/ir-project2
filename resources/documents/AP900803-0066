Marino, the nation'shighest-ranking black Roman Catholic.   Marino resigned June 1 after the church began investigating hisrelationship with Vicki R. Long, said Bishop James P. Lyke,appointed acting administrator of the Atlanta Archdiocese.   Lyke declined to say Thursday whether Marino would have beenasked to quit, or whether the relationship was a sexual one.   ``I assume that as the result of a two-year relationship, X-Y-Zwould have happened,'' he said at a news conference.   The relationship, first reported Wednesday, came to theattention of church officials in the spring with an anonymous tip,Lyke said. An investigation began May 3, and Marino agreed torelinquish administration of the archdiocese until theinvestigation was complete, he said.   At the time, it was announced that Marino had relinquished hisduties because of stress and a near heart attack.   Church officials later said Marino resigned on July 10, but Lykesaid Thursday he actually submitted his resignation to Vaticanofficials June 1.   Lyke said church officials were not lying when they announcedthat Marino had resigned for ``personal reasons'' and to seek``appropriate spiritual, medical and psychological therapy.''   ``That was true,'' Lyke said. ``What was not announced was thatthe personal reasons involved an intimate relationship with awoman, entered into shortly after his arrival in Atlanta in May1988 and sustained during the next two years.''   Lyke would not reveal details, but said Ms. Long, a Catholicfrom suburban Riverdale, has made a monetary claim against thearchdiocese. He would not disclose the amount she has sought.   The archdiocese granted Ms. Long ``charity payments'' earlierthis year for medical bills, but Lyke would not say how much, whenor why.   Ms. Long had been receiving $1,500 monthly payments apparentlyfrom Marino, and Lyke emphasized that those payments were notchurch money. He refused to speculate on how the archbishop couldhave afforded such an amount.   Church officials have declined to say where Marino is; he waslast said to be recuperating in New York.   Ms. Long refused to comment Wednesday when asked about theallegations. She could not be reached Thursday because hertelephone number is unlisted. Members of St. John the EvangelistChurch, where she is a member, declined to reveal her whereabouts.   In 1987, Ms. Long filed a $2.3 million lawsuit charging that aCatholic priest from Columbus fathered her child. Blood testsconcluded that the priest, the Rev. Donal Keohane, with whom shehad a four-year relationship, did not father the child born in May1986, but the church is paying child support.   ``Certainly priests are tremendously vulnerable from the insidebecause of their own sexual drives and from the outside becausethey become very attractive sexual targets,'' said A.W. RichardSipe, a former Benedictine monk now practicing psychotherapy inBaltimore.   Sipe conducted a 25-year study of priests, to be published nextmonth, that concluded that half of all priests break celibacy vows.   ``The unusual thing with this is it's being discussed,'' hesaid, noting that church officials usually don't comment on churchscandals.   The revelations have triggered anew the continuing debate overwhether celibacy, a discipline required of Roman Catholic priestssince the Middle Ages, is appropriate in the 20th century.   Celibacy has not always been enforced _ three times in the 10thcentury popes were elected who were the sons of priests or formerpopes.   The Rev. Thomas Reese at Georgetown University said the mostrecent bishop to leave the church and marry was James Shannon, anauxiliary bishop of St. Paul, Minn., in the late 1960s.   In 1971, the National Federation of Priests Councils voted infavor of making celibacy optional. And support groups for women andpriests who have had sexual relationships are starting _ one inPennsylvania has about 1,200 members, three-fourths of whom arepriests.</TEXT></DOC>
