Surgeon General C. Everett Koop in a report on passive smoking in December stated that secondhand smoke has 70% more of the carcinogen tar than &quot;firsthand smoke,&quot; as well as 2 1/2 times the carbon monoxide and 73 times the ammonia. He noted that two-thirds of Americans &quot;who think they do not smoke really do. The health hazards of smoking are in the same ambient air nonsmokers share with smokers.&quot;    Last November, the National Academy of Sciences concluded, after a lengthy study, that while it was theoretically possible to isolate nonsmokers on airplanes, to protect them from the hazards of passive smoking would require a major engineering undertaking at impractical cost.    The academy's report noted that lightweight, high-performance filter systems that could effectively remove gases and particles and that would be suitable for aircraft have not yet been developed. It also asserted that aircraft ventilation does not -- and at this time cannot -- meet the standards for acceptable air quality required in a variety of other public places where smoking is allowed.    Some airplane captains will tell you that they smell cigarette smoke in the cockpit as soon as the &quot;no smoking&quot; sign is turned off. It obviously drifts on to the flight deck from the relatively small and confined first-class section, where the nonsmoking rows do not even provide the illusion of protection from passive smoking.    In the no-smoking seats of the coach section one is bothered by smoke, to a greater or lesser degree, depending on where one sits. Experienced travelers avoid the rows immediately behind the first-class smoking section or near the coach smokers' seats.    The no-smoking area is almost healthful, however, compared with the perils of going to the lavatory. This usually requires running the gantlet of the haze and stench of cigarette smoke and dead and dying butts. If the facility is occupied, even a short wait in the smoking section is most unpleasant.    The flight attendants who work in the blue haze have the greatest exposure. The Association of Flight Attendants lists a high incidence of eye irritation, headaches, nasal symptoms and general malaise. A study by Scandinavian Airline Systems (SAS) of about 2,000 cabin attendants showed that almost 70% were &quot;bothered to a great extent by smoky air.&quot; Passengers with pulmonary or cardiovascular diseases are also at high risk from passive smoking.    More than 20 states restrict smoking in public places, and an additional 10 extend the restriction to the workplace. Smoking has long been prohibited in a wide variety of public areas and transportation facilities -- theaters, auditoriums, buses, trains and subways. Does a crowded airplane present any less a health or safety hazard?    The National Research Council, which is the working arm of the National Science Association, has concluded that the prevention of exposure to ambient smoke will be achieved only when there is no smoking allowed on aircraft. In its judgment &quot;the potential health effects of passive smoking are of more concern than the effects of withdrawal by smokers and more people are at risk.&quot;    Government regulation is not essential. It would be in the airlines' interest to voluntarily impose a total ban. Safety would be increased by cutting the risk of in-flight fire. Fuel costs would be reduced by decreasing the demand on the engines to recirculate and cleanse polluted air. The periodic removal of tar and lint from air filters and heating outflow valves would be eliminated, and the general maintenance of the cabins would be less costly.    A major saving also would result from the reduction of insurance premiums. In the past five years more than 300 aircraft accident deaths have been attributed to or related to smoking, as in fires in lavatories. These grim statistics have been used by critics of a smoking ban, who have said that on long smoke-free flights, some heavy smokers will sneak cigarettes into the rest rooms -- extremely dangerous places in which to smoke. But there are smoke alarms available that can't be deactivated by passengers.    As the dangers of passive smoking become more widely understood, the pressures on the airlines are bound to increase. You can bet your last low-tar cigarette that one day in the not-too-distant future an enterprising airline will accentuate the positive. We will all be invited to enjoy its gourmet food and free champagne in the comfort and safety of its smoke-free flights.    ---   Mr. Adler, a retired lawyer living in La Jolla, Calif., is a former vice president of CBS. </TEXT></DOC>
