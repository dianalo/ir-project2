After 21/2 hours of preparation, the last item on the menu has beencompleted. The chef's students leave their seats tophotograph the tarte Tatin in all its mouthwatering glory.   Mr. Sugimoto's six students at this evening session of therecently opened Tokyo branch of Paris's venerable Le CordonBleu cooking school are all young professional women. Theycome to class twice a week, once to watch Mr. Sugimoto'sdemonstration and once to cook under the supervision of thechef and his assistant. A total of 150 students pay 260,000yen ($1,900) each for a three-month course.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;The students like French food because it has a beauty andbrightness they find appealing,&quot; says Mr. Sugimoto. &quot;They areattracted to French culture as a whole, of which Frenchcuisine is so much a part.&quot; Most, he says, are hard working,clever with their hands and quick to learn: &quot;If you show themsomething once, they remember it.&quot;   French cuisine is hardly rare here; in the past decade,French restaurants have spread from the high-rent areas inthe central city to nearly every suburban neighborhood. ForJapanese raised on sushi and soba, the appeal of Frenchcuisine is &quot;the same as that of French literature,&quot; sayslocal restaurant critic Rick Kennedy.   &quot;It's one of the cultural peaks of the world -- and theJapanese are intent on scaling all of them. For youngJapanese women, learning French cuisine is like studyingflower arranging or the tea ceremony. It's a way of becominga cultured person.&quot;   Even so, until April, Tokyo did not have its own branch ofLe Cordon Bleu, which has produced many of the world's topchefs since it opened in Paris in 1898. Apart from theschool's reputation as a producer of top chefs world-wide,the local branch seems a perfect fit: The French and Japaneseboth are serious about maintaining their national identities.And everyone involved has been maintaining pretty well sofar. Many of the students who complete their first courseshere move on to higher classes in Tokyo and Paris, schoolofficials say.   Chef Sugimoto is himself a Le Cordon Bleu graduate who hasreturned to teach at the Tokyo branch after a 13-year careerat restaurants in France and Japan. Although the schoolwelcomes amateurs to its evening classes, it seeks to bringthe professional standards of its Paris headquarters toclasses here.   &quot;We have duplicated the Paris school as much as possible,&quot;says Philippe Kopcsan, Le Cordon Bleu's vicedirector-general. &quot;We teach only French cooking courses in atrue French environment.&quot;   Mr. Kopcsan says Le Cordon Bleu began planning a Tokyobranch when it realized that 20% of the students in its Parisclasses were Japanese. With characteristic French modesty,Mr. Kopcsan says Tokyo was bursting with pent-up demand forthe school. &quot;There is quite a fight for our students afterthey earn the Grand Diploma {the school's top award},&quot; hesays. &quot;We knew that there was an acute demand, and the highnumber of students that we got in the first semester proves{it}.&quot;   That demand, he says, comes not just from aspiringprofessional chefs. Mr. Kopcsan says Japanese areincreasingly clamoring for the graces of French life.   &quot;Already here in Tokyo you have French cuisine and Frenchfilms,&quot; he says. &quot;French cuisine is not fashionable the wayItalian cuisine is. French cuisine is going to last a longtime. French cuisine was the first cuisine to be codified,and it will spread all over the world. There is somethingdeeper in it. It is something that they don't have in Japan.&quot;   Bringing that atmosphere to Daikanyama, an exclusiveresidential and shopping district here, required severalyears of planning and the financial backing of the Seibudepartment store group. The result is a slice of Paris incentral Tokyo. Most of the school's interior furnishings andequipment, including the elegant chairs in the reception areaand the huge mirrors that give students an overhead view ofthe lessons, are identical to those used at the Paris schooland at its London and Ottawa branches.   Cooking materials and ingredients, many imported fromFrance, are as authentic as possible. &quot;It's taken us a longtime to find some of them, but now we are able to get theright ingredients at least three-quarters of the time,&quot; saysMr. Kopcsan.   Perhaps the most important ingredient in Le Cordon Bleu'sability to place graduates with some of the world's toprestaurants is its teaching staff. The head instructor isPatrick Martin, a chef who has won many culinary awards inhis native France, including the National Trophy of Cuisineand Pastry in 1987. In addition to supervising the other fourinstructors, Mr. Martin gives demonstrations for the SuperiorCuisine classes, the highest of the curriculum's threelevels.   At the first level, students learn how to prepareingredients, blend sauces and put together a few simpledishes, such as &quot;boeuf bourguignon&quot; and &quot;sole a la normande.&quot;Intermediate classes study the culinary differences among theFrench provinces, and focus on more elaborate dishes, such as&quot;baron de lapereau roti aux mirabelles,&quot; a rabbit dish withyellow plums from Northeast France. The Superior Cuisineclasses encompass everything under the gastronomic sun,including the style of a chef's preparation and presentation.   Mr. Sugimoto says Le Cordon Bleu classes in Tokyo andParis differ more in terms of atmosphere than of ability. &quot;InJapan there are more female students and, of course, nearlyall of them are Japanese, so the classes tend to be quieter,slower-paced and calmer then they might be in Paris, wherethe students come from all over the world,&quot; he says.   Mr. Martin notes that while nearly all Le Cordon Bleustudents in Paris aim to become professionals, the goals ofJapanese students are more diverse.   Some of the students study French cooking as a hobby. &quot;Icome here because I like French food, and it's more deliciousif you can prepare it yourself,&quot; says Hisao Saito, a salesassistant at an American securities company. &quot;Also, doing itcorrectly is something you can't learn from books.&quot;   Others, however, are making a serious professional effortto master things &quot;francais.&quot; One is Mikiko Kurumata, a youngcollege graduate from Fukushima prefecture, in Japan's northcountry. She attends both Le Cordon Bleu and AtheneeFrancais, a French language school here. &quot;I thought it wouldreally be tough, but I'm managing to keep up with thelessons,&quot; she says. &quot;I want to study at Le Cordon Bleu inParis and eventually open my own French cooking school.&quot;   When the Tokyo students leave the classroom and enterreal-world kitchens, whether in restaurants or at home, theywill not be able to reproduce exactly the recipes they havelearned at Le Cordon Bleu.   &quot;That is inevitable,&quot; Mr. Martin says. &quot;The raw materialshere are different. They will have to adapt to localconditions, but because they have mastered the techniques,they can be professionals who prepare dishes with real Frenchtaste.&quot;   Even the students who want only to impress their friendsapply themselves with diligence, writing down Mr. Sugimoto'severy word and taking photos of every dish.   Finally, however, the lesson draws to a close; thestudents sample their apple pastry as &quot;Chansons Dans le Cielde Paris&quot; wafts from the stereo system. The tape is from Mr.Sugimoto's collection. &quot;I play it to relax them and give thema taste of Paris,&quot; he says. &quot;After all, French cuisine ismore than technique.&quot;   ---   Mr. Schilling is a free-lance writer in Tokyo.</TEXT></DOC>
