(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A former Navy engineer today pleadedguilty to taking $475,000 in bribes from two defense contractors inreturn for providing confidential bid information about a computermaintenance contract.   Garland L. Tomlin Jr., 59, was among five people who enteredguilty pleas today in U.S. District Court in connection with theJustice Department's continuing investigation of Pentagonprocurement fraud.   Tomlin admitted receiving $400,000 from Sperry Inc. and $75,000from Honeywell Corp. between 1982 and 1984 while he was a branchhead at the Navy's Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command outsideWashington. The two companies were competing for work on acomputerized electronic maintenance system for the Navy.   Tomlin, who retired from the Navy and is now living in Florida,admitted that he received the payments that were funneled to anoffshore company he had set up in the Bahamas and later deposited ina Swiss bank account.   Another former Navy official, Jerry L. Manning, 52, pleadedguilty to a charge of conspiracy to commit bribery. Manning admittedthat in 1987 and 1988 he provided defense consultant Thomas Muldoonwith confidential bid information on a $20 million electronicscontract.   In return Muldoon had offered to pay him $1,000 a month, butprosecutors said they had no evidence that Manning ever received themoney. The government has not charged Muldoon, but according tocourt papers he was to try to sell the information he obtained fromManning to companies that were bidding on the contract.   In addition, a former marketing manager for Sperry and itssuccessor, Unisys Corp., pleaded guilty to a conspiracy to evadecampaign financing laws governing political contributions to membersof Congress.   Dennis Mitchell admitted that he participated in a scheme toconceal illegal political contributions that were made by defenseconsultants to the campaigns of Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., chairman ofthe House Armed Services Committee, and two other House members.These people were then reimbursed by Sperry for consulting contracts.   Mitchell also admitted arranging donations to the campaigns ofRep. Robert A. Roe, D-N.J., and former Rep. Robert E. Badham,R-Calif., an Armed Services Committee member who retired last year.   In addition, two consultants who worked for Sperry pleaded guiltyin connection with the scheme to pay illegal campaign contributions.   Joseph S. Zuba, 67, pleaded guilty to conspiring to defraud theFederal Election Commission and to three related charges.   Gerard J. Scarano, 74, admitted aiding and abetting the filing ofa false statement in connection with a campaign contribution to thelate Rep. Bill Chappell, D-Fla.   There was no indication that the congressmen named in the chargesknew they were receiving illegal campaign donations.   U.S. District Judge Claude Hilton scheduled sentencing for Sept.29. Tomlin could receive up to 25 years in prison and fines totaling$130,000 for his guilty pleas to conspiracy, receiving a bribe andtax evasion.   All five defendants have agreed to cooperate with the continuinginvestigation of Pentagon procurement fraud, dubbed ``Operation IllWind'' by the FBI.   The Justice Department said Tomlin has returned more than$385,000 to the government.   The guilty pleas came four months after former Unisys Corp.executive Charles F. Gardner and one of Gardner's associates, JamesG. Neal, pleaded guilty. Tomlin's name first surfaced when Nealadmitted that he had funneled $400,000 in bribes to the former Navyofficial at Gardner's direction.   Outside the U.S. courthouse, U.S. Attorney Henry Hudson said thebroadening evidence of bribery of Pentagon officials by defensecontractors ``shows a disturbing pattern. That's part of what thiscase is all about.''</TEXT></DOC>
