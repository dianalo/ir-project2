(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The crash and fire that killed 27 peopleon a church bus probably would not have been prevented by aprotective cage around the vehicle's fuel tank, a state firemarshal reported Tuesday.   After examining fuel-tank cages on other buses, investigatorsconcluded ``the protective cage is to prevent the tank from beingtorn away during collision and not to protect it againstpuncture,'' the report said.   The report confirmed that the fire which engulfed the bus ownedby Radcliff First Assembly of God church was caused by gasolinegushing from a puncture, 2{ to 3 inches long, in the fuel tank.   The bus, carrying 67 people home from an outing at an Ohioamusement park, and a pickup truck going the wrong way collidednear Carrollton on Interstate 71 on May 14.   The truck driver, Larry Mahoney, 35, of Worthville, was drivingwhile drunk, authorities said. He was indicted Friday on 27 countsof murder _ one for each victim of the crash _ and pleaded innocent.   The puncture probably was caused by one of the bus' front leafsprings and the fuel tank was pushed 24 to 26 inches to the rear ofits normal position, the report said.   ``Given the location of the puncture with respect to where thecage would have been, it is doubtful ... that a protective cagewould have prevented the puncture of this particular tank in thisparticular incident,'' the report said.   The report said investigators could not pinpoint the source ofignition. But investigators confirmed that the bus' front door wasknocked from its mounts, blocking escape.   The 1977 Superior bus, bought by the church from a schoolsystem, was among the last models manufactured before fuel-tankcages became a federal requirement on school buses.   The fire marshal's report recommended escape-exit windows androof hatches in new and old buses. The state has ordered``pop-out'' emergency windows on new buses and recommended them forold ones, but decided against action on roof hatches.   The report's other recommendations included relocating fueltanks away from the side door of a bus; requiring emergency escapetraining for passengers who ride buses on daily or weeklyschedules; restricting use of flammable materials in seats; andimproved driver training.   Meanwhile, residents of Carroll County, where the accidentoccurred, on Monday turned over a petition to the county clerk,calling for a referendum Oct. 4 on banning liquor sales.   A group called Concerned Citizens for Better Life gathered 1,076signatures, more than twice the 509 needed for the alcohol salesreferendum. By Tuesday, Judge-Executive Robert Westrick had notverified the signatures.   A 1985 vote that let Carrollton businesses sell liquor by thedrink was decided by just 13 votes. </TEXT></DOC>
