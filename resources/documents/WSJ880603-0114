The trucking company also said its board plans to meet early next week to review acquisition offers, including the offer from Razorback Acquisition Corp. with an indicated value of $276 million, and other possibilities such as a restructuring.    In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, Arkansas Best's stock closed at $25.375, unchanged. Arkansas Best's announcement was made after the market closed.    Last month, Razorback raised its tender offer to $23 a share after Arkansas Best rejected an offer of $20 a share. Arkansas Best hasn't formally responded to the sweetened offer, which also includes an offer of $886.66 per $1,000 face amount for Arkansas Best's $50 million in convertible debentures.    Emanuel Pearlman, executive general partner of New York-based Gemini Partners L.P., one of the two investment groups which make up Razorback, said neither he nor his advisers had held discussions with Arkansas Best. The trucking company has been rumored to be considering a management-led buy-out, but won't comment on that possibility.    The other partner in Razorback is Transport Partners L.P., a limited partnership of developers William and Earl Mack of Rochelle Park, N.J. </TEXT></DOC>
