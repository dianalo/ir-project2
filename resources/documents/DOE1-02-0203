The availability of binary cycle technologyon a commercial scale will permit the future development of moderate-temperature(below 400{sup 0}F) geothermal reservoirs, which represent about 80%of the geothermal resources in the US. SDG andamp; E has developed Start-upand Testing Plans which will result in accurate and reliable plant andequipment performance data and accomplish the following Project objectives:determine the operational and performance characteristics of the HeberBinary Power Plant, its equipment, and the geothermal reservoir overa wide range of conditions; develop data bases for plant, equipment,and materials performance over the entire demonstration phase of theProject; confirm operation of plant systems and components in accordancewith design criteria; and determine the optimum operating conditionsfor this plant and gather design information for improvement in designsfor future plants. This paper presents an update on the current statusof systems start-up and testing at the plant and discuss the upcomingplanned testing activities. 5 figures.</TEXT></DOC>
