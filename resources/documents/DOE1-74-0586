Theatmosphere has been identified as the main receptor for these compounds.Nevertheless, the amount of aromatics reaching the aquatic environmentshould not be neglected, due to their toxicity on aquatic organisms.Therefore, the water quality criteria for these compounds were calculatedboth on the basis of published data and of the toxicological resultsobtained in this investigation, carried out on four aquatic organisms,representative of three different trophic levels.</TEXT></DOC>
