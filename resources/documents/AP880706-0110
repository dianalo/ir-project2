(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Two American Indians headed in differentdirections as they left jail five months after they were arrestedfor taking as many as 20 people hostage in a newspaper office.   Eddie Hatcher, 30, and Timothy Jacobs, 19, were freed under$100,000 unsecured bonds Tuesday and ordered not to set foot inRobeson County while awaiting trial, scheduled to start Monday.   ``I've seen murderers and rapists let out on bond right away,but they put us through hell for the last five months,'' Jacobs,19, said as he left the courthouse.   ``I'm glad to be out,'' Hatcher said. ``It feels good.''   U.S. Magistrate Charles McCotter indicated he was reluctant tofree the men, who are accused of taking hostages Feb. 1 at TheRobesonian newspaper in Lumberton.   But he said a ruling by the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appealslast week, which held that Hatcher and Jacobs had been denied atimely detention hearing after their arrest, gave him no choice.   Under the conditions McCotter set, Hatcher and Jacobs are tostay out of Robeson County, avoid all contact with governmentwitnesses, report daily by telephone to probation officers andreturn to the residences of court-approved ``custodians'' by 9 p.m.daily.   Hatcher will stay with an uncle in Winston-Salem while awaitingtrial.   Jacobs will live in Halifax County with a family friend.   Assistant U.S. Attorney John S. Bruce had asked McCotter to keepthe two in jail, but if that was not possible, to put them undervirtual house arrest. Bruce argued that the appeals court rulinghad only ordered a new hearing, and that the judges had notconsidered evidence relating to the seriousness of the crime.   Hatcher and Jacobs said they took over the newspaper office tobring attention to drug trafficking and racial injustices inRobeson County law enforcement.</TEXT></DOC>
