Estimates of the physicalsolubilities of hydrogen, steam and nitrogen in molten uranium dioxide,molten zirconium dioxide and and in molten aluminum oxide based on amodel involving holes in the liquid are presented. It is speculated thatchemical interactions may enhance the solubility of steam in molten uraniumdioxide. It is shown that effervescence accompanying isobaric quenchingof the melts could cause foaming of the melt. Isothermal depressurizationespecially of metallic melts could produce more vigorous disruption ofthe melt. 26 refs., 4 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
