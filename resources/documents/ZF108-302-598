(VolumeRendering) (technical)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Levoy, Marc.andM;</AUTHOR><TEXT><ABSTRACT>Many medical data visualization applications require thatgeometrically defined objects and sampled fields appear togetherin a single image.andP;  The problem of rendering mixtures ofpolygonally defined objects and sampled scalar functions of threespatial dimensions is examined.andP;  Usually the polygon and volumedata in such systems are converted into a common representation,which requires a binary classification of the volume data andleads to misclassification of some small features.andP;  A hybridrendering algorithm is presented that can be used to display bothtypes of data directly, preserving the original representationsand eliminating conversion artifacts in generated images.andP;  The newtechnique presented is based on volume rendering, which is used todisplay sampled fields by approximating the transmission of lightthrough a colored semitransparent volume.andM;</ABSTRACT></TEXT><DESCRIPT>Topic:     New TechniqueVolumeImage ProcessingMedical DiagnosisImaging TechnologyVisualizationAlgorithm AnalysisResearch and DevelopmentData ConversionThree-Dimensional GraphicsRay TracingTwo-Dimensional Graphics.andO;Feature:   illustrationchart.andO;Caption:   Overview of hybrid ray tracer for rendering polygon and volumedata.
