Onthe other side are a few long-time federal employees who,like most Americans, don't have the cash handy to fund$300-an-hour defense lawyers.   Several retired Central Intelligence Agency officials havebravely stepped into this financial breach between Congress'sIndependent Counsel Lawrence Walsh and his newest targets atCIA headquarters. The five former officials decided that Mr.Walsh's high handed prosecutorial tactics justify a legaldefense fund for their former colleagues. &quot;The issue is fairplay,&quot; said Richard Stolz, who retired last year as thethird-ranking CIA employee. &quot;There's no way that any of thesepeople can match what the independent counsel can bring tobear in terms of resources.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   That's for sure. Mr. Walsh's cost to taxpayers has passedthe $40 million mark. This doesn't include tens of millionsof dollars in indirect public expenditures, making this farand away the most expensive prosecution in history. Incontrast, the half dozen current and former intelligenceofficials Mr. Walsh has targeted get no legal help from theCIA despite the fact that none of them is accused ofpersonally profiting. The likely claim against Clair George,Duane Clarridge and others is that their official actssomehow violated the infamous Boland amendment, which Mr.Walsh has never bothered to take to court or prove wasconstitutional.   One reason to hope that this legal fund succeeds is thatMr. Walsh might actually have to prove his cases in courtinstead of coercing pleas to noncrimes. His latest victim tosuccumb to legal-fee pressure was the CIA's Alan Fiers Jr. Hepleaded guilty to the crime of failing to appear before acongressional committee, despite the fact he did appear. Hesimply could not afford to fight the charges.   Conviction by financial coercion has been Mr. Walsh'smodus operandi from the start. His first &quot;victory&quot; cameagainst Contra fundraisers Spitz Channell and Richard Miller.After facing costs of $60,000 just to meet Mr. Walsh'sdemands for photocopy, they pleaded to a tax violation.Unfortunately for Mr. Walsh, the IRS and Justice Departmentsquickly clarified that their fundraising was no crime.   Indeed, it looks as if Mr. Walsh will have lost everymajor case he brought against defendants who came up with themoney to hire lawyers to fight back. Ollie North raised fundsto hire the non-potted plants at Williams andamp; Connally. Thefederal appeals court in Washington, backed by the SupremeCourt, threw out Mr. North's convictions because of abuses byMr. Walsh. Chief among these was using evidence that wassupposed to be immunized. The same errors should lead to thereversal of John Poindexter's convictions.   No other prosecutor in the country has the unlimitedbudget against a few selected defendants that Congressbequeathes to Mr. Walsh in exchange for pursuing thecongressional goal of criminalizing policy differences withthe executive branch of government. In the process, Mr. Walshhas become Exhibit A against the idea of independentcounsels.   As a public service, herewith the address to help defendthe CIA officials from Prosecutor Walsh:   Legal Defense Fund   P.O. Box 309   Merrifield, Virginia 22116   Should you support Mr. Walsh, he needs no contributions.As a taxpayer, you're already covering whatever bills hesubmits, no questions asked.</TEXT></DOC>
