GSA has based all administrativedecisions underlying this rule on adequate information concerning the needfor, and consequences of, this rule; has determined that the potentialbenefits to society from this rule outweigh the potential costs and hasmaximized the net benefits; and has chosen the alternative approach involvingthe least cost to society. <T3>Background Information: </T3>Section 5724b of Subchapter II of Chapter57, title 5, United States Code, authorizes agencies to reimburse transferredemployees for the additional income tax liability they incur as a resultof certain moving expense reimbursements. Policies and procedures for thecalculation and payment of a relocation income tax (RIT) allowance arecontained in the FTR, Chapter 2, Part 11. This supplement contains thetax tables generated by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) specificallyfor use in calculating 1988 RIT allowance payments and clarifications inpolicy necessitated by the phased implementation of the Tax Reform Actof 1986. The basic procedures and formulas have not changed from thoseissued for the 1987 RIT allowance payments. <T3>Advice to agencies: </T3>a. The Tax Reform Act of 1986 changed themoving expense deduction from an above-the-line deduction to an itemizeddeduction. Employees will no longer be able to deduct moving expenses ifthey elect to take the standard deduction. However, the General ServicesAdministration and the IRS have determined that for calculating taxablereimbursements subject to the RIT allowance it is reasonable to assumethat employees receive the benefit of offsetting deductions either throughitemizing deductions or the increased standard deduction. Therefore, theRIT allowance shall be calculated as if the employee had itemized and claimedall allowable moving expense deductions. b. In addition, the 80 percent limitation on meal expense deductions doesnot affect the RIT allowance calculations. <T3>Explanation of changes: </T3>This supplement amends the FTR to includea Federal Tax Table for 1988, and Federal and State Tax Tables for 1987,and to update the examples shown for calculating the RIT allowance. A provisionis added to indicate that calculation of the RIT allowance is not affectedby an employee's choice between itemizing deductions or taking the standarddeduction. A new provision allows the entire WTA payment to be treatedas an excess payment if the employee fails to file a RIT allowance claimin a timely manner. The certification provisions are revised to requirethe spouse to sign the tax information statement if joint filing statusand spouse's income are claimed. Further, the examples in the regulationhave been updated to reflect the new tax rates. Examples of IRS forms 3903and 4782 contained in Figures 2-11.8b and 2-11.8c are deleted. Agenciesand employees should refer to IRS publication 521, ``Moving Expenses,''for guidance in using the new forms for the 1987 tax year. The entire textof Part 2-11 is reprinted for user convenience along with revised examplesand Federal and State tax tables for 1987 and 1988. Tax tables previouslyissued for prior tax years are not reprinted but should be retained inthe regulations.

Types of Moving Expenses or Allowances Covered and General LimitationsThe RLT allowance is by law limited as to the types of moving expensesthat can be covered. The law authorizes reimbursement of additional incometaxes resulting from certain moving expenses furnished in kind or for whichreimbursement or an allowance is provided to the transferred employee bythe Government. However, such moving expenses are covered by the RIT allowanceonly to the extent that they are (1) actually. paid or incurred, and (2)are not allowable as a moving expense deduction for tax purposes. The typesof expenses or allowances listed in a through i, below, are covered bythe RIT allowance within the limitations discussed. a. <T3>En route travel. </T3>Travel (including per diem) and transportationexpenses of the transferred employee and immediate family for en routetravel from the old official station to the new official station.

For the purposes of this regulation,an assigned sale occurs when an employee obtains a binding agreement forthe sale of his/her residence and assigns the inherent rights and obligationsof that agreement to a relocation company that is providing services undercontract with the employing agency. For example, if the employee incursan obligation to pay a specified broker's fee or real estate commissionunder the terms of the sales agreement, this obligation along with thesales agreement is assigned to the relocation company and may, upon paymentof the obligation by the relocation company, constitute income to the employee.(See FTR 2-12.7 entitled ``Income tax consequences of using relocationcompanies.'')

Exclusions From Coverage The provisions of this Part 11 are not applicable to the following: a. Any tax liability that may result from payments by the Government torelocation companies on behalf of employees transferred on or after November14, 1983, through October 11, 1984, other than the payments for those expensesspecified in 2-11.3i(1). b. Any tax liability incurred for local income taxes other than city incometax as a result of moving expense reimbursements for employees transferredon or after November 14, 1983, through October 11, 1984. (See definitionin 2-11.5b.) c. Any tax liability resulting from reimbursed expenses for any nontemporarystorage of household goods except as specifically provided for in 2-11.3c.d. Any tax liability resulting from paid or reimbursed expenses for shipmentof a privately owned automobile. e. Any tax liability resulting from an excess of reimbursed amounts overthe actual expense paid or incurred. For instance, if an employee's reimbursementfor the movement of household goods is based on the commuted rate scheduleand his/her actual moving expenses are less than the reimbursement, thetax liability resulting from the difference is not covered by the RIT allowance.(See 2-11.8c(2)(a).) f. Any tax liability resulting from an employee's decision not to deductmoving expenses for which a tax deduction is allowable under the InternalRevenue Code or appropriate State and local tax codes. (See 2-11.8b(1)and 2-11.8c(2).) 2-11.5. Definitions and discussion of terms  For purposes of this part, the following definitions will apply: a. <T3>State income tax. </T3>A tax, imposed by a State tax authority, thatis deductible for Federal income tax purposes as a State income tax undersection 164(a)(3) of the IRC. ``State'' means any one of the several Statesof the United States and the District of Columbia. b. <T3>Local income tax. </T3>A tax, imposed by a recognized city or countytax authority, that is deductible for Federal income tax purposes as alocal (city or county) income tax under section 164(a)(3) of the IRC; except,that for employees transferred on or after November 14, 1983, through October11, 1984, local income tax shall be construed to mean only city incometax. For purposes of this regulation: (1) ``City'' means any unit of general local government which is classifiedas a municipality by the  Bureau of the Census, or which is a town or townshipthat in the determination of the Secretary of the Treasury possesses powersand performs functions comparable to those associated with municipalities,is closely settled, and contains within its boundaries no incorporatedplaces as defined by the Bureau of the Census (31 CFR 215.2(b)(1)). (2) ``County'' means any unit of local general government which is classifiedas a county by the Bureau of the Census (31 CFR 215.2(e)).c. <T3>Covered moving expense reimbursements or covered reimbursements. </T3>Asused herein, these terms include those moving expenses listed in 2-11.3as being covered by the RIT allowance and which may be furnished in kind,or for which reimbursement or an allowance is provided by the Government.d. <T3>Covered taxable reimbursements. </T3>Covered moving expense reimbursementsminus the tax deductions allowable under the IRC and IRS regulations formoving expenses. (See determination in 2-11.8c.) e. <T3>Year 1 or reimbursement year. </T3>The calendar year in which reimbursementor payment for moving expenses is made to, or for, the employee under theprovisions of the FTR, Chapter 2. All or part of these reimbursements (see2-11.6) are reported to the IRS as income (wages, salary, or other compensation)to the employee for that tax year under the provisions of the IRC and IRSregulations, and are subject to Federal tax withholding. The withholdingtax allowance (WTA) (see 1, below) is calculated in Year 1, to cover theemployee's Federal tax withholding obligations each time covered movingexpense reimbursements are made that result in a Federal tax withholdingobligation. For purposes of this regulation, an advance of funds for anyof the covered moving expenses is not considered to be a reimbursementor a payment until the travel voucher settlement for such expenses takesplace. If an employee's reimbursement for moving expenses is spread overmore than one year, he/she will have more than one Year 1. f. <T3>Year 2. </T3>The calendar year in which a claim for the RIT allowanceis paid. (1) Generally, Year 2 will be the calendar year immediately following Year1 and in which the employee files a tax return reflecting his/her tax liabilityfor income received in Year 1. However, there may be instances where theemployee's claims submission and/or payment of the RIT allowance is delayedbeyond the calendar year immediately following Year 1. (Year 1 will alwaysbe the calendar year that reimbursements are received; see e, above.) Year2 will be the calendar year in which the RIT allowance is actually paid.(2) The RIT allowance is calculated in Year 2 and paid to cover the additionaltax liability (resulting from moving expense reimbursements received inYear 1) not covered by the WTA paid in Year 1. If an employee's coveredtaxable reimbursements are spread over more than one year, he/she willhave more than one Year 2. g. <T3>Federal withholding tax rate (FWTR). </T3>The tax rate applied to incrementalincome to determine the amount to be withheld for Federal income tax fromsalary or other compensation such as moving expense reimbursements. Becausemoving expense reimbursements constitute supplemental wages for Federalincome tax purposes, the 20 percent flat rate of withholding is generallyapplicable to such reimbursements. (See 2-11.7c.) Agencies should referto the Treasury Fiscal Requirements Manual, ITFRM 3-5000, and applicableIRS regulations for complete and up-to-date information on this subject.h. <T3>Earned income. </T3>For purposes of the RIT allowance, ``earned income''shall include only the gross compensation (salary, wages, or other compensationsuch as reimbursement for moving expenses and the related WTA (see n, below)and any RIT allowance (see m, below) paid for moving expense reimbursementin a prior year) that is reported as income on IRS Form W-2 for the employee(employee and spouse, if filing jointly), and if applicable, the net earnings(or loss) for self-employment income shown on Schedule SE of the IRS Form1040. Earned income may be from more than one source. (See 2-11.8d.) i. <T3>Marginal tax rate (MTR). </T3>The tax rate (for example 35 percent)applicable to a specific increment of income. The Federal and State marginaltax rates to be used in calculating the RIT allowance are provided in appendices2-11.A, B, and C. See 2-11.8e(3) for instructions on local marginal taxrate determinations. j. <T3>Combined marginal tax rate (CMTR). </T3>A single rate determined bycombining the applicable marginal tax rates for Federal, State, and localincome taxes, using the formulas provided in 2-11.8e(4). k. <T3>Gross-up. </T3>Payment for the estimated additional income tax liabilityincurred by an employee as a result of reimbursements or payments by theGovernment for the covered moving expense reimbursements listed in 2-11.3.l. <T3>Gross-up formulas. </T3>The formulas used to determine the amount ofthe gross-up for the WTA and the RIT allowance. The formulas used herein(see 2-11.7d and 2-11.8f) compensate the employee for the initial tax,the tax on tax, etc. Note that the WTA gross-up formula in 2-11.7d is differentthan the RIT gross-up formula prescribed in 2-11.8f. m. <T3>RIT allowance. </T3>The amount of payment computed and paid in Year2 to cover substantially all of the estimated additional tax liabilityincurred as a result of the covered moving expense reimbursements receivedin Year 1. n. <T3>Withholding tax allowance (WTA). </T3>The withholding tax allowance(WTA), paid in Year 1, covers the employee's Federal income tax withholdingliability on covered taxable reimbursements received in Year 1. The amountis computed by applying the withholding gross-up formula prescribed in2-11.7d (using the Federal withholding tax rate) each time that a Federalwithholding obligation is incurred on covered moving expense reimbursementsreceived in Year 1. Grossing-up the Federal withholding amount protectsthe employee from having to use part of his/her moving expense reimbursementto pay Federal withholding taxes. (See 2-11.7.) 2-11.6. Procedures in general. a. This regulation sets forth procedures for the computation and paymentof the RIT allowance and defines agency and employee responsibilities.This regulation does not require changes to those internal fiscal proceduresestablished by the individual agencies pursuant to IRS regulations, orthe Treasury Fiscal Requirements Manual, provided that the intents of thestatute authorizing the RIT allowance and this regulation are not disturbed. b. The total amount reimbursed or paid to the employee, or on his/her behalf,for travel, transportation, and other relocation expenses and allowancesis includable in the employee's gross income pursuant to the IRC and certainState or local government tax codes. Some moving expenses for which reimbursementsare received may be deducted from income by the employee as moving expensedeductions, subject to certain limitations prescribed by the IRS or pertinentState or local tax authorities. Reimbursements for nondeductible movingexpenses are subject to income tax. (See IRS Publication 521 entitled ``MovingExpenses'' and the appropriate State and local tax codes for detailed information.)c. Usually, if the employee is reimbursed for nondeductible moving expenses,the amount of these reimbursements is subject to withholding of Federalincome tax in accordance with IRS regulations at the time of reimbursement.Under existing fiscal procedures, the amount of the employee's withholdingobligation is usually deducted either from reimbursements for the movingexpenses at the time of reimbursement or from the employee's salary. (SeeTreasury Fiscal Requirements Manual for Federal Agencies.)d. Payment of a WTA established herein will offset deductions for the Federalincome tax withholding on moving expense reimbursements and on the WTAitself, from the employee's moving expense reimbursements or from salary.e. The total amount of the RIT allowance can be computed after the endof Year 1 as soon as the earned income level, income tax filing status,total covered taxable reimbursements, and the applicable marginal tax ratescan be determined. Employee claims for the RIT allowance should be submittedin accordance with this regulation and the employing agency's procedures.f. Procedures are prescribed in 2-11.7 and 2-11.8 for computation and paymentof the WTA and the RIT allowance. These procedures are built on existingfiscal procedures and IRS regulations regarding reporting of employee incomefrom reimbursements and withholding of taxes on supplemental wages. 2-11.7.<ITAG tagnum="89"> Procedures for determining the WTA in Year 1. </ITAG>a. <T3>General rules. </T3>The WTA is designed to cover only the employee'swithholding tax obligation for Federal income taxes on income resultingfrom covered moving expense reimbursements. (See definition in 2-11.5c.)Other withholding tax obligations, if any, such as for social securitytaxes or for State and/or local income taxes on income resulting from movingexpense reimbursements shall not be included in the calculation of theWTA payment. The amount of the WTA is equal to the Federal income tax withholdingobligation incurred by the employee on covered moving expense reimbursements(which are not offset by deductible moving expenses) and on the WTA itself.Each time covered moving expense reimbursements are paid to or on behalfof the employee, the WTA shall be calculated, accounted for, and reportedas provided in b through g, below. b. <T3>Determination of amount of reimbursement subject to withholding. </T3>UnderIRS regulations, income resulting from reimbursements for nondeductiblemoving expenses is subject to withholding of Federal income taxes. (SeeIRS Publication 521, ``Moving Expenses.'') There are some moving expenseswhich may be reimbursed but are not covered taxable reimbursements (seedefinition in 2-11.5d) for purposes of the WTA and RIT allowance calculations,such as nontemporary storage of household goods. (See exclusions in 2-11.4.)Therefore, the actual amount of the covered taxable reimbursements maybe different than the amount of nondeductible moving expenses subject toFederal income tax withholding. Because the difference in these amountsshould not be substantial, the amount of nondeductible moving expensessubject to Federal income tax withholding, as determined by the agencypursuant to IRS regulations, may be used in calculating the WTA. (Notethat the RIT calculation procedure in 2-11.8 requires determination ofcovered taxable reimbursements.) c. <T3>Determination of Federal withholding tax rate (FWTR). </T3>Becausemoving expense reimbursements constitute supplemental wages for Federalincome tax purposes, the 20 percent flat rate of withholding is generallyapplicable to income generated by such reimbursements. The 20 percent rateshould be used in calculating the WTA unless under an agency's internalfiscal (withholding) procedures a different withholding rate is used pursuantto IRS tax regulations. In such cases, the applicable withholding rateshall be substituted for the 20 percent rate in the calculation shown ind, below. d. <T3>Calculation of the WTA. </T3>The WTA is calculated by substitutingthe amounts determined in 2-11.7b and c, above, into the WTA gross-up formulashown below: <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>4,L1(0,0,0),b1,tp0,p8,8/1,g1,t1,aw,10,2,4,4</C> <H1>Formula: Y</H1><H1>=</H1><H1>X</H1><H2>1-X</H2><H1>(N)</H1><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG></ITAG> <ITAG tagnum="26">where: </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="24">Y=WTA </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="24">X=FWTR (generally, 20 percent) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="24">N=nondeductible moving expenses/ covered taxable reimbursements </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">Example: </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="24">If X=20 percent </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="24">N=$21,800 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="110"><C>4,L1(0,0,0),b1,tp0,p8,8/1,g1,t1,aw,6,2,9,10</C> <H1>Then Y</H1><H1>=</H1><H1>.20</H1><H2>1.00-.20</H2><H1>($21,800)</H1><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG></ITAG> <ITAG tagnum="24">Y=.25 ($21,800) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="24">Y=$5,450 </ITAG>e. <T3>WTA payment and employee agreement for repayment.</T3> (1) The WTAmay be calculated several times within Year 1 if reimbursements for movingexpenses are made on more than one travel voucher. Each time an employeeis reimbursed for moving expenses which are subject to Federal tax withholdingin accordance with the IRS regulations, the WTA will be calculated andpaid unless the employee fails to comply with the requirements in (2),below.(2) The employee shall be required to agree in writing to (a) repay anyexcess amount paid to him/her in Year 1 (see 2-11.8f(4) and 2-11.9b(3)),and (b) submit the required certified tax information and claim for his/herRIT allowance within a reasonable length of time (as determined by theagency) after the close of Year 1. Failure of the employee to comply withthis requirement will preclude the agency's payment of the WTA. The entireWTA will be considered an excess payment if the RIT allowance claim isnot submitted in a timely manner to settle the RIT allowance account. f. <T3>Determination of employee's withholding tax on WTA. </T3>Since theamount of the WTA is considered income to the employee, it is subject tothe same tax withholding requirements as all other moving expense reimbursements.See Treasury Fiscal Requirements Manual for Federal Agencies, Section 4080,Moving Expense Requirements, for withholding requirements. g. <T3>End of year reporting. </T3>At the end of the year, agencies generallyare required to issue IRS Form(s) W-2 for each employee showing total grosscompensation (including moving expense reimbursements) and the applicableamount of Federal taxes withheld. For tax reporting purposes, the WTA isto be treated as a moving expense reimbursement. The total amount of theemployee's WTA's paid during the year as well as the amount of moving expensereimbursements should be included as income on the employee's Form W-2.The Federal tax withhholding amount applicable to the moving expense reimbursementsand the WTA should also be included on the employee's Form W-2. The amountof the WTA's also will be furnished to the employee along with the amountof moving expenses reimbursements on IRS Form 47892 or another itemizedlisting provided for the employee's use in preparing his/her tax return.(see IRS regulations for further guidance) and in claiming the RIT allowanceas provided in 2-11.8. 2-11.8. <ITAG tagnum="89"/><T3>Rules and procedures for determining the RIT allowance in Year 2.</T3>a. <T3>Summary/overview of procedures. </T3>The RIT allowance will be calculatedand claimed in Year 2. (See definition in 2-11.5f.) This can be accomplished,as soon as the employee can determine earned income (as defined herein),income tax filing status, covered taxable reimbursements for year 1 (seedefinition in 2-11.5e) and the applicable marginal tax rates. The RIT allowanceis then calculated using the gross-up formular under procedures prescribedherein. Since the RIT allowance is considered income, appropriate withholdingtaxes on the RIT allowance are deducted and the balance constitutes thenet payment to the employee. Rules, procedures, examples, and prescribedtax tables for these calculations are provided in b through h, below, andin the figures and appendices to this Part 11. b. <T3>General rules and assumptions. </T3>(1) The procedures prescribed hereinfor calculations and payment of the RIT allowance are based on certainassumptions jointly developed by GSA and IRS, and tax tables developedby IRS. This approach avoides a potentially controversial and administrativelyburdensome procedure requiring the employee to furnish extensive documentation,such as certified copies of actual tax returns and reconstructed returns,in support of a claim for a RIT allowance payment. Specifically the followingassumptions have been made: (a) The employee will claim allowable moving expense deductions for thesame tax year in which the corresponding moving expense reimbursementsare included in income; (b) Changes to the IRC, applicable to the 1987 and subsequent tax years,require that allowable moving expense deductions must be taken as an itemizeddeduction from gross income rather than as an adjustment to gross incomeas in previous tax years. It is assumed that employees will receive thebenefit of allowable moving expense deductions to offset income eitherby itemizing their moving expense deductions or through the increased standarddeductions. (c) Prior to the Tax Reform Act of 1986, it was assumed that the employee's(and spouse's, if a joint return is filed) earned income, filing status,and CMTR determined for Year 1 (and used in determining the RIT allowancein Year 2) would remain the same or would not be substantially differentin the second and subsequent tax years. However, the Tax Reform act of1986 substantially changed the Federal tax rates. Until the transitionto the new tax rates is completed, it is necessary to compute a separateCMTR for Year 1 and for Year 2. (See e, below.) The forumla for calculatingany RIT allowances to be paid in 1988, which is unchanged from 1987, isshown in f, below. It is assumed that within the accuracy of the calculation,the State and local tax rates for Year 1 and Year 2 will remain the sameor will not be substantially different. Therefore, the State and localtax rates for Year 1 shall be used in calculating the CMTR for Year 2.(2) The prescribed procedures which yield an estimate of an employee'sadditional tax liability due to moving expense reimbursements are to beused uniformly. They are not to be adjusted to accomodate an employee'sunique circumstance which may differ from the assumed circumstances statedin (1), above. (3) An adjustment of the RIT allowance paid in Year 2 for the covered taxablereimbursements received in Year 1 is required if the tax information certifiedto on the RIT allowance claim is different than that shown on the actualFederal tax return filed with IRS for Year 1 or changed for any reasonafter filing of the tax return, so as to affect the CMTR's used in theRIT allowance calculation. (See 2-11.10 for claims procedures.c. <T3>Determination of covered taxable reimbursements. </T3>(1) Generally,the amount of the covered taxable reimbursements is the difference between(a) the amount of covered moving expense reimbursements for the allowanceslisted in 2-11.3 that was included in the employee's income in Year 1,and (b) the maximum amount of allowable moving expenses that may be claimedas a moving expense deduction by the employee on his/her Federal tax returnunder IRS tax regulations to offset the income resulting from moving expensereimbursements for Year 1. The covered taxable reimbursements will be determinedas if the employee had itemized and deducted all allowable moving expensedeductions. (See assumption made in 2-11.8b(1)(b).) If the employee isprecluded from claiming moving expense deductions because he/she does notmeet IRS requirements for the distance test, then the amount of coveredtaxable reimbursements is the same as the amount of covered moving expensereimbursements. (See 2-11.5d.)  (2) For purposes of calculating the RIT allowance, the following specialrules apply to the determination of moving expense deductions to offsetmoving expenses reimbursements reported as income:  (a) The total amount of reimbursement (which was reported as income) forthe expenses of en route travel for the employee and family (see 2-11.3a)and transportation (including up to 30 days temporary storage) of householdgoods (see 2-11.3b) to the new official station shall be used as a movingexpense deduction. (See also 2-11.4e and f.)  (b) The total amount of reimbursement for a househunting trip, temporaryquarters (up to 30 days at new station) and real estate transaction expenses(see 2-11.3e, f, g, and i), up to the maximum allowable deduction underIRS tax regulations, shall be used as a moving expense deduction. For example,an employee and spouse filing a joint return and residing in the same householdat the end of the tax year may deduct up to $3,000 for these expenses.(No more than $1,500 of the $3,000 may be claimed for a househunting tripand temporary quarters expenses combined.) If the employee was reimbursed$1,350 for a househunting trip and temporary quarters expenses and $9,000for real estate expenses, the moving expense deudctions would be $1,350for the househunting trip and temporary quarters expenses and $1,650 forreal estate expenses. If the employee's reimbursement was $1,850 for thehousehunting trip and temporary quarters expenses and $9,000 for real estateexpenses, the moving expense deductions would be $1,500 for the househuntingtrip and temporary quarters expenses and $1,500 for real estate expenses.If the employee had no reimbursement for a househunting trip and temporaryquarters, the full $3,000 would be applied to the $9,000 reimbursementfor real estate expenses. (See IRS Publication 521, ``Moving Expenses,''for these and other maximums which vary by situation and filing status.) (3) Procedures and examples are provided herein as if all moving expensereimbursements are received in one year with all moving expense deductionsapplied in that same year to arrive at the covered taxable reimbursements.However, when reimbursements span more than one year, the amount of coveredtaxable reimbursements must be determined separately for each reimbursementyear (Year 1). The maximum moving expense deductions apply to the entiremove. Under IRS tax regulations the employee has some discretion as towhen he/she claims these deductions (e.g., in the year of the move whenthe expense was paid or in the year of reimbursement, if these actionsdo not occur in the same year). However, for purposes of the RIT allowanceprocedures, the moving expense deductions will be applied in the year thatthe corresponding reimbursement is made. For example, if an employee incurredand was reimbursed $1,000 for a househunting trip and temporary quartersin 1986 and an additional $1,000 for temporary quarters in 1987, this employee,according to his/her particular situation and tax filing status, may deduct$1,500 of these expenses in moving expense deductions. In calculating theRIT allowance for 1986, $1,000 of the $1,500 deduction is used to offsetthe $1,000 reimbursement in 1986 resulting in zero covered taxable reimbursementsfor the househunting trip and temporary quarters for 1986. The remaining$500 (balance of the $1,500 not used in determining covered taxable reimbursementsfor 1986) will be used to offset the $1,000 temporary quarters reimbursementin 1987 (second Year 1), leaving $500 of the temporary quarters reimbursementas a covered taxable reimbursement for 1987.  (4) Although the WTA amount is included in income (see 2-11.7), it shallnot be included in the amount of covered taxable reimbursements. Underthe procedures and formulas established herein, the proper amount of theRIT allowance is calculated using the RIT gross-up formula with the WTAand any prior RIT allowance payments excluded from covered taxable reimbursements. (5) Agencies are cautioned that there may be moving expenses reimbursedto the employee that are not covered by the RIT allowance. (See exclusionsin 2-11.4; also see discussion in 2-11.7 regarding covered taxable reimbursementsversus nondeductible expenses.)  (6) An example showing how to calculate covered taxable reimbursementsis illustrated in Figure 2-11.8a. d. <T3>Determination of income level and filing status. </T3>In order to determinethe CMTR's needed to calculate the RIT allowance, the employee must determinethe appropriate amount of earned income (as prescribed herein) that wasor will be reported on his/her Federal tax return for the tax year in whichthe covered taxable reimbursements were received (Year 1). Such amountwill also include the spouse's earned income if a joint filing status isclaimed. For purposes of this regulation, appropriate earned income shallinclude only the amount of gross compensation reported on IRS Form(s) W-2,and, if applicable, the net earnings (or loss) from self-employment incomeas shown on Schedule SE of IRS Form 1040. (See 2-11.5h.) (Note that movingexpense reimbursements including the WTA amounts and any RIT allowancepaid for a prior Year 1 are to be included in earned income and shouldbe shown as income on the Form W-2; if they are not, other appropriatedocumentation shall be furnished by the agency.) (See 2-11.7g.) the amountof earned income as determined under this paragraph and the tax filingstatus (for example, from lines 1 through 5 on the 1987 IRS Form 1040)shall be contained in a certified statement on, or attached to, the voucherclaiming the RIT allowance. (See 2-11.10.) If a joint filing status isclaimed and the spouse's earned income is included, the spouse must signthe certified statement. If the spouse does not sign the statement, earnedincome will include only the employee's earned income and the RIT allowancewill be calculated on that basis. This condition will not apply if an employeeis allowed, under IRS rules, to file a joint return as a surviving spouse.e. <T3>Determination of the CMTR's. </T3>The gross-up formula used to calculatethe RIT allowance in f, below, requires the use of two CMTR's_one for Year1 in which reimbursements were received and the other for Year 2 in whichthe RIT allowance is paid. CMTR's are single tax rates calculated to representthe Federal, State, and/or local income tax rates applicable to the earnedincome determined in d, above, for Year 1. The CMTR's will be determinedas provided in (1) through (4), below. (1) <T3>Federal marginal tax rates. </T3>The Federal marginal tax rates forYear 1 and Year 2 are determined by using the income level and filing statusdetermined under 2-11.8d and contained in the certified statement by theemployee (or employee and spouse) on the RIT allowance claim, and applyingthe prescribed Federal tax table contained in appendices 2-11.A and C.For example, if the income level for the 1987 tax year (Year 1) was $65,000for a married employee filing a Federal joint return, the Federal marginaltax rate would be 35 percent for Year 1 (1987) (see appendix 2-11.A) and28 percent for Year 2 (1988) (see appendix 2-11.C). These rates would beused regardless of how much of the $65,000 was attributable to reimbursementfor the employee's relocation expenses. (Note that these marginal ratesare different from the withholding tax rate used for the WTA.) If the employeeincurs only Federal income tax (i.e., there are no State or local taxes),the Federal marginal tax rates determined from appendices 2-11.A and Care the CMTR's to be used in the RIT gross-up formula provided in 2-11.8f.In such cases, the provisions of (2) and (3), below, do not apply. (2) <T3>State marginal tax rate. </T3>(a) If the employee incurs an additionalState income tax (see definition in 2-11.5a) liability as a result of movingexpense reimbursements, the appropriate State tax table in appendix 2-11.Bis to be used to determine the applicable State marginal tax rate thatwill be substituted into the formula for determining the CMTR for bothYear 1 and Year 2. The appropriate State tax table will be the one thatcorresponds to the tax year in which the reimbursements are paid to theemployee (Year 1). The income level determined in 2-11.8d for Federal taxesshall be used to identify the appropriate income bracket in the State taxtable. The applicable State marginal tax rate is obtained from the selectedincome bracket column for the State where the employee is required to payState income tax on moving expense reimbursements. the tax rates shownin the table apply to all employees regardless of their filing status,except where a separate rate is shown for a single filing status. (b) The lowest income bracket shown in the State tax tables in appendix2-11.B is $20,000-$24,999. In cases where the employee's (employee's andspouse's, if filing jointly) earned income as determined under 2-11.8dis less than this income bracket, an appropriate State marginal tax rateshall be established by the employing agency from the applicable Statetax code or regulations issued pursuant thereto. Such State marginal taxrate shall be representative of the earned income level in question butin no case more than the marginal tax rate established in appendix 2-11.Bfor the $20,000-$24,999 income bracket for the particular State in whichan additional tax obligation has been incurred. (c) The prescribed State marginal tax rates generally are expressed asa <T3>percent of taxable income.</T3> However, if the applicable State marginaltax rate is stated as a <T3>percentage</T3> of the <T3>Federal income tax liability,</T3> the State tax rate must be convertedto a <T3>percent of taxable income</T3> to be used in the CMTR formulas in 2-11.8e(4).This is accomplished by multiplying the applicable Federal tax rate forYear 1 by the applicable State tax rate. For example, if the Federal taxrate is 35 percent for Year 1 and the State tax rate is 25 percent of the<T3>Federal income tax liability,</T3> the State tax rate stated as a <T3>percent of taxable income</T3> would be 8.75 percent. The State taxrate thus determined for Year 1 will be used in determining the CMTR forboth Year 1 and Year 2.(d) An employee may incur a State income tax liability on moving expensereimbursements in more than one State at the same or different marginaltax rates. Nevertheless, a single State marginal tax rate must be determinedfor use in the CMTR formulas in 2-11.8e(4). The following general rulesshall apply in determining the applicable single rate.(i) In the tax year during which the transfer actually takes place, theemployee may incur a State income tax obligation at both the old and newlocation. However, most moving expense reimbursements will be taxed atthe new location. However, most moving expense reimbursements will be taxedat the new location. Although the employee may receive some reimbursements(e.g., for a househunting trip) prior to the actual transfer which wouldbe credited as income at the old location, these types of expenses generallyare tax deductible and would not generate an additional State tax liabilityfor the employee. In addition, procedures inherent in the travel voucherreimbursement system tend to cause most reimbursements which may be taxableto occur after the actual transfer. Therefore, the State marginal tax ratedetermined under 2-11.8e(2) (a) through (c) for the new location will beused in the CMTR formulas.(ii) There may be other situations where the employee is subject to taxeson moving expense reimbursements in two States, for instance, in one Statebecause State residency and in another because a particular State taxesincome earned within its jurisdiction irrespective of whether the employeeis a resident. If the two States involved recognize such situations byallowing an adjustment or credit for taxes paid to the other State, theemployee's State marginal tax rate for the State where income tax on movingexpense reimbursements is actually paid will be determined and used inthe CMTR formulas. However, in those situations where there is in factdouble taxation on income from moving expense reimbursements and the taxesimposed by both States qualify as a State income tax (as defined in 2-11.5a),the sum of the State marginal tax rates for the two States as determinedunder 2-11.8e(2) (a) through (c) shall be used in the CMTR formulas.(3) <T3>Local marginal tax rate.</T3> Because of the impracticality of establishinga single marginal tax rate table for local income taxes that could be applieduniformly on a nationwide basis, appropriate local marginal tax rates shallbe determined as provided in (a) through (c), below.(a) If the employee incurs an additional local income tax (see definition2-11.5b) liability as a result of moving expense reimbursements, he/sheshall certify to such fact when claiming the RIT allowance (see certificationstatement in 2-11.10) by specifying the name of the locality imposing theincome tax and the applicable marginal tax rate determined from the actualmarginal tax rate table or schedule prescribed by the taxing locality.The marginal tax rate shall be the one applicable to the taxable incomeportion of the amount of earned income determined under 2-11.8d for theemployee (and spouse, if filing jointly). The same tax rate shall be usedin calculating the CMTR for both Year 1 and Year 2. The employing agencyshall establish procedures to determine whether the employee certifiedlocal marginal tax rate is appropriate for the employee's income leveland filing status and approve its use in the CMTR formulas. (See also 2-11.10b(2).)(b) If the local marginal tax rate is stated as a percentage of Federalor State income tax liability, such rate must be converted to a percentof taxable income for use in the CMTR formulas. This is accomplished bymultiplying the applicable Federal or State tax rate for Year 1 as determinedin 2-11.8e (1) or (2) by the applicable local tax rate. For example, ifthe State tax rate for Year 1 is 6 percent and the local tax rate is 50percent of State income tax liability, the local tax rate stated as a percentageof taxable income would be 3 percent. The local tax rate thus determinedfor Year 1 will be used in determining the CMTR for both Year 1 and Year2.(c) The situations described in 2-11.8e(2)(d) with respect to State incometaxes may also be encountered with local income taxes. If such situationsdo occur, the rules prescribed for determining the single State marginaltax rate shall also be applied to determine the single local marginal taxrate for use in the CMTR formulas.(4) <T3>Calculation of the CMTR's. </T3>As stated above, the gross-up formulafor calculating the RIT allowance requires the use of two CMTR's. However,the required CMTR's cannot be calculated by merely adding the Federal,State, and local marginal tax rates together because of the deductibilityof State and local income taxes from income for Federal income tax purposes.The State tax tables prescribed in appendix 2-11.B are designed to usethe same income amount as that determined for the Federal taxes, whichreflects, among other things, State and local tax deductions. The formulasprescribed below for calculating the CMTR's are designed to adjust theState and local tax rates to compensate for their deductibility from incomefor Federal tax purposes.(a) <T3>Calculation of the CMTR for Year 1. </T3>The following formula shallbe used to calculate the CMTR for Year 1.<ITAG tagnum="21">CMTR Formula: X=F+(1^F)S+(1^F)L</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="24">where: </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="24">X=CMTR for Year 1</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="24">F=Federal tax rate for Year 1</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="24">S=State tax rate for Year 1</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="24">L=local tax rate for Year 1</ITAG>(i) <T3>Federal, State, and local taxes incurred. </T3>If the employee incursFederal, State, and local income taxes on moving expense reimbursements,the CMTR formula may be solved as follows:<ITAG tagnum="26">Example:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">If:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="24">F=35 percent of income</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="24">S=6 percent of income</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="24">L=2 percent of income</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">Then:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="24">X=.35+(1.00^.35).06+(1.00^.35).02</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="24">X=.4020</ITAG>(ii) <T3>Federal and State income taxes only. </T3>If the employee incurs taxliability on moving expense reimbursements for Federal and State incometaxes but none for local income tax, the value of ``L'' is zero and theCMTR formula may be solved as follows:<ITAG tagnum="26">Example:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">If:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="24">F=35 percent of income</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="24">S=6 percent of income</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="24">L=Zero</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">Then:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="24">X=.35+(1.00^.35).06</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="24">X=.3890</ITAG>(iii) <T3>Federal and local income taxes only. </T3>If the employee incurs atax liability on moving expense reimbursements for Federal and local incometaxes but none for State income tax, the value of ``S'' is zero and theCMTR formula may be solved as follows:<ITAG tagnum="26">Example:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">If:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="24">F=35 percent of income</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="24">S=Zero</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="24">L=2 percent of income</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">Then:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="24">X=.35+(1.00^.35).02</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="24">X=.3630</ITAG>(b) <T3>Calculation of the CMTR for Year 2. </T3>The calculation of the CMTRfor Year 2 is the same as described in (a), above, for Year 1 except thatthe Federal tax rate for Year 2 is used in place of the Federal tax ratefor Year 1.

In cases wherethe taxability of moving expense reimbursements is not clear, an agencymay pay a RIT allowance which reflects only those State and local tax obligationsthat are clearly imposed under State and local tax law. Once the questionableState or local tax obligations are resolved, agencies may recompute theRIT allowance and make appropriate payment adjustments.c. <T3>Fraudulent claims. </T3>A claim against the United States is forfeitedif the claimant defrauds or attempts to defraud the Government in connectiontherewith (28 U.S.C. 2514). In addition, there are two criminal provisionsunder which severe penalties may be imposed on an employee who knowinglypresents a false, fictitious, or fraudulent claim against the United States(18 U.S.C. 287 and 1001). The employee's claim for payment of the RIT allowanceshall accurately reflect the facts involved in every instance so that anyviolation of these provisions will be avoided.2-11.11. Violation of service agreement.In the event the employee violates the terms of the service agreement requiredunder 2-1.5a(1), no part of the RIT allowance or the WTA will be paid,and any amounts paid prior to such violation shall be a debt due the UnitedStates until they are repaid by the employee.2-11.12.
