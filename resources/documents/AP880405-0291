But analysts were reluctant to draw firm conclusions about themarket's overall tone because trading volume remained among thelightest levels so far this year.   ``The overriding issue is that the volume is not particularlyconvincing, and that's leaving the market fairly directionless,''said Hugh Johnson, senior vice president at First Albany Corp.   Despite a firming dollar and stabilizing bond prices, there was``a lack of strong fundamentals to sustain a move in eitherdirection,'' he added.   Analysts said professional traders were the main players in themarket, with individual and institutional investors remaining onthe sidelines while they await clearer signals on state of theoverall economy.   Traders are more interested in capitalizing on short-termmovements, while investors typically take a longer-term view of themarket, noted Michael Metz, a market strategist at Oppenheimer andamp; Co.   ``This is one of those low-conviction markets where tradersdominate the arena,'' he said.
