Ranks Hovis McDougall PLC, a major British baker and food maker, acquired a 20.3% stake in Avana Group PLC, another British maker of food products, and made a share-swap offer for the rest of the company, valuing it at the equivalent of about $387 million. Avana quickly rejected the offer as &quot;wholly unwelcome&quot; and not in the best interests of shareholders. Morgan Grenfell is advising Ranks in the bid.    The bid is modest by the standards of recent years, but it takes on added significance because of the investigation into alleged illegal share manipulation by Guinness during its acquisition of Distillers Co. last year. The Guinness affair has chilled London's financial district, sparking calls in Parliament for tighter regulation of financial markets and arousing strong political opposition to large takeovers.    The bid by Ranks is the largest unfriendly offer since the government launched its Guinness inquiry at the start of December.    The contest will be a major test for Morgan Grenfell, bankers said. Morgan rode to prominence as the leading adviser in unfriendly takeover attempts of recent years, but its role as Guinness's adviser has forced the resignations of its chief executive officer, its head of corporate finance and its leading takeover strategist in the past five weeks.    The Ranks offer is &quot;either courageous or foolhardy,&quot; said a top corporate finance official at another British merchant bank. &quot;It doesn't seem a particularly fashionable thing to do.&quot;    Ranks acquired the 20.3% stake in Avana from Northern Foods PLC, another British food maker, for $75 million. It is offering 12 of its shares for every five remaining shares in Avana.    Based on Ranks's current stock price, the offer values Avana at $11.17 a share, or $387 million. Ranks also offered an alternative of $10.51 in cash for each of as many as 10 million of Avana's 34.9 million shares.    Avana surged on the news to as high as $10.77 before drifting back to close at $10.37. That was below the $11.17-a-share offering price but sharply above Thursday's close of $7.23.    Ranks's managing director, Stanley Metcalfe, said that the company had been looking for acquisitions for about six months and that Avana proved an ideal target as a well-run company in a similar business.    Avana's chairman, John Randall, promised to &quot;vigorously defend (against) this unwelcome approach.&quot; The group will base its defense on profit forecasts for the year ending March 31 and the following year, he said. &quot;People will be shocked and amazed&quot; at the forecasts, he added.    Analysts agreed that Avana was vulnerable to a bid on economic grounds, because it has underperformed the market for the past three or four years as growth slowed. Further, the two companies complement each other, they said.    But with the fallout from the Guinness probe, &quot;clearly the odds have moved in favor&quot; of the target company, said a corporate finance officer at one major merchant bank. Avana's Mr. Randall also noted the new political opposition to large mergers. &quot;This concentration (of industry) in ever fewer hands cannot be good,&quot; he said.    Analysts said the hefty premium that Ranks offered over Avana's share price reflected the clouded political atmosphere. &quot;They're going for the knockout,' said Michael Landymore, an analyst at the brokerage Henderson Crosthwaite Ltd. Ranks merely said its offer was &quot;fair.&quot;    The stakes for Morgan Grenfell also are high. In addition to Morgan's losing the three top officers in the Guinness fallout, one of Morgan's top clients, BTR PLC, failed in its attempt to acquire Pilkington Brothers PLC last month. Morgan needs a success badly to bolster its image, other merchant bankers said.    In Morgan's favor, bankers noted that this bid is fairly modest compared with the mergers of 1986, topped by Guinness's $3.8 billion Distillers acquisition. In addition, Avana has little public profile because most of its goods are sold under other parties' names.    This bid situation is &quot;not too bad&quot; a place for Morgan to seek to reassert itself, the corporate finance officer said.    Robert Shrager, the Morgan director handling the bid, said the merchant bank had advised Ranks that the &quot;climate was generally against . . . contested bids&quot; but that the company was convinced that commercial grounds favored a move.    &quot;Morgan Grenfell is pretty secondary to this,&quot; he said. &quot;It's the client who makes the bid. It's not Morgan Grenfell who makes the bid.&quot;    ---   Brewer Doesn't Expect Cuts   LONDON -- Guinness PLC's chairman, Sir Norman Macfarlane, said he doesn't expect the scandal that has enveloped the British brewer to lead to cutbacks.    Interviewed in the company's employee magazine, Sir Norman said: &quot;As for cutbacks and job losses, we do not anticipate having to take action because of issues arising from the present investigation.&quot;    Sir Norman added that he didn't see any need for further dismissals or resignations from the company. The Guinness board fired the former chairman, Ernest Saunders, and some of the people he had hired. </TEXT></DOC>
