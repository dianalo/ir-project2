Mark H. Cohen, executive vice president in the ABC Television Network Group, will leave July 1 to pursue other endeavors, possibly in TV production. &quot;I've seen the ups, I've seen the downs. It's time to do something different,&quot; said Mr. Cohen, who turns 56 this week.    Mr. Cohen, who reported to John B. Sias, group president, oversaw children's shows, daytime programs, early morning news and the finances of the entertainment group. He joined ABC in 1958 and had various jobs before becoming an executive vice president in 1985. His exit follows the planned retirement of Warren D. Schaub, senior vice president, leaving Mr. Sias alone at the top of the ABC network group. It hasn't been determined yet who will fill the two posts. </TEXT></DOC>
