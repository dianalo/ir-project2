Analysts said the stability in the Labor Department's ProducerPrice Index for the first time in eight months signifies a taperingoff of the effects of the summer drought, which had sent food pricesup 3.5 percent since May.   Wholesale food prices, led by large declines for fruits,vegetables, bakery products, pasta, beef and cooking oils, fell 0.1percent last month. That was their first decline since February, theLabor Department said.   Food prices had skyrocketed 1.2 percent in September.   Seasonally adjusted energy prices rose by 0.3 percent last monthafter falling by 3.3 percent in September. Following sharp declinesover the summer, natural gas rates jumped 4.6 percent last monthwhile gasoline prices held steady and home heating oil prices fell10.1 percent.   Wholesale prices for goods other than food and energy wereunchanged last month. Automobile, home appliance, drug andchildren's apparel prices fell. Prices rose for women's and men'sclothing, household furniture, cosmetics, alcoholic beverages andprescription drugs.   Before seasonal adjustments, the Labor Department's index forgoods one step short of the retail level rose 0.6 percent to 109.3,meaning that a hypothetical selection of goods costing $100 at thewholesale level in 1982 would have cost $109.30 last month.   That same marketbasket of goods would have cost $108.60 inSeptember and $107.70 a year ago.   The seasonal adjustment process is designed to removepredictable, periodic influences from the calculation of pricechanges.   Analysts said the difference between the seasonally adjustedprices and real ones was primarily connected with the introductionof 1989-model automobiles.   ``Because auto rebates (on 1988 models) were smaller than normalin September, price increases in October were less than seasonallyexpected,'' said Donald Ratajczak, head of economic forecasting atGeorgia State University in Atlanta. ``Also, price rebates beganalmost as soon as new vehicles reached dealers.''   Sticker prices on 1989 models were an average of 7.5 percentabove what the 1988 models were selling for in September, the LaborDepartment said.   But it put the value of quality changes such asgovernment-mandated passive restraints, new corrosion protection andimprovements in powertrains at $153.69 per vehicle, or 34.6 percentof the average $444.08 increase in price to dealers.   Including seasonal variations intended to spread the increaseassociated with new models across the year, new car prices werecalculated as falling 1.7 percent.   Alcoholic beverage prices rose 0.6 percent on the wholesale levellast month after declining by 0.3 percent in September. Women's andmen's apparel costs were up 0.1 percent and 0.2 percent respectivelywhile prices for children's clothing fell 0.3 percent after rising0.6 percent in the back-to-school buying month of September.   Prescription drug prices rose 0.4 percent and are now 9.3 percentabove what they were a year ago. Cosmetics rose 0.5 percent onOctober but are only 2.9 percent higher than for the same month in1987.   Household furniture prices rose 0.8 percent last month and are4.5 percent above what they were a year ago. Including a 0.5 percentdecline last month, wholesale prices for household appliances haverisen only 0.7 percent in the last year.   Overall, wholesale prices for finished goods other than food andenergy have risen 4.1 percent in the last 12 months, slightly lessthan a 4.5 percent increase in consumer prices over the same period.   Energy prices on the wholesale level have fallen 5.9 percent overthe year while food prices have risen a total of 4.5 percent, theLabor Department said. In all, wholesale prices are 2.9 percentabove what they were in October 1987.   Price declines of 9.2 percent for fruits, 1.9 percent forvegetables, 5.8 percent for pasta, 0.9 percent for fish, 4.0 percentfor cooking oils and 1.6 percent for beef and pork paced the 0.1percent drop overall in wholesale food prices last month.   Offsetting those large declines were increases of 1.9 percent forprocessed chickens, 8.0 percent for turkeys, 7.3 percent for eggsand 1.0 percent for canned fruits and vegetables.   Ratajczak said the lower beef and pork prices reflect unusuallylarge pre-frost slaughters because of high feed grain costs.   Prices for intermediate goods further back in the productionchain _ items such as plastic parts, cement, paints, fertilizers,lumber and chemicals _ also were flat in October but are 5.3 percenthigher than they were a year ago.   Raw material prices for crude products such as oil, agriculturalcommodities, scrap aluminium, iron ore and timber declined 0.1percent last month and are only 0.5 percent above what they were ayear ago, the department said.</TEXT></DOC>
