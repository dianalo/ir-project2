The Z-pinchplasma produced by PROTO II of Sandia National Laboratories, Albuquerque,New Mexico, was used as the source. The plasma generated total x-rayyields of as much as 40 kJ with up to 15 kJ in the neon-, hydrogen-,and helium-like resonance lines in nominal 20-ns pulses. Molybdenum-carbon,palladium-carbon, and tungsten-carbon metal multilayers were placed at50 and 150 cm from the plasma center. The multilayers were at nominalangels of 5{sup 0} and 10{sup 0} to diffract the neon resonance lines.The time-integated x-ray reflection of the metal multilayers was monitoredby x-ray film. Data for two separate shots were analyzed. For a pureneon gas shot at a power level of 420 TW, the reflectivity of the multilayerat 15 cm decayed rapidly with respect to the still-rising signal of themultilayer at 150 cm. The onset time of the decay corresponded to anintegrated dose of 5.27 J/cm{sup 2}. For a neon implosion onto a vanadium-dopedpolyacrylic acid foam target shot, detailed modeling was attempted. Thespectral flux was determined with data from 5 XRD channels and deconvolvedusing the code SHAZAM. The observed decay in reflectivity was assumedto correspond to the melting of the first tungsten layer.</TEXT></DOC>
