More than 300 people attended the ceremony for Anderson. Amongthem: Jesse Jackson, the Democratic presidential candidate; PeggySay, Anderson's sister; and the Revs. Lawrence Martin Jenco andBenjamin Weir, former hostages.   Other ceremonies for Anderson were held in Batavia, N.Y., whereMrs. Say lives, and Lorain, Ohio, Anderson's birthplace.   By coincidence, the third anniversary of Anderson's captivitycame as former White House aides Oliver L. North and JohnPoindexter were indicted for their role in selling weapons to Iranand sending the profits to the Nicaraguan Contras.   Jenco and Weir are two of the three Americans hostages releasedas a result of the weapons shipments to Iran. Both have said theywould have opposed selling arms to the radical government ofAyatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.   Anderson, 40, and at least some of the other eight Americanhostages are thought to be held by pro-Iranian groups in Lebanon.   Mrs. Say said that since the Iran-Contra affair was revealed _in November 1986 _ the Reagan administration, embarrassed by theepisode, has ignored the hostages. ``For the past year, silence,''she said.   Jackson blasted the administration for taking a passive role andpursuing what he called a flawed policy in the Middle East. ``Wemust be willing to make it happen,'' he said.   Jackson said he would go to Lebanon to talk with Anderson'scaptors, if they would identify themselves.   Sen. Daniel P. Moynihan, D-N.Y., said in a statement that he hasproposed a special envoy to deal with the hostages.   ``I will not accept the explanation that nothing can be done,''he said. ``Something must be done.''   The service at Holy Trinity Roman Catholic Church includedChristian and Moslem prayers, songs, a candle-lighting ceremony andpersonal reminiscences about Anderson. Children in the audiencedistributed olive leaves as a symbol of peace.   Many in the group were colleagues of Anderson's in Beirut wherehe served as the chief Middle East correspondent for The AssociatedPress.   The ceremony was arranged by The Journalists Committee to FreeTerry Anderson, a group dedicated to seeing him released, and NoGreater Love, a humanitarian organization that helps families ofhostages and victims of terrorism.   Don Mell, an AP photographer, recounted how Anderson ``had thelook of a man who knew he was doomed'' when he was kidnapped aftera game of tennis in West Beirut three years ago. ``The whole thingtook less than a minute,'' said Mell, who witnessed the abduction.   The State Department, meantime, reaffirmed administration policytoward the hostages.   ``We have made constant efforts to open a valid channel ofcommunications to the terrorists,'' department spokeswoman SondraMcCarty said. ``They have responded with unacceptable demandsconveyed through one-way channels such as videotapes given to newsagencies.''   The United States is willing to talk, but it will not makeconcessions, she said.</TEXT></DOC>
