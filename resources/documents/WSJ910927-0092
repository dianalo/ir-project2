Analysts who follow Westinghouse as well as people in thebanking industry said the charge could be as much as $900million. A company spokesman said, &quot;We've not made a decisionas to when we'll implement that or how much it'll be.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   Westinghouse seeks an amendment that would loosen certainrequirements under its financial covenants, such as the debtlevel the company can maintain as a share of its net worth.   The company, which acknowledged it sought approval for thechange in a letter to banks this month, said any charge underthe accounting-rule change wouldn't affect cash flow oroperating results. Still, one lender said a charge, ifabsorbed all at once, could wipe out a full quarter'sreported earnings.   The accounting rule, which was instituted by the FinancialAccounting Standards Board, requires companies to set up areserve for future retiree medical benefits, rather thandeduct them from reported profits each year when paid, as isnow generally done. All companies must adopt the rule by1993.   Last week, General Electric Co. said it would take aone-time charge of $1.8 billion against 1991 first-quarterearnings under the accounting-rule change. In March,International Business Machines Corp. took a one-time chargeof $2.3 billion as a result of the change.   Under the new rule, companies can take the charge all atonce or amortize it over 20 years. Westinghouse said ithasn't decided on a timetable for absorbing the charge. Thecompany's lenders have until today to approve the amendmentto a $1 billion revolving credit line led by Chase ManhattanCorp., a lender familiar with the situation said.   In addition to this non-cash charge, analysts sayWestinghouse may take a hefty cash charge by the end of theyear to shore up its troubled financial services unit. Thatunit, Westinghouse Credit, took a $975 million pretax chargeagainst fourth-quarter 1990 earnings as a result of problemreal estate loans and highly leveraged transactions. &quot;They'venot been able to dispose of real estate as quickly as they'dlike,&quot; said Richard Schmidt of Standard andamp; Poor's Corp.&quot;Clearly there are going to be more adjustments in reserves.&quot;   In late trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday,Westinghouse shares were quoted at $22.625, up 12.5 cents.</TEXT></DOC>
