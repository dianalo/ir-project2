Among the hundreds of government jobs up for grabs, the aerospace and data systems concern targeted 24 that it considered crucial. The list was called &quot;Must Wins.&quot; Ignoring the near-term risk of depleting earnings, Martin Marietta turned inward and invested heavily in research.    Today, Bethesda, Md.-based Martin Marietta has reached an enviable position. With all but two of the &quot;Must Wins&quot; awarded, it has garnered 50% of the contracts it targeted, representing about 65% of their total dollar value, surpassing the industry average of 28% in both categories. The most recent plums include designing a primary part of President Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative, known as Star Wars, as well as manufacturing an air defense system to track and destroy airplanes. In addition, General Electric Co. decided last month to launch 15 satellites on Martin Marietta's Titan III rocket, which appears to ensure the success of yet another significant business.    &quot;The company's on a roll,&quot; says Peter Aseritis, a vice president at Smith Barney, Harris Upham andamp; Co. &quot;It's fat city,&quot; adds Gerald Supple, an analyst at Wheat, First Securities Inc.    But Norman Augustine, Martin Marietta's vice chairman and chief executive officer, isn't pulling out the cigars and resting on his laurels. Instead, he sees tough times ahead in maintaining such admirable growth. The value of the company's total backlog of orders now stands at $10.8 billion. But the &quot;burn rate&quot; for that revenue comes to $2 million every 20 minutes, meaning the company will exhaust those contract sources within two years.    &quot;It's a sobering thought when you wake up in the morning,&quot; Mr. Augustine says.    Indeed, the challenges of prevailing in the competitive defense industry are many. The worst risk Martin Marietta faces is the Pentagon itself, which could lop off an already won contract or two, should federal spending tighten as anticipated. In addition, one major undecided contract that Martin Marietta currently is betting heavily on -- to replace the federal government's phone system -- is deeply mired in politics and scandal that have created delays and uncertainty. And accidents, like the explosion of the space shuttle Challenger in 1986, can unexpectedly shelve programs indefinitely.    Meanwhile, despite its victories, Martin Marietta is taking rather hard its recent failure to be named one of the prime contractors for construction of the space station. Not only had it spent a lot of time and money on its proposal, but the company believed it had mastered many of the challenges such a project posed.    &quot;It was a very big blow to us,&quot; Mr. Augustine says. &quot;It was something we did very well, and not to win (the job) was almost more painful than you can describe.&quot;    But many analysts believe the future of the space station is in such flux that it was the best contract to lose. For now, these analysts have overlooked potential risks, and Martin Marietta stock tops their recommended list for aerospace and defense contractors. The $10.8 billion backlog represents more than twice the company's $5.2 billion in sales last year. Coupling this with lower research costs, Mr. Aseritis, the Smith Barney analyst, estimates that Martin Marietta earnings for 1988 will reach $5 a share, compared with $4.25 in 1987.    Mr. Augustine confirms that the company will &quot;do better in 1988 than it did in 1987.&quot; He declines to be more specific.    The market has agreed with analysts. In recent weeks, since the announcements of the Star Wars and GE agreements, the market value of Martin Marietta shares has advanced more than 7%, closing yesterday at $46.125, down 75 cents, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. &quot;The company can do very little that is wrong,&quot; says Paul H. Nisbet, a vice president at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. He forecasts 20% earnings growth annually for the next five years.    Martin Marietta's successes have been won through a carefully planned, four-stage strategy that is only half over, according to Mr. Augustine. The first part consisted of a restructuring in the wake of Bendix Corp.'s unsuccessful attempt to take over Martin Marietta in 1981. Facing debt that represented 80% of capital, from its attempt to fight off Bendix by launching a tender offer for more than half of Bendix's stock, Martin Marietta sold its aluminum, cement and chemicals businesses. It focused on becoming a high-tech manufacturing and engineering company specializing in electronics and optics.    &quot;Bendix forced Martin Marietta to focus on what kind of company it wanted to be years before that was popular,&quot; Mr. Aseritis of Smith Barney says.    With its debt as a percentage of capital reduced -- it was 28% at the end of 1987 -- Martin Marietta in the second phase focused on winning contracts in its specialty areas. It proved particularly prescient at investing heavily in businesses that the Pentagon considered priority items. For example, early research in electronics paid off in the awarding last month of a $508 million contract to build the national test bed for the Star Wars program. At great expense, the company had already built a prototype of the computer complex at its Denver operations site, enabling it to show the government a working version of its proposal.    Martin Marietta had scored another victory when its Titan IV military launch vehicle was selected in 1985 as an alternate to the space shuttle. Shortly thereafter, when the shuttle exploded in January 1986, the Air Force turned to Martin Marietta. The company has committed to 23 launches and has indicated it wants an additional 25 over the next five years.    Meanwhile, the commercial launch business, which Martin Marietta harnessed to its earlier Titan III launch vehicle, also has benefited from the shuttle accident. Because the shuttle program had fallen so far behind, President Reagan initiated an effort to privatize the commercial launch business. Titan III will launch two satellites for the International Telecommunications Satellite Organization, known as Intelsat, and one each for General Motors Corp.'s Hughes Communications Inc. unit and the British Defense Ministry, in addition to the 15 for GE. A large number of proposals for Martin Marietta launch jobs remain under consideration by other companies, according to Gareth D. Flora, president of Martin Marietta Space Launch Systems.    Mr. Augustine, who is expected to succeed Thomas G. Pownall as chairman of Martin Marietta this spring, anticipates leaner Pentagon spending ahead and says fewer ships, tanks and airplanes will be built because of their high costs. As a result, he plans in the third stage of the company's strategy to focus on technology for upgrading current systems.    In the long run, and the fourth stage, Martin Marietta will continue to create technologies and materials, with emphasis on communications, Mr. Augustine says. He plans to keep the company involved in as many different projects as it can afford. Unlike other defense contractors that may specialize in one program, Martin Marietta will continue to require at least 10 separate projects to make up half of its business.    Mr. Augustine doesn't plan to rely on any single one of them. &quot;The defense industry,&quot; he says, &quot;is headed for some hard times.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
