The Federal Home Loan Bank Board reported Tuesday that 80 percentof the nation's 2,945 Sandamp;Ls experienced net withdrawals in January.The total, in one month, exceeded net withdrawals for all of 1988,which were $8.6 billion.   James Barth, the bank board's chief economist, said a preliminaryestimate shows withdrawals easing only slightly in February tobetween $8 billion and $9 billion.   Barth attributed the bulk of the withdrawals to the failure ofSandamp;Ls to keep pace with rising interest rates offered by competitors,principally money market mutual funds, which in January paidinterest 1.25 percentage points higher than Sandamp;L three-monthcertificates of deposit.   Ely said much of the Sandamp;L deposit runoff has been voluntary in thesense that thrift institutions could raise interest rates and drawin more money. But, sooner or later, Sandamp;Ls will be forced to offerhigher interest rates and as that happens, Sandamp;Ls losses, which lastyear were the worst since the Great Depression, will deepen, he said.   ``The industry is going to suffer in the same way it did in theearly 1980s (when interest rates soared above 20 percent) but not inthe same magnitude,'' he said.   The problem is that Sandamp;Ls are forced to increase the rates paid ondeposits faster than rates earned on loans.   Economist Paul Getman of The Wefa Group, a Bala Cynwyd, Pa.,forecasting firm, said Sandamp;Ls have been unable to raise deposit ratesbecause ``there is a fierce rate war going on in mortgage lending.''   ``Thrifts are pricing adjustable rate mortgages at near suicidallevels. If they start raising deposit rates, they're going to haveto raise mortgage rates ... and risk losing business. There's noeasy way out,'' he said.   Barth attributed another portion of the withdrawals to adeliberate strategy by regulators to shrink ailing institutions.However, he also acknowledged that some of the outflows were causedby confidence problems as publicity mounted about the condition ofthe industry.   In February, for instance, $1.3 billion of the withdrawalsoccurred at the 230 institutions targeted for immediate governmenttakeover under President Bush's plan for resolving the Sandamp;L crisis,he said.   In the weeks preceding announcement of the Bush plan on Feb. 6,news accounts focused on an administration trial balloon suggestingthat depositors would be asked to pay a fee to help bail out the Sandamp;Ldeposit insurance fund.   ``That sort of talk undoubtedly induced some people to believe,`Why keep deposits at thrifts?''' Barth said.   February marks the 10th consecutive month of outflows from Sandamp;Lsand the fourth month in a row of outflows in excess of $7 billion.They totaled $8.3 billion in December and $7.0 billion in November.From May through October, outflows totaled $9.4 billion.   That was offset by $16.2 billion in inflows during the first fourmonths of 1988 when investors pulled their money out of the volatilestock market and put it into federally insured institutions.   ``Through (most of) last year they lost deposits and they'regoing to lose deposits all through this year. That's not a sign ofconfidence as far as I'm concerned,'' Getman said.</TEXT></DOC>
