But now it is more likely to drive oil prices down thanup.</LP><TEXT>   Prices already have softened some on just the hint thatIraq's crude could begin flowing again intodelicately-balanced world oil markets. The U.S. futures priceof crude for September delivery dropped 69 cents to $21.48 abarrel last week as a result. Yesterday, the price ofSeptember crude fell a further 13 cents a barrel to settle at$21.35 on the New York Mercantile Exchange.   The latest price weakening came after Iraq's new requeststo the United Nations to allow it to export some oil to payfor food and medicines were followed by indications the Bushadministration might support a one-shot sale for humanitarianreasons. Although the U.N. Security Council still is studyingthe situation, doubts persist now that there will be anyeasing of the embargo for at least a month.   But whether it is months, or weeks, away, Iraq eventuallywill rejoin the world's oil exporters. When that happens,industry officials say, pricing volatility will return to oilmarkets, which have been surprisingly stable in the fivemonths since the Persian Gulf War ended. Also, many look fora revival of production quota issues in the Organization ofPetroleum Exporting Countries as Saudi Arabia and othersresist giving up customers taken from Iraq or reducingvolumes to make way for Iraqi oil.   &quot;The only way Iraq can sell oil in today's environment isto dangle an attractive price,&quot; says Lawrence Goldstein,president of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation inNew York. Also, he says, &quot;The problems faced by OPEC in thepast are likely to come back with a vengeance in 1992.&quot;   Saddam Hussein of Iraq is hardly a pricing moderate. Heused price cutting by Kuwait as an excuse to invade it. And,in July 1990, just before the Aug. 2 invasion, Iraq'spresident pressed OPEC toward a $7 increase in the referenceprice of $18 a barrel for its basket of seven crudes. WithIraqi troops poised on Kuwait's border, OPEC compromised on$21 a barrel, still its target.   But the Iraqis are considered to be among the world's moreastute oil traders, although their veteran marketing directorthis year became OPEC's deputy secretary-general. They havebeen known to cut prices in the past when competitionwarranted. Still, such discounts aren't likely to push alloil prices below current levels.   That is because oil prices had been expected to risesharply as sluggish petroleum demand turns around later thisyear. The usual seasonal upturn combined with economicrecovery in the industrial nations could boost demand forOPEC oil an estimated two million barrels a day in the fourthquarter. Iraqi exports could help fill the demand, withprices still rising but not as much.   The Oil Market Listener, a New York-based analysisservice, cites estimates of prices rising as much as $5 abarrel -- before taking into account Iraqi oil. That wouldput West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. benchmark crude, at $26a barrel. But most estimates suggest a WTI peak this year of$23 to $25 a barrel -- to be followed by sharp falloffs nextyear when post-winter demand eases.   The OPEC basket lags behind WTI about $2 a barrel andaveraged $18.51 last week. Absent a one-time U.N. sanctionedexport of Iraqi oil, Energy Security Analysis, which monitorsoil supplies world-wide, forecasts WTI at around $22 a barrelfor the next 30 days. &quot;For the fourth quarter, we areprojecting a WTI price of $25 a barrel,&quot; says Edward N.Krapels, president of the Washington-based firm, &quot;but,definitely, Iraqi oil could shave $2 a barrel off that.&quot;   Kuwait already has resumed exports but with little impacton the oil markets. The Norwegian tanker Thorness, first tocarry crude from the emirate since the Iraqi invasion, leftKuwait Sunday as expected with a cargo of two million barrelsfor Europe.   Hamoud Al-Rqobah, Kuwait's oil minister, told reportersthat output by Kuwait is now back up to more than 100,000barrels a day. That doesn't include the emirate's part of theproduction that has also resumed in the Neutral Zone. Outputthere -- shared equally by Kuwait and by Saudi Arabia -- isnow 200,000 barrels a day.   Kuwait was able to produce as much as two million barrelsa day before the Persian Gulf crisis began. But with firesextinguished in only one-third of the wells the departingIraqis set ablaze, Kuwait isn't expected to be much of afactor in world oil markets again for at least a year andprobably longer. &quot;Kuwait's announcement that it {loaded} itsfirst crude for export this week is widely regarded as moreof a somber ceremonial flag-waving endeavor as theanniversary of Iraq's invasion approaches than as a realisticcommercial venture,&quot; reports the London-based Energy Compass.   But the prospect of oil pouring out of Iraq is takenseriously. Iraq formerly produced more than three millionbarrels a day and was tied with Iran for the No. 2 positionin OPEC. It currently is producing some 400,000 barrels aday, mainly for domestic use although it is allowed to truck55,000 barrels a day to Jordan. The industry accepts reportsby Iraqi officials they can produce quickly as much as onemillion barrels a day more just for export and send it allthrough pipelines across Turkey as soon as the U.N. approves.</TEXT></DOC>
