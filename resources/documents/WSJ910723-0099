In coming weeks, the large brokerage firm will dole outpay envelopes with bonuses for the fiscal year ended June 30that are expected to average as much as 15% higher than ayear earlier, people familiar with the firm said.</LP><TEXT>   That's nothing to write home about. But considering thatthe firm's fiscal year just ended, Bear Stearns's employeeswill be the first on Wall Street to benefit from thesecurities industry's 1991 upturn. Unlike corporate America,investment bankers and other Wall Street professionals dependon bonuses for the bulk of their annual pay.   More broadly, the Bear Stearns numbers are the firstconcrete sign that bonuses at Wall Street securities firmshave recovered from a four-year slide. Last year's bonuspools to investment bankers, for instance, fell by an average40% from paltry 1989 levels.   But investment bankers and others shouldn't begin majorspending sprees with the expected proceeds just yet.   &quot;Bonuses will go up, but you won't see astronomicalincreases,&quot; said Joan Zimmerman, executive vice president ofGZ Stephens Inc., a New York executive search firm. &quot;Afterfour very difficult years, the industry won't go back to itsold habit of immediate gratification.&quot;   Bear Stearns declined to comment on bonus amounts. JamesCayne, Bear Stearns president and head of its compensationcommittee, said final bonus numbers will be thrashed outwithin the next week.   Said Alan &quot;Ace&quot; Greenberg, Bear Stearns chairman, &quot;I thinkeveryone will be happy -- but I always say that.&quot;   Some senior managing directors say they already heard wordof the pay raises, which will vary widely among operationalareas. The disparity exists partly because bonuses areallocated by department. So, even though investment bankersin the syndicate area prospered with the increase inunderwriting business, their pay will be dragged down becausecorporate-finance bankers suffered from the continued dearthof merger advisory work.   The long-awaited rise in bonuses comes on the heels of thebest back-to-back quarters for the securities industry sincebefore the 1987 stock market crash. Bear Stearns, for itspart, is expected to have made about $1.50 a share in itslatest fiscal year, up 36% from the $1.10 a year earlier,said James Hanbury, a brokerage analyst for Wertheim Schroderandamp; Co.   Ms. Zimmerman, the executive recruiter, said she expects abigger battle this year between Wall Street management andemployees over bonuses because of the industry's upturn.While securities firms' profits slumped in recent years,investment bankers were happy just to have jobs.   Now, with the industry recovering, many employees areexpecting fat bonuses again. But management still wants tocut costs. And cutting bonuses can save a lot for securitiesfirms; salaries and bonus typically represent as much as halftheir operating costs.   &quot;Wall Street's management now has the difficult task ofcreating a more reasonable connection between pay andperformance,&quot; Ms. Zimmerman said.</TEXT></DOC>
