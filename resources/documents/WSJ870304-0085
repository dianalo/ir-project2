Although the central bank's rumored selling of pounds for West German marks appeared to be effective, sending sterling lower, dealers said that the British currency still holds considerable investor interest and could rebound.    Meanwhile, against a backdrop of bad economic news, the U.S. dollar fell against most other major currencies as it continued its lethargic trading in a narrow band.    Sterling's sharp gains prior to yesterday's rumored intervention were partly caused by inaction in trading of dollars for West German marks in recent weeks, dealers said. The situation directed speculators' attention to higher-yielding currencies, such as the pound. The Australian and New Zealand currencies also have attracted new investor interest, dealers said.    Traders said the Bank of England's action was aimed at &quot;smoothing out&quot; sterling's latest exchange-rate swing. &quot;They fired a warning shot across the bow, and it was effective. The market took heed,&quot; said Robert Hatcher, vice president and corporate foreign exchange dealer at Barclays Bank Ltd., New York.    Mr. Hatcher said the rush of speculative interest in the pound may have worried the British government, which would prefer more stable exchange rates as it prepares to release its federal budget later this month. &quot;The problem is, when you have a lot of hot money moving into the sterling market like that, it can slide out of the country just as fast,&quot; he said. &quot;The last thing they want right now are currency gyrations.&quot;    In late New York trading, the pound stood at 2.8558 marks, down 0.6% from 2.8741 Monday, when the pound rose 1.7%. Sterling had climbed to more than 2.88 marks yesterday before the rumored intervention. Against the dollar, the pound slipped to $1.5610 from $1.5643.    Relatively higher British interest rates have attracted speculators to sterling during the recent dollar-mark doldrums.    Yields on three-month sterling Eurodeposits are almost five percentage points above similar dollar investments and more than six points higher than for three-month mark Eurodeposits.    Traders expect additional developments to benefit sterling. The British government's new budget is expected to be released March 17 and to call for tax cuts and lower public borrowing needs. The budget is seen as possibly enhancing the reelection chances of Britain's Conservative government, which would also help the pound.    &quot;Prospects for sterling still look better than on anything else,&quot; said Frank Pusateri, senior corporate trader at Bank of Boston. &quot;If they {the government} push the right buttons at the right time, that could make sterling look even more attractive.&quot;    Speculation that the Bank of England may also soon decrease its lending fee to financial institutions is also helping the pound indirectly, traders said. They said some investors are buying sterling to purchase British government bonds in the expectation that the value of those securities will rise following any interest-rate cut.    In other foreign-exchange trading yesterday, the dollar fell to 1.8295 marks from 1.8373 and to 153.56 Japanese yen from 153.70.    The dollar's decline came amid more weak economic statistics that confirmed the generally bearish climate for the currency but failed to shake it out of its narrow trading range. The government reported that U.S. leading economic indicators fell 1% and that single-family home sales dropped 6.8% in January.    In early trading in Tokyo Wednesday the dollar fell against the Japanese currency to 153.48 yen from 153.56 in New York yesterday afternoon.    On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for March delivery climbed $3.60 an ounce, to $407.20, in moderate trading. The estimated volume was 2.8 million ounces.    Gold was quoted at $406.45 an ounce in early trading Wednesday in Hong Kong.    ---                       CURRENCY RATES                         New York    Home Mkt.
