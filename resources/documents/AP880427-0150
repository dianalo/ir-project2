He said the NRA's position from the beginning was to ensurethat legislation did not ban currently possessed firearms and didnot ban firearms currently being imported into this country. Thecompromise achieves those goals, he said.   ``As long as we're not banning any handguns, I don't haveserious problems,'' said the NRA lobbyist.   The compromise requires that guns contain material that would beas detectable by metal detectors as 3.7 ounces of stainless steel.The gun could have less metal or a different kind of metal as longas it would be as detectable as the stainless-steel standard.   Baker said that ``I support it (the compromise) in principle,''but he said he had reservations about some details.   ``There still needs to be some minor tinkering,'' he said,adding that the NRA was offering a ``qualified endorsement'' of thecompromise.   Police organizations and gun-control advocates have insistedthat a minimum amount of metal be required in a gun to ensuredetection by the magnetometers used in airport and buildingsecurity systems.   The NRA has insisted that there should be nogovernment-established metal standard, only a general requirementthat any gun be detectable by existing equipment.   The compromise takes the law enforcement approach, and sets aminimum metallic standard.   Although differences over plastic gun legislation have triggereda new and ferocious gun-control fight in Congress, sponsors ofrival bills said Tuesday's breakthrough could be a unifying forcefor lawmakers on all sides.   Joseph A. Morris, director of the Justice Department's office ofliaison, confirmed the agreement and said he hoped ``everyone canclaim victory.''   Despite these optimistic comments, however, the general approachadopted in the compromise has been attacked bitterly in past NRAstatements as an attempt to take guns from law-abiding citizens.   Attorney General Edwin Meese III, who at first publicly backedthe NRA's legislative position, now is committed to the compromise,Morris said.   The differences in the rival bills have never beeninsurmountable, but they became magnified once the plastic gunissue became the vehicle for the latest debate over whether thegovernment should control handguns.   Almost lost in the bitter struggle was the fact that everyoneembroiled in the dispute expressed the same goal: making surepotential terrorist weapons of the future will never be smuggledonto airplanes or buildings with security requirements. Plasticguns are not yet in production in this country, but there isgeneral agreement the technology exists.   The gun control and police groups have argued that the NRAapproach would cause long delays in airports. They contended thatwithout a minimum metal requirement for the gun, magnetometers mustbe used at settings so sensitive that they would constantly triggeralarms.   The NRA has said that the minimum standards established inlegislation would have banned a number of small metal handguns nowmanufactured, and called one particular measure ``the first federalgun ban bill in America.''   In a fund-raising letter to its supporters just this month, theNRA said that bills with minimum metallic standards would ``grantunlimited power to government bureaucrats to ban millions more ofyour guns.''   However, those comments addressed bills with higher metalrequirements than the compromise between the administration and acoalition of 11 police groups _ the Law Enforcement SteeringCommittee.   Morris said no currently made gun would be banned under thecompromise language. The key provision would require that guns haveenough metal to trigger an alarm set to pick up 3.7 ounces ofstainless steel.   The NRA has supported a bill by Sen. Jim McClure, R-Idaho, whichwould ban undetectable plastic weapons without setting a minimumstandard. McClure's approach, however, says that weapons must bedetectable by existing magnetometers.   McClure, commenting on the compromise, said he believes theproposal brings all sides closer together, although he stoppedshort of an endorsement.   But he added that if it would not ban any existing guns, therewould be little substantive difference between the two measures.   ``What we were trying to make certain of is that this is adetection bill and not a confiscation bill,'' McClure said.</TEXT></DOC>
