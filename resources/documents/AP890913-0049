In a speech Tuesday night, Prince Hassan accused Israel of tryingto drive a wedge between Palestinian Arabs and the PalestineLiberation Organization, but he disavowed any Jordanian intention torepresent the Palestinians.   At a news conference earlier, Hassan dismissed as a ``pipedream''of some Israeli politicians the idea that Jordan would agree to adeal to resume control of the West Bank.   Speaking after meetings with President Bush and Secretary ofState James A. Baker III, the prince said Israel and the UnitedStates should accept the PLO as the legitimate representative of thePalestinians in negotiations.   He denounced Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's plan forelections among Palestinians on the West Bank and in Gaza, saying``the purpose is to drive a wedge between them and their recognizedleadership.''   Jordan controlled the West Bank from 1948 until 1967 while Egyptran Gaza. The two Arab countries lost the territories to Israel inthe 1967 Six-Day War.   Shamir's plan, which has U.S. support, is designed to haveelected Palestinians negotiate with Israel five years of localself-rule for the 1.4 million Palestinian inhabitants. Afterward,joined by Egypt and Jordan, they would negotiate an overallsettlement.   But Hassan said an agreement could only be arranged at aninternational that includes the PLO and the Soviet Union. ``Jordanwill not represent the Palestinian people at the conference. Norwill it negotiate the settlement of the Palestinian problem onbehalf of the PLO,'' he said.   He said Jordan was willing to attend as part of a mixeddelegation with Yasser Arafat's group. In the speech and at the newsconference, he referred to the PLO leader as ``President Arafat.''   Earlier Tuesday, the State Department gave cautious praise to aplan by Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak for Palestinian elections.But there was no indication whether Israel or the PLO would go along.   The plan by President Hosni Mubarak includes a demand that Israelaccept the idea it should trade land for peace. Negotiations for anoverall settlement of the Arab-Israeli dispute would be held threeto five years after limited Palestinian self-rule began.   Israeli Prime Minister Shamir has steered clear of any schemethat would commit Israel to relinquishing West Bank and Gazaterritory. The PLO, meanwhile, demands nothing less than statehood.   Baker is sounding out Mideast leaders about Mubarak's ideas. Hemet last week with Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin and onTuesday with Hassan. Mubarak is expected here within a few weeks andShamir in November.   ``We continue to encourage all parties to find ways to launch anIsraeli-Palestinian dialogue to discuss the Israeli electioninitiative,'' said Margaret Tutwiler, the State Departmentspokeswoman. ``To the extent these 10 points can be helpful, in thatregard we welcome Egypt's efforts.''   Other elements of Mubarak's proposal include permittingPalestinians who live in East Jerusalem to participate in theballoting and supervision of the voting by international observers.   At a news conference later, Hassan called Mubarak's proposalworthwhile, but said a settlement of the Arab-Israeli disputerequired an international peace conference.   ``We see the Egyptian proposals as a mechanism for holdingelections,'' he said.   Hassan met with Bush at the White House for about 15 minutes andtold reporters they discussed generalities.   ``I had the very moving impression of the president's personalconcern toward these developments,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
