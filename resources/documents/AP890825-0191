At least seven Indiana cities _ Hammond, Highland, Hobart,Chesterton, Carmel, LaPorte and Portage _ are trying to createlinear parks from unused railroad rights-of-way; the HoosierRails-to-Trails Council is lobbying Indianapolis officials to turnone into a trail through the city.   Most cities are short on the money to develop trails. In others,residents express concern about the effects of a surge inrecreational visitors. However, advocates say crime goes down andthe local economy improves when tourists flock to well-kept railtrails.   ``We're missing the boat financially,'' said Ed Paynter,treasurer of the Indianapolis group. ``We're missing the boatrecreationally.''   In 1916, the United States had the largest railroad system in theworld with more than 250,000 miles of track. As trucks, planes,buses and cars began to take over, railroads merged, consolidatedtheir routes and shut down.   Nationwide, railroads each year abandon more than 3,000 miles oftrack. The President's Commission on Americans Outdoors recommendedturning the corridors into paths for hiking, biking and horsebackriding. Congress last year passed the National Trails SystemImprovement Act, requiring the Interstate Commerce Commission andNational Park Service to encourage such conversion.   As of January, 32 states had created 2,700 miles of rail trailswith an average length of 13.3 miles, according to theRails-to-Trails Conservancy. The leaders include Wisconsin, with 18trails totaling 443 miles; Illinois, with 20 measuring 203 miles;and Ohio, with 11 totaling 142 miles.   In Indiana, more than 2,400 miles of tracks lie unused.   Highland leaders envision a 2{-mile trail cutting diagonallyacross the northwestern Indiana city, which has gained use of twoabandoned rights-of-way. The 200-foot-wide corridor is beingdeveloped piecemeal during a search for contractors willing to levelit in exchange for the materials there.   ``There is a market for that if you are willing to not do it allat once. To date it hasn't cost us anything, but all we have to showfor it is a half-mile section,'' said Parks and RecreationSuperintendent Frank N. DeAtley.   In Portage, planners wanting to use two abandoned railways _ theElgin, Joliet and Eastern and the Norfolk Southern _ to link fourparks are stalled in negotiations over price. The five-mile trailswould intersect in an ``X'' and allow residents to ride to all fourcorners of the northwestern city.   Carmel Mayor Dorothy Hancock wants to create a five-mile trailalong a Monon corridor that goes south into Indianapolis.Therailroad wants $965,000, but Hancock said, ``That's not anything wewould pay or think about paying.''   The city hopes to start next summer by opening a one-mile path.Meanwhile, attorneys are researching the railroad's title to therest of the corridor.   Hammond Mayor Thomas McDermott wants to develop 4{ miles of theErie Lackawanna into an urban trail that might eventually link thenorthwestern city to nearby Griffith and Chesterton.   ``We're encountering some heavy opposition by the Common Councilbecause they're not willing to put up any money to develop it,''said planner Valerie Dehner. ``They don't see it as an amenity or aneconomic tool, which it definitely can be.''   In Indianapolis, a coalition of 600 businesses and othersupporters have tried to persuade officials to create a trail in theMonon corridor that once carried people to Chicago. The city boughtit from CSX Transportation with an $800,000 loan from the Urban MassTransportation Administration. If it is used for mass transit within10 years, the city does not have to repay the money.   A trail would not meet that provision. Other options include ahigh-speed bus line, a monorail or an elevated train. A series ofpublic hearings will be held to determine the best use, said DaveArland, a spokesman for Mayor William Hudnut. ``We want thatcorridor to be used for whatever the majority of people want it tobe used for.''   That process can take years, and trail advocates are becomingimpatient.   ``It can be done. They all forget the process needs to becontinuously reactivated in their minds,'' said Allen Kress, aplanner with the Northwest Indiana Regional Planning Commission.``Trails are a long-time investment and a long-time commitment isneeded to them.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Aug. 30</NOTE></DOC>
