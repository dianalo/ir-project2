The MHTGR design depends heavily on dataand information developed during the past 25 years to support large HTGR(LHTGR) designs. The technology program focuses on MHTGR-specific operatingand accident conditions, and on validation of models and assumptionsdeveloped using LHTGR data. The technology program is briefly outlined,and a schedule is presented for completion of technology work which isconsistent with completion of a Final Safety Summary Analysis Report(FSSAR) by 1992.</TEXT></DOC>
