(Products).andO;Product:   Progress 6.0 (Data base management system).andO;Topic:     Relational DBMSEvaluation.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Progress revs up the RDBMS engine in Version 6andM;Progress Sofware has answered the call for heterogeneous network computingwith a massive revamp of its relational DBMS engine.andM;As a result, with Progress Version 6:andM;* Each session or application can connect 240 databases, each supporting upto 2,048 users simultaneously;andM;* Aan application can have its data distributed strategically among differentplatforms supporting different user interfaces;andM;* A Progress &quot;client' session has built-in and concurrent support for avariety of common network protocols such as TCP/IP, DECnet, NetBIOS, andSPX/IPX;andM;* The distribution and location of physical data is entirely transparent tothe user.andM;Naturally, this last creates special administrative circumstances withregards to database integrity and backup.andP;  Because of this, the ProgressVersion 6 architecture has been improved to use a two-phase commitarchitecture that provides data integrity during multidatabase transactions.andO;In addition, Version 6 databases can now be backed up incrementally orcompletely while they're still open for normal read/write processing.andM;Also new in Version 6andM;Also new with Version 6:andM;* The ability to access foreign database engines including Oracle and RMSwith full read/write access;andM;* Support for various X-based windowing systems such as MOTIF, Open Look,SCO's Open Desktop and DECWindow;andM;* A redesigned data dictionary (a key component of the database engine) withan improved user interface and features for controlling distributed andforeign databases;andM;* Facilities for implementing large read-only databases on popular CDROM andWORM devices.andM;As in previous editions, a &quot;server session' is required for each multiuserdatabase.andP;  Multiple and independent server sessions can be invoked frommultitasking Unix and OS/2 platforms, or databases can be distributed amongmultiple physical database servers.andP;  Even when databases are distributed, noone &quot;client' relies upon any single server to route requests.andP;  Therefore, thefailure of a server will not prevent users from accessing other databases.andM;Embedded SQL for C allows C developers to interface directly to a Progressdatabase.andP;  A dynamic SQL interface has also been added that will allowdevelopers of other applications such as spreadsheets to interface withProgress.andM;A common criticism of Progress on DOS-based LANs is the need for separatephysical (DOS-based) database servers for each multiuser Progress database.andO;This is in addition to a network file server.andP;  The distributed database andnetworking features of Version 6, however, provides a simple approach tointegrating multitasking Unix or OS/2 database servers within a LAN.andM;Missing from the wish listandM;Although Progress 6 is a rather complete 4GL development, several featurescould be added to the benefit of all, most notably a solid relational reportwriter.andM;Also, developers face a 64K-byte limit for each compiled Progress procedurefile.andP;  This means that a large-scale application will typically yield a largenumber of dependent (branched) procedures.andP;  Because of this, the absence ofan interactive debugger and common trace utilities are more noticeable thanin some other environments.andM;Furthermore, Progress lacks support for built-in variable-length text fields.andO;Most Progress programmers are adept at working around the problem.andM;Finally, although the language is visibly intuitive and well structured,there is a significant learning curve for anyone applying Progress tolarge-scale transaction-intensive environments.andP;  And because thedocumentation is structured in more of a reference fashion, most seniorProgress developers have experienced hidden performance and behavior traps.andM;New developers should absolutely expect to invest in added training, eitherdirectly from Progress or from an authorized third party.andP;  Overall, thelearning curve for a proficient programmer/developer new to the systemtypically spans six months to a year.andM;Seen in the future:andM;* Support for Rdb;andM;* Support for Microsoft Windows;andM;* Progress opening its gateway methodology to third-party developers forcooperative development of access channels.andM;Overall, users will find an exceptional balance of power between the ProgressDatabase Engine, the Progress 4GL and Progress Administrative and end-userTools.andP;  Progress is available in a runtime, a query runtime (allowingcompiling of read-only database procedures) and full Progress.andP;  Thedistributed-database features and network support are built into each productlevel.andP;  The Progress environment can provide an organization with importantdeployment options and leverage in application development.andP;  Furthermore, alarge variety of commercial horizontal and vertical Progress-basedapplications are available through an international network of qualifiedProgress value-added resellers.andM;Adrian Sakashita is vice president and director of operations at IntegratedManagement Support Inc., Placentia, CA, an independent database integrationgroup with expertise in Progress 4GL/RDBMS.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
