Their comments came at a Senate Aviation subcommittee hearing, during which three senators warned that Congress might impose flight reductions during the busy summer-travel season, which begins Monday, if the FAA fails to take appropriate steps to protect air travelers.    &quot;The air-traffic control system in our busiest corridors cannot handle more traffic,&quot; asserted Sen. Frank Lautenberg (D., N.J.), chairman of the Transportation Appropriations Subcommittee. &quot;Until the system can, traffic in those corridors must be restricted.&quot;    The hearing focused on recommendations the safety board made to the FAA on May 13. Citing increases in errors by air-traffic controllers and pilot reports of midair near-collisions, the board urged the FAA to limit peak-hour flights at busy airports this summer.    Mr. Engen told the safety board on Wednesday that absolute limits on the number of flights currently aren't necessary, because the FAA already has ways to slow down traffic in areas that become congested. But he assured Commerce Committee Chairman Ernest Hollings (D., S.C.), that the FAA &quot;will restrict traffic if the time comes and it is necessary.&quot;    He added: &quot;As (traffic) levels go up, we will slow down that traffic as required.&quot; Indeed, he said such traffic slowdowns are one reason the number of flight delays already has increased.    Mr. Burnett testified that while he found Mr. Engen's remarks somewhat encouraging, he is still worried that the FAA won't act aggressively to reduce traffic in congested areas. He contended that excessive traffic already is causing &quot;a critical situation in many sectors&quot; of the country, adding that the FAA &quot;is trying to run the system up to the red line.&quot;    But when pressed repeatedly by Sen. John McCain (R., Ariz.) to name the &quot;critical&quot; areas, Mr. Burnett cited only Los Angeles and Chicago. He wouldn't name others, saying the safety board hasn't compiled a comprehensive list.    A major dispute between the safety board and the FAA centers on how to interpret midair near-collision reports, which rose last year, and controller errors, which increased in the first quarter but have declined in the current quarter. While the board cites the data as strong proof that safety is eroding, the FAA maintains there is no direct correlation between those figures and actual accidents.    But on another crucial point, Mr. Burnett and Mr. Engen may be closer than was previously thought. Many in Congress and the aviation community interpreted the board's recommendations to the FAA as a call for numerical quotas for flights at busy airports. But yesterday, Mr. Burnett denied that the board wanted specific quotas.    Rather, he said, the board wanted the FAA to stiffen its centralized flow-control procedures. Those procedures allow officials at headquarters to slow airline traffic around the country as needed. </TEXT></DOC>
