That represents an 11% rise from 1989, when companiesspent more money outside of the U.S. than in it for the firsttime. Overseas spending accounted for 53% of the total.Spending in the U.S. also rose in 1990, to $18.5 billion from$16.1 billion.</LP><TEXT>   The study was prepared by the accounting firm ArthurAndersen andamp; Co. and covered 239 publicly traded companies,mostly based in the U.S. The survey also included 15 Canadiancompanies and three major foreign companies with a large U.S.presence: British Petroleum Co., Royal Dutch/Shell Group andBroken Hill Proprietary.   The shift to overseas spending is expected to continue.&quot;For the next couple of years we'll see that trend,&quot;predicted Victor Burk, Arthur Andersen's managing director ofoil and gas. Particularly striking is that over the past fiveyears foreign spending has increased 58% while U.S. spendinghas risen just 8%.   In past years, the bulk of spending outside the U.S. camefrom major oil companies. But now smaller independents arestepping up their activity, the study found. &quot;We're doing alot of exploring around the world,&quot; agreed Charles Blackburn,chairman of Maxus Energy Corp. in Dallas. Maxus is activelyexploring or developing oil in more than a dozen countries.   &quot;To grow we had to be international,&quot; said JamesMcCormick, president of Oryx Energy Co., another Dallas-basedindependent. Last year Oryx acquired $1.1 billion ofreserves, mostly in the North Sea but also in Indonesia,Ecuador and Gabon.   One of the main reasons companies say they are searchingmore for oil outside the U.S. is because the most promisingareas for exploration, such as the Artic National WildlifeRefuge and certain offshore areas, are off limits.   &quot;The potential to find major new discoveries outside theU.S. is greater,&quot; Mr. Burk said.   While foreign spending probably will continue to increase,domestic spending will decline this year, Mr. Burk and otherspredict, because of falling natural-gas prices. Mr. Burkestimated U.S. spending could fall as low as $17.5 billionthis year.   With natural-gas prices as low as $1.10 per thousand cubicfeet on the Gulf Coast, at least 30 cents lower than mostpeople anticipated, companies have slashed their drillingbudgets. Cash-flow constraint is one reason, but there's agrowing feeling that gas prices might take years to recover.   The Arthur Andersen study also said that propertyacquisitions fell 45% last year to $4.9 billion. Mr. Burksuggested there has been a change in industry philosophy,with more companies believing they can find oil cheaper thanthey can buy it.</TEXT></DOC>
