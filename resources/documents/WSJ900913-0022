His announcement followed on the heels of the firststage of talks leading to a Mexican-U.S.-Canadian free-tradeagreement, which are moving much quicker than anyone imaginedwhen they were first announced. All this represents asignificant shift in Latin American thinking concerningeconomic development.   For decades, Latin American leaders were under the falseimpression that the best way to develop their economies wasto protect local industry from foreign competition. This ledto statist capitalism, which benefited a few well-placedindustrialists but left the vast majority of citizens cut offfrom the rest of the world. The industrialists got lazybecause they didn't have to compete with anyone -- includingtheir fellow countrymen -- and the products they manufacturedbecame inferior and over-priced. Uncompetitive islands ofeconomic and political instability resulted.</LP><TEXT>   It's a little early to say &quot;all that has changed.&quot; ButLatin leaders are now generally accepting the notion that ifthey integrate their economies with the rest of the world --this hemisphere in particular -- they stand a much betterchance of growing and of benefiting from foreign ideas andcapital. Recently Wall Street Journal editors asked fiveLatin American economic ministers their views on ahemispheric trade zone. Their responses:                                                                                                          COLOMBIA                                                                                                          Rudolf Hommes   Finance Minister:   President Bush's idea of creating a Western Hemispherefree-trade zone is of great importance. It is the firstconcrete proposal of the U.S. to promote the integration ofthe Americas based on trade, an important element of socialand political cohesion.   However, in analyzing this initiative it is necessary topoint out that since it is not entirely based on economicgrounds -- but is associated with the geopolitical relationsof power -- it can introduce new economic inefficiencies. Forexample, the economic integration with Latin American andCaribbean countries could lead to a specialization of theproductive basis of those countries that is determined by thecompetitive advantages that may exist with relation to theU.S. and Canadian economies, but could not necessarily existwith respect to the economies of the rest of the world.   The idea, in principle, is feasible, provided that theU.S. and its prospective Southern partners tame theirprotectionist instincts in order to make it work. This wouldseem plausible inasmuch as the international experience showsthat human well-being benefits from the effective practice offree trade.   In this sense, it is clear that Latin American leaders andtechnocrats are finally aware that protectionism is out modedand ruinous: The degree of protection given to localproduction is a measure of the inefficiency that a communityis willing to tolerate in detriment to its own well-being,and the economic development of the past 50 years in theLatin American countries has been delayed by a socialideology that has made them accept an outrageous level ofinefficiency for the sake of a vague but vehementnationalism.   As explained until now, the outline of the Bush initiativeseems to miss one element that would enhance these positiveexpectations. While it would seek the free market of goods,services, capital and technology within the free-trade areain the medium term, it avoids referring to the conditionsthat would permit what is essential for the success of anintegrated market: the free movement of people.   Another important aspect of President Bush's proposal isthe flexibility given to each country to choose betweenbilateral integration mechanisms and those that strengthensub-regional blocks. The same could be said with respect tothe freedom conferred to each country to choose their owntime frame for developing an agreement. However, free accessto the U.S. and Canadian markets is the common incentive thatwould move Latin American countries in either direction. Thissuggests that the bilateral option would be the most popularchoice.   A key to the success of the integration process is theequal treatment of and the non-discrimination amongparticipants, independent of the way in which they choose tojoin. It may be that the implementation of the initiativewill not occur in the context of GATT-like negotiations butthat a series of general principles will be clearly definedand will be compulsory for all participant members.Nevertheless, it is hoped that the principles established bythe U.S. government will not be the same it is trying toadvance in the Uruguay Round because our expectation is thatthis initiative would be more advantageous for Latin Americantrade.   Of course, this initiative will not comprehensively absorball bilateral issues. Colombia, for example, will be lookingbeyond it or even beyond the Andean Initiative to advance itsown bilateral agenda with the U.S.                                                                                                          MEXICO                                                                                                          Jaime Serra-Puche   Minister of Trade and Industry:   President Bush's initiative concerning a hemisphericfree-trade zone has caught the imagination of Latin America.The initiative will provide the means to complementadequately economies in order to facilitate a new era oftrade and investment relations -- as well as enhancingcooperation on scientific and technological issues. Freetrade is crucial in today's increasingly interdependentworld. The global economy requires active trade andinvestment flows so domestic economies can prosper and grow.Of course, trade agreements between developed and developingnations need to recognize their differences so that everyparticipant benefits fully from liberalized trade regimes.   Mexico's own structural change is based on a simplepremise: Mexico has to insert itself in the global economy.Mexico's international competitiveness requires adequatedomestic policies and proper external market access, so thecountry can benefit fully from international trade andinvestment flows.   On the one hand, domestic policies are consistent with theoutward orientation of the economy: Foreign investment hasbeen liberalized; non-tariff trade barriers have beendismantled; intellectual-property-rights legislation is underreview to assure the necessary protection to patents,licenses, trademarks and industrial secrets; and unnecessaryregulatory obstacles are being and will continue to beremoved. Overall, these policies have substantially enhancedthe competitiveness of Mexico's non-oil exports, which in thecourse of the past seven years have increased by a factor offour, surpassing the export performance of the most dynamiccountries during this period.   On the other hand, trade negotiations to assure externalmarket access are a crucial complement to domestic policy.With each region of the world, we are building strongereconomic relations, based on the principles of free trade.With the U.S., in particular, we have initiated preparatorytalks that will lead to the negotiation of a free-tradeagreement.   One important consequence of the free-trade agreementbetween Mexico and the U.S. will be the increasedcompetitiveness of the region vis-a-vis the rest of theworld. In sum, a free-trade agreement will complementMexico's internationalization strategy and it willsubstantially increase bilateral trade and investment flows.The benefits of such a pact will undoubtedly accrue to bothcountries, in terms of employment, efficiency andinternational competitiveness.                                                                                                          BRAZIL                                                                                                          Zelia Cardosa de Mello   Finance Minister:   The Brazilian government has been carrying out atremendous effort to reform the structure of its economy. Thenew foreign trade and industrial policies, which encompassthe gradual elimination of tariffs and trade barriers ingeneral, have facilitated a greater integration of theBrazilian economy with the world economy.   In this context, international cooperation is more thanwelcomed. We feel that to the extent that this cooperation isrenewed and expanded, Brazil will be able to react to it moreswiftly and more effectively.   The guidelines of the new U.S. free-trade initiative are apositive sign to Latin America as whole. They represent a newapproach of the U.S. government toward the region. We hope tobe able to explore in more detail the proposals made and toexamine ways and means to apply them for mutual benefit. Theytouch three points of fundamental importance: the debtquestion, the new investments in the region and the buildingup of an open trade market. By dealing with those threeessential matters they follow a path that we consider to bepotentially fruitful.   The feasibility of the proposals depends, at this stage,on the mechanisms of dialogue we may establish and, ofcourse, on the political will to carry them out.   Brazil has discussed the initiative with the governmentsof Argentina, Chile and Uruguay and intends to follow up thisdiscussion. The idea of sharing our views with those ofneighbor countries had the implicit purpose of giving aresponse re sulting from deep reflection and coordinatedviews. We are sure that the elements are given for the newsteps we all intend to take in our relations with the U.S.                                                                                                          CHILE                                                                                                          Alejandro Foxley   Minister of Finance:   There is a growing awareness throughout Latin America thathaving an open, trading economy is the surest path forpulling our economies out of the poverty trap. But an exportdrive can only succeed if it can secure export mar kets.Unfortunately, many countries of the world -- including theU.S. -- do not always reflect in their actions the free-tradegospel they preach. There is also the danger of having&quot;trading blocks&quot; develop, most notably in Europe and thePacific. Latin America is not beyond reproach either, havingallowed its regional trading arrangements to languish in thepast 20 years. I welcome President Bush's proposal as amuch-needed antidote to this dangerous world-wide tendency.It is now up to all countries in the hemisphere to moveswiftly and begin taking concrete steps.   A free-trade agreement in the Americas would ultimatelybenefit every country in the hemisphere, rich or poor. ForLatin America, greater openness would mean greater foreigncompetition. But it would also provide much-needed overseascustomers. I believe many of us are ready to take up thischallenge. At the same time, growing Latin American exportsto the U.S. and Canada would have as a counterpart a morestable and prosperous set of economies south of the RioGrande, among which Northern firms could also find promisingtrade and investment partners. There would be some temporaryadjustment costs, but the long-run mutual benefits are clear.The proposal therefore seems feasible. What is now needed isthe political will to move forward.   At this point it seems practical to proceed in stages.Those countries that are ready to open up their marketsshould start negotiations, whether bilaterally or in largergroups. Any concession made to the participants in the earlystages could also be extended to other countries that maydecide to join the process at a later date. Chile already haslow and uniform tariffs and no non-tariff barrierswhatsoever. We believe that is a helpful starting point fordiscussions with the U.S. or any other countries of theregion.                                                                                                          ARGENTINA                                                                                                          Antonio Erman Gonzalez   Minister of Economy:   We are enthusiastic about President Bush's proposal. Webelieve that economic integration is the most importantchallenge that the American nations have in this decade, andthe most effective method to compete in the world economy.Argentina wants to move forward toward this goal by pursuingthe following steps:   1) Achieve an agreement with the U.S. that will homogenizethe regulatory framework in both countries, allowing freemovement of capital; and   2) Establish a free-trade zone with Brazil and othercountries in the southern cone by 1994 so as to become a moremeaningful trading partner to integrate with North America.</TEXT></DOC>
