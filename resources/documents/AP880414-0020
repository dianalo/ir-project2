The companies named in the indictments are Marsh Aviation Co.,of Mesa, Ariz., and Beechcraft Vertrieb Und Service company ofMunich, West Germany, said U.S. Attorney Peter Nunez at a newsconference.   Marsh's owner, Floyd Stilwell, 61, of Phoenix, Ariz., wasarrested Wednesday in Phoenix and arraigned on charges ofexportation of defense articles, conspiracy to export items toIran, and making false statements to authorities, Nunez said.   Hans Schneider, 57, who owns Beechcraft Vertrieb Und Service, ischarged with conspiracy to export equipment to Iran, exportation ofdefense articles, and making false statements to authorities, hesaid.   The indictments were the result of an investigation prompted bya tip from Teledyne Ryan Electronics of San Diego and aided by twoWest Germans who have pleaded guilty to related charges, he said.   The charges against both companies and their owners stem fromthe alleged diversion of U.S.-made equipment from West Germany toIran, which shops around the world for military equipment for itswar with Iraq.   An export embargo on U.S.-made equipment was first placed onIran by President Carter during the height of the American hostagecrisis.   Stilwell allegedly submitted false export information toTeledyne Ryan, the U.S. State Department, and the U.S. CustomsService, in an attempt to conceal that the equipment's finaldestination was Iran.   Stilwell, who was arraigned in Phoenix on Wednesday, isscheduled to be extradited to San Diego to appear in court Monday.   The Sept. 25, 1987, indictment against Schneider accuses him ofdirecting his managing director, Bernd Pleuger, to continuenegotiating and servicing Iranian contracts with the illegaldiversion of equipment through their company.   Schneider's company sells service and distributes parts forBeechcraft Aircraft Corp. of Wichita, Kan., and other aircraft partmanufacturers.   Nunez said he doubted that Schneider will be extradited to standtrial in San Diego because the offenses he faces do not warrantextradition under the West German extradition treaty.   Pleuger, 51, of Stuttgarde, West Germany, and A. JuergenZimmermann, 37, of Augsberg, West Germany, have pleaded guilty toconspiracy charges in the case and have been cooperating in theinvestigation, Nunez said.</TEXT></DOC>
