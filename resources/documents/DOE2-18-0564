<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-18-0564 </DOCNO><TEXT>A study has been made of the production and decay of W {yields} e{nu}and Z {yields} e/sup +/e/sup -/, using the UA2 detector at the CERN p-barpCollider. The data correspond to an integrated luminosity of 142 nb/sup-1/ at a centre-of-mass collision energy {radical}s = 546 GeV, and 768nb/sup -1/ at {radical}s = 630 GeV. Measurements of the Standard Modelparameters from samples of 257 W decay and 39 Z decay candidates arecompared with expectations of the Standard Electroweak Model.</TEXT></DOC>
