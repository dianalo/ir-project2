Ministry spokesman Horacio Altamirano said the equipment includedspare parts for about 20 helicopters and 200 armored personnelcarriers.   The deal was signed Tuesday by Gen. Fred Woerner, chief of theU.S. Southern Strategic Command, and Argentina's army chief Gen.Francisco Gassino, Altamirano said.   The U.S. Embassy did not return phone calls for comment.   The aid is the first since Argentina and Britain clashed in 1982over the South Atlantic islands that Britain owns and calls theFalklands, and Argentina claims and calls the Malvinas. The UnitedStates supported Britain in the conflict.   Argentina's military budget has been cut in half to about 2percent of the gross domestic product since civilian President RaulAlfonsin took office in December 1983, ending a military regime thathad been in power for nearly eight years.   Officers have complained about not having enough money to draftand train recruits, fly jets or buy the parts needed to keepforeign-made equipment running, including M-113 armored personnelcarriers and Bell helicopters.   The lack of equipment and the low military budget in general wasone of the reasons cited by army rebels for an insurrection lastDecember.   Defense Minister Jose Horacio Jaunarena personally requested U.S.military assistance on a trip to Washington last October duringwhich he met with then-Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci.   U.S. military assistance to Argentina was sharply restrictedbeginning in the late 1970s because of human rights violationscommitted by the military regime trying to eradicate subversion.   The juntas bought the guns, planes and ships they wanted fromEuropean and Middle East suppliers.</TEXT></DOC>
