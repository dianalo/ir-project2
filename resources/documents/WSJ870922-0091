As previously reported, New York investor Bennett S. LeBow plans to buy New York-based ITT Corp.'s international telex business and merge it with Western Union. Holders of stock of record Sept. 16, including holders of seven of the company's eight issues of preferred stock, will vote on that combination at Western Union's annual meeting, which the company rescheduled for Oct. 30.    Mr. LeBow's complex plan also involves exchanging new preferred stock for $495 million in public and private debt, which consists of 12 issues of debentures and notes. The exchange offer, which is to expire Nov. 6, is for at least 80% of Western Union's debt.    The equity holders' vote will be tallied by an elaborate formula in which some classes also are weighted separately, and different classes require different approval levels.    In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, Western Union shares closed unchanged at $3.75. </TEXT></DOC>
