Wingrove 11/30/90 KOWLOON BAY, HONGKONG, 1990 NOV 30 (NB) -- One of the most astonishing aspects of life in theUS to an outside observer is the apparent willingness of individuals andcompanies to indulge in litigation at the drop of a hat.andP;  Nowhere is thismore true than in the information technology industry.andM;All too often the disputes appear quite frivolous, if not actuallymischievous, to the overseas audience.andP;  The impression one gets is that thoseinvolved are unable to distinguish between real life and some potboilingtelevision soap opera.andM;The only real beneficiaries of this over-willingness to take petty squabblesto court are the lawyers, and the ill-effects are frequently felt far andwide.andM;The companies resorting to absurd litigation would do much better to investthe vast sums of money involved in producing better, and better documented,products.andP;  There is not a single IT company that does not have room forimprovement in its support of the person who ultimately foots every bill -the end user.andM;At a time when strenuous efforts are being made to establish industry- wideopen standards for operations and communications, we are faced with theridiculous prospect of companies such as Lotus, Apple and others, attemptingto prevent the establishment of aspects of their own products as universalstandards.andM;Surely, the prestige and other benefits to be gained from having produced auser interface that others wish to emulate greatly outweigh the shortsighteddesire to make it exclusive? Companies that do not recognize the advantagesof being a de facto standard setter in a world where everybody else isstriving to achieve such standards, will inevitably find themselves followingthe dinosaurs into oblivion before long.andM;You do not have to know what is under the bonnet to be able to drive yourcar, but it is essential for you to be expert with the controls.andP;  If it wasnecessary to learn to use a different law-protected control system every timeyou got into the driving seat of a different make of car, the motor industryby now would have been long extinct.andM;Open Systems Interconnect (OSI), the Open Software Foundation, ElectronicDocument Interchange (EDI) and other bodies or schemes are the result ofefforts by untold thousands of people working for many companies large andsmall, themselves working cooperatively to the universal good.andM;So when will silly, parochial, selfish and ultimately doomed obstructivetactics, which only serve to threaten the wellbeing of an entire industry, beabandoned in favour of simple common sense?andM;(Norman Wingrove/19901113)</TEXT></DOC>
