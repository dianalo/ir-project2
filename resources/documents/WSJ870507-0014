Australian Gas is making an offer for all of TMOC Resources, an Australian natural resources company, which in turn controls Avalon, an oil and gas concern. TMOC Resources holds about 41% of Avalon's shares and has the right or the obligation under certain circumstances to purchase an additional 23%.    Avalon holds a 16% stake, or 9.8 million shares, in TMOC Resources, as well as 2.6 million TMOC Resources convertible notes. An Avalon spokeswoman said it hasn't been decided how many shares will be tendered, but said Avalon intends to remain a minority holder of TMOC.    Avalon said the Australian Gas offer of one share plus $1 cash for two TMOC shares or notes equals $5 for each TMOC Resources share. Australian Gas is an Australian industrial company with interests in gas distribution, pipelines, property development and finance.    The Australian Gas bid tops a $4-a-share cash offer by Santos Ltd., an Australian oil and gas exploration and production company, which isn't seeking to acquire the convertible notes. </TEXT></DOC>
