Also bikinis and evening gowns, sweaters and wristwatches.Even Barbara Bush wrapped herself in the flag -- a stars andstripes scarf -- at her husband's inauguration. And nobodyseemed to give a hoot.</LP><TEXT>   Times change, along with fashion. And Abbie Hoffman mustbe turning over in his grave.   Not so long ago, wearing clothes that looked like flags --or that were made from flags -- brought forth an immediateincendiary reaction.   The National Society Daughters of the American Revolutionforced a stars-and-stripes girdle off the market in 1965,calling it a &quot;shocking caricature&quot; of the flag. Three yearsafter that, Mr. Hoffman, the Yippie activist, was arrestedfor wearing an American flag shirt. The ensuing flap createda renegade fashion trend that has now returned in a morebenign, apolitical form, as designers pledge allegiance toOld Glory's bold graphics. What goes around comes around.   Why just a few days before the House of Representativeslast week voted down a proposed constitutional amendmentprohibiting the burning and desecration of the flag, SaksFifth Avenue, with patriotic zeal and in time for Flag DayJune 14, advertised a flag-patterned shirt: &quot;New Glory. Asalute to casual. . . .&quot; New York shoppers snapped up 50 ofthe shirts, at $57.50 each, the first day of the promotion.The shirt looks a lot like the Hoffman original.   Mr. Hoffman, after his arrest in 1968, wore the infamousapparel on &quot;The Merv Griffin Show&quot; and, in so doing, launchedthe fashion trend the first time around. TV viewers didn'tactually get to see the shirt because CBS blacked out thevideo just as Mr. Hoffman unzipped his jacket to show it off.The Vietnam War era censorship gave the shirt instant cachet,and impetus to sales of flag shirts across the land. It alsofirmly linked flag fashion with the counterculture. Kids woreflag patches on the seats of their jeans.   At least one flag-wearer had his day in court. In 1970, aCanadian named Valarie Goguen was arrested on Main street inLeominster, Mass., for wearing jeans that had a small U.S.flag sewed to the seat. At his arrest, Mr. Goguen insistedthat he hadn't intended to make a political statement. Heclaimed that he used a toy flag to patch a hole in his pants.But a jury convicted him of violating Massachusetts flag lawsand sentenced him to six months in jail.   Four years later, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned hisconviction, saying the Massachusetts law &quot;fails to drawreasonably clear lines between the kinds of nonceremonialtreatment that are criminal and those that are not.&quot;   &quot;The flag is a focus in this country for politicalexpression and social attitudes,&quot; says Whitney Smith, awell-known flag expert, or vexillologist, and director of theFlag Research Center in Winchester, Mass. &quot;When there is somenational crisis or celebration, people want to express thatsentiment,&quot; he says.   The flag is &quot;unabashedly red, white and blue, fervidlystarred and striped,&quot; said designer Donald Brooks during thefirst wave of flag fashion.   Now, more than two decades later, it's the establishmentthat plunks down $300 for Ralph Lauren's limited-editionsweaters with 23-star-flag replicas emblazoned across thechest. And Perry Ellis sells $2,000 cashmere stoles -- hugereplicas of the flag, but in gray, brown and beige. MarcJacobs, who designs for the label, has also used the OldGlory look on sequined dresses and says he does so withfeelings of reverence. &quot;It's a pride thing for me,&quot; he says.&quot;The American Flag is an icon, and I'm an American designer.&quot;   Today's fashion isn't protesting anything. Designers meanno disrespect, quite the contrary. And they haven't incurredthe wrath of the current anti-flag-burners even though theU.S. Flag Code of 1942, as amended, clearly states that theAmerican flag is not to be used as apparel, bedding ordrapery.   Congress last year passed the flag protection law thatthis spring was overturned by the Supreme Court. It definedthe thing to be protected as &quot;any flag of the United States,or any part thereof, made of any substance of any size, in aform that is commonly displayed.&quot; The definition didn'tcompletely eliminate the confusion that exists about when apiece of fabric is a flag to be protected and when it is atank top to be worn to the beach.   Fashion designers, no constitutional lawyers, clearlybelieve that they are within their rights to use flag motifs.Then, too, there's a general feeling that if you can burn theflag, you can surely wear one.   Even supporters of the ill-fated flag amendment aren'tsure where to draw the line. &quot;If someone takes two flags,sews them together and makes them into a poncho, we have aproblem with that,&quot; says John Minnick, a spokesman for theAmerican Legion.   But since most flag-fashion isn't made of real flags, Mr.Minnick doesn't generalize. &quot;I don't know, we'd have to seethe item of clothing first. . . . But if it is done in adisrespectful manner that holds the American flag up toridicule, I can tell you flat out we are opposed to that,&quot; hesays.   The DAR, which still distributes free copies of the flagcode, also isn't doctrinaire about flag fashion. Says theDAR's president-general, Marie Yokum: &quot;It's a sticky thingthat gets more complicated.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
