Renison argued in the supreme court of New South Wales that its operations in the South Pacific and possibly Australia would be at risk if Consolidated's 48% stake was taken over by Minorco, which has ties to a huge South African industrial empire. Last week, Papua New Guinea warned Renison it would have to sell its extensive gold activities in that country if South African interests acquired Consolidated.    Campbell Anderson, Renison's managing director, said separately that if Minorco's bid succeeds, Renison would seek to have the 48% stake sold, try to prevent dividend payments going to the new owner and seek to remove voting rights attached to the shares.    Minorco last month launched a #2.05 billion ($3.58 billion) bid for the 70.6% of Consolidated it didn't already own. It is expected to raise its offer once the current bid expires next Tuesday.    Minorco, based in Luxembourg, is 60.1%-owned by Anglo American Corp. of South Africa Ltd. and De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd., both controlled by South Africa's powerful Oppenheimer family. Shares issued under the bid would reduce the stake held by Anglo American and De Beers to a total of about 40.9%. </TEXT></DOC>
