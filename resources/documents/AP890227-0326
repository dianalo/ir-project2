(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A federal appeals court Monday upheld ajudgment against Sumitomo Electric Industries Ltd., which was foundto have infringed on two Corning Glass Works patents dealing withoptical fibers.   The ruling by the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals in Washingtonaffirms an October 1987 decision by U.S. District Judge William C.Conner, who decided all Sumitomo optical-waveguide fibers made orsold in the United States infringed on one or the other of twoCorning patents.   Payment of damages and other relief to Corning will be determinedin a separate proceeding by the district court.   Optical fibers are hair-thin strands of glass used to transmitinformation by light. They are used extensively in long-distancetelephone lines.   ``We believe this confirms the significance of the contributionthat Corning has made to this technology,'' said Corning's Jan H.Suwinski. ``Furthermore, the decision should be well-received byevery company that invests to create new technology.''   Sumitomo vice president Bob Swirbul said the decision in theappeal was disappointing to the company and ``different from ourexpectations.''   The company has been prohibited since 1987 from manufacturing orselling optical fiber strands but is allowed to sell fiber opticcable, which contains many strands, Swirbul said.   As such, he said, ``our current activities in our (fiber-optic)division ... will not be affected'' by the judgment.   Sumitomo's fiber-optic operations, which accounted for about 10percent of U.S. demand in 1987, are located in Research TrianglePark, N.C.</TEXT></DOC>
