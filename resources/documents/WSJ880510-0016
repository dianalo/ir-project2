The company said the purchase will lower the number of common shares outstanding by 3.2%, to about 86.8 million. Brunswick, of Skokie, Ill., has interests in marine power, boating, aerospace and defense.    Brunswick said the shares will be bought at below the current market price. In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, Brunswick's stock priceclosed at $22.125, down 37.5 cents.    Separately, Standard andamp; Poor's Corp. raised its rating on about $100 million of Brunswick's senior debt to single-A-minus from triple-B-plus.    The rating concern said the company had strengthened its balance sheet, partly by reducing by almost 40% debt related to its 1986 acquisitions of Bayliner Marine Corp. and Ray Industries Inc. Sandamp;P also cited Brunswick's strong earnings and cash-flow generation. </TEXT></DOC>
