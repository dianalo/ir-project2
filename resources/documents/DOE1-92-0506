The results indicate that the centre of the cityof Frankfurt has to cope with a pollution burden 3 to 5 times as highas the surrounding territory. The ratios of the 13 pollution componentsare largely identical at all sampling points. The leaf surface seemsto be the decisive morphological quantity determining the degree of contamination.To be sure, different plant species do sustain different pollution leadsper unit of weights, but the load per unit of leaf surface is largelythe same.
