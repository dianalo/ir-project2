Regulatory Flexibility Act</ITAG>DAC 86-16, Item IIThis item deletes coverage which has expired. Solicitation of public commentsis not required. The Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.)does not apply.DAC 86-16, Items III, V, VI, and VIIThese revisions are not ``significant revisions'' as defined in FAR 1.501-1;i.e., they do not alter the substantive meaning of any coverage in theDFARS having a significant effect beyond the internal operating proceduresof the issuing agencies. Accordingly, and consistent with section 1212of Pub. L. 98-525 and section 302 of Pub. L. 98-577 pertaining to publicationof proposed regulations, solicitation of agency and public views on theserevisions is not required. Since such solicitation is not required, theRegulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.) does not apply.DAC 86-16, Item IVThe coverage at Subpart 208.79 is not expected to have a significant impacton small businesses. It will impact only those small businesses that (1)manufacture antifriction bearings, or (2) use antifriction bearings ina subassembly, or end items sold to the DoD either directly or througha subcontract with a DoD contractor. Although there is no existing datato quantify the number of small businesses which may be impacted, it isestimated that only a small quantity will be affected. Further, becausethe restriction will be applied across the board giving the same advantagesand disadvantages to all, and because commercial items are exempted fromthe restriction, any impact is expected to be minimal. Therefore, an InitialRegulatory Flexibility Act Analysis has not been prepared. An interim rulewas published on August 4, 1988 (53 FR 29332) and comments were invited.DAC 86-16, Item VIIIThe rule does not appear to have a significant economic impact on a substantialnumber of small entities. When the interim rule was published on April16, 1987 (52 FR 12389), no comments were received concerning the RegulatoryFlexibility Act Statement that there would not be a significant impacton a substantial number of small entities. This rule affects only thosecontractors who supply to the Government machine tools not manufacturedin the United States or Canada. For these reasons, an initial regulatoryflexibility analysis has not been prepared. Comments from small entitiesconcerning the affected DoD FAR Supplement coverage will be considered.Please cite DAR Case 88-610D.The Department of Defense certifies that this rule will not have a significanteconomic impact on a substantial number of small entities within the meaningof the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601 et seq., because the revisionsdo not change the basic requirement for applying an evaluation factor.Comments were invited from small businesses and other interested partieson January 11, 1988 (53 FR 626).
