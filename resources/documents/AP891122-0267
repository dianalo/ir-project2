(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   New England's fishermen are a maverickbreed, happily isolated on the sea. But on shore their independencehas translated into an erratically regulated industry whose unionshave lost power.   From the family-owned vessel 300 miles out on the ocean to therubber-booted processors who make their way at dawn to this city'sfishhouses, the rules of the game are fairly loose.   Fishing is near the top of ``Most Dangerous Professions'' listsand the walls of The Seaman's Bethel here are lined with the namesof men lost at sea.   Federal inspectors keep tabs on product standards and the CoastGuard observes sanitary conditions on boats, but industrystatistics such as how many fishermen are injured on the jobannually are hard to come by.   Cramped boats bearing seven to 10 fishermen head out for twoweeks at a time, often under stormy, frigid conditions. Back onland, the predominantly female fish processors stand in one spotsometimes eight hours or more at a stretch, scaling, cleaning andpacking fillets.   ``The most frequent (accident) is the loss of fingers. A fingergoes zing and that's it,'' said Paul Swaim, a port agent andrecordkeeper for the National Oceanic and AtmosphericAdministration in New Bedford.   ``Accidents happen,'' he said. ``Slippery floors, knives and themachinery are pretty dangerous things.''   Perhaps as wearing as the fishing industry's inherent hazards isthe incalculable, wet and numbing monotony that is so much a partof the business.   Despite the conditions, New England's fishing unions have beenon the wane in the 1980s, broken in part by unsuccessful strikes inthe early part of the decade, said Harvey Mickelson, an attorneyfor the New Bedford's Seafood Dealer's Association.   Fish cutters and processors weakened themselves when they wenton strike in 1981, according to many in the fishing community.   Joe Testaverde, a Gloucester-based fisherman, said unions havenever had much muscle in his North Shore port. He said at most sixof the port's 100-plus boats were unionized.   ``Independence runs very strong in fishing,'' said Testaverde.``From my father's days to his father before him, fishermen havenever been much for unions.''   Ethnic traditions also have a lot to do with the resistance toorganized labor, Testaverde said. Italians, a substantialpopulation in Gloucester, have traditionally opted forkinship-based agreements rather than contracts with workers.   In New Bedford, the unions established by once-dominant Yankeefishermen have fallen away as the Portuguese population, whosefocus is on family rather than worker solidarity, has grown andtaken over much of the industry.   Family ties extend to onshore processing as well. Fishhousesemploy hundreds of women, many of them the daughters, sisters orcousins of veteran fish cutters and packers.   The women make about $6.70 an hour and although they'd like morethan the six or so holidays they get a year, the work is generallysteady, they said.   Henri Francois, who directs the 40-boat Seafarer's Union, saidseafarers and industry workers are becoming more union-oriented``because the fishermen are starting to think of retirement andhealth care.''   But Jim Costakes, who represents the port's boat owners,disagreed. He said less one-third of the fleet was unionized and hedoesn't expect the figure to change.   ``You've got a new generation in the industry who are moreinterested in what they can get now,'' he said. ``Their concernisn't for the pension in the future.''   That's right, said Jim Jardin, a champion scallop shucker andregular crew member based in New Bedford. He said fishermen areinterested in immediate benefits, of which he finds fewer thesedays.   Boat owners generally take 45 percent of the catch while thecrew splits the remaining 55 percent, Jardin said. Under unioninfluence three or four years ago, crews took an average 63percent, he said.   ``Sometimes (boat owners) can't make it on the catch alone, sothey have to make it up somewhere,'' the 25-year-old said. ``Thecrews usually swallow it these days.''</TEXT><NOTE>End adv Monday AMs Nov. 27</NOTE></DOC>
