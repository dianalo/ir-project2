It ispart of everyday life in the U.S. When this tradition dies,there will be no need for civil-rights laws favoring certainminorities.   America's system of justice in its plain, straightforward,historical and political sense has always meant preferentialtreatment for white people. Preferential treatment for a fewblacks is a recent phenomena in American life.</LP><TEXT>   Beginning with the appropriation of Indian lands and theenslavement of Africans, white Americans have been &quot;tradingon color, surname&quot; and &quot;other ethnic indicators.&quot; Whites arestill the largest recipients of preferential treatmentbecause they are the &quot;group currently in vogue.&quot;   A &quot;vast bureaucracy, inside and outside of governmentdepends for its economic lifeblood, its political clout andits psychic well-being on delivering perks to a constituency&quot;of white businesspersons. Nowhere is there a real challengeto these benefits for whites by the &quot;editorial allies&quot; ofpreferences for whites.   The majority of Americans own or control 99% of thenation's real resources acquired under preferential-treatmentpolicies for whites only. Preferential treatment is wrongonly when it applies to blacks and certain other minorities.   If the advocates against preferential treatment areseriously interested in eliminating such policies, they mustfirst eliminate the racially infested environment of unfairadvantages.   Phillip Rhodes   Detroit   ---   The article's thrust was that ethnicity should not be afactor in granting scholarships. The Department of Educationapparently created a brouhaha by suggesting that allprospective students applying for aid be treated equallyregardless of race or national origin.   How about going a radical step further -- givingscholarships for scholarship. As I read the article, therewill still be a &quot;need-based&quot; screening for most scholarshipmoney. How can a top 1% quarterback be given 30 to 40 offersof a full free ride, a top 1% swimmer 12 to 20, a top 1%volleyball star five to 10 but a top 1% scholar none? Thatphilosophy also means someone has decided the offspring ofthe improvident should be financed while the children of thesavers of the country are penalized. It further means that ifI work for a corporation with a generous pension plan andhave such large benefits that I do not need to provide for myown retirement and therefore do not save, my children have abetter shot at aid than my brother, self-employed, whoseretirement is his own responsibility and has accumulated$400,000 in assets, barely enough to match myoff-balance-sheet rights.   Ninety-seven percent of the money handed out in the nameof &quot;scholarship&quot; is really aid to the needy. While generositytoward our less fortunate neighbors is a national trait, it'stime to end the farce of calling the grants scholarships.   John G. Cornwell   Brookfield, Wis.</TEXT></DOC>
