The changing shapeof national politics together with Britain's apparent isolated positionin the international community on a number of environmental issues havecombined together to give rise to pressures for radical rethinking inadministrative circles on the efficacy of long-established practices.Key policy shifts that have already taken place, notably relating toagriculture, are considered, and it is suggested that there will be anincreasing move towards centralism in policy design. The results of currentdevelopments may well give rise to important changes in legislative andadministrative approaches, that have hitherto been seen as an essentialfeature of British environmental policy.</TEXT></DOC>
