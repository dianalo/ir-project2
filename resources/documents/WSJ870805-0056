The agreement, announced by USX last night, appeared to be an early strategy move in forthcoming national bargaining between the UMW and unionized coal companies. The UMW's three-year contract with the coal operators expires Feb. 1, 1988.    A union spokesman declined to comment on the agreement. USX officials couldn't be reached for comment at home.    The USX contract, affecting its USS Mining Co. unit, could encourage other operators to sign so-called &quot;me-too&quot; pacts. It follows recent similar agreements by Island Creek Coal Co. and Drummond Co.    The triennial UMW talks historically have yielded contracts that are quickly adopted by hundreds of smaller unionized companies.    But during the last round of bargaining in 1984, the coal operators' group began to fragment. Numerous large and midsize companies defected from the group, in hope of either of winning a better deal than BCOA members or averting a strike.    Coming negotiations on a new contract to succeed the 1984 agreement have prompted similar defections. Since April, at least 10 BCOA members are thought to have withdrawn, including the USX unit; the main coal unit of Bethlehem Steel Corp., Beth-Energy Mines Inc.; and Pittston Coal Group Inc., a group of several Pittston Co. coal units.    Some industry observers had speculated that the companies' recent flight from the BCOA signaled a concerted effort to negotiate steeper concessions from the union. However, the USX agreement, by committing the steelmaker to accept terms of the national pact, appears to dispel that theory.    Moreover, similar defections in 1984 didn't succeed in generating major contracts outside the national agreement. Lexington, Ky.-based Island Creek Coal dropped out but later signed the 1984 agreement after UMW miners ratified it.    Charles Gilliam Jr., a Charleston, W.Va., industry consultant, predicted that other companies will follow USX in signing me-too pacts. Most, though, will wait, he said, because the same offer &quot;will be available Jan. 31, so why do it now?&quot;    It's too early to say what USX's separate agreement with the UMW will mean. USX's agreement, coupled with recent BCOA defections, also leaves unclear whether the steel industry, a major producer and consumer of metallurgical coal, which is used in steelmaking, will have a representative on the BCOA negotiating committee.    Union sources suggested that the USX agreement provides an invitation to other coal companies to negotiate similar accords. Such pacts, they said, enable the union to rebuild its strike fund and similarly ease the strain in paying strike dues to members. The 1984 national pact was the first negotiated in 20 years without a strike.    Under the USX pact, the UMW agreed to continue working at USX mines in the event of a strike for current wages and benefits. USX agreed to pay retroactively any wage increase negotiated under a new national pact. </TEXT></DOC>
