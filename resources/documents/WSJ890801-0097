Tom Lantos (D., Calif.), chairman of the House Government Operations housing subcommittee. At a hearing, Mr. Lantos and other members of the panel focused on contradictions in the testimony of several witnesses who have appeared before the subcommittee, including former HUD Secretary Samuel Pierce, and in the 1987 congressional testimony of Mr. Pierce's powerful executive assistant Deborah Gore Dean.    In May, Mr. Pierce told the subcommittee that he didn't make funding decisions in a rent-subsidy program or overrule the recommendations of his staff. But in testimony before the Senate Banking Committee in 1987, Ms. Dean said that Mr. Pierce made all decisions in the so-called moderate rehabilitation program.    &quot;All funding decisions are made by the secretary,&quot; she testified. &quot;We do recommend to him areas of concern. Many times we are overruled.&quot;    Former Sen. William Proxmire (D., Wis.), who heard Ms. Dean's 1987 testimony and appeared as a witness said: &quot;Either he {Mr. Pierce} did not state the facts or she {Ms. Dean} did not.&quot;    Ms. Dean refused to testify before the subcommittee in June, citing her constitutional right against self-incrimination.    Mr. Pierce and Ms. Dean both have been unavailable for comment.    Another contradiction in testimony involved John Knapp, a former HUD general counsel, who recanted earlier statements made before the panel. Earlier, he indicated that he had issued an oral legal opinion that lifted competitive, &quot;fair-share&quot; requirements for allocating HUD's scarce rent subsidies. But yesterday, Mr. Knapp said he had never issued such an opinion and didn't know who, if anyone, might have.    Ms. Dean's influence over the allocation of moderate-rehabilitation funds greatly increased after the department stopped adhering to fair-share requirements, committee investigators and HUD documents disclose. Recently released HUD documents also show that in 1985, Mr. Knapp unsuccessfully sought a promotion to be HUD's undersecretary and that Ms. Dean lobbied for him.    Rep. Bruce Morrison (D., Conn.) suggested that HUD officials who circumvented competitive requirements without legal authority and instead used political considerations to award funds may have conspired to break the law. Mr. Knapp reluctantly agreed.    Lawmakers also were critical of former Federal Housing Commissioner Maurice Barksdale, another witness before the panel yesterday. They questioned whether Mr. Barksdale, after leaving HUD, should have lent $2,000 to a HUD deputy assistant secretary, Dubois Gilliam. Before the loan, Mr. Gilliam had dealt with a St. Louis housing project in which Mr. Barksdale's employer had an interest.    Mr. Gilliam, who is no longer at HUD, pleaded guilty in federal court here to accepting $8,100 in illegal gratuities and in a separate case, is under federal indictment in Biloxi, Miss., for allegedly using his influence to steer HUD grant money to a contractor in Jackson, Miss.    &quot;I agonized over it {the loan to Mr. Gilliam}&quot; Mr. Barksdale testified. &quot;In hindsight, perhaps it was not the correct thing to do.&quot;    Mr. Barksdale estimated that he has earned $300,000 as a consultant on nine HUD projects since leaving government. He was also rebuked for authorizing a recent fund-raising letter that was sent to local housing officials, urging them to contribute to the legal defense fund of another indicted former HUD official.    Mr. Knapp also came in for criticism. In 1985, the Office of Government Ethics assailed HUD's compliance with federal ethics laws, which came under Mr. Knapp's purview as general counsel. Rep. Charles Schumer (D., N.Y.) yesterday suggested that Mr. Knapp return part of his government salary because of his lax performance as his agency's ethics officer. &quot;I am disappointed at myself,&quot; Mr. Knapp conceded. </TEXT></DOC>
