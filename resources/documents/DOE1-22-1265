<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-22-1265 </DOCNO><TEXT>The poloidal field coils of ASDEX Upgrade consist of 5 ohmic heating coils,8 vertical field coils, and 6 control coils. The concepts of the coilswere dominated by problems of positioning the coils within limited spaceas close as possible to the plasma, problems of high voltage (max. 30kV) and high currents (max. 60 kA) giving current densities of max. 46.6x 10/sup 6/ A/m/sup 2/, and heating and cooling problems. The high voltagestrength of the insulation is achieved by using a vacuum-impregnated,glass-fibre and capton-reinforced resin. The results of several teststo measure the electrical and mechanical properties of the insulationare reported. The results of preliminary tests clarifying special manufacturingproblems and the manufacturing methods are described. Some fabricationsteps are treated in detail.</TEXT></DOC>
