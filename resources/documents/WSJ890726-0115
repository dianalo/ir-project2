The overall increase on the OTC market, however, contrasted with the recent declines in short interest on both the New York and American stock exchanges. On the Big Board, short interest dropped 8.35%; it slipped 0.89% on the Amex.    Although many analysts and investors are unsure about the outlook for stocks in computer-related industries, and prices of many of those issues have declined in recent weeks, short-selling of OTC technology stocks wasn't nearly as heavy as it was last year when similar conditions prevailed.    Michael Murphy, who edits newsletters on short-selling and on technology issues in San Francisco, said the reason is that short-sellers don't view the group as overpriced. &quot;The valuations just aren't excessive, compared to the rest of the market,&quot; Mr. Murphy said. &quot;So, even though the outlook may be shaky, {with} the stocks already down, the opportunity to make money on the short side is reduced.&quot;    Among the largest OTC issues, many of which are stocks of high-technology companies, short interest fell 0.7%. In the same period in 1988, it rose 5.9%. Stocks with big short-interest declines as of mid-July included technology issues Apple Computer, Intel, Sun Microsystems, McCaw Cellular Communications and Novell.    Typically, short-sellers bet that a stock's price will fall. They sell borrowed stock that eventually must be replaced, aiming to profit by replacing it with stock purchased later at a lower price. Short interest is the number of shares borrowed and sold but not yet replaced.    Nasdaq stocks that showed a surge in short interest included Daisy Systems, an engineering systems issue. Short interest in it rose 32.5%, or 449,201 shares, to 1.8 million shares. Digital Microwave, a microwave radio and fiber-optics concern, saw its short interest rise 267,229 shares, or 19%, to 1.7 million shares.    Short interest in First Executive, an insurer that is a large buyer of junk bonds, rose 35%, or 324,566 shares, to 1.3 million. Mr. Murphy said many short-sellers are flocking to issues of companies with ties to the junk bond market, including First Executive. Many analysts have said that if the economy goes into a recession, there could be a wave of defaults among these high-yield, high-risk debt issues.    Although heavy short-selling is generally regarded as a bearish sign for stocks, it can be interpreted more positively on the grounds that shorted shares must eventually be replaced through buying. In addition, changes in short interest in some stocks may be caused by arbitrage. For example, an investor may seek to profit during some merger situations by buying stock in one company involved and shorting the stock of the other.    The National Association of Securities Dealers, which operates the Nasdaq computer system on which 5,200 OTC issues trade, compiles short interest data in two categories: the approximately two-thirds and generally biggest of the Nasdaq stocks that trade on the National Market System and the one-third that aren't a part of the system.    The rise in OTC short interest in July resulted from a surge in short-selling of the smaller stocks. In non-NMS stocks, short interest in 1,335 of those issues totaled 47.2 million shares, compared with 44 million shares in 1,268 securities in June. This represents 1.31 days' average trading volume, compared with 1.11 days a month earlier.    Short interest in 2,406 National Market System securities totaled 173.2 million shares as of mid-July, down from 174.5 million shares in 2,390 issues in June. July short interest in these issues represents 1.94 days' average trading volume on the system for the reporting period, compared with 1.69 days the previous month.    The adjacent tables show the issues in which a short interest position of at least 50,000 shares existed as of July 14 or in which there was a short position change of at least 25,000 shares since June 15. </TEXT></DOC>
