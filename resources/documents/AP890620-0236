The proposed acquisition is subject to regulatory approval andChecchi faces a Sept. 18 deadline to complete the transaction. Ifthe deal collapses, NWA said, it would pay shareholders $70 cash ashare in a special dividend under a recapitalization, which wouldcost about $2.1 billion.   Kurt Rivard, an analyst for the brokerage Dain Bosworth Inc. ofMinneapolis, said the back-up plan could thwart a possible hostiletender offer for the nation's fourth-largest airline company becauseit would add unattractive debt to NWA.   In other recent takeover battles, including the bidding war forRJR Nabisco Inc., hostile offers were submitted after the companyannounced an end to the bidding.   Nabisco was ultimately purchased by the New York takeover firm ofKohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co., which has long been rumored as asuitor for NWA. Kohlberg Kravis has declined to comment on itsintentions involving NWA.   Malek said hostile bidding will be deterred because it would takea substantially higher offer for NWA to justify the expense ofreopening the auction, which spanned two months and included tworounds of bidding.   Conceding as much, Los Angeles oil billionaire Marvin Davis saidhe tentatively supports the deal between NWA and Checchi's group,Wings Holdings Inc.   Davis, who owns 2.9 percent of NWA's common shares, is one ofthree known suitors who were outbid by Checchi. The others were PanAm Corp. and Northwest's 20,000-member Machinists' union.   ``While disappointed by the outcome, I am pleased that the NWAspecial committee has elected to sell the company as we urged allalong,'' said Davis, who noted he was dropping his tender offer of$2.7 billion, or $90 a share, which set off the bidding process.   Pan Am issued a statement saying it was disappointed its bid wasnot chosen. The ailing carrier said that it wanted its offer to bereconsidered if the Checchi bid falters, and that the NWArecapitalization would be worth less to shareholders than the Pan Ambid. The airline has not disclosed the value of its offer.   Northwest unions welcomed Checchi's bid.   The International Association of Machinists said its first choicewould have been its own recapitalization offer. But ``we believethat Checchi has a good history of operating, and is not just anasset stripper,'' said Guy Cook, head of Northwest's IAM contingent,which represents 21,000 mechanics, clerks, ticket agents and baggagehandlers.   Rich Siakel, a spokesman for the Air Line Pilots Associationsaid, ``We like things he talks about, like a program for growth tostrengthen the airline.''   NWA said it chose Checchi's offer because it contained thehighest price, had the fewest contingencies and was the most likelyto succeed.   ``I think the likelihood of this deal going through looks ratherhigh,'' Rivard said. ``It's certainly a fair price and it was at thehigh end of the ranges that people were using.''   NWA stock soared $6.50 a share Monday to close at $114.12{ on theNew York Stock Exchange.   Checchi's proposal includes $700 million equity and $3.35 billionto be borrowed from a syndicate of banks led by Bankers Trust Co ofNew York.   Checchi's equity partners include KLM Royal Dutch Airlines;Bankers Trust; Richard C. Blum and Associates, a San Franciscomerchant banking and investment firm; and Elders Finance Group, asubsidiary of Elders IXL, an Australian investment company thatcounts a brewery among its holdings.   Checchi said he was not concerned about meeting financial fitnessrequirements of the U.S. Transportation Department. TransportationSecretary Samuel Skinner has said any leveraged buyout of Northwestwill be scrutinized to ensure that the carrier can operate safely inthe face of large takeover debts.   ``My feeling was that commercial banks are relativelyconservative, so whatever level of debt they are comfortable with,everyone should be comfortable with,'' said Checchi, 41.   Significantly, Checchi's plan does not call for the use ofhigh-yield, high-risk junk bonds, as do many takeover deals.Northwest's unions said they would oppose a takeover involving thistype of financing.   Checchi said his plan calls for ``substantial growth,'' includingthe purchase of 138 new planes already on order or option by NWA. Healso said he would retain current management and keep Northwest'sheadquarters in suburban Eagan. Malek said there would be nolayoffs, nor would any Northest assets be sold.   William Genoese, president of the airline division of theTeamsters union, said he would meet with Checchi's group later thisweek.   ``They want the company to grow,'' said Genoese, whose unionrepresents about 7,000 Northwest flight attendants and clerks. ``I'mfor anyone that comes in that will make things grow and improvelabor relations,''   Checchi said he also would meet with leaders of the 5,000-memberNorthwest pilots union this week. The pilots are negotiating acontract and have said they will strike if they don't get a dealthat offers competitive wages and job security.</TEXT></DOC>
