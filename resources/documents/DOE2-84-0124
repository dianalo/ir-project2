<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-84-0124 </DOCNO><TEXT>Clay and concrete roof tiles have been collected from three buildingsin southern England and analyzed for /sup 134/Cs and /sup 137/Cs surfaceactivity. Collection took place a little over a year after the passageof a plume from the Chernobyl reactor accident and the execution of asimilar study, in which the dry deposition velocity of particulate Cswas determined. Most tiles were taken from locations adjacent to thoseremoved in the previous study and the weathering of Cs has been evaluated.The /sup 134/Cs on all of the tiles and the /sup 137/Cs on the concretetiles could be ascribed to Chernobyl, however, substantial amounts of/sup 137/Cs on the clay tiles would be due to weapons fall-out also.The results indicate a limited amount of weathering for each Cs isotope,for the concrete tiles, with about 60-80% of the deposited material stillremaining after a year. Retention by the clay tiles appeared to be evengreater than for concrete but there was a wide variability in levels.Overall, for /sup 134/Cs, decay was found to be comparable to weatheringfor reducing activity on roofs, but the longer half-life of /sup 137/Csmeans that weathering was correspondingly more important for this isotope.The low rate of weathering indicates that significant amounts of drydeposited material could remain on a roof for a number of years aftera deposition episode.</TEXT></DOC>
