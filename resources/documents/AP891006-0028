These details were provided by Defense spokesman Pete Williams.All times are Eastern Daylight Time.</TEXT><NOTE>Sunday, Oct. 1</NOTE><TEXT>   Sometime in the evening U.S. military officials receive wordthat a coup is planned for Monday morning. The plotters ask themilitary leaders stationed at U.S. Southern Command if Americantroops ``would be prepared to block access by road'' to theheadquarters of the Panamanian Defense Forces. They also wantedsanctuary for the family of a coup leader.   Williams said U.S. officials agreed to the sanctuary request,but ``did not give an answer'' to the request for roadblocks thatthe rebels said they needed to prevent Noriega from bringing inloyalist relief units.</TEXT><NOTE>Monday, Oct. 2</NOTE><TEXT>   Nothing happens in the morning, but officials again hear fromthe plotters who now say the action will take place Mondayafternoon. ``We receive word of planned coups all the time,''Williams said. Again, no coup transpires.</TEXT><NOTE>Sometime before 5 a.m. EDT, Tuesday, Oct. 3</NOTE><TEXT>   U.S. military officials inform Panamanian Defense Forceofficials _ as required under the Panama Canal Treaty _ thatAmerican based troops would carry out planned exercises.

They appear at the gate, seeking an audiencewith U.S. military officials. Two Panamanians are brought fromtheir vehicle to see Army Gen. Marc Cisneros.   The officers told Cisneros that ``Gen. Noriega and his staffwere under control'' at PDF headquarters, Williams said. Theofficers said ``they had no intention'' to turn Noriega over to theUnited States, but would like to see Noriega retire.   ``They said, in other words, `This is an internal PDF matter,you stay out of it,''' Williams said. ``They said they wanted theUnited States to control U.S. areas; they would control theirareas.''</TEXT><NOTE>Sometime later Tuesday</NOTE><TEXT>   Noriega's loyalist units arrive. Williams said he neither knewhow long the conversation between the Panamanians and the U.S.military officials lasted, nor when the loyalists arrived.
