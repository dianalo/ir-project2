Augusto Pinochet seized power in 1973, AmnestyInternational charged today.   In an 18-page report, the London-based organization said: ``Manyaspects of secret police and military operations have come to lightin the past decade and provide overwhelming evidence that the`disappeared' were victims of the military government's program toeliminate suspected opponents.''   Amnesty appealed to Chilean authorities to account for theprisoners.   The report said the prisoners' plight had been sufficientlydocumented by non-governmental investigations to be presented toChilean courts, but that in virtually all cases the investigationshave been blocked by higher courts or obstructed by the securityforces.   In some cases, the courts have determined the fate of prisonersand found that military and police personnel were involved in thedetention, torture and murder of the victims, it said.   But the report said Chilean authorities often have issued falseor misleading reports on the missing persons, suggesting that thenames were assumed or invented.   Amnesty International said its report compiles for the firsttime a summary of the evidence on the arrests and the secretdetention centers where prisoners were held by what it calledChile's ``secret military and police apparatus.''   The evidence has been gathered by relatives, human rights groupsand members of the judiciary, the report said, and includes thetestimony of hundreds of former prisoners who saw the missing menand women in detention centers and have identified those whooperated the centers.   Other evidence came from confessions by former security forceofficers describing how the ``disappearances'' took place.   The disappearances of Chilean citizens dropped sharply in 1977but have not stopped completely, the report said, adding that fiveopposition activists disappeared as recently as September.   Some court cases involving evidence of serious crimes, includingthose relating to disappearances, have been closed under a 1978amnesty law preventing prosecution for certain crimes committed inthe five years after Pinochet came to power in a military coup, thereport said.   In June 1987, the Appeals Court in Santiago upheld a lower courtdecision that the amnesty law applied to the case of 10 members ofthe outlawed Communist Party whose 1976 disappearance was beinginvestigated by Judge Carlos Cerda.   Cerda caused a sensation in 1986 by charging 38 members of themilitary, including high-ranking officers in active service, in theillegal arrest of two political prisoners who subsequentlydisappeared.   Amnesty International has said the ruling could effectivelyblock future judicial investigations into missing prisoners.</TEXT></DOC>
