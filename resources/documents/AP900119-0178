WELCH</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Mayor Marion Barry's arrest on a cocainecharge threw the capital city's political scene into turmoil Fridayand raised new speculation concerning Jesse Jackson.   Jackson, in Chicago, said he was ``stunned'' by Barry's arrestThursday night, but brushed aside as ``inappropriate at this time''questions about whether he would enter the Washington mayoral race.   The two-time presidential candidate established residence in thenation's capital last year amid wide speculation he would enter the1990 mayoral race, though he said he would not be a candidate ifBarry _ a friend from the civil rights movement _ decided to seekan unprecedented fourth term.   Barry's arrest, which followed years of rumor and investigationsof his activities, drew reactions ranging from sadness to jokingfrom political figures.   ``It raises the Gary Hart question: How can one person be sostupid?'' said Democratic pollster Mark Mellman, referring to theformer presidential candidate whose hopes died when his secretrelationship with a woman other than his wife was revealed.   Jackson said he had spoken by phone with Barry's wife, Effi. ``Iam concerned with her capacity to maintain her strength throughthat crisis,'' he said.   Later, Jackson was asked in an interview from Ann Arbor, Michwith Detroit television station WDIV what the arrest of Barry saidto young black men in the city.   ``Crisis is any public official's life sends shock waves to allchildren. I don't think you should just reduce it to a black-whitesituation,'' Jackson replied.   ``Somehow people who care must reach out with some sense ofmercy and some plan for helping the mayor, while at the same timeproviding adequate and fast services for all the people of thecity,'' he said.   Jackson has held a wide lead in opinion polls over all otherpotential and announced mayoral candidates, but in recent weeksfriends have said he was moving away from a potential mayoral bid.   Four other Democrats have entered the race, and Barry hadscheduled an announcement of his re-election campaign for Sunday.   He postponed that re-election announcement following his arrest.   Barry, 53, was arraigned in federal court Friday on amisdemeanor charge of possession of crack cocaine. He was releasedon his own recognizance.   ``I'm going to leave here and go about the business ofgovernment,'' he said leaving the courtroom. But later, he turnedover day-to-day charge of the city government to city administratorCarol Thompson, retaining only the powers of signing contracts andsigning or vetoing legislation that he cannot delegate.   U.S. attorney Jay Stephens said Barry's arrest at a downtownhotel was ``part of the ongoing investigation of a broad range ofallegations'' against Barry. Federal authorities said they had avideotape of Barry smoking crack cocaine at a downtown hotel.   Barry has repeatedly denied allegations he has used drugs,including the allegations by a former friend who has been convictedon drug charges and was cooperating with authorities.   Those denials were cited by members of both parties afterBarry's arrest.   ``He has been representing to the young people of the districtthat, drugs are bad, don't use them ... and now apparently all ofthat has been hypocrisy,'' said Rep. Stan Parris, R-Va., a frequentBarry critic and who is the ranking Republican on the HouseCommittee on the District of Columbia.   Del. Walter Fauntroy, Washington's elected non-voting member ofCongress, said he was in shock.   ``I've asked the mayor what you have all asked him,'' Fauntroytold reporters, referring to past allegations of drug use. ``Theman has been consistent. He's said no.''   Rep. Lawrence Coughlin, R-Pa., ranking Republican on the HouseSelect Committee on Narcotics, said: ``With almost an incrediblearrogance, Mayor Barry has looked the public in the eye and deniedever having had drug usage and said he was telling the truth. Theexample he has set ... is a horrendous one.''   Democratic National Chairman Ron Brown said: ``I am saddened bythis troubling news. Mayor Barry is entitled to his day in courtand I believe that a discussion of the political options for theDistrict of Columbia should not interfere with the legal process,which must go forward.''   Sen. Brock Adams, R-Wash., chairman of the Senate AppropriationsCommittee's panel on the District of Columbia, said he had beenassured by Deputy Mayor Carol Thompson that there would be no``interruption in the processes of government.''   Barry's arrest came after his comments in a Los Angeles Timesinterview had created a new round of controversy. In a lengthystory published Jan. 7, Barry was quoted as telling a reporter``Isn't anybody in this town can beat me. I'm invincible.'' He alsowas quoted as saying, ``Hah, Jesse don't wanna be no mayor. Jessedon't wanna run nothing but his mouth.''   In that story, the writer described a scene with Barry in alate-night bar, in which the mayor was quoted as saying:``Co-caaaane? How folks use that stuff, anyhow? You put it up yournooose? No! Oooooooeeeeeee!''</TEXT></DOC>
