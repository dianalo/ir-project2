I think of myself as a middle-class guy andevery presidential candidate is out saluting &quot;the middleclass.&quot; So why do I suspect we're all being conned?   Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton, the Democratic front-runner,mentioned the &quot;middle class&quot; a dozen times in his inauguralcampaign speech. He can't give a TV soundbite that doesn'tinclude the phrase, &quot;the forgotten middle class,&quot; echoingRichard Nixon's &quot;silent majority.&quot; Reacting as usual tosomeone else's agenda, President Bush will soon weigh in withhis own tax-subsidy proposals that look a lot likemiddle-class bribes.</LP><TEXT>   If all of this sounds too good to be true, that's becauseit is. Upon inspection, the &quot;middle-class&quot; theme turns out tobe another product of the modern political art of polling.More significant, the goodies the politicians are promisingfor the middle class will inevitably be paid for by the same,well, middle class. This is because, as Willie Sutton saidabout banks, &quot;that's where the money is.&quot;   Consider the Clinton campaign, if only because it's themost fanatical about a middlemarch. The governor didn't wakeup in Little Rock one night with this passion for middleAmerica; he found it in a poll. Specifically, he found it inpolls and &quot;focus groups&quot; conducted by his current adviser andDemocratic pied-piper, Stanley Greenberg.   For years now the ingenious Mr. Greenberg has beenflogging his middle-class theme as the Democrats' path out ofthe presidential wilderness. In September 1988 he wrote aninfluential analysis for the Dukakis campaign, &quot;SpeakingMiddle Class.&quot; It reported on five focus groups with votersin Fresno and other California garden spots. His advicedidn't work in 1988 (Mr. Dukakis took it late), but it'ssince become conventional wisdom among party strategists.   &quot;The primary challenge for Democrats,&quot; Mr. Greenberg wrotein last fall's issue of The American Prospect magazine (thenew intellectual bulletin-board of American liberalism), &quot;isthe rediscovery of the forgotten middle class.&quot; (Mr. Clintonapparently knows a good phrase when he reads one; just don'ttell Joe Biden.)   &quot;The derailing of the conservative alliance in 1990 couldturn into a real crackup,&quot; Mr. Greenberg wrote, referring tothe 1990 Bush-Congress budget deal, &quot;if middle-class andpopulist voters were to focus on the unreality of their`shared interests' with the winners in the 1980s.&quot; This meansassociating Republicans with &quot;the rich,&quot; playing downDemocratic support for the &quot;have-nots,&quot; but smothering the&quot;middle class&quot; with gifts like a passionate suiter.   This may be a plausible strategy in theory, but it beginsto look like a confidence game in practice. The centerpieceof Mr. Clinton's 15-page economic agenda is -- what else? --&quot;tax relief for the forgotten middle class.&quot;   That would be appealing by itself, but then Mr. Clintonadds the kicker: &quot;We should cut middle-class taxesimmediately by 10%, and pay for it with higher income taxeson those earning more than $200,000.&quot; He also proposes a bignew $800 tax credit per child, not to mention &quot;health carefor every American,&quot; a &quot;domestic GI bill&quot; for collegetuition, and other nice things.   What working stiff could object to this, right? Well, holdthe class warfare. It turns out that Mr. Clinton's idea isbased on work by Robert Shapiro, a sharp Democratic economistfor the Progressive Policy Institute. The fine print in hiswork tells a different story.   Mr. Shapiro's proposed new top tax rate of 38.5% (from 31%now) would actually start biting at taxable income of $90,000for singles and $120,000 for heads of households. That'sstarting to get close to a lot of people who feel&quot;middle-class,&quot; as New Jersey Gov. Jim Florio found out whenhe tried to raise their taxes.   Moreover, even that huge hike in tax rates would raiseonly about $23 billion or so in new tax revenue -- a bucketin the ocean of a $1.5 trillion federal budget. And even thispiddling amount assumes, against all human experience, thatno one paying the higher rate will change behavior to shelterincome.   The point is that to pay for his middle-class giveawaysMr. Clinton would sooner or later have to cut spending morethan he's proposed, or else raise taxes on more than the fewsaps who make more than $90,000. And guess who that means?   According to IRS numbers decoded by the Tax Foundation, in1989 a taxpayer was among the top 5% of all taxpayers -- therichest Americans -- with an adjusted gross income of only$77,600. The top 25% threshold was crossed at taxable incomeof a mere $37,064. That probably includes every workingAmerican couple, who certainly wouldn't consider themselves&quot;rich.&quot; Concludes Paul Merski of the Tax Foundation: &quot;Toraise any real money, you have to go to the middle class.&quot;   Mr. Clinton is assuming that &quot;middleclass&quot; voters somehowwon't figure all this out. But don't be so sure. KarlynKeene, who follows public opinion for the American EnterpriseInstitute, says most Americans say they'd like a&quot;middle-class&quot; tax cut, but few expect ever to get it. Bythis November middle-class voters may have heard enoughpromises that they'd just as soon be &quot;forgotten&quot; once again.</TEXT></DOC>
