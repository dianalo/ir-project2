The Hamburg-based Bild newspaper said Samir Khadar ``directed theLockerbie attack on Dec. 21'' from West Germany. It said Khadartraveled to West Germany in December ``to prepare for Lockerbie,''and that he was in Bonn, the West German capital.   A federal official denied Khadar was being sought in connectionwith Flight 103 but said authorities are looking for him inconnection with other terrorist attacks.   Greek authorities said last year they believed Khadar was killedin a car bombing hours before a Palestinian terrorist attack on acruise ship off Greece in which nine people died July 11. Greekauthorities said he planned the attack.   But Swedish police arrested five people last month they said weremembers of a terrorist cell headed by Khadar, and they said therewere contradictory reports on his death.   The Swedish police identified Khadar as a Palestinian member ofthe Abu Nidal group, a radical Palestinian faction, and said theyseized weapons and plastic explosives in a search of his Stockholmhome in August.   U.S. officials also believe Khadar is still alive, and Italy andSweden reportedly have issued warrants for his arrest.   The bombing of Flight 103 took place over Lockerbie, Scotland,and killed all 259 people aboard and 11 on the ground. Investigatorsin England have determined that a bomb hidden in a cassette-recorderdowned the jet. The New York-bound flight originated in West Germanyand changed planes at Heathrow Airport in London.   Bild said Khadar is known as the ``professor'' of terrorists andalso uses various aliases. Bild's report carried a front-pagephotograph of a dark-haired man with a moustache, whom it identifedas Khadar.   In London, the Sunday Express newspaper reported Sunday that aLibyan known as ``the professor'' slipped into West Germany usingthe alias ``Patel'' and had worked out of the Iranian Embassy inBonn.   The paper said a passenger who died on Flight 103 had visited theLibyan's hotel room in Bonn and may have unwittingly carried thebomb-laden cassette-recorder that downed the plane.   West German officials and British police denied that report.   Alexander Prechtel, spokesman for the chief federal prosecutor'soffice in Karlsruhe, told The Associated Press the Bild report was``just more speculation,'' on who was responsible for the Pan Ambombing.   But Prechtel said Khadar is being sought as a suspect ``forattacks in Italy and France, and his name is known to authoritieshere.'' He did not give details on the attack in France.   ``But we don't have any evidence that he was in West Germany, andthere is no evidence of a link to the Lockerbie attack,'' Prechtelsaid.   ``If he had been here he would have been arrested and extraditedto Italy or France. We have very close cooperation on suchmatters,'' Prechtel added.   According to Bild, Khadar was involved with terrorist attacks inRome in 1983 on the U.S. Embassy and on a Jewish synagogue in whichit said a total of 37 people died. Bild also said he is suspected inconnection with the December 1985 bombing at Rome's airport in which12 people died.</TEXT></DOC>
