Advances in prices for future delivery of soybeans, corn, oats,hogs, pork bellies and platinum spurred the Commodity ResearchBureau's index of 21 commodities to a 5.50-point gain. The indexsettled at 248.39, its highest mark since February 1985, saidStuart Shinbein, senior technical analyst for the private, NewYork-based advisory service for commodities traders.   Futures on wheat, hogs, cattle, oil, gold, silver, stocks andbonds also moved higher.   A concurrent rise in stock-index and U.S. Treasury bond futuresis unusual. Such occurrences historically mark turning points inthe financial markets, Shinbein said.   ``My feeling is that stocks are coming out of an oversoldcondition and commodities are moving into an overboughtcondition,'' he said. Such a scenario would call eventually for asharp drop in commodities prices.   Analysts could cite no single reason behind Tuesday's sharpgains but the the buying surges appeared to hit the markets indomino fashion, beginning with grains and soybeans.   Soybean futures opened and closed up the 30-cents-a-bushel limitallowed for daily trading on the Chicago Board of Trade in responseto the Midwest's hot, dry weekend and predictions for more of thesame.   ``Weather's the story, that's the whole ball game,'' said VictorLespinasse, a trader with the investment firm Dean Witter ReynoldsInc. in New York.   The Agriculture Department reported soybean planting was about74 percent finished as of Sunday. Traders fear a drier-than-normalsummer could lead to tight supplies next year, analysts said.   Wheat, corn and oat crops also would suffer during a summer oflittle rain, but the rapid depletion of soybean stockpiles has madethat market particularly sensitive to growing conditions.   Tuesday's gains brought the near-month soybean contract, fordelivery in July, to within easy striking range of $8 a bushel forthe first time since the spring of 1984.   Eight of the nine soybean contracts finished limit up, as didthe contracts for September and December delivery of oats and Marchdelivery of corn, both of which carry a 10-cents-a-bushel limit.   Wheat settled 9{ cents to 15{ cents higher with the contract fordelivery in July at $3.51{ a bushel; corn was 7} cents to 10 centshigher with July at $2.24\ a bushel; oats were 9} cents to 10 centshigher with July at $1.82{ a bushel; soybeans were 18{ cents to 30cents higher with July at $7.98 a bushel.   The soaring grain markets supported livestock and meat futureson the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, said Philip Stanley, an analystin Chicago with Thomson McKinnon Securities Inc.   Unseasonably warm weather lent additional support to the porkbellies, which are sliced to make bacon and often end up insummertime bacon-lettuce-and-tomato sandwiches, Stanley said.   ``The BLT season is probably what's got everybody pumped upabout the bellies,'' he said.   Live cattle settled .23 cent to .72 cent higher with thecontract for delivery in June at 72.15 cents a pound; feeder cattlewere .08 cent to .43 cent higher with August at 76.35 cents apound; hogs settled .40 cent to the limit 1.50 cents higher withJune at 54.77 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were up the2-cents-a-pound limit across the board with July at 56.32 cents apound.   The higher agricultural commodity prices _ often perceived as aninflationary signal _ prompted hedge-type buying of gold and silverfutures on New York's Commodity Exchange and heavy buying ofplatinum on the New York Mercantile Exchange, analysts said.   The dollar's relative weakness against foreign currencies hasmade platinum particularly attractive to Japanese and Europeaninvestors, said Richard Maseri, senior trader for JCC Inc., aMiami-based commodities brokerage.   Platinum settled $25 to $33.70 higher with July at $610.90 atroy ounce. Gold was $3.50 to $4.20 higher with June at $455 a troyounce; silver was 7 cents to 10 cents higher with June at $6.60 atroy ounce.   Stock-index futures jumped sharply on the Chicago MercantileExchange, where the contract for June delivery of the Standard andamp;Poor's 500 index settled 9.45 points higher at 262.95.   Oil prices rose in light trading on the New York MercantileExchange but dealers were reluctant to take new positions inadvance of OPEC's June 8 meeting in Vienna, analysts said.   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 5 cents lower to 8cents higher with July at $17.51 a barrel; heating oil was .06 centto .45 cent higher with June at 48.23 cents a gallon; unleadedgasoline was .04 cent to .40 cent higher with June at 52.95 cents agallon.</TEXT></DOC>
