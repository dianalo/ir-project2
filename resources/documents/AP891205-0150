The Navy, which acknowledged Monday that it had ``shouldered''the protest ship away from the test site, said Tuesday that it hadnot rammed the vessel.   ``We have a message for the Navy,'' Greenpeace USA ExecutiveDirector Peter Bahouth told a news conference. ``We are going totake legal action. They are going to have to pay us damages.''   He declined to give details or say how much the group might seekin damages for the alleged incident Monday in the Atlantic Ocean 50miles off the Florida coast just before the submarine Tennesseefired the $26.5 million missile.   The Navy denied that it rammed the 887-ton ship Greenpeace. Theservice said that it respected the group's right to protest butthat it also had a right under international law to protect itselfon the high seas.   At the news conference, Greenpeace leaders showed videotapes oftwo vessels identified as the Navy tugs Grasp and Kittiwakespraying the decks of the Greenpeace and pulling alongside. Thetapes showed gaping holes in the hull of the Greenpeace; groupleaders said the gashes resulted from rammings by the tugs.   The videotapes also showed Greenpeace activists in an inflatablespeedboat approach what appeared to be an antenna from a submergedsubmarine. The group's leaders said the object was the radio mastof the Tennessee.   The group said Navy commandos cut the fuel lines of twoinflatable speedboats and returned them to the mother ship. Nocommandos appeared on the videotape.   At the Pentagon, spokesman Pete Williams said the ``Navy didn'tram the Greenpeace boat.''   He said that the United States, under international law,``reserves and will exercise its right to protect its vessels andcrews engaged in lawful high-seas activities and protect them frominterference or other action by others that would endanger U.S.vessels and their crews.''   On Monday, the Navy said that, after repeated warnings, the tugshad ``shouldered'' the Greenpeace ``out of the safety arc'' of thetest firing. Vice Adm. Roger Bacon, commander of the AtlanticSubmarine Fleet, said in Cape Canaveral, Fla., that the tugs hadused fire hoses against the Greenpeace and that the fuel line ofone inflatable speedboat had been cut after the other speedboatbroke down.   The Navy said Monday that the Greenpeace had sustained a hole 1foot in diameter.   The protest was part of a ``nuclear-free seas'' campaign theorganization launched in 1987, according to Bahouth. The shipGreenpeace replaced the Rainbow Warrior as the group's flagshipafter the latter vessel was mined by French security agents whileit was protesting French nuclear tests in the Pacific Ocean.   ``We do expect to mix it up with the Navy,'' said Greenpeaceleader William M. Arkin. ``That's the point of protesting. That iswhy we were there. But we had never expected this kind of force,this kind of maliciousness.''   He said the two Navy vessels not only tore holes in the hull ofthe Greenpeace but rammed it while a helicopter chartered by thegroup was attempting to land on its decks. He said the Navy'saction in pouring water down its stacks could have caused anexplosion.</TEXT></DOC>
