The productwas obtained by single-cycle heating to 920 {sup 0}C. Unlike conventionalpreparations, the orthorhombic phase is obtained without the requirementof an extended annealing period. Magnetic susceptibility measurementsshow the onset of superconductivity occurs at 95 K with a magnetic-fluxexpulsion of 5% at lower temperatures. X-ray powder diffraction datashow the material to be predominantly the orthorhombic phase, with excessBaO impurity and none of the tetragonal phase present.</TEXT></DOC>
