The lawsuits, filed Tuesday in U.S. District Court here, accusedozens of insurance companies of collaborating in a global boycottof certain types of general liability insurance through secretagreements and internal pressure.   The suits, filed by California, New York, West Virginia,Wisconsin, Minnesota, Massachusetts and Alabama, named 32 insurancecompanies, underwriters and associations, including Lloyd's ofLondon.   Arizona planned to sue in the same court today, and Texas fileda separate suit in its state court because the state ``has one ofthe toughest, best antitrust laws in the nation,'' said TexasAttorney General Jim Mattox.   ``These defendants have sucked the blood of our nation'seconomic well-being,'' Mattox said at a news conference in Austin.   New York State Attorney General Robert Abrams said the case wasone of the largest ever tackled by a group of states in a federalcourt, adding that the states had to take action because thefederal government did nothing.   One of the companies, Aetna Life and Casualty Co., condemned thesuit as ``another political move by political officeholders whohave consistently opposed any and all efforts to address the realproblems of the nation's liability system.''   A spokesman for the Insurance Services Office, a 1,400-memberindustry trade group also named in the suit, called the allegationsunfounded.   The lawsuits claim the companies targeted for eliminationcoverage for pollution accidents and general liability for damagediscovered after the life of a policy, known as ``occurrence''coverage.   The companies instead favored more limited policies, coveringonly losses that were suffered and claimed within the policy term,excluding damage that was discovered later, the suits said.   The lawsuits said four major insurance companies _ Hartford FireInsurance Co., Allstate Insurance Co., Cigna Corp. and Aetna _started a campaign in 1984 to curtail coverage that was generallyavailable in the industry.   According to the suits, the companies got major U.S. and Britishreinsurers, including underwriters at Lloyd's of London, tothreaten a boycott of any U.S. insurance company that provided thebroader coverage.   At the same time, the suits said, major insurers and reinsurerspressured the Insurance Services Office to stop distributingstandard forms, so that it would be impractical for individualcompanies to continue offering that coverage.   As a result, the suits said, property damage insurance for localgovernments, nonprofit agencies such as child care centers, andvarious businesses suddenly became unavailable or prohibitivelyexpensive.   ``This illegal boycott was a major contributor to the insurancecrisis that forced so many cities and businesses up against thewall,'' California Attorney General John Van de Kamp said.   ``It was the public and the consumer who paid the price for thiscollusive exercise in corporate greed.''   In California and elsewhere, local governments cut back oreliminated services, such as parks and police, because of insuranceexpenses, Van de Kamp said. Many local officials blamed risingdamage awards in injury suits and joined the insurance industry inefforts to restrict the right to sue.   Van de Kamp said the attorneys general decided to file togetherhere because he has taken the lead on the issue and California lawis favorable to the case and might be cited by the federal court.   Among other things, the plaintiffs seek to restructure theInsurance Services Office by giving non-insurers a majority on itsboard and making public its data on insurance coverage losses.   Dave Ostwald, the spokesman for the Insurance Services Office inNew York City, said rates increased mainly because of ``ademonstrable increase in claims losses and a drop in interestrates, slowing down (insurers') investment income.''   He said pollution coverage was changed in response to expansivecourt decisions. Pollution insurance and ``occurrence'' coverageremained available, with some restrictions, he added.   The Hartford Insurance Group called the lawsuit ``totallywithout substance'' and said it is confident that all chargeseventually will be dismissed. It said the rates in question areestablished from judgments that are legal and involve no otherinsurer or insurance organization.</TEXT></DOC>
