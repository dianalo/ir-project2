Spence served up some cautionary words at the foreign exchange desk of Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co. last week.    &quot;I told them they could go out and have a good time on their own time, but this is a time of year when we should pay particular attention to the markets,&quot; says Mr. Spence, the chief dealer.    His advice is well-founded. Although foreign exchange activity usually slows down between the Thanksgiving and New Year's holidays, the sharp drop-off in trading volume creates a potentially volatile atmosphere for exchange rates in which wide swings can be catastrophic for dealers caught unaware, and rewarding for others.    From Thanksgiving week through the first Monday after New Year's Day, the dollar's value swung more than 5% between its high and low points in each of the past three years. In 1984 the swing was 6.6% in the six-week period.    &quot;These are good markets for those who pay attention to them, and can be very lucrative,&quot; says Mr. Spence.    But most dealers don't pay attention, which makes the market so thin and choppy in the first place. Foreign exchange managers say December is a heavy vacation month, and staffing generally dwindles to half-strength in the week between Christmas and New Year's Day. Vacations similarly affect corporate and investor clients, who normally are big contributors to volume.    &quot;Between Christmas and New Year's, you might cut back to what you think is the bare minimum,&quot; says Thomas Barman, senior vice president of foreign exchange at Credit Suisse's New York branch.    This is also time for dealers to count their winnings or lick their wounds while minimizing market exposure until the new year heralds a new accounting and bonus period. &quot;People who made money want to keep it, and those who lost money don't want to lose more,&quot; John J. McCarthy, vice president of foreign exchange at Irving Trust Co., says.    Mr. Barman adds that &quot;there's a general sense in the market that by the time Thanksgiving rolls around, if you haven't met budget you're not going to.&quot; So instead of trading, he says, December is a month when many dealers are &quot;away from the desk to catch up on paper work, or to take long lunches, or to take lunches for the first time.&quot;    The holiday slack period is more pronounced in Europe, traders say. &quot;They don't have the Protestant work ethic driving them,&quot; comments one.    Even in the Tokyo market, where this isn't holiday season, volume is expected to drop along with the activity of Japan's dealing partners abroad. &quot;The Tokyo market is in harmony with the overseas markets, so it will be very quiet,&quot; says Masakazu Miyamori, who came from Tokyo three years ago to become senior vice president and chief trader at Sanwa Bank Ltd., New York.    The expected sparse trading makes exchange-rate forecasting for the remainder of 1987 even more of a crapshoot than usual. But many traders believe the dollar will continue moving down, following a 33-month trend. Among the negative factors for the dollar, they cite the continuing large U.S. trade deficit and the poor reception for the bipartisan plan to cut the federal budget deficit. Some dealers see the dollar slipping under 1.6 marks and 130 Japanese yen by Jan. 1.    It's easier, however, to predict that there will be volatility as trading dies out with the old year, and a news headline or large corporate order can send exchange rates darting. The market may move significantly as companies do last-minute year-end repatriation of overseas profits or hedging of foreign-exchange exposures, says Mr. Spence at Manufacturers Hanover. &quot;This is my favorite month of the year because there are so many unique opportunities to make money,&quot; he says.    And even in the holiday season, market momentum can snowball. &quot;Traders don't want to do anything,&quot; says Irving's Mr. McCarthy, &quot;but if they see the dollar coming lower, they'll sell, and the move will be accentuated.&quot;    The dollar ended near its intraday lows in quiet post-holiday trading as the market remained pessimistic about the ability of the U.S. administration and Congress to implement the recently signed budget deficit reduction agreement.    The dollar was quoted at 132.78 yen, a record low, in early Tokyo trading Monday. Traders said Japan's central bank had intervened in an attempt to support the dollar.    In New York Friday, the U.S. unit's decline after Thursday's holiday followed overnight losses in Tokyo. The dollar closed there Friday at 133.75 yen, down from 134.43 yen at opening. Traders in New York said the U.S. currency rose to intraday highs in early trading, but soon began to move down steadily.    The dollar finished at 1.6540 West German marks, down from 1.6675 marks in London late Thursday. Against the Japanese unit, the dollar ended at 133.55 yen, below 134.55 yen recorded late Thursday in London.    Dealers said a short midmorning turnaround in New York was cut short by a rumor in the foreign exchange market of an impending realignment of currencies in the European Monetary System. There wasn't any substantiation of the rumor.    The rumor sparked &quot;dumping of dollar positions and a spate of buying of marks,&quot; said one dealer. He said those who took heed of the rumor bought the German unit on expectations that any EMS realignment would include an upward valuation of the German unit.    Dealers said the pound's break above the $1.80 level in Europe Friday also opened the floodgates for the rise of other major currencies against the dollar.    Gold was quoted at $488.38 an ounce in early trading Monday in Hong Kong.
