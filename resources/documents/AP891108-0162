Voters again turned out in large numbers Wednesday, the second offive days of voting for an assembly that will write a constitutionand make Namibia independent of South Africa after 74 years.   Upendura, 22, and many others camped overnight at their places inline or went home to sleep after failing to reach the voting boothsTuesday, when some lines extended more than a mile. The lines wereslightly shorter Wednesday, but again the heat was sweltering.   Helicopters are being used as mobile voting stations in someremote areas, visiting a different village each day.   On Tuesday, 210,053 people cast ballots _ 30 percent of the vast,mineral-rich territory's 701,483 registered voters.   ``Given the circumstances in this country, this is a mammothachievement,'' said David Venter, a spokesman for the Namibianadministration appointed by South Africa, which captured theterritory from Germany in World War I.   South Africa had resisted U.N. efforts to get it out of Namibiasince 1966, but finally agreed to grant independence under the worldorganization's supervision. No independence date has been set, butNamibia is expected to be free by early next year.   Despite heat in the 90s and slow-moving lines, voters turned outin numbers almost equal to those of Tuesday, said U.N. spokesmanFred Eckhard.   He said there were scattered incidents of intimidation anddistribution of bogus pamphlets aimed at discrediting the favoredparty, the South-West Africa People's Organization, which fought a23-year bush war against South African occupation.   A territorial official said three children were killed when agrenade they found exploded. The territorial radio said a baby waskilled and several people injured in pushing and shoving Tuesday attwo northern polling stations.   Eckhard said the U.N. could not confirm the death of the baby butthat a child was among three people injured in one incident.   State Department deputy spokesman Richard Boucher said inWashington that the Bush administration was very encouraged byinitial reports that turnout was heavy and voting was proceedingsmoothly. He called on all parties to abide by election rules.   The election focuses on whether SWAPO, which leans to the left,will win two-thirds of the seats so it can write a constitutionwithout consulting other parties.   Its chief rival is the Democratic Turnhalle Alliance, amultiracial coalition that favors a capitalist economy and was partof the transitional government installed by South Africa.   Seats will be allocated according to the proportion of votesreceived by each of the 10 parties involved.   Dirk Mudge, a white farmer who leads the Democratic TurnhalleAlliance, said the South African government and news media decidedin advance that a SWAPO victory was certain.   ``We are already fighting an uphill battle without it being mademore difficult by South African assumptions,'' he said.   Officials said the election could be extended through a sixthday, Sunday, but Gerhard Roux, spokesman for the transitionalgovernment, predicted that would not be necessary.   Election officials hope to know the outcome by Nov. 15. Theassembly is to convene one week after the results are final.</TEXT></DOC>
