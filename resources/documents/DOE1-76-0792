<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-76-0792 </DOCNO><TEXT>A rotary combustor for burning municipal solid waste is described comprising,in combination, pipes secured together to define an inner generally cylindricalsurface, means mounting the pipes for rotation about the axis of thecylindrical surface with the axis being tilted so as to have a high anda low end. The pipes at the low end are formed so that the generallycylindrical surface becomes frustoconical towards the low end and thelower portion of the frustoconical surface tilts in the direction ofthe axis but at a lesser angle so that a larger diameter end of the frustoconicalsurface is contiguous with the cylindrical surface and a smaller diameterend of the frustoconical surface is lower than a lower edge of the largediameter end of the frustoconical surface. Means for rotating the pipesabout the axis, means for circulating water through the pipes, and meansfor feeding municipal solid waste in the high end of the surface areprovided. The pipes are secured so as to define intermediate openingsso that the cylindrical and frustoconical surfaces are gas porous toprovide a rotary combustor adapted for burning municipal solid waste.</TEXT></DOC>
