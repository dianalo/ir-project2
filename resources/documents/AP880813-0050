Shopowners and residents near college campuses stageddemonstrations urging students to halt unrest which they said hurtsbusiness and would mar next month's Olympic Games in the capital.   A senior government official said the government was considering``a grave decision'' this fall to protect the nation from leftistforces. Newspapers and political analyists interpreted the remarksas suggesting a crackdown on dissent after the Games.   About 1,000 students sneaked onto Yonsei University campusdespite human barricades set up by thousands of riot police aroundthe campus in an effort to block student gatherings. Studentshurled hundreds of firebombs in a series of attacks around thecampus but failed to break the police blockade.   Dozens of policemen in heavy riot gear were seen falling downafter being hit by rocks, sticks or iron pipes in continued battlesalong the fence. Police responded with barrages of tear gas.   Police also drove back about 200 students who hurled firebombsand rocks in an effort to march from the Myongdong Roman Catholiccathedral in downtown Seoul.   At least 20 students were injured, and about 200 were taken intopolice custody.   About 500 shopowners and residents around Yonsei demonstratedbetween students and riot police at the gate. They urged studentsnot to cause unrest that hurts business and the Olympic mood.   Similar counter-protests were reported near the MyongdongCathedral by some 100 people carrying placards, in front of theKorea University in eastern Seoul and two other cities, accordingto Korean news agency Yonhap.   The radicals claim that more than 7,000 students across thecountry have volunteered to join a rally at Yonsei that is tocontinue until Monday, when students plan to march to the borderfor reunification talks with their North Korean counterparts.   North and South Korean student representatives have called for ameeting in the border truce village of Panmunjom on Monday to markthe Aug. 15 anniversary of the liberation of the Korean Peninsulafrom Japan's colonial rule in 1945.   Korea was divided into the Communist North and the capitalistSouth at the end of World War II, and the division deepened after abloody war in 1950-53. Radical South Korean students, a small butvocal minority, are demanding reunification.   Police bent on foiling disturbances before the Sept. 17-Oct. 2Olympics in Seoul have enforced stringent security measures toblock student marches and rallies advocating talks with NorthKorean students.   Police said they have been ordered to refrain from using teargas as part of a government effort to maintain a festive Olympicmood. But the strategy has led to more injuries. Police said atleast 120 students and policemen have been injured since Wednesday.   Kim Yong-kap, the minister for government administration,accused the students of seeking to disrupt the Olympics andoverthrow the government and said, ``The government cannot but makea grave decision after the Olympics if the current politicalsituation continues.''   A former military officer, Kim served as a senior intelligenceofficial at the Agency for National Security Planning, formerlycalled the KCIA, under the authoritarian government of formerPresident Chun Doo-hwan.   Kim said the nation was at a crossroads where it would be``communized like Vietnam'' or prosper with democracy. He saidthere has been an expansion of leftist forces aligning themselveswith North Korean propaganda.   ``At this point, the protection of our democratic system is moreimportant than the successful hosting of the Olympics,'' Kim added.</TEXT></DOC>
