<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-15-0561 </DOCNO><TEXT>The demonstration project at Vester Nebel is a combined collective heatsupplying system. The plant has the purpose of demonstrating the possibilitiesof using renewable energy sources for collective heat supply in smallercommunities. 97 buildings, mainly single-family houses, are connectedto the plant. The production of heat comes from solar collector, heatpump, straw-fueled boiler, oil-fueled boiler and wind turbines. Heatsupply to the heat pump is mainly produced by solar energy. The operationof the heat producing units is that the solar collectors are not connectedto the other units. The heat pump starts when the solar collector isnot producing enough, then the strawfueled boiler starts, and when allthese cannot sustain the supply, the oil-fueled boiler is used as peakload. The system has as a whole been very reliable, exept that the heatloss in the distribution system has been 25%, which is higher than theexpected 13%. (SM). 10 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
