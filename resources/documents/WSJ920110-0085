A Securities and Exchange Commission study, a copy ofwhich was obtained by this newspaper, concludes that it wouldbe &quot;extremely difficult&quot; to use advance knowledge of Treasurybids to profit from options, futures or other financialproducts.</LP><TEXT>   The report, to Sen. Joseph Lieberman (D., Conn.), rebuts aconspiracy theory that has repeatedly been put forth in thehalls of Congress. Several senior officials of the SalomonInc. unit had oversight authority over both the firm'sTreasury-securities department and other departments, and thefirm has admitted to falsifying bids and cornering the marketfor government bonds and notes. This led congressionalofficials and others to wonder whether the firm was able toprofit in futures and options markets by knowing how itstrading desk and customers planned to bid in the comingTreasury auctions.   As far and away the largest player in the governmentsecurities market, Salomon would have been able to know withmore certainty just what the final auction price would havebeen.   Despite that, the report, written as a memo by WilliamHeyman, director of market regulation, repeatedly contendsthat it is &quot;difficult&quot; to profit in futures, options,currencies, certificates of deposit or other financialproducts simply because an investor might have &quot;advanceknowledge of the results of a particular Treasury auction.&quot;   The SEC report said that &quot;while the auction of aparticular Treasury instrument could have some influence oninterest rates and the overall yield curve, other factors,such as Federal Reserve policy and the state of the economy,probably have a more significant impact.&quot;   The SEC, Justice Department and U.S. Attorney's Office inManhattan are investigating the wrongdoing at Salomon, whichhas changed management and fired the senior officialsallegedly responsible for the illegal activities. But thegovernment inquiry is moving slowly, and it isn't clear whatsanctions the government will try to impose on the firm orits former aides.   The latest report raises doubts about whether the SEC'sinquiry will determine that there were problems in any marketother than the Treasury-securities market and in the relatedmarket for the debt of government-sponsored agencies.Although the report to Sen. Lieberman wasn't written by theenforcement division, which is conducting the SECinvestigation, it bore a cover letter from SEC ChairmanRichard Breeden and would reflect the agency's broader viewof the issue.   On another government-securities market front, the SEC'sMr. Heyman said in a separate report that the decline in thenumber of interdealer brokers shouldn't hurt the liquidity orefficiency of the market. He said recent price drops forbrokers' services &quot;suggest that there is room for pricecompetition in the interdealer brokerage market&quot; and addedthat &quot;it does not appear necessary at this time to regulateaccess or pricing&quot; in this market.   Interdealer brokers, of which there are currently seven,facilitate trading in the government-securities market,disseminating quotes and last-sale prices submitted bycustomers and executing transactions as ordered.   ---   Corrections andamp; Amplifications                                                                                                          SALOMON BROTHERS Inc. has acknowledged buying, along withcustomers, 87% of the two-year Treasury notes in last May'sauction but has denied that it cornered the market for thenotes. Friday's edition incorrectly said the firm admittedcornering the market.   (WSJ Jan. 14, 1992)</TEXT></DOC>
