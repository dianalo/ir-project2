Machine, Man Still Ahead in the Game of Chess</HEAD><DATELINE>CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Chess champion Antoly Karpov proved thatman can still outwit machine when he beat supercomputer DeepThought late Friday in a hard-fought match that went down to thewire.   With only 90 seconds left to Deep Thought's 12 minutes, Karpovforced the computer to resign in the face of inevitable defeat.   Karpov, the world's No. 2-ranked chess player, made a decisivepenetration into Deep Thought's territory with his king after thecomputer, which can calculate 800,000 moves in a second, made astrategic error.   The match, which lasted nearly two hours, was held in Harvard'sMemorial Hall. One member of Deep Thought's crew, Sen-Hsiung Hsu,moved the pieces based on the computer's commands.   Chris Chabris, alumni adviser to the Harvard Chess Club, saidKarpov was ``was very relieved'' to have finished the game with hisworld-class reputation intact.   ``He knew he was in a lot of trouble,'' Chabris said. Karpovleft immediately after the match instead of speaking as scheduled.   ``Everyone was very impressed with the way Deep Thought wasperforming today. We look forward to watching Deep Thought'sprogress in the future,'' said the Harvard Chess Club's president,Danny Edelman.   Just before the match, Karpov was given the key to the city andwarmly welcomed by Edelman, who said Deep Thought was ready forrevenge after being beaten by World Chess Champion Gary Kasparov inOctober of 1989.   However, by sacrificing a pawn, Karpov was able to isolate DeepThought's pawns in a move Edelman termed ``brilliant.'' After thepawns were isolated, it was an easy win for Karpov, Chabris said.</TEXT></DOC>
