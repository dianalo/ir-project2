Stewart and Daniel HertzbergStaff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 12/21/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> STOCK MARKET, OFFERINGS (STK)SECURITIES INDUSTRY (SCR)JUSTICE DEPARTMENT (JUS) </IN><DATELINE> NEW YORK  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Former arbitrager Ivan F. Boesky was sentenced to a three-year prison term in a proceeding that marked the end of at least one chapter in the largest scandal in Wall Street's history.    But the scandal is far from over. Comments at Friday's sentencing strongly suggest Mr. Boesky has implicated far more individuals and firms than have been suspected. Leon Silverman, Mr. Boesky's lawyer and a partner at Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver andamp; Jacobson in New York, said that among the dozens implicated are &quot;at least five major brokerage firms, the names of which I cannot disclose&quot; because of pending investigations.    Federal Judge Morris E. Lasker, in imposing the sentence on Mr. Boesky, indicated that others may be even more culpable. He said Mr. Boesky engaged not only in insider trading but &quot;in many transactions at the behest of others on a scale so substantial as to represent a systemic problem in the financial market.&quot; He said Mr. Boesky's crimes are &quot;of the highest seriousness.&quot;    But Judge Lasker also praised Mr. Boesky's cooperation, agreeing with government prosecutors that the scope of his cooperation has been &quot;unprecedented&quot; and the most significant since the passage of the securities laws in the 1930s.    Mr. Boesky will surrender to federal prison authorities on March 24. He will be eligible for parole after serving one year of his sentence, but Rudolph W. Giuliani, the U.S. attorney in Manhattan, said it is unlikely Mr. Boesky would be paroled before serving two years. Mr. Boesky has asked to be assigned to Lompoc federal prison, a minimum-security facility in California, so that he won't be surrounded by others convicted of securities fraud and insider trading.    Mr. Giuliani noted that Mr. Boesky's sentence is the third most severe ever meted out for insider trading. He praised the sentence, saying that it will deter similar crimes and that it rewards Mr. Boesky for his cooperation.    &quot;In numerous, numerous instances, where he has told us things, it's turned out it was absolutely true,&quot; Mr. Giuliani said of Mr. Boesky's cooperation. &quot;He's obviously been very, very important&quot; as a witness.    Mr. Boesky, once one of the richest and most powerful figures on Wall Street, stunned the financial world in November 1986 with the announcement that he had agreed to plead guilty to one felony and had settled Securities and Exchange Commission charges by paying a record $100 million. Mr. Boesky pleaded guilty in April to a conspiracy to file false statements with the SEC, which carried a maximum prison term of five years and a fine of $250,000. Judge Lasker said he wasn't imposing any fine on Mr. Boesky so that whatever assets he has will be available to plaintiffs in civil suits.    Mr. Silverman said Judge Lasker received a sworn financial statement from Mr. Boesky, who, the lawyer said, has been &quot;virtually wiped out&quot; by the SEC settlement and criminal proceedings. Both Mr. Silverman and Mr. Giuliani denied that Mr. Boesky has any hidden bank accounts, in the U.S. or elsewhere. Mr. Giuliani noted that if Mr. Boesky has misstated his finances, he could be prosecuted for perjury.    Judge Lasker noted that &quot;there is no doubt that Boesky has been humiliated, vilified and cut down to size in a degree rarely heard of in the life of a person who was once regarded favorably as a celebrity.&quot;    It was clear Mr. Boesky remains a celebrity. Police barricades outside Manhattan's federal courthouse held back hundreds of reporters, photographers and television cameramen. The packed courtroom was largely filled with reporters and courtroom artists. Mr. Silverman said Mr. Boesky has been &quot;vilified and excoriated in the press and other media for some 13 months.&quot;    Mr. Boesky looked pale but composed as he stood before Judge Lasker to be sentenced. In a soft voice, he referred to his statement at a pre-sentencing hearing in which he said, &quot;I am deeply ashamed and do not understand my behavior . . . . I would like the opportunity as I go forward to redeem myself and leave this earth with a good name. That is what I want.&quot;    Mr. Boesky approached government investigators after he was implicated in an insider trading ring by former investment banker Dennis B. Levine, who was sentenced to two years for his role in the scandal. Mr. Boesky in turn implicated others, and his cooperation has already led to guilty pleas by Martin A. Siegel, a former investment banker at Kidder, Peabody and Co.; Boyd Jefferies, former chairman of Jefferies Group Inc.; and a former Boesky employee. He also led British authorities to uncover a major financial scandal involving Guinness PLC's takeover of Distillers Co.    As previously reported, people familiar with the government investigation say that Mr. Boesky also has implicated Michael Milken, the head of junk-bond operations at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., triggering a massive investigation of Drexel Burnham, and John Mulheren, a major arbitrager and head of Jamie Securities Co., as well as numerous others whose identities haven't surfaced. Messrs. Milken and Mulheren and Drexel Burnham have denied any wrongdoing and haven't been charged with any offense.    Mr. Silverman, the lawyer, said that secrecy considerations prevented him from disclosing details of what Mr. Boesky has told the government, but he suggested that the value and scope of the information has been enormous. He said Mr. Boesky has provided &quot;invaluable&quot; information to the government about merchant banking and arbitrage, including information about his dealings with &quot;dozens&quot; of Wall Street figures. He said Mr. Boesky has provided details of &quot;hundreds&quot; of merger and takeover transactions, and has disclosed further wrongdoing in which he wasn't a participant.    Despite the praise for Mr. Boesky's cooperation, the prison term meted out was plainly intended as a message to Wall Street. &quot;The signal must go out,&quot; Judge Lasker said. &quot;The time has come when it is totally unacceptable for courts to act as if prison is unthinkable for white-collar defendants.&quot; He said that &quot;to preserve not only the actual integrity of the financial markets but the appearance of integrity in those markets, criminal behavior such as Mr. Boesky's cannot go unchecked.&quot;    John Carroll, the government prosecutor, said &quot;power and position create no immunity to punishment&quot; and &quot;the cost of being caught cannot be measured even in the millions of dollars.&quot;    ---               How the Boesky Sentence Compares                   PRISON INSIDER TRADER    TERM        REMARKS Paul Thayer       4 years     Former deputy defense                               secretary; LTV chairman;                               convicted after trial;                               obstructed justice.
