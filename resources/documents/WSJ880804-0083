Donnelley andamp; Sons Co., the epicenter of a burgeoning insider-trading scandal, executives are reviewing security measures aimed at preventing further leaks of sensitive material printed at the company's plants.    The case, in which Donnelley printers are suspected to have sold advance excerpts of Business Week magazine to securities brokers, is prompting similar reviews by other financial publishers and printers. Executives at Forbes, Fortune and Money magazines said this week they are reviewing security safeguards. Brown Printing Co., the Wauseca, Minn., concern that prints Fortune, is reminding its workers that &quot;nothing leaves the plant,&quot; said a spokesman.    But at Donnelley -- where employees are also under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission -- and elsewhere in the printing and publishing industry, executives say there is little they can do to deter an unethical employee bent on abusing information gleaned on the job. Magazines go to press as much as a week before they're available to the public, and both printers and postal workers have access to their contents. Security guards, plant-access restrictions and signed promises by employees can't prevent theft of information, the executives say.    &quot;All you really need to do something like this is to fold up a few pages {of a magazine} in your pocket,&quot; says Arthur Prine Jr., Donnelley's vice president for corporate relations. &quot;It's hard to catch.&quot; Adds an official of one business periodical: &quot;Frankly, I'm sure there's a certain amount of trading on all financial magazines. But if someone makes one trade and disappears into a fog, it would be almost impossible to catch. We'll only know if they're greedy enough to fall into a pattern of continued illegal trading.&quot;    Donnelley had security measures in place at its plants. Only some of its employees, those working in restricted areas printing corporate proxy statements, were required to sign promises to maintain confidentiality. But the company's 24 plants have uniformed guards at every exit, plain-clothes guards walking production lines and rules that clothing carried out of the plant must be searched. Signs stressing confidentiality hang outside plant cafeterias.    Moreover, Donnelley, where employees sometimes sport T-shirts emblazoned, &quot;A perfect people,&quot; had a seemingly shining record. The last security breach executives can remember was in 1964, when a newspaper reporter sneaked into the Chicago plant to try to swipe an advance copy of Look magazine with excerpts from a highly publicized book about the late President John F. Kennedy. In a memo this week, Donnelley reminded its sales managers that the company's confidentiality record &quot;is unblemished&quot; in recent decades.    Nevertheless, Donnelley said yesterday that as a result of its continuing investigation into the alleged improper use of material from Business Week's &quot;Inside Wall Street&quot; column, it fired a previously suspended employee at its Torrance, Calif., plant, as well as two employees at its Old Saybrook, Conn., plant. It also said that as a result of the inquiry, another Torrance employee has resigned. The company said it is exploring pressing charges against any employees alleged to have stolen or passed along confidential material.    The scandal has sent shock waves through Donnelley. Executives could neither predict how long their internal investigation will go on, nor would they say whether they have any specific proposals to tighten security. Some of Donnelley's 24,000 employees are worried that the company will lose the business of some of the 250 magazines it prints.    Meanwhile, editors at Fortune, Forbes and Money magazines said they are reviewing security measures, spot-checking for prepublication price movement on stocks mentioned in recent issues, and reminding printers that leaks can violate federal securities laws.    Money and Forbes magazine executives have reminded their printer, World Color Press in Effingham, Ill., that no magazines should leave the plant before mailing day. &quot;Of course, you can't keep every issue under lock and key,&quot; said Landon Y. Jones, managing editor at Money, which carries a &quot;Wall Street&quot; column discussing analysts' latest stock picks.    And &quot;there's a long stretch before it truly becomes public information,&quot; he added. This month, some copies of Money will be printed as many as eight days before they go on newsstands Aug. 29. Fortune, a fortnightly whose &quot;Companies to Watch&quot; column often discusses small, thinly traded issues that sometimes swing widely in price after publicity, is printed on weekends and doesn't reach subscribers until the following Thursday.    Privately, some publishing executives worry that the Donnelley case will lead to more such incidents. &quot;This could alert a lot of people to the illegal possibilities, who may not already be aware of them,&quot; says Gary Belis, a Fortune spokesman. </TEXT></DOC>
