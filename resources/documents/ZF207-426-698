WMI bought a 22 percent stake for $250 million.andM;When Koche looks at prospective acquisitions in a new line of business, heuses Dialog to screen companies by type of business, earnings, location, andother factors.andP;  &quot;Dialog gives me power to sort out unqualified candidates andproduce a tightly focused 'hit list' of attractive companies,&quot; he says.andP;  Whena company is selected, Koche uses Dun andamp; Bradstreet's online credit reportingservice to determine the quarry's financial status.andM;Some services provide an astounding level of detail, marvels Koche.andP;  UsingLexis/Nexis for example, he can find not only what line of business a companyis in but also what it's doing right now.andP;  Lexis/Nexis indexes companiesaccording to thousands of product and event codes.andP;  &quot;I can ask for all thepaper companies in North America building new plants,&quot; Koche says.andM;Koche does not use CD-ROMs or other PC-based information retrieval products.andO;Despite lower usage costs, &quot;CD-ROM is not a good value for us,&quot; he explains.andO;&quot;CD-ROM information is often 30 or more days old.andP;  That's just not goodenough.&quot;andM;Koche also eschews menuing packages and enhancements designed to make onlineservices easier to use.andP;  &quot;I use Smartcom II.andP;  Anything else just slows medown,&quot; says the six-year PC veteran, although he adds that he wouldn't mindseeing an occasional chart or picture in addition to the raw text andnumbers.andM;&quot;My job couldn't be done without online services,&quot; Koche says, noting thatthose services will play an even more important role in the future.andP;  Withtighter regulation of trash disposal, WMI needs to be sure that itsacquisition targets are well managed and have track records of compliancewith pollution laws.andP;  Koche laments that online services can't tell him muchabout a company's ethics.andP;  But, he says, &quot;they can tell us just abouteverything else.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
