A statement from the military command read to reporters bytelephone said Israel questioned the ``credibility and source'' ofrecent reports from Lebanon that the navigator Ron Arad, 30, was inpoor health.   But it said: ``Israel stresses and reiterates it considers theAmal organization, and its leader, (Lebanese Justice Minister)Nabih Berri, responsible for the health and safety of the navigatorand hopes all necessary steps will be taken in keeping with thisresponsibility.   ``Israel will continue to work to return the navigator safe andsound as soon as possible,'' said the statement, which also wasbroadcast by Israel radio.   Lebanese miltiamen shot down Arad's phantom fighter with ashoulder-launched SAM-7 missile during an Oct. 16 bombing missionin south Lebanon. The pilot was rescued by helicopter.   After his capture, Israel announced that Arad was being held byAmal, a Shiite Moslem group and rival to the pro-Iranian HezbollahMovement.   The army's statement follows a radio appeal by Arad's wife,Tami, who said she and their 3-year-old daughter had not receivedany information about her husband in more than a year.   ``The hardest thing is the uncertainty and lack of contact,''Mrs. Arad told Israel army radio on July 21. ``If I could only knowhow he is, and what he does, and whether he's in good health, itwould be easier.''   She also urged her husband to be strong. ``We shall doeverything so that we can be together soon,'' she said. ``Webelieve in you and cross our fingers for you.''   Five other Israelis are missing in action in Lebanon.   Two, captured in 1986, are believed held by Hezbollah. Threeothers have been reported missing since a tank battle with Syrianforces in eastern Lebanon on June 11, 1982.</TEXT></DOC>
