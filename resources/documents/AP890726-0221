Bloch espionage case.   In unusually harsh language, the committee said ``bureaucraticinfighting'' has paralyzed the new Security Evaluation Office,established last year under CIA Director William Webster to bolsteranti-spy efforts at U.S. embassies around the world.   ``It has failed to achieve its objectives,'' the panel said inan assessment written before last week's public revelation thatBloch, once the No. 2 official at the U.S. Embassy in Vienna, wasunder investigation for allegedly passing secrets to the SovietUnion. Ranking committee members had been informed of the Blochcase, absent his name, in late June.   While the report deals mainly with technological efforts tothwart spying at U.S. posts abroad, it highlights the StateDepartment's longstanding reputation among intelligenceprofessionals for giving short shrift to security.</TEXT><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A survey of cardiac specialists suggests thatas many as 3,000 patients may have died prematurely after takingheartbeat control drugs that were found to increase risk of suddendeath among some types of patients.   Dr. Joel Morganroth, professor of medicine at the University ofPennsylvania, said he estimated the toll after surveying 1,000cardiologists to learn how many prescribed encainide or flecainidefor patients who had mild heartbeat irregularities after recoveringfrom a heart attack.   Morganroth, who also is director of cardiac research at GraduateHospital in Philadelphia, said the estimate of 3,000 prematuredeaths was a rough number.   ``Let's call that the worst scenario,'' he said.</TEXT><DATELINE>BAR HARBOR, Maine (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Many puzzling cancers and inheriteddiseases might be explained by a radical new finding that not allgenes are created equal: Genes passed on by fathers may bedifferent from those passed on by mothers.   Researchers are beginning to accept evidence that began toappear in the early 1980s suggesting that mothers and fathers each``imprint'' genes with different signals before passing them on totheir children.   The findings contradict one of the principles of geneticsestablished in the last century by Gregor Mendel _ that it made nodifference to a child whether it inherited a genetic trait from itsmother or its father.   That now seems wrong. Genetic imprinting by mothers and fathersmay be responsible for many kinds of cancer and inherited diseases,said Dr. Judith Hall of the University of British Columbia inCanada.</TEXT><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   President Bush hopes tough talk will forceforeign governments to stop subsidizing their domestic steelindustries, but lawmakers in U.S. steel states remain skeptical.
