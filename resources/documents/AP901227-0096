(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   New York state's top court Thursday threwout a $30 million lawsuit filed against Omni magazine by a coupleangered that their family photo illustrated an article aboutcoffee's effect on fertility.   The state Court of Appeals said in a unanimous decision it wasreluctant to second-guess an editorial decision. Trial level andappellate courts also had rejected the family's lawsuit.   Joseph and Ida Finger of Saugerties, N.Y., and their sixchildren were pictured beside an article titled ``Caffeine and FastSperm'' in Omni's June 1988 issue. The article discussed medicalresearch that indicated in vitro fertilization rates may beenhanced by exposing sperm to high concentrations of caffeine.   ``Want a big family?'' the photograph's caption read. ``Maybeyour sperm needs a cup of java in the morning. Tests reveal thatcaffeine-spritzed sperm swim faster, which may increase the chancesfor in vitro fertilization.''   The couple, who conceived their children naturally, had beenphotographed for an article in a Catholic publication, said theirlawyer, Paul Gruner. They weren't aware that a photo service hadgiven their picture to Omni until a friend showed Mrs. Finger themagazine, he said.   ``When it became known in a small community, the children werethe subject of some ridicule,'' Gruner said.   The couple argued that their civil rights were violated becausethe picture was used without permission. State law prohibits theuse of a photograph without consent for purposes of advertising ortrade.   Court of Appeals Judge Fritz Alexander noted that courts haveconsistently refused to apply the civil rights law to newsarticles, limiting those interpretations to advertising.   ``Questions of `newsworthiness' are better left to reasonableeditorial judgment and discretion,'' Alexander wrote.   Alexander said the Fingers had a misperception about the themeof the article, which the judge said was more about increasedfertility than in vitro or ``test tube'' fertilization.   The judge said there's clearly a ``real relationship'' betweenthe fertility theme and a picture of six healthy, attractivechildren who all bear a striking resemblance to their parents.   Laura Handman, lawyer for Omni, said the article made it veryclear that the medical findings are only in the laboratory stages.   ``You have to assume a certain degree of common sense by thereader,'' Handman said. ``I don't think there's been any familycreated by six cases of in vitro fertilization - coffee or nocoffee.''   But Gruner said the decision gives the press too much freedom touse pictures of people with articles that have nothing to do withthem.</TEXT></DOC>
