But the prosperity of the 1980striggered an unprecedented free-agent market forheavy-hitters.   &quot;The rainmaker became venerated and was carried around ona sedan chair,&quot; says Don Reuben, a well-known Chicagorainmaker.   The recent economic plunge has resulted in another wave ofpartner defections, in which partners of foundering firmsjump ship for healthier operations.   &quot;Now partners are coming to us and saying `I'm concernedabout the future,'&quot; says legal recruiter Bobbie McMorrow ofMcMorrow Associates Inc. in Los Angeles. And profitable firmsare trying to fill specific needs by recruiting from troubledfirms, she says.   Lawyers and recruiters familiar with the volatile marketfor rainmakers say, like a 500-pound gorilla, it is almostimpossible to placate or restrain them. But law firm managersare experimenting with ways to make itchy rainmakers thinktwice before they bolt.   Haight, Brown andamp; Bonesteel, a Santa Monica, Calif., lawfirm, had mixed results when it tried to enforce thenon-compete clause in its partnership agreement after apartner quit and took two key clients.   Robert L. Dickson, a lawyer at the firm for more than 20years, in 1988 opened a competing firm across the street. Hetook with him 21 lawyers and accounts valued at about 22% ofhis old firm's $6 million in billings, says Haight, Brownpartner Roy Weatherup.   Haight Brown sued Mr. Dickson for breaching itspartnership agreement, which denied him his share of profitsand made him liable for partnership debts if he left andcompeted with the firm. Mr. Dickson countered that theagreement was an illegal restraint of competition andviolated the lawyers' rules of ethics.   Last month, the California Supreme Court ruled that thecontract wasn't invalid because it didn't keep attorneys frompracticing altogether. The case will go to trial on theagreement's specific provisions. If he loses, Mr. Dickson andsix partners who left with him may have to pay their old firmas much as $1.2 million.   The decision was a victory for law firm management. But itsharply contrasts with a ruling by New York's highest court,which three years ago voided a similar partnership agreementof Lord, Day andamp; Lord. Courts in Oregon, Tennessee and Iowahave since agreed with the New York decision. Mr. Weatheruppoints out, however, that about 20 states have laws similarto California's, which allows professionals and businesses toenforce non-compete contracts.   Leslie David Corwin, of the New York law firm MorrisonCohen Singer andamp; Weinstein, who specializes in partnership law,says that several New York law firms have tried to get aroundthe Lord, Day decision by redrafting provisions so that theydon't look like non-compete clauses. Some, Mr. Corwin says,link retirement benefits and returns on a partner'sinvestment in the firm to a long tenure.   Some firms also have adopted agreements enabling apartnership to dissolve and force the defecting partner toshare responsibility for all of the firm's debts, Mr. Corwinsays. The most effective provision, he says, subtracts adeparting partner's share of the firm's debt for its leasefrom any money he is owed.   Stephen Harmelin, managing partner of Dilworth, Paxson,Kalish andamp; Kauffman in Philadelphia, predicts that, &quot;As theeconomy gets worse, I suspect the courts will be moresympathetic to the enforcement of these kinds of provisions.&quot;His firm almost lost its key rainmaker, Bruce W. Kauffman, toanother firm last year.   Mr. Dickson, formerly of Haight, Brown, scoffs at thenotion that a restrictive partnership agreement will act as adeterrent to defections. &quot;If a partner wants to leave, he'llleave,&quot; he says.   Ultimately, a client decides whether to switch law firms,and so some firms, such as Winston andamp; Strawn in Chicago, aretrying to wed clients to more than one partner bycross-pollinating relationships. A client who is happy withwork performed by several partners, isn't likely to changefirms and at worst will split its work.   The strategy, says Winston andamp; Strawn managing partner GaryFairchild, is &quot;to expose clients to an array of additionalparties&quot; and services through training programs andnewsletters. Some firms, says Larry Cesare, a legal recruiterin Philadelphia, send flowers and birthday cards toexecutives' wives as a way to nurture friendly relationships.   But Jim Agger, general counsel at Air Products andamp; Chemicalsin Allentown, Pa., says those kinds of marketing programswork well only if the partner who brought in the clientcooperates.   Morgan, Lewis andamp; Bockius tries to dodge that problem bycarefully screening partners it brings in from other firms.&quot;We have turned down a lawyer with $5 million in businessbecause he was not interested in working with a group,&quot; saysSamuel B. Fortenbaugh III, chairman of the Philadelphia firm.   Ward Bower, a law firm consultant, says some market forcesare working in management's favor. In the 1980s, he says,some defectors exaggerated their clients' billings. To avoidbeing burned, firms now scrutinize records and seekassurances from clients that they will change firms.   Last year Mr. Kauffman, Dilworth, Paxson's chairman,decided not to jump ship after negotiating with another firm.Mr. Kauffman says he responded to a management technique nottypically found in partnership agreements -- guilt and asense of obligation. His partners, Mr. Kauffman says,convinced him that if he stayed, they would make the firmmore profitable by cutting costs.   &quot;I felt an obligation to stay with the firm, unlike a lotof lawyers in this world today,&quot; Mr. Kauffman says. &quot;I didn'twant to take the chance that the firm would fail.&quot;   ---   AIDS IS THE MOST LITIGATED disease ever, according toHarvard study.   In a report for the AIDS Litigation Project, the HarvardSchool of Public Health said that nearly 1,000 cases relatedto acquired immune-deficiency syndrome are either pending orhave been decided nationwide. The AIDS Litigation Project ispart of the U.S. Public Health Service.   The study found that since 1989 the largest number ofcases, which also include complaints filed with state andlocal human-rights commissions, involved discriminationagainst people with AIDS. Two other major areas of litigationinvolved blood transfusions and criminal prosecutions ofpeople accused of threatening to transmit the disease toothers.   Because courts have generally found that people with AIDSare protected from job and housing discrimination, LarryGostin, professor of health law and author of the report,said he expects future suits to deal more with access tohealth care and insurance coverage. &quot;I think insurance willbe very heavily litigated,&quot; he said in an interview,particularly as companies try to cut benefits for workersinfected with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS.   Prof. Gostin said another increasing area of litigationinvolves civil suits brought by people claiming they wereexposed to the virus during sex. &quot;Tort litigation amongsexual partners is also expanding with the HIV epidemic,&quot; thereport said. &quot;Courts have continued to allow private tortactions based on the premise that a partner negligently orintentionally transmitted a venereal disease.&quot;   Similar suits, arguing that people infected with HIV havea &quot;duty to warn,&quot; also are being brought by police andemergency-care workers against prisoners and patients, Prof.Gostin said.   He also said the study found that court decisions oftenappear to be based more on fears and stereotypes about AIDSthan on medical facts. For instance, he said that in manycases where a person with AIDS allegedly exposed anotherperson to the disease, harsh criminal sentences have beenhanded down even though there was no real risk oftransmission.   ---   SCHOOL ASBESTOS TRIAL is put on hold.   The case will be postponed pending a review by a federalappeals court panel of allegations made by defense lawyersthat the trial judge's actions have led to an appearance ofbias. The appeals court could appoint another judge to hearthe case.   A jury trial in the eight-year-old class action by 35,000public and private schools against nearly 30 manufacturers ofasbestos products had been scheduled for Feb. 3. In one ofthe most complex product-liability cases pending in thecountry, the schools are seeking reimbursement for the costsof testing and removing asbestos, as well as punitivedamages.   U.S. District Judge James M. Kelly of Philadelphia decidedto stay the trial after the Third Circuit Court of Appealsordered a review of his decision to attend a June 1990conference on asbestos disease sponsored by the New YorkAcademy of Science and the Collegium Ramazzini, a scientificassociation. Thirteen experts who were working with theplaintiffs spoke at the conference. Judge Kelly later saidthey wouldn't be allowed to testify at the trial in order toavoid any perception of bias.   Charles Bruton, an attorney at Schnader, Harrison, Segal andamp;Lewis which represents defendant Pfizer Inc., said he askedthe Third Circuit to review Judge Kelly's actions because&quot;there is an appearance of impropriety and my client has aright to a new referee.&quot; Mr. Bruton said he didn't expect theappeals court's review to be completed until the spring.   David Berger, co-lead counsel for the schools, said thathe didn't believe Judge Kelly was biased. &quot;It's a smokescreen of the obvious kind,&quot; Mr. Berger said, adding that thedefendants are trying to delay the trial for as long aspossible.

A Legal Beat column on Jan. 20incorrectly stated that it had. The decision referred to inthe column was a September opinion from a Californiaintermediate appellate court, which the state's Supreme Courtin December declined to review. The column also misstated themaximum amount Robert L. Dickson and his six partners couldend up having to pay their former partners at Haight, Brown andamp;Bonesteel. The correct amount is about $250,000.   (WSJ Jan. 31, 1992)   920120-0127</TEXT></DOC>
