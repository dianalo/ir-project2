The oil ministers said they would resume their debate Sundaynight.   Eight of OPEC's 13 member nations backed a proposed two-monthcut of 300,000 barrels a day in the cartel's production thatanalysts said could raise gasoline prices by 2.5 cents a gallon.   But Gholamreza Aghazadeh, the Iranian oil minister, said SaudiArabia and three other Persian Gulf Arab states rejected the plan.The Saudis proposed that the Organization of Petroleum ExportingCountries cut only about 200,000 barrels a day, he said.   The Saudi idea was rejected by the eight-country majority, andthe talks adjourned in the early hours Sunday. The ministers havebeen meeting since Thursday.   ``We're still studying the issue,'' said Hisham Nazer, the Saudioil minister, as he left the 3{-hour meeting. He declined to saymore.   The other three holdouts are Kuwait, Qatar and the United ArabEmirates, whose oil ministers also have said they needed more timeto consult with their governments. The 13th member not voting onthe proposal is Iraq, which normally does not follow OPEC'sproduction quotas.   The Venezuelan oil minister, Arturo Hernandez Grisanti, said thecartel leaders were still stuck ``on the same questions.''   ``We are giving time to the four (gulf Arab) countries to thinkagain about the proposal,'' Hernandez said.   Several officials, including Iran's Aghazadeh, said the Saudisinsisted any cuts in production be shared equally rather thanfollowing the usual practice of assigning cuts in accordance witheach member's share of current OPEC production.   In other words the Saudis insisted that Gabon, which pumps only150,000 barrels a day, cut as much as Saudi Arabia, which produces4.3 million barrels daily.   Analysts and OPEC officials said the proposal to cut OPECproduction by 300,000 barrels, or 2 percent, could boost oil pricesby as much as $1 a barrel, meaning an increase of 2.5 cents pergallon at the gasoline pump.   OPEC oil currently is selling for $14 to $16 per 42-gallonbarrel, well below its target of $18 a barrel.   The Saudis' proposal to cut output by 200,000 barrels a daywould match the reduction that a group of six non-OPEC producershas offered to make in tandem with the cartel, according todelegation sources.   They reported the Saudis said they would be willing to acceptthe 300,000 figure if the non-OPEC group raised its cutback offerto that level.   The six non-OPEC nations include Mexico, Egypt, China, Oman,Angola and Malaysia.   Taken together, the cuts would represent a loss of only about 1percent of oil supplies in the non-communist world.   Normally, a cutback that small would have little or no effect onprices. But analysts said the psychology of the market is such thatany agreement on production restraint between OPEC and the non-OPECgroup would give at least a modest boost to prices.   Paul McDonald, a London-based oil consultant, said prices couldrise as much as $1 a barrel in the very short term.   ``It's sheer genius, as far as getting them over the next twomonths'' when oil markets were expected to be weak, McDonald saidin a telephone interview.   By June, oil demand in the industrialized countries is expectedto pick up a little, putting less pressure on OPEC to restrain itsproduction, he said.   If the Vienna talks ended without agreement, however, priceswould be expected to fall sharply, analysts said.   The proposed mutual cuts in oil output were easy for most OPECmembers to accept, partly because they are so small and of suchshort duration that it would be virtually impossible to verifywhether any of the cuts were actually made.   ``The whole thing is a nonsense'' in terms of actually changingthe balance of supply and demand, McDonald said.   OPEC leaders insisted, however, that the proposed cuts would beimportant.   ``If one cuts by (a combined) 500,000 barrels a day the marketwould stabilize,'' Etienne Tchioba, the oil minister of Gabon, saidin an interview.   Other cartel officials acknowledged that the proposed cuts weremore imagined than real.   ``It's only psychological,'' said one senior OPEC official,speaking on condition he not be further identified.   The main aim of the proposal was to establish a precedent formutual production cuts with the non-OPEC nations.   If this could be repeated later, or widened to include moreindependent producers, OPEC could have an easier time stabilizingoil prices around its target of $18 a barrel.</TEXT></DOC>
