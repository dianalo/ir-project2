The agreement, which still faces a design review by cityplanners, appears to end a 37-year squabble over how the87-acre, city-owned tract south of historic Market Streetshould be revitalized. Olympia andamp; York was chosen 10 years agoas designer and developer. Talks between the city and Olympiaandamp; York started and failed several times over the decade.</LP><TEXT>   As the first mega-project approved since October'searthquake, the development is seen as a great boost to SanFrancisco's business fortunes and public image.   Critical to resolving the impasse over the Yerba BuenaGardens project were trade-offs that call for theToronto-based developer to fund up front about $110 millionin public improvements, including a huge park and esplanade,within the redevelopment area. In exchange, the city hasgranted Olympia andamp; York permission to build three high-riseoffice buildings, comprising about 1.6 million square feet,under a flexible schedule extending until the end of 1999.   The approval comes at a time of flat demand in the city'scommerical office-space market, but &quot;the key is theflexibility the agreement gives us,&quot; said Albert Reichmann,Olympia andamp; York's chairman, in an interview.   Thus, while the market here &quot;is not so strong that I wouldstart a speculative building now,&quot; Olympia andamp; York will haveample time to find &quot;a sizable tenant&quot; to anchor the first ofits high-rises prior to beginning construction, Mr. Reichmannsaid. The developer hopes to break ground on the first ofthose buildings in 1993.   The high-rise agreement is also important in that itessentially grants Olympia andamp; York an exemption from arecently adopted citizens initiative that put a cap of400,000 square feet a year on new commercial projects.   But Olympia andamp; York was forced to concede ground in otherareas. It essentially &quot;decommercialized&quot; two large blocks ofthe development, abandoning plans for a privately operatedamusement park; it also greatly scaled down an originalproposal that would have allowed it to construct about250,000 square feet of retail space in the project. Instead,most of those areas will now be dedicated to &quot;public places,&quot;including a children's park and museum, said Sandy Frucher,an Olympia andamp; York executive vice president.   Mr. Reichmann gave Mayor Art Agnos a check for $4.2million, representing a &quot;good faith payment&quot; toward the $110million total that will allow the city to begin planning andbuilding the the project's public amenities. The core ofthose components, a 10-acre public park, will be built atopthe roof of an addition to the city's Moscone Civic Center.That addition, currently under construction, is expected tobe completed next summer, allowing park construction to beginthen, city officials said.   Olympia andamp; York is a closely held real estate developmentconcern; its other current projects include the12-million-square-foot Canary Wharf office space complex inLondon.</TEXT></DOC>
