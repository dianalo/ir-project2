The figures are still subject to the approval of the fullcommittee, but senior members gave their blessing at aclosed-door meeting yesterday and will begin drafting majorbills as early as today for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1.</LP><TEXT>   Nearly $523 billion in discretionary appropriations arewithin the committee's jurisdiction, and while Pentagon andforeign aid allocations are largely fixed by last fall'sdeficit pact, the panel retains broad discretion inallocating domestic funds.   Under yesterday's plan, an estimated $63.6 billion isprovided to cover not only space but housing, veterans, andenvironmental regulation departments and agencies -- $1.3billion less than President Bush had requested. Elsewhere,the leadership went beyond the administration in providingnearly $59.3 billion for labor, health, and educationprograms, but spending would still fall below the increasespromised in the budget resolution.   Though health and education have traditionally been strongDemocratic priorities, there is increased pressure to slowgrowth in these areas, given the fixed spending caps. SenateAppropriations Committee Chairman Robert Byrd (D., W.Va.) isapplying pressure behind the scenes to trim even further inthese areas to accommodate more for energy and water programsand law enforcement.   A master of pork-barrel politics, Mr. Byrd has a parochialinterest in both areas. The energy and water accounts fundcostly dam and road projects in his home state of WestVirginia, and, within the Justice Department budget, thechairman has a major stake in a Federal Bureau ofInvestigation fingerprint facility to be located in hisstate. An estimated $185 million was approved last year forthis purpose at Mr. Byrd's request, and FBI officialsrecently testified that they would like another $48 millionnot in the administration's 1992 budget to begin developing afingerprint-identification computer system that will costhundreds of millions of dollars before completion.   This maneuvering receives little public attention, but theallocations now frame all of the major choices ahead for thesubcommittees. The space budget will be taken up today, andto an unusual degree, the president directly involved himselfthrough a written appeal this week asking for &quot;specialconsideration&quot; for the National Aeronautics and SpaceAdministration.   Though less severe than some had predicted, the cutadopted yesterday still poses problems because there isstrong pressure to protect housing and veterans medical carefunctions in the same bill. Similarly, allocations for energyand water and natural resources belie the problems ahead. Forexample, the energy and water total of $9.75 billion is only$80 million less than the president's request, but lawmakersmust struggle to satisfy the Energy Department's burgeoningscience projects and still restore hundreds in millions ofdollars in water projects not included by Mr. Bush.</TEXT></DOC>
