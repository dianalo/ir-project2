(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A crowd of about 1,000 opponentsof Indian spearfishing treaty rights gathered Friday night and morethan 100 were arrested after protesters surged across a police line.   Police used vans and a school bus to haul those arrest away froma boat landing at Trout Lake just hours after a federal judgerefused to order the Chippewa Indians to stop their spearfishing.   A crowd, mainly protesters but including some treaty-rightssupporters, gathered on the eve of the state's generalhook-and-line sports fishing season opener.   At about 8:15 p.m., a group of protesters, many of them wavingAmerican flags and some shouting ``Equal Rights'' crossed thepolice line.   The spearfishing supporters, who were not involved in theactivities that led to the arrests, appeared at the boat landing toshow support for the Chippewa, who exercising fishing rightsretained in 19th century treaties in which the tribe gave up itstitle to the northern part of Wisconsin.   The protest came after U.S. District Judge Barbara Crabb refusedFriday to grant a state request for an order to halt the spearingbefore sport anglers open their season Saturday.   State officials made the request because of concerns about theability of police to maintain public safety because of the tensionsover the traditional Chippewa fishing.   Tribal members have faced crowds of hundreds of protesters, someshouting racial slurs and throwing rocks, during the spearingseason that began April 23. There had been more than 100 arrestsbefore Friday's.   This is the fifth year Wisconsin's six Chippewa bands havespeared walleye from northern Wisconsin lakes since a federal courtruled the tribe retained the rights to hunt, fish and gather wildgrain under 19th century treaties that ceded land to the UnitedStates.   Tensions over the spring spearfishing have increased each year.They have heightened this year after the state reduced thesportfishing walleye catch limit on the 254 lakes the tribe hastargeted for possible spearing.</TEXT></DOC>
