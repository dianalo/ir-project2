KNUTSON</NOTE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Senate Foreign Relations Committee on a 10to 9 party-line vote today approved and sent to the Senate floorlegislation imposing harsh economic sanctions againstwhite-dominated South Africa.   Immediately after the vote, leading Senate Democrats hailed theaction as an important step against South Africa's system of racialapartheid and Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., called on Republicanpresidential candidate George Bush to reverse course and support it.   ``We would certainly welcome his support on this measure,''Kennedy said. ``We have welcomed other election-year conversions onthe part of Mr. Bush. He has indicated he wanted to broaden hismandate. He has an excellent opportunity to speak to that issue.''   Bush has opposed the legislation which would impose a near-totaltrade embargo against South Africa and require the withdrawal ofall U.S. business investment six months to a year after enactment.Democratic presidential candidate Michael Dukakis has supported thebill's attempt to increase the cost of maintaining apartheid on theSouth African government.   Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., a principal author of thesanctions bill, told reporters that if Republicans maintain a solidfront against the measure it will be difficult to cut off athreatened filibuster against it or to override a likely veto byPresident Reagan should it be approved.   He said the Senate's Democratic leadership might considerattaching the sanctions bill as an amendment to some otherlegislation in an effort to assure there is a recorded Senate voteon sanctions before Congress adjourns next month.   The committee vote took place after Cranston modified the billto remove a provision that could have caused foreign oil companiesto lose American oil leases if they acted to undercut the sanctionslegislation.   Opponents of the measure had said they feared the provisionmight cause retaliation by other countries against American oilcopmpanies, especially those active in oil exploration and drillingin British territorial waters in the North Sea.   Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., the committee's ranking GOP member andleading opponent of sanctions legislation, complained that Cranstonwas unfairly violating a committee agreement and moving to change abill Helms called a ``turkey.''   ``It's a one-legged turkey that I knew was going to hop around,but it's going nowhere,'' Helms said. Supporters have admitted theydo not have the votes needed to cut off Senate debate and force avote or the votes to override a near-certain presidential veto ifit passes.   Cranston said he had the right to modify the legislation sincehe sponsored it and said: ``Sen. Helms wants to do nothing toimprove the bill and nothing to move against apartheid.''   The committee's 10 Democrats voted for the measure and the nineRepublicans against it.   The bill, intended as a follow-up to a set of milder sanctionsenacted over a Reagan veto in 1986, would require an end to mosttrade with South Africa and the withdrawal of most U.S. businessinvestment from the racially divided nation.   The House approved similar legislation on Aug. 11.   Republican opponents of the measure passed up an opportunitylast week to vote on amendments as some GOP senators said changesmight make the bill more acceptable and therefore harder to oppose.   The 1986 sanctions bill was supported by a broad coalition ofsenators from both parties.   But only a few Republicans have indicated they are ready tosupport a stronger set of sanctions, with some contending that atrade embargo and disinvestment would end any leverage the UnitedStates may have to encourage Pretoria to end the country's systemof forced racial separation and control known as apartheid.   They also said that adopting the sanctions bill now wouldforeclose the options of the next president whether he beRepublican George Bush, who opposes sanctions, or Democrat MichaelDukakis, who favors them.   The State Department also opposes the legislation, contendingits passage might disrupt U.S.-mediated talks among South Africa,Angola and Cuba aimed at South African withdrawal from theterritory of South West Africa, or Namibia, and the withdrawal ofCuban troops from Angola.   Democrats said the bill represents the only remaining means ofsending a strong signal to South Africa that the United States iswilling to pay a price to end the apartheid system.   They said the issue is a moral one, not political, and thatsanctions represent the only available way to forestall a violentrevolution inside South Africa by moving that country towardmultiracial democratic rule.</TEXT></DOC>
