Under 5 CFR 737.29, this change, therefore, is effectiveas to such persons only if they continue to hold positions within the ExecutiveOffice of the President for 5 months after June 16, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESS: </T2>Office of Government Ethics, P.O. Box 14108, Washington,DC 20044.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: </T2>Leslie Wilcox, (202) 523-5757.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</T2> Subsection 207(e) of title 18 U.S.C.gives the Director of the Office of Government Ethics authority to designatestatutory agencies or bureaus within a parent department or agency as separatefor the purpose of limiting the post employment restrictions of 18 U.S.C.207(c) applicable to former senior employees. Procedures and standardsunder which a parent agency may seek designation of separate statutorycomponents are set forth in 5 CFR 737.13(c). The effect of designationby the Director is to limit the restriction of 18 U.S.C. 207(c) to contactsby a former senior employee with the statutory component in which he/sheserved. Such designation, however, does not benefit former heads of theseparate subordinate agencies or former senior employees of the parentagency whose official responsibilities included supervision of the subordinateagency.In 1983, in response to a request from the Counsel to the President, theDirector of the Office of Government Ethics designated the following officesand councils within the Executive Office of the President as separate statutoryagencies:<ITAG tagnum="15">Office of Management and Budget </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Council of Economic Advisers </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">National Security Council </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">United States Trade Representative </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Council on Environmental Quality </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Office of Science and Technology Policy </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Office of Administration </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">White House Office and the Office of Policy Development </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Office of the Vice President</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">That determination is implemented in 5 CFR 737.31. On April 12, 1989, the Counsel to the President notified the Director ofthe Office of Government Ethics that the Executive Office of the Presidentshould be considered as a single agency for purposes of section 207(e).The letter noted that determinations of distinctness under that provisionare informed by the purpose of section 207(c), which is ``directed at unfairinfluence being exerted by a former official with the persons with whomhe had worked'', S. Rep. No. 95-170, 95th Cong., 1st Sess. 153 (1977);and that the spirit and purposes of section 207(c) and (e) dictated thatseparateness could be determined with reference to such factors as proximityand scope of interaction and not merely interchangeability of functions.It accordingly concluded that the Executive Office of the President, withits uniquely extensive responsibilities and degree of interaction, shouldbe considered as a single agency for purposes of section 207(e). It alsonoted, however, that this conclusion flowed from the present organizationof the Executive Office of the President and was accordingly subject tochange, and that it stemmed from the Executive Office of the President'sfunction as a unique locus of policy making for the entire spectrum ofissues confronting the Government, rather than from any conclusion thatthe functions of its particular components are interchangeable. Pursuantto these Presidential determinations, 5 CFR 737.31 is amended to deletethe Executive Office of the President and its subagencies from the listingof separate statutory components. Pursuant to section 553 of title 5 of the United States Code, I find thatgood cause exists to make this amendment effective in less than 30 daysfor persons entering on duty in senior employee positions within the ExecutiveOffice of the President on or after June 16, 1989. Under 5 CFR 737.29 thisregulation does not adversely affect persons holding senior employee positionsin the Executive Office of the President prior to June 16, 1989 unlessthey remain in such positions for an additional 5 months. Thus, the changehas an immediate impact only upon a limited class of persons who wouldnot ordinarily have formed specific expectations as to their rights uponleaving government employment and who would be unlikely to leave officeand be affected by the change within less than 30 days after June 16, 1989.<ITAG tagnum="84">E.O. 12291, Federal Regulations </ITAG>The Office of Government Ethics has determined that this is not a majorrule as defined under section 1(B) of E.O. 12291. <ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Flexibility Act  </ITAG>I certify that this regulation will not have a significant economic impacton a substantial number of small entities because it affects only Federalemployees. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 5 CFR Part 737 </ITAG>Conflicts of interest, Government employees.<ITAG tagnum="21">U.S. Office of Personnel Management. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Frank Q.
