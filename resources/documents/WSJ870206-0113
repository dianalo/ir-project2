The draft, released yesterday by the seven-member U.S. Sentencing Commission, allows judges to use probation and accept plea-bargaining agreements. It also permits judges to impose sentences that differ from the guidelines, as long as they give detailed, written reasons that may be reviewed on appeal.    The earlier draft, released last September, proposed far more rigid standards, leaving no room for the use of probation or plea bargaining. The September draft was praised by the Justice Department, but was widely criticized by judges, the American Bar Association and others as too complex and too inflexible.    The commission was created by Congress in 1984 to establish guidelines for federal criminal sentences in order to reduce the wide disparity in the frequency and length of prison terms for similar crimes. Once the commission adopts a final set of guidelines, possibly this spring, they will generally be binding on federal judges unless Congress disapproves or amends the proposal.    Commission officials said that one aim of the September draft and the latest version is to increase the likelihood that white-collar criminals and drug traffickers will spend time in prison.    According to the new draft, securities fraud, such as insider trading, might be more likely to result in a prison sentence than antitrust violations, such as price-fixing. In either case, the sentence may be increased because of the amount of money involved, because of past criminal convictions, or because the individual organized the illegal activity. For price-fixing, fines would be imposed in addition to possible prison terms.    For price-fixing involving less than $15 million in business, first-time offenders would fall within a sentencing range of two to eight months. In that range, the guidelines say judges may use various sentencing alternatives such as weekends in jail, living in a community treatment center, and confinement in one's own home.    If the volume of business involved in price-fixing exceeds $15 million, a first offender would have to serve at least eight months in prison, according to the guidelines.    For a first offender, insider trading involving a gain of less than $20,000 to the criminal might also be punished with the sentencing alternatives. But when the insider trader gains more than $20,000, the likelihood of a prison term increases, with a first offender serving a minimum of 21 months for an illegal profit of between $1 million and $2 million.    Federal appeals court Judge William Wilkins, the commission chairman, said the sentencing ranges are a &quot;consensus&quot; among the members. He said that compared with the draft's proposals, he favors a greater likelihood of prison for antitrust and securities law violators, among others. But Judge Wilkins said the probability of prison terms with the draft &quot;is an increase over current practices.&quot;    The guidelines are subject to a period of public comment, particularly by judges, lawyers and legislators, after which the commission is likely to make further changes.    Some criticism has already occurred. Commission member Paul Robinson, a professor at Rutgers University Law School in Camden, N.J., voted against releasing the draft. In a written dissent, he said the commission has abandoned the intent of Congress and has proposed a system that might increase, rather than reduce, disparity. &quot;Pretending to have disparity-reducing guidelines is worse than having no guidelines at all,&quot; Mr. Robinson wrote.    The commission has also voted to hold a hearing later this month on whether it should issue guidelines for use of the death penalty for such federal crimes as treason and espionage. The Justice Department has urged that death penalty regulations be included, but opponents say Congress never intended this and may block the entire set of sentencing guidelines if the death penalty is included.    If the new draft draws criticism, it won't be anything new to the commission. Beginning with a flap over who should serve on the commission that delayed its start for a year, running through criticism of the September draft, and continuing with the uproar over the death penalty, the panel has been continually tangled in controversy. </TEXT></DOC>
