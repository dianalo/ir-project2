In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, the group said it holds 453,300 Purolator common shares, including 393,300 shares purchased Jan. 12 through March 10 for $27.50 to $35.25 each.    According to the filing, the group bought its Purolator stock for investment purposes, but group members reserve the right to exercise their rights as Purolator shareholders &quot;in a manner consistent with their equity interests.&quot;    As previously reported, Basking Ridge, N.J.-based Purolator's board earlier this month agreed to be acquired by PC Acquisition Inc., which is owned by eight Purolator executives and E.F. Hutton LBO Inc., a unit of E.F. Hutton Group Inc., in a leveraged buyout valued at $35 a share.    The Mutual Shares group is studying the buyout offer and hasn't decided whether it will tender its shares or take any other action, the filing said.    The Mutual Shares group added that they may hold talks with Hutton or other interested shareholders in the future in connection with the group's investment in Purolator.    Officials for Purolator, a package delivery concern and maker of auto parts, declined to comment on the filing. </TEXT></DOC>
