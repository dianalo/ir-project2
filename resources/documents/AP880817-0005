Nearly 700 men of the Arce Infantry Battalion were brought inJuly 26, by helicopter because truck transport from their garrison35 miles to the south is considered too risky.   Soldiers of the Arce, and those of the Atlacatl battalion, areconsidered the army's most seasoned and efficient fighters.   The operation is the biggest of the past year around the town inMorazan province 125 miles northeast of San Salvador.   It is directed by a colonel, in line to become armed forcescommander, who combines battlefield offensives with political andsocial action designed to undermine peasant support for theguerrillas.   Leftist rebels have fought U.S.-backed Salvadoran governmentssince late 1979 in a civil war that has killed an estimated 65,000people, most of them civilians.   Col. Rene Emilio Ponce, eastern military zone commander anddirector of the Perquin campaign, said about 1,000 guerrillasoperate within a 20-mile radius of the town. He called that thedensest concentration of rebel fighters in El Salvador, a nation of5.5 million about the size of Massachussetts.   It is an area of forested mountains and jungled hollowsalternately baked by tropical sun and lashed by rainy-seasonstorms. Venceremos, the clandestine rebel radio, broadcasts fromnorthern Morazan.   Ponce and Lt. Col. Reynaldo Chavarria, the theater commanderstationed in Perquin, believe most of the rebels have retreatednorthward to, or across, the border with an isolated area ofHonduras where they sometimes take refuge.   A 15-mile patrol with Arce troopers over two days revealed ampleevidence of rebel presence, including mine fields, communicationlines and two brief skirmishes.   Ponce and Chavarria say the guerrillas have taken surprisinglylittle offensive action against the incursion into the heart of``liberated territory.''   They said that indicates weakness because the Arce patrols aresomewhat exposed and would seem to be attractive targets.   ``As we kill off their seasoned fighters, they are more and moredependent on young, ill-trained recruits, kids,'' Chavarria said.   He spoke on the stoop of his command post, an abandoned house onthe north side of a town square lined with facades pocked bybullets and mortar shells.   Directly across the square was a green house where guerrillacommander Joaquin Villalobos, the most wanted man in El Salvador,and his top officers held a news conference in March.   Lieutenants, non-commissioned officers and troopers who man thepatrols are not convinced of guerrilla weakness. The soldiers aretough, with high morale, but their nervousness and caution revealeda sense that attack always was imminent.   ``I've got the jitters,'' Lt. Ali Valdez whispered as the menpitched camp silently in the dark on Torola Hill at the end of aday's march.   ``This is very hostile country. We know it well, but los babosos(a disparaging term for the guerrillas) live here and know everysquare meter of it.''   The battalion lost two killed and 12 wounded in the first twoweeks, most of them from from mines or snipers. No guerrilla deathswere confirmed.   A Radio Venceremos broadcast Aug. 3 said: ``The Arce will haveto leave eventually, because they can't stay in Perquin forever.''   No one argues with that. Ponce says his men will stay ``as longas circumstances permit.''   Government forces have occupied Perquin several times during thewar but never for more than 10 weeks.   Chavarria and his officers said they think in terms of a monththis time, which puts limitations on Ponce's attempt to win thearea's approximately 800 peasants away from the rebel cause.   ``People will be reluctant to listen to us and collaborate aslong as they know that in a month we'll be gone and the subversiveswill be back,'' Chavarria said.   Earlier this month, Ponce took reporters by helicopter toPerquin for two hours, then to a town in neighboring San Miguelprovince where he and his men distributed food and medicine. Theylistened to requests from residents for a well, fertilizer and abridge over a nearby river.   He says the San Miguel area has become less of a guerrillabastion because of attention to the people's needs and wants.   ``We hurt the subversives much more by taking away their base ofsupport than by killing them,'' the colonel said.   Ponce said he plans such work in Perquin but it is difficultbecause years of war have made the people unresponsive.   The town's cobbled streets were nearly empty of civilians duringthe first week of the battalion's presence, Chavarria said, butactivity later returned to a semblance of normal.   During a reporter's visit, children played soccer in a clearingoff the square and about 20 people gathered for the slaughter of ayoung bull, waiting to buy some of the meat.   Pablo Argueta, a 45-year-old peasant with eight children, killedand butchered the animal.   ``We're caught in the middle,'' he said. ``We don't wantproblems with either side. We just want the war to end so we canwork in peace.''</TEXT></DOC>
