Leo R. Fink, chairman and chief executive officer, and Edward S. Gordon, an investor, have offered $22 a share, or $11.8 million, for the 20% of the 2.7 million shares outstanding they don't already control.    In March, a minority shareholder, Barry Pinkowitz, filed a class-action suit to block the offer, to ensure &quot;full and fair value for the outstanding shares&quot; of the parking facility operator.    In a leveraged buy-out, a small group of investors acquires a company in a transaction financed largely by borrowing. Ultimately, the debt is paid with funds generated by the acquired company's operations or sale of its assets.    On Friday, Meyers was quoted at $22 bid in over-the-counter trading. </TEXT></DOC>
