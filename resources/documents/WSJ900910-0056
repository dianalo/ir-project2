Leading producers are starting to make good on promises topump more crude to replace embargoed Iraqi and Kuwaiti oil,according to those who monitor OPEC output. They said,however, that total OPEC production probably won't reachpre-crisis levels of more than 23 million barrels a day untillate in the year, if then.</LP><TEXT>   An anticipated gap in total crude oil supplies this month,caused by the six-week shipping lag for Middle East oil toreach world markets, isn't expected to be a large problem,industry analysts said. Crude inventories, particularly inthe U.S., are high. If tight supplies or shortages do appear,they'll probably involve only some refined products and someregions, the analysts said.   &quot;There could be product imbalances,&quot; said Cristina Haus,who monitors OPEC production for Washington-based EnergySecurity Analysis. &quot;There will be no problem in crude oil.&quot;In addition to an increase of as much as two million barrelsa day in crude oil produced by Saudi Arabia, she said sheforesees the September output increase by the United ArabEmirates to be more than the generally estimated 500,000barrels a day.   She placed total OPEC September production as high as 21.9million barrels a day.   &quot;We are seeing a steady rise for September,&quot; added ConradGerber, president of Petro-Logistics Ltd. of Geneva, who alsotracks OPEC output. He estimated total September OPEC outputshould be at least 21.5 million barrels a day, and said &quot;itcould hit 22 million barrels a day for October.&quot; Hemaintained, however, &quot;that is the maximum.&quot;   Whatever the September level, it will show a sharp risefrom last month. For August, according to the figuresreleased last week by the International Energy Agency, OPECproduction dropped to the year's low of 19.7 million barrelsa day from more than 23 million barrels a day in thepreceding months.   The September increase will fall short of meeting demandfor OPEC oil, estimated by energy economists at around 23million barrels a day for the remainder of the year. Thatsuggests pricing volatility and big draws of inventories --or &quot;stocks&quot; -- even after the additional crude beginsreaching the Western oil-consuming nations.   Oil prices, which have climbed nearly 50% since Iraqinvaded Kuwait, fell Friday on profit-taking. In U.S. futurestrading, October crude dropped $1.39 to $30.04 a barrel,leaving it up $2.72 a barrel for the holiday-shortened week.The biggest gain of the week, $1.66 a barrel on Thursday,came the day after the weekly report of the AmericanPetroleum Institute. That report showed U.S. crudeinventories declined 4.4 million barrels the preceding week.   World-wide inventory reductions averaged some 300,000barrels a day last month, according to the Paris-based IEA,the energy watchdog agency for the Western oil-consumingnations. For September, IEA and industry officials anticipatebigger withdrawals, probably as much as one million barrels aday and reaching higher amounts as winter nears.   &quot;There could be something like a 2.1 million{barrels-per-day} stock draw over the fourth quarter,&quot; saidRoger Benedict, an editor with Energy Information Ltd., whichprovides analysis of oil industry news. &quot;The real crunchcould be from November on,&quot; he added. &quot;A lot depends on howcold the winter is.&quot;   Petroleum inventories were exceptionally high when theMiddle East crisis began. Supplies of petroleum products wereconsidered in balance; there was a glut of crude in onshorestorage and at sea. As late as Aug. 31, according to theAmerican Petroleum Institute, U.S. crude inventories stillstood at 372.2 million barrels, or 11% higher than theyear-earlier level of 335.8 million.   Oil companies would like to avoid drawing down stocksfurther because of the uncertainties, but won't have muchchoice as demand peaks seasonally in the winter months.   The losses in OPEC's August output weren't fully reflectedin world oil markets last month. That's because tankerscarrying oil from Iraq and Kuwait still were at sea longafter the embargo closed off all exports from thosecountries. Although estimates vary, Iraq's output for lastmonth averaged nearly one million barrels a day. That wasone-third the 3.1 million barrels a day it produced in July.Its September output is estimated at only about 400,000barrels a day, or just enough for domestic use.   The impact now is more evident. According to Roy Mason,publisher of England-based Oil Afloat, there were some 440million barrels of oil in tankers at sea on Aug. 5, threedays after the Mideast crisis began. By Aug. 20, according tohis latest estimate, oil at sea had been drained down to 370million barrels.   &quot;It has taken this long to see the effect of the cutoff&quot;of Iraqi and Kuwaiti oil, said Mr. Mason. As a result, beforevolumes of oil at sea begin rebuilding, &quot;it's almostinevitable that onshore stocks {inventories} will startfalling.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
