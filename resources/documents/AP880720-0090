Zia, the army chief of staff, on May 29 fired his civilian primeminister, Mohammad Khan Junejo, the 33-member Cabinet and the237-member assembly, the lower but more powerful house ofParliament.   The president, speaking before the Senate, also called electionsfor Nov. 16 for legislatures in the provinces of Punjab, Sind,Baluchistan and Northwest Frontier.   The announcement followed seven weeks of intense pressure by allpolitical parties to hold elections and let the nation return to ademocratically elected system.   When he fired the government, Zia accused the officials ofcorruption, incompetence and failure to move quickly on makingIslam the state religion and to prevent a breakdown in law andorder.   Junejo and other politicians denied the charges. Junejo accusedZia of ``arbitrarily dissolving the assembly and disrupting ademocratic system which was operating smoothly.''   Some critics said the Constitution requires elections within 90days of the dissolution of Parliament.   But Zia said an August election was impossible because of areligious holiday among Shiite Moslems, the monsoon season, theabsence of 80,000 to 90,000 pilgrims in Mecca and the need toredraw districts to reflect population shifts.   ``Elections will be free, fair and independent,'' he said. ``Theobjective of the election is to establish and promote cleanpolitics, clean democracy and clean democratic institutions.''   He offered an apology of sorts for his criticism of formerelected officials: ``If anyone has felt hurt by this I express myregrets. My intention was not to hurt anyone, or assassinateanyone's character.''   Some opposition leaders have accused Zia supporters and formerCabinet members with corruption since Zia seized power in a 1977military coup.   Zia overthrew Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, who was hanged in 1979. Hisdaughter, Benazir Bhutto, heads Pakistan's strongest opposition,the Pakistan People`s Party.</TEXT></DOC>
