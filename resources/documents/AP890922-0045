Lastyear, Gilbert was a killer, and over the years Camille and Hazel,Donna and Agnes have been the culprits _ a naming system intended togive each storm a clear identity for the public.   The designations can irritate or please human owners of thenames, depending on the violence of the storm involved.   But the practice at least avoids confusion in issuing warningsabout particular storms, especially when more than one is under way_ such as the current situiation with both Hurricane Hugo andTropical Storm Iris active.   Naming these storms is a practice of long-standing, yet thecurrent system has been common only since World War II, and it wasmodified about a decade ago to include male names.   Using saints names, taken from the day a storm struck, was acommon practice for several hundred years, particularly in regionsthat have a strong Spanish influence.   A storm which struck Puerto Rico on July 26, 1825, for example,became known as the Santa Ana storm.   For meteorologists, a simple system of latitude and longitudecoordinates is used to locate storms. But that can be confusing tothe public, especially when there are two or even three storms atthe same time.   Clement Wragge, an Australian meteorlogist active way back aroundthe turn of the century, may be have helped initiate the currentsystem.   ``Inclement'' Wragge was a well-known lecturer on the weather whobegan naming storms to help explain them to the public. He chose thenames of females for tropical storms, the type we call hurricanes,and he used male names for other types of storms.   Often the male names were those of politicians that Wragge didnot care for, and one of his earliest weather maps includes a stormcalled ``Hackenbush,'' reports Ivan Ray Tannehill in his book, ``TheHurricane Hunters.''   During World War II military meteorologists found themselves busytracking hurricanes, and to avoid confusion named them using thephonetic alphabet _ Able, Baker, Charlie and so on.   Other armed forces weathermen began applying nicknames toparticular storms of all types they were tracking, explained thelate Frank H. Forrester, who was a Marine Corps weatherman in thatera.   Nicknames such as ``Big Jack'' or ``Dopey'' were common, but,``It was strictly informal, believe me,'' said Forrester.   The use of women's names for hurricanes in recent years may stemfrom the book ``Storm,'' by George R. Stewart. Published in 1941, ittells of a weatherman who names storms after women.   As public interest in hurricanes increased in the early 1950s,officials of the Air Force, Navy and Weather Bureau met to try anddevelop a new naming system. This led to a system of female namesstarting in 1953.   The process of selecting the names was eventually shifted to theWorld Meteorological Organization in Geneva, Switzerland, andstarting in 1978 male names were added, alternating with females.   The World Meteorological Organization has lists of names thatrotate over periods of four or five years to keep them fromrepeating too often. In addition, names of exceptionally damagingstorms are retired to prevent historical confusion.   Last year, for example, both Gilbert and Joan were retired. Whentheir turn comes around again they will be replaced by Gordon andJoyce.</TEXT></DOC>
