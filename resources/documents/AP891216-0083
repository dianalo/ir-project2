(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Richard Coddington flips tractors over,rolls them down hills and wrecks them _ but the accidents he causesare all on a computer screen. It's all part of a research projectto make the most deadly workplace, the farm, a little safer.   Coddington and Bob Aherin, agricultural engineers at theUniversity of Illinois, developed the computer simulation so theycould observe factors that lead to accidents on the farm.   Agriculture leads the National Safety Council's list of the mostdeadly occupations. There were about 1,500 farm deaths and 140,000disabling injuries nationwide in 1988, according to theChicago-based organization, which had no individual state figures.   Tractor roll-overs are the leading accidental cause offarm-related deaths in Illinois, accounting for about 30 percent ofthem, according to the Country Companies Insurance Group ofBloomington.   ``The goal is to find out what contributes to an accident andwhat protective devices will help the farmer,'' said Coddington.``I would think manufacturers would find this useful in designingnew equipment.''   The computer allows the researchers to specify things like theweight, wheelbase and center of gravity of the tractor, plus theslope of the hill. They take into consideration factors like wet,slippery fields.   ``I'd like to know if it is going to roll, how long it will takeand the total energy'' unleashed during the rollover, he said.   Coddington punches in some data on his keyboard during a recenttest, and a tractor appears on the screen. Its right wheels slideoff the edge of a hill, its left wheels lift off the ground, thenbounce back down.   ``It tried but it didn't turn over,'' he said. ``It tipped, thenrocked back.''   The information is changed, and again the tractor tips.   ``Now, as it goes past the point of no return, it will rollover,'' said Coddington.   What can make the difference between a tractor that rolls overand one that stays on its wheels? A lower center of gravity andwider wheel spacing can be designed by engineers, but they stressthat the care exhibited by the person behind the wheel is always afactor, too.   ``Manufacturers try to make their equipment safe and postwarnings about hazards,'' said Coddington. ``But people are crazy.They'll use equipment in no way, shape or form the way it wasintended.''   The computer simulation not only may help manufacturers designsafer equipment, but could increase farmers' awareness of dangerousconditions, the researchers say.</TEXT></DOC>
