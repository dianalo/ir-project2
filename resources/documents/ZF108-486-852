(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>The write stuffandM;PC Write is a program with a long history in the world of shareware and it'searned itself a lot of admirers over the years.andP;  That said, the hard fact isthat not all shareware programs, however much they're loved by enthusiasts,are capable of making the move into the commercial market.andP;  Now that theupdated Version 3.03 is available from Sage, PC Write looks likely to makethe grade, with some significant advantages on offer at a budget price.andM;As an editor, PC Write is above average in its price range.andP;  The programprovides a good selection of controls for moving around a file, and soundediting features are supplemented by imaginative touches like the ability toauto-transpose two letters which have been mistyped.andP;  The editor provides alimited WYSIWYG display, except where proportional fonts or certain specialeffects are concerned.andP;  Where text is to be amended, there's the option ofhaving material automatically reformatted as it's entered, without noticeableloss of speed in all but the longest of documents.andM;Those who require the option of foreign character sets will be impressed withthe simple but well-designed facilities for creation of accented characters.andO;The same simplicity is reflected in the facilities for inserting standard IBMgraphic characters.andP;  Probably of more interest to the majority of users isthe competent macro function, although the ability to edit sequences or toprogram in pauses and keyboard input is absent in normal use.andM;Block functions are well thought out, using convenient single key operationto mark the beginning and end of a block.andP;  A windowing capability allows twofiles to be edited in parallel, although the function is a little crude.andP;  Forexample, changing window size is relatively inconvenient and there's nofacility to zoom a window up to full screen size with the other in thebackground.andM;An indication of the care which has gone into the design of simple editingfeatures is the search and replace function, which includes features likeinstant backwards and forwards searches using the grey plus and minus keys,search and replace within a marked block, an un-replace option and theability to swap the search and replace strings so that a whole batch ofreplacements can be reversed.andP;  It's even possible to insert the 'find' stringdirectly into the text -- an extremely useful feature when using the searchfunction to locate index entries and mark them with the relevant dot command.andM;PC Write's formatting capabilities are powerful but not always of a kind thatwould appeal to casual users.andP;  Virtually none of the formatting ismenu-based, relying, rather, on the manual construction of ruler lines andthe insertion of a wide range of dot commands in a document.andP;  Anyone familiarwith this style of formatting will find that the commands are well structuredbut require either an encyclopaedic memory or a copy of the reference manualwithin easy reach of the keyboard.andP;  Present-day users increasingly expect tobe able to set up formats in a more interactive way, so PC Write's adherenceto a style set by older versions of WordStar could be a major disadvantage insome eyes.andM;Having said that, with the exception of winding columns and the ability topreview document appearance on-screen, there are few things lacking in therange of formatting commands.andP;  Ruler lines permit the full range of tabformats, justifications, indents and so forth that would be expected from amore expensive package, plus a few features that many others lack, like theability to set the font for a particular column and to cut and paste within acomplex column structure without difficulty.andM;A respectable range of status information is provided on-screen.andP;  A drawbackfor many users, though, is that the program is unable to make use of thefacilities of a colour system when formatting the screen, while even comparedto other monochrome packages there's sometimes a lack of clarity in screenlayout.andP;  Familiarity with the package would clearly improve the situation,but even so some users may find the menu structure and messages a strain touse intensively.andM;One aspect of PC Write that has a direct bearing on the kind of applicationsfor which it might be suited is the fact that it works entirely in memory,with no facility for disk-based virtual memory.andP;  The consequence of this isthat file size is limited to the amount of free memory -- a considerabledrawback for those using anything less than a full 640Kb system or who havesubstantial resident programs occupying parts of memory.andP;  The situation iscomplicated even more by the fact that subsidiary features of the program --such as the help screens and dictionary -- are also memory-based rather thanbeing read from disk when they are required.andM;On the test system, with 640Kb memory, the maximum file size was around220Kb.andP;  This obviously covers the vast majority of day-to-day applicationsbut could represent a real limitation for some users, bearing in mind thatlarge-scale block operations would reduce the effective size of the file evenfurther.andP;  Having said that, the program deals quite competently with theproblem itself, giving the option of removing the resident dictionary frommemory when space is exhausted.andP;  There's also a facility for breaking down afile which is too large into a sequence of numbered files which the editorwill chain through, both backwards and forwards.andM;On the positive side, PC Write offers some useful extras.andP;  Given thelimitations imposed by storing the dictionary in memory, the spell-checkingfacility is impressive.andP;  User-defined lists (which must also be stored inmemory) can be added in parallel to the main dictionary.andP;  Other featuresinclude the ability to check the whole of a document, the contents of amarked block or a single word, or to have material checked on input --without noticeable loss of speed in normal typing.andP;  A guess facility isincluded to simplify correction.andP;  Another intelligent feature is the abilityto use a custom dictionary as the basis for the creation of an index -- aneminently sensible use of a specialized word list.andP;  Alongside the dictionaryit's also possible to load a 'shorthand' file which allows theauto-completion of standardized abbreviations whenever they're entered.andM;The mail merge function is competent but relatively basic.andP;  Three forms ofASCII data file are recognized: line per field, fixed length field and commadelimited.andP;  Template documents have to include a section describing therecord structure of the file and there are no facilities for automaticselection of items from the data file.andP;  A better feature is the ability toinclude prompts for keyboard input when a blank line is encountered in arecord.andP;  This facility can even be extended to create templates where eachitem to be filled is prompted from the keyboard, providing a useful optionwhere one-off standard letters are sent regularly.andM;Though it would be unrealistic to expect extensive facilities for creatingstructured documents or developing outlines from a package at this end of themarket, PC Write does now have an astute facility for the automatic creationof separate sequences of numbers which can be used for section headings,footnotes and the like.andM;When it comes to housekeeping, a useful range of directory and file-handlingfunctions have been included.andP;  PC Write can perform most everyday chores andits directory screens can include notes and extended information on a file.andO;The main drawback is that notes are not included in a header to the fileitself but in a separate, editable, directory file.andP;  Where files are added ordeleted the program can only note the change and leave users to updatemanually.andM;Lastly, it's worth mentioning that PC Write is designed to be highlyconfigurable.andP;  A series of editable definition files control a huge range ofoptions covering the program's appearance and functions.andP;  Some briefreferences to the possibilities on offer are contained in the users' manualbut anyone wishing to get into this area would require a copy of theadditional technical reference manual.andM;One major improvement over previous versions is that the absolute divisionbetween the editing and printing sections of the program has now beenabolished.andP;  Where it was once necessary to quit the editor and run the printprogram, material can now be printed directly from the editor.andP;  Printfacilities aren't exciting but they do include the ability to print multiplecopies or individual pages -- it's even possible to pause printing for manualinput from the keyboard in the middle of a document (anyone discovering arealistic use for this innovation is to be congratulated).andP;  A reasonablerange of printer drivers is included and support for those included in thelist is fairly comprehensive in terms of fonts and special effects.andP;  If aprinter's specialist functions aren't fully covered, printer definition filesare easily editable for those with the competence and confidence to undertakethe task.andM;Sage's version of PC Write lies comfortably above the mid point of the widerange of capabilities available in relatively inexpensive word processingpackages.andP;  It has less facilities than a comparably priced program such asProtext, for example, but against that most people would find it easier touse; also, the range of capabilities is well chosen, so that most usersprobably won't notice the lack.andP;  The program sometimes has a slightlyrough-and-ready feel which may deter some potential users, and it has somereal limitations when it comes to highly formatted, long or structureddocuments.andP;  Overall, however, for small commercial use PC Write 3.03 appearssolid, productive and, in most respects, commendably easy to get on with.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
