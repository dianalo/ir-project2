Moran,telephone number (202) 732-4242.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>On September 16, 1988, the Secretarypublished a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> (53 FR 36216). The NPRM included a detailed discussionof the various regulatory proposals included in the default reduction initiative,and that discussion will not be repeated here. The comment period on theNPRM was extended through February 28, 1989 (53 FR 39317).The Secretary's extensive review of the default issue and the public commentsreceived since the publication of the NPRM have resulted in a number ofsignificant changes to the NPRM. A discussion of those changes follows.A full discussion of other changes to the NPRM is contained in the Summaryof Comments and Responses, published as an appendix to the regulations.The Secretary believes that several additional regulatory initiatives areneeded to address the default problem. Those new regulatory initiativeswill appear in a new NPRM to be published separately.<ITAG tagnum="84">Revisions to the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="81">Part 668_Student Assistance General Provisions</ITAG>Section 668.15Additional factors for evaluating administrative capabilityThe Secretary has revised the provision in this section that would haveauthorized the initiation of a proceeding to limit, suspend, or terminate(LST) the eligibility of a school with a default rate above 20 percent.The revised provision authorizes the initiation of such a proceeding beginningin 1991 if the school's default rate exceeds 60% (to be lowered to 40%in annual increments of 5%) or if it exceeds 40% and was not reduced byan increment of at least 5% from the preceding year's rate (<T3>e.g., </T3>a 50% rate must be reduced to 45% or below). As noted inrevised andSection; 668.90, a school against whom an LST action is broughtunder this provision will be able to avoid an LST sanction by demonstratingthat it has acted diligently to implement the default reduction measuresdescribed in Appendix D of Part 668. This defense to LST sanctions basedon a high default rate is referred to in this document as ``the AppendixD defense.''It may not be necessary or appropriate to initiate LST actions againstall schools that exceed the default rate triggers described above. Beforedeciding whether to institute an LST action against a school, the Secretarywill generally request from the school the information described in andSection;668.15(b)(2)pertaining to the causes of default by the school's students. In decidingwhether to initiate a proceeding, the Secretary intends to consider thisinformation, the progress being made by the school in reducing defaults,other mitigating factors, and the likelihood of the school's satisfyingthe elements of the Appendix D defense.Under the revised andSection; 668.15(e), a school with a default rate over20% could be required to implement specified reasonable and appropriatedefault reduction measures_in effect, a default management plan. The contentsof each school's plan will be established by the Secretary based on a reviewof the school's analysis of its causes of default, any recommendationsby the cognizant guarantee agencies, consultation with the school, andthe information presented by the school at any informal hearing providedat the school's request. The goal of this process will be to select measuresto address the major causes of default by the school's students.While the authority to require high default schools to implement reasonableand appropriate default reduction measures has been in the General Provisionsregulations since 1975, the use of a cumulative default rate in those regulations,and the inadequacy of available data on defaults that occurred in the earlyyears of the GSL program, has made taking such actions difficult. The useof fiscal year default rates in the final regulations removes this impedimentto the effective use of this authority.In addition to the LST and default management plan initiatives, under revisedandSection;andSection; 682.604 and 682.606, a school with a default rate over30% is required to adopt two ``core'' default reduction measures_a <T3>pro rata </T3>refund policy and delayed certification of loan applications_designedto reduce defaults by dropouts. The Secretary believes that this multi-tieredapproach will preserve access to postsecondary education for all studentsregardless of income level, while protecting the Federal taxpayer fromunreasonable risks of loss. The final regulations recognize that Federalpolicy should not discourage schools from serving the most disadvantagedmembers of society, but that it is nevertheless fair to require schoolsthat present a high default risk to take reasonable measures to reducethat risk.Section 668.22 Distribution formula for institutional refunds and for repaymentof disbursements made to the student for non-institutional costsThe final regulations do not revise current andSection; 668.22, since theproposed revisions to that section in the NPRM were based on the applicationof a <T3>pro rata </T3>refund requirement to all schools. As noted below, thefinal regulations impose that requirement only on schools with defaultrates above 30%.Section 668.44 Institutional informationThe final regulations revise this section to require that a school disclosea job placement rate based on the information it has regarding the jobplacement of its students, including dropouts. The Secretary was concernedthat the NPRM's proposed exclusion from the job placement rate calculationof graduates who do not respond to a school's job placement questionnairecould result in disclosure of inflated job placement rates. This potentialbias is eliminated by the approach taken in the final rule. The schoolis required to disclose to prospective students the number of graduatesfor whom the school lacks job placement information, and the number ofgraduates that decide not to seek employment in the relevant occupation.In this way, the disclosures required by this section will provide datathat is accurate and complete, in a simplified form that facilitates informedconsumer choice. By requiring disclosure of job placement rates for allstudents, not just graduates, the final rule also provides prospectivestudents with more useful information than would disclosures of job placementrates just for graduates.In order to ensure that the job placement information disclosed to prospectivestudents by a school under this section is accurate, each program reviewof the school conducted by the Department will include an examination ofthe procedures employed by the school in compiling that information, and,in selected cases, verification of the accuracy of that information throughinquiries to employers and former students.Section 668.90 Initial and final decisions_AppealsThis section has been revised to reflect the new 60% and 40% default ratethresholds for LST proceedings described in andSection; 668.15 and discussedabove. In addition, the elements of the Appendix D defense that a schoolmay assert to avoid LST sanctions have been added to this section. Thisdefense is satisfied, and the administrative law judge is therefore precludedfrom imposing an LST sanction against the school based on a high defaultrate, if the school shows that it has acted diligently to implement thedefault reduction measures described in Appendix D to Part 668.It should be emphasized that the Appendix D defense prevents the terminationof a school based on its default rate if the school shows that it has implementedthe measures listed in Appendix D. Thus, while a school's default rateof more than 60%, or of more than 40% absent a 5% annual reduction, isgrounds for initiating an LST proceeding, it cannot serve as the basisfor imposing an LST sanction on a school that demonstrates its administrativecapability under this defense. The Secretary notes, however, that absentthis defense, the ALJ must impose the sanction sought by the designatedDepartment official; the ALJ retains no discretion in such a case. In effect,the LST provisions of andSection; 668.15 and the Appendix D defense operateto (1) require that each school with a default rate above the rates describedabove implement the measures listed in Appendix D, and (2) make LST sanctionsapply automatically to a school that fails to make a diligent effort todo so. The Secretary believes that, although some of the measures in AppendixD will be more effective for some schools than for others, the seriousrisk of financial loss to the GSL and SLS programs posed by schools withvery high default rates requires that those schools take each of thesesteps, in order to provide the substantial incremental benefit in defaultreduction that each step will afford at every school.The Secretary further notes that the Appendix D defense does not preventthe imposition of an LST sanction against a school based on a violationof program requirements. The Secretary will view a school's substantialnoncompliance with a requirement of the regulations contained in this documentas a serious infraction, requiring imposition of the termination sanctionin most cases.<ITAG tagnum="81">Part 682_Guaranteed Student Loan and Plus Programs</ITAG>Section 682.410Fiscal, administrative, and enforcement requirementsThe final regulations revise the NPRM by increasing from 15% to 20% theschool default rate that will trigger a guarantee agency's duty to conducta program review of a school. A review is not required of a school witha rate above 20% if the school is subject to a default management planimposed by the Secretary under andSection;668.15, or if the school's rateis not based on at least one cohort of loans entering repayment in a singlefiscal year that totals $100,000 or more. These revisions greatly reducethe burden on guarantee agencies with respect to the number of reviewsrequired to be conducted, while preserving the effectiveness of the programreview requirement as an element of the default reduction initiative.Section 682.603 Certification by a participating school in connection witha loan applicationUnder the NPRM, one default reduction measure that a school with a defaultrate above 20% would have had to justify not implementing was delayingthe certification of a borrower's loan application so that the borrower'sloan proceeds were not received by the borrower until at least 30 daysinto the loan period. <T3>See </T3>NPRM proposed andSection;668.90(a)(3)(iii)(B) and proposed AppendixD to Part 668, item 14. Section 682.603 of the final regulations makesdelayed certification with respect to the school's first-time borrowersa requirement applicable to any school with a default rate over 30%, untilthe Secretary notifies the school that its rate no longer exceeds thatlevel. To ensure that this provision operates to prevent the delivery ofloan proceeds to early dropouts as intended, this section also specifiesthat the student's endorsement of the check for the first disbursementof a loan subject to delayed certification may not occur until 30 daysinto the loan period.The Secretary believes that delayed delivery of loan proceeds to first-timeborrowers should apply to all schools, and has proposed legislation toaccomplish this goal. These regulations only effect this policy for highdefault schools, because the Secretary believes that the impact on theprograms of applying this policy to all schools is serious enough thatthe Congress should be given the opportunity to decide whether such a stepis warranted.Section 682.606 Refund policy This provision has been revised to require the implementation of a <T3>pro rata </T3>refund policy only by schools with default rates above30%, and to limit the required application of such a policy by the schoolto the shorter of the first six months in the student's program of study,or the first half of that program. All other schools and academic periodscontinue to be subject to the fair and equitable refund requirements ofandSection;682.606(b), and Appendix A to Part 682. As with the delayed certificationrequirement, this rule would require high default schools to take a stepthat addresses the troubling problem of defaults by early dropouts. TheSecretary is limiting the application of this rule to high default schoolsbecause he believes that the regulatory imposition of a mandated refundpolicy should only be undertaken for schools whose default experience providesstrong justification for doing so on program integrity grounds. The Secretarybelieves that the importance of a <T3>pro rata </T3>refund policy in reducing early dropouts provides thatjustification when a school's default rate exceeds 30%.Section 682.610 Records, reports, and inspection requirements for participatingschoolsThe final regulations revise this section to require each school that isrequired to use a ``track record'' disclosure form set forth in AppendixA to Part 668 to provide a completed form to the Secretary, along withinformation on the total cost of the program involved, on an annual basis.The NPRM required that the completed form be provided to each prospectivestudent, but did not mandate that the school provide a copy of the formto the Secretary.The Secretary will use the track record information provided under thisprovision in making various policy decisions relevant to vocational trainingprograms, and in formulating his proposals for reauthorization of the HigherEducation Act in 1991. The Secretary also intends to use this track recordinformation to compile and disseminate lists of undergraduate nonbaccalaureatevocational training programs, arranged by geographic area and vocationin which each program is offered, to further enhance consumers' abilityto make well-informed choices about enrollment in vocational training programs.The recipients of the lists will include high schools, welfare offices,and other entities likely to receive requests for information on theseprograms from prospective students. <ITAG tagnum="84">Analysis of Comments and Changes </ITAG>In response to the Secretary's invitation in the NPRM, 2,452 parties submittedcomments on the proposed regulations. In addition, the Secretary receivedover 1,200 comments in response to the separate request for comments onthe default issue published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on November 3, 1988 (53 FR 44514). An analysisof the comments and of the changes in the regulations since publicationof the NPRM is published as an appendix to these final regulations. Substantiveissues raised by commenters are discussed under the section of the regulationsto which they pertain. Technical and other minor comments and changes arenot addressed. <ITAG tagnum="84">Executive Order 12291 </ITAG>The regulations have been reviewed in accordance with Executive Order 12291.They are not classified as major because they do not meet the criteriafor major regulations established in the order.<ITAG tagnum="84">Assessment of Educational Impact </ITAG>In the notice of proposed rulemaking, the Secretary requested commentson whether the proposed regulations would require transmission of informationthat is being gathered by or is available from any other agency or authorityof the United States.

If the school notifiedthe student in writing prior to enrollment that return of the specificequipment involved would be required if the student withdrew, the schoolmay deduct from the refund owed under this section the documented costto the school of that equipment if the student fails to return it within10 days of the date of the student's receipt of the request from the school.However, the school may not delay its payment of a refund to a lender underandSection; 682.607 by reason of this process. <ITAG tagnum="20">(Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1078, 1078-1, 1078-2, 1082, 1094) </ITAG>17.

Manycommenters objected to use of this criterion to eliminate a school fromparticipation in all Federal student financial aid programs. They believedthat this factor alone was not an adequate indicator of a school's administrativecapability. Many commenters also believed that a school should have theoption of implementing a default reduction plan to reduce its default rateprior to action by the Secretary to terminate the school.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Discussion: </T3>Several changes have been made. The Secretary hasrevised this section to implement a multi-tiered approach that authorizesthe initiation of an LST action beginning in 1991 if the school's defaultrate exceeds 60% (this standard to be lowered to 40% in increments of 5%by 1995), or if that rate exceeds 40% and has not been reduced by an incrementof at least 5% from the preceding year's rate. Under andSection;andSection;682.604 and 682.606, schools with default rates over 30% would be subjectto two mandatory default reduction measures_a <T3>pro rata </T3>refund policy and delayed certification of loan applicationsfor first-time borrowers. Finally, under this section, schools with defaultrates over 20% would be required to implement default management plansestablished by the Secretary on a case-by-case basis, with components ofthe plan being drawn from Appendix D, recommendations of the school andguarantee agencies, and other sources. The school would be provided anopportunity for an informal hearing prior to imposition of a plan.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Comments: </T3>Several commenters disagreed with the use of a fiscalyear default rate. They thought that a cumulative rate or a rate that reflecteda longer time frame would be more equitable. Other commenters urged theuse of a dollar-based rate, rather than a borrower-based rate, and a numberof commenters urged that the rate take account of post-default collections.Some commenters also expressed concern about the quality of available dataon defaults.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Discussion: </T3>No change has been made. The Secretary believes thatusing a fiscal year default rate is more equitable than using a cumulativerate because it does not penalize a school for a high default rate incurredbefore it took steps to reduce defaults. Indeed, the positive results ofactions taken by a school to reduce its default rate would be readily evidentfrom its fiscal year rates, but not from its cumulative rate. Further,a default that takes place more than two years after the borrower leavesschool is unlikely to be attributable to the actions of the school andshould therefore not be charged to the school.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">A borrower-based rate has been retained in preference to a dollar-basedrate to avoid numerous technical issues inherent in the latter approach,such as the calculation of outstanding balances, attribution of payments,capitalization of interest, and the like. A dollar-based rate would alsotend to unfairly and artificially reduce the rates for longer programs,since graduates of those programs have loan balances that are much larger,relative to the loan balances of default-prone dropouts, than the graduatesof shorter programs. Recognizing past problems with the quality of default-relateddata submitted to the Department by guarantee agencies, the Secretary hasrecently revised the reporting requirements for guarantee agencies to ensurethat the data collected from all guarantee agencies on which actions wouldbe taken under these regulations is both accurate and complete.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Comments: </T3>One commenter asked how deferments are treated in thedefault rate calculation.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Discussion: </T3>No change has been made. It is the entry of a loaninto repayment that is relevant to the default rate calculation. Subsequentdeferments are considered as falling within the repayment period. The endof a deferment period does not result in the borrower ``entering repayment,''even though the duty to make payments resumes at that time, since the borroweris considered to have been in repayment throughout the deferment period.Thus, a deferment granted a borrower after entering repayment on a loanin a given fiscal year is ignored in calculating the school's rate forthat fiscal year. This is necessary both because not all deferments appearon the ``tape dump'' (the current source of the Secretary's default information)and because a default by a borrower after leaving deferment status maybe too removed in time from the borrower's attendance at the school tobe fairly charged to the school.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Comments: </T3>Many commenters claimed that it is unfair to place theburden of proof on the school to justify a high default rate. One commenterrepresenting numerous lenders supported placing the burden of proof onthe school, but recommended that a 50% default rate be used to triggerthis rather than the 20% rate proposed in the NPRM. Many commenters objectedto excluding the composition of the student body as an acceptable explanationfor a high default rate. Other commenters wanted schools to have the optionto deny certification of a loan, as well as require cosigners or creditchecks for borrowers, to enable them to refuse loans to likely defaulters.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Discussion: </T3>A change has been made. Section 668.90 has been revisedto clarify the defense that may be used to avoid LST sanctions. The Secretarybelieves that the burden of proof is appropriately placed on the schoolto demonstrate its administrative capability when a high default rate givesrise to a strong inference that this capability is lacking. At the highdefault rates specified in the final rule, this inference clearly arises.The recommendation that schools be allowed to require cosigners or creditchecks, and to refuse to certify applications for otherwise eligible Staffordand SLS borrowers, would require legislative changes to implement, andthus are beyond the scope of these regulations.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Comments: </T3>Several commenters were disturbed by the possibilitythat schools with very few borrowers would be subject to sanctions basedon their default rates.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Discussion: </T3>A change has been made. The Secretary recognizes thatschools with very few borrowers could be placed at a disadvantage if theyare judged under the default rate formula outlined in the NPRM, so he hasrevised that provision to evaluate a school with 30 borrowers or less enteringrepayment in a fiscal year based on a ``rolling'' three-year average defaultrate. In addition, it should be noted that an LST action allowed by thisregulation against high default rate schools is not mandatory, and couldbe declined if a school's default volume is so low that the Department'sresources would be more effectively employed in other ways.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Comments: </T3>A number of commenters recommended that the defaultrate calculation not treat as defaults, loans on which the borrowers beginor resume repayment after default.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Discussion: </T3>No change has been made. The fiscal year default rateis designed to yield information as to a school's performance in default-relatedmatters. The use of post-default collection information would reduce theusefulness of the rate for this purpose by introducing factors unrelatedto a school's default-related performance, such as the guarantor's effectivenessin collecting defaulted loans.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Comments: </T3>Several commenters asked whether a school would be given``credit'' for defaulted loans that are purchased by that institution.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Discussion: </T3>A change has been made. The Secretary believes thata payment made by a school or related party to avoid a default is not anappropriate basis for excluding a loan from a school's default rate, andhas revised this section to reflect that position.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73"/><T3>Section 668.22 Distribution formula for institutional refunds and forrepayment of disbursements made to the student for non-institutional costs</T3><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Comments: </T3>A number of commenters suggested that it would be inappropriateand unfair to establish, under proposed andSection; 668.22(a)(3) (i) and(ii), two distinct refund attribution formulas_one for GSL, SLS, and PLUSloan recipients, and one for other students.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Discussion: </T3>A change has been made. Since the proposed revisionsto andSection; 668.22 were based on the application of a <T3>pro rata </T3>requirement to <T3>all </T3>schools, these regulations do not revise current andSection;668.22. Pursuant to andSection; 682.606(b)(2) of these final regulations,a school is required to adopt a <T3>pro rata </T3>refund policy as one of two ``core'' default reductionmeasures only if its default rate exceeds 30%, and then only for certainborrowers and academic periods.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">Section 668.44 Institutional information</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Comments:</T3> A number of commenters suggested that the disclosuresrequired by andSection; 668.44 (c) through (f) of the NPRM should be reservedfor institutions having ``unacceptable'' default rates. Many commentersagreed that the disclosures are needed, but suggested that they apply toall programs and all schools. Several commenters supported the Secretary'sproposal to target these disclosures to vocational training programs, particularlygiven the aggressive marketing techniques employed by many trade and technicalschools.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Discussion:</T3> No change has been made. While the provisions of currentandSection; 668.44 (a) and (b) are applicable to all schools, the Secretarybelieves that the dropout rate, placement rate, and State licensing examinationpass rate disclosures, specified in andSection; 668.44 (c) through (f), shouldbe mandated only for a school that offers either an undergraduate non-baccalaureatetrade program or another program (whether or not undergraduate non-baccalaureate)for which it makes a claim regarding job placement in order to attractprospective students. As stated in the preamble to the NPRM, the Secretarybelieves that adequate and accurate information on these matters is ofcritical importance to prospective students evaluating the quality of suchprograms. It should be noted that the provisions of andSection; 668.44 (c)through (f) would not apply to a program that is primarily intended aspreparatory for, and acceptable towards, a baccalaureate or equivalentlevel degree (<T3>e.g.</T3>, Associate of Arts degree programs offered by community colleges),as distinguished from a course of study designed to provide a completevocational training program.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Comments:</T3> Many commenters expressed concerns about the administrativeburden imposed by the information collection and disclosure activitiesrequired by andSection; 668.44 (c) through (e), and by the requirement thata school utilize and maintain the forms required by andSection; 668.44(f)and Appendix A to Part 668. As a result a number of commenters recommendedthat the disclosures specified in the NPRM only be required of schoolshaving unacceptable default rates.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Discussion:</T3> No change has been made. By statute, a school mustdisclose dropout rate, placement rate, and State licensing examinationrate information for any programs as to which the school makes a marketingclaim regarding job placement. <T3>See</T3> section 487(a)(8) of the HEA. This requirement applies tohigh default and low default schools alike. Given the fact that undergraduatenonbaccalaureate vocational training programs are marketed and purchasedalmost exclusively for their value in imparting employable vocational skills,the intent of section 487(b)(8) can be achieved only if the informationlisted in andSection; 668.44 (c) through (f) is disclosed for each programof that type. Moreover, it is apparent that the market forces that shouldoperate to reward effective programs and weed out the ineffective onesare not currently working. The Secretary believes that more informed consumerchoice will do much to correct that problem, and thereby substantiallyreduce defaults, but this can only be accomplished if consumers have accessto the information required under these provisions for all programs ofthis nature, good and bad. The Secretary, in andSection; 668.44(f), has alsospecified that the required information described in andSection; 668.44(c)(2) through (4) be disclosed to prospective students using the ``trackrecord'' disclosure forms contained in Appendix A. The Secretary believesthat the use of a standardized form, in an easy-to-read format and in languagethat can be readily understood by all students, will greatly enhance aprospective student's ability to fully consider the information provided,and to compare the various programs in which he or she may be interested.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Comments:</T3> One commenter indicated that a variety of factors couldaffect the decision of a graduate not to seek employment in the occupationfor which the training was offered by the school. The commenter arguedthat the job placement rate calculation specified in andSection; 668.44(c)(3)should exclude these graduates.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Discussion:</T3> A change has been made. The Secretary agrees thatthere may be valid reasons why a graduate of a program does not seek employmentin the occupation for which the training was offered. Section 668.44(c)(3)of these final regulations has been revised to allow a school to note inits disclosure the number of graduates who state in writing that they havechosen not to seek employent in the occupation for which they were trained.However, this provision does not allow the school to include a graduatewho discontinues seeking such employment after an unsuccessful search.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Comments:</T3> One commenter recommended that the ``completion rate''calculation in andSection; 668.44(c)(4) include as completions borrowerswho leave school to accept employment in the occupation for which the trainingwas offered.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Discussion:</T3> A change has been made. Section 668.44(c)(4) has beenrevised to include as completions in the completion rate calculation thosestudents who have not successfully completed the program (<T3>i.e.</T3>, graduated), but who have obtained full-time employment inthe occupation for which the training was offered within 150% of the normaltime for completion of the program.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Comments:</T3> One commenter suggested that, in using the documentsspecified in Appendix A to Part 668, as required by andSection; 668.44(f),accommodation should be made for institutions that serve largely Spanish-speakingpopulations.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Discussion:</T3> A change has been made. Section 668.44(f) has beenrevised to permit the use of a foreign language version of the forms forstudents whose primary language is not English.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Comments:</T3> One commenter recommended that the Secretary, as partof these default reduction measures, require lenders to disclose to borrowersinformation about the role that secondary markets play in the GSL, SLS,and PLUS programs. The commenter also suggested that lenders be requiredto give notice to the guarantor, the school, and the student whenever aloan is sold or transferred to another eligible lender.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Discussion:</T3> No change has been made. While the Secretary agreeswith the concerns expressed by the commenter, the suggestions are not withinthe scope of the final regulations. A separate NPRM, in which these issueswill be addressed, is currently under development.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">Section 668.90 Initial and final decisions_appeals</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Comments:</T3> The comments received for this section mirrored thecomments made under andSection; 668.15. The major issues addressed by commenterswere the use of a 20% default rate as a trigger to limit, suspend, or terminatean institution from participation in all Title IV programs, the use ofa fiscal year default rate, and the relevance of the composition of a school'sstudent body.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Discussion:</T3> A change has been made. These issues have been addressedin the preamble and elsewhere in this Appendix. This section has been revisedto include the elements of the Appendix D defense that a school may proveto avoid LST sanctions. This defense prevents termination of a school ifthe school shows that it has acted diligently to implement the defaultreduction measures described in Appendix D of Part 668.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="74">Appendix D_Default Reduction Measures</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Comments: </T3>The Secretary received broad support for the idea thata school with a high default rate should adopt default reduction measuressuch as those contained in Appendix D. A number of school commenters notedthat many of these measures were already part of the standard procedures.Many commenters were concerned about the administrative burden that wouldbe imposed on a school performing some of these measures.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Discussion: </T3>A change has been made. To assist schools in identifyingthose measures appropriate for their circumstances, the Secretary has groupedthe measures according to the cause of default that each is meant to address.Any school with a default rate over 20% could be required to implementa default management plan containing some of the measures in Appendix D,as well as other appropriate default reduction steps. These steps wouldalso be selected to address the school's circumstances. In this manner,the Secretary and the school will be able to select those measures thatrequire only the administrative effort necessary to adequately and efficientlyaddress the school's particular causes of default.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Comments: </T3>One commenter was concerned that a school might be prohibitedby State law from withholding an academic transcript of a former student.Another commenter argued that withholding a transcript would be counterproductivebecause, in the case of a student seeking employment, denying a requestfrom a prospective employer for an academic transcript would prevent theborrower from acquiring a job, perhaps preventing the borrower from repayingthe loan.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Discussion: </T3>A change has been made. The Secretary concurs withthe objections raised and has deleted this measure from the final regulation.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Comments: </T3>Several commenters expressed concern over the suggestionin Appendix D that schools revise admission policies, as these policies,in the case of community colleges, are sometimes mandated by the State.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Discussion: </T3>A change has been made. The final regulation specifiesthat the school should revise its admissions policies in a manner thatis consistent with applicable State law.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Comments: </T3>Many commenters requested clarifications about the applicabilityof the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA) to a school that followedthe recommendation that it contact a borrower during his or her grace periodor after the school received a copy of the lender's preclaims assistancerequest to urge the borrower to repay the loan.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Discussion: </T3>No change has been made. This provision specifiesthat the school's actions must be consistent with the FDCPA. The authorityto interpret the FDCPA rests with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), notwith the Department of Education. In a letter from FTC's Division of CreditPractices to Louise G. Trubek, Executive Director, Center for Public Representation,dated September 12, 1988, the FTC indicated that pre-default collectionefforts are not covered by the FDCPA.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Comments: </T3>Some commenters argued that, without notification tothe school from the lender or guarantee agency that a borrower has madepayments to resolve a delinquency, the school might continue efforts tourge the borrower to make payments after the delinquency is resolved, therebydamaging the collectibility of the loan. Other commenters expressed a moregeneral concern that poorly informed or timed collection efforts by schoolswould do more harm than good.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Discussion: </T3>No change has been made. As noted in the NPRM, thisdefault reduction step should be taken in cooperation with the lender toavoid confusing the borrower or damaging the collectibility of the loan.A school should always note in its communications with the borrower that,if the borrower has made payments to cure a delinquency, the school's noticeshould be ignored.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Comments: </T3>Several commenters supported the proposal that, underandSection; 668.90, a school with a default rate over 20%, to avoid an LSTsanction, would have to justify not adopting the practice of delaying thecertification of a borrower loan application so that the borrower's proceedswere not delivered to the borrower or credited to the borrower's accountuntil the borrower had attended the institution for 30-45 days during theperiod for which the loan was made. One commenter suggested applying thisas a requirement for high default schools with dropout or cancellationproblems. Numerous other commenters objected to this measure, expressingconcern that it would negatively affect borrowers who need the proceedsfrom the loan for living expenses, and would create cash-flow problemsat some schools.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Discussion: </T3>A change has been made. Section 682.603(c) has beenamended to require each school with a default rate over 30% to delay certificationof the loan application of each student for his or her first GSL or SLSloan for attendance at the school. The Secretary believes that the potentialbenefit of this measure justifies requiring all schools with default ratesover 30% to take this step.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">Section 682.410 Fiscal, administrative, and enforcement requirements</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Comments: </T3>Several commenters supported the Secretary's proposalto establish a default rate that would trigger a guarantee agency's reviewof a school. However, many commenters suggested that the 15% default ratetrigger was too low and should be increased to reduce the burden imposedon schools and agencies by this requirement.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Discussion:</T3> A change has been made. The Secretary has revisedthe NPRM by increasing from 15% to 20% the default rate that triggers aguarantee agency program review of a school. The final rule also excludesfrom mandatory review any school that is subject to a default managementplan imposed by the Secretary under 34 CFR 668.15, and any school whosedefault rate of over 20 percent is not based on at least one cohort ofloans entering repayment in a single fiscal year that totals $100,000 ormore. These revisions significantly reduce the number of program reviewsthat an agency would have been required to perform under the NPRM whilepreserving the effectiveness of this requirement as a default reductiontool.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The Secretary notes that, as guarantee agencies have previously beeninformed, the Department is receptive to proposals from individual guaranteeagencies to employ specific selection criteria for program reviews thatdiffer from the ``top ten/2%'' program review criteria in current andSection;682.410(c)(1)(ii) (A) and (B). If the Secretary is satisfied that an agency'sproposed criteria represent an effective approach to the selection of schoolsfor reviews, he will grant that agency a waiver from those provisions.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Comments: </T3>Several commenters questioned the guarantee agencies'expertise to conduct program reviews of schools. Some commenters suggestedthat the reviews should be performed by professionally-trained auditorsthrough program reviews by the Secretary or independent auditors hiredby schools to review other Federal programs.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Discussion: </T3>No change has been made. Although the Secretary intendsto increase Federal lender and school reviews, it is the Secretary's intentthat guarantee agencies can and should assume a major responsibility formonitoring their program participants. The Secretary has provided guaranteeagencies with extensive training in program review requirements and hasdeveloped a comprehensive site review guide for agency use.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Comments</T3>: One commenter recommended that the Secretary includea provision that would exempt from guarantee agency review any school thathad lowered its default rate to below 15% even if its default rate exceeded15% in the immediately preceding year.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Discussion</T3>: No change has been made. The Secretary believes thatthe increase from 15% to 20% in the default rate that triggers a guaranteeagency review adequately addresses this concern.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Comments</T3>: Two commenters supported the requirement of guaranteeagency program reviews of schools with excessive default rates, but thoughtthat the review should be limited to the GSL, SLS, and PLUS programs, andshould not include other Title IV programs.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Discussion</T3>: No change has been made. The provision requiring guaranteeagency reviews of schools with fiscal year default rates in excess of 20%applies only to the GSL, PLUS, and SLS programs.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Comments</T3>: Several commenters questioned which agency would conductthe compliance program review for schools that deal with several guaranteeagencies.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Discussion</T3>: No change has been made. An agency may either conducta joint review of a school with another agency or establish a reciprocalagreement with the other agency. Under a joint review or a reciprocal agreement,each participating agency is responsible for the quality of the review.The Secretary recommends that all reciprocal agreements state that theperforming agency will conduct the review in accordance with the OSFA sitereview guides, and that, as required, any unique requirements of each agencywhose review response is to be satisfied by a review under the agreementwill be included in each such review.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">Section 682.411 Due diligence by lenders in the collection of guaranteeagency loans</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Comments</T3>: Some commenters recommended that, rather than requiringthe lender to provide a copy of each preclaim assistance request to theschool for attendance at which the loan was made, the lender should beallowed to provide this information to the last school attended by theborrower. The commenters noted that the last school attended by the borrowercould provide more recent information to assist the lender in its collectionefforts.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Discussion</T3>: No change has been made. The requirement that a lenderprovide a school with a copy of the preclaim assistance request is designedto alert the school of a potential default by one of its students, andto allow the school an opportunity to act in a timely manner to avert adefault. Fairness requires that the school against whom a default willbe charged have the opportunity to make a diligent effort to contact theborrower to encourage repayment.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Comments</T3>: Some commenters suggested that lenders be allowed toprovide a periodic list to the school of delinquent borrowers for whichthe lender has requested preclaim assistance from the guarantor. Othercommenters suggested that the guarantors, rather than lenders, providethis information to schools.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Discussion</T3>: A change has been made. The final regulations requirethe lender to notify the school within 30 days after it requests preclaimassistance. In this way, the regulations allow time for guarantors wishingto do so to provide schools with this notice on lenders' behalf, throughthe use of periodic lists. However, the Secretary believes that promptnotice to the school is necessary for any actions taken by the school tobe meaningful in averting defaults, and is therefore requiring that noticereach the school within 30 days of the date of the lender's preclaim assistancerequest.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">Section 682.604 Processing the borrower loan proceeds and counselingborrowers</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Comments</T3>: Many commenters proposed that the lender, not the school,be responsible for counseling the student prior to the disbursement ofthe loan proceeds to the institution.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Discussion</T3>: No change has been made. The Secretary has declinedto impose the responsibility of in-person counseling on the lender becausethe distance between many lenders and the borrowers they serve is oftengreat. The Secretary believes that since a school will typically be ina better position than the lender to engage in face-to-face counseling,it is the most appropriate entity to provide entrance counseling. Moreover,lenders are already required to provide detailed disclosures to borrowersat the time of loan disbursement regarding the borrower's rights and obligationson GSL and SLS loans.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Comments</T3>: Several commenters indicated that they believe entrancecounseling is redundant and ultimately ineffective because, in their view,early counseling does not make an impression on the student and does notsignificantly reduce defaults. Many other commenters supported the requirementof entrance counseling as an effective default reduction measure.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Discussion</T3>: No change has been made. The Secretary believes, andthe experience of many schools confirms, that improving a borrower's understandingof the terms and conditions of the loan and impressing upon the borrowerthe importance of meeting his or her repayment obligations, at the timeof receipt of loan proceeds, helps greatly in reducing defaults.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Comments</T3>: Several commenters suggested that the school be giventhe flexibility to schedule entrance counseling throughout the semester,or at least prior to the student's second loan disbursement, to avoid schedulingall counseling sessions with loan recipients during the registration period,when a substantial burden is already being imposed on the school's administrativeresources.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Discussion: </T3>No change has been made. The Secretary believes itis imperative for students to receive loan counseling at, or prior to,the receipt of a GSL or SLS loan. The linkage of this counseling with thereceipt of loan funds will impress upon the borrower the importance ofthe obligation to repay the money he or she is about to receive, therebylessening the risk of default.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Comments: </T3>Several commenters recommended that schools be allowedto use videotape presentations to counsel their students. Some commenterssuggested that a videotape presentation followed up by a question and answerperiod with a financial aid officer would be an effective and efficientway to counsel borrowers.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Discussion: </T3>A change has been made. The Secretary agrees withthis recommendation and has revised the NPRM to allow for videotape presentations,and to require that the school provide each borrower an opportunity, afterthe entrance counseling session, to obtain answers to questions he or shemay have regarding the loan.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Comments: </T3>Many commenters believed that requiring entrance counselingis too burdensome and costly for a school with a small financial aid staffand a large number of loan recipients. Other commenters expressed concernabout the difficulty centralized financial aid offices would have in meetingwith loan recipients at remote branches of the school, and suggested thatthe school be paid an administrative allowance to cover the extra burden.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Discussion: </T3>No change has been made. The Secretary believes thatan institutional financial aid office can inexpensively reach its loanrecipients through the use of group counseling sessions or videotapes.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Comments: </T3>One commenter recommended that the requirement in theNPRM that students in undergraduate non-baccalaureate vocational trainingprograms be advised that they are obligated to repay their loans regardlessof the outcome of their enrollment in the program, should be expanded toapply to all programs of study.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Discussion: </T3>A change has been made. The Secretary agrees withthis recommendation and has revised the regulations to make this requirementapplicable to all programs of study.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">Section 682.605 Determining the date of a student's withdrawal</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Comments: </T3>Several commenters indicated that the proposed changeto andSection; 682.605(a) requires clarification.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Discussion: </T3>No change has been made. The amendment to andSection;682.605(a) simply clarifies that the date of a student's withdrawal, calculatedunder andSection; 682.605(b), only relates to the institution's reports tolenders and to the date on which the institution's duty to pay a refundarises, not to the withdrawal date used for refund calculations. For thislatter purpose, andSection; 682.604 uses the student's last recorded dayof attendance as 34 CFR 668.22 has done since January, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">Section 682.606 School refund policy</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Comments: </T3>Many commenters objected to the proposed amendment toandSection; 682.606 requiring a school to employ a <T3>pro rata </T3>refund policy for a student receiving or benefiting froma GSL, SLS, or PLUS program loan who withdraws prior to the completionof the academic period for which the loan is made. These commenters believethat this requirement represented an unwarranted Federal intrusion intoa school's administrative practices and would impose a significant increasein the administrative burden involved in refund calculations. Numerouscommenters also argued that a <T3>pro rata </T3>refund was unfair in light of the substantial ``up front''costs incurred by schools in enrolling a student and in offering a programthat does not appreciably change when a student withdraws from school.A number of commenters argued that their current institutional refund policies,developed using standards approved by their accrediting agencies, are fairand equitable and do not unfairly penalize dropouts or contribute to loandefaults. Many commenters noted that the loss of revenue to the schoolthat would result from the increased volume and dollar amount of refundscalculated using a <T3>pro rata </T3>policy would inevitably be passed along to students inthe form of increased tuition costs. Several commenters suggested thatthe availability of a <T3>pro rata </T3>refund would encourage a student to withdraw when heor she encounters academic or financial difficulties. Several commentersrecommended restricting the use of a <T3>pro rata </T3>policy to high default schools since the Secretary, inannouncing the proposed rules, noted the linkage between a high level ofdropouts and defaults. Some commenters recommended that the Departmentshould not regulate the refund policy applicable to students who completeat least one half of their programs to reduce the administrative burdenon schools and the intrusiveness of the rule, and in recognition both ofthe ``up front'' costs argument and the inapplicability of the ``drop outreduction'' rationale to a student that completes a substantial portionof the program before dropping out.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Discussion: </T3>A change has been made. Although the widely used practiceof over-enrollment and the ability of many schools to quickly replace adropout with a new enrollee militate strongly against the ``up front costs''argument, the Secretary is requiring the use of a <T3>pro rata </T3>refund policy only when the default experience of theschool requires that step to maintain GSL, SLS, and PLUS program integrity.Accordingly, this provision has been revised to require the implementationof a <T3>pro rata </T3>refund policy only by schools with default rates above30 percent. Any school with a default rate at or below 30% must continueto use fair and equitable refund policies as defined in existing regulations.Further, the Secretary believes that the prospects for default are greateramong those students who withdraw early in their programs, and that theaim of this rule should therefore be to remove the incentive for a schoolto enroll a student lacking a reasonable prospect for completing his orher program of study. The Secretary has accordingly revised the proposedrule to require the use of a <T3>pro rata </T3> policy only for a student whose withdrawal date occursprior to the halfway point of the student's program, or the end of thefirst six months of the student's program, whichever is earlier. The Secretarybelieves that this targeted application of the <T3>pro rata </T3> refund rule will achieve the goals of the rule witha minimum of adverse effects. Also, the Secretary has revised the ruleto permit the school to round upward to the nearest 10 percent the portionof the program deemed to have been completed by a student, to reduce administrativeburden.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Comments: </T3>Several commenters from public institutions indicatedthat State law prevents them from applying a <T3>pro rata </T3>refund policy.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Discussion: </T3>No change has been made. The Secretary considers theuse of a <T3>pro rata </T3> refund policy by those schools with default rates above30 percent to be a necessary and appropriate administrative requirementfor participation in the GSL, SLS, and PLUS programs. Therefore, schoolsthat are subject to this requirement are required to implement a <T3>pro rata </T3>refund policy if they wish to continue to participatein those programs, regardless of the requirements of State law.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Comments: </T3>Many commenters objected to the imposition of a <T3>pro rata </T3>refund policy on the grounds that it would create inequitiesbetween loan recipients and students who do not receive loans or who donot receive any Title IV aid. Some commenters felt that the proposed regulationswould force schools to establish multiple refund policies. Others consideredthat they would, as a matter of equity, be forced to apply a <T3>pro rata </T3>refund policy to all students. A number of commentersasserted that any refund policy mandated by the Secretary should encompassall students at an institution.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Discussion: </T3>No change has been made. The Secretary's legal authorityto mandate refund policies at school is limited to students benefitingfrom GSL, SLS, or PLUS loans.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Comments: </T3>Some commenters argued that the implementation of a<T3>pro rata </T3>refund policy would have little impact on the defaultrate at a school, particularly if the school continues to be permittedto apply refund amounts to other sources of aid before returning loan fundsto lenders. Other commenters indicated that, since students often use loanfunds for non-institutional costs, a <T3>pro rata </T3>refund policy affecting only direct institutional costs,may result minimal increases in refunds for many students.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Discussion: </T3>No change has been made. These final regulations requirehigh default schools to take steps, such as the implementation of a <T3>pro rata </T3>refund policy, to address the problem of defaults bydropouts. The primary purpose of the <T3>pro rata </T3>refund requirement is not to increase the dollar amountof loan funds returned to the lender, but to remove the incentive for highdefault schools to enroll students who are inadequately prepared and aretherefore likely to quickly drop out and default. This rule also will providean incentive for schools to take steps on their own to improve their completionrates.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Comments: </T3>A number of commenters suggested various measures toeither complement or replace the implementation of the <T3>pro rata </T3>refund policy. Some commenters suggested that loans shouldbe awarded incrementally as the student progresses through the academicterm or that the aid be awarded after the student has successfully completedthe term. Others felt that lenders should be required to disburse PartB loans according to dates recommended by the school. Still other commenterssuggested requiring credit-worthy endorsers as a way to reduce defaults.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Discussion: </T3>No changes have been made. Implementation of thesesuggestions would require statutory amendments and therefore does not fallwithin the scope of these final regulations.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Comments: </T3>Many commenters maintained that the administrative feethat the school would be allowed to retain, pursuant to andSection; 682.606(c)(1),would not cover all administrative expenses. Some suggested raising theamount to as much as $500.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Discussion: </T3>A change has been made. The revised rule allows aschool to retain at least 10 percent of tuition and fees paid by a studentthat attends school at all during the loan period, in addition to the $100/5%administrative fee.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">Section 682.607 Payment of a refund to a lender</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Comments: </T3>A number of commenters stated that students often donot officially withdraw. Consequently, the school may not become awareof the student's withdrawal until the start of a subsequent academic period,or the school may not be able to identify the last date of attendance.Many of these commenters believe that the period for paying a refund tothe lender should run from the start of the next academic period afterthat in which the borrower withdraw, as determined under andSection; 682.605(b)(1)(ii).Other commenters urged the Secretary to retain the prior rule, which theyread as requiring that a refund to be sent to the lender within 30 daysof the date of the school's determination that the student has withdrawn.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Discussion: </T3>No change has been made. Current regulations treatthe last recorded date of attendance as the dropout date for students whounofficially withdraw. 34 CFR 668.22. Under the prior regulations, withrespect to an unofficial withdrawal, a refund was required to be sent within30 days of the withdrawal date, <T3>i.e., </T3>the last recorded date of attendance. This date could occurseveral months before the end of the academic period in which the studentceased attendance. The Secretary does not believe this result is consistentwith the administrative practices of many schools in monitoring enrollmentstatus. However, the Secretary continues to be concerned with the lengthof time a refund remains unpaid, because the Secretary is continuing topay interest benefits and special allowance on the full outstanding balanceof the loan even though the funds are no longer needed by the borrowerto pay educational expenses, and because a persistently inflated loan balanceincreases the risk of default. The Secretary believes that a school cannotbe permitted to wait until the beginning of the next academic period todetermine which students have unofficially withdrawn and pay their refunds.The Secretary also believes that, once the school has determined that thestudent has withdrawn, the school should expeditiously process any refundowed, and has therefore revised the regulations to require payment of arefund within 60 days of the date of the school's determination that thestudent has withdrawn. <T3>See </T3>andSection;682.607(c)(2)(iv).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Comments: </T3>Several commenters, suggested that the period in whicha refund must be paid be extended from 30 up to 60 days. They believe that30 days from the earlier of the dates specified in andSection; 682.607(c)(1)does not provide sufficient time to allow for unexpected delays in processingrefunds (<T3>e.g., </T3>computer delays, the involvement of more than one officein the refund process, etc.), and that such a timeframe, immediately followingthe end of an academic period, could create undue administrative burdens.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Discussion: </T3>A change has been made. Section 682.607(c) now requiresthat the school must pay the lender a refund within 60 days of the earlierof the dates specified in andSection; 682.607(c)(1) or, pursuant to andSection;682.607(c)(2), within 60 days after the last day of an approved leave ofabsence when the student does not return to school.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Comments: </T3>Several commenters questioned how the use of the term``semester'' in andSection; 682.607(c)(1)(ii) would apply to schools thatdo not use semesters.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Discussion: </T3>A change has been made.
