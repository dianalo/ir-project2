The term &quot;procedure&quot;is used here to denote a complete program which is embodied in a memberof a LOAD library and executed as a separate job step. Two of the fiveprocedures, PARSE and MDMEXEC, are essential components in all uses ofMDMS30. A third procedure, MDMINPUT, is required whenever MDMS30 is usedto generate a linear programming (LP) model, one of its chief functions.The other two procedures, MDMMERGE and EXTRACT, provide advanced featuresfor use with LP models. Additionally, the HLP30 LP system is required,at least in part, for all LP models generated by MDMS30. This manualis concerned primarily with MDMEXEC and secondarily with PARSE. MDMS30is programmed by the user in a language which is fully explained in theMDMS30 USERS manual. A reader should be thoroughly familiar with thatmanual before attempting to read this one. A program written in the user'slanguage must be processed by PARSE before it can be excuted by MDMEXEC.PARSE is a kind of half-compiler which translates the user's languageinto a compact and easily excuted form which, nevertheless, is stillinterpretive. The PARSE procedure is very fast and is treated essentiallyas a compiler. However, full compilation is not appropriate to a languagesuch as that of MDMS30. MDMEXEC is also fast in almost all respects inspite of its interpretive nature.</TEXT></DOC>
