MooreStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 11/17/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> EUROP T.TDBOND MARKET NEWS (BON)SECURITIES INDUSTRY (SCR) </IN><DATELINE> LONDON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Toronto-Dominion Bank halted Eurobond operations in its London securities unit, swelling a wave of cutbacks in the slumping Eurobond market.    Toronto-Dominion is the second big Canadian bank to curtail Eurobond operations here this month. Two weeks ago, Royal Bank of Canada stopped underwriting and trading Eurobonds and withdrew as a market maker of U.K. government securities. The moves by Montreal-based Royal Bank led to the dismissal of 150 members of its 1,200-person London staff.    Yesterday, another Canadian player in Eurobonds, stockbrokers Dominion Securities Inc., said it has imposed across-the-board pay cuts on its 65 London employees as part of a campaign to trim overhead. Dominion Securities, unrelated to Toronto-Dominion Bank, wouldn't specify the size of the pay cuts. Officials of Dominion Securities said it will remain one of the largest market makers in Canadian dollar-denominated Eurobonds and in Eurodollar bonds issued by Canadian borrowers.    These moves follow similar steps by several other securities firms here recently, reflecting the declining volume of new issues this year. Among those curtailing or withdrawing from Eurobond trading activities lately are Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., Chemical Bank, Bank of America and L.F. Rothschild, Unterberg, Tobin Inc.    Toronto-Dominion, Canada's fifth-largest bank, said its retreat from the $600 billion Eurobond market resulted from a review of operations at its two-year-old London securities unit. &quot;We saw bleak prospects for reaching reasonable profitability next year and little chance of improvement for the foreseeable future,&quot; said A. Douglas King, a senior vice president in London. Ken Foxcroft, a senior vice president in Toronto, described the Eurobond trading group's losses as &quot;very minor.&quot;    The bank said it would try to redeploy its 16 Eurobond staff members within its 150-person London operation. Mr. Foxcroft said many of the 16 will be asked to relocate to Canada to work for its Canadian government and corporate-bond trading group.    Toronto-Dominion was lead manager of only two Eurobond offerings, and made markets in more than 100 Eurobond issues, mostly within the Canadian-dollar sector, Mr. King said.    The Canadian-dollar Eurobond market is overcrowded, with more than 20 international securities firms still making markets in many Canadian issues, securitiesindustry executives estimate. Recent market deregulation in Canada, meanwhile, means Toronto-Dominion will expand its securities activities there, Mr. King said.    Toronto-Dominion's announcement had little effect on Eurobond trading yesterday, which was limited by continuing uncertainty over a possible agreement on the U.S. federal budget deficit. Seasoned fixed-coupon Eurodollar issues were unchanged to slightly lower.    In primary markets, the sole dollar offering was by Yukong Ltd., a South Korean oil company. The issue totaled $50 million of eight-year floating-rate notes paying 1/8 point over the London interbank offered rate at par.    Separately, the Bank of Japan Ltd. issued 100 million European currency units ($121.9 million) of 8 3/8% seven-year Eurobonds, priced at 101 1/2 to yield 8.08%.    Investors gave a cool response to the West German railway's new 6 5/8% bonds due 1997 launched yesterday at 100.25. The reception may have been hurt by the stronger U.S. dollar, which pushed down prices on most West German government and Euromark bonds 1/2 to 3/4 point.    After two weeks of rising prices, the Swiss franc foreign bond market has reached a consolidation phase, with many market participants believing that rates will stabilize around current levels.    ---   Jacquie McNish in Toronto contributed to this article. </TEXT></DOC>
