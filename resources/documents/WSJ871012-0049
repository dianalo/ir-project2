At the meeting, Willy De Clercq, the EC commissioner for trade and external relations, will meet with U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter and government representatives of Britain, France and West Germany, the three main paymasters of the Airbus jetliner consortium.    The purpose of the meeting, one in a long series on the Airbus controversy, is to defuse U.S. anger over the level of the European governments' subsidies to Airbus's chief industrial owners, Aerospatiale of France, Messerschmitt-Boelkow-Blohm G.m.b.H. of West Germany and British Aerospace PLC, EC diplomats said.    U.S. competitors Boeing Co. and McDonnell Douglas Corp. claim Airbus's subsidies allow it to sell aircraft at below cost. Both manufacturers are considering filing countervailing duty or anti-dumping petitions under U.S. law, steps that would probably lead to a transatlantic trade war.    The U.S. government has sought to get the Europeans to agree to a stricter interpretation of aircraft trade agreements in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, but those efforts haven't been successful. The Europeans deny they are violating any trade conventions and claim that the U.S. industry also enjoys indirect government subsidies. </TEXT></DOC>
