Chill.; STICKY CUPCAKES; It must be a commonproblem, judging from readers' responses. Candy Leach of Santa Clara sent thistip to Evelyn Grandinetti of Sunnyvale, who wanted to avoid cupcakes thatstick to their liners: &quot;Pam them. Just spray the muffin cups with non-stick,non-fat vegetable product. Better yet, use waxed paper and make your own cupliners.&quot; Cathe Hamada of Fremont also sent this suggestion.;   Karyn Lucas ofSanta Clara says she avoids sticky cupcakes with Real-Ease (available at cakespecialty stores) and waxed paper liners. Harriet Witmond of San Josesuggested using foil muffin pan liners sprayed with Pam.;   Margaret Larsen ofSanta Clara learned this trick in a class at Cabrillo Community College: &quot;Intoa small spray bottle place 3/4 cup inexpensive vodka and 1 tablespoon soylectin (liquid) and shake well. Spray baking pans and, in this case, liners.The liquor serves to dissolve the lectin and disperse it. The alcoholevaporates in baking, and vodka has no taste to interfere with the flavors inthe food.&quot;;   And Edith Stevens of Los Gatos says that after baking low-fatmuffins she lets them cool and freezes them, then wraps each one with a papertowel and heats them individually in the microwave for about 30 seconds. Thepaper liner then peels off without sticking.; CALLS FOR HELP; &quot;I'm absolutelydesperate to get a recipe that I used some years ago,&quot; writes Karean Hathornof San Jose. She thinks the recipe for chocolate sour-cream cake came from asmall cookbook by either the manufacturers of Gold Medal Flour or BettyCrocker products. Key components are unsweetened cocoa powder, sour cream,powdered sugar, eggs and all-purpose flour. &quot;The cake was popular during the'40s, a favorite of the troops overseas.&quot;  </TEXT><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910911  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Wednesday  </DAY><MONTH>  September  </MONTH><PG.COL>  6C  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  640  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Wednesday, September 11, 199100255462,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
