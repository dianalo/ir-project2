Integrated, which filed for bankruptcy protection twoyears ago, reached a tentative agreement in November to beacquired by Bankers Trust for roughly $210 million. But thedeal has fallen through because of a dispute over what wouldprobably have amounted to only a few million dollars.</LP><TEXT>   Integrated said that it and certain creditor committeesare &quot;continuing discussions&quot; with other potential bidders.The obvious alternative is now the Pritzker family ofChicago, which bid $232 million in November, but was rebuffedbecause Intregrated had already reached its agreement withBankers Trust. A spokeswoman for Penguin Realty AssociatedLP, the real estate arm of the Pritzker family, said, &quot;Weview that {the cancellation of the Bankers Trust agreement}as good news and we're still pursuing an agreement. However,nothing has been signed yet.&quot;   The dispute that caused the Bankers Trust agreement tofall through involved the out-of-pocket expenses the bankincurred in attempting to reach a definitive agreement withthe senior creditors. The U.S. Bankruptcy Court already hadallowed $1.5 million allocated for Bankers Trust's expenses,but the bank reportedly had used that up without reaching theagreement.   Two committees representing senior creditors balked atallowing Bankers Trust to collect any more money fromIntegrated's coffers while negotiations on a definitiveagreement dragged on, persons involved in the negotiationssaid.   The definitive agreement was supposed to have been signedby Jan. 15, after a one-month postponement, but creditorswere reportedly not prepared to come to final terms inJanuary. The creditor committees needed another three monthsto conclude the deal, one official said.   Bankers Trust refused to postpone the definitive agreementfor 90 days without receiving any additional compensation,one executive said. Attorneys for senior creditors declinedcomment or did not return calls.   A spokesman for Bankers Trust said, &quot;We have beendiligently pursuing the acquisition of Integrated Resourcesfor more than a year, and are very disappointed that we havebeen unable to conclude a definitive agreement with itscredit committees.&quot; He declined further comment.   One alternative now being pushed by some creditors is areorganization of the company without selling it to a thirdparty, said Edward Weisfelner, partner at Berlack, Israels andamp;Liberman and attorney for subordinated creditors. He said newsecurities could be issued to creditors backed by thecompany's assets.   Integrated filed for bankruptcy protection in February1990 after defaulting on its commercial paper. The companyhas been shedding assets to raise cash, proceeds of whichwill go toward its $2 billion in liabilities. Most creditorsare expected to receive a fraction of their total claims.   Integrated's assets primarily consist of around $355million in cash; an equipment leasing company; equity stakesin various companies gained through leveraged buyouts; androughly 147 contract rights, which earn a stream of incomefrom part of the lease payments from buildings purchased byIntegrated partnerships. The rights have a cumulativeearnings stream of $1.7 billion over 30 years, but have acurrent value of between $150 million and $200 million, sayanalysts.</TEXT></DOC>
