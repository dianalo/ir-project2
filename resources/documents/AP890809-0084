Mickey Leland and 13 others who disappeared two days ago whileflying to a refugee camp in southwestern Ethiopia.   Ethiopian authorities reported today that a plane had been heardflying Monday near Mizan Teferi, 50 miles south of the Fugnidorefugee camp, where Leland and his entourage were headed.   The twin-engine plane carrying Leland, 44, and the othersvanished during bad weather near Ethiopian-Sudanese border, 480miles southwest of Addis Ababa.   Leland, a Democratic from Houston and the chairman of the HouseSelect Committee on Hunger, was in Ethiopia on a return visitbecause of his keen interest in Africa's refugee problem.   The Twin Otter, a plane commonly used for bush flying in Africa,also carried three members of Leland's staff, a friend of thepolitician, four Americans from the U.S. Embassy and from the U.S.Agency for International Development, and five Ethiopians _ threegovernment officials, the pilot and co-pilot.   Up to 10 small planes were being used in the search today,directed by Ethiopia's Civil Aviation Authority.   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said an Air Force medicalevacuation plane left Germany this morning en route to Addis Ababain case it was needed.   The weather today was markedly better than Tuesday, when heavyclouds and poor visibility hampered planes coursing the coldplateau in Ethiopia, said John Guerra, political officer at theU.S. Embassy in Addis Ababa.   Rescuers continue to focus on a region called Dembidola, about75 miles north of Fugnido where Ethiopian authorities said a smallplane reportedly was heard circling Monday, according to U.S.Embassy officials. The Dembidola region borders Mizan Teferi.   Earlier, embassy officials said they were told the planeactually had been sighted near Dembidola, but today acknowledgedthey had been misinformed.   Dembidola is in an accessible region of foothills betweenmountains that rise up to 12,000 feet and swampy plateausstretching to the Sudanese border. Communications with Dembidoloand Mizan Teferi, as with most areas outside the capital, are badto nonexistent.   U.S. Embassy spokesman James Haley said the search had beenextended slightly across the Sudanese border on the theory Leland'splane had the fuel capacity to go that far and may have crossed theborder to avoid bad weather.   On Tuesday, Robert Houdek, charge d'affairs at the U.S. Embassyin Addis Ababa, said the lack of radio or telecommunications``could provide a benign explanation for why we haven't heardanything.''   Police, security officials and local peasants' associations havebeen enlisted in ground searches along the flight path, said Houdek.   Haley said a U.S. Air Force C-141 medical evacuation aircraftwas expected to arrive later today from West Germany for assistance.   President Bush telephoned Leland's wife, Alison, in Houston onTuesday and promised his administration will do ``all we can tolearn'' the fate of the plane.   ``She's strong, has a lot of hope, and we all pray that he'ssafe,'' Bush told a meeting of the National Urban League inWashington, where delegates observed a moment of silent prayer forLeland's survival.   ``I think it says a lot about Mickey that he was on his sixthhumanitarian mission to help feed the hungry in that part of theworld,'' Bush said.   Leland's Twin Otter left Addis Ababa in poor visibility at about10:30 a.m. Monday after a two-hour delay caused by the bad weather,said embassy officer Guerra.   The plane was last heard from 15 minutes after it took off.   The Americans on board included Patrice Johnson, Leland's chiefof staff; Hugh Johnson of the Hunger committee staff; and Joyce F.Williams of the staff of Rep. Ron Dellums, D-Calif., according toLeland's office in Washington.   Fugnido camp is run by the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugeesand is one of four in the region that house more than 300,000refugees who have fled civil war in neighboring Sudan.</TEXT></DOC>
