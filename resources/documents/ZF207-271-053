So, don't be disappointed if yourcorporation's explicit vision doesn't seem like very much.andM;Attempting to define vision poses problems.andP;  Vision is more than a strategicplanning document.andP;  Perhaps the difference can be explained by noting thatRonald Reagan clearly had a vision, while George Bush doesn't.andP;  A visionisn't a strategy, but it is more akin to strategy than tactics.andM;One of the best ways to determine the corporate vision is to follow theadvice of Richard Nixon's Attorney General and campaign manager JohnMitchell.andP;  He told the media, ''Watch what we do, not what we say.'' In hiscase, it turned out to be bad advice.andP;  But it can be good advice for you.andM;By all means, read the published Corporate Statement of Purpose, if yourcompany has one.andP;  Familiarize yourself with the corporate strategic businessplan.andP;  Metaphorically, you can't build the PC infrastructure if you don'tknow whether the company wants a runway, a highway or railroad tracks.andM;What makes understanding the corporate vision difficult is the frequentdissonance between the explicit vision -- generally prepared for consumptionby the public, shareholders and new employees -- and the implicit visionpropounded by management's daily action.andM;What makes understanding the corporate vision important is its use as theunderlying yardstick against which all actions are measured.andP;  An action thatwins praise in one company could win condemnation in another, because of thediffering vision.andM;Emulation as Best BetandM;Look around.andP;  See where senior management puts its money, time and attention.andO;Emulate them in your own organization.andP;  If they spend their time trimmingexpenses, regardless of consequence, you would be wise to do the same.andM;If quality merits most of management's efforts, strive for quality.andP;  If agood working environment really matters, spend time working on ergonomicworkstations.andM;You can quickly see the problem.andP;  If the company vision involves quality, noone will reward you for cutting costs at the expenses of quality.andP;  If workerhealth, safety and comfort really comes first, buying user-hostile hardwarecould put you in the doghouse.andM;To maximize the effectiveness of the micro organization -- and, notincidentally, your own career opportunities -- figure out what really countsin your organization and concentrate on that.andM;Propagating your own vision downward will prove no easier than it was forsenior management to tell you, explicitly and implicitly, what mattered tothem.andM;For starters, use the same technique in your organization that the companyuses.andP;  If there is a written statement of vision or purpose, start with thatand reduce it to the specifics applicable in your department.andM;If the corporation honors this statement more in the breach than theobservance, make sure your minions do the same.andM;If the company operates entirely on an implicit basis, distill your bestunderstanding of it and pass it on to the people who report to you in avariety of settings, both formal (but unwritten) and informal (over lunch orat parties).andM;$</TEXT></DOC>
