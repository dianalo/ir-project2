These stableorganic radicals react rapidly with a suite of inorganic and organicradicals to form diamagnetic products. In the presence of 250 {mu}m/mLHA and under near-natural light conditions, easily detectable rates ofnitroxide consumption are observed in both air- and Ar-equilibrated samples.However, at a given nitroxide concentration, significantly lower ratesof nitroxide loss are observed in the presence of air, consistent withthe view that O{sub 2} and nitroxides compete for a substantial portionof the total radical pool. The initial rates of loss decrease in theorder cationic andgt; neutral andgt;andgt; anionic, indicating that there is an electrostaticeffect on the rate constants for scavenging. These findings suggest thatnegative charge on the humic influences the efficiency with which nitroxidescan react with radicals on the humic structure. The use of EPR to detectradical scavenging by nitroxides represents a sensitive means for estimatingfree radical photoinitiation rates in mixtures of chemically ill-definedorganic material such as HA.</TEXT></DOC>
