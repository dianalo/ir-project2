Bond trading both in the U.S. and abroad was very light as investors awaited several U.S. economic reports to be released today. The most important probably will be the Commerce Department's report on the trade deficit for May.    The monthly trade reports, which are notoriously unpredictable, frequently have led to major moves in bonds and stocks. Thus, trading volume frequently slows to a trickle just ahead of the report.    A month ago, the report showed an unexpectedly small $9.89 billion deficit in April, which helped drive up bond prices, stocks and the dollar.    This morning's report probably won't be as reassuring, many analysts say. According to the average estimate of 14 analysts polled by Dow Jones Capital Markets Report, the deficit rose to $11.2 billion in May. The figures are seasonally adjusted.    &quot;It was a very quiet day,&quot; said John R. Burrus, president and chief executive officer of CRT Government Securities Ltd. in New York. &quot;People don't want to be overly exposed&quot; in advance of today's trade report.    Banks raised their prime, or base, lending rate to 9 1/2% from 9%. The move &quot;didn't have much impact&quot; on the financial markets, Mr. Burrus said, because &quot;it's something that has been expected for a while.&quot;    Several other reports are expected to provide further confirmation that the economy is expanding rapidly and that inflation is accelerating.    For example, analysts expect a Commerce Department report to show a large increase in producer prices for June, mainly because of higher farm prices caused by the Midwest drought. The producer price index rose 0.5% last month, according to the average estimate of eight economists surveyed by Dow Jones Capital Markets Report. That would follow gains of 0.5% in May and 0.4% in April.    Separately, the Federal Reserve Board will report industrial production figures for June. Analysts say that also is likely to show a 0.5% increase.    Treasury Securities   Treasury bond prices drifted slightly lower in the morning but later bounced back up to finish very close to Wednesday's closing levels.    Traders cited nervousness about today's trade report as the main reason for the slow pace of activity yesterday. Many analysts say a May trade deficit of more than $12 billion would jolt the foreign exchange markets and lead to sharply lower bond prices.    The Treasury's 9 1/8% bonds of 2018 were quoted late yesterday at a price of 99 15/32 to yield 9.17%, unchanged from Wednesday. The latest 10-year Treasury notes rose slightly to 99 13/32 from 99 11/32. The yield fell to 9.09% from 9.10%.    Among short-term rates, the latest three-month Treasury bill was quoted late in the day at 6.73% bid, up from 6.72% Wednesday. The six-month Treasury bill rate climbed to 7.02% bid from 6.98%.    An index of long-term Treasury bonds compiled by Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. inched higher, gaining 0.79 point to close at 1216.61. It hovered in a very tight range all day. The low was 1212.35, and the high was 1217.90. That contrasted sharply with Wednesday, when the index ranged between 1211.47 and 1226.72.    Municipals   State and local government bonds were narrowly mixed.    Some actively traded issues were quoted 1/8 point lower to as much as 1/4 point higher. The New Jersey Turnpike Authority's 7.230% bonds due 2018 were quoted late in the day at a price of 90 bid, to yield 8.10%, unchanged from Wednesday.    New York State's Financial Control Board and the Office of the State Comptroller released their reviews of New York City's latest financial plan for fiscal 1989 through 1992, painting a challenging picture of the financial road ahead for the major municipal note and bond issuer.    &quot;This year's budget and new financial plan differ markedly from those of last year,&quot; said George Gross, executive director of the Financial Control Board, in a cover letter with the review. &quot;Last year the attitude was one of expansion; this year it is one of restraint.&quot;    The board expects the city to accumulate small surpluses of no more than $200 million annually in fiscal years 1989 and 1990.    &quot;In a budget of more than $25 billion, such small surpluses will greatly reduce the city's ability to respond quickly to unexpected revenue shortfalls or unanticipated spending needs. Clearly the city will be operating close to the margin,&quot; Mr. Gross noted.    Still, terming the city's fiscal year 1989 financial plan &quot;reasonably balanced,&quot; the board report said, &quot;While our analysis suggests that adverse developments are possible during the year, city resources, including the general reserve, appear to be adequate to cover any risk that may develop.&quot;    Corporate Issues   Corporate bond prices finished little changed in light trading.    On the new-issue front, activity was light with a total of only $270 million of securities sold by Texas Gas Transmission Corp., Iowa Power andamp; Light Co., and Ford Motor Credit Co.    Meanwhile, Georgia Power Co. is contemplating coming to market next week with a 30-year bond issue. Syndicate officials said they understand the size of the issue will be $250 million. Proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes. Georgia Power is a unit of Southern Co.    Separately, Moody's Investors Service Inc. said corporate takeovers, weakness in consumer-related industries, and problems with nuclear power plants continued to take their toll on the credit quality of the U.S. corporate sector during the second quarter of 1988.    But ratings in the basic industries continued their upward climb, Moody's said.    The rating agency lowered ratings of 65 U.S. corporations, affecting $30.8 billion of debt in the domestic and international credit markets. Ratings of 38 companies were raised during the period, affecting $32.1 billion of outstanding debt.    Some 63% of Moody's rating changes were lower during the quarter, about even with last year's average, but a slight moderation from the first quarter of this year, when 69% were lower.    For the remainder of 1988, Moody's expects &quot;a more even balance between upgrades and downgrades.&quot;    Harold Goldberg, chairman of Moody's corporate rating committee said &quot;strengthening of credit fundamentals in the basic industries is a trend that began last year, sharpened in the second quarter of this year, and should continue through 1989.&quot;    Mortgage-Backed Securities   Ginnie Maes and other mortgage securities were little changed after light trading.    July Ginnie Mae 9% securities were quoted late in the day at 94 bid, up 2/32; 10% securities were at 99 3/4 bid, unchanged; and Freddie Mac 10% securities were at 99 1/2 bid, up 3/32.    The Ginnie Mae 10% issue was yielding 10.16% to a 12-year average life assumption as the spread above the 10-year Treasury note held at 108 basis points.    Remic activity generally was light, although a $200 million deal from Salomon Brothers Inc. was offered. The issue, through the firm's CMO Trust 45, is backed by Freddie Mac 9% securities and has six classes. A remic is a real estate mortgage investment conduit.    Foreign Bonds   Major foreign government bond markets registered little change yesterday.    In Tokyo, Japanese government bond prices ended slightly lower after an uneventful session. Prices moved in a narrow range, as many investors stayed away from the market in advance of Japanese wholesale price data and U.S. trade data due for release today.    The government's benchmark 5% No. 105 issue due 1997 closed at a yield of 5.04% in the interdealer market, up 0.025 percentage point on the day. The range on the session was 4.995% to 5.04%. The closing yield represented a price of 99.74, down 0.16.    Volume was even quieter than recent subdued sessions.    In West Germany, the bond markets showed little reaction to the central bank's decision not to increase rates. The government's 6 1/2% securities due 1998 closed interbank dealing 0.05 point lower at 98.45 bid, to yield 6.72%, up slightly from 6.71% Wednesday.    British gilts also were little changed. The benchmark Treasury 11 3/4% bonds due 2003/2007 ended unchanged at 115 25/32 to yield 9.70%. The Treasury 11 3/4% issue due 1991 fell 5/32 of a point to 103 15/32 to yield 10.10%, while the Treasury 12% issue of 1995 declined 5/32 to 108 30/32 to yield 10.10%. </TEXT></DOC>
