and new editorial/classified softwarefor its system.andP;  Both systems are characterized by new approaches to certainaspects of the overall front-end operation.andM;* CText, running under OS/2 and Presentation Manager, offers some niceadditional functionality in the area of multitasking.andM;* Dewar has rewritten its editorial system, basing it on completely standardversions of XyWrite, and also developed a new classified package.andP;  Both runin the same enviromnent, with all code written in off-the-shelf dBase.andM;The show also provided a good opportunity to get an update on some othersystem progress, including the following items:andM;* Atex announced a new configuration of its traditional system anddemonstrated progress with its microcomputerbased products for magazine andnewspaper markets, including Design Software on the Macintosh, WriterSoftware on the PC, and the PC PageMakeup system.andP;  We were impressed bydevelopments on all three fronts, particularly the improvements to filemanagement on Writer Software.andP;  Atex also showed an IBM version of its PPN.andM;* Camex provided a good look at the Sun-based classified system scheduled tobe installed at the Houston Chronicle this fall, using Sybase for itsdatabase with a full JCS (job Control System) implementation expected.andP;  Alsoshown wcre the latest in page layout for the former Intertext system and aPostScript interpreter to support input of PostScript graphics for theSuperSetter.andM;* CPS discussed a variety of cooperative arrangements in varying stages ofcompletion, including Information Engineering's PC News Layout and, possibly,InterleafandM;* Crosfield's developments spanned most of its product lines as well as itscorporate status.andP;  There is now a real possibility that its parent, De LaRue, will find a &quot;partner.&quot; Crosfield also showed &quot;modemizing&quot; of the 2300system, two new monochrome graphics systems, Imagedit software for handlingcolor, good typographic capabilities for die Color Layout System (Lightspeed)and progress on the NewsWizard.andM;* Cybergraphic made an impressive debut of its support for a family ofcompletely standard workstations on its systems, including PCs andMacintoshes.andM;* Digital Equipment, in reaffirming its focus on supplying the hardware for avariety of software applications, showed an impressive array of products andcapabilities.andM;* Harris demonstrated two new classified systems, both based entirely onoff-the-shelf platforms.andM;* Information International continued to add to its Editor's Page Planner forthe TECS/2 system, which also has been given a &quot;reporter's terminal&quot; at alower price.andM;* Integrated Newspaper Systems International used the occasion for the firstshowing of much of its software, including the new editorial system.andO;Although it's too early to judge the systcm, it has a lot of impressivecapabilities.andM;* Software Consulting Services has added a few wrinkles to its paginationinterface with Quark Xpress.andM;* System integrators and Digital Technology, sharing space as a result oftheir recent cooperative deal, showed new developments and gave an indicationof where their joint efforts will go.andP;  SII showed progress on its InteractiveNews Layout project and better functionality for its Coyote PC.andP;  DTI,meanwhile, showed its editorial software with a new twist in the area ofcopyfttting: let the computer do the work.andM;That's an overview of the topics to be covered in this section, appearing inalphabetical order by vendor.andP;  Many of these companies will be discussed inother sections also.andM;Atex: things old, new, borrowed, BlueandM;Atex showed a little of everything: old products representing its largesystems, new developments for its PC-based products and a new configurationfor its J-11 system, a gimmick that appeared to be borrowed from the DigitalEquipment archives' and, in a secluded area within the booth, an earlyversion of its Publication Production Node (PPN) using EBM hardware.andM;Off the show floor, Atex also conducted &quot;marketing tests&quot; of the PC-based3000 system developed in the United Kingdom.andM;The traditional line.andP;  There was no significant new functionality relating tothe traditional Ate)cts line.andP;  Possibly because of that, die company decidedthat this year it would focus on providing visitors with an overview of thebreadth of Atex's product line.andP;  The avenue it chose to do this was somewhatunorthodox, although it reminded us of an approach DEC used previously atANPA.andP;  It involved hiring professional actors to entertain customers,complete with sound effects and huge puffs of smoke rising to the rafters.andM;The actors gave a canned presentation of how Atex's news aper products fit inthe newspaper offices of today, with some equipment in the booth toillustrate how a late-breaking story is handled in a modem newsroom.andP;  Butthere were none of the traditional long demonstrations of classifiedpagination as groups of prospective customers huddled over terminals; therewere no exhibitions of the latest features about to go into testing at dieBoston Globe; there were none of the standingheight terminals for visitors towalk up to and try.andP;  We heard more than a few comments from newspaper peoplelamenting the drift toward show business at a newspaper productionconference.andM;.&quot;Limited Edition&quot; system.andP;  The one new development announced for Atex'straditional product line wasn't in the area of functionality.andP;  Instead, itwas a new configuration of its system.andP;  Called the Limited Edition, it offersthe capabilities of die full system, but in a smaller package aimed atmid-range newspapers (16 to 64 terminals).andP;  It can be purchased for editorialor classified applications.andM;Hardware includes up to 64 IBM PS/2 workstations (optionally up to 96) andtwo Series 30 J-11 Application Servers, each with a 300-MB SCSI disk.andP;  ThePS/2s function in Atex's PC Preference mode, in which they emulate Atexterminals (using enhanced, 140-key Atex keyboards), rather than asintelligent PCs.andP;  When not used as Atex terminals, they can be booted as PCs.andM;The Limited Edition supports full data redundancy, Atex News Layout andClassified Pagination software, and the addition of a Writer network foreditorial use.andM;Pricing was not available at press time.andM;The New York Times and the PPN-or PC S? The development that was shown toselected prospects has grown out of the huge New York Times order for asystem using IBM hardware for what previously has been called the PublicationProduction Node.andP;  We were told that a name change is under consideration,though, that would make it the PCS: Process Control System.andM;Atex reported that the Times will install release 4.7 of editorial software,release 4.7 of Integrated Advertising Software (IAS), News Layout running onSun workstations and a network to support the first 140 PC Preferenceterminals.andP;  The PPN currently is running on a Vax 8250.andP;  We were told thatthe PC Preference workstations would go into live operation in August.andP;  Atexsaid that the Times had chosen to use its PCs as Preference workstationsrather than as networked PCs running Writer Software.andM;In thebooth was an IBM RT running PPN/PCS software under AIX (the IBM versionof Unix), which Atex said would be the eventual operating system for theTimes installation.andP;  We were told that delivery of the AIX version wasscheduled for the first quarter of 1990.andM;Design Software.andP;  Atex released its Design product the week before ANPA.andP;  Themost recent improvements centered Ion performance, not functions.andP;  The new32-bit RasterOps color board has increased the speed of screen refresh byenabling single-pass painting, rather than one pass for each color (althoughthis wasn't shown in New Orleans).andP;  Rotation of graphics is also much faster.andM;In addition to releasing the standalone product, Atex reported that betatesting has begun for versions interfaced to Scitex, Crosfield and Atexsystems.andP;  An interface to PC PageMakeup systems will be ready by the end ofthe year, we were told.andM;Writer Software.andP;  When we reported on Writer Software last fall, wecomplimented Atex for nmning composition in the Sun file server rather thanin the Atex J -11 Applications Server, but we noted that it wouldn't be aviable product until die Sun supported Atex's traditional, sophisticated filemanagement, including flexible directories, routing, and so on.andM;By ANPA, Atex had taken big strides in this area, demonstrating not only goodbasic file management but somc production tracking as weU.andP;  PC PageMakeupcomposition software was demonstrated in the server.andM;Security is now keyed to the operator who logs on, not to die machine (as isstandard with TCP/IP networks).andP;  The system supports customizable menus thatcan be used, for example, in hiding MS-DOS from the operator.andP;  Help screenshave been implemented to serve as a virtual replacement for die conventionalmanual, and they include -directory help?, for use .andP;  with the customizabledirectory structure.andM;In typical Atex fashion, a variety of directories is abailable including longand short ones customized to the user's specifications, based on headerfields.andM;The main limitation that remains is that selective directories currently canbe generated only from within one MS-DOS directory, not from across multipledirectories.andM;The production tracking feature is based on die customer setting up asequential list of steps each job is to follow (write, edit, proofread,etc.).andP;  Then, as a job completes one of die steps, die operator marks itaccordingly in die -comments&quot; field in the story header.andP;  As part of theprocedure, the system can automatically send, a story from one directory ordesk to another as it moves along sequentially.andP;  A status screen reports thecurrent status of any story.andM;Although composition was already nmning in the Sun server last fall, itcontinues to be enhanced.andP;  After the operator calls for handamp;j, the story openon the screen is sent to the server and returned automatically, with thescreen showing thc depth.andP;  Alternatively, a story can be composed in thebackground and returned on demand by the user.andP;  In contrast to theimplementation in its early showings, the system now handamp;j's die actual textfile, rather than keeping the original and handamp;j'ing a copy.andM;The handamp;j program running in the server can be die onc used in the PCPageMakeup system or the Network Composition program that runs in Atex'sother Sun-based systems.andP;  Writer workstations also can send stories to a J-11system for composition.andM;Atex is sticking to its guns on the question of handamp;j in the PC, at least aslong as the program runs under MS-DOS, saying 640K isn't enough memory to runXyWrite, composition and the other items that are needed.andP;  One plannedenhancement to the current routine, though, is the ability to have the serversend back the file in increments as handamp;j is completed, rather than waiting forthe entire file to finish, as is now the case.andM;A &quot;lookup&quot; function, which tells how the system will hyphenate a word (usinglogic or the large dictionary), is being added but wasn't demonstrated.andM;Another enhancement is the ability to save edited versions of files with .HSTsuffixes for use in tracking die changes made to, a file.andM;As we mentioned in our earlier coverage, Writer networks provide a niceimplementation of Unix mail services and of die Atex mail and broadcastfacilities.andM;Output alternative currently available for Writer networks depend on thecomposition program being run.andP;  With PC PageMakeup, the typesetter driverswritten by Archetype are offered.andP;  With Network Composition, Atex says it wiUhave drivers, but it hasn't identified them yet.andP;  With Writer Software only,die output is PostScript.andM;Atex reported that it has a 110-PC network in operation, but that it isn'trunning handamp;j.andP;  No regular Writer network customers have been given Atexcomposition in the Sun yet.andM;PC PageMakeup.andP;  A couple of new features have been added to the PC PageMakeupprogram, which, as readers are probably aware, originated as a set offeatures also present in Archetype's Designer system for producing displayads.andP;  Atex said some of the new features would be part of a new &quot;generic&quot;product Archetype is developing for sale to Atex in addition to some othercustomers.andM;One main new feature is a &quot;smart columns&quot; capability for flowing textautomatically into multiple columns on a page.andP;  The user specifies the pagewidth, the number of columns and the gutter, plus some optional informationsuch as whether text is to snap to grid lines, whether runarounds areenabled, and whether feathering is permitted for vertical justification.andM;Another addition is the ability to assign text to containers to make it flowautomatically.andP;  As text flows onto the page, die screen indicates how much isleft  over.andM;Jumping text from one page to another is handled by specifying thecontinuation page.andP;  The user can go directly to that page to see the textflow or can go to another page.andM;But the feature we have been waiting for die most hasn't been implementedyet: the ability for an operator at a Writer workstation to compose textagainst the PC PageMakeup layout.andP;  That is still under development.andM;Atex was predicting a July release for the product.andP;  We will keep in dosetouch to see if that comes true.andM;system 3000.andP;  When we presented an early view of System 3000 in April (seeVol.andP;  18, No.andP;  12), we wondered how Atex might sell and support two differentPC systems (this one plus the Writer Network running either PC PageMakeup orNetwork Composition software).andP;  We had been advised that die 3000 wasn'tplanned for sale in the U.S., so support requirements would be much lessdemanding.andM;But when Atex brought the system to a hotel suite near the ANPA show, wewondered if the company might be considering seriously die possibility ofselling it in the U.S.andP;  We were told that no decision had been made.andP;  Thereapparently was an enthusiast response from the people who visited the suite,although one comment we heard was that it suffered from not having anintegrated classified ad package.andM;We will report Atex's decision on its sales plan when we hear it.andM;Camex: more than just the ad sideandM;Much of the excitement in the Camex booth centered on the new Mac-based admake-up product.andP;  But Camex also had a few things to show on the system side.andO;It featured live pagination demonstrations of both editorial and class adpages, including scanned art and photographs and incorporating completedisplay ads on output.andP;  Camex calls these capabailities &quot;add-on pagination&quot;because they can work with existing editorial or dassified systems:classified based on the CAP system; editorial based on an extension of theIntertext system.andM;Since its acquisition of Intertext, sales of this product line have been lessthan dramatic (eight editorial systems are now installed, six of whichhappened after the acquisition).andP;  Camex says its new pagination direction,which was shown first at America East (see Vol.andP;  18, No.andP;  15), has sparkedsubstantial new interest in the product.andP;  Camex hopes, of course, that newsales of the editorial system will generate additional sales of display adsystems.andM;One of the announcements at ANPA was of the first customer site for theeditorial pagination product.andM;The Intertext software always had a modular make-up capability.andP;  This allowedan editor to fill in a form to select the number and depth of columns andother typographic parameters.andP;  But the idea was a story-by-story a roach tomodular make-up, not full-page make-up.andP;  Camcx has now added a ncw dimensionto the package for full-page make-up.andM;In a similar manner to the way editors would specify die parameters of astory, they can now extend die concept to the parameters of a page.andP;  Byadding the column number and depth in which a story is to begin, modularlymade-up stories can be placed on pages.andP;  In addition to this x/y-coordinatestyle of layout (which is very similar to the original Cybergraphk approach),Camex can now show a diagrammatic representation of a page-similar to theHastech Magician product.. Body type is shown as horizontal lines of theactual length of each text line.andP;  This now gives the editor a view of how anentire page will look, showing overset and underset stories plus widows andorphans.andM;The first installation is destined for Halifax, Nova Scotia.andP;  The plan isfirst to prepare a dummy manually on paper and then to transfer theinformation via the Intertext menus.andP;  Camex also plans to offer an electronicdummying scheme.andP;  It has shown the Information Engineering layout software atnewspaper shows in the past.andP;  We assume that this is still planned forintegration with the new Intertext page make-up scheme.andM;Camex has always believed that pagination should begin with a total adsolution.andP;  This new capability is no exception.andP;  The diagrammaticrepresentations of the page on the Intertextscreens show dummy holes for allelements of the page, including display ads.andP;  At output time, these pageelements (not seen in full WYSIWYG format) will be merged with the textportion of the page.andP;  This merger will occur in the Camex SuperSetters.andM;Houston progress.andP;  Camex also demonstrated progress on its developments forthe Houston Chronicle.andP;  It showed the systems class ad portion, which usesSun workstations linked to an IBM mainframe file server.andP;  The mainfi-mne runsthe Neasi-Weber AdMark system.andP;  The Sun-based Camex system is on-line to theIBM/AdMark system at all times.andM;When an ad is begun, the phone number is sent to the mainframe for creditchecking, rating and other &quot;frequent customer profile information.andP;  Theactual rating takes place within the Sun system itself The IBM system alsoassigns the ad number.andP;  Therefore, all subsequent queries are against the IBMdatabase, which stores all the header information about each ad.andP;  The text ofeach ad is retained in the Suns.andP;  On a nightly basis, the IBM database andthe Sun database are compared for any discrepancies.andM;On the Camex side of the picture will be four Sun-4 processors, which willact as the database for all advertising-class ads as well as ROP.andP;  Camex willuse Sybase for its database on the Sun-4s.andP;  The current plans call forSun-3/80 terminals for all classified users.andM;The user terminals will be set up with multiple windows for each of the basicclass ad taking operations (such as filling in headers with customerinformation, scheduling and rating ads, and entering text).andP;  Each terminalwill eventually support the full Camex WYSIWYG editor and composition.andO;Therefore, simple classified ads marked up with Camex composition commandscan be viewed in WYSIWYG form on the same screen.andP;  Queries to the databaseare handled via a fill-in-the-blank menu, which in tum becomes an SQL queryto the Sybase database.andP;  The menus we saw were samples of what Camex and theChronicle are planning.andP;  Also planned are multiple menus to handle multiplerun schedules and calendars to help in the ad scheduling process.andM;All rating algorithms in the Sun file servers will be programmed in Cobol.andO;Camex feels that this is the programmer's language of choice in the financialside of the business and therefore customers would be weU equipped to writesome of their own routines for extending the rate structures supplied to theby Camex.andM;Camex is planning a full JCS implementation of Sybase for display ad graphicson July 11.andP;  The classified system on the Suns is now scheduled for the fall.andO;The editorial system will follow.andM;PostScript output.andP;  In the output area, Camex was displaying its latest setof recorders: the Bidco color recorder and the Linotronic 500 as itsupper-end color workhorses.andP;  A less expensive solution would include an Ultrerecorder.andP;  It showed for die first time a Shinko 11&quot;x 17&quot;, 300-dpi thermalcolor printer for proofing, and had press proofs and Chromalins of mechanicalprocess color.andP;  For plain paper, Camex will support both the GraphicEnterprises (in roughly the $40,000 range) and the 11&quot; x 17&quot; Canon engine.andM;Our biggest question to Camex regarded PostScript.andP;  Camex has decided tooffer PostScript within its system to accommodate input from other sources.andO;However, its own systems (such as the Breeze terminals with full graphics)are still geared for output in the Camex SPDL language.andP;  To accommodatePostScript input, Camex wrote its own Postscript-toSPDL translator.andP;  Thissoftware runs in the Camex file server and converts standard PostScript filesto SPDL (the native language on the SuperSetter typesetters).andM;[More coverage of Camex appears under Display ads.]andM;CPS: Let's make a dealandM;Computer Peripheral Sciences is appearing more and more like the UnitedNations of publishing systems, with a tendency to exhibit more of othercompanies' software than it shows of its own.andP;  ANPA was no exception.andP;  CPSwas running Serifs PageStar display ad system on a PC, which is being gearedto serve also as an interactive pagination workstation, plus DigitalTechnology's AdSpeed on the Macintosh II.andP;  New to the booth' was InterleafPublisher on the Macintosh, which was part of a marketing test by bothcompanies.andP;  And, as at previous shows, Ventura Publisher was in evidence forpagination, using the Astrotek 3000 Plus '386 processor as a link to theAstrotek database.andM;But Ventura isn't being seen as the ideal long-mn pagination solution.andP;  CPSis looking toward Information Engineering to supply its PC News Layoutprogram for making up news pages.andM;CPS says that it plans to integrate most of these products fully into onesystem, with the exception of Interleaf, which is only a test and isn't partof any specific long-run plans.andP;  No commitments have been made regarding aschedule for this ambitious task.andM;The Serif deal, which is the farthest along in development, provides CPS withthe software source code.andP;  CPS plans to use PageStar both for display adcreation and for last-minute, interactive changes to pages that have beendummied using PC News Layout.andM;Regarding its own Astrotek software, CPS is working on moving morefunctionality into the PC, although handamp;j still runs within the Astrotek CPU.andO;The most notable change was a &quot;new look&quot; involving the use of popup menus andwindows to modemize the user interface.andP;  Keyboard shortcuts are available tobypass unneeded menu functions.andM;Crosfield enhances full lineandM;Crosfield brought significant enhancements to much of its product line.andP;  Butmany of the newspaper management people we talked to were equally asinterested in the fate of Crosfield under die De La Rue umbrella.andP;  just priorto the show, several British publications reported that Crosfield was lookingfor a partner to share the rewards and risks of doing business in thepublishing arena.andP;  Crosfield explained what this all meant.andM;Corporate questions.andP;  Originally Crosfield was a small entity under De LaRue.andP;  While it remained a relative entity within the larger corporateenvironment, the cyclical profits of a typical publishing supplier were easyto manage.andP;  As Crosfield became a much larger portion of the De La Rue profitpicture (closer to die 50% mark), the cyclical realities of the businessbecame a much bigger concem to a company that would rather manage a steadierprofit profile.andM;Therefore, De La Rue has decided to lessen the dependency of its overallprofit picture on such a large portion as Crosfield.andP;  The fact thatCrosfield's profits dropped last year from roughly 21 million pounds the yearbefore to a little over 5 million this year must have had something to dowith this decision.andM;The plan is to find a partner that will add synergy to the business(therefore a candidate from die industry) and that will share the expensesand the profits.andP;  Crosfield says that an' acquisition by another company isnot cuff enfly being contemplated.andP;  Crosfield said it expects the partner tobe named within approximately 60 days.andM;The 2300 system.andP;  On the equipment side, there were a few changes to the 2300system, The Magician terminal now supports panning and a full 1:1 modedisplay.andP;  It can place on a page both presized contone graphics in eitherMonotype or ImagiTex format and presized EPS graphics originating from anysource.andP;  However, EPS graphics are not displayable yet (except as a graybounding box with name and size information).andP;  This display capability,together with the ability to crop, size and rotate, is planned for IFRA inOctober.andP;  Cropping, sizing and rotating will take place both on Crosfield'sown Galaxy graphic subsystem and on Monotype's.andP;  It is not currently plannedfor ImagiTex.andP;  When this is done, the Magician will have 100% of thefunctionality of the older Hastech PagePro terminals.andM;The 2300 is also adding more &quot;fourth-wave&quot; functionality.andP;  It supports anEthernet link using Novell's Netware software.andP;  This allows a network of PCs(running-you guessed it-XyWrite) to be connected directly to thc host DEC 11file servers.andP;  A separate MS-DOS format drive partition is designated on thehost.andP;  The user can access files there via a keyboard macro from withinXyWrite.andM;These advances turn the 2300 into a system where proprietary hardware andsoftware are being used for copyfitting, page assembly and file serving,while off-the-shelf PCs are used for everything else.andP;  The 2300 is still avery proprietary system, but at least the direction it wiU take towardreaching the fourth wave is a bit ckarer.andM;Graphics.andP;  There were also significant enhancements to die Crosfield graphicsystems.andP;  Crosfield is using two systems for graphics input for news and ads.andO;Collectively the graphic products come under the name System 2700.andM;The low-cost PC station for scanning line art and logos from a Xerox 7650 iscalled the 2710.andP;  We first reviewed this product at EPEX last fall.andM;For higher-resolution work and contone images, Crosfield is now offering itsown Galaxy terminal.andP;  In die 2700 product family this will be called the2750.andP;  The 2750 will be released for production by the first of next year.andO;It is a monochrome version of the Galaxy workstation Crosfield will beoffering for high-quality color work.andM;The monochrome version runs under Unix and supports 256 levels of gray.andP;  Itsupports TIFF as an input format (from scanners such as the Autokon), butdoes not usc TIFF as its internal format.andM;The 2750 comes configured with 16 MB of memory and a 135-MB internal drive(for the operating systcm) and three 300-MB drives for image storage.andP;  A 2-GBstreamer tape is used for off-line storage.andP;  The 2750 uses a 19&quot; gray-scalemonitor that paints 1,280 x 1,024 pixels.andP;  It comes with a PC-style keyboardand a three-button mouse.andM;One of the unique features of this high-speed device is its ability to writeand retrieve images from disk quickly.andP;  It can simultaneously read and writeto all, three image disks (a feature needed when writing CMY separations todisk).andM;Eventually the 2750 will also support Crosfield's own Newsline input forphoto capture and storage.andP;  In conjunction with products such as the AdWizardand NewsWizard, it will process instructions to crop, size and rotatehigh-resolution data stored in die 2700 system.andM;Imagedit.andP;  Another product Crosfield inn-oduced at the show was alow(er)-cost color image editing station called &quot;Imagedit.&quot; It provides anoff-line solution to previewing, manipulating and minor retouching andediting of high-resolution color images.andP;  This can be used prior to finalscanning or input to a page composition system (such as Crosfiled's Studiosystems).andM;The product can capture images from any of Crosfield's scanners.andP;  By beingoff-line with the scanner, image editing or setup can be done for one jobwhile a second image is being scanned.andM;The station allows the storage and use of Pantone's colors or simplyselecting colors from a viewed image as they may be applied to a background.andO;Individual pixel editing, painting, retouching, sharpening, soft edgetreatment and other special effects are all supported on the terminal.andO;Currently it comes close to what can be done on a Studio system, and all theStudio functionality may follow eventually.andM;Lightspeed Color Layout System.andP;  New to the CLS (Color Layout System) is theaddition of a video frame grabber, This can input any NTSC signal videopicture into the system.andP;  It can also support input of 35mm slides.andP;  As wehave seen in the past, the system also supports reflective scanned imagesfrom a Howtek color scanner.andP;  This just about completes the system with theability, to take any form of color image into the system.andM;On the output side, Crosfield Lightspeed can now drive a Matrix film recorderin addition to its previously supported output to a Mitsubishi color thermaltransfer printer and color electronic prepress systems.andP;  At the functionallevel, many typographic features have been added to the CLS.andP;  These will bereleased in Version 2.0 at the end of this summer.andP;  They will bring a higherlevel of typographic sophistication to the graphic designer for -bothdomestic and international composition.andP;  Included are kerning, runarounds,filling shapes, snaked columns, and foreign accents and hypenation.andM;NewsWizard.andP;  The latest developments on the NewsWizard front were also ondisplay.andP;  The product is still not ready for any production work, but it isshowing steady improvements.andP;  It now supports space reservation of text (fromany front-end system).andP;  Geometry of stories can now be specified (similar todie approach taken on the Magician).andP;  This geometry can be sent to a specialqueue, where it can be accessed from any front end (including Crosfield's).andO;The next important step of integrating this electronic geometry directly intoa form the frontend can use is stiU at a level of detail that remains to beseen.andM;The terminal can now support the reservation of an), ad or editorial graphiccomponent.andP;  These graphic components can come from either the 2700 system oran external device (currently the Monotype graphic subsystem is supported).andO;The terminal also supports all of the composition tools of the AdWizard,since it is based on the same AComp composition language.andP;  The user interfacefor the NewsWizard is the same (with some functional differences) as that ofthe AdWizard.andP;  Crosfield plans to use the flexibility of the AComp languageto emulate the composition of any front-end system.andP;  The Baltimore Sun willbe a good trial test to see how close this can be done (Baltimore will bedoing copy fitting on its SII system using STYL).andM;[More coverage of Crosfield appears in the section on &quot;Wire Services.&quot;]andM;Dateline Chicago for CTextandM;One of the key new developments at the show was the Chicago Tribune systembeing developed by CText.andP;  In fact, the software being demonstrated was theactual code set for deliver), in June for the Chicago contract.andP;  The productnow has a name-Datefine.andP;  Dateline is the editorial product, based on OS/2using Presentation Manager.andP;  All of the programs wcre written in C + + .andP;  Itwill run on a Tandem platform, which CText calls System 10.andP;  CurrentlyDateline is the only System 10 application, and System 10 is Dateline's onlyplatform, but it will be ported soon to other platforms.andM;We talked to both the Tribune and CText and got the same story regardingprogress: &quot;The system is stiff on achedule-maybe a bit ahead of schedule.&quot;andO;There were a few minor problems to sort out, but, according to the Tribune,&quot;There were no show stoppers-just progress.&quot;andM;All parties involved had hoped that Xyquest would have the OS/2 PresentationManager editor to demonstrate at the show, although it wasn't scheduled to beready for another couple of weeks.andP;  It is believed to be still on schedule,but it was disappointing that it wasn't shown in New Orleans.andP;  Nonetheless,although the editor wasn't ready to be put on display, a lot more was.andM;File management.andP;  Crext showed some pretty impressive application featuresrunning both within a user workstation ('386 clone) and across the network toa CLX Tandem computer.andP;  The most important aspect to what we saw was thefirst practical use of a multitasking environment sitting on the user'sdesktop.andP;  The performance within the '386 PC hadn't been optimized, butwriters and editors could see how die multitasking environment would clearlybe beneficial to their jobs.andM;At the show, we had several programs (up to seven at one point) runningsimultaneously.andP;  Some of these were dynamic directory updating-one of thefeatures Chicago demanded.andP;  This means that once a directory has been builtby a user (based on simple or complex selection criteria), the host willcontinually update the directory as more stories that satisfy thc criteriaenter the system (or queues).andP;  Thus, an editor may build a wire directory, apersonal directory and a sports department directory as he begins his job.andO;Then he may work through the day, never having to build another directoryagain.andP;  Once thc data for the directory is in the workstation, oflier ways ofpresenting die data (selecting long or short forms), sorting the stories bymultiple fields using a host of boolean expressions, and other directorymanipulations can be made-witjout ever having to query the host.andP;  This shouldgreatly reduce the number of host database accesses and put more of theediting task squarely in the hands of the user (and his PC).andM;There are two directory &quot;templates.&quot; One template govems what you want to me,and the other controls haw you want it displayed.andP;  Both are customizable andboth can be named and added to Presentation Manager's pulldown menus forlater use.andP;  These directory functions can also be assigned to keys.andP;  Whilemultiple directories are active within the terminal, thea can be reduced tosmall icons so they won't clutter die display.andM;In addition to general directory selection based on predefined criteria,there is a fast ad hoc story locator feature.andP;  Using this method, the usersimply fills in a blank header and the system (accessing the Tandems) buildsa list of all stories satisfying the ad hoc query.andP;  This also supportsboolean expressions-both logical and relational.andP;  In turn, these queriesgenerate SQL requests to the Tandem database.andM;Files in directories can also be marked for batch file managementtasks-sending of files to one or many different places, manual purging, etc.andO;The header fields in the directories are also editable (subject to authoritylevels and protected field locks).andM;Other programs.andP;  In addition to directory functions, other programs runsimultaneously-some in the foreground and some in the background.andP;  Forexample, a messaging capability provides a method whereby one user can send amessage to another user, leave a telephone-type message, or broadcast amessage to a large group of users.andP;  During these tasks, the user can performother editing duties.andM;Ctext also did a nice job of allowing the use of most of the directoryselection, display and access functionality during message activities.andM;Other programs for auto telephone dialing, library access and terminalemulation were also demonstrated as part of the simultaneous multitaskingcapabilities.andP;  In essence, anything that could be run under PM could be runas a secondary foreground or background task.andM;Queue structure.andP;  The queue structure is set up using CWorthy, which issimilar to the way queues are established when setting up a Novell system.andO;This process is used to establish queues, groups, users, etc., tag aUsecurity, and establish tasks for each queue.andP;  Once the original release isinstalled in Chicago, this program will also move to Presentation Manager.andO;(Crext began the work on this part of the system PM was available.)andM;Crext calls the queues &quot;object oriented.&quot; This is not far from what Atexreferred to as work-listed queue.andP;  Each queue has an associated list of tasksattached to it.andP;  In its simplest form, a queue holds stories that enter it.andO;A more complicated task would be to operate on any story entering the queue(including any system function that can be applied to a story), such asrenaming a file, sending it to another queue, and updating certain fieldswithin the queue.andP;  Files can be placed in a queue that wiU require certainuser functions, for example, a manual release of a story to insure thatsomeone has reviewed it.andM;There are currently five levels of hierarchy to the queue structure.andO;Security can be applied to nearly any conceivable level or combination oflevels.andP;  Individual users as well as established groups can be assignedvarious access rights to any queue.andP;  Individual rights override group rights,which gives the newspaper considerable control over access to any material inthe system.andM;One of the programs run under PM is a simple log-on procedure that loads auser profile into the workstation.andP;  The program also checks to see if thelatest software is resident in the workstation.andP;  If not, it automaticallydownloads the appropriate version.andP;  In addition to handling queue and storyaccess rights, it handles feature and function security on a totallyfree-form basis.andP;  Therefore, unlike some older systems that set up groups ofrights to access certain functions, each user has his own set of functionalsecurity for every fimction in die system.andP;  For simplicity, group rights canalso be established, but these rights can be modified by preventing certainusers from performing specific functions.andM;System architecture.andP;  The system architecture for Chicago is also taking moreshape.andP;  The main system wiU have eight Tandem processors in four standardracks, connected by Tandem's Dynabus.andP;  Each Tandem will have up to 16individual Ethernet links that branch out to eight more Ethernet channelseach.andP;  Off of each sub-Ethernet link will be six to eight PCs.andM;There are two reasons for this dual-Ethemet approach.andP;  The split from 16Ethemet links out of the CPU to eight branches each is a current Tandemrequirement.andP;  Tandem doesn't support all levels of protocols on the Ethemetnetwork and requires a universal adapter to convert various protocols into asingle protocol it works with.andP;  We have reason to believe this will changesoon.andP;  The second level of branching to six to eight termninals per Ethernetlink is a Chicago specification to reduce the possible number of &quot;physical&quot;break points in the network.andP;  A physical break in any one network will onlyaffect six to eight terminals at the most.andM;Cybergraphic on standard workstationsandM;For die first time, Cybergraphic demonstrated its use of standard PCs andMacintoshes as full-function workstations.andP;  (In the past, they had worked onthe system, but they hadn't supported the full functionality in the terminal.andO;In addition, the PC had required a special 68000 board, which is no longerneeded.)andM;In New Orleans, PCs and Macs were using the same software as the CGS 150terminal.andP;  The PC is currently running under the Xenix operating system, butlater it also will be available running under MS-DOS.andP;  On the Macintosh, theuser interface is the same as Cybergraphic's own, rather than theconventional Mac interface.andM;We were impressed with the performance being achieved on the new platforms.andO;In comparison with the CGS 150, which runs handamp;j at a quick 2,200 charactersper second, the Macintosh II flies at 10,000 cps, while a Sun-3/60 nearlygoes into orbit at 15,000 cps.andM;All of the terminals provide both a monospaced and a WYSIWYG editingcapability, which enables the terminals to be used for a wide range offunctions.andP;  One ongoing development is to enhance the functionality of theWYSIWYG operation to bc able to handle efficient make-up of display ads.andM;Cybergraphic now feels that it has established itself as an American vendor.andO;Most of its software development is carried out in Bedford, NH, and it hasopened another U.S.andP;  office in the northwestern part of the country.andP;  But itstill has a substantial presence in Australia, with offices in Sydney and Meandamp;bourne, where it has its largest user  base.andM;Dewar: XyWrite and dBase IVandM;Dewar had one of the more interesting booths among die vendors of front-endclassified and editorial systems.andP;  Once thcts champion of proprietaryhardware and software, Dewar has now taken the idea of &quot;off-the-shelf' to thelimit.andP;  It brought its latest developments in both classified and editorialsystems to New Orleans, although we feel they are still a few months awayfrom being what we would consider &quot;production ready.&quot;andM;Both systems are based almost entirely on off-the-shelf hardware andsoftware.andP;  Dewar's contribution was the composition program and someintegration.andP;  Both systems are based on XyWrite (what newspaper systemsaren't these days?) and dBase IV.andP;  But unlike most of the other vendors,which have contracted with Xyquest for the proper hooks and specialenhancements to make XyWrite work optimally with their programs, Dewar isusing a shrink-wrapped version of the program-direcdy from the local computerstore.andP;  Dewar would like to finish the system without having to rely on aspecial version of the program, although we aren't sure this will be ideal.andO;We have to admit, though, that what it brought to ANPA shows that this planis possible.andM;All of the programming for the new product is currently in the dBaselanguage.andP;  Dewar is tooking at Windows, but it is hoping to be able to staywith dBase'We were told that this could change if alternate databases offereda better future.andM;The system will run on any PC or clone running DOS, and on an Ethernet linkusing Novell networking software.andP;  At the show it was nmning on an Arcnetcable, since this (like Ethernet and token ring) is an acceptable physicalconnection for Novell.andP;  But Ethemet with Novell's Netware 2.15 will be thebasic offering from this point on.andM;Like most of the more modem systems, the Dewar editorial system supports agood mail and message capability.andP;  It also provides a convenient &quot;to do&quot; orwork list for each writer and editor.andP;  This would automatically include mailor telephone messages that have to be answered, and related tasks that mustbe carried out.andM;Benefits of dBase.andP;  Although XyWrite could be used for the creation of filesor stories, the system is better suited for a split in functionality: dBasefor file management, directory building and system functions, and XyWrite forwriting and editing.andP;  Therefore, stories are generally created in dBase,where the user can specify other header parameters such as department, page,section, originator and other information provided by dBase itself For now,this means using only eight characters for file names.andM;The use of dBase gives the user great flexibility and power for buildingdirectories and finding and moving stories.andP;  All these functions areperformed from dBase.andP;  Building directories is a simple matter of filling ina blank header form with selection criteria.andP;  More complicated nesting ofboolean expressions against these fields is planned for the final product.andO;Also planned is an ability to modify directory header fields directly.andM;Once a story header is created using dBase, a single keystroke opens afamiliar XyWrite screen where die user can write and edit copy.andP;  StandardDewar markup commands can be embedded in the XvWrite file.andP;  When the story iscompleted, it can be handamp;j'ed and previewed in a static WYSIWYG display.andP;  Thisrequires two more screen displays.andM;Currently headfit is done in a Dewar composition acreen display.andP;  This isvery similar to the XyWrite screen, but under control of Dewar composition.andO;The user is shown the headline size in picas and points and, as he types, thescreen shows thc number of lower-case letter E's that will fill outtheheadline.andP;  This same screen is used to present the handamp;j'ed copy composedusing standard Dewar composition.andP;  There is no tracking between the Dewarcomposition display and the XyWrite screen (such as to see how certainparagraphs are broken).andP;  However, Dewar provides a soft preview to see diecopy in a WYSIWYG format using a set of generic fonts.andP;  The set widths of thecharacters and their placement are accurate.andM;All handamp;j and composition is run in the PC.andP;  Dewar currently uses the XyWritebold mode to represent bold within its composition language, and italic andstrikethrough modes are also supported.andM;Online documentation and context-sensitive help are in the experimentalstage.andP;  Dewar is pleased with the capabilities dBase provides in -theseareas.andM;Our impressions.andP;  We are impressed with die degree to which Dewar has beenable to integrate off-the-shelf software packages with its own composition tocreate a modem system that will be very competitive in the medium-sizednewspaper (and possibly magazine) market.andP;  It proves that the task ofintegrating off-the-shelf software is possible.andM;But it also points out the need for an integrator.andP;  Even when the integratoris a well-equipped and knowledgeable vendor such as Dewar, some of therefinements we have come to expect are conspicuous by their absence.andP;  Thiscomment applies more to the screen presentation of the overall product thanto die basic functionality, which Dewar has been able to provide.andM;For example, we found it a bit disconcerting to jump from one screenpresentation to another (four in all for a typical editing cycle).andP;  Thiswasn't a problem of work for the user, since in most cases the switch fromone screen presentation to another was automatic or a single keystroke atbest.andP;  But requiring the user to see different screens left us with thefeeling that there was more refinement needed in the integration of theoff-the-shelf components.andM;We think a move to Windows or Presentation Manager will be a big help in thisdirection.andM;Dewar has sold four or five of the new systems and, in general, isn't pushingthe older version of its product.andP;  None of the new systems have beeninstalled yet.andP;  The next step is to get the balance of its productsintegrated with the new database (display ad and pagination).andP;  But one thingis dear: it is thoroughly committed to standards and off-the-shelfcomponents.andM;Classified.andP;  Dewar is using the same dBase IV structure for its newclassified product.andP;  In a combined system, the classified data looks likeanother dBase database to the control software.andM;Most of the classified operation is controlled via dBase.andP;  The initial adform is a simple fill-in-the-blank dBase form.andP;  Data for customers known tothe system is automatically filled in.andP;  Dewar has programmed in some fieldverification, both within the form and between multiple forms (which it callspanels).andP;  Multiple-window screens are used to display context-' sensitivehelp (partially for rate codes, classifications and product codes).andO;Scheduling is by calendar (which will eventually be a scrollable, perpetualcalendar).andM;For ads appearing in multiple publications, Dewar is planning to address thissticky problem using multiple calendars.andM;When the ad form is completed, XyWrite is kicked in as the writing tool on aseparate screen.andP;  As with the editorial system, Dewar jumps to its owncomposition screen for handamp;j.andP;  However, the results of the composition processand the rating are displayed in multiple XyWrite windows.andP;  In this way, theuser can see both the ad's content and its price and size.andM;Rating will be handled both by standard tables that the user can modify andby customized rating structures that the user can program himself usingdBase, Basic or any other programming language.andP;  Dewar will also provide alist of prewritten algorithms the user can load into his system.andP;  The programuses Dewar's soft-typesetting module to display the ad in a static WYSIWYGdisplay.andM;The integration between XyWrite and dBase for classified use is a bit closerthan for editorial.andP;  For example, within XyWrite the user can change some ofthe header fields and reprice the ad.andP;  Dewar would like to go much fartherand make the integration &quot;seamless&quot; without having to modify XyWrite.andP;  Fornow, moving between XyWrite and dBase is stiU a bit jumpy.andM;Other features that are controlled via dBase are added charges such as boxcharges and extras, as weU as a nice credit card checking facility that wiUdial via a modem for on-fine credit checking.andP;  DBase also provides anexcellent facility for finding ads using boolean expressions andmultiple-field selection criteria.andP;  One thing that dBase should also provide(but that is not implemented yet) is a routing scheme to move ads to variousqueues based on conditions or information in field headers (class types,credit problems, etc.).andM;Dewar is not offering any specific billing package yet.andP;  Reports areavailable from dBase.andM;Classified pagination.andP;  On the classified pagination side, Dewar hascontinued to add enhancements to its older package.andP;  Although no pureback-end classified pagination product is available, it is planning to offera Camex-like product where it could take typeset files into the system(supporting most of the more common typesetter languages) and paginate diedump and re-output the classified ads in paginated form.andP;  For now theconcentration is on the basic ad-taking package, which Dewar plans to haveready for delivery by die third quarter of this year.andM;DEC wired all over the buildingandM;To take in the full scope of the Digital Equipment offering, it was necessarynot only to visit the DEC booth and the booths of its partners, but also totook high overhead to see the thin Ethernet cable stretching up to therafters, across the hall and down into the various booths that were sharinghardware and data with DEC. Crosfield and DEC were sharing servers.andP;  A HyphenPostScript RIP running in a DEC 3100 workstation was processing data to drivean ECRM PelBox that was located perhaps halfway across the hall.andP;  It was verymuch a sign of the times in these days of standardization and cooperation.andM;As usual, the DEC booth itself was an exercise in cooperation, featuring avariety of applications running on Digital hardware, with three differentnetwork protocols coexisting: LocalTalk, TCP/IP and DECnet.andM;In the &quot;fourth-wave&quot; portion of the booth, Tandy (DEC) and Compaq PCs wererunning XyWrite, feeding data to Macintosh II's running Quark Xpress andAlisatalk.andP;  A XyWrite filter permitted text to be brought right into Xpressfor pagination.andP;  A DEC 3100 workstation ran Hyphen's software PostScript RITand drove a PelBox in the ECRM booth.andM;There was also a new joint development between thc Associated Press andDigital Software Services, which we discuss under &quot;Wire services.&quot; Otherproducts being shown included Display PostScript under DECwindows, Odesta'sODMS on a Macintosh, and the Collier-Jackson business software.andM;The message.andP;  The DEC booth wasn't intended to sell software-in fact, DECwon't sell XyWrite, Xpress or ODMS.andP;  It was intended to appeal to systemintegrators and people interested in OEM deals.andP;  DEC's message was that ithas hardware solutions for people who want to be their own integrators.andP;  Thesoftware on display indicated the kinds of things that can be done using DEChardware.andM;DEC will support its own hardware after it has been installed in the field,in much the same way as other hardware vendors.andP;  But DEC isn't in the systemintegration business.andP;  &quot;If a newspaper comes here looking for a turnkeysystem, we tell diem to go see Crosfield, Dewar or another supplier,&quot; we weretold.andM;Harris shows new classified systemandM;Harris demonstrated two new versions of its classified ad product, both usingtotally off-the-shelf hardware.andP;  One utilizes intelligent network cards andTCP/IP protocol for communication between the workstations and file servers,which are 16MHz '386 PCs with 4 MB of memory and dual 86-MB disk drives formirror recording.andP;  Optionally, 25-MHz, 8-MB versions are available, with300-MB disks.andM;A smaller version of that system uses standard ASCII terminals configuredwith Harris-supplied keyboard PROMs designed for classified applications.andP;  Itruns the same software as the other system.andP;  A similar product can be usedfor remote applications.andM;Triple-1: activity on all frontsandM;Information International, which may have had more new developments than anyother vendor, offered a high-resolution imagesetter and facsimile equipment,which are covered under &quot;Output,&quot; and new features and an Ad Manager for itsAMS/2 ad make-up station, which are discussed under &quot;Display ads.&quot;andM;In the system arena, we took a look at the current state of the Editoes PagePlanner system that had been talked about a year ago, shown in early formlast fall at IFRA, and given a formal introduction at the Seybold Seminars inMarch.andP;  We are impressed by die continuing progress, including the nice,mouse-driven user interface.andM;We like the fact that the page can be designed in a &quot;layoutdriven&quot; manner byspecifying arbitrary areas or by using block sizes based on lengths ofstories already composed.andP;  We also liked the customizable use of colors.andM;Ad dummies can be brought in from Triple-I's Layout Advisor, SoftwareConsulting Services' Layout-8000, SII Layout or Collier-Jackson's CJ/Layout.andO;The system is designed to support viewing up to 32 pages at a time, althoughthis hasn't been implemented yet.andM;Stories can be accessed from the story budget, listing their real orestimated length (depending on what information is available; see &quot;reporterterminal&quot; below), or space can be allocated to new stories.andP;  As they areassigned to an area, stories automatically-pick up the format associated withthat area as they are read in.andP;  The format includes spatial relationshipsbetween clements.andM;In the area of interactive pagination, Triple-I still seUs the PMS (the onewith the big green storage tube).andP;  But we saw the first stages of newdevelopments in the Page Preview that runs on a Sun workstation.andP;  The pagepreview has the software from the 3800 imagesetter Rip so it can build a pageat screen resolution.andP;  The target is to make it a full, interactive,page-finishing station by next year.andM;INSI unveils editorial systemandM;The show marked the first informal showing of the editorial system underdevelopment by Integrated Newspaper Systems International, the company thatwas formed two years ago as a joint venture between Ingersoll Publicationsand E.andP;  M.andP;  Warburg, Pincus andamp; Co.andP;  of New York.andP;  The editorial svstem isn'tready for installation yet, but it was far enough aling for the company todemonstrate some of its features in New Orleans.andM;As the company's name suggests, its philosophy is to offer an entireintegrated system from the same vendor, with all modules built to worktogether, including editorial, classified, circulation, production andbusiness programs (a total of 21 modules), all sharing the same database.andO;Part of its philosophy was to do everything exactly as it wanted, which hasmeant developing new editing and composition programs rather than using thoseavailable off the shelf.andM;The company.andP;  Although it was founded as a joint venture involving IngersollPublications, INSI functions completely independently.andP;  Soon after itsfounding, it acquired Creative Data Systems, a nine-year-old supplier ofnewspaper business systems.andP;  The acquisition was intended to provide INSIwith system expertise and a customer base, which then numbered more than 200.andO;INSI continues to support that customer base, although its future lies withits new system products.andM;Based in Overland Park, Kansas, INSI has a regional sales office in Atlantaand divides its sales effort into territories: the northeastern,southeastern, central and western portions of the country.andP;  Its staffcurrently numbers 90 people, about half of whom are involved in development.andM;The president is Christine Salter, who had joined Ingersol in 1985 fromoutside the newspaper industry.andP;  Ed Easley, formerly with System Integrators,serves as national director of sales and marketing.andP;  The company has threeproduct directors Ed Willis, production; Lee Dooley, financial; and FredPetty, advertising and circulation.andP;  INSI currently is looking for a generalmanager.andM;Operations are beginning in the U.S., but INSI plans to expand into Europe,and perhaps other areas, in the future.andP;  Hardware.andP;  The system is builtaround IBM AS/400 computers as central CPUs, configurable in pairs to providcredundant backup.andP;  For user workstations, INSI chose IBM PS/2s running underOS/2 and Presentation Manager, linked via Token Ring networks.andP;  The PS/2sneed a 40-MB disk drive and at least 3 MB of memory, with 5 MB recommended.andO;A mouse is supported but not required.andM;The software, written in high-level languages, was designed to be portable.andM;Editorial systcm.andP;  Some features of the editorial system are:andM;* File management.andP;  File security uses the facilities of the AS/ 400 plusprovisions for restricting access at ctshe user level to menu options,functions within options and editorial queues.andP;  (Much of this will bccontrolled by a &quot;user profile.&quot;) Story headers will be customizable, althoughthis wasn't demonstrated.andP;  Open files are saved automatically on the maindisk or on the local disk at user-specified intervals based on time or numberof keystrokes.andP;  Copy routing wiU be facilitated by functions such as -send tonext desk-.&quot;andM;Display.andP;  Monospaced display of text during writing and composition, withcommands displayable or supressable.andP;  User interface.andP;  Menus and windows(popup and pulldown) are supported for making selections, but function keysand keyboard shortcuts are available as alternatives.andP;  A set of &quot;userpreferences&quot; will customize certain aspects 'of operation for each user.andM;Editing features.andP;  Editing features look comprehensive-not unlike XyWrite intheir sophistication.andP;  However, they sometimes reix, on menus rather than acommand line.andP;  Basic cursor movement is supported, as is ease in defining andoperating on blocks.andP;  Entire words, sentences and paragraphs can be selectedby placing the cursor anywhere within the item.andP;  An undo function hasn't beenimplemented vet.andP;  Search/replace operations are complete, enabling wildcards,case sen-, sitivity or insensitivity, forward or backward searches, and theability to ignore embedded commands.andP;  The spelling checker, based on theProximity dictionary, can check die entire document or from the cursorlocation.andM;* Composition.andP;  Interactive handamp;j is provided during writing and editing, butit can be turned on or off as desired.andP;  Handamp;j'ed text shows acwal line endings,but not in WYSIWYG format.andP;  For justification, the program targets theoptimum word space in conjunction with preferential hyphenation points asspecified in the Proximity dictionary.andP;  Custom dictionaries will be availablefor handamp;j and spelling.andP;  The composition command set will be large, including afull set of indents (with skewing), mark and return to mark, kerning andtracking, etc..andP;  Formatting features are impressive.andP;  They supportconditional expressions (with the ability to branch to different formats),&quot;do while&quot; operations and chaining of formats.andP;  Background composition willbe provided later but wasn't demonstrated.andM;Advertising.andP;  INSI calls its classified program Tele-Ad to emphasize that ithandles all advertising, not only the classified section.andP;  It provides thesecurity offered by the AS/400, including logons and passwords, withautomatic credit checking, online handamp;j using the same program as the editorialsystem, calendar scheduling, etc.andP;  We didn't have time to look in detail atthe Tele-Ad program, but we hope to see it again closer to its formalrelease.andM;Ise market and the future.andP;  The INSI schedule calls for beta testing of theeditorial and tele-ad systems later this year and a general product releasein the first quarter of 1990, by, which time pricing will have beenannounced.andP;  As a marketing partner of IBM, INSI sells software only, nothardware.andM;Future development plans call for pagination and display, ad modules, whichwill be integrated with the rest of the system.andP;  None of this wasdemonstrated; tentative release dates haven't been announced.andM;How will the svstem fare in the market? We are impressed by the thoroughnessof the efforts so far.andP;  A lot of good ideas have been incorporated into thesystem as demonstrated in New Orleans, including an extremely flexible,customizable foundation.andP;  It also is based on a philosophy-fully, integratedsvstems-that will appeal to many newspapers.andP;  Tge use of PS/ is or IBM clonesas workstations should be attractive to most newspapers also.andP;  And the AS/400should provide thc resources for proper handling of database aspects of thesvstem.andM;That doesn't mean that the final product will be successful.andP;  We have seenmany systems look impressive in carly showings, only to fail for reasons notapparent in carly stages.andM;If we had been designing a system over the last couple of years, we probablywould have started with XyWrite, raher than develop our own editing program.andO;But that is because XyWrite is well known and it works weU-not because it isperfect.andP;  If INSI can improve substantially on XyWrite, it may prove that&quot;building a better mousetrap&quot; was indeed worth the extra effort and extratime.andP;  At least, the INSI editing program should blend weU into the rest ofdie system.andM;INSI says its target market is the entire spectrum of newspapers, large andsmall.andP;  Although pricing hasn't been announced, it is obvious that, based onthe hardware and the sophistication of the system, INSI won't compete withthe low-end vendors.andP;  It has a long way to go to catch up to CText, Dewar and'Some of the other vendors now competing head-on in the mid-range market.andP;  Itis a long and tough challenge, but the system is being built on some goodideas.andP;  If INSI can meet its target of shipping the basic system early in1990, it may have a chance.andM;SCS adds to Quark interfaceandM;Software Consulting Services (SCS), the creator of Layout8000, demonstratedthe latest version of its pagination system SCS/Linx.andP;  Programmed as anextension of Quark Xpress, it supports input from a variety of editorial andad layout systems.andP;  In fact, one of its strongest points is its apparentability to cope with the multivendor (software and hardware) environment thatexists in many newspapers.andM;In our review of exhibits at the Seybold Seminars in March (see Vol.andP;  18, No.andO;13, p.andP;  30), we described the basic procedures for taking information fromLayout-8000 ad dummies and using it to set up Xpress as a pagination tool.andO;This process uses a special menu added to Xpress by SCS.andP;  After the pagegeometries have been defined in this way, die layout operator can import copyfrom SCS-8000 or from other editorial systems.andM;The newest addition to functionality is that the user now has a choice ofmaintaining the composition of the original editorial system or choosing touse Quark Xpress to handamp;j and compose the text.andP;  Of course, if any changes areto be made to text that require new handamp;j, that would have to be done byXpress.andM;Completed ads are associated with the appropriate page holes.andP;  Ads may becreated by Digital Technology's AdSpeed or by the new Multi-Ad Creatorprogram from Multi-Ad Services, which, we were told, has impressed many oftheSCS/Linx customers.andM;Ads also may, be created using standard Mac programs like Illustrator,MacDraw or Xpress itself All the ads must be converted to EPS files; SCSprovides the tools for making this conversion.andP;  Then the file path name mustbe specified to associate a specific EPS file with a specific ad.andM;Another change since we last saw the SCS/Linx is the ability to use moreinformation provided by the front-end system, such as to have Quarkautomatically pull the date from the front end.andP;  Also improved is the speedof accessing ads.andP;  Xpress now reads all thc ads for a page at one time,rather than one by one.andP;  If it can't find one, it looks for it.andM;An addition to the functionality is the ability to save page templates asQuark templates.andM;SCS hasn't yet implemented a story budget for use in planning pages, but itsays it is studying the needs of its customers to determine how to do it.andO;Also to be added later is a vertical justification feature in which the usercan select which columns arc to be spaced out vertically and to specify inpercentage terms how the extra space will be divided between inter-line andinter-paragraph modifications.andM;Again, while ultimately the layout tools are those of the current version ofQuark Xpress (with all that program's virtues and deficits), the connectivityand flexibility of the systcm is most impressive.andP;  Aside from the softwarementioned above, SCS pilot sites are using Crosfield/Hastech and Atexeditorial systems, the SII classified ad system and the Admarc order entryprogram.andP;  Files are being delivered over networks that have Sun, DEC or IBMmainframes.andP;  This capability of responding to the real-world grab-bag ofsystems and programs is the strong point of a capable (if unspectacular)pagination system.andM;Pricing for SCS/Linx is $2,750, which includes Xpress and the Xtensions.andM;SII/Digital Technology deal causes stirandM;The big news in the System Integrators booth centered on its deal withDigital Technology, rather than the SII equipment itself (see Vol.andP;  18.andP;  No.andO;17 for our coverage of this deal.andP;  We ran into representatives of severallarge newspapers, all of whom were prospective customers, who were eager toget a combination SII/DTI system.andP;  At first we thought this meant an SIIsystem for the database and editorial applications, with DTI supplying the admake-up software.andP;  But several papers were encouraging SII to go a stepfurther by building a complete configuration based on Digital Technology'sMac-based editorial terminals.andP;  We left the show without any firm commitmentbv either SII or DTI to what type of configuration might come out of thiscustomer pressure (Macs tied to Tandems?).andP;  But since the pressure was comingfrom at least four prominent large metros, we are sure both DTI and SII arelistening..andM;Digital Technology's system.andP;  DTI also brought interesting developments forwriters and editors.andP;  A close integration between its Mac-based editorialproduct and its PageSpeed pagination system has created a new focus onminimizing the copyfitting task for editors.andP;  DTI's goal is to reducecopyfitting by allowing editors to write and edit copy to &quot;approximate&quot; fitspecifications, rather than the currently lengthy process of &quot;exact fit&quot;editors are trimming stories to now.andM;All of this is coupled with a code-free environment.andP;  DTI accomplishes thisby the use of tags, similar to those used bv in-plant document suppliers.andO;Different tags are used for body copy, headlines, lead-ins, pulled quotes,etc.andP;  The user simply tags each story element and applies a style or format.andO;Each style contains typographic parameters for each tagged element.andM;Although Digital Technology has been selling systems is mostly to small andmedium papers, we talked to several larger papers that were excited about theprospect of using the codeless environment.andP;  Part of the attraction was alsothe prospect of using a Mac as an editing tool.andP;  The company also has triedto make this approach attractive to keyboard/cursor advocates by making theuse of the mouse almost completely optional, duplicating most of the commonediting functionality direcdy on the keyboard.andM;Copyfitting.andP;  The reduction in copyfitting time comes from a combination ofthe editorial system and its pagination philosophy.andP;  Using the Mac-basededitorial system, editors write and edit stories to approximate fit only.andO;Depending on die size of the story, getting story lengths to within six orseven lines is usually sufficient.andP;  There is no need to copyfit to the exactline count; the aim is to reduce the last-minute editing to die precise linecount.andM;When the story reaches the pagination process, it is condensed or expandedaccording to tables of typographic parameters, with limits specified by theuser.andP;  The stories are automatically fit to the news hole by adjusting thestory via the following parameters: (1) character spacing; (2) word spacing;(3) set width; (4) kerning (pairs); (5) interparagraph spacing.andM;These parameters are adjusted in the order listed and within the limitsspecified by the user.andP;  When die limit in one categot), is reached, the nextadjustment parameter is invoked.andP;  This is repeated until the story fits thespecified page layout news hole.andM;Digital Technology experimented with several different parameters.andP;  Pointsize and leading parameters were found to have too dramatic effect on thestory's appearance.andP;  The five parameters they have chosen are optional, butthey are effective in adjusting copy fit while minimizing the typographicconsequences.andM;This reminds us of some of the automatic algorithms for paginating books,where widows and orphans must be avoided and the depths of facing pages haveto be balanced.andP;  It sounds like a very interesting possibility for reducingthe burden on newspaper editors, just as it is for book production staff (Whymake people do what a computer can do  instead?)andM;One thing the Digital Technology routine doesn't offer that would be a niceenhancement is to enable partial amounts of each type of adjustment to bemade in combination to minimize the effect of a great change to any oneparameter.andP;  For example, smaller changes in character and word spacing wouldbe less noticeable than a large adjustment in character spacing and no changein word spacing.andP;  We also wonder why kerning would ever be turned off orotherwise modified to aid in copyfitting when uniform spacing adjustments arealready programmed into the algorithm in the first item.andM;Directtons appear.andP;  As we mentioned above, several larger papers showedinterest in the Digital Technology system.andP;  With the SII connection, twoquestions kept coming up: Who is the supplier? What is the database? It lookslike the answers to both are pretty firm now.andM;SII will integrate the Macs with the CLX Tandem processors for one high-endsystem.andP;  The only other platform anticipated now is a '386 file serversystem.andP;  DTI will offer this with a new version of Novell's Netware ('386)and an Oracle SQL database.andP;  DTI feels that the speed and performanceimprovements of the '386 and the network control software from Novell willsoon come up to the performance standards in the range of the CLX processors.andM;It doesn't look as if there is any room for another platform in between.andM;Coyote PC.andP;  SII also showed its Coyote PC, which was covered in our IFRAreview last November.andP;  For this stage of iis conversion to PCs, SII put theintelligence of the Coyote terminal on an add-in PC card.andP;  With the cardinstalled in a standard PC, the PC functions like a standard Coyote terminal.andO;This is step one in SII's move to the PCs.andM;Since last fall, SII has made one significant improvement.andP;  The softwareallows the Coyote to transfer its files in MS-DOS format and visa versa.andO;This means that users can now, for the first time, take files written andedited using the Coyote software and store them on the floppy disk of the PCor any device using the standard DOS format.andM;SII has taken this one step further in demonstrating a prototype of DOS-basedCoyote software that's a subset of Coyote functionality.andP;  Most of thestandard editing function are included in die terminal.andP;  What the usercurrently doesn't get in the PC version is soft keys, UDKs and SDKs (user-and system-definable keys) and split-screen operation.andP;  For now, this becomesSII's &quot;poor man's&quot; Coyote system, It may be the wise man's product as well.andM;Interactive News Layout.andP;  SII also brought its INL (Interactive News Layout)product, introduced at IFRA last year, which displayed a significant numberof improvements.andP;  It is now tightly integrated with its Space Reservation andIAL product.andP;  SII's space reservation software sets up the size of thenewspaper and assigns space for each section, department, etc.andP;  Its IAL(Interactive Advertising Layout) software dummies ads onto pages in much thesame way as the Layout-8000 package.andP;  This product has been around for sometime and has always had very rough edges--especially in regards to its userinterface.andP;  The ANPA version was a significant improvement in this area.andM;IAL is a rule-based program that dummies all the display ads for an edition.andO;It provides a much-improved user override to change ad placement manually.andO;When the uscr is satisfied with the way ads are placed for an entire edition,the ad stacks are frozen and the results are passed to the INL .andP;  IAL and INLare now completely integrated.andP;  However, IAL is still running under Ring (notDOS) in a '386 workstation.andM;The plans call for moving IAL into a Macintosh for die final product, sincethis is more closely tied to the advertising side of the business; the newDigital Technology agreement brings Macs into the picture as the ad make-upterminals.andM;INL, which is primarily a news-oriented product, will remain on a '386workstation and will run under OS/2.andP;  SII and DTI are demonstrating that theycan store an EPS version of die DTI display ads so that these ads can bedisplayed on the INL (or Coyote) terminals in a soft-preview presentation.andM;Graphics.andP;  Although the total integration with the DTI package is notcomplete at this time, we were able to get a better picture of how SII andDTI plan to put their product together.andP;  One key area of concern is thegraphics portion of ads (and editorial graphics).andP;  SII plans to input scannedgraphics from both the Autokon camera and the DPS Typecraft SpeedScanner.andO;The DPS graphics will be controlled by a Mac that will act as the interfaceto the Tandems.andP;  Both inputs wiU be sent to the Tandems for storage and datamanagement under SII's new graphics database.andM;The DPS graphics will be compressed before they are sent to the Tandems.andP;  TheAutokon files will be compressed as they enter the Tandems.andP;  AH graphics willbe stored in their highresolution format in compressed form.andP;  The Tandemswill create view files to be used both by the DTI ad make-up terminals tiedto the Tandems and by the SII INL terminals.andP;  Instructions for cropping,sizing and rotating from either terminal will be sent to the Tandems, wherethe operations on the high-resolution data will be carried out before it isoutput to typesetters as PostScript files.andM;There are also some alternative integration plans between DTI and SIIregarding ads.andP;  DTI has its own dummying scheme that currently has theability to output full ad stacks (and is doing so at several of its newspapersites).andP;  The ad stacks will be sent to the Tandems for inclusion on INLpages.andP;  The hope is that die raw text of the ads will be provided to theTandems in AdSpeed's internal data structure format, allowing die ads, to beeditable on the Tandem side.andP;  The ads may look like one big TIFF file withinan EPS envelope.andM;What exists today? Currently, the DTI Mac terminals are connected to theTandems and can use the Tandems to supply raw text for ad building on theMacs.andP;  Completed ads in EPS format can be stored on the Tandems, and thestandard Tandem database routines for file management, purging, etc.andP;  may beapplied to thc raw text and composed ads.andP;  The automatic correlation ofgraphics to ads, killing only ad-specific graphics when ads are purged, andfull control of ad jackets and aU graphics arc planned for the next phase ofdevelopment.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
