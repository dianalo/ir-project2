(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Mary Ann Gerlach remembers the approach ofHurricane Camille on Aug. 17, 1969, was little more than an excusefor a party at her Mississippi Gulf Coast apartment complex.   After all, she had ridden out hurricanes before and ``a hurricaneparty was a good time to drink and play cards under the hurricanelamps.''   But within hours the storm's screaming 200 mph winds and wall ofwater claimed her husband and the two dozen people who had gatheredon the third floor of the apartment complex for the party Gerlachorganized.   There were many stories of personal tragedy in Camille, includingJacqueline Hines, who spent that night 20 years ago with her latehusband clinging for life 30 feet up their television tower inGulfport as giant waves reduced their home to rubble.   Gerlach said long hours at work before the storm saved her life.   ``I had worked the night before so we decided to take a nap inour second-floor apartment and join the party on the third floorlater. Not going up to that party is why I'm alive today.''   Within hours, Camille's strengthening wind had blown out theirapartment's windows and water from the nearby Mississippi Sound hadreached waist deep in their bedroom.   ``We looked up at our ceiling and there were cracks in the walls,you knew the third floor was fixing to come down right on top ofus,'' she said. ``We swam out of the window and I immediately gottangled up in telephone lines.''   Gerlach said once she had freed herself, she fought to swim away.   ``It was during that time I heard my husband hollering, `MaryAnn, Mary Ann,' and then I didn't hear his voice any more. I knew hehad drowned but the shock didn't register,'' she said.   As she grabbed onto debris and fought to keep her head abovewater ``I looked back and I could see the apartment house. It juststarted sliding down into the water,'' she said. ``I will neverforget seeing the hurricane lamps as they were still lit anddisappearing under the water. I knew all those people inside weregone.''   Gerlach was rescued the next morning on a pile of debris. Herhusband's body was found in a tree-top 11 days later. Gerlach is nowserving a life sentence for murdering a later husband.   Hines, now 79, had experienced several hurricanes during her 51years living along the coast. She rode out a major storm in 1947 and``I just didn't believe Camille could be any worse than that one.''   Despite warnings from friends, the couple decided to stay toprotect their home. Within a few hours it was too late to leave.   Water eventually poured into their home and they were sweptoutside. They clung to their 60-foot television tower, inchinghigher as waves broke over their heads.   ``All around it looked like we were in mid-ocean _ the wind wasso strong I couldn't hold my head up,'' Hines said.   The tower finally broke off, sending the couple into the waterand knocking her husband unconscious. She managed to pull him to theroof of their house, ``which was floating like a barge at the backof our property.''   Hours later, the two were rescued and both were hospitalized forbroken ribs and other injuries.   ``The first Sunday Leon was out of the hospital he went to hisSunday school class at the First Methodist Church in Gulfport, andthe class sang the hymn `Lord Plant My Feet on Higher Ground' anddedicated it to him.''</TEXT></DOC>
