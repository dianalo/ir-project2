Its purpose is to improvethe operations of the Special Programs for Students from DisadvantagedBackgrounds (Student Support Services, Upward Bound, Talent Search, EducationalOpportunity Centers, and the Ronald E. McNair Post-Baccalaureate AchievementProgram) by providing project staff and leadership personnel with trainingin carrying out project activities. On June 23, 1988 the Secretary published a notice of proposed rulemakingfor the Training Program for Special Programs Staff and Leadership Personnelin the <T4>Federal Register</T4> (53 FR 23724). The Secretary amends the regulations to conform to the statute as amendedby the Higher Education Amendments of 1986 and makes other changes to improvethe administration of the program. There are no differences between theNPRM and these final regulations. <ITAG tagnum="84">Analysis of Comments and Changes </ITAG>In response to the Secretary's invitation in the NPRM, nine parties submittedcomments on the proposed regulations. An analysis of the comments follows.Substantive issues are discussed under the section of the regulations towhich they pertain. Technical and other minor changes_and suggested changesthat the Secretary is not legally authorized to make under the applicablestatutory authority_are not addressed. andSection;642.6 What is the allowable number of applications? <T3>Comments: </T3>Seven commenters suggested that andSection;642.6, limitingthe number of an applicant's applications, be deleted because it imposesan unnecessary restriction which reduces competition. Several commenterssuggested that the provision prevents an applicant from focusing on specialpopulation groups within a priority which would be better served by separategrants. <T3>Discussion: </T3>The Secretary has retained andSection;642.6 of the regulationsfor two reasons: (1) The submission of one application for each prioritydoes not limit the number of trainees or the target area an applicant maypropose for each priority since in addressing the selection criteria forproject participants, an applicant may include various groups of peoplefrom different backgrounds with similar needs under one priority; and (2)The Secretary believes that to improve the administration of the grantsit is best to limit the applicant to one application for each priorityor topic. This change will afford more high ranking applicants an opportunityto be funded and alleviate the expense of processing several applicationssubmitted by one applicant who proposes to provide identical services todifferent target populations. Thus, the competitiveness is increased andthe administrative burden and cost of administering the program is reduced.andSection;642.34 Priorities for funding <T3>Comments: </T3>Nine comments suggested that andSection;642.34(a), establishingpotential subjects of training priorities, be deleted because the State,Regional and National Associations for Special Programs did not have anopportunity to provide input and the proposed priorities listed limit andexclude topics for which the associations have expressed a need for training.<T3>Discussion: </T3>The proposed prorities listed in andSection;642.34(a)are based on training needs documented by the Department from previouslysolicited public comments. These include comments of persons from regional,State, and national professional associations having special knowledgewith respect to the training needs of Special Programs personnel. Additionally,andSection;642.34(a) of the regulations states that the Secretary will consultwith regional and State professional associations prior to selecting oneor more of the subjects listed as potential training priorities. In addition,andSection;642.34(b) of the regulations enables applicants to submit proposalsfor any topic that addresses a significant training need. Changes: None <ITAG tagnum="84">Executive Order 12291</ITAG>These regulations have been reviewed in accordance with Executive Order12291. They are not classified as major because they do not meet the criteriafor major regulations established in the order.<ITAG tagnum="84">Assessment of Educational Impact</ITAG>In the notice of proposed rulemaking, the Secretary requested commentson whether the proposed regulations would require transmission of informationthat is already being gathered by or is available from any other agencyor authority of the United States. Based on the response to the proposed rules and on its own review, theDepartment has determined that the regulations in this document do notrequire transmission of information that is being gathered by or is availablefrom any other agency or authority of the United States.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 34 CFR Part 642</ITAG>Education, Education of disadvantaged, Education of handicapped, Grantsprograms, Training.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: February 2, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Lauro F.
