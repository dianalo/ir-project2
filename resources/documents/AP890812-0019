It was the first Soviet government comment on the parliamentarymaneuvering in which Solidarity is trying to form a non-Communistgovernment to lead the Soviet Union's largest East bloc ally.   The independent Solidarity trade union movement staged thestrike in Gdansk province to demand more pay and an end toCommunist Party influence on management.   Soviet Ambassador Vladimir Brovikov held an unusual series ofmeetings in Warsaw on Friday, including sessions with the chairmenof the United Peasant Party and the Democratic Party. The partiestraditionally have been allied with the Communists, but Solidarityis courting them to form a government.   According to the Polish government's PAP news agency, the partyleaders and the Soviet ambassador met to discuss starting ``directcooperation'' with the Soviet Communist Party and to review reformsin both countries.   PAP said Brovikov met also with Prime Minister Gen. CzeslawKiszczak, who is trying to assemble a Communist-dominated Cabinet.   Since neither Solidarity nor the Communists have a majority inparliament, support from the Peasants and Democrats is crucial forboth sides' efforts to form a government.   A Soviet official in Moscow, quoted by the official Tass newsagency, hinted that Solidarity's attempts to shut the Communistsout of a coalition government could hurt stability in Europe.   The unidentified official did not mention Solidarity by name butcriticized ``attempts to use the process of forming the Polishgovernment for destabilizing the situation in the country.''   Vadim Perfiliev, Soviet Foreign Ministry first deputy, wasquoted as telling a news conference that any acts that threatenPoland's treaty obligations, ``including those under the WarsawTreaty and on Soviet-Polish cooperation, would not promote theinterests of stability in Europe.''   Forming a new government was Poland's affair, Perfiliev said,but added that the hoped a ``balanced approach'' would prevail,according to Tass.   The general strike in Gdansk province by bus drivers,shipbuilders, dockhands and factory workers was Solidarity's firstsince regaining legal status in April. Bogdan Borusewicz, anorganizer, described it as ``exceptionally'' successful.   Solidarity said more than 200,000 workers participated and manysigned up to join the union, which has grown slowly sincelegalization.   ``Even those enterprises where Solidarity is weak went onstrike,'' Borusewicz said.   Solidarity's regional council for Gdansk province estimated morethan 90 percent of the 500 enterprises in which it had members tookpart in the strike.   Organizers said it encompassed Gdansk, Sopot and Gdynia alongthe Baltic Coast and inland towns. The province has 1.5 millionpeople.   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa, addressing workers in Gdynia,referred to parliament's election of Kiszczak as prime ministerAug. 2, and said: ``Let's not allow the monopoly of generals to bereborn.''   The opposition newspaper Gazeta Wyborcza said reports werecirculating that the opposition was proposing Walesa for primeminister. Barbara Madajczyk-Krasowska, a Solidarity spokeswoman,said Walesa made no comment on that report Friday.   The strike, announced by wailing sirens and whistles at noon,idled the Northern and Repair shipyards in Gdansk, the ParisCommune shipyard in Gdynia and all ports in both cities, Solidaritysaid.   Buses and streetcars stopped running, and factories displayedbanners to show they were participating.   Solidarity's birthplace, the Lenin Shipyard, supported thedemands but did not strike. Workers said they did not want to riskupsetting a tentative deal under which American philanthropistBarbara Piasecka-Johnson would invest in the state-owned yard tosave it from bankruptcy.   The official trade union federation OPZZ said its unionsapproved of Solidarity's economic demands and it supported theprotest.</TEXT></DOC>
