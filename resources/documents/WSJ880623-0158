But supporters acknowleged they lack the votes to override President Reagan's certain veto.    Testifying before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Deputy Secretary of State John C. Whitehead opposed the sanctions measure against the apartheid government as counterproductive.    Senators employed strong language in stating their positions, with North Carolina Republican Jesse Helms, a leading opponent, accusing California Democrat Alan Cranston, a strong supporter, of crippling South African blacks, &quot;starving them to death, knocking them out of jobs.&quot;    Sen. Helms introduced a competing bill to repeal the Anti-Apartheid Act of 1986, which imposed a set of less severe sanctions against South Africa.    That measure survived a Reagan veto two years ago, 84-14.    Sen. Lowell Weicker (R., Conn.) joined Sen. Paul Simon (D., Ill.) in saying the 1986 sanctions haven't been effective in promoting reform in South Africa because the Reagan administration dragged its feet in implementing them.    But Sen. Simon said: &quot;Candidly, right now, I don't think we have the votes to override a veto.&quot;    He said passage of the trade embargo bill would send a strong message to South Africa that the U.S. is serious in seeking an end to that country's system of apartheid, or racial separation.    The measure calls for the total removal of all U.S. corporations and businesses from South Africa and for the end of twoway trade except for U.S. imports of certain strategic minerals. </TEXT></DOC>
