Hardly: It is anintegral part of the elan or esprit de corps of contemporary Appledom.andM;But corporate Apple does seem to have realized that it can benefit from thefront-line experience of the thousands of Mac programmers and engineersoutside the company.andM;As a consequence, the plan for System 7.0 is responsive to the real needs ofreal developers.andP;  This is unlike many previous releases, which were designedin invory-tower isolation or only to meet the needs of Apple's own products.andM;Beyond the sexiest of the enhancements, such as virtual memory,interapplication communication and outline fonts, there are dozens of smallerchanges that provide features for which developers have been begging -- orscreaming.andM;Many of these are features that Apple itself has used internally but thatoutside developers could not duplicate in a portable, documented way.andM;One of the most obvious is the floating &quot;windoid&quot; hack used by HyperCard.andO;Other hacks that will be made kosher include changing Finder comments,sublaunching, external file systems, automatic background applications andperformance monitoringandM;These changes also include standard, supported mechanisms to replacetechniques that previously had to be written by each developer, such astear-off menus, kerning, ligatures, playing disk-based sounds and real-timemultimedia, not to mention printer and communication drivers.andM;Overall, I was impressed by Apple's decision to support all machines down tothe Mac Plus, with only virtual memory and the color-related enhancementsunavailable on the 68000-based CPUs.andP;  Unfortunately, the 2-Mbyte minimummeans that developers will have to support both 6.0 and 7.0 for some years tocome.andM;Personally, I was disappointed that Apple isn't moving more aggressivelytoward an object-oriented toolbox.andP;  But the tools aren't quite ready andneither is the developer community, so I guess I can take solace in theofficial sanction of C++ as Apple's internal language of choice, as evidencedby its use in rewriting the Finder.andM;(1 was also disappointed to learn at the last minute of Apple's policy ofrequiring non-disclosure agreements from developers who are also members ofthe press.andP;  Forced to choose, I decided it was preferable to leave so I couldwrite whatever I wanted about System 7.0 in this column and elsewhere.)andM;Response to developer questions indicated that Apple is working on additionalkey features, but their announcement is being withheld until Apple is 100percent sure it can deliver by the due date.andP;  So if the &quot;core&quot; (mandatory)features run a little late, there will be time to slip in a few more goodies.andM;In gauging developer reaction, remember that most developers are specialists,concerned with one narrow area like fast screen bliting or low-level diskdrivers.andP;  Apple's specialists are responding to each of these narrower goals,guided by a few generalists who are trying to make sure that the pieces fittogether as a coherent whole.andM;With the plan now established, what remains is, of course, execution.andP;  Canthese features be delivered on time?andP;  Will they be as good as they are sound?andO;As the TV correspondents say, the answer remains to be seen.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
