The group Monday issued a report calling for coordinated planningto prepare coastal defenses against floods, stop deforestation,re-examine energy policies, cooperate to monitor and studyemissions, and to carry out the accord to halt the depletion of theozone layer recently signed in Montreal.   The report said weather changes will make deserts hotter andtropical storms more severe in the next few decades. It said risingseas will threaten to flood coastal cities like New York andendanger entire countries like the Netherlands and Bangladesh.   Bolin said the scientists could not establish how the weatherchanges would hit specific areas, but it was clear that ``climaticproblems will be part of people's lives over the next century.''   The study was a follow-up to a 1985 conference of theInternational Council of Scientific Unions at Villach, Austria,which endorsed the theory that gases trap energy from the sun nearthe Earth's surface, warming the atmosphere in a ``greenhouseeffect.''   ``We are entering a new phase. We told the world what scientistsbelieve will be the case ... Now nations and politicians must startto think about the problems,'' said Bolin, whose pioneering work onthe greenhouse effect and the ozone layer earned him this year's$150,000 Tyler Prize for Environmental Achievement from theUniversity of Southern California.   The report said the earth's average temperature will rise by atleast 0.54 to 1.44 degrees Fahrenheit per decade. In the tropics andin the polar regions, the rise in temperature may reach as much as 9degrees, the report said.   The rising temperatures will melt polar ice packs in summer,raising the sea level by 8 to 60 inches over the next 50 years, thereport said.   At least 30 of the world's largest cities ``definitely will beaffected,'' said Jill Jaeger of the Beijer Institute of the RoyalInstitute of the Academy of Sciences, who wrote the report.   In the last 100 years the earth's average temperature has risennine-tenths of a degree and sea level has risen by four to 4.8inches, she said.   Even if emissions of dangerous gases were stopped immediately,temperatures and the sea level would continue to rise at that ratefor another 100 years because of those gases already released in theatmosphere, she said.   The report said that among the effects, tropical storms willbecome more frequent and hit wider areas. Patterns of rainfall, andthus farming, will change. Fish migrations will shift. Evaporationwill increase, making water supplies scarcer in semi-arid zones.Trees and animals may have difficulty reproducing and may bethreatened with extinction.   Jaeger said more powerful storms could cause severe flooding inBangladesh, threating the lives or dislocation of 50 million people.Floods could overwhelm the Nile Basin, where 10 million Egyptianslive.   ``Roughly half of humanity lives close to the sea,'' she said.The United States alone will have to spend up to $100 billion toprotect its eastern seaboard, she said.   The changing climate also will have military implications as seasbecome ice-free along the northern coasts of Europe, North Americaand Siberia.   ``If these coastlines become navigable, fundamental securityreadjustments will be required,'' the report said.   The report listed the ``greenhouse gases'' as carbon dioxide,methane, chlorofluorocarbons, nitrous oxide and tropospheric ozone.</TEXT></DOC>
