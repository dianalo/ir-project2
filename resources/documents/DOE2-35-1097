<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-35-1097 </DOCNO><TEXT>The formal licensing process of NPPs has been based, in the nuclear communitygenerally, on deterministic rules and criteria, related to specific accidents,single failures, diversity and redundancy. The evolution of the probabilisticsafety assessment (PSA) had only a slight impact on the organizationof the licensing process until the accident of Three Mile Island (TMI)when the PSA was understood only as a supporting tool for the deterministicprocess without a life of its own. However, the time after the TMI accidenthas meant a significant development and progress as concerns the utilizationof the PSA methodology in the licensing and regulation of NPPs. Now afterthe accident in Chernobyl, several countries are considering the useof the probabilistic approach as an essential part of the licensing process.Besides, an extensive international interest is also focused on the questionof probabilistic safety criteria (PSC). Various PSC approaches have beendeveloped and proposed, including objectives or limits for individualor societal risks, plant level criteria for core melt and performanceof safety functions and systems, as well as principles for using cost-benefitbased criteria. Because of the different national conditions, objectivesand opinions, it is foreseen that the time is not yet ripe for establishingcommon international standards on PSC. However, in spite of differentpreferences and approaches to PSC, it is felt that the extensive interestin safety criteria will serve as a tool to defend the plants against,or mitigate, the possible severe NPP accidents. In the paper, fundamentalsof deterministic analyses and PSAs are presented, ample references tothe national practices are made and an outlook on the near term applicationsof probabilistic and deterministic safety assessment is given.
