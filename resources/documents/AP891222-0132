His severity earned him the nickname ``Draculescu,'' for BramStoker's bloodthirsty count of Transylvania.   Absolute power and the cult were his twin props as he pursuednationalist policies, strayed from the Soviet line in foreigndealings and ultimately deprived his oppressed people of evenlife's basic necessities.   He invested billions of dollars in a crash industrializationprogram and rigidly followed a policy of domestic austerity to payoff Romania's entire foreign debt of $11 billion.   Food and energy shortages were pervasive. Despair spread amongthe nation's 23 million people as hardships became more severethrough the 1980s, and in the end not even the ubiquitous secretpolice or the army could keep them down.   As his 24 years of autocratic rule ground along, increasingopposition arose to Ceausescu, the customary star of the daily twohours of Romanian television, and his crackdowns on dissent grewharsher.   About 30,000 coal miners in the Jiu Valley struck in 1977.   A decade later, in Brasov, at least 10,000 workers demonstrated,demanding freedom, better living conditions and Ceasuescu'sdismissal. Police arrested hundreds of the protesters and theirleaders disappeared in mysterious circumstances.   On Dec. 17, his security forces opened fire on thousands ofdemonstrators in Timisoara who demanded freedom and a better life,beginning the chain of events that brought him down. Reportsindicated thousands of unarmed civilians may have been killed inthe Transylvanian city.   As democratic reform spread through the Soviet bloc, Ceausescu,71, stuck to rigid Communist orthodoxy.   ``The triumph of the revolution requires unity, severediscipline and a spirit of sacrifice,'' he told a Bucharest massmeeting this year. ``A firm organization is needed, as well as atested political leader who knows how to unite and lead themasses.''   His ``firm organization'' was the Romanian Communist Party,which he had turned into a personal instrument since taking over in1965, and a vast network of security forces.   He had gradually pushed aside all leaders who opposed hispolicies and installed loyalists on the ruling 23-member Politburo.They included his wife, Elena, who became the second most powerfulperson in Romania.   Ceausescu began building his personality cult in earnest after1974, when he made himself the first president in Romania's history.   His pictures and sayings lined the streets of Bucharest andother cities Bookstores were filled with works attributed to him.   When he became president in March 1974, an official pictureshowed him holding a silver scepter as the symbol of authority. Thepropaganda line was the ``golden era'' of Ceausescu, even when thecountry that had been known as Europe's breadbasket became one ofits poorest.   Secret police kept a strict rein on religion and politicalexpression. Ceausescu said Warsaw Pact allies that pursued reformwere abandoning communism, and Romania became isolated in the Eastas well as the West.   The United States and other Western powers originally hadencouraged Ceausescu's relatively independent stand within theSoviet bloc. Two U.S. presidents visited Bucharest: Richard M.Nixon in 1969 and Gerald R. Ford in 1975.   Britain made him an honorary knight and Norway gave Ceausescuand his wife the honorary Grand Cross of St. Olav. The awards werewithdrawn Friday.   Ceausescu continued diplomatic relations with Israel when therest of the Soviet bloc broke them in in 1967. He denounced theSoviet-led invasion that crushed Czecholsovakia's reforms of 1968.   His was the only East bloc country to send athletes to the 1984Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, breaking the Soviet boycott.   He also looked to the West commercially and the United Stateswas for a time Romania's biggest Western trade partner, largelybecause it granted Most Favored Nation trading status.   Criticism of Ceausescu's human rights abuses grew, however, andrelations with the West deteriorated.   At home, Ceausescu exhorted Romanians to work hard, and imposeda six-day work week on nearly everybody despite shortages of food,medicine and heat in winter.   ``He was worse than Hitler, who, for all his crimes, at leastsincerely wished the welfare of Germany,'' said Mircea Stoica, alaw professor at Bucharest University who fled to Hungary.``Ceausescu hates his people, and his wife Elena has often referredto Romanians as `worms.'''   He also took care of his family. Mrs. Ceausescu was vice premierand their son, Nicu, was a regional party chief. Valentin, anadopted son; Zoia-Elena, their daughter; and Ceausescu brothersMarin, Ilie, Ion and Nicolae Andruta were given important jobs, aswere several in-laws.   Romanian and Western sources say about 40 relatives were in theparty and government state hierarchy.   Ceausescu was born Jan. 26, 1918, in Scornicesti, the third sonof a large peasant family. He did not finish elementary school andwas apprenticed as a shoemaker.   He later worked in a factory and joined the illegal Communistparty youth organization at age 15, becoming a full party memberthree years later in 1936.   Communist activities landed Ceausescu in jail several timesbefore and during World War II. He became a protege of CommunistParty chief Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej, rose quickly through the ranksand succeeded to the party leadership after Gheorghiu-Dej's death.</TEXT></DOC>
