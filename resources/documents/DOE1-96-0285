The reporting laboratoriesare those with a substantial program for the measurement of neutron andnuclear cross sections of relevance to the US applied nuclear energyprogram. Appropriate subjects are microscopic neutron cross sectionsrelevant to the nuclear energy program, including shielding. Inversereactions where pertinent are included; charged-particle cross sectionswhere relevant to developing and testing nuclear models; gamma ray production,radioactive decay, and theoretical developments in nuclear structurewhich are applicable to nuclear energy programs; and proton and alpha-particlecross sections, at energies of up to 1 GeV, which are of interest tothe space program.</TEXT></DOC>
