By serving raw fish, including ceviche, Peru's nationaldish, Mr. Fujimori was saying: Ignore those warnings (fromhis own health minister) to avoid raw fish because of theepidemic of cholera, which spreads through contaminated foodand water.</LP><TEXT>   The culinary demonstration in aid of Peru's beleagueredfishing industry was typical of the mixture of courage andrecklessness Mr. Fujimori has displayed since he won thepresidency last year, defeating famed novelist Mario VargasLlosa. The ceviche war, as the battle became known here, alsois a new sign of the confusion that has marked his tenure.&quot;There's enormous confusion over where we're heading and withwhat institutions,&quot; says economist Roberto Abusada.   The public squabble with his health minister is the latestof a series of fights Mr. Fujimori has picked. His first actas president was to fire the commanders of the navy and airforce. He has called some judges &quot;jackals.&quot; He attacked theRoman Catholic Church for being &quot;medieval and recalcitrant&quot;on birth control. He's induced several ministers, includingthe health minister and Prime Minister Juan Carlos HurtadoMiller, to quit. Recently, Mr. Fujimori had a public spatwith his top adviser, Hernando de Soto, whose contacts inWashington are viewed here as essential in helping Peru sortout its mess.   The moves, many say, are sapping Mr. Fujimori's base ofsupport outside the army just as he faces a daunting set ofproblems: a deep recession following the so-called Fujishockhe enforced to bring inflation down from 7,650% in 1990;escalating terrorism and political violence that claimed3,384 lives last year; growing production of coca leaf, thebase material of cocaine; and now the cholera epidemic thathas made thousands sick, killed hundreds and could deprivePeru of $200 million in exports and tourism revenue.   &quot;You can't help but note the swiftness of thedeterioration of his government,&quot; says journalist and authorGustavo Gorriti. &quot;At first, he made all the right decisions:He started a new dialogue with international lendinginstitutions and played a talented diplomatic game with theU.S. on the narcotics front. But then, in a string of baddecisions that he believed to be the epitome of machiavelliantalent, he's taken all his power base away.&quot;   In an interview in his office, Mr. Fujimori defends hisconfrontational style as necessary as he tries to take onentrenched positions and privileges. He also admits thatachievements in his first few months have been slim, butsays: &quot;We're trying to correct the chaos. We won't make greatchanges at once, but in a gradual manner. We'll slowly butsurely overcome the great problems of this country:terrorism, narco-trafficking and the economic crisis.&quot;   Mr. Fujimori says all three problems are inextricablylinked, but improving the economy is the first key torestoring stability. There have been modest signs of success:Inflation, 397% for August alone following the Fujishock --which included price increases of up to 3,000% -- is expectedto fall below 10% in March. But this has been achievedthrough a recession that businessmen say has paralyzed theeconomy and Peru's poor say is close to unbearable.   In a bid to relaunch the economy, Finance Minister CarlosBolona Behr recently announced a series of measures,including a lowering of import duties, cuts in export taxes,a 10% cut in the government's operating costs, privatizationof 23 state companies and liberalization of foreign-exchangerules. While unlikely to produce immediate results -- infact, some businessmen fear they could ruin parts of Peru'slong-protected domestic industry -- many say the real aim ofthe liberalization measures is to speed up support frominternational lending organizations.   Mr. Fujimori has made a priority of re-establishing tiesto lenders, which have been severely strained ever since hispredecessor, Alan Garcia, unilaterally limited debt servicingto 10% of export earnings. But fresh money hasn't beenforthcoming, and Mr. Fujimori says Peru might have to defaulton some payments again because the recession and the choleraepidemic deprived the government of tax revenue.   Peru is also hoping that the imminent signing of an accordwith the U.S. to fight drugs will improve its standing. Theplan provides for a comprehensive strategy to attack the drugproblem, combining military aid with plans for cropsubstitution and improvement in infrastructure to allow themarketing of other products.   But the real test of the plan will come in itsimplementation. Mr. Fujimori says the $60 million in economicassistance and the $34.5 million in military aid the U.S. isoffering are &quot;insufficient.&quot; Some say corruption within themilitary and police makes their cooperation questionable.Moreover, some fear power struggles between the governmentand the organization that will oversee the plan.   A further complication is the growing hold of terrorism inthe Upper Huallaga Valley, Peru's coca-producing region. Bysome estimates -- which Mr. Fujimori disputes -- thefanatical Maoist guerrilla group Shining Path controlsbetween 25% and 40% of the Peruvian countryside, in additionto carrying out bomb attacks in the capital. The governmentis also confronting a second, urban terrorist group calledthe Tupac Amaru Revoutionary Movement, or MRTA.   Mr. Fujimori says the government is working in the shadeto decapitate the groups and claims important intelligenceadvances have been made. But just as the government claimsprogress in its fight against Shining Path, it has beenembarrassed by the escape from jail of Maria Lucero CumpoaMiranda, one of the presumed leaders of the MRTA's recentbombing campaign.   Despite its shortcomings and failings, many Peruvians seeMr. Fujimori's government as an improvement over Mr.Garcia's. &quot;In economic terms, we've gone from an irrationalgovernment to a mediocre one, and that's a great advance,&quot;says pollster Felipe Ortiz de Zevallos. But he and othersworry how much longer Peru can afford to waste time andenergy in sterile fights. &quot;How many trains can Peru miss?&quot; heasks.</TEXT></DOC>
