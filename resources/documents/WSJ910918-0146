Testimony released yesterday shows that a senior CIAofficer, who raised early warnings of improprieties, fearedputting his analysis in writing because of concern that theaccusations would be shown to the White House.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;I was hesitant to allege in writing that White Houseofficials directing the project, including the nationalsecurity adviser, were engaged in highly questionable, if notillegal, activities,&quot; said Charles Allen, explaining why hecrafted an October 1986 memorandum to play down evidence offunds being diverted in the operation. &quot;To put this inwriting . . . did not seem prudent.&quot;   In later questioning, Mr. Gates himself acknowledged that,even as the CIA's No. 2 man, he had been hesitant tochallenge the entrenched power of the agency's operationsdivision in this period.   And while insisting he had welcomed alternative views asan analyst, Mr. Gates disclosed he had successfully urged theState Department to suppress objections to a 1985 report thatserved to advance Director William Casey's early agenda inthe Iran-Contra affair.   At issue was a CIA intelligence estimate that became partof an effort to rethink U.S.-Iranian relations and to makeselective arms sales to Tehran. Though the document'ssignificance wasn't appreciated then by many, it was used byMr. Casey and others to lay the groundwork for the Iraninitiative. The late director sought to avoid dissent thatcould raise obstacles for policy makers, so when analysts atthe State Department's intelligence bureau raised objections,Mr. Gates telephoned Morton Abramowitz, then chief of theintelligence bureau. Mr. Abramowitz, later U.S. ambassador toTurkey, ultimately agreed not to press for a footnote despitethe continued dissent in his shop at the State Department.   The revelations came as Mr. Gates completed his second dayof questioning before the Senate Intelligence Committee,which is now expected to call him back next week for furthertestimony after hearing related CIA and intelligencewitnesses tomorrow and Friday. Partisan skirmishing coloredthe early exchanges yesterday. But behind solid, almostunquestioning GOP support, the national security aide appearsconfident of overriding Democratic critics and winning thetop job that eluded him once before in 1987.   His poised, controlled style contrasts with frequentmemory lapses regarding Iran-Contra, and this record will bejudged against live testimony tomorrow from Alan Fiers, chiefof the CIA's Central American Task Force in the mid-1980s.Mr. Fiers has acknowledged in federal court to knowingdetails of the Contra supply network run from the White Houseand financed by profits from the U.S. arms sales to Iran.Questioning by senators yesterday was based in some cases oninformation already provided by Mr. Fiers, and Mr. Gates wasforced back to the awkward position of saying he couldn'trecall key events.   Among these was an October 1986 meeting in Mr. Casey'soffice following the shooting down of a cargo plane carryingsupplies to the Contras inside Nicaragua. CIA documentsindicate that Mr. Gates was present at the evening sessionalso attended by Mr. Fiers, and Chairman David Boren twiceasked the nominee if he had any recollection of being told byMr. Fiers or a second CIA officer that the lost transport was&quot;Ollie's plane&quot; -- a reference to Marine Lt. Col. OliverNorth, who oversaw the Contra supply operation.   Mr. Gates said that he had no recollection of such aremark or of the meeting more generally. Similarly, he saidthat he had no memory of a conversation that summer that Mr.Fiers has described as being related to a plan to have theCIA buy millions in assets owned by Col. North's network. Theproposal had been advanced by President Reagan's nationalsecurity advisers, and senators said Mr. Fiers had told thecommittee of receiving a call from Mr. Gates regarding theplan long before the operation was disclosed publicly.   In connection with current investigations into the Bank ofCredit andamp; Commerce International, Mr. Gates was more precise,and his testimony sheds new light on the CIA's interactionwith banking regulators. Mr. Gates said that the CIA had longhad a &quot;very awkward&quot; relationship with the Federal Reservebut that it had responded to specific requests by theTreasury Department relevant to BCCI in the fall of 1984.This request, Mr. Gates said, was what led to an early CIAreport in January 1985 that went to the Treasury and,ultimately, to the Comptroller of the Currency's office. Thatreport included information describing BCCI's interest inFirst American in Washington, according to previousstatements by CIA and other intelligence officials.   In the post Cold War era, Mr. Gates's ambitions for theCIA include a role in economic intelligence. But he sought tonarrow this agenda to two areas affecting business and tradeabroad. He indicated that intelligence assets abroad could beused to gather information that would be useful to U.S.negotiators seeking to establish a more &quot;level playing field&quot;regarding subsidies and trade competition. And secondly, inconnection with the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the CIAcould play a counter-espionage role to blunt efforts byforeign intelligence services seeking to steal technologyfrom U.S. firms.</TEXT></DOC>
