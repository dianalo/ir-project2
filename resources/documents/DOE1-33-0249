Thedata belonging to a certain radiation detector can be recognized by theoutput signal duration of the detector electronic circuits. The analoguemethod of spectrometric data transmission from several ionizing radiationdetectors via a single communication line enables to reduce data distortioncaused by superposition of separate detector pulses in the communicationline 2-3 times as compared with the digital ones at similar amplituderesolution of both methods. The developed system is designed for connectionof up to 12 removable detectors to a party line. This number of detectorsis limited mainly by data distortion in the communication line causedby superpositions of pulses from separate detectors. 3 refs.; 6 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
