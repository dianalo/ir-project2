LaserJet printers.andM;According to Dan Steele, manager of Microsoft Corp.'s Printer Business Unitin Redmond, Wash., Microsoft is fast at work to iron out the system's bugsand shortcomings cited by users and developers.andP;  &quot;We'll also continue workingwith vendors to polish OS/2 printer drivers and expand printer support forthe system,&quot; he said.andM;Still, software developers need to refine printer drivers to ease printingfrom within OS/2 applications, said Mike Drips, a micro manager at UnitedTelecom in Overland Park, Kan.andM;Both Drips and Holmes say problems increase when printing from within OS/2applications.andP;  For example, Holmes has problems printing scalable fonts whenusing Excel and Describe packages under OS/2.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
