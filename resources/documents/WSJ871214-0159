The rating concern said the action follows the Florida Legislature's repeal of the 5% service tax effective Jan. 1, 1988, and its replacement with a 1% increase in the state's sales tax on goods, effective Feb. 1, 1988. Florida Gov. Bob Martinez signed the legislation Friday.    Sandamp;P placed Florida's debt on CreditWatch Sept. 23 with negative implications because of concern that if the new service tax was repealed, it wouldn't be adequately replaced.    The rating agency said that while the replacement tax is estimated to generate about $100 million less than the service tax would have raised in fiscal 1988, and $140 million less in fiscal 1989, Florida will still generate an operating surplus. </TEXT></DOC>
