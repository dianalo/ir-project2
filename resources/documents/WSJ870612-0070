At a news conference held on the lawn of his hotel here, Mr. Reagan seemed to break with his administration's repeated declarations that the dollar shouldn't fall further. He told reporters that &quot;most of us believe that the dollar should remain stable.&quot; But then he added that &quot;it could be within reason that there could still be some lowering of the value in relation to other currencies.&quot;    In response to the news of the Reagan remark, the dollar eased a bit to 1.7900 West German marks, the intraday low, from 1.7960 marks.    But shortly after the news conference, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater quickly issued a clarification, declaring that &quot;what the president wants is stability for the dollar, in other words, no change.&quot;    Less than an hour after the decline began, the dollar had recovered to 1.7940 marks. If market players had taken the remark more seriously, the dollar would have fallen much further, traders said.    Later in the day, a senior White House official said that Mr. Reagan, on returning to his hotel room after the news conference, had seen a report of the dollar remark on the Cable News Network, which was being piped into Americans' hotel rooms here. According to the aide, the president then reached Mr. Fitzwater on the lawn at a special outdoor phone and told him &quot;he wanted to make sure the message was that we are looking for a stable dollar and not predicting the dollar is going to fall.&quot;    Last February, at the Louvre in Paris, finance ministers of the seven summit nations agreed that the dollar had fallen far enough. Since then, U.S. and foreign officials, including President Reagan himself, had repeatedly stressed that view. While the currency has fallen since February, it has finally stabilized in recent weeks against the mark and the Japanese yen.    The misstatement was only the latest in a series that has plagued the White House since the president arrived here last week for the summit meeting. The president's aides first said it was &quot;unlikely&quot; Mr. Reagan would ease trade sanctions against Japan; then he did so.    They predicted the opening summit dinner would dwell on the Persian Gulf, then had to admit that subject never came up. They said the president asked West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl to extradite a terrorist; then the president denied it.    On other economic matters at the news conference, Mr. Reagan said that despite repeated urgings in the summit communique for a lowering of budget deficits, he planned no new approach to the problem. &quot;I'd like to continue and be more successful with the old methods that we've been trying,&quot; he said. He repeated his familiar call for Congress to cut spending, and offered no suggestion of any change in his refusal to support tax increases.    Mr. Reagan will have another opportunity to put a positive face on the economic summit when he gives a speech to the nation from the White House Monday night. One senior White House official said that talk also will lay out the president's domestic agenda for the summer months, including his approach to the federal budget deficit. Mr. Reagan also will provide a progress report then on arms-control discussions with North Atlantic Treaty Organization foreign ministers in Iceland this week.    The president plans to go to West Berlin today to deliver a speech challenging Soviet Leader Mikhail Gorbachev to prove his &quot;glasnost&quot; policy by tearing down the Berlin wall. But at his news conference, the president took a surprisingly mild tone toward the Soviet Union and Mr. Gorbachev. He said he thought the Soviet leader was sincere in seeking arms reductions and that &quot;I believe there is an increased opportunity for a summit conference&quot; with Mr. Gorbachev. He said there was also &quot;an increased opportunity for actual reductions in armaments.&quot;    Turning to the Persian Gulf situation, Mr. Reagan insisted that &quot;there was no criticism from any of our allies&quot; on the U.S. posture warning Iran that deploying Silkworm missiles would be a hostile act likely to earn a military response from the U.S. That contradicted widespread comments by representatives of foreign leaders at the summit, who made it clear that they were alarmed by the tough rhetoric from U.S. officials on a possible pre-emptive strike against the Iran missiles.    Mr. Reagan said he did not specifically ask the allies for more physical assistance in escorting Kuwaiti oil tankers in the Persian Gulf that have been placed under American flags. Indeed, his aides had scrapped anticipated summit proposals for more military, diplomatic or possible financial assistance in policing the Gulf, after determining before the summit that the allies were cool to such commitments.    Answering questions about the Iran-Contra scandal, Mr. Reagan denied that Lt. Col. Oliver North and the National Security Council acted, as some have testified during the congressional hearings, with his blessing or authority in their Iran-Contra activities. &quot;Evidently maybe some people were giving the impression that they were acting on orders from me. Well, I wasn't giving those orders, because no one had asked or had told me what was truly happening there,&quot; he said.    When asked further if he thought the law barring direct or indirect military aid to the Nicaraguan Contra rebels applied to him as president, Mr. Reagan said: &quot;I not only think it didn't, but I don't think that the law was broken. We're talking about a case of people that on their own -- individuals and groups in our country -- sought to send aid to the freedom fighters.&quot;    He said he stood by Secretary of State George Shultz's decision that Assistant Secretary of State Elliott Abrams should remain in office, despite his admission that he misled Congress on the Contra aid program.    ---   Charles W.
