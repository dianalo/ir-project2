Grass, were indicted by an Ohio grand jury on bribery charges.    The charges were brought in connection with an alleged attempt by Mr. Grass to bribe a state pharmacy regulator in April. Although the indictments were handed up June 14, the Cuyahoga County court kept them secret until yesterday.    Lt. James Veres, who is in charge of the county sheriff's detectives division, said the secrecy was necessary so that further allegations involving state government officials could be investigated. No other parties have been charged.    The indictments against Mr. Grass and the company represent an important juncture in the bizarre and protracted case, which has already harmed the reputation of Rite Aid, the nation's largest drug-store chain. It isn't clear how much the developments could ultimately hurt Rite Aid's business in Ohio, where it operates 349 stores. Moreover, regulators indicated that even if the company is convicted of bribery, its license to do business in the state probably won't be revoked. The court could, however, impose other penalties.    Rite Aid expressed confidence that Mr. Grass and the company would eventually be exonerated, but the stock market reacted negatively to the news. In active trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Rite Aid closed at $38.75 a share, down 87.5 cents.    On April 27, Mr. Grass, the 35-year-old son of Rite Aid Chairman Alex Grass, was arrested by sheriff's deputies in a hotel room in Cleveland after he handed a $33,000 corporate check to Melvin Wilczynski, a state pharmacy board member. In the hotel room, Mr. Grass also offered Mr. Wilczynski about $36,000 in health benefits for himself and his ailing mother. In exchange, Mr. Wilczynski was asked to sign six copies of an undated resignation letter addressed to Ohio Gov. Richard F. Celeste, who makes pharmacy board appointments.    The meeting was videotaped by county sheriff's deputies who were waiting next door. The tape was used in presenting the case to the grand jury. In addition, the corporate plane in which Mr. Grass flew from Harrisburg, Pa., was confiscated and used as evidence of a &quot;criminal tool.&quot;    An assistant county prosecutor, William R. Caine, charged in April that the payment was part of a Rite Aid scheme to gain control of the regulatory board and to soften vigorous regulatory enforcement against the corporation's 349 Ohio pharmacies, which contribute about 10% of the company's business.    Mr. Grass's attorneys and Rite Aid officials reiterated their denial of any wrongful intent. &quot;We don't have any formal statement yet, but we would stick by our previous comment,&quot; said Suzanne Mead, a Rite Aid official. The company has consistently claimed that the charges are without merit because the payment Mr. Grass made to Mr. Wilczynski was a legitimate buy-out of a consulting contract, not a bribe. &quot;As the facts become public,&quot; Ms. Mead said, &quot;we feel they {Martin Grass and Rite Aid} will be exonerated.&quot;    The bribery charge is a third-degree felony. If convicted, Mr. Grass faces a prison term of three to 10 years and substantial fines, according to Lt. Veres.    Neither Martin Grass nor his attorneys could be reached for comment. Rite Aid officials declined to comment any further on the impact of the indictment on business operations.    Mr. Wilczynski, who cooperated with investigators in the case, declined to comment on the indictments or to predict how the state pharmacy board might respond. &quot;There are eight of us,&quot; he said. &quot;I don't know where the board would go as a group.&quot;    Even if Rite Aid is convicted, industry analysts don't expect the case to cause the company lasting financial damage. &quot;In the worst case, there would be a fine for the corporation, but they would continue to do business in the state,&quot; predicted Monroe Greenstein, an analyst for Bear Stearns andamp; Co. &quot;States are loathe to shut business out of their borders.&quot;    Ohio Board of Pharmacy members said they expect to take a wait-and-see approach to the case. According to board counsel David Rowland, such criminal cases aren't within the panel's jurisdiction. The company apparently hasn't violated any pharmacy laws, he said, and the board hasn't any power to impose administrative penalties in bribery cases, even those involving board members. </TEXT></DOC>
