 The Soil ConservationService deals with water and soil conservation.andP;  But the Forest Service,which manages public lands, also is involved.andP;  The Environmental ProtectionAgency has a concern for water quality.andP;  So do the Interior Department'sBureau of Reclamation, Bureau of Land Management and Fish and WildlifeService.andM;Information about water resources is scattered in all these differentagencies.andP;  From an information resources management standpoint, that is primafacie evidence of the need for interoperability and interconnectivity to moveinformation from EPA to Agriculture to Interior.andM;Five years ago, it would have been perceived as nearly impossible.andP;  Today, weknow we can do it, but not without some difficulty in conversion protocols.andO;When the Government Open Systems Interconnection Profile and Posix are fullyimplemented with all their associated standards, I think we'll harness theresources of government on cross-cutting issues much more effectively andefficiently than we can now.andM;Within Agriculture, this cross-cutting means it is essential to deal morewith the information resource and less with the hardware and technology.andM;I've seen the federal government as a whole move its primary concern fromtechnology issues to information management issues.andM;We're interested in the technology, but the payoff over the next five yearswill be in information issues.andM;I think technology issues are going to take care of themselves.andP;  I have saidin the past that we have enough technology to do almost anything, if we couldfigure out precisely how we want to handle the information.andP;  Not that wedon't need new equipment, but we probably are not using all the equipment wehave to maximum efficiency.andM;GCN: What about the quality of ADP equipment and services as IRM budgetsdecline?andM;HANEY: We can get more technology for our dollar today than five years ago.andO;So the fact that we have fewer dollars hasn't impacted quite as hard as itcould.andM;I don't have a good feel for that in the future.andP;  The technology refreshmentissue is tough.andP;  Perhaps there's a role for industry and the contractingcommunity to work together on what's best.andM;We have to continue to move toward open systems; there's absolutely noalternative.andP;  Industry is beginning to recognize that's where the federalgovernment is going to go.andM;The General Services Administration has some serious concerns about longsystem life in a contract.andP;  Congressional investigations of contracts havecaused everybody to be a little gun shy.andP;  We can't get a long system lifeanymore, we can't have a really complex contract without increasing the riskof protests.andM;That pushes us to shorter timeframes, more commodity buys, which don't giveus the opportunity to deal with obsolescence as effectively as we'd like.andM;GCN: Are agencies getting enough or too much oversight today?andM;HANEY: From an agency perspective, I guess they always think they're gettingtoo much oversight.andP;  There has to be balance between the amount of authoritythey have and the amount of oversight exercised by the central agencies.andM;It's too easy for an IRM manager to say to the oversight agencies, &quot;Give uswhat we ask for and let us go.andP;  We're going to do good.&quot;andP;  If I take thatposition, I am ignoring the validity of their role.andM;I guess there needs to be a partnership between the senior IRM professionalsand the oversight agencies, that can be built only by open communication.andO;Frank Reeder at the Office of Management and Budget and Tom Buckholtz andFrank McDonough at GSA are working together with IRM professionals to developbetter direction and long-term strategy.andP;  OMB has the federal IRM policycouncil, which is at the peak of its effectiveness now.andM;It's irresponsible to take an agency-only position without giving someconsideration to the government as a whole.andP;  In the Forest Service, I workedfor a regional forester who said, &quot;I manage everything in my region.andP;  I alsowear the hat that makes me a member of the chief's management team at thenational headquarters.andP;  So I have a dual responsibility.&quot;andM;I've used that principle in my own thinking, that a manager always wears twohats.andP;  Too often executives forget they are members of a bigger team.andP;  In theIRM field, the bigger team is the whole federal IRM community.andM;GCN: You were in the government for 37 years.andP;  If you could start over, wouldyou do anything differently?andM;HANEY: Not really.andP;  I don't have any regrets at all.andP;  I started out as aresearch forester.andP;  I spent eight years at the ground level, developed aninterest in people and then recognized I was never really going to be anoutstanding scientist.andP;  My skills were more in management.andP;  So I moved out ofresearch but stayed with the Forest Service.andM;From 1976 to the present, I've been managing information systems full time.andO;I've had an oppotunity to make a positive contribution to the department andI feel good about that.andM;GCN: Some Agriculture agencies seem enthusiastic about FTS 2000, others arenot.andP;  What are your concerns?andM;HANEY: Some agencies may have reservations about parts of it.andP;  Thedepartment's position has been that FTS 2000 will be the source for theservices it provides, essentially long-haul voice and data communication.andO;Telecommunications within the department will be managed centrally to getefficient use of the network.andM;Agriculture has 15,000 field offices.andP;  If four county offices in a ruralcommunity need data and long-distance voice communications, it makes sense toconsolidate into one switch or one access node all the telecommunicationsvolume from those four offices.andP;  You get a better price.andP;  The only way tomake sure that happens is to have central direction and management acrossagency boundaries.andM;There are some concerns that we think will be worked out.andP;  Some elements arenot yet adequately covered by FTS 2000, and the department is working withGSA to figure out how to do that.andP;  Satellite communication isn't availableunder the contract.andP;  Once we had concerns about dial-up X.25 capability, butI think that's being resolved.andM;The electronic-mail service in the FTS 2000 contract is bare bones.andP;  Itdoesn't come close to the service the department is getting from Telenet, andthat doesn't give everything they would like.andP;  Whether other arrangementswill have to be made is still up in the air.andM;There are some concerns with billing procedures but I think those, too, arebeing worked out.andP;  Within Agriculture, some agencies have moretelecommunications capabilities than others simply by virtue of their size.andM;The department delegates to agencies, commensurate with their capability, theoperation of their portion of the FTS 2000 network.andP;  It's going to be a jointmanagement activity between the central IRM office and the agencies.andM;GCN: What were the major IRM milestones at Agriculture under your leadership?andM;HANEY: We were one of the first civilian agencies to implement adepartmentwide, nationwide data communication network eight years ago.andP;  Ithink it's had a big pay-off.andM;The one regret I have is that as FTS 2000 was being conceived, most of theupfront planning dealt with voice communication and Agriculture's experiencein data communication was not brought to bear.andP;  I feel bad that thepioneering work we did didn't get folded into the planning of FTS 2000 datacommunication.andM;One of the other milestones is that we effectively put automation in thehands of 90 percent of Agriculture's work force.andP;  In 1982 about 10 percent ofthe field offices outside Washington had some sort of automation.andP;  By 1988,90 percent did.andM;Of the four agencies with a large field structure -- the Forest Service,Farmers Home Administration, Soil Conservation Service and AgriculturalStabilization and Conservation Service -- three have automation in all theirfield offices.andP;  That's a major accomplishment.andM;Another is that we streamlined our mainframe computing.andP;  We consolidated ourworkload from our Washington computer center to our Kansas City computercenter.andM;We were able to transfer the physical assets and people here in Washington tothe Navy, where they have become an effective unit.andP;  It saved Agriculturemoney, and it didn't have any adverse impact on people.andP;  We reduced the unitcosts for mainframe computing for all our agencies.andM;Another milestone is the Computerized Information Delivery Service.andP;  Weplaced time-sensitive agricultural commodity information in an electronicposting system.andP;  We were the first to have such a system to give allinterested parties the information immediately and at the same time.andM;Another is the development and implementation of long-range IRM planning asrequired by the Paperwork Reduction Act.andP;  Before 1982, there was nolong-range IRM planning in the department.andM;We put in place a planning process useful to the agencies and to us from anoversight standpoint.andP;  Every other year the agencies make a completerevision.andP;  In the off year, they make an amendment, always looking out fiveyears.andP;  The long-range plan calls for them to identify the resources they aregoing to need in both dollars and people.andP;  We insisted those requirements beconsistent with their budget.andM;In 1985, we took a look where we thought IRM ought to be in 1990.andP;  In 1988,we took another look and decided to update it to where we want to be in 1995.andO;Now the department is taking another look at the strategic direction.andM;Folks say, &quot;How do you make sure people live with the plan?&quot;andM;My philosophy is, that's a secondary issue.andP;  Certainly you monitor dollarresources to be sure you can cover a major acquisition in the plan.andP;  Butthere's nothing wrong with an agency not doing everything in the five-yearplan.andP;  Plans are a tool, never a straitjacket.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
