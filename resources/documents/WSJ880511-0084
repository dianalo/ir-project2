The strike's inconclusive end appeared to close Poland's first major wave of labor strife since the government of Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski declared martial law in late 1981.    It was a victory for neither side. Both Solidarity, which failed to draw Polish workers around the country into sympathy strikes, and the government, whose planned economic and social liberalizations have probably been set back, came out losers.    The several hundred workers who had occupied the shipyard marched out at about 8 p.m., local time, yesterday. They were led by Lech Walesa, the 44-year-old electrician who founded Solidarity, the first independent labor union in the Soviet bloc, in August 1980. The shipyard was the cradle of Solidarity during 1980 strikes that brought down the government of Communist leader Edward Gierek. But Solidarity was suppressed, then outlawed, when martial law was imposed Dec. 13, 1981.    The latest shipyard strike was the last of a string of Polish strikes that began April 25. They were sparked by broad price increases imposed by the government since February as part of reforms designed to lead Poland toward a more efficient &quot;socialist market economy.&quot;    The strikes started with a wildcat transport stoppage organized by members of Poland's official Communist-led trade unions in the central city of Bydgoszcz. Solidarity supporters quickly pulled workers off their jobs in two big steel mills in Krakow and Stalowa Wola, but a police assault broke the Krakow strike and the Stalowa Wola protest collapsed when authorities met pay demands.    Support for the shipyard strike began melting away when workers across Poland ignored Solidarity's call for sympathy stoppages. The strikers said in a statement they had left the yard of their own free will and that their struggle would continue.    &quot;Poland is deep in crisis and the authorities treat the country as their own property,&quot; the statement said. &quot;We leave not in triumph but with raised heads. Our strike should make everybody aware that one has to fight to win.&quot;    Government spokesman Jerzy Urban contended at a news conference that the strikes had failed to gain the support of the Polish working class and the country at large. </TEXT></DOC>
