The transmissibility of quarz optical fiberwas kept more than 70% after heated to 500{sup 0}C. But the invasionof outside light was observed in case of ET-10/60, and outside lightintensity increased at temperature more than 200{sup 0}C. In case ofother optical fibers, the outside light intensity becomes maximum at200{sup 0}C. These may be caused by the stress occurred from differenceof thermal expansion between the quarz fiber core and the clad material.The clad is molten and decomposed at 300-500{sup 0}C, resulting lowerstress and outside light, but the outside light increases again by theincrease of thermal radiation in the furnace along with temperature rise.(5 figs, 2 tabs, 1 ref)</TEXT></DOC>
