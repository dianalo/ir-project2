The expected move is in response to better-than-expected sales of its new midsized pickup truck. A company spokeswoman wouldn't confirm or deny the move, but an official announcement is expected today.    Earlier this year, the No. 1 auto maker said a rosier sales picture induced it to restore full shifts to four plants where output previously had been slashed because of slow demand.    GM is expected to start the second shift of production at its Pontiac East complex by September. The second shift of the recently opened plant was originally scheduled to start last summer, but was indefinitely delayed.    Under the initial plans, the second shift would have employed about 1,300 workers. It isn't clear how many new jobs will be created for the additional output. </TEXT></DOC>
