The group said Ford violated a provision of the 1986 anti-apartheid act banning new investment in South Africa by investing $61 million in a company there in which it owns a 42% stake.    The investment is related to Ford's plan to divest itself of its interest in South African Motor Corp., which is 58%-owned by South Africa-based Anglo-American Corp.    Ford officials said the $61 million payment was simply part of its previously announced plan to pull out of the South African subsidiary.    The company said its Nov. 24 divestiture agreement with the subsidiary called for Ford to repay its portion of the subsidiary's debt, or $61 million.    The Treasury Department said it doesn't plan to take action against Ford.    Meanwhile, Congress, in its overall budget bill for the year that began Oct. 1, approved a provision that prohibits U.S. companies from taking a tax credit against taxes paid in South Africa.    The measure, written by Rep. Charles Rangel (D., N.Y.), would cost Ford about $20 million in the current fiscal year and an estimated $23 million in fiscal 1989, according to the congressional Joint Committee on Taxation.    The confusion over whether Ford violated the law concerns an exception that allows new investment in South Africa in a U.S.-controlled company that is in danger of closing down or operating at &quot;an uneconomical level.&quot;    The Treasury has accepted Ford's claim for the exception, agreeing that the company effectively controls the joint venture because of certain arrangements it has with Anglo-American. The Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control, which monitors the investment provisions of the law, said, &quot;on the basis of what the office now knows, the office plans to take no further action against Ford.&quot;    A Ford spokesman said, &quot;All parties have been notified about this in a timely fashion,&quot; adding, &quot;The workers in South Africa, the Treasury Department and congressmen who expressed interest in our plan knew about this investment. Since we recognize that the Treasury Department has enforcement power over this legislation, we ran it by them. If it was not legal we expected them to notify us and they didn't.&quot;    But the legislators claim Ford's investment is designed to help ease its departure from South Africa and part of an arrangement under which Anglo-American will continue to buy parts and certain services from Ford. They say Ford has indicated that shortly after it makes the investment it will leave South Africa, and thus the investment doesn't benefit a U.S.-controlled company.    Nine lawmakers are in the group criticizing Ford, including Rep. Howard Wolpe (D., Mich.), chairman of the House Foreign Affairs subcommittee on Africa, and Rep. William Gray (D., Pa.), chairman of the Budget Committee. The anti-apartheid organizations include Washington, D.C.-based TransAfrica.    &quot;The purpose of this money isn't to help Ford survive in South Africa, as allowed under the legislation, but to let a South African-controlled firm stay viable,&quot; said a subcommittee aide. &quot;Our fear is that other firms will start doing the same thing.&quot;    The U.S. legislators said Ford's subsidiary will use the $61 million to pay debt, as part of a $400 million, seven-year plan to retool and re-equip to be more competitive. They say this agreement benefits Ford, which continues to maintain ties with the company.    In the past two years, 101 U.S. companies have left South Africa, according to the Investor Responsibility Research Center, a private group. The group said 51 of these companies have retained ties with former subsidiaries.    Ford has reached two separate agreements for divestment from South Africa. Under an agreement with the National Union of Mineworkers of South Africa, Ford will turn over 24% of the equity to an employee-run trust for workers. Ford will sell the balance of its stake to Anglo-American for a nominal amount and retain certain licensing and supply agreements. </TEXT></DOC>
