Signs arise that Iraq may seek arms from the U.S., figuring the request would be hard to refuse. But such a plan would stir congressional opposition. Jordan's Hussein sends a scathing letter to Reagan about arms sales to enemies while Congress blocks weapons to his nation.    European allies fear the Soviets will offer Reagan an arms-control deal that would help him at home but hurt Europe's interests. A U.S. concern is that countries will be reluctant to join in secret operations. Saudi leaders worry that more details of secret cooperation with the U.S. might leak out.    Disclosure worries also could undercut Pakistan's willingness to pass arms to Afghan rebels.    PRESIDENTIAL HOPEFULS warily eye the Iran flap's political fallout.    Dole uses the crisis to show decisiveness, but one Republican fears that he is overly critical. Kemp, courting disaffected conservatives, keeps his distance from the scandal; he shuns TV talk shows. Bush is in peril. But his political adviser, Lee Atwater, warns that rivals who try to &quot;make hay&quot; at Bush's expense &quot;may find it backfires.&quot;    Democrats try to avoid appearing overzealous. Nunn may gain most from his role in Senate probes, which could push him closer to a White House bid. Hart emphasizes military and foreign affairs. Cuomo and other governors could benefit. &quot;Competence can be an issue when an administration has been inept,&quot; says analyst William Schneider. But governors lack foreign-policy experience.    PRESSURES GROW for some form of tax rise, but resistance remains.    Reagan &quot;is just as adamant as before against a tax increase,&quot; insists budget chief Miller. Yet the president's &quot;inability to play Rambo&quot; on Iran may embolden some Democrats to press him on the tax issue, says one top Democratic Senate staffer. Lawmakers from both parties bluntly tell Shultz that prospects for more foreign-aid money are dim without a tax rise.    A Regan resignation could raise the odds of a tax increase. Wall Street analysts reason that a new chief of staff would be more pragmatic about a tax rise to lower the deficit and help deflect attention from foreign-policy flubs. Friends of former cabinet member Drew Lewis say he might seek a commitment to address the deficit problem if he is offered Regan's job.    While nobody expects the president to accept a general tax rise, some lawmakers envision him agreeing to a consumption levy, such as an energy tax.    SUPPORT SLIPS for a U.S. role in Central America in the wake of disclosures of a Contra connection in the Iran arms deal. Some 49% of Americans surveyed in a new Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll say there is too much U.S. involvement, up from 34% in September 1983. Sixty-five percent oppose U.S. military aid to the Contras.    LUGAR WINS praise for his handling of foreign-affairs issues and his criticism of the White House staff in the Iran flap. The Indiana senator is expected to easily defeat North Carolina Sen. Helms for the top GOP spot on the Foreign Relations Committee and is seen as a possible vice presidential candidate in 1988.    SUPERFUND SLOWDOWN: Reagan has yet to delegate the powers of the recently signed toxic-waste legislation to EPA officials. Until he does, the agency can't set cleanup plans or agree to company cleanup proposals. Some at EPA fear a repeat of 1981, when Reaganites stalled for months before delegating Superfund authority.    SAY AMEN: The Federal Home Loan Bank Board's general counsel reprimands lawyers there for bickering over computers by reading to them from the Bible. The verse: &quot;Let all bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and clamour, and evil speaking be put away from you, with all malice; and be ye kind one to another. . . .&quot;    PHONE CHANGES will stir more conflict and consumer costs.    The Justice Department next month will recommend updates to the 1984 order breaking up ATandamp;T. Federal Judge Harold Greene is expected to approve a probable proposal to let regional phone companies manufacture equipment. But he may resist other likely ideas, such as letting the companies enter long-distance service and electronic publishing.    If the judge fails to ease restrictions enough, he could be overturned on appeal, says communications consultant Harry Shooshan III. Meanwhile, the FCC early next year is expected to propose up to a doubling of consumers' monthly $2 phone-line charge. An initial effort to set the fee at $6 was dropped after Congress howled, but reaction may be nil this time.    &quot;Members have seen the first $2 take effect and no one from the public is objecting much yet,&quot; says one congressional staffer.    MINOR MEMOS: The Iranian crisis, one current joke goes, &quot;is causing Reagan a lot of sleepless afternoons.&quot; . . . Christopher Matthews, House Speaker O'Neill's oft-quoted spokesman, will become president of Government Research Corp., which advises businesses on government. . . . The VPs, a corporate-parody rock group, plans to record a song called &quot;Insider Tradin'.&quot; . . . An Army official refers to reducing the service's budget request as completing &quot;a decrement drill.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
