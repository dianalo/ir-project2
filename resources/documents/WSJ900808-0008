But the U.S. isscrambling to minimize the damage the boycott could do to itsown economy.   Saudi Arabia yesterday agreed to increase its oilproduction in a move that could cushion much of the comingembargo-related oil shock, according to senior Bushadministration officials. The Saudis didn't commit to aspecific increase in production, although there wereindications that talks would continue. The White House hadbeen seeking an increase of about two million barrels a dayin the kingdom's current output of 5.4 million barrels a day.</LP><TEXT>   The agreement represented a major breakthrough in thegrowing global campaign against Mr. Hussein. The Saudis inrecent years have forsworn their one-time role as the &quot;swingproducer&quot; in OPEC, and have always resisted appearingsensitive to Western influence. In the delicately balancedworld-wide oil market, two million barrels a day of extraproduction could cut several dollars from the price of abarrel of crude.   Also yesterday, Vice President Dan Quayle met withVenezuelan President Carlos Andres Perez, who reversed hisearlier position and agreed to increase his nation's oilproduction by 500,000 barrels a day, according to anadministration official traveling with the vice president.   In addition, the U.S. decided to send a representative toa meeting of the International Energy Agency tomorrow todiscuss plans for the U.S., Germany, Japan and other nationsto use jointly their strategic petroleum reserves to ease thepain of the embargo. Officials say the White House has notyet decided whether it will use the U.S. reserve but wants to&quot;feel out&quot; the other nations.   The embargo of Iraqi oil began to show its full forceyesterday. Turkey said it is turning away ships loading oilfrom an Iraqi oil export pipeline. And the flow of oilthrough Iraq's pipeline across Saudi Arabia also is likely tobe shut down by Sunday, oil experts say, because storagetanks will be full and tankers aren't loading the oil. Thatmeans Mr. Hussein will lose, for now, the oil revenues heneeds to maintain his military machine and feed his army.   &quot;Realistically, he ought to be recalculating,&quot; saysRichard Murphy, the State Department's top Middle Eastdiplomat in the Reagan administration. &quot;It is hard tobelieve, though we don't know, that he had expected theopposition that was generated in the last few days.&quot;   But U.S. government estimates show Iraq has enough food tolast into the fall, even without oil money. &quot;I think the foodsituation is better than it has been for some years,&quot; saysJonathan Crusoe, an Iraqi specialist at the Middle EastEconomic Digest who just returned from that country. &quot;There'smore local produce in the shops than before.&quot;   In the meantime, soaring oil prices could cut deep intothe economies of the rest of the world. That means thatunless the Mideast standoff explodes into a militaryconfrontation, Iraq and the industrialized world will becaught in a high-stakes war of nerves to see who flinchesfirst.   Mr. Hussein is a hardened risk taker, who has shown thathe has incredible staying power and the ruthlessness to win.When he tried, at the age of 22, to assassinate Iraq'smilitary leader, he was shot in the attempt and dug thebullet out of his thigh as he fled across the desert. And heproved he could endure a decade of intense economic painduring the Iran-Iraq war. &quot;I think in a sense he does havemore patience than we do,&quot; says Kenneth Katzman, a defenseconsultant who studied Mr. Hussein as a Central IntelligenceAgency analyst. &quot;Just choking him off won't deflate him.&quot;   Moreover, Mr. Hussein may get some help from neighboringJordan, which has supported Iraq's move and could provide anoverland route for bringing in food and other vital imports.In addition, Turkish truck drivers, whose workload hasdeclined since the Iran-Iraq war ended, will undoubtedly beitching to sneak loads of goods across the long Iraqi-Turkishborder.   Mr. Hussein is also likely to try to intimidate other oilsheikdoms, particularly Saudi Arabia, into giving him money.&quot;Even if the embargo works 100%, they (the Iraqis) will stillhave revenues because the Saudis are going to pay bribes,&quot;says Patrick Clawson, an economist at the Foreign PolicyResearch Institute who has dealt extensively with the MiddleEast. The U.S., however, is sure to try and stop the Saudisfrom making any such payments.   In the meantime, the test for the boycotting nations willbe to maintain their resolve in the face of high oil prices.Over time, Mr. Hussein is likely to find a way to sell someof his oil to energy-hungry nations. Indeed, without theformation of an effective international naval blockade, theembargo almost certainly will leak as oil prices rise. &quot;Thereare always cheaters,&quot; says Michael Ameen, a Houstonconsultant who formerly worked for Mobil Corp. &quot;There arealways people who say they're not going to buy, and then theyturn around and buy.&quot;   The industrialized world, meanwhile, is going to be badlyhurt by the oil-price increase resulting from the embargo.&quot;It will slow the rate of growth considerably in Europe andJapan, although they can probably avoid recession,&quot; saysRobert Hormats, vice chairman of Goldman Sachs International.&quot;In the U.S., however, if oil prices stay at these levels,it's probably impossible to avoid recession.&quot;   Japan is the nation most dependent on imported oil. But itis in some ways the best-positioned to deal with a priceincrease -- thanks to the energy-conservation measures andindustrial restructuring that have taken place in the pastdecade. The U.S., on the other hand, has been less aggressivein reducing its dependence on imported oil. Moreover, the oilprice spike comes at a particularly bad time for the U.S.,because its economy is so weak.   The U.S. has been hoping to ease the pain of a jump in oilprices by convincing Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates,Venezuela, Nigeria and Ecuador to produce more oil.   Venezuela's President Perez promised Mr. Quayle to helpBrazil, which has been receiving large quantities of Iraqioil. And he said Venezuela will do everything it can to keepthe price of oil at the $21-a-barrel price agreed to recentlyby the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.   John Easton, assistant energy secretary for internationalaffairs, will represent the Bush administration at the IEAmeeting in Paris. The U.S. has 590 million barrels of oil inits reserve, while Japan has 140 million barrels and Germany100 million barrels. Those three nations alone could make upfor the lost Iraqi and Kuwaiti oil for about 200 days.   Administration officials say they would prefer to act inconcert with other nations. &quot;Obviously using (the strategicreserve) unilaterally . . . wouldn't be nearly as beneficialfor American consumers as if we can arrange for coordinatinga multinational drawdown of stocks,&quot; said Linda Stuntz,deputy undersecretary of energy.   Ms. Stuntz said the U.S. Energy Department is preparing alist of options for President Bush to respond to the crisis.The list doesn't include any proposal for price controls, butdoes include such measures as encouraging industries toswitch from oil to natural gas, and encouraging conservationmeasures -- for example enforcing speed limits and increasingtire pressure in vehicles.   ---   Michel McQueen contributed to this article.</TEXT></DOC>
