No pickup.</NOTE><DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Bertha, the first hurricane of the 1990 Atlanticseason, churned along the Gulf Stream well east of the Carolinastoday after regaining strength temporarily lost during the night.   Born as a tropical depression off northeast Florida, Bertha grewquickly Saturday into a minimal hurricane with winds of 75 mph. Itdropped below the 74 mph hurricane threshold Sunday night, butregained hurricane status today after its winds intensified a bit.   At noon EDT today, Bertha had top sustained winds near 75 mphand was centered near latitude 35.3 north, longitude 67.4 west, or675 miles south-southwest of Halifax, Nova Scotia, said forecastersat the National Hurricane Center near Miami.   The storm was moving northeast near 13 mph and was expected tostay at the same strength, course and speed through early Tuesday,said forecaster Miles Lawrence.   Earlier, Bertha kicked up the surf along Carolina beaches andsent gusts up to about 45 mph toward Bermuda.   But forecasters said that because it was already edgingnortheastward toward the open Atlantic when it was born, it wasnever much of a threat.   ``It's mainly a concern to marine interests at the presenttime,'' forecaster Hal Gerrish said.   He said Bertha could reach the Canadian provinces of Nova Scotiaand Newfoundland by Wednesday or Thursday.   Tropical Storm Arthur, which peaked with 70 mph winds Thursdaybut quickly lost strength over the central Caribbean, haddissipated by late Saturday.</TEXT></DOC>
