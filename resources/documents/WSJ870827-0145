The government set an April 1, 1988, deadline for the five newly formed financial regulatory bodies, called self-regulating organizations, to authorize investment firms to do business.    The government originally planned to have all firms authorized by Jan. 1, according to industry sources. Delays in drafting and approving regulations for the financial organizations slowed the process.    &quot;This is still a very demanding timetable,&quot; said Corporate Affairs Minister Francis Maude. He said investment firms must be prepared to register with one of the regulatory bodies by year-end to receive authorization by the target date.    But Mr. Maude conceded that the authorization procedure could be postponed again. &quot;It's not entirely in our hands,&quot; he said. &quot;Many people play a part.&quot;    The Financial Intermediaries and Brokers Regulatory Association, the body that will regulate firms giving investment advice to individuals, said it hoped it would be able to meet the government's deadline. &quot;We're not saying it's going to be easy,&quot; said Fiona Monro, a spokeswoman for the association, &quot;but we believe the timetable is practicable.&quot; The association will be particularly hard-pressed to meet the target date because it must register as many as 15,000 investment advisers.    Investor protection has become increasingly important as the number of shareholders in Britain has surged in recent years, in part through the government's sale of state-owned businesses.    The Securities Association, a regulatory body comprising the former London Stock Exchange, said in a statement it welcomed the government's announcement because it &quot;helps remove some of the uncertainties facing firms in making their plans to cope with the new regulatory framework.&quot; Other regulatory bodies will govern investment managers, futures brokers and dealers, and life insurance companies.    The core of the Financial Services Act, passed by Parliament in November, is the requirement that investment firms either be authorized by regulatory bodies to do business or seek an exemption. Failure to do either will be a criminal offense. The government earlier implemented other provisions of the act, including one giving investigators greater powers to gather information in insider-trading cases.    Further delays in approving the regulatory bodies' rulebooks could scuttle the timetable. The regulations must first be reviewed by the Securities and Investments Board, the government's watchdog agency. Then the government will review them to determine if the regulatory bodies have undermined competition through measures designed to bolster investor protection. Delays in this review process apparently forced the government to postpone implementation of the authorization process.    The government now hopes the rules will be approved and the regulatory bodies formally established by year-end. Investment firms will then be required to seek authorization with a regulatory body.    Firms that have registered with the appropriate regulatory body by a fixed date -- now targeted for early January -- will be given interim authorization to do business even if their application has not been approved by the regulatory body by April 1. </TEXT></DOC>
