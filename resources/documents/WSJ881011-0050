It was the moment of inspiration Mr. Skier had been waiting for.    He wrote a program that makes laptop cursors larger, named it the No-Squint Laptop Cursor and introduced it at a software convention last month. It has become an instant hit at $39.95. &quot;This is a product that people are grabbing me by the lapels to get,&quot; Mr. Skier says. First-year sales, he estimates, could easily top $100,000.    Succeeding in the crowded, boisterous personal-computer software business isn't easy. The growth of companies such as Microsoft Corp. and Lotus Development Corp. into corporate giants with lots of resources has made it difficult for newcomers to get attention. But as Mr. Skier's experience shows, little guys still can thrive by finding and exploiting niches ignored by industry behemoths. &quot;I'm like little barberfish that go into jaws of big fish and clean their teeth,&quot; Mr. Skier says. &quot;I get morsels that are too little for the big fish.&quot;    Niche marketing is a good strategy for small businesses in any industry, but startup software companies have raised it to an art. PC users can find software to retrieve accidentally erased data, check spelling, write checks, draw charts, send memos, figure out income taxes. &quot;The last thing I want to be in&quot; are areas dominated by big companies such as spreadsheet or word-processing software, says Mark Eppley, president of Traveling Software Inc. His company makes a variety of niche programs, including Battery Watch, which tells the amount of time before a laptop computer battery runs down.    Some companies learned the hard way. A few years ago, many newcomers tried to take on industry stalwarts by offering better spreadsheets, data bases and word processors. Most failed because of entrenched companies' name recognition and marketing clout.    Software start-ups in niches also can go bust, too. The biggest problem is failure to get shelf space at computer stores. Mr. Skier's SkiSoft Publishing Corp. could get retailers like 47th Street Computer in New York to carry his No-Squint software because he is well known in the industry, but most software entrepreneurs have to sell by mail order, a far tougher task. And some niches are so small that they have limited growth prospects. Only about 10% of several thousand software companies have sales of more than $1 million a year, estimates Jeffrey Tarter, publisher of SoftLetter, an industry newsletter.    But many small fry not only survive, they thrive. &quot;The classic way is to find a niche and dominate it,&quot; says Mr. Tarter. &quot;Pretax profits can run 30% to 40%. There's not a lot of overhead.&quot;    Like SkiSoft's cursor program, the best niche products are solutions -- often obvious but overlooked -- to nagging problems. &quot;Anything that makes life easier and increases productivity, whoopee!&quot; says Bob Orbach, director of business development at 47th Street Computer. But coming up with ideas can be harder than it sounds.    Battery Watch was conceived, for example, when the battery on Mr. Eppley's laptop computer ran out 30 minutes into a nine-hour plane trip. Paul Funk created a niche after he recognized that users of the best-selling Lotus 1-2-3 spreadsheet couldn't print spreadsheets with lots of columns because printer paper was too narrow. His solution? Sideways, a program that prints data sideways -- or lengthwise -- on long sheets of computer paper. Funk Software Inc., which had about $5 million in 1987 sales, recently introduced another product, Allways, that permits more appealing printing of 1-2-3 documents.    Similarly, Michael Weiner's first product was born of his frustration that WordStar, a word-processing program, couldn't print in &quot;proportional facing&quot; -- with m's wider than i's, for example. So he wrote a program that enabled WordStar to do it. That product is long gone (WordStar incorporated the feature into an upgraded version), but his company, Microlytics Inc., has thrived by becoming one of the leading sellers of thesaurus and spelling-checker software. Its sales rose to nearly $4 million last year from $500,000 in 1985.    His latest hit is GOfer, which searches for and retrieves data computer users can't find. &quot;The fact that I couldn't find stuff was annoying,&quot; Mr. Weiner says. &quot;I build products I want and need myself.&quot;    Sometimes niches turn into big product categories. &quot;There are many cases of people who have bootstrapped themselves to substantial success from money in a savings account,&quot; says Kenneth A. Wasch, executive director of Software Publishers Association, an industry trade group.    Desktop publishing, for example, has gone from being a minor niche to one of the industry's fastest-growing categories.    Aldus Corp., which pioneered desktop publishing, is expected by analysts to post sales of around $70 million for this year -- up from just $2.2 million in 1985.    Another niche that is still small but could boom is forms software, which enables users to fill out and print everything from expense accounts to inventory sheets to purchase orders with a personal computer. Within five years, says Mr. Tarter of SoftLetter, no one in corporate America will fill out forms on typewriters.    One of the leaders in this emerging niche, FormWorx Corp., expects sales this year of about $2 million, up from $700,000 last year and $60,000 in 1985. When its founders, Ming Lee and Vivek Basrur, went looking for money a few years ago to finance their start-up, they visited many venture capitalists -- and got not a penny. They started with their own savings plus $20,000 from friends and relatives.    FormWorx discovered the niche by keeping in close touch with customers. The company initially sold graphics software, but the market was crowded. FormWorx refined and improved its program after many customers said they used it to make forms, not charts or graphs. &quot;All the formal market research in the world wouldn't give us the answers we get by listening to customers,&quot; Mr. Basrur says.    Few retailers carried FormWorx in the first couple of years, so it was sold almost exclusively by mail order. But after building a following, FormWorx hired a sales manager in January. The move paid off when Egghead Discount Software Inc., one of the nation's leading retailers, featured FormWorx in an ad recently.    Of course, as a niche grows, competition usually increases. Several big companies plan to enter the forms software business, Mr. Tarter of SoftLetter notes, threatening the half-dozen or so smaller companies in the field. &quot;In a highly volatile market like software,&quot; Mr. Basrur says, &quot;you're never out of the woods.&quot;    ---                  The Software Industry    Top 100 companies' 1987 sales, in millions of dollars                 Top 3          $1,120                 Next 22        $795.6                 Remaining 75   $415.4   Three big software makers dominate.
