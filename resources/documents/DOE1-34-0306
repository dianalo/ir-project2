At first, attention had mainlybeen directed towards the fission products released during atmosphericnuclear testing. Since that time there has been a marked change in theformulation of the problem: the use of radioactive pharmaceutics hasincreased considerably, all around Austria a large number of nuclearpower stations have started operation, and others are under construction;in addition, the measurement of natural radionuclides is gaining moreand more in importance. In consideration of these aspects, the Austrianmonitoring network was reorganized from 1978 onwards by the present RadiationProtection Department of the Federal Office for the Environment, andnew collection and measurement methods have been introduced. A surveyis given of the state of the monitoring network, the aims are explainedand an outline of future developments planned is given.</TEXT></DOC>
