 With Drupa having taken place only weeksbefore and with several other shows earlier this spring, many of the vendorsexhibited refinements and enhancements, but few had completely new products.andO;Thus, the real story was the jockeying for position among system vendors aswe head into the '90s.andM;These developments occurred on several levels, involving even the mighty, asthe names Atex, Kodak and IBM reverberated around the hall throughout theshow, and as Du Pont, Crosfield and Camex followed suit.andP;  Besides these,though, there were deals involving other key players in the market.andO;Information International obtained marketing rights to the Macintosh-basedproducts of Concept Publishing.andP;  Computer Peripheral Sciences (CPS) signed amarketing and financial arrangement with Brighton Publishing Systems of thecomputer industry.andM;We'll start with the headliners: the Atex-ERM-Kodak announcement and thefirst showing of the new Du Pont collection of companies under one roof.andO;We'll follow with some other highlights in this issue and provide an indepthreview of the rest of the show in our next issue.andM;Atex-IBM: planning a new startandM;The Atex-IBM announcement probably got the lion's share of the attention ofshow visitors, many of whom spent hours discussing it in the aisles and atafter-hours cocktail parties.andP;  As our readers are undoubtedly aware from aspecial bulletin we mailed to subscribers and from the story in our lastissue, IBM has agreed to enter into arrangements with Eastman Kodak that willprovide funds and direction from IBM aimed at moving Atex into the future.andM;Among other things, Atex will move its systems onto standard IBM hardware,rather than running on the assorted DEC, Sun and IBM hardware that currentlyis in use.andP;  Accomplishing this transformation is expected to take at least acouple of years, during which time Atex's Applications Servers, based on DECJ11 computers, will be phased out, with customer support continuing for up toseven years.andM;Although it was clear from the announcement of this deal that IBM willprovide a significant amount of funds for development, both parties statedthat IBM would make no equity investment in Atex, which would remain whollyowned by Eastman Kodak.andM;Agreement clarifications.andP;  The show provided an opportunity for Atex and IBMto clarify certain points of the agreement beyond the details included in ourspecial bulletin.andP;  For example, Atex views its relationship with IBM as oneof project partners where Atex will contract with IBM for development help ona project-by-project basis.andP;  IBM will take a major role in helping tointerface with third-party products and will help in porting software to IBMplatforms, such as the new RS/6000 RISC machine.andM;Atex views product definition as an Atex function, although it also fallswithin IBM's domain.andP;  For example, even in the case of the Los Angeles Times,where IBM was already a partner, Atex will decide the functional andarchitectural makeup of the delivered product.andP;  From an engineeringperspective, Atex looks to IBM for help in porting its software to newplatforms, such as moving its Total Publishing Environment (TPE) and ClassPage to the 6000.andP;  It also is looking to IBM for money and development peoplein future projects (such as a new editorial system).andM;Some of the new product definitions have already taken shape.andP;  Unix has beenchosen as the operating system at both the terminal level and at theserver-mainframe level of the new classified system (which will be installedat the LA Times).andP;  We were a bit surprised to hear that Atex also views Unixas the likely operating system for its next-generation editorial system (atthe user terminal level).andM;In another decision, Atex has decided not to market the Archetype display adsystem, after securing the rights to the product at ANPA last year.andP;  Insteadit will offer an open platform--&quot;customer choice&quot;--approach to display admakeup.andP;  In fact, Pat Sorn of Atex spent a lot of time at the show discussingAtex's open system specifications with several potential interfacingpartners, such as suppliers of display ad terminals, picture desks andgraphic subsystems.andP;  This is a welcome change from decisions only a few yearsago when Atex tried to produce nearly all the components of a completenewspaper system.andM;IBM also pledged to offer completely open systems.andP;  Obviously this raises thequestion of Macintoshes in the IBM future.andP;  Atex users were emphatic thatsystems without Macs would not be viewed positively.andP;  IBM has said yes to theintegration of Macs, but the jury is still out on to what degree they will beintegrated.andP;  Stay tuned !andP;  It was also decided that Archetype will not beused for newspaper layout (a possibility that had never been announcedpublicly).andP;  At ANPA, Atex launched its new PC version of the R2 layoutproduct, running the layout software in the PC in emulation mode.andP;  For therecord, Atex also announced the formal release of TPE on the Vax and Sunplatforms to take place on July 1.andP;  This becomes an interesting situationbecause IBM will now push to get this product quickly over to an IBM platform(6000 workstation), at which time it can begin phasing out the Vax/Sunconfiguration.andM;Currently, six sites are committed to the TPE product, all of which will beconverted by Atex to IBM gear at no charge.andP;  For new customers contemplatingTPE, Atex will encourage them to lease hardware until the IBM configurationis complete.andP;  But questions now arise about how well TPE is suited to ayet-undefined new IBM/Atex front end.andP;  With a brand-new front end, takingfull advantage of the latest technology, will TPE still be developed alongthe same architectural and functional lines that were suited to the intimateintegration of 12-year-old J11 systems?andM;Marketing help.andP;  From the marketing side, Atex views IBM as providing anadditional sales force, with its most important function perhaps openingdoors in newspapers where Atex wouldn't otherwise have had a natural entry.andO;But IBM also will help to define products and product strategies, althoughdetails of those functions haven't been announced.andM;Atex employees speak.andP;  From the Atex employees' viewpoint, the agreement withIBM comes as a blessing.andP;  As upbeat as these loyal workers have been the lastfew years, everyone we talked to believes that IBM will &quot;breathe new life&quot;into Atex and rescue it from the course that had evolved in the years ofKodak direction.andP;  Without targeting Kodak as the culprit in past failures,the Atex crew is now looking forward to new opportunities and competitiveproduct offerings-thanks to its new partner.andM;Some of the European employees were a little more reserved about theagreement.andP;  Part of this may stem from the fact that IBM has formal andinformal agreements with several European suppliers (different suppliers indifferent countries).andP;  It is still unclear how this will fit with IBM as adirect supplier (potentially competing with the same suppliers they have beencooperating with).andP;  So, from this perspective, the agreement could producepositive results for the Europeans as well-but for now they are taking a&quot;wait and see&quot; attitude.andM;IBM employees.andP;  From the IBM camp, we found a refreshing disposition, onemuch more open than we would expect from Big Blue.andP;  These people presented asincere wish to be a major player in the newspaper business.andP;  We have heardthis before from big companies (including Kodak), but we noticed asignificant difference this time.andP;  Many of the IBM people who are involved inthe agreement have been taking an unusually active role in the industry.andP;  Wegot a hint of this when IBM sent 10 people to our newspaper tutorial lastNovember.andP;  But they also were very active at ANPA, meeting with customers,newspaper groups, other suppliers and the media.andP;  Without question, there isa core of IBM executives who have demonstrated a willingness to get ink ontheir hands and to get involved to the level where they look more likeentrepreneurs than what most people would expect IBM people to look like.andM;This didn't come without a hint of doubt and without the realization thatthere is a risk.andP;  A few IBM people acknowledged the risk and that theycouldn't see to the end of the tunnel.andP;  But for the most part, all were infavor of the plunge into the newspaper system business and welcomed theobvious challenge.andM;Users aren't so sure.andP;  Most other people looked at the deal from their ownperspectives and offered opinions both on the topic of what it meant to themand what it would mean for the industry.andP;  Here is a brief summary of what weheard.andM;From users in general, we heard more negative comments than positive feelingsabout the changes.andP;  We believe a lot of this had more to do with theperception of what the agreement will eventually turn into than with what wasactually announced.andM;Prior to the show, word had been leaked (published in the AtlantaConstitution) that IBM was buying a portion of Atex.andP;  IBM said there wasabsolutely no truth to any of these rumors and that IBM was not taking anequity position in Atex.andP;  But regardless of the disclaimers, people believedwhat they wanted to believe.andP;  Almost universally, the people we talked tofelt that this was only the beginning of what would amount to a partial orfull ownership role on the part of IBM.andM;People basing their opinions on this assumption-which, again, was deniedvehemently by IBM-discussed what this would mean to their newspapers, tonewspaper groups, and to the industry at large.andM;Most of the non-Atex users were upset that IBM was about to &quot;throw itsweight&quot; into the relatively small newspaper market.andP;  Since most of thesenewspapers had purchased (or were about to purchase) equipment from smaller,independent vendors, they felt that IBM's dominant presence as a supplier ofend-user applications would make it difficult for other independent suppliersto compete and to offer creative solutions.andP;  They thought it nearly ruled outthe thought of new entrepreneurs entering the business with fresh andinnovative ideas.andM;A similar message had been presented by Jim Lennane at the Seybold Seminarsin March when he said that the big guys, with their very deep pockets, wouldstifle innovation and discourage the entrepreneur, which he felt was theproven life-blood of the industry.andM;A representative of one large newspaper made it very clear in saying, &quot;Wedon't want or need `Big Blue' messing up our industry&quot; (at theapplication/end-user level).andM;Farewell to J11.andP;  Some users felt they were about to be abandoned or had beendeceived, thinking that their J11 computers would last forever and be thefoundation of Atex pagination-a view Atex has fostered for some time (much tothe frustration of this publication and to many supporters of fourth-wavetechnology).andP;  That all future development will take place on IBM hardware-notDEC-and will require investment in new equipment to take full advantage offuture offerings was not easy for many of these people to swallow.andP;  But,realistically, most of these users had to know that their 12-year-old systemsweren't really the best foundation for full pagination and would eventuallyhave to be replaced.andP;  This appears to be more a case of &quot;reality hurts&quot; thanof newspapers being deceived by their vendor.andM;But Atex has to share in much of the blame for this.andP;  And over the long run,we feel that when the dust settles, users may view this as a blessing indisguise.andM;Newspaper groups.andP;  From some of the larger newspaper groups, we heard adifferent side to this story.andP;  Many of these groups expressed the opinionthat they have been following Atex (as well as other large suppliers) withouttoo much concern for what other vendors were doing.andP;  In other words, theylooked first (and many cases last) to Atex for solutions and for futuredirections, almost with blind faith.andP;  Few seriously considered replacingtheir system-let alone replacing their system vendor-as long as their systemvendor made it relatively painless for them to continue producing theircurrent products and that vendor (Atex in this case) held out hope for thefuture and for the ultimate goal of full pagination.andP;  Many of these peoplewent home from ANPA resigned (many for the first time) to the need toevaluate completely and objectively the status of their current front-endsystems.andP;  Knowing that they will eventually have to replace them-even if theycontinue with Atex-puts a different light on how and when they march into thefuture and progress toward modem systems.andM;Several of the large newspaper groups offered the opinion that they now sawmany fewer reasons to continue adding to their very old Atex systems, andalmost no reason to buy complete front-end systems from Atex again.andP;  Onegroup executive put it this way: &quot;When IBM/Atex develops a new front-endsystem, we will evaluate it like any other new vendor's product in thismarket.&quot;andM;Futher complications? Finally, there were people who felt that the currentarrangement will complicate further an already complicated company andperhaps result in delaying decision making and product development.andP;  Manyfelt that getting clear direction, decision making and related productimplementation was difficult enough with the Atex/Kodak management.andP;  Theyfear that adding IBM to this equation could significantly complicate andfurther delay progress at a time when most of them feel Atex has to getmoving and catch up with its competition.andM;To counter this opinion, IBM is pledging manpower and money.andP;  But, hereagain, people aren't sure that more people and more money are really theanswer.andP;  Much of this feeling appears to hinge on the newspapers' fear ofdual &quot;parents&quot; for Atex.andP;  Those same users seem to feel that although a totalIBM ownership isn't in itself ideal, it is far better than having only one ofIBM's feet in the water.andM;The positive view.andP;  Although we started by discussing the fears expressed bymany users, we don't mean to imply that there weren't positive opinions aswell.andP;  In general, positive views came from three categories of users: thereal Atex loyalists, the IBM supporters and Europeans.andM;Atex has a long list of very loyal customers who have always looked on thebright side of any Atex movement.andP;  Among these arc newspapers that wereecstatic when Kodak came into the picture and now are fully supportive of theIBM arrangement.andP;  For the most part, they are fully committed to Atex, andexpect good to come from any relationship Atex can muster.andM;Several other users (the New York Times and the Los Angeles Times inparticular) have invested heavily, not only in Atex, but also in IBM.andP;  HavingIBM take a more active role in the direction of Atex and its products came asa strong positive sign that IBM will improve things.andP;  The development of thenext-generation system for the New York Times has been dragging on for years,and the prospect of IBM's direct involvement is a hope to accelerate theproject and finally put the front-end portion of the system to rest.andP;  In thecase of the Los Angeles Times-which signed a letter of intent for a newIBM/Atex classified system more than a year ago and hasn't progressed to afull contract yet-the announcement reinforces its initial decision to get IBMinvolved.andP;  As one executive put it, although this is a positive step, it isnot that much of a change because it already had IBM's commitment for theproject.andM;Many European users we talked with were more positive about the agreementthan were their U.S.andP;  counterparts.andP;  We believe that part of this stems fromthe greater loyalty generally felt by European users.andP;  Part of it also maystem from the anticipated increase in support users will get from the IBMrelationship (something not looked upon as a current need in the U.S.).andM;Competitors' views.andP;  There was no question about the opinions of Atex'scompetitors in the system business.andP;  They were elated by the news.andP;  Therepresentative of one company that currently feeds off the Atex customer basebegged us to quote him as saying, &quot;In my wildest dreams, I couldn't haveasked for anything better for my company.&quot;andM;This sentiment was echoed by most of tile system suppliers, who share theview that a portion of the Atex customer base is now up for grabs.andP;  None ofthem feel that they are going to take the Atex customer base by storm, and noone believes the Atex customer base will abandon Atex in a mass exodus.andO;However, with 700 Atex customers now contemplating their next move, many ofthese system vendors feel that some users will begin seriously consideringreplacing their systems, as opposed to the current approach of makingincremental upgrades.andM;It would take only a small percentage of these customers to opt for thisalternative to accelerate new system sales and to revive a sinking systembusiness.andM;Atex estimates that one-third of its customers would need significant&quot;upgrades in order to get continued support under maintenance contracts underthe new agreement with IBM.andP;  Since these upgrades could potentially cost asmuch as a brand-new system, this is the primary target of the other systemvendors trying to break into the Atex customer camp.andM;Du Pont/Camex integration strategyandM;The other large newspaper system vendor in the news was Du Pont, theproprietor of the Camex and Crosfield newspaper businesses.andP;  This was DuPont's first newspaper show since it starting putting together the pieces ofits acquisitions under Camex's direction: Crosfield (with its Hastech and CSIoperations), Camex (with its Intertext and NSSE businesses) and ImagiTex.andM;It demonstrated its existing products, announced full support for PostScriptoutput from its Camex Breeze (Sun) and Ad Stylist (Macintosh) display adsystems, and discussed progress on its product line of the future-theWhirlwind system being developed for the Houston Chronicle.andM;Strategy.andP;  In several ways, the challenges for Du Pont at ANPA were quitedifferent from those of the new Atex/IBM alliance.andP;  With so many companies tobe integrated, and so many products with overlapping functionality, thechallenge for Du Pont was to present a clear product strategy and to appearas a unified, single entity.andP;  That was an unenviable task, one that wouldhave been difficult to achieve even for a veteran in the systembusiness-which Du Pont isn't.andM;In that perspective, it may not be fair to make a final pronouncement on thesuccess of Du Pont's effort.andP;  Rather, the show perhaps should be viewed onlyas the beginning of a long process, the results of which won't be known forsome time.andP;  But at the same time, we do want to report those beginnings, bothin its direction and in the image that is being shaped.andM;Platform agility.andP;  The long-run approach centers on &quot;platform agility,&quot; aterm Du Pont uses to encompass the idea of portable software running on avariety of hardware platforms.andP;  In contrast to Atex, which will focus almostexclusively on IBM hardware in the future, Du Pont has pledged to supportSun, DEC and IBM platforms for at least parts of its systems.andM;Du Pont and Camex used ANPA (and a DEC users' meeting held in conjunctionwith the show) to announce their strategy of platform agility, although, aswe all know, declaring oneself to be agile isn't necessarily the same thingas demonstrating one's agility.andP;  While in theory it is admirable to be openand portable, to gain the confidence of a skeptical public requires gettingthe software to run on one platform first.andP;  Announcing anything beyond thatmay be viewed more as a distraction than as a benefit.andM;Moreover, in the short run, Du Pont projected itself as a company hanging onto products that aren't part of its future, as we will discuss in a moment,which contributes even more to the image of the company as anything but thetrim, focused, &quot;agile&quot; competitor it can and should be in the long run.andM;Whirlwind.andP;  Central to the idea of platform agility is the Camex Whirlwindproduct line, which is the foundation of Du Pont's future products.andO;Currently, Whirlwind, in its classified guise, is running on a Sun platform(for user terminals, file servers and the database).andP;  The latest timeframefor putting this system into live operation at Houston is still severalmonths away.andM;At the show, Camex signed a deal with DEC to port the product to a DECplatform with DEC doing much of the porting.andP;  This seems to fit the desire tobe platform agile.andM;The movement to DEC (and the fact that the Omega editorial system that Camexacquired from Hastech already runs on PCs) doesn't seem to be deterringHouston from wanting an editorial system on Sun terminals.andP;  It appears atthis stage that Houston will get its version of the editorial system (whichwe assume will now be based on the Omega project) on Sparcstations.andM;Omega.andP;  One of the real strong points in the Du Pont stable now appears to bethe long-awaited Omega editorial system (which Camex will call Whirlwind,which also is the name for the classified system).andP;  This was being developedby Crosfield/ Hastech at the time of the merger and has continued as the hopeof the future for its editorial offering.andP;  Fortunately for Camex, which hasstandardized on Sybase as its database, Omega runs on Sybase as well.andP;  Camexis now committed to offering the product under OS/2 and Unix at the terminallevel (using PCs, Sun and other workstations as user terminals).andP;  At the fileserver level, it is going to offer both Unix on Sun platforms and VMS on DECplatforms.andP;  The schedule for the initial editorial system delivery is thefirst quarter of 1991, at Westchester-Rockland Newspapers, a long-time betasite for Hastech.andM;The editorial system is currently based on OS/2.andP;  As a result, it has asimilar look to CText's editorial product including the use of messaging andmultiple windows to facilitate the editing process and a nice interactivehelp program).andP;  A shell has been written over OS/2 to give the product adesktop look-showing the user what directories, disks and systems currentlyare open.andP;  Beyond the typical third-generation editing features, this systemdoes an exceptional job in tracking stories through the entire editorialprocess-giving everyone involved a clear indication of when stories are sentand received.andP;  The product supports both a monospaced, interactive editorwith a dynamically updated depth counter and an optional full-WYSIWYG editor.andM;The product is far enough along to get an indication of how the directorystructure will work, although things such as selective directories accessingthe Sybase database are not implemented yet.andP;  An interesting outcome of theproject is a decision to use Acomp-the new Hastech/CSI compositionpackage-for the editorial system.andP;  But more interesting is the decision tostandardize on this package for all Camex products-including the Breeze.andP;  Anice feature of this language is the ability to effectively use compositiontags (a la SGML) for such things as heads, body text and captions.andM;Display ads.andP;  Camex is also progressing with its Mac-based display adproduct, called AdStylist.andP;  We tried to get a feeling for how Camex willposition AdStylist vs.andP;  its Sun-based Breeze.andP;  It seems to be split alongdatabase and graphic lines.andP;  Although the AdStylist product will supportgraphics, and although it will be tied into the full Sun-based Sybase graphicdatabase, the Mac will not have a separate configuration of its own.andP;  Inother words, there are no plans to offer a complete Mac-based display adsystem, including its own database.andP;  If Mac customers want a database, itwill be offered on Sun hardware-regardless of the user terminals.andM;One very positive sign out of Camex is its willingness to offer PostScriptoutput from its Breeze (and AdStylist) systems.andP;  Camex has been very vocal inits opinion that PostScript is not ready for the demands of real newspapers.andO;But although it still hasn't changed its opinion on this point, it realizesthat the demand from the customer is too hard to ignore, so it has decided tooffer a PostScript output driver for proofing or final output.andP;  It will beready sometime this summer.andP;  Newspapers wishing to buy Breeze display adsystems will not have to limit their viable typesetter choices to Camex's ownSuperSetter.andP;  An Autologic ICL driver for APS-6 typesetters also will be madeavailable shortly.andM;The short run.andP;  Whirlwind and the Breeze/AdStylist lines represent the futurefor Du Pont in this market.andP;  But over the short run, when Du Pont wants toget products into customers' hands, the emphasis will be on using whatever isavailable to fill the market needs that can be identified.andP;  The list ofavailable products includes many of the ones that were involved in the recentacquisitions.andM;One of the company's customers characterized the product offering as a&quot;Chinese menu of newspaper systems.&quot; That may be a bit unfair, but Du Pontdid inject a little ginseng into some of its products to extend their livesbeyond what might once have been envisioned.andM;There is nothing wrong with selling what you have, at least as long as peoplewant to buy it, although one consequence is that Du Pont continues to promotea vast array of products.andP;  A separate issue, though, is the changes indirection and delays in bringing new products to market that have hurt DuPont in its effort to establish itself as a forward-thinking, decisiveorganization.andM;The 2300/2400/2500.andP;  One of the &quot;revived&quot; products is the 2300 system-theproprietary editorial and classified system that Du Pont obtained when itacquired Crosfield/Hastech.andP;  In March, Du Pont had named the 2300 as aproduct that it wasn't going forward with-an ambiguous statement thatgenerally was interpreted as meaning that it wouldn't see much in the way ofnew developments.andM;But at Drupa and at ANPA, it demonstrated the PC Magician-a PC version of thestandard Magician terminal of the Hastech fine.andP;  Camex still doesn't see the2300 or the PC Magician as a bulwark of its failure, but it feels there arecustomers who want to buy new systems or would like to buy upgrades.andP;  A PCversion will at least give them a terminal they may be able to use in futuresystems.andP;  Whereas Atex is offering an up front rebate plan for newspapersbuying older products that currently are being phased out, Camex issupporting PCs that will have continuing life.andM;There is no change to the 2400 product line.andP;  Camex will continue to supportexisting users, but unlike the 2300, it will neither take new orders for itnor continue development (aside from minor items that fall into the categoryof fixing existing problems, not adding features).andM;The 2500 (Wizard product line) will be eliminated, as we reported earlier.andO;No new development will take place on these products.andP;  Du Pont will offer toswap AdWizards for its Breeze terminals.andP;  The primary development that wasanticipated by many Wizard users was the addition of full graphics, whichwill not take place.andP;  However, Du Pont will maintain the current installedbase of AdWizards and work out something with the two ClassWizardinstallations.andM;No NewsWizards were ever installed (although the Baltimore Sun had committedto install some).andP;  This product will be canceled.andM;Intertext resurfaces.andP;  Another turnabout concerns the Intertext front-endeditorial and classified systems that Camex acquired several years ago.andO;Camex feels that market conditions have changed and the product has beensufficiently improved to make the editorial system-which it stopped sellinglast fall-viable again.andP;  Although neither the editorial nor the classifiedsystem was a big seller, Camex will keep them on the market for theforeseeable future.andP;  Part of the sales effort will focus on the EditorControlled Pagination program that can be installed in conjunction with othervendors' front-end editorial systems.andP;  One such system in use in Halifax,Nova Scotia, in a DEC environment and another is being installed in IdahoFalls with a CSI system.andM;This isn't part of Du Pont's platform agility program, but the philosophy isto sell what works while it works-and while there is no other system to sell.andO;Whether Intertext-and the other existing products--can last until Whirlwindis fully developed remains to be seen.andP;  This is one of the challenges Du Pontfaces-to show some results from its new strategy before its marketableproducts get too long in the tooth.andM;Atex/IBM and Du Pont/Camex: a contrast We now have a clear separation betweenthe independent vendors-SII, Dewar, CText, Cybergraphic and CompuText-and thelarge corporate giants, such as the Atex/IBM alliance and Du Pont.andP;  But therealso appears to be a difference in strategy between the IBM camp and the DuPont camp.andP;  With the IBM agreement comes a message from Atex that the past isnow officially acknowledged to be over, finished.andP;  The long-overdue decisionto concentrate on the future, rather than on upgrades, is at hand.andP;  Byletting its customers know how the J11 fits in the company's future, Atex hasmade it possible for these customers to plan their future on the basis of abrand-new architecture that will better facilitate the many different optionsfor which newspapers are now crying-including the ellusive dream of completepagination.andM;It doesn't appear that Camex is willing to go quite this far.andP;  Instead ofputting all of its effort into the future (and therefore concentratingeverything on Whirlwind classified and editorial), it has decided to keep theolder 2300 and Intertext systems alive-including development support-untd ithas an adequate replacement to sell.andM;This solves some short-term goals of having front-end systems to sell todaythat are old but proven products.andP;  But, as Atex learned, it is a deadly gamethat sooner or later has to come to an end and may only serve to prolong thetime it will take to develop a solid, modem architecture for new buyers.andO;Over time, the customer base-and the market in general-grows weary of changesin direction and slow progress.andM;When we asked Du Pont what it would do differently from Kodak to assure itssuccess in preparing for the future, we were told that Du Pont would learnfrom Kodak's mistakes.andP;  It is too early to pass judgment on this matter, butas we look at Du Pont's current direction, we have a strange feeling thatwe've been down this road before.andM;DEC vs.andP;  IBMandM;With all the acquisitions, mergers and alliances, one key battleground hasbeen somewhat forgotten.andP;  During the second wave of newspaper technology, ata time when generic computers were programmed to perform handamp;j and producepunched tape for typesetters, IBM was a significant player with its 1130computer and its FDP cold-type composition language.andM;As we passed into the third generation of equipment in the mid-seventies andearly eighties, IBM all but disappeared from the front-end system businessand DEC took over as the dominant player.andP;  DEC played the game on both sidesof the street-first as a supplier of end-user editorial and classifiedsystems (TMS, EMS and CMS systems) and second (and more important) as thedominant OEM supplier of minicomputers to companies such as CSI, Atex andHastech.andP;  Since that time, DEC has slowly disappeared from the newspaperindustry: first, as it made a conscious move to depart as an end-usersupplier of application solutions, and, second, as it lost OEM business toother suppliers such as Apple, IBM (and PC clone makers) and Sun.andM;As the fourth wave moves into the nineties, DEC is left with many fewervendors offering solutions based on its hardware, and no one exclusivelyoffering DEC solutions.andP;  This comes at a time when IBM has decided to take agiant step directly into the newspaper field.andM;So as IBM prepares to sell directly into newspapers, it will find a worldfilled with older DEC hardware, customers who by and large like the DEChardware they were using, but very few viable vendors offering DEC solutions.andO;Is this a gift from above, a blunder on the part of DEC, or brilliantstrategy on the part of IBM? Based on the theory of alternating generations,we can only assume that DEC is planning its strategy to dominate the fifthwave and IBM is already planning its exit strategy.andP;  Maybe together theycould both give us a glimpse into the future.andM;So, where is the system business today? Someone asked that wise old systemguru in the sky how to make a small fortune in the newspaper system business.andO;His reply: &quot;Start with a large fortune and buy an existing system company!&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
