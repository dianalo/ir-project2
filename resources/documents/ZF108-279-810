Cain and Michael E. Perie,two top officials in the Advanced Automation System program.andM;Cain, formerly director of the FAA's Automation Service, became the deputy toMartin T. Pozesky, FAA's deputy associate administrator for National AirspaceSystem programs, said Dick Stafford, an FAA spokesman.andM;Perie, formerly deputy director of FAA's Automation Service, keeps his job asAAS program manager while assuming the deputy director position vacated byCain, Stafford said.andM;Also, the FAA has created a new executive directorship position.andP;  The newexecutive director, John Burt, will be in charge of overall acquisitions forthe agency, including the AAS project, Stafford said.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
