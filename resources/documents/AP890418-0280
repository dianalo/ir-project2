The cable, no bigger than a garden hose, stretches 8,271 milesfrom California, through Hawaii, splitting in the western Pacificinto legs that travel to Guam and Japan.   Pacific Link vastly increases the capacity for communicationacross the Pacific, which is sometimes called the ocean ofAmerica's future.   Instead of driving a golden spike, the builders of the $700million cable marked its completion with a video teleconferencebetween Japan and the boardroom of the New York Stock Exchange.   ``The distance between the two countries has become shorter,''Shiro Uramatsu, executive vice president of the Tokyo StockExchange, said from the Japanese end of the hookup.   ``We now have a new base, a new plateau'' for communicationsservices, John Berndt, president of International CommunicationsServices for American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co., said in New York.   The completion of Pacific Link comes just four months aftercompletion of the first fiber-optic cable across the Atlantic,TAT-8, which was inaugurated with a video speech by author andfuturist Isaac Asimov.   Fiber links will now stretch most of the way around the world,competing with satellites for the business of carrying phone calls,computer traffic and video conferences. Satellites are still usedfor television.   Unlike traditional copper cables, fiber-optic cables carryinformation in pulses of laser light. The single new cable will beable to carry 40,000 phone calls at a time across the Pacific,compared with less than 1,000 for the two copper cables already inservice combined.   ATandamp;T owns 35 percent of the cable. Kokusai Denshin Denwa,Japan's international phone company, owns 23 percent. There are 30partners in all, including MCI Communications Corp. and US SprintCommunications Co., as well as phone companies in Australia,Brunei, Canada, France, West Germany, Hong Kong, South Korea, NewZealand, the Philippines, Singapore, Spain, Taiwan, and Britain.   Laying fiber across deep oceans required some specialconsiderations. Surfers had to be moved aside at Hawaii's MakahaBeach to make room for a dinghy that brought the cable ashore.Sharks are attracted to the cables, so they had to be sheathed insteel to a depth of about 8,500 feet. That makes those sectionsabout the thickness of a man's fist.   The trans-Atlantic cable has suffered three partial outages inits brief life, two caused by damage from fishing trawlers on theFrench leg and one caused by an electrical short on the Britishleg, said ATandamp;T spokesman Rick Wallerstein.   The Pacific Link leaves the West Coast at Point Arena, about 100miles north of San Francisco. After its split in the westernPacific, the southern leg goes to Guam and the northern touchesland in Chikura, Japan.   Phone traffic between the United States and Japan is growingabout 20 percent a year, Wallerstein said. Worldwide internationalphone traffic is growing about 15 percent a year, a figure thatincludes the Japan growth, he said.</TEXT></DOC>
