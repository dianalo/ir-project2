A congressional aide compares auditors to InspectorClouseau, the detective of &quot;Pink Panther&quot; fame who trips overevidence but misses the crime. An academic suggests auditorsaren't needed because the steps they must take to spotmanagement fraud cost more than the fraud. And a partner of amajor accounting firm concedes that &quot;independent auditorshave long since outlived their usefulness.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   Accountants retort that the public doesn't understand howauditing works, fraud would be a lot worse without outsideauditors, and a lot of the protection auditors provide thepublic is never disclosed because of auditor-clientconfidentiality.   That raises a key question: Can a private-sectorprofession paid by the companies it polices really protectthe public if the profession must keep the negative news itfinds confidential?   The General Accounting Office, an arm of Congress,believes the best way to improve auditing is to strengthenrules, make auditors express opinions on companies' internalcontrols and make auditing mandatory for major financialinstitutions. Auditing currently isn't mandatory for banksunless they file financial reports with the Securities andExchange Commission.   Judging from a recent GAO report, which looked at 39 banksthat failed in 1989 and 1990, it's obvious that auditors haveto be a lot tougher. The major reasons for the failures: badmanagement of loan portfolios and poor operating management.   Thirty of the 39 failed banks had too liberal lendingpractices, poor loan documentation and credit analysis, andnonexistent or inadequate loan policies. At one bank, adirector and majority shareholder drained $255 million fromthe bank to a mortgage company he controlled. At another, adirector who also was a vice president and cashierdeliberately filed deceptive call reports with theregulators. In a third case, a large bank paid dividends onpreferred stock, even though it had to sell assets to coverits cash needs.   Four of the 39 had never been audited. And 23 of the 39weren't audited the year prior to failure. But even when thebanks were recently audited, the accountants followedgenerally accepted auditing standards, or GAAS, which the GAOfeels aren't adequate to uncover fraud.   The GAO notes that GAAS are extremely limited inevaluating a bank's internal controls. &quot;Management oradministrative controls, because they are not directlyrelated to financial statements, may not be tested by publicaccountants,&quot; the GAO report notes. And it is these that willshow whether the bank is complying with applicable laws andregulations.   The GAO says outside auditors should evaluate management'sassertions about internal controls. But some accountantsaren't sure they want this job, feeling it would increasetheir already high exposure to liability and malpracticelawsuits.   The GAO recommends that outside auditors review thequarterly call reports to regulators of the 50 biggest banks.These reports contain expanded financial data that couldalert the auditor to potential problems. The GAO alsosuggests that regulators periodically review the proceduresand working papers of the outside auditor. And it urgesCongress to pass legislation forcing auditors to tell theregulators if the bank fails to comply with laws andregulations relating to safety, soundness, prudent operationsand financial health.   Many of these suggestions are opposed by major accountingfirms, which believe they are too costly and may fail toachieve their desired purpose in the long run. Indeed, manyaccountants believe that such suggestions may erode theclient-auditor relationship, setting up a wall that would barthe auditor from uncovering deepseated company problems.   The GAO has been trying for years to get Congress tostrengthen the role of the outside auditor in reportingillegal acts. Last year a bill sponsored by Rep. Ron Wyden(D., Ore.) that would have forced outside auditors to reportmanagement fraud to the regulators gained acceptance fromsome accounting groups but died in a House committee. NowRep. Wyden is poised to introduce an even stronger bill. Butthe likelihood that it will pass isn't great, judging frompast experience.   Some skeptics wonder if scrutiny by independentaccountants can ever provide enough disclosure to protect thepublic. One of the most sensible ways to put steel in theaccountants' backbones would be to make the audit a realarm's-length procedure. The auditor could be paid from a poolof funds administered by a public or private-sector trusteeand funded by audited companies.   That's how the Financial Accounting Standards Board iscurrently financed. The chief rule-making body foraccountants is funded by a pool of money from accountingfirms, accounting and business organizations, andcorporations. (Corporations don't fund a specific accountingproject or they would appear to have a vested interest inthat project.)   Currently, if a U.S. bank doesn't like what its auditordoes, it can fire that auditor and hire another. It might bewiser to require that regulators must approve changes ofauditors by major financial institutions. In England, it'svery difficult for a bank to fire an outside auditor; inCanada, banks must rotate their auditors. (Rotation would betoo costly in the U.S., as it would require each new auditorto relearn the bank's financial setup.)   Also, for auditors to really spot management fraud, theyshould scrutinize the bank's management and administrationprocedures more deeply. This would entail boosting the costof the audit -- perhaps by as much as 50%. But the protectionto the public might be worth it.   As the public costs of saving the troubled banks andthrifts rise rapidly, the nation is frantic for quickanswers. But shifting the audit job to the government or aquasi-government agency, as some critics suggest, probablywouldn't solve the problem. Government bank examiners haveproved just as inept at detecting financial problems as havethe outside auditors.   We don't have to fire the independent auditors, but we doneed to give them enough real independence so they can fightfraud at financial institutions with powerful weapons -- andwe should do it soon.   ---   Mr. Berton covers accounting from the Journal's New Yorkbureau.</TEXT></DOC>
