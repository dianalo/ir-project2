In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, the Kaskel companies said they will seek to meet with Kansas City Southern executives and are considering pursuing a number of alternatives, including acquiring the company, seeking representation on its board and recommending a restructuring.    News of the filing sent Kansas City Southern's stock soaring. In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, it closed yesterday at $75.25 a share, up $6.25. The company, with 9.6 million shares outstanding as of Feb. 28, has an indicated market capitalization of about $720 million.    Kansas City Southern officials weren't immediately available for comment. But the filing may have taken them by surprise; individuals close to the Kaskel-led group said Mr. Kaskel had no discussions with Kansas City Southern before disclosing the stake.    The position in Kansas City Southern was apparently the first of its kind for Mr. Kaskel, whose family made a fortune building the Doral hotel chain and managing numerous New York apartment buildings.    The Kaskel companies, which hired the investment banking firm of Bear, Stearns andamp; Co. as an adviser, are understood to be seeking to diversify from their traditional real estate activities. In their filing, the companies said they selected Kansas City Southern because they believe it is undervalued.    Wall Street sources said the Kaskels are attracted by Kansas City Southern's 87%-owned DST Systems Inc. unit, a publicly traded concern that manages data processing systems for mutual funds. One individual close to the Kaskels called DST Systems &quot;a gem of a company.&quot; Healthy cash flows at the railroad unit, which operates between Kansas City and Gulf Coast ports, were also attractive, the individual added. The unit's shares jumped $4 to close at $48.50 each yesterday on the Big Board.    The individual familiar with the Kaskels said the companies would prefer a friendly acquisition. In the SEC filing, the Kaskel group said it also might consider &quot;entering into arrangements with third parties&quot; to either acquire control of the company or arrange the sale of some Kansas City Southern assets. The filing didn't specify what assets might be involved, but one individual close to the group said one option would be to spin off DST Systems to shareholders.    Kansas City Southern executives didn't return phone calls yesterday. As the pursued company, Kansas City Southern is experiencing a role reversal from last January, when it said it might make a bid for Southern Pacific Transportation Co., a unit of Chicago-based Santa Fe Southern Pacific Corp. No such bid has materialized. But a Kansas City Southern spokesman said last month the company is planning on making such a bid.    For the first six months, Kansas City Southern had net income of $4.3 million, or 44 cents a share, compared with a yearearlier net loss of $7.1 million, including a loss of $12 million from discontinued operations. Revenue rose 12% to $264.5 million.    Mr. Kaskel, whose personal fortune has been estimated at more than $275 million, runs an empire that grew to prominence in the 1930s under his father, developer Alfred Kaskel. Alfred Kaskel built the Doral chain, which consists of three big New York City hotels and a resort outside Miami, as well as apartment buildings that dot Connecticut, Chicago and New York. The principal property in New York is a 41-story Park Avenue building.    Howard Kaskel, 50 years old, breeds horses and operates a sprawling farm near Pawling, N.Y. In June, he watched as one of his horses won the prestigious Irish Derby. He also is a golfing enthusiast; one of his companies co-sponsors a Professional Golf Association tournament. </TEXT></DOC>
