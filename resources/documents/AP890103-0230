PLC agreed Tuesday to selloff most of its mineral operations for $4.32 billion and, in aseparate transaction, pay $3.57 billion to buy back more than halfthe 1.32 billion BP shares held by the government of Kuwait.   RTZ Corp. PLC, a mining company with global interests, said itagreed to buy the mineral operations, which includes operations inthe United States, Mexico, Brazil, Norway, Zimbabwe, South Africa,Australia, Papua New Guinea and Indonesia, for 2.4 billion pounds,or $4.32 billion.   The sale includes BP's biggest U.S. asset, Bingham Canyon inUtah, one of the world's largest open pit gold and copper mines,Frank Fisher, BP's director of external affairs in Salt Lake Cityconfirmed Tuesday. However, it does not include most of BP'sCanadian mineral assets.   The stock buy-back follows a British government order to theKuwaitis last month to reduce their BP holdings from 21.68 percentto under 10 percent within three years.   BP said it was buying 790 million shares from the KuwaitInvestment Office, the London-based investment arm of the Kuwaitigovernment, for 1.95 billion pounds, the equivalent of $3.57billion. The transaction is subject to approval by BP shareholders,the company said.   The British government's order to the Kuwaitis came after aruling in October by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission that thebig Kuwaiti holding could ``operate against the public interest''because of Kuwait's membership of the Organization of PetroleumExporting Countries.   BP chairman Sir Peter Walters said Tuesday that allowing such alarge stake in BP shares to remain in limbo ``for a period of up tothree years isn't in the interests of the company or itsshareholders.''   The Kuwait Investment Office built up its holding by buyingpartly paid BP stock in the months following the government's 7.2billion pound, or $13.2 billion, public offering of BP shares inOctober 1987.   The major sale by the Conservative government under its policy ofprivatization coincided with the stock market crash. The offering,which included the government's remaining 31.5 percent stake in BP,was seriously undersubscribed.   BP will pay the Kuwaitis 305 pence each for their shares,compared with a purchase price of 287 pence.   However, BP will effectively pay 247 pence a share because of taxcredits. BP shares rose as high as 259 pence on Tuesday'sannouncements, and its partly paid shares gained 10 pence to 157.5pence on the London Stock Exchange.   Meanwhile, RTZ shares rose 7 pence to 424 pence.   Walters said BP began negotiating the mineral sales in mid-1988,and said they were not undertaken to finance the share buy-back.   The minerals transaction also covers the Canadian-based QIT, theworld's leading producer of titanium dioxide; a 49 percent stake inAustralia's Olympic Dam copper, uranium, gold and silver mines, andSouth Africa's Richards Bay Minerals, a top producer of titaniumminerals, iron and zircon from beach sands.   The BP assets involved had sales of $885.72 million and anoperating profit of $329.4 million for the nine months ended Sept.30.</TEXT></DOC>
