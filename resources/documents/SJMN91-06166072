Conservatives seem to be attemptingto turn back the clock, while their liberal counterparts are determined to putus all in neat categories so we each can be treated according to ourgovernment-imposed classification.;    The message of civil rights should bethat the color of a person's skin has all the same significance of any otherarbitrary physical feature, which is to say it has none. No one cares whatcolor a person's eyes are. Why should the color of skin be any different? Whydoes it matter that a person was raised with different cultural values or hasa different religion?  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Editorial  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  NO GOOD CAN COME FROM US-THEM MENTALITY  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Letters to the Editor  </MEMO><TEXT>     An individual's worth to our society is not by how we classify him or herby category. Perhaps the only true measure of a person's worth is how he orshe treats his fellow human beings. Nothing good can come from anus-against-them mentality.;    When Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. set out tochange this country, it was not to create a separate-but-equal society.Rather, his dream was for a color-blind society (and by natural extension agender-blind society). Equality in the eyes of the law regardless of race,religion, sex, age or ethnic origin means exactly that. Nothing more andnothing less should be expected by anyone.;    We all need to get back on thatpath before it is too late.;    -- Steven F.
