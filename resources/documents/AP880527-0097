Vietnam said Thursday it would withdraw its 50,000 troops, orwhat it said was half its force in Cambodia, between June andDecember as part of its plan of a complete pullout by 1990. Theremaining troops are to be placed under the command of thepro-Vietnamese government, it said.   A statement issued by the Cambodian Foreign Ministry said todaythat attempts to help the Khmer Rouge return to power created a``very dangerous obstacle'' to holding peace talks with the threeCambodian guerrilla groups that oppose Vietnam's occupation. TheChinese-backed Khmer Rouge is the largest and most powerful ofthese groups.   ``It is imperative to absolutely eliminate this obstacle at atime when more than half the Vietnamese volunteer troops havealready been withdrawn from Cambodia,'' said the statement, whichwas carried by the official Cambodian radio, monitored in Bangkok.   It said the Khmer Rouge must be tried by the World Court andalso denied the use of sanctuaries in foreign territory.   Vietnam invaded Cambodia in late 1978 after a series of bloodyborder clashes with the communist Khmer Rouge government, whichkilled millions of people during its nearly four-year rule. Vietnaminstalled a pro-Hanoi government.   The radio of the Khmer Rouge dismissed Cambodia's statement aspropaganda and said it has never seen a single Vietnamese soldierleave Cambodia. It urged the world to continue pressuring Hanoi towithdraw all its forces unconditionally as demanded in annualUnited Nations resolutions.   The Cambodian government statement also said Vietnam's decisionto pull its troops in Cambodia 18 miles back from the Thai bordershowed neighborly intentions that Thailand should match. Vietnameseand Thai forces frequently have clashed along the border.   Thailand said Vietnam's decision to pull out of Cambodiaresulted from Thai Prime Minister Prem Tinsulanonda's talks lastweek with leaders in Moscow.   Thailand and its allies in the Association of Southeast AsianNations are trying to arrange informal talks in Indonesia among thewarring Cambodian factions, Vietnam and other concerned countries.   Vietnam's official Radio Hanoi said Thursday the guerrillas andtheir backers should agree to a political settlement because ``theCambodian issue will no longer exist after 1990,'' when the lasttroops leave. The pro-Vietnamese government increasingly is able tocontrol the country by itself, said a text of the broadcastobtained today.   It said the key issue is to guarantee that the Khmer Rougedoesn't return and that this is the responsibility of China, theUnited States, and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations.   Vietnam's withdrawal would be by far the largest of annualpullouts Vietnam claims to have made since 1982. The previouswithdrawals had already reduced by half the force that wasoriginally in Cambodia, Hanoi says.</TEXT></DOC>
