Above-normal traces of radioactivity were detected Monday on thefloor of an analytical laboratory handling plutonium at theSellafield nuclear plant and in a small area of the corridoroutside, said a spokesman for British Nuclear Fuels Ltd. whorequested anonymity.   No workers at the plant, about 260 miles northwest of London inCumbria, have been exposed to dangerous levels of radioactivity norhas there been a release into the environment, the spokesman said.   The Sellafield complex is the world's largest nuclearreprocessing center, extracting uranium and plutonium from spentnuclear fuel used by reactors in Britain and other countries.   The Irish government and environmental groups have repeatedlycriticized the plant's discharge of radioactive waste into theIrish Sea as a health hazard and have demanded the plant's closure.   The company says its discharges and leaks have been within safelimits.</TEXT></DOC>
