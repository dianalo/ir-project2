Doskocil Cos., a Hutchinson, Kan.-based meat and cheese processor, has acquired a 9.2% stake in Wilson and has sought federal clearance to buy the pork producer. Doskocil said last month that it is evaluating the possibility of making an offer for Wilson.    Wilson couldn't be reached for comment on its new anti-takeover provision. The plan calls for new shareholder rights to be issued on April 29 to holders of record on that date. The rights, which would allow holders to buy additional Wilson shares, are exercisable 10 days after a hostile bidder acquires 20% of the company or starts a tender offer that would give it 25% of the company. If the company is acquired, the rights allow holders to buy additional shares in the new company at half-price.    In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Wilson shares closed at $13, up 37.5 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
