Baker III,clarifying an earlier statement, said today the possibility of anIsraeli-PLO dialogue should not be ``categorically'' ruled outbecause it might some day make a contribution to peace.   Elaborating on remarks he made Tuesday, Baker indicated intestimony to the Senate Appropriations subcommittee on foreignoperations that he felt the prospects for such a dialogue wereremote.   Under questioning from Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., Baker said heonly meant to say in his earlier remarks that such a dialogue shouldnot be ``categorically, absolutely, totally and completely'' ruledout because it might help the peace process.   In testimony Tuesday before a House subcommittee, Baker said itmay some day be necessary for Israel to talk to the PLO to settlethe Palestinian problem, leaving the impression among some that U.S.policy on that issue might be shifting.   He told the House panel the overall U.S. aim is direct andmeaningful negotiations.   ``Now,'' he said, ``if you can't have direct negotiations thatare meaningful that do not involve negotiations with the PLO, Isuppose we would then have to see negotiations between Israelis andrepresentatives of the PLO.''   Baker, testifying today before the Senate Appropriationssubcommittee on foreign operations, clarified his earlier remarks bysuggesting that an Israeli-PLO dialogue was little more than ahypothetical possibility.   The subject is touchy. Israel refuses to deal with the PLO,holding it responsible for bloody terrorist attacks on civilians,diplomats and soldiers.   In Israel, Maj. Gen. Yitzhak Mordechai, head of Israel's southerncommand, said PLO chairman Yasser Arafat was aware of a ring of Arabguerrillas that crossed the Egyptian border today and attacked anIsraeli military outpost in the occupied Gaza Strip with rifles andhand grenades. Two teen-age fighters were wounded and captured.   Foreign Minister Moshe Arens, who is holding talks here, accusedthe PLO on Tuesday of committing the ``worst atrocities we've everseen since World War II.'' He said the dialogue the United Statesopened last December with Yasser Arafat's organization hadstrengthened the PLO's hand.   But Baker testified: ``It may be that you can have meaningfulnegotiations that do not involve the PLO, it may be that you can't.Our policy is simply that we think there needs to be directnegotiations which are meaningful between Israelis andPalestinians.''   Baker's statement appeared to mark another turn in an evolvingU.S. policy toward the PLO. After several unsuccessful efforts tomeet with Palestinians not identified with Arafat's group, theReagan administration last December dropped a 13-year ban on talkingto the PLO.   It acted after Arafat made public statements urged on him by theState Department renouncing terrorism and accepting Israel's rightto exist.   The Bush administration, which took office Jan. 20, continued thedialogue despite several raids by PLO guerrillas against Israelis insouthern Lebanon and last week approved visas for PLO officials toparticipate in a Mideast conference in New York.   This week, Baker has put increasing emphasis on a need forIsraeli talks with Palestinians, and in his testimony said thesessions might have to be held with the PLO in order to bemeaningful.   Arens, at a news conference in a downtown hotel, declined tocomment on Baker's statement, saying he had not heard it directly.But he again ruled out any Israeli government talks with the PLO,which he accused of murdering Israelis and Palestinians andthreatening the regime of King Hussein of Jordan.   Arens said the dialogue begun by the United States in Decembergave the PLO ``a sense of legitimacy'' and ``strengthens anorganization that is actively engaged in terrorism.''   Arens said he did not urge a suspension of the talks in hismeetings on Monday with President Bush and Baker. And, he said, Bushand Baker did not ask Israel to deal with the PLO.   But the visiting Israeli official criticized the U.S. opening tothe PLO. ``That dialogue gives them a sense of legitimacy,'' hesaid. Arens said terrorist acts by the PLO had increased since theU.S. talks opened.   ``Giving them an image of being strengthened by recognition iscounterproductive,'' the Israeli foreign minister said.   Arens said the United States and Israel should focus theirpeacemaking drive on Hussein and provide him with ``incentives'' tonegotiate over the future of the West Bank and Gaza, thepredominantly Arab territories Israel has held since the 1967Six-Day war.   He called Jordan and Palestinian residents ``the legitimateinterlocutors'' with Israel and pledged that ``we in Israel willmake every effort to move the peace process forward. We do not needany urging.''</TEXT></DOC>
