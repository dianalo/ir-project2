On other markets, energy futures fell dramatically; grains andsoybeans were higher; precious metals were lower; and stock-indexfutures advanced.   The weakness in pork was rooted in the cash hog markets, wherelarger-than-expected supplies of market-ready hogs pushed pricesdown $1.50 to $2 per hundredweight, said Tom O'Hare, livestockmarket analyst with Smith Barney, Harris Upham andamp; Co. in New York.   ``It was just a matter of too many available for what demand wascoming,'' he said.   Kills also were higher than expected with an estimated 321,000hogs slaughtered Tuesday compared with 307,000 on the same date ayear ago.   An unusually large spring pig crop will ensure against supplyproblems this fall, and the amount of pork bellies and other porkproducts in cold storage remains at near-record levels.   The bearish sentiment spread to the adjacent cattle pits, whereselling led to a modest deflation of cattle futures prices, O'Haresaid.   Live cattle settled .30 cent to 1.03 cents lower with thecontract for delivery in October at 70.97 cents a pound; feedercattle were .10 cent to .62 cent lower with September at 81.07cents a pound; hogs were 1.27 cents lower to .60 cent higher withOctober at 37.55 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were 1.77 centsto 2 cents lower with February at 1.98 cents a bushel.   Crude-oil futures plunged to their lowest levels since October1986 on signs of continuing discord within the Organization ofPetroleum Exporting Countries, analysts said.   ``There had been hope that the Iran-Iraq peace process wouldhave ushered in a new period of OPEC cooperation. Instead itappears that OPEC has dissolved and it looks like we're on thebrink of a price war,'' said Peter Beutel, an analyst with EldersFutures Inc. in New York.   Reports that one OPEC member, the United Arab Emirates, wasopenly flaunting OPEC crude-oil production quotas ``makes acomplete mockery'' of the cartel's price-support efforts, Beutelsaid.   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 36 cents to 55 centslower with October at $14.24 a barrel; heating oil was 1.17 centsto 1.39 cents lower with October at 41.71 cents a gallon; unleadedgasoline was 1.05 cents to 1.45 cents lower with October at 42.53cents a gallon.   Wheat futures prices on the Chicago Board of Trade settled attheir highest levels since July 5 _ when the year's highs were set_ on a variety of signs construed as bullish for export sales.Other grains and soybeans also gained.   A Canadian government estimate that Canada would harvest 15.4million metric tons of wheat, the smallest crop in 13 years, helpedspur the wheat market, which had been rallying quietly for abouttwo weeks, analysts said.   The report Friday from Statistics Canada prompted concerns thatCanada may be forced to reduce its wheat exports.   New bids from Jordan and Iraq for U.S. wheat and expectations ofnew demand from other countries _ including the Soviet Union _ alsosupported wheat futures, said Katharina Zimmer, a grain analystwith Merrill Lynch Capital Markets in New York.   The USDA announced aftr the close that private exporters hadsold 550,000 metric tons of U.S. corn to the Soviet Union for the1988-89 marketing year and that another 252,400 metric tons of cornhad been switched to the Soviet Union from other destinations.   Wheat settled 6 cents to 10 cents higher with the contract fordelivery in September at $4.09{ a bushel; corn was 1} cents to 5cents higher with September at $2.93{ a bushel; oats were 8 centsto 11{ cents higher with September at $2.71 a bushel; soybeans were8{ cents to 17\ cents higher with September at $8.88 a bushel.   The inflation-sensitive precious metals futures declinedmodestly on New York's Commodity Exchange, reflecting the opposingtugs of lower oil prices, which was bearish, and higher grainprices and a weaker dollar, which were bullish, analysts said.   Gold settled $2.60 to $2.70 lower with October at $429.20 a troyounce; silver was 3.3 cents to 3.8 cents lower with September at$6.485 a troy ounce.   Stock-index futures advanced slightly on the Chicago MercantileExchange, where the contract for September delivery of the Standardandamp; Poor's 500 index settled .80 point higher at 266.40.</TEXT></DOC>
