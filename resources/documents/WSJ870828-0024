Hodges president and chief executive officer, succeeding Paul L. Howard, who resigned &quot;for personal reasons.&quot;    Petrominerals said the 53-year-old Mr. Hodges, a Petrominerals director and president of closely-held Energy Production andamp; Sales Co., Tustin, Calif., will become Petrominerals president effective Sept. 15.    According to a former company official who asked not to be identified, Mr. Howard resigned as Petromineral's chairman several months ago and temporarily was succeeded by Larry S. Dodson, an outside director of the company. A Petrominerals spokeswoman declined to comment. Neither Mr. Hodges, Mr. Howard nor Mr. Dodson returned telephone calls.    Petrominerals wouldn't elaborate on the reasons for the resignation of Mr. Howard, 61, who it said would remain as a director. The management change and others it announced yesterday come less than three weeks after McFarland Energy Inc., a Santa Fe Springs, Calif.-based oil and gas producer, terminated a proposed merger with Petrominerals.    Petrominerals also said that Timothy R. McPherson resigned as vice president, secretary and chief financial officer for personal reasons. Mr. McPherson declined to comment. The company said Robert J. Merritt, Petromineral's treasurer, was named to succeed Mr. McPherson as chief financial officer. </TEXT></DOC>
