A spokesman for the Austrian president and former United Nationssecretary-general denied the allegation.   The May 18, 1938, letter describes Waldheim as having been ``aconvinced Nazi for years,'' the congress said in a statement. Theletter to the Austrian Chamber of Commerce was written onWaldheim's behalf by the head of Vienna's Consular Academy, adiplomatic college where he was studying.   The academy director also wrote that Waldheim had submittedproof that he had four Aryan grandparents. Waldheim got thescholarship of 130 Reichsmarks to continue his studies for theyear, the World Jewish Congress said.   An American graduate student in Vienna, Richard Mitten, foundthe document in archives at the Consular Academy and provided it tothe World Jewish Congress, which gave it to the Justice Department.   ``It shows the big lie as to Waldheim's claim that he was not aNazi supporter'' while a student in Vienna, Neal Sher, chief warcrimes prosecutor at the Justice Department, told The New YorkTimes.   Austrian embassy spokesman Ulf Pacher said schoolmatescontradicted the letter, saying Waldheim was stridently anti-Naziwhile at the academy. Other than the letter ``there is no evidenceto support the theory that Waldheim was a Nazi'' at the academy,Pacher said told the Times.   The embassy provided two affidavits from schoolmates, the Timesreported. George Weidenfeld, who published Waldheim's memoirs inBritain, said Waldheim ``voiced definitely anti-racist views andhad many Jewish friends at the academy.'' Susanne Lederer, a Dutchwoman who attended the academy, also said Waldheim clearly opposedthe Nazis though he ``kept silent in public.''   Waldheim has been trying to persuade the Justice Department toremove his name from a list of people who are banned from enteringthe United States because of their activities in World War II.   In 1986, the Justice Department found evidence that Waldheim hadpersecuted Jews, Greeks and Yugoslavs after he joined the Germanarmy.   ``Waldheim, who has been shown to lie about his years during thewar and after the war, has now been shown to lie about his yearsbefore the war,'' Elan Steinberg, executive director of the WorldJewish Congress, said Saturday night.</TEXT></DOC>
