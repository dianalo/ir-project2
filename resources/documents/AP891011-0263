Stories abound of care-givers and sitters who ignore,abandon, abuse or kidnap children.   In a case that gained nationwide attention last March, aChattanooga, Tenn., sitter was sentenced to a year in jail afterthe parents of a 6-year-old boy secretly videotaped her viciouslyslapping their child. In August, a day-care provider near Hartford,Conn., was arrested after a 3-year-old child died in the woman'slocked car, evidently from heat stroke.   A recent article in Child magazine offered tips on how to avoid``babysitters from hell.''   Many working parents rely on referrals from friends andrelatives to hire help, but the result often is an unlicensed,untrained care-giver who can range from a total stranger to thegrandmotherly widow down the block.   For the Jackles and other clients of Mrs. Hurst, who found herby word-of-mouth, the main attractions included her state licenseto practice in-home day care, her acceptance of payment by check,her willingness to keep children until 7 p.m. and her $85 weeklybill, which includes food. But perhaps the biggest draw of all wasMrs. Hurst's reliability.   ``We have friends who have gone through sitters every otherweek,'' said Mrs. Jackle, who had taken time off to raise her sonfor the first few years. ``For a while I wasn't sure I was goingback to work or not.''   The day-care dilemma has been compounded by the practice of manycare-givers to take cash only, so they don't have to report theincome on their tax returns. An estimated $7 billion in day-careincome goes unreported annually.   This year for the first time, parents must provide the name andsocial security number of their day-care provider to the InternalRevenue Service to qualify for a tax credit to defray part of thecost. The IRS plans to use the information to cross-reference thereturns of providers and prosecute cheaters.   Day-care experts believe the law could make it even harder forparents to afford day care, since many providers will raise theirrates to compensate for having to pay tax.   ``It's a situation where the government hasn't helped parents onchild care very much at all,'' said Judsen Culbreth, editor ofWorking Mother magazine. ``Now they're making it even harder.''   Barbara Reisman, executive director of the Child Care ActionCampaign, also criticized the tax crackdown.   ``Child-care workers are the lowest paid workers in thiscountry. One of the ways people are able to survive are to be paidwithout having to declare the income,'' she said.   ``I don't recommend people cheat on their taxes,'' she said.``But many parents can't afford to pay the full cost of care. Thisdoesn't address the real problem.''</TEXT><NOTE>End adv Sunday Oct. 15</NOTE></DOC>
