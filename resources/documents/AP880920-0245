On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the October contract forWest Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S. crude, settled16 cents higher at $14.73 a barrel Monday after a late-afternoonrally in anticipation of the contract's expiration on Tuesday.   Wholesale unleaded gasoline for October delivery gained 0.02cent to close at 44.24 cents a gallon.   The October wholesale heating oil contract lost 0.01 cent tosettle at 41.36 cents a gallon.   Analysts said the market opened lower, influenced by a reportthat Saudi Arabia intentionally was violating its production quotain a direct challenge to the 12 other nations of the Organizationof Petroleum Exporting Countries.   The Petroleum Intelligence Weekly, a respected industrynewsletter, said the quota violation was a Saudi strategy ahead ofnext week's meeting of the cartel's price monitoring committee tobring other quota violators back in line with OPEC pricing policyby competing with them for market share.   The meeting is scheduled for Sept. 25 and 26, either in Viennaor on the Indonesian island of Bali, according to reports.   Saudi Arabia is OPEC's largest oil producer and once wasconsidered the swing producer, and in a position to influence otherOPEC members. But recently, some analysts have questioned SaudiArabia's leadership role.   Iraq, for example, has refused to abide by an OPEC-imposedquota, saying it needs the oil revenue to rebuild its war-torncountry. Other member nations also have admitted violating outputlimits.   Analysts said the market interpreted the Saudi reportnegatively. They said last week's optimism that an OPEC pricemeeting could lead to production limits and higher oil prices hasnow turned mixed.   Analysts also said Monday that gasoline futures weresurprisingly weak after last week's rally brought on by the threatof a hurricane disrupting production in the Gulf of Mexico.   ``I guess it was an overbought market,'' said Richard Kane, anoil broker with Merrill Lynch Energy Futures.</TEXT></DOC>
