According to the official China Daily newspaper, Minister WangFang warned that ``sabotage instigated from abroad has beenintensified recently.''   Wang did not elaborate, and it was not clear whether he wasreferring to sabotage against the Chinese government or to lastmonth's short-lived terrorist threat against Americans in Beijing.   He urged police to stay on their guard and recommended stifferpenalties for lawbreakers. China already imposes the death penaltyfor numerous crimes, ranging from theft to panda poaching to murder.   Wang made his comments to more than 200 public securitydirectors at the end of a national conference Wednesday.   A day earlier, Premier Li Peng told the gathering that publicsecurity must be tightened to control ``social upheavals'' thatwill inevitably result from China's ongoing economic reforms.   Discontent with price increases, widening income gaps betweenpoor and rich and student pressure for political freedom to matchthe new economic freedom all have contributed to growing tensionsin Chinese society.   Peasant raids on fertilizer warehouses, short-lived strikes overwages and other illegal and sometimes violent protests that wouldhave been unheard of a decade ago have become more frequent.   Three large illegal protests are known to have occured inBeijing in June.   About 1,000 Beijing University students marched to PublicSecurity headquarters on June 3 to protest the murder of a fellowstudent. A second planned march was thwarted by a police show offorce.   Several dozen students from the northeastern city of Changchuntried to hold a sit-in outside Communist Party headquarters a weeklater complaining that their study program was not accredited.   More than 1,500 peasants in a village on Beijing's outskirtsclashed with police to try to halt the release of contaminatedwater into their drinking and irrigation water supply.   Both the Changchun students and the peasants were dispersedforcibly. A series of statements by top officials during the monthmade it clear they have no intention of allowing the authority ofthe ruling Communist Party to be challenged.   White collar and violent crime also have increased, partlybecause of the new social tensions and partly because China'seconomic reforms have increased temptations to steal.   The Public Security Ministry said crimes resulting in seriousinjury or death rose 31 percent in the first four months of theyear, compared with the same period last year.   Officials have said cases of gambling, prostitution andpublishing pornography are increasing, and they have blamed China'sgreater openness to the outside world.   China last month had its first known case of a terrorist threatagainst foreigners. Officials said nationals from an undisclosedthird country plotted an attack on Americans in Beijing, but werethwarted. No details were released.</TEXT></DOC>
