The radiobiological principles of radiation effects aredescribed in detail for the purpose of deriving threshold doses and riskcoefficients. The concept of the International Commission on RadiologicalProtection is thoroughly discussed as characterized by conceptions suchas justification, optimization and limitation. How it has been adaptedto the radiation protection legislature in the Federal Republic of Germany,or included into the forthcoming amendment is subject to extensive discussion.In conclusion, it is attempted to quantify the radiation risk for thepopulation from dose limits or intervention levels of dose from the normaloperation of radiation sources or accidental exposure.
