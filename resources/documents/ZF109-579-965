a toaster won't toast until aperson actually depresses its lever, and a television won't change thechannel until someone turns the dial.andP;  It doesn't matter that the applianceisn't intelligent in the same way a computer is, we still communicate with iton some rudimentary level.andM;Traditionally, computers haven't made any more effort to understand theirhuman users than toasters have.andP;  They act on their instructions and returnresults, but it is the computer that dictates the interaction.andP;  It's anunhealthy relationship, with one partner putting in all the effort tocommunicate with the other.andP;  If the computer operates through a command-lineinterface, then the user has to learn all the appropriate commands.andP;  Even&quot;user-friendly&quot; graphical interfaces enforce a certain method ofcommunication, one that is not necessarily intuitive to all users.andM;The interface problem is now the focus of attention in the computer industry.andO;Having spent the last thirty or so years making computers faster and smarter,developers are now looking for ways to make their power more accessible tousers.andP;  Increasing the &quot;human bandwidth,&quot; or the ease with which users canabsorb information, really means presenting the information in a way thattakes advantage of a human's processing power, rather than restricting theinformation to what the computer can provide.andM;Multimedia is the latest buzzword in an industry already cluttered withjargon, but it may be one of the few that isn't completely meaningless.andO;Humans are more than capable of synthesizing the barrage of information thatall five of their senses provide them.andP;  The most obvious way for computers topresent users with information is by taking advantage of multiple senses.andO;The text or pictorial interfaces we're used to now only provide visualinformation, and even that is on a static, rudimentary level.andM;A multimedia application could incorporate not only standard textinformation, but also voice and CD-quality sound, as well as video, either incolor or black and white, depending on a user's needs.andP;  Multimedia systemscould be authored for everything from a simple training documentincorporating graphics, sound, and video to advanced design applicationswhere elements can be physically manipulated by the user.andM;Nuts and BoltsandM;A multimedia station has several technological requirements, almost all ofwhich are related to the enormous file sizes of multimedia documents.andP;  One ofthe main problems lies in storing audio and video data.andP;  For example, asingle-color video frame contains close to 1MB of information.andP;  To be easilyabsorbed by the eye, without any discernible jerkiness, a live motion videohas to display 30 frames per second.andP;  Just one minute of color video couldquickly dispose of the storage capacity of a single file server.andM;Optical disk jukeboxes, with their capacities of fifty or sixty disks, arecapable of providing the requisite storage space for multimedia documents.andO;Unfortunately, the technology is still slow, by hard disk standards, andoptical disk jukeboxes, which have to switch disks, can have access times ofup to several seconds.andM;The limitations of optical disks notwithstanding, there are plenty ofhigh0end workstations for less than $10,000 that provide the necessarystorage, bus throughput, high-resolution graphics, audio attachments, andprocessing power to make them realistic platforms for multimedia systems.andO;The real hurdle is in exploiting networks to both author and presentmultimedia documents.andM;Networks will be the natural vehicles for interconnecting the various devicesused to author multimedia documents.andP;  Synchronizing and incorporating all theelements from different devices into one document is now relatively easy.andO;Allowing people to work on a document simultaneously from differentworkstations is not.andM;Imagine an automotive manufacturer trying to design a new car.andP;  Not only doall the members of the design team need to be able to make changes, but othergroups within the company, such as metallurgy or marketing, provide input aswell.andP;  The information has to be communicated over the network, complete witha synthetic image of the vehicle that can be changed on the fly, by any user,anywhere on the network.andP;  In a multinational company, the information mayneed to travel over global networks.andP;  The bandwidth requirements forcommunicating files that could stretch into the hundreds of megabits, andpossibly even gigabits, are staggering.andM;Communication problems could be solved with the advent of highbandwidthtechnologies like FDDI, but given the current file sizes, which are almostsure to expand as multimedia becomes more popular, even 100MB isn't going tobe enough.andP;  Barring some radical advances, multimedia networking is probablygoing to be limited to LANs for the near future.andP;  Enterprisewide, real-timecommunications will have to wait until the bandwidth problem can bereasonably solved.andM;That doesn't mean that multimedia systems are still a thing of the future,although they are viewed as such.andP;  Right now, multimedia systems seem to beregarded as esoteric research tools rather than practical business systems.andO;The NeXT machine is an example of a multimedia system suffering at the handsof its marketing.andP;  Billed as a high-end research tool, the NeXT machine hasfound its way into a lot of universities but not many businesses.andP;  However, atrickle of third-party software developers are starting to releaseapplications for the NeXT.andM;&quot;It's not a technology problem,&quot; says Alan Trimble, director of CorporateMarketing at Silicon Graphics (Mountain View, Calif.).andP;  &quot;[Multimedia' is outthere.andP;  Yes, there are an awful lot of computer people doing research on itbecause its the next generation system, but there are at least five differentfully legitimate multimedia machines out there in the $6,000 to $8,000 pricerange.andP;  It's really a marketing problem.&quot;andM;Real-Life ApplicationsandM;Although not in widespread use, multimedia is penetrating those markets thatfind them immediately useful, especially the desktop presentation market.andO;Desktop presentation, a step beyond desktop publishing, allows the authoringand viewing of documents that rely heavily on audio, video, and syntheticgraphics.andP;  Silicon Graphics, for example, provided the system NBC used duringthe 1988 Olympics broadcast from Seoul, Korea.andP;  Between segments, programmersbuilt segues on the fly that incorporated animation and prerecorded video.andM;Low-end products for dat-to-day businesses incorporate graphics and audioinformation to facilitate communications among co-workers.andP;  BBN/Slate fromBBN Software Products (Cambridge, Mass.) incorporates text processing,graphics, spreadsheets with business graphs, scanned images, live links toother programs, and speech or prerecorded audio indicated by icons into itssystem.andP;  It also comes with the Slate Extension Language, which allows usersto customize the system to their needs.andP;  BBN/Slate runs on DEC, IBM, and SUNUnix-based workstations and costs $297 for a three-user license.andM;Image (Ypsilanti, Mich.) sells a multimedia database for the NeXT machinecalled MediaStation.andP;  MediaStation allows image scanning and processing,sound recording and editing, frame-by-fram animation, and text processing,all recorded in multimedia archives, which can then be used for interactivetraining or desktop presentations.andP;  The MediaStation can act as a multimediaserver over an Ethernet network and is priced at $2,500.andM;Informix's OnLine Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) also featuresmultimedia capability.andP;  OnLine's data fields contain large blocks ofinformation called BLOBs (Binary Large OBjects), allowing images,spreadsheets, and voice to be stored and accessed just like any otherdata-type.andP;  It runs on a variety of Unix-based systems.andP;  OnLine ranges from$1,600 for a low-end PC to $164,000 for a high-end Unix system with unlimitedusers.andM;OBviously, the multimedia applications currently available run almostexclusively on Unix-based machines, and it's not hard to understand why.andO;First, the high-end machines necessary to implement multimedia systems aredeveloped by workstation manufacturers like Sun Microsystems,Hewlett-Packard, DEC, Silicon Graphics, and NeXT and are all Unix-based.andP;  Asan operating system, Unix lends itself to multitasking and can take advantageof parallel processors, making for a more dynamic, robust multimedia system.andO;DOS-based machines are not only single tasking, but lack the requisiteprocessing power.andP;  OS/2 could conceivably support a full-blown multimediaauthoring or presentation system, but no applications are available yet.andP;  Ifthe trend continues, multimedia may be the final push that Unix needs tosucceed as the high-end operating system of choice for networks.andM;What It Means for the FutureandM;The rolling ball of multimedia may not stop at the workplace.andP;  An intuitivesystem, complete with sound and graphics, can be as popular at home as it isin the office environment.andP;  Networks such as CompuServe and Prodigy havealready infiltrated thousands of homes across the country.andP;  Nintendo alreadymaintains a nationwide entertainment network in Japan and is developing onefor the United States, where one-fifth of the homes already have its systems.andM;The advent of HDTV, which is merely a digital device that incorporates audiovideo, and synthetic graphics, could bring a multimedia system into theliving room.andP;  It's also not inconceivable that later models of HDTV willinclude RISC processors, RAM, and interfaces for your stereo, VCR, PC, andtelephone, allowing for communication between homes, as well as to theoffice.andP;  Multimedia capability may have already provided the germ for thenext frontier of communications.andM;Virtual RealtyandM;The interface between human and computer need not stop at the monitor andkeyboard.andP;  The wave of the future is for users and their worstations tointeract in the same environment.andP;  Commonplace peripherals already facilitatethis kind of interaction.andP;  Mouses, sensor balls, and light pens all let theuser input information in an intuitive, easily manipulated way.andP;  Systemscurrently under research will allow users to manipulate a computer-generatedenvironment just as they would manipulate them in the real world.andM;If multimedia systems ease the communication barrier, then the new technologyof virtual reality eliminates it altogether.andP;  A computer-generatedenvironment that enfolds users in a cartoon-like world that they canphysically manipulat, virtual realty has been, until recently, the exclusiveprovince of science fiction.andP;  In books such as &quot;Count Zero,&quot; &quot;BurningChrome,&quot; and, of course, &quot;Neuromancer,&quot; William Gibson anticipated a world inwhich counterparts of today's hackers operated in a globally generated,primarily visual, artificial realty.andP;  While some of its leading proponentsseem determined to propagate that other-worldly, and undoubtedly romantic,character of the technology, virtual reality has more immediate,pre-apocalyptic, potential.andM;Currently, virtual reality projects are underway in several places, includingVPL Research, Autodesk (Sausalito, Calif.), and NASA.andP;  The applicationpoterntial for virtual reality is enormous, but really only in the longrange, since some significant technological barriers still exist.andP;  Creatingan entire visual universe requires more graphics power than is offered bytoday's processors; much of the research is centered around parallelprocessing, synchronization, and dynamic allocation of computing resources.andM;Getting the computer-generated universe to work in real time is also provingdifficult, yet the problem lies not so much in computing power, but in theavailable sensor technology, according to Christopher Allis, public relationsdirector for Autodesk's Cyberspace project.andP;  A userhs movement iscommunicated to the computer and the virtual environment through acombination of body sensors.andP;  In AZutodesk's virtual reality demonstration,for example, a headset and glove provide the user with a visualrepresentation of the artificial environment and a way to manipulate it,through an eerie, disembodied hand.andP;  The glove is equipped with optical fiberthat runs along each finger.andP;  When the user bends his or her fingers thesignal decays at the knuckles, allowing the system to register the movement.andO;There is a 200 millisecond delay between the user's movement and itsreplication in the virtual environment.andP;  So, although there is a continuousstream of virtual movement, it is a fraction of a second behind the actualevent.andP;  The frame rate is also slow enought that the motion is sometimesstatic.andP;  The lag makes what is already an intensely weird, thoughexhilarating experience, a little sickening as well.andM;In Autodesk's artificial world, fish hang suspended in the air, orangepeel-like sculptures hover over open rooms, and office furniture filesthrough the air.andP;  The practical applications are immediately apparent.andO;Architects could move through rooms they had designed, moving furniture orwhole walls, changing dimensions, colors, and lighting schemes.andP;  Real-lifebehavior could also be mimicked in virtual reality, allowing designers totest various building materials in various environmental conditions.andP;  Ofcourse, the application potential goes beyond business into entertainment,especially as the graphics become more realistic.andP;  Autodesk has also attacheda bicycle to one of their demo systems, allowing arm-chair athletes to cruisethrough a lunar-like landscape, both on and off the ground.andM;Multiple users could also share the same reality, encounter each other'svirtual replications, and manipulate the same objects.andP;  Again, theapplications could be practical, allowing two engineers to work on the samedesign problem, or just plain fun, creating a virtual tennis court forgeographically disparate users to play together.andP;  The central barrier to thisinteraction is the same as that found in networking multimedia systems --bandwidth.andM;Cost is another limiting factor.andP;  AutoDesk's demo system is a relativelycheap one, at approximately $50,000.andP;  The other systems under development runwell over $100,000 and will most likely not be practical for business useanytime soon.andP;  Where they may proliferate in the next couple of decades is inthe military sector.andP;  Virtual reality could be used to simulate a variety ofenvironments, from a bullet-torn battlefield to life on a space station.andM;Virtual reality projects are still in their nascent stages.andP;  With theunrealistic graphics, response-time lag, and prohibitibe cost, the days ofgrungy techno-teens plugging into the &quot;consensual hallucination&quot; of Gibson'scyberspace are still years away.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
