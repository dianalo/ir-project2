Experts have estimated that a 1 percent depletion could mean a 5percent to 6 percent increase in skin cancers.   But today's report from the National Aeronautics and SpaceAdministration, the work of more than 100 experts over 17 months,put the annual ozone depletion over the mid-latitudes of thenorthern hemisphere at a much higher rate.   Those latitudes, 30 degrees to 64 degrees, take in all of theUnited States except southern Texas, Louisiana and Florida andextend halfway up Canada's Yukon Territory.   The scientists laid the responsibility for the ozone depletionsquarely on chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), chemicals used to powersome aerosol sprays.   ``At this point there is no other culprit to blame,'' saidSherwood Rowland of the University of California at Irvine. ``Wehave taken out all the natural phenomena that are believed toaffect ozone.''   The report also said that the annual springtime depletion ofozone over Antarctica appears to be diluting ozone yearround overthe Southern Hemisphere to about 60 degrees southern latitude, apoint midway between the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula and CapeHorn at the southern tip of South America.   Rowland, who headed one NASA study groups, said the scientistshad re-examined years of ground-based and satellite observations ofthe atmosphere to remove the normal biennial fluctuations of manyatmospheric characteristics and also the effects of the 11-yearsolar cycle.   The ground-based observations were limited to mid-latitudes inthe Northern Hemisphere because there are few stations elsewhere inthe world. But never before have scientists re-analyzed the monthlydata at differing latitudes to try to remove the solar and biennialfluctuations.   Ozone in the atmosphere 15 miles to 25 miles up filters out thesun's ultraviolet rays, making life on earth possible. The sameultraviolet breaks up the CFC compounds, liberating chlorine, whichin turn destroys ozone.   Ozone is a pollutant on the ground, but CFCs don't break upthere _ not enough ultraviolet gets through.   CFCs were banned as aerosol propellants in the United States in1978, and worldwide emissions declined. There was one report in1983 from the National Academy of Sciences that said future ozonedecline would be only 2 percent to 4 percent.   But CFC use started growing again, in part because one compoundturned out to be ideal for cleaning computer chips and otherelectronic parts. Other major uses are for refrigeration fluids andas blowing agents in making plastic foams.   Then an annual ozone ``hole'' over the Antarctic was discovered,and records going back to 1958 showed that it hadn't happenedbefore the late 1970s.   Discovery of the ozone hole _ an annual Antarctic springtimeplunge in ozone concentrations, last year by a record 50 percent _spurred treaty negotiators last fall in Montreal.   The Environmental Protection Agency has estimated that a 1percent thinning of the Earth's ozone shield means a 5 percent to 6percent increase in skin cancer. If CFC use continued increasing at2.5 percent per year, EPA said, 20 percent of the ozone barriercould be gone in the next century.   Today's report came one day after the Senate, on a vote of 83-0,became the first major chemical-producing nation to ratify a31-country treaty cutting emissions that damage the Earth'sprotective ozone layer.   The treaty commits the signers to a 50 percent cut from 1986levels in production of compounds called chlorofluorocarbons, CFCs,by 1998.   The treaty will be officially ratified when the president signsit. Though the United States will be the first major producer ofCFC compounds to ratify, it is not the first ratifier _ that isMexico.   Under the treaty, EPA says, the decline would slow to the pointwhere it would be swamped by the normal year-to-year fluctuations.   The Soviet Union has several CFC plants under construction, andwon concessions permitting it to exceed the treaty limits for atime _ which led to a Soviet treaty signature in December. Similarprovisions were made for developing countries. If those exceptionsare used, the Environmental Defense Fund has estimated, the actual1998 rollback in emissions could be 35 percent instead of 50percent.</TEXT></DOC>
