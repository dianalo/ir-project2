The Department has now completedthe administrative review in accordance with section 751 of the TariffAct of 1930 (``the Act'').<ITAG tagnum="84">Scope of the Review</ITAG>Imports covered by the review are shipments of color television receivers,except for video monitors, complete or incomplete, from Taiwan. The ordercovers all color television receivers regardless of tariff classification.The merchandise is currently classifiable under item numbers 684.9246,684.9248, 684.9520, 684.9522, 684.9253, 684.9255, 684.9256, 684.9258, 684.9562,684.9263, 684.9270, 684.9275, 684.9655, 684.9656, 684.9658, 684.9660, and684.9663 of the <T3>Tariff Schedules of the United States Annotated </T3>and item number8528.10.80 of the <T3>Harmonized System.</T3> The review covers eleven manufacturers and/orexporters of Taiwanese color television receivers, except for video monitors,to the United States, and the period April 1, 1985 through March 31, 1986.<ITAG tagnum="84">Analysis of Comments Received</ITAG>We gave interested parties an opportunity to comment on the preliminaryresults and tentative determination to revoke in part as provided by andSection;353.53a(c) of the Commerce Regulations. We received comments from the petitioners(International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, International Union ofElectronic, Electrical, Technical, Salaried and Machine Workers, AFL-CIO-CLC,Independent Radionic Workers of America, Industrial Union Department, AFL-CIO),Zenith Electronics Corporation, and the respondents, Hitachi, Sampo, Shin-Shirasuna,and Tatung.We received additional comments from the respondents, the petitioners,and Zenith concerning mathematical or clerical errors. We have correctedsuch errors, but have not addressed them specifically in this notice.<T3>Comment 1:</T3> Zenith states that constructed value calculations shouldnot be adjusted for circumstance-of-sale expenses. The Department shoulddelete all downward adjustments from its calculations.Particularly with regard of Tatung, Zenith notes that the general, selling,and administrative expenses used in computing constructed value were exceededby claimed direct selling expenses used to adjust the constructed valuecalculations.<T3>Department's Position:</T3> We disagree. Section 773(a)(4)(B) of theAct provides that where it is established that the amount of any differencebetween United States price and foreign market value is due to differencesin circumstances of sale, ``due allowance shall be made.'' Section 773(a)of the Act does not distinguish constructed value from any other methodof determining foreign market value. Thus, circumstance-of-sale adjustmentsare required where constructed value is used as the basis for foreign marketvalue, just as they are required where home market or third-country pricesare used. <T3>See Timken Co. v. United States</T3> 673 F. Supp. 495 (1987); <T3>See also</T3> the final results of the first administrative reviewon <T3>Color Television Receivers, Except for Video Monitors, from Taiwan,</T3>(51 FR 56895, December 29, 1986) and <T3>Tapered Roller Bearings from Japan,</T3> (52 FR 30700, August 17, 1987).We have corrected an inadvertent error, however, and have reduced the amountsfor circumstance-of-sale adjustments made to Tatung's constructed value.<T3>Comment 2:</T3> Zenith contends that the Department has failed to takeinto account the average age and balance of accounts payable relating toa respondent's home market sales activity, as opposed to product processactivity. With respect to discounts, rebates, and differences in circumstancesof sale in the home market, Zenith maintains that the true cost to therespondent is not the amount paid out, but rather that amount minus thesavings realized by paying that amount sometime after the obligation topay was incurred.<T3>Department's Position:</T3> When an expense is inherent in a transaction(<T3>e.g.</T3> credit costs when payment is delayed), yet no sales-specificquantification of such costs exists, we impute expenses/costs. The Departmentavoids imputing expenses/costs where a company quantifies the actual expenses/costsand provides adequate documentation of those expenses. Our examinationof the rebate and/or discount system used by the Taiwanese manufacturersindicates that the amount of the rebate/discount paid to the customer accuratelyrepresents the expense to the seller. <T3>See Television Receivers, Monochrome and Color, From Japan, Final Resultsof Antidumping Duty Administrative Review,</T3> (53 FR 4050, February 11,1988).<T3>Comment 3:</T3> Zenith contends that the Department should ascertainwhether AOC's and Tatung's home market advertising adjustment claims areallocated over the total value of all types of sales which benefit fromadvertising and not just over the sales to the purchaser categories servingas the basis for the foreign market value calculation.<T3>Department's Position:</T3> Tatung and AOC allocated home market advertisingover the total value of all sales in the home market.<T3>Comment 4: </T3>Zenith and the petitioners maintain that AOC, Fulet,Sampo, and Tatung should not have included certain non-selling generaland administrative expenses in their calculation of the ESP offset. Inaddition, Zenith asserts that Fulet, Tatung, and Sampo should not be allowedto claim a financing expense on their home market inventories during thepre-sale period. The petitioners state that Fulet's general and administrativeexpenses are not selling expenses, but instead are fixed overhead expensesthat are not related to Fulet's sales of color televisions under review.Fulet should explain how its home market indirect selling expenses relateto sales of color televisions in the home market.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>From the documents submitted by respondents,the Department is satisfied that all the expenses included in the ESP offsetare indirect selling expenses. Certain of the general expenses are associatedwith selling and respondents, therefore, included these expenses in thecalculation of indirect expenses. We have accepted respondents' calculationof an indirect interest expense for the inventory carrying period fromthe time the merchandise leaves the central warehouse until the merchandiseis sold in the home market. This period is equivalent to the time we useto calculate an inventory carrying cost for all ESP sales, <T3>i.e.,</T3> from the time the goods leave the central warehouse untilthey are shipped to the ultimate purchaser in the U.S. We agree with thepetitioners that the inventory carrying cost should be calculated basedon the cost of the inventory and not the inventory's invoice price. Thisis consistent with our methodology on the U.S. side. <T3>See</T3> the <T3>Study of Antidumping Adjustments Methodology and Recommendations forStatutory Change</T3> (November, 1985), p.10. We have corrected this calculationin our final determination.<T3>Comment 5:</T3> Zenith states that failure to require respondents tosubmit full costs of manufacture for model matches should be correctedand the final calculations should include differences in merchandise determinedby comparison of such fully developed costs.<T3>Department's Position:</T3> We disagree. All respondents, where appropriate,submitted sufficient cost information to adjust for differences in thephysical characteristics of the merchandise. Differences in manufacturingcosts which are not due to physical differences in the merchandise itselfdo not qualify as adjustments. Comparing total manufacturing costs, asZenith suggests, would result in characterizing all cost differences asresulting from physical differences in the merchandise, regardless of whatactually generates the differences.<T3>Comment 6:</T3> The petitioners and Zenith contend that the Departmentmust account for taxes forgiven on exports by adding to U.S. price theamount actually forgiven and by capping that amount at the level of suchtaxes collected on home market sales and passed through to home marketpurchasers. It is not correct for the Department to conclude that a fullpass through occurred and deduct such amount from the home market price.Zenith cites for support the ruling of the Court of International Trade(``CIT'') in <T3>Zenith </T3>v.<T3> United States</T3> (April 24, 1986). AOC, Fulet, Sampo, and Tatungassert that indirect taxes exempted on exports should be added to the U.S.price, rather than deducted from the home market price. The Department'sapproach of deducting the amount of the exempted tax from home-market pricemisuses the statutory provisions for ``best information available.'' However,the Department correctly determined that Taiwan's indirect taxes have beenpassed through to the home market customer.<T3>Department's Position:</T3> The CIT issued its final decision in <T3>Zenith </T3>on January 14, 1988. Because the Department has appealedthat decision, we are continuing to assume that all indirect taxes in thehome market are included in the price paid by the ultimate customers. Wedid not attempt to measure the amount of tax ``passed through'' to customersin the Taiwanese market for several reasons.First, we do not agree that the statutory language limiting the amountof the adjustment to the amount of the commodity tax ``added to or includedin the price'' of televisions sold in Taiwan requires the Department tomeasure the incidence of the tax in an economic sense. Second, applyingsuch an interpretation would be contrary to the obligations of the UnitedStates under the GATT Dumping Code. Third, measuring the incidence of thecommodity tax in Taiwan would be an enormous and extremely complex task.The Department simply lacks the resources, in terms of both manpower andexpertise, to shoulder such a burden. We do, however, agree that the amountof commodity tax forgiven by reason of the export of televisions to theUnited States must be added to United States price (USP) under the statute.We have made this change in the final determination.For this review we did not have the tax base or tax that would have beenpaid on the exported televisions. As the best evidence of the tax forgivenby reason of export, we have assumed that the amount of commodity tax wouldbe identical for the U.S. models and the home market comparison models.<T3>Comment 7:</T3> Zenith argues that the Department should have includedsamples and damaged set sales in its preliminary determination. Accordingly,all Hitachi sales must be included in the final analysis, along with allmovement and carrying costs associated with merchandise damaged beyondrepair. Fulet's accommodation sales should be compared with ordinary homemarket sales, not home market accommodation sales.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>We agree in part. Sample sales should beincluded in the analysis. The Department requested that any sales of samplessold within the meaning of section 772 of the Act be included in respondents'submissions and we have no reason to believe that any such sales were notincluded. Because we could not distinguish between insurance claims, damagedset sales, and billing mistakes in Hitachi's irregular sales information,we have chosen to include all such sales in the final determination.We believe that comparing Fulet's accommodation sales in both markets resultsin the closest possible concordance between levels of trade as requiredby 19 CFR 353.19. We made these comparisons because the accommodation salescategory in both markets involves sales to customers other than unrelateddealers. <T3>See</T3> the final results of the first administrative review in thiscase, cited <T3>supra.</T3><T3>Comment 8:</T3> Zenith is unsure whether the Department, with regardto Hitachi and RCA, included selling expenses incurred in the home marketwith respect to sales to the United States.<T3>Department's Position:</T3> Hitachi and RCA only maintain productionfacilities in Taiwan. There are no selling expenses incurred by Hitachiand RCA at their production facilities.<T3>Comment 9:</T3> Zenith states that the Department erroneously treatedselling commissions in the United States as though they consist entirelyof indirect expenses. Commissions in the U.S. should be broken down intotheir direct and indirect expense components and the offset to FMV shouldbe capped at the level of the indirect expense element.<T3>Department's Position:</T3> We disagree. Respondents have demonstratedthat commissions paid to unrelated parties bear a direct relationship tothe sales under consideration. It is not necessary to examine how the commissionairespent the money; to the seller it is a direct expense, incurred only becausea particular sale was made. We have treated these expenses as direct circumstance-of-saleadjustments according to andSection; 353.15 of the regulations and, whereappropriate, have deducted indirect selling expenses in the market wherethere is no commission up to the amount of the commission in the othermarket.<T3>Comment 10:</T3> Zenith maintains that the Department should correctits exporter's sales price calculations by deducting the amount of antidumping-relatedlegal expenses which respondents paid during the period under review.<T3>Department's Position:</T3> We disagree. As a matter of administrativepractice, the ITA does not consider legal fees incurred in connection withthe antidumping duty investigations to be related directly or indirectlyto sales. This practice is stated in our <T3>Study of Antidumping Adjustments Methodology and Recommendations forStatutory Change</T3> (November, 1985), p. 40. The antidumping law wasintended to offset actual margins of dumping. Legal fees are incurred indefense against an allegation of dumping and are not expenses directlyrelated to sales. The inclusion of legal fees as a circumstance-of-saleadjustment could alone produce a margin. <T3>See</T3> the final results of the first administrative review in thiscase, cited <T3>supra.</T3><T3>Comment 11:</T3> Zenith contends that the Department should reduceUSP by the amount of estimated antidumping duties paid along with the amountof estimated ordinary duties paid.<T3>Department's Position:</T3> We disagree. Unlike ordinary duties, antidumpingduties paid upon entry of the merchandise are only estimates. We do notknow the actual amounts per sale until we complete an administrative reviewof the period. To subtract these estimates from USP would cause highermargins, thereby skewing the accuracy of the Department's results. TheDepartment would then need to determine the difference between the actualand estimated duty amounts and adjust its calculations accordingly. Becauseof the imprecise nature of such an exercise, the Department's practiceis to make no adjustment for these duty deposits.<T3>Comment 12:</T3> Zenith questions the lack of a royalty expense onU.S. sales by some of the respondents.<T3>Department's Position:</T3> The Department requested information onany royalty paid by respondents in its questionnaire. We have no reasonto believe the information submitted was inaccurate or otherwise insufficient.<T3>Comment 13:</T3> Zenith maintains that the Department's present methodof establishing the deposit rate as a percentage of reviewed entries' statutoryUSP, rather than as a percentage of their lower entered value, understatesthe best estimate of ultimate liability on future entries.<T3>Department's Position:</T3> At the time of entry of any shipment, U.S.price has yet to be determined. Since cash deposits of estimated antidumpingduties are required at that time, we instruct Customs to require such cashdeposits expressed as a percentage of the only information available, whichis entered value. <T3>See Television Receivers, Monochrome and Color, from Japan,</T3> (52FR 8940, March 27, 1987).<T3>Comment 14:</T3> The petitioners and Zenith object to the arbitrarydetermination of 0.5 percent as <T3>de minimis.</T3> In <T3>Carlisle Tire andamp; Rubber Co. </T3>v. <T3>United States,</T3> the court acknowledged that, in the absence ofa valid rule, the Department must explain the basis for <T3>de minimis.</T3><T3>Department's Position:</T3> In <T3>Carlisle Tire and Rubber Co.</T3> v. <T3>United States,</T3> 634 F. Supp. 419 (1986), the Court of InternationalTrade held that the Department must either promulgate a rule in accordancewith the Administrative Procedures Protective Act establishing 0.5 percentas the <T3>de minimis</T3> standard for its determinations or must explain thebasis for each individual determination in which it decides that a weighted-averagedumping margin below 0.5 percent is <T3>de minimis.</T3> The Department has elected to promulgate a rule establishing0.5 percent as the <T3>de minimis</T3> standard for all antidumping and countervailing dutydeterminations, which is now final, 52 FR 30660-30662, (August 17, 1987).This rule adds andSection; 353.24 to the antidumping regulations and andSection;355.8 to the countervailing duty regulations.<T3>Comment 15:</T3> Zenith contends that the Department's failure to performverification allowed the respondents to distort their calculations. TheDepartment must continue to make the same changes in corresponding claimssubmitted for this review as it did following verification in the firstannual review.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>In accordance with section 776 of the Act,it is the Department's practice to conduct verifications only when we receivea request for revocation from a respondent or when we receive a requestfrom the domestic industry and have not conducted a verification duringthe previous two reviews. We conducted a verification in the previous administrativereview of this case. We agree with Zenith concerning consistency with ourconsideration of claims in the previous review. However, adjustments weremade based upon verified information in the first review and concernedclerical or methodological errors specific to that review. Where circumstanceshave differed in this review, <T3>i.e., </T3>where respondents have corrected such errors, we have notmade adjustments to corresponding claims. Where the information presentedindicates that circumstances have remained constant, <T3>i.e., </T3>where respondents have not corrected such errors, we havemade adjustments to the data as we did in the previous review.<T3>Comment 16: </T3>Zenith asserts that certain of AOC's model comparisonsdo not reflect the greatest degree of physical similarity available. TheDepartment's statement regarding the ESP comparisons suggests that an apparentlyidentical model was rejected in favor of an apparently less similar match.At the same time, a match between apparently very similar models was rejectedin favor of a match between evidently less similar models. Zenith urgesthe Department to ensure that all information from the record of the precedingreview which it considered in arriving at its decision in this review iscontained in the administrative record of this review.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>We agree with Zenith's model match commentsand have corrected the error to use those matches which are most similar.We have also incorporated any data used from our previous analysis intothe record of the current review.<T3>Comment 17: </T3>Zenith maintains that the Department should resolvethe inconsistency in its treatment of AOC's home market commissions. IfAOC paid no home market commissions, then the Department should make noprovision for the adjustment to home market price by whatever values mayappear in AOC's data set for the commission variable. If on the other hand,home market commissions were paid, then the Department may not adjust foreignmarket value by any more than the difference between home market and U.S.commissions. To provide adjustments both for home market commissions andfor an offset of U.S. commissions risks the calculation of artificiallylow foreign market values resulting from two downward adjustments, whenonly one is justified.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>We agree and have corrected the error.AOC paid no commissions in the home market.<T3>Comment 18: </T3>The petitioners and Zenith challenge AOC's claim forcommission income realized on export sales. They maintain that the tradingcompany's payments to AOC were not revenue from the sale of color televisions,but payments for services and, if allowed, should be considered only asan offset to AOC's indirect selling expenses.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>We agree and have denied the claim.<T3>Comment 19: </T3>Zenith notes several errors in Hitachi's cost of productionfigures. Zenith and the petitioners urge the Department to include theadditional constructed value information supplied by Hitachi. In addition,the Department should apply an inflation factor to certain of the costfigures or at least account for the lengthy period from production to saleduring which Hitachi was carrying these unsold receivers.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>We have corrected the errors in Hitachi'sconstructed value calculations. According to section 773(e)(1)(A) of theAct, constructed value must consist of all fabrication costs associatedwith the merchandise. We used the costs of those color televisions whichwere produced closest to the date of exportation. Hitachi reported theactual costs to produce this merchandise and we have used these costs inour final determination.The cost of carrying merchandise in inventory is indirect and is not absorbedby one particular television set, but by the company's entire operations.It is not necessary to specifically allocate indirect expense to particularmodels or sales. Therefore, we have used Hitachi's average inventory carryingcosts in our final determination. Also, we did not find a high rate ofinflation in Taiwan warranting an adjustment to the costs that were actuallyincurred.<T3>Comment 20: </T3>Zenith points to several clerical errors in Hitachi'swarranty claim. The petitioners maintain that the Department should treatthe labor portion of Hitachi's U.S. warranty claim as a direct expensebecause it is not clear whether the labor services were performed withinthe company or by outside service centers.Hitachi objects to the Department's model-by-model treatment of warrantyexpenses. It contends that the facts of this case justify the use of anaverage warranty cost based on historical experience in order to avoidthe distortions that arise from deducting the specific amount of warrantyexpense incurred for each model sold during the period, including discontinuedmodels and new models.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>We have corrected all the warranty errorsnoted by Zenith. We agree with the petitioners that the labor portion ofHitachi's warranty is a direct expense. The majority of labor performedwas completed by outside service centers. We have continued to calculatewarranty claims on a model-by-model basis, except where the warranty claimsexceeded actual sales revenue of the model during the period of review.In such instances, we have allocated actual warranty costs of a model andits successor over sales of both models. This allocation, in our view,offers the best approximation of the eventual warranty costs for the salesunder consideration.<T3>Comment 21: </T3>Zenith maintains that Hitachi's response does notcontain an explanation for negative quantities of sales which appear tobe the equivalent of a rebate in other uncancelled sales to that customer.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>The negative sales quantities in Hitachi'sresponse were caused by credit memos which reflect price changes or corrections.<T3>Comment 22: </T3>Zenith asserts that Shin-Shirasuna made sales of certainmodels to Canada below cost. The sales below cost meet the ten percentguideline and should not be used in the margin analysis. Zenith also contendsthat each cost of production calculated is understated.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>In our cost of production analysis forsales to Canada, we found a clerical error. With this correction, we havefound certain sales to Canada to be below their costs of production. Weexcluded these sales from our consideration of sales to Canada as the basisfor foreign market value.   <T3>Comment 23:</T3> Zenith points to discrepancies in bank commissionson third-country sales made by Shin-Sirasuna. It states that certain bankcommission charges used in the Department's analysis are too high.   <T3>Department's Position: </T3>The differences between Shin-Shirasuna'ssubmission and certain bank charges used in the Department's analysis,noted by Zenith, derive from the Department's use of weight-averaging ofbank commissions on third-country sales.  <T3>Comment 24:</T3> Zenith and the petitioners contend that, if subcontractorcosts cover the purchase of direct materials and/or direct labor, theyshould be included in the differences in merchandise calculation for Shin-Shirasuna.In addition, the petitioners remark that Shin-Shirasuna has not reportedany variable overhead costs in its physical difference claim. These directoverhead costs for color televisions should be broken out and taken intoaccount.   <T3>Department's Position: </T3>Shin-Shirasuna states that it does notdistinguish between fixed and variable components in its subcontractorcost. Therefore, we have treated these costs as variable expenses and haveincluded this component in calculating the adjustment for differences inthe physical characteristics of the merchandise. Shin-Shirasuna did notreport any variable overhead costs in its physical difference claims becauseit claims that its factory overhead expenses are essentially fixed in nature.We have reviewed Shin-Shirasuna's response and agree with their assessment. <T3>Comment 25:</T3> Zenith notes in the final determination in the precedingreview, the Department correctly ruled that for purposes of antidumpingcalculations the cost of parts purchased by Shin-Shirasuna Taiwan fromShin-Shirasuna Japan is Shin-Shirasuna Taiwan's purchase price, not Shin-ShirasunaJapan's acquisition cost as Shin-Shirasuna had claimed. It appears that,in this review, the Department has employed Shin-Shirasuna Japan's acquisitioncost rather than Shin-Shirasuna Taiwan's purchase price for calculatingcertain differences in merchandise adjustments.   <T3>Department's Position: </T3>In this review, Shin-Shirasuna Taiwan didnot purchase parts from Shin-Shirasuna Japan. Therefore, we have used theprices as reported.  <T3>Comment 26:</T3> Zenith maintains that Shin-Shirasuna's material costdifferences yield a lower difference than is justified by the parts listsubmitted in the original questionnaire response.   <T3>Department's Position: </T3>Zenith has miscalculated Shin-Shirasuna'sdifference in merchandise adjustments. Shin-Shirasuna's parts lists containall parts included in the production of these models. When we calculateour difference in merchandise adjustment, we look only to those factorsthat are uniquely associated with the cost of manufacture of the physicaldifferences. This does not include price differences of identical parts,as represented by Zenith's calculation.  <T3>Comment 27:</T3> Zenith requests that the Department determine whetherthere is an overlap between the costs reported by Shin-Shirasuna in thedifferences in merchandise and the packing costs data.   <T3>Department's Position: </T3>Shin-Shirasuna provided separate listsfor packing materials and materials pertaining to its difference in merchandiseclaims. We have no evidence that costs reported in one list overlappedwith costs reported in the other.  <T3>Comment 28:</T3> Zenith states that a number of sales appear to bemissing from Shin-Shirasuna's final submission.   <T3>Department's Position: </T3>Shin-Shirasuna has corrected the errorand has submitted the additional U.S. sales. We have included these salesin our analysis.  <T3>Comment 29:</T3> Zenith and the petitioners question Shin-Shirasuna'sfailure to report a stamp tax, when all other Taiwanese firms have indicatedpayment of this internal tax. In addition, the petitioners contend thatan export promotion fee should be deducted from U.S. price.   <T3>Department's Position: </T3>We agree and have adjusted our calculationsto include a stamp tax on all sales exported from Taiwan. Shin-Shirasunaincluded the stamp tax in its general and administrative expenses in constructedvalue. We have taken this item out of the constructed value calculationsand made the appropriate deduction from U.S. price. The export promotionfee was included in the bank charges category and we deducted this amountfrom U.S. price.  <T3>Comment 30:</T3> The petitioners maintain that Tatung's home marketdiscounts and rebates should be considered indirect selling expenses, forwhich no circumstance-of-sale adjustments are warranted, because they arenot directly related to home market sales under review. Certain of theincentive programs are triggered not by sales of the subject color televisions,but by a dealer's purchases over time of various consumer products in sufficientoverall values and/or quantities to be eligible for the incentives. Otherprograms are similarly triggered not by sales of Tatung's color televisions,but by either a separate and subsequent transaction, such as a trade-infor which Tatung pays for value received, or by the quantity of a dealer'soverall purchases of consumer products generally from Tatung.   <T3>Department's Position: </T3>We disagree. We have continued to acceptTatung's discount and rebate claims as directly related to sales and deductedthese claims from foreign market value as we did in our preliminary determination.When rebate programs were based on a variety of products, Tatung correctlyallocated a proportionate share of the rebates to sales of comparison televisionmodels in the home market. <T3>See </T3>the <T3>Study of Antidumping Adjustment Methodology and Recommendations forStatutory Change, </T3>(November, 1985), p. 60. However, we agree withpetitioners concerning rebates paid on trade-ins of merchandise and havecontinued to exclude this portion of Tatung's rebate claim.  <T3>Comment 31:</T3> Zenith maintains that the general and administrativeexpenses included in Sampo's constructed value calculations appear to beunderstated. Sampo should have generated the percentage figure by allocatingfinancing and general expenses over cost of goods sold instead of allocatingits expense over sales value.<T3>Department's Position:</T3> The allocation of financing and generalexpenses over costs of goods sold was reflected in our preliminary determination.We have continued to follow this methodology in our final determination.<T3>Comment 32:</T3> Zenith states that the Department failed to performa cost of production test on Sampo's sales in the home market. During thepreceding review, Sampo claimed circumstance-of-sale adjustment amountswhich, in the aggregate, reduced constructed value to below the cost ofmanufacture.<T3>Department's Position:</T3> Zenith did not provide any ``reasonablegrounds to believe or suspect'' that Sampo's sales were below cost, asdefined in section 773(b) of the Act. The only basis for Zenith's costallegation was a clerical error from the previous review. Because we correctedthat error in the previous review's final results, we did not considerZenith's allegations as still valid.<T3>Comment 33:</T3> The petitioners and Zenith claim that Fulet incorrectlyallocated its home market advertising expenses. They request that all Fulet'sgeneral television home market advertising expenses be allocated over salesof all home market color televisions, not just the comparison models. Zenithasserts that Fulet has not provided the information necessary to determinethe appropriate attribution and/or allocation of the expenses that mayqualify for an adjustment and that Fulet has claimed more than the entireamount of advertising expenses it incurred. Zenith also contends that certaincategories of Fulet's advertising expenses are not directly attributableto comparison model sales and some categories are not eligible as circumstance-of-saleadjustments at all. In addition, the petitioners point to pre-paid advertisingexpenses in Fulet's financial statements amortized over several years.All of these advertising expenses should be excluded from Fulet's claimedhome market advertising adjustment.<T3>Department's Position:</T3> Fulet correctly allocated its home marketadvertising expenses according to the methodology delineated in our questionnaire.We found certain clerical errors in Fulet's advertising calculations, however,and have corrected them in our final determination. Since all of Fulet'shome market sales are sales of comparison models, all color televisionadvertising is incurred in connection with the sales during the reviewperiod. Fulet provided the Department with primary source documents fromwhich it determined per-model expenses. These direct and indirect expensesare the total of advertising costs reported by Fulet for the review period.For an explanation of the pre-paid advertising expense, <T3>see</T3> Comment 35.<T3>Comment 34:</T3> Zenith submits that the Department must conduct acost of production examination of all Fulet's accommodation sales.<T3>Department's Position:</T3> We disagree. Zenith had sufficient informationprior to the preliminary determination concerning Fulet's accommodationsales to allow the filing of a timely allegation of sales at less thanthe cost of production. Absent such an allegation sufficiently prior tothe preliminary determination to allow for collection and analysis of costdata, we will not institute a cost of production inquiry. <T3>See,</T3> 51 FR 29046, andSection;353.31(c)(ii), August 13, 1986.<T3>Comment 35:</T3> Zenith and the petitioners allege that Fulet has understatedits U.S. advertising expenses. Fulet should provide an explanation of thederivation of its direct advertising expenses and reallocate cooperativeadvertising only over the color televisions sold in the U.S. Fulet shouldalso explain whether it included export-related advertising expenses incurredin the home market in its U.S. claim. In addition, the petitioners claimthat an advertising expense clearly resulted from Fulet's barter transactionand that this expense should be accounted for as a U.S. advertising expense.<T3>Department's Position:</T3> Fulet claimed only a portion of total advertisingexpenses as a direct adjustment to U.S. price. This is the figure quotedby the petitioners. The remainder is included in indirect expenses. Fulet'sallocation of cooperative advertising is based on sales value and pertainsonly to the U.S. model that received this form of advertising. Fulet alsoincluded export-related advertising expenses in its indirect expense category.We have accepted Fulet's allocation of its U.S. advertising expenses aswe have no basis not to. As for Fulet's barter transaction, Fulet receiveda credit towards future advertising in the U.S. in exchange for the subjectcolor televisions. Because the credit for advertising services receivedfrom this transaction was not used until the subsequent review period,we have deferred action on this matter in this review.<T3>Comment 36:</T3> Zenith requests that the Department examine its constructedvalue calculation for Nettek. In all probability, the difference in merchandiseadjustment should be removed.<T3>Department's Position:</T3> Since we constructed the value of similar,not such merchandise, an adjustment for physical differences was necessary.<T3>Comment 37:</T3> The petitioners request that the Department investigatecertain volume discrepancies in the various submissions made by Hitachi,RCA, Shin-Shirasuna, and Tatung.<T3>Department's Position:</T3> The discrepancies noted by the petitionerswere caused by clerical errors in the programming, in the case of Tatung,and by missing U.S. sales in Shin-Shirasuna's calculations. We have correctedboth errors. The sales figures for Hitachi questioned by the petitionersare for imports of the merchandise from Taiwan and not sales in the UnitedStates. RCA's initial sales figures were incomplete and were subsequentlyrevised.<T3>Comment 38:</T3> The petitioners contend that they are impaired intheir analysis by the lack of access to documents considered verificationexhibits by respondents. When no verification is conducted, there shouldbe no ``verification exhibits.''<T3>Department's Position:</T3> It is our policy not to release a respondent'ssupporting source documents under an administrative protective order whenwe have requested this additional information solely to further clarifya respondent's claim. Release of such documents can be damaging to thecompetitive position of the respondent. If petitioners did not agree withour position, the proper remedy was to appeal to the Court of InternationalTrade while this review was in progress. 19 U.S.C. 1677(f)(c)(2).<T3>Comment 39:</T3> The petitioners believe that the tentative determinationto revoke with respect to Capetronic is premature. It is not clear thatthere have been no sales at less than fair value for at least two years.Moreover, the first review's results as to Capetronic are being appealed.<T3>Department's Position:</T3> The Department has established 0.5 percentas the <T3>de minimis </T3>standard for its determination, 52 FR 30660-30662,(August 17, 1987). Capetronic has had <T3>de minimis </T3>margins for at least two years. We are proceeding withthe revocation process with regard to Capetronic. Under section 516A ofthe Act, petitioners may contest the Department's decision to revoke itsorder with respect to Capetronic. <T3>See</T3> 19 U.S.C. 1516A(a)(2)(B)(iii). <T3>Comment 40:</T3> The petitioners maintain that the Department failedto analyze sales between AOC and an unrelated trading company as purchaseprice transactions. The sales invoice between AOC-Taipei and the unrelatedtrading company shows that AOC knew at the time of sale that the merchandisewas destined for the United States. In the past, the Department has analyzedsuch sales as purchase price transactions. <T3>Department's Position: </T3>We disagree. AOC controlled the price bythe unrelated trading company to both related and unrelated U.S. purchasers.The unrelated trading company only served to facilitate the export of themerchandise. In this situation, we regard the trading company as actingonly as an agent of AOC. <T3>Comment 41: </T3>The petitioners state that the sales AOC made to unrelatedbuyers with terms confirmed by AOC-USA before the date of importation shouldbe analyzed as ESP transactions and not purchase price transactions. Theymaintain that AOC-Taipei did not ship to an unrelated customer and thatAOC-USA did not act solely as a processor of sales-related documentation,but clearly functioned as the U.S. marketing arm of AOC-Taipei. <T3>Department's Position: </T3>We disagree. We have continued to treatthese transactions as purchase price sales because AOC's subsidiary inthe U.S. serves merely as the facilitator of the transaction and importerof record for the merchandise and not the U.S. marketing arm of AOC-Tapei.The merchandise was shipped directly from the manufacturer to the unrelatedparty without being introduced into the inventory of the other party. Thiswas the customary commercial channel for sales between the parties involved.Furthermore, the subsidiary acted only as a processor of sales-relateddocumentation and a communication link with the unrelated U.S. buyer. <T3>Comment 42:</T3> The petitioners contend that the Department incorrectlyaccepted AOC's reported claim that all of its U.S. advertising expenseswere directed at the trade rather than end-users. They assert that AOC-USAhas been participating in some kind of dealer cooperative advertising program.The Department should reject AOC's U.S. advertising claim and use the bestinformation available. The best information available would be to offsetcompletely the direct advertising expenses claimed by AOC on its home marketsales. <T3>Department's Position: </T3>The Department is satisfied with the informationwe received from AOC. We have not changed our analysis of AOC's U.S. advertisingclaim. <T3>Comment 43: </T3>The petitioners believe that AOC's and Tatung's dutydrawback and commodity tax claims were based on an unfair duty-paying valueand should be denied by the Department. <T3>Department's Position:</T3> Each firm determines the duty-paying valuefor its merchandise. The customs authority in Taiwan periodically verifiesthis information. Based on these facts, the Department has accepted eachrespondent's methodology in calculating its duty drawback and commoditytax claims. <T3>Comment 44:</T3> The petitioners contend that the Department erredin its preliminary analysis by comparing AOC's sales of certain U.S. modelswith home market sales of certain models made at prices below their costof production. The Department should disregard all home market sales atprices below the cost of production in its final analysis. <T3>Department's Position:</T3> We disagree. The petitioners had sufficientinformation prior to the preliminary determination concerning AOC's salesto allow the filing of a timely allegation of sales at less than the costof production. Absent such an allegation sufficiently prior to the preliminarydetermination to allow for collection and analysis of cost data, we willnot institute a cost of production inquiry. <T3>Comment 45: </T3>The petitioners request that the Department shoulddetermine, prior to its final analysis, whether AOC and its selling agentwere ``related parties'' within the meaning of the law and whether thehome market sales are suitable to use for comparison purposes. AlthoughAOC claims that prices to its selling agent were negotiated solely on thebasis of market value, this claim does not appear to be supported by thesales price information on the record. <T3>Department's Position:</T3> From the documents AOC submitted detailingits relationship with its selling agent, the Department determined thatAOC and its selling agent were ``related parties'' for only the first quarterof the review period. During this period, we used sales between the relatedselling agent and unrelated dealers in the home market in our analysis.When AOC divested itself of all shares in the company serving as sellingagent, they were no longer ``related parties'' within the meaning of section771(13) of the Act. We then used sales between AOC and the unrelated sellingagent in our analysis. <T3>Comment 46: </T3>The petitioners assert that the Department shoulddeny the portion of AOC's home market inland freight claim associated withowning trucks, including salaries of the drivers. These expenses are partof general overhead costs and as such cannot be tied directly to salesof color televisions in the home market. <T3>Department's Position:</T3> We disagree. Since these expenses mustbe deducted from USP, it is necessary to also deduct them from home marketselling prices to achieve a proper comparison. AOC reported the underlying<T3>cost</T3> (not a transfer price) of providing the inland freight service.We have accepted this cost as a reasonable proxy for an unrelated transactionprice and have deducted said cost from foreign market value. <T3>Comment 47:</T3> The petitioners contend that the Department erredin allowing AOC's home market rebate claims in its preliminary analysis.AOC claimed rebates on models not eligible to receive the rebates and didnot claim amounts for rebates actually paid during the period of review.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>AOC based its rebate claim on rebates actuallypaid during the review period. The discrepancies noted by petitioners werecaused by clerical errors in AOC's submission which have been corrected.<T3>Comment 48: </T3>In regard to AOC's home market warranty expenses,the petitioners state that only those expenses incurred during the periodof review should be considered appropriate for adjustment purposes. Inaddition, the Department should not allow AOC's claim for material expenses.Since AOC provided its selling agent with free replacement parts, any valuethat the selling agent assigned to these parts for purposes of its warrantyexpense claim does not necessarily reflect an arm's length value. AOC shouldalso be required to confirm that it incurred no U.S. warranty expensesduring the period of review on sales of certain models.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>We agree. We have included only warrantyexpenses incurred during the review period in our final analysis. However,we have continued to allow AOC's claim for material expenses. In both theU.S. and home market warranty calculations, AOC claimed its acquisitioncost and not the retail value of the replacement parts. AOC reported itsU.S. warranty costs on a model-specific basis in its response to the Department'squestionnaire.<T3>Comment 49: </T3>The petitioners contend that the Department shouldallow only the taxes paid by AOC's selling agent during the period whenthe two companies were related because the sales to the first unrelatedhome market customers were made by the selling agent during this period.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>We agree. For the period in question, wehave disallowed AOC's stamp tax as an expense directly related to salesby the related selling agent because only the related selling agent's stamptax expense was the result of the sale to the first unrelated customer.However, we have allowed AOC's stamp tax as an indirect expense in ourfinal calculations.<T3>Comment 50: </T3>The petitioners state that the Department failed todeduct export duties on U.S. sales paid by AOC to the China External DevelopmentCouncil in its preliminary analysis.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>We disagree. These export duties were includedin bank charges.<T3>Comment 51: </T3>The petitioners request that Fulet explain or correctthe inconsistent sales volumes reported in its responses.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>The petitioners have mistaken Fulet's listof shipments to the U.S. for sales. Model P619 was sold from stock; itwas not shipped during the review period. The inconsistency in sales listingsin Fulet's response was caused by one list including returns.<T3>Comment 52: </T3>The petitioners contend that Fulet overstated itshome market inland freight claim. Fulet's terms of sale on its home marketcolor television sales appear to be ex-warehouse and no downward adjustmentto foreign market value is warranted for inland freight. The adjustmentshould be restricted to no more than those expenses that are directly relatedto the color televisions under review. Any inland freight adjustment shouldnot reflect costs entailed in the delivery of merchandise other than colortelevisions.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>Fulet's terms of sale include the freightexpenses to its customers. However, we agree with the petitioners thatany adjustment for inland freight expenses should be restricted to no morethan those expenses that are associated with the color televisions underreview.We have corrected this error in our final analysis. <T3>See</T3> also Comment 46.<T3>Comment 53: </T3>The petitioners ask that Fulet be required to substantiatethat its cash discounts were based on the gross invoice price and documentthat timely payment was received on the home market color television saleson which the cash discount was earned. Furthermore, Fulet should demonstratethat early payment discounts claimed were actually awarded on its specifiedhome market color television sales. The petitioners disagree with Fuletthat only those home market sales should be used for comparison purposesto which the volume discount program applied. They state that no adjustmentfor volume discounts on accommodation sales should be awarded. In addition,they note a discrepancy in Fulet's volume discount and rebate expensesthat has exaggerated these claims. The petitioners assert that Fulet's``other discounts'' should be denied because none of these discounts isdirectly related to sales in Taiwan of the color televisions under reveiw.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>All of Fulet's discount claims, includingearly payment discounts, were prepared using a dealer-by-dealer, sale-by-salemethodology. The Department is satisfied with this methodology. Accommodationsales received no volume discounts. In our preliminary determination, weused all home market sales for our comparisons, and not only those to whichvolume discounts applied. We have continued to use this methodology inour final determination. The explanation of figures cited in petitioners'comment is incorrect. The amount stated as Fulet's total color televisiondiscounts and rebates in 1985 is actually the total for color televisionsand stereos. As for ``other discounts,'' Fulet allocated the amount ofthese expenses to color television receivers in its indirect expense adjustment.We have accepted this calculation.<T3>Comment 54: </T3>The petitioners contend that because Fulet's homemarket ``one-price'' rebates appear to apply to a limited number of homemarket sales, the Department should not apply these expenses to all homemarket sales.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>We disagree. Fulet's ``one-price'' rebateprogram applies to all sales of the home market merchandise and was paidto all dealers. We have continued to allow an adjustment for this programin our final analysis.<T3>Comment 55: </T3>The petitioners assert that Fulet's actual creditterms on a sale-by-sale basis should be used rather than an averaging ofhome market credit costs. They ask for clarification as to whether Fulet'sshort-term borrowings were truly at arm's length. The home market accountsreceivable should be net of any bad debt and trading loss allowances. Itis not clear that Fulet has done so in this regard. Fulet should reviseits accounts receivable calculations to include only color television creditsales. The petitioners believe that the credit period derived by Fuleterroneously overvalues the cost of credit on its home market sales of colortelevisions. In addition, the accounts receivable turnover ratio shouldignore Fulet's notes receivable figure entirely. The figure used by Fuletis overstated because it includes all dealer sales of whatever productand not just sales of color televisions.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>The Department is satisfied that the imputedmethod based on the average balance of accounts receivable accurately reflectsthe credit costs Fulet incurred on sales of the merchandise. We have nobasis to believe that bad debt and trading loss allowances were includedin Fulet's accounts receivable or that its short-term loans were not atarm's length. Fulet's accounts receivable ledger consists of all consumerelectronics products. It does not maintain a separate account for colortelevision receivers. Therefore, we calculated the credit expense associatedwith all consumer products. We have continued to allow Fulet's notes receivablein its credit calculation as we did in the previous review. The petitioners'interpretation of Fulet's financial statement is incorrect. The figurepresented as the 1985 notes receivables from dealer sales is merely anadjusted amount for notes receivable that was added to accounts receivableat the end of the year. We have accepted Fulet's calculation of creditexpenses in our final analysis as it accords with our methodology.<T3>Comment 56: </T3>The petitioners maintain that the labor portions ofFulet's technicians' salaries and employee insurance should be disregardedas indirect overhead. Travel expenses should be disallowed unless theyare directly related to the servicing of color televisions. If employee-ownedvehicles are part of employees' compensation, or used for purposes otherthan servicing color televisions, these expenses are indirect and shouldnot be allowed.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>We disagree. We regard technicians' salariesand employee insurance as indirect warranty expenses. <T3>See </T3>our <T3>Study of Antidumping Adjustments Methodology and Recommendations forStatutory Change, </T3>(November, 1985), p. 46. In our questionnaire werequest each respondent to submit <T3>actual </T3>warranty expenses related to sales of the merchandise duringthe period of review and to identify which elements are fixed or variableexpenses. We have no basis to believe that travel expenses were not directlyrelated to the servicing of color televisions.<T3>Comment 57: </T3>The petitioners maintain that if there were no salesof model P619 by Fulet in the United States, then the home market salesof this model should be disregarded. Given that this model was defectiveand quickly gave way to replacement models, the home market sales of thismodel should be rejected as a basis for comparison because these saleswere not made in the ordinary course of trade. The warranty expenses forthis model are more accurately considered as design and engineering costsfor which no circumstance-of-sale adjustment should be granted.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>We disagree. This model was sold in theordinary course of trade in Taiwan and there were sales of the model inthe U.S. during the review period. However, we have employed the methodologystated in Comment 20 above in order to account for the excessive warrantyclaims over the review period.<T3>Comment 58: </T3>The petitioners contend that Hitachi's use of weightedaverages in reporting U.S. movement charges distorts the margins and, therefore,should be rejected. Ocean freight charges varied significantly during thereview period. Hitachi's claim that it could not trace actual movementcharges incurred on sales under review is not credible.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>We disagree. Whenever possible the Departmentcalculates movement charges based on actual costs for each sale. However,we use average movement charges on a model-by-model basis when, as here,transaction-by-transaction cost information is not available. See <T3>Portable Electric Typewriters from Japan, </T3>(48 FR 40764, September9, 1983).<T3>Comment 59: </T3>The petitioners contend that Hitachi failed to complywith the Department's request to supply information on its discounts ona sale-by-sale basis. The Department should adjust U.S. price downwardin its final analysis by the largest discount amount reported in Hitachi'sresponse as the best information available.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>We disagree. Hitachi does not maintaina separate record that tabulates the amount of discounts granted. SinceHitachi's sales are negotiated on a case-by-case basis and not accordingto regulated discount schedules, we have used the invoice price net ofdiscounts as the starting price in our calculations.<T3>Comment 60: </T3>The petitioners maintain that the average short-terminterest rate reported by Hitachi in its U.S. credit calculation is abnormallylow. Unless the Department can satisfy itself that Hitachi has not understatedits reported interest rate, the Department should use the published short-terminterest rate in effect during the review period in its calculations.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>Hitachi did not use the internal averageshort-term interest rate reported in its questionnaire response. Hitachidivided total short-term interest for the review period by total salesvalue. As this calculation of credit was higher than the Department's imputedmethodology, we have used Hitachi's credit expense in our final determination.<T3>Comment 61: </T3>The petitioners claim that it is unclear whether depreciationand labor costs have been included in Hitachi's U.S. warehousing expenses.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>According to the warehousing contractssupplied by Hitachi and its financial statements, all costs associatedwith warehouses rented or owned have been included in Hitachi's claim.<T3>Comment 62: </T3>The petitioners request that prior to any final analysis,Hitachi should be required to submit the total amount of cooperative advertisingexpenses per customer so that the accuracy of its allocation methodologycan be assessed.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>In response to the Department's request,Hitachi revised its U.S. advertising claim to provide customer-specificinformation. We have accepted this revised calculation.<T3>Comment 63: </T3>The petitioners contend that Hitachi's U.S. administrativeexpenses appear to be grossly understated. Because Hitachi has failed tosupply the necessary supporting documentation either in the form of a listof individual expense items or the financial statements for Hitachi SalesCorporation of America (``HSCA''), the Department should use Hitachi Ltd.'sgeneral expenses as a surrogate for HSCA's general expenses in its finalanalysis.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>Hitachi submitted to the Department allfinancial statements for HSCA and Hitachi Sales Corp. of Hawaii (``HSCH''),including lists of the individual items. Based on this information, wehave continued to use the general expenses of HSCA and HSCH in our finalanalysis.<T3>Comment 64:</T3> The petitioners argue that Hitachi failed to reportexport promotion fees on its U.S. sales. The Department should adjust U.S.sales price downward by the amount of this expense in its final analysis.<T3>Department's Position:</T3> We agree and have made the deduction toU.S. price.<T3>Comment 65:</T3> The petitioners allege that the materials cost informationsubmitted by Hitachi for constructed value may not have included all ofthe expenses associated with preparing the material and parts for productioninto the finished product. They further assert that Hitachi's reportedstandard cost of materials and actual cost of materials reported on itsconstructed value calculations cannot be reconciled. The Department mustensure that any parts obtained by Hitachi (Television) Taiwan (``HTT'')for use in the production of the televisions under review are reportedat the cost HTT paid to obtain these parts, not the cost that HTT's parentor related parties paid for these parts. Hitachi's constructed value calculationsshould also include all taxes and movement charges for material purchasesand any adjustments for scrap or defective parts. Labor costs should bebased on actual cost data and must include all labor elements. The Departmentmust ascertain whether Hitachi was related to any subcontractors and whetherHitachi has accounted for any equipment lent to any subcontractors. Hitachiincorrectly allocated its factory overhead expenses and employed estimatesin its constructed value calculations. In addition, it is unclear whetherHitachi included an amount for depreciation expenses and research and developmentin its factory overhead calculations.<T3>Department's Position:</T3> Hitachi responded to the Department's constructedvalue questionnaire and has include all costs associated with the productionof the merchandise, including taxes, movement charges, and adjustmentsfor defective parts. Hitachi reported costs incurred by HTT and not theparent company. The differences between the labor and factory overheadallocation rates and actual labor and factory overhead are included inthe variance amounts. HTT is not related to its subcontractor. The Departmentis satisfied that all subcontractor costs and depreciation expenses wereincluded in HTT's constructed value calculations.<T3>Comment 66:</T3> The Petitioners contend that constructed value shouldbe the basis of comparison instead of Nettek's third-country sales. Theynote discrepancies in Nettek's response and request that the Departmentconfirm certain cost elements.<T3>Department's Position</T3>: The Department is satisfied that Nettekhas submitted accurate cost of production information with regard to itsthird-country sales. Where we used third-country sales in our analysis,we found these sales to be above their cost of production. We have continuedto use Nettek's sales to Chile in our final analysis. It is our policy,based on the legislative history of the 1979 Act, to use third-countrysales, where possible, rather than constructed value as a basis for comparisonin determining foreign market value. <T3>See </T3>also 19 CFR 353.4 (b). <T3>Comment 67</T3>: The petitioners allege that Nettek's sales to Chilewere below cost because Nettek undervalued its general, selling, and administrativeexpenses. Nettek has provided company-wide general expenses for all productsinstead of color television-specific expenses and has erroneously employedrelative sales values in lieu of the Department's long-standing practiceof using the relative cost of goods sold in its allocation. The petitionersurge that the Department use the general expense figure found from Nettek'sinternal financial statements in its sales below cost analysis. <T3>Department's Position</T3>: We agree with petitioners that Nettek'sgeneral and administrative expenses must be allocated over cost of goodssold. In our final determination, we have used Nettek's general and administrativeexpenses from its internal financial statements for color televisions becausethey more accurately capture the expenses associated with color televisions.<T3>Comment 68</T3>: The petitioners request that the Department employthe general expenses used in its sales below cost analysis in its constructedvalue calculations for Nettek. They maintain that constructed value shouldbe used as the basis for comparison for all sales to the U.S. because thethird-country merchandise was sold below cost. In addition, certain ofNettek's U.S. sales were not contemporaneous with any of the sales to Chile.<T3>Department's Position</T3>: For our constructed value calculations,we have continued to employ the ten percent statutory minimum for generalexpenses since, according to the methodology outlined in Comment 67, thegeneral, selling, and administrative expenses for third-country sales wereless than ten percent. The petitioners have misunderstood our use of the90/60 day contemporaneity rule. Nettek's U.S. sales were compared to salesto Chile up to 90 days back in time or 60 days forward from the date ofthe U.S. sale. Using this approach, we found contemporaneous third-countrysales. <T3>See </T3>also Comment 67. <T3>Comment 69</T3>: The petitioners request that the Department completea sales below cost analysis on Shin-Shirasuna's sales to Panama and reviseand update its sales below cost analysis on sales to Canada. The cost analysesfor sales to Panama and Canada must include the mark-up for parts purchasedfrom Shin-Shirasuna Japan, as well as all start-up costs involved in theproduction of the merchandise. In addition, Shin-Shirasuna has understatedits expenses and employed a weighted-average cost of materials insteadof providing lot-by-lot information. The petitioners conclude that theU.S. sales for which price-to-price comparisons have preliminarily beenmade against sales to Panama and Canada should instead be analyzed in termsof constructed value. <T3>Department's Position</T3>: The petitioners had sufficient informationprior to the preliminary determination concerning Shin-Shirasuna's salesto Panama to allow the filing of a timely allegation of sales at less thanthe cost of production. Absent such an allegation sufficiently prior tothe preliminary determination to allow for collection and analysis of costdata, we will not institute a cost of production inquiry of sales to Panama.See draft AD Regulations, 51 FR 29046 (August 13, 1986). With regard toour cost of production analysis on sales to Canada, we agree with the petitionersthat we must use the price Shin-Shirasuna Taiwan paid for the part. However,since Shin-Shirasuna Taiwan did not purchase parts from Shin-ShirasunaJapan, we have continued to use the prices as reported. We disagree thatwe incorrectly averaged production costs. We believe that the correct wayto compare material costs to selling price is by averaging the costs ofall production lots for the period because such an average best representsthe material costs over the period of review. We are satisfied that Shin-Shirasunaincluded all costs in its submission. We have continued to use sales toPanama and Canada in our final analysis. <T3>Comment 70</T3>: The petitioners argue that the Department should disregardcertain Shin-Shirasuna Canadian sales made through an intermediary companysince these sales may have been negotiated in conjunction with certainsales to the United States. They note that the Canadian sales may not bedistinct from the United States sales. Therefore, the Department shoulddisregard these Canadian sales and base foreign market value on constructedvalue. <T3>Department's Position</T3>: For these final results, we have continuedto use the Canadian sales as the basis of foreign market value. Shin-Shirasunaknows at the time of sale to the unrelated intermediary company the destinationsof the televisions. This approach is consistent with our normal practiceof determining U.S. price and foreign market value when the seller knowsthe ultimate destination of the merchandise at the time of sale to an unrelatedparty. <T3>See, Certain Forged Crankshafts from Japan, </T3>52 FR 36984 (October2, 1987); <T3>Nylon Impression Fabric from Japan,</T3> 51 FR 15816 (April 2, 1987);<T3>see also, The Trade Agreements Act of 1979, Report on H.R. 4537 bythe Committee on Finance, United States Senate</T3>, 96th Cong., 1st Sess.94 (1979). <T3>Comment 71: </T3>The petitioners encourage the Department to determinethe foreign market value for Shin-Shirasuna with reference to its Japaneseparent's home market prices. All the statutory prerequisites under themultinational provision in section 773(d) of the Act are satisfied: Shin-Shirasunaand its Japanese parent are integral parts of a multinational corporation;Shin-Shirasuna in Taiwan had no home market sales of the merchandise; andthe Japanese parent's color television prices in Japan may be higher thanthe foreign market value of the televisions produced by Shin-Shirasunain Taiwan. <T3>Department's Position: </T3>We disagree. In order for the Departmentto make use of the special rule for certain multinational corporations,all criteria must be met. Petitioners did not provide sufficient evidencethat the foreign market value of such or similar merchandise produced inone or more of the facilities outside the country of exportation was higherthan the foreign market value of such or similar merchandise produced inthe facilities located in the country of exportation. Without such evidence,we cannot invoke this provision of the Act. <T3>Comment 72: </T3>The petitioners contend that only direct deliverycosts of Tatung's home market inland freight should be allowed. In addition,these direct costs should be prorated if the color television deliveriesincluded other products. For U.S. inland freight, the petitioners requestthat Tatung explain why the Taiwanese inland freight costs for U.S. salesof certain models appear low as compared to other models. <T3>Department's Position: </T3>In our final determination, we have allowedTatung's entire home market inland freight claim since these expenses wouldbe deducted from USP and it is necessary to deduct such expenses from homemarket price to achieve a proper comparison. <T3>See </T3>Comment 46. The Department is satisfied that Tatung appropriatelyallocated its U.S. inland freight costs to color television deliveries.<T3>Comment 73: </T3>The petitioners allege that Tatung may have overstatedits home market credit costs. Tatung's cost of credit should be a weighted-averageof only its commercial paper and bank loan rates and should not includeshort-term loans from its employees and subsidiaries. Tatung should alsosupply its actual credit experience on sales of color televisions in theUnited States. Tatung has understated the average period of time duringwhich it extended credit on its U.S. sales by calculating its accountsreceivable turnover ratio using the value of its total sales, not justcredit sales. The value of Tatung's U.S. c.o.d. and flooring sales on whichit extends no credit should be excluded. <T3>Department's Position: </T3>We do not consider employees to be relatedparties. Therefore, we have continued to include Tatung's short-term loansfrom its employees in our calculation of home market credit. Because loansfrom subsidiaries are not considered arm's length transactions, we havedisregarded such loans in our credit calculation. Tatung did not includec.o.d. and flooring sales in its calculation of the accounts receivableperiod for its U.S. credit adjustment. Flooring sales credit was calculatedseparately. The Department is satisfied that the imputed method based onthe average balance of accounts receivable accurately reflects the creditcosts Tatung incurred on sales of the merchandise. <T3>Comment 74: </T3>The petitioners state that Tatung's commissions toits salesmen on home market dealer sales are in reality intracorporatetransfers of funds, for which no downward adjustment to foreign marketshould be allowed. <T3>Department's Position: </T3>Commissions to unrelated salesmen in thehome market on comparison models are a direct deduction from foreign marketvalue. These expenses are incurred only because a particular sale is made.Such salesmen are not a part of the corporation and funds paid to themare not available for further use by the firm. <T3>Comment 75: </T3>Tatung's claimed home market warranty expenses forlabor costs, according to the petitioners, actually represent fixed overheadand should not be allowed as a downward adjustment to foreign market value.Tatung's servicemen are paid commissions in lieu of salaries. When thedealers have performed warranty work, Tatung should not be awarded a warrantyadjustment because Tatung cannot relate this compensation to the productsunder review. <T3>Department's Position: </T3>We disagree. We treated commissions toTatung's servicemen in the same manner as we treat commissions to salesmen.In response to the Department's deficiency letter, Tatung calculated warrantyexpenses incurred by dealers by inspecting each warranty repair slip andreporting all warranty costs for the comparison models. Thus, these expensesare directly related to the color televisions under review. <T3>Comment 76: </T3>In the opinion of the petitioners, Tatung's U.S. oceanfreight costs appear to be unduly low. <T3>Department's Position: </T3>We have no basis to disregard the oceanfreight expenses reported by Tatung in its questionnaire response and havecontinued to use these figures in our final determination. <T3>Comment 77: </T3>The petitioners request that the Department seek clarificationfrom Tatung that its claimed home market advertising expenses were directlyrelated to the subject color televisions. In addition, the Department shouldinquire whether Tatung's related U.S. subsidiary incurs any color televisionadvertising expenses on its own in the U.S. and why its home market advertisingclaim is greater than its U.S. claim.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>Tatung reported its home market and U.S.advertising according to the methodology in our questionnaire. We are satisfiedwith the response provided by Tatung and have no reason to believe theinformation submitted was inaccurate or otherwise insufficient.<T3>Comment 78: </T3>The petitioners note that, in many instances, Tatung'sTaiwan f.o.b. prices do not seem to correlate with the f.o.b. foreign portprices that result from the computer printouts when all movement chargesand direct and indirect selling expenses are subtracted from the U.S. unitprices. They are concerned that Tatung may have employed an unreasonablylow transfer price to its U.S. subsidiary as the basis for not only itsU.S. duty, but other U.S. selling and movement expenses as well.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>Tatung has supplied the Department withthe Taiwan f.o.b. prices of all sales to the United States. We have noreason to disregard Tatung's reported import duties or other expenses.The accuracy of the import duty is a matter for Customs to determine.<T3>Comment 79: </T3>According to the petitioners, it appears that Tatunghas inadvertently omitted bank negotiation and export customs brokeragefees from its deductions from U.S. price.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>These charges were included in the ``othercharge'' category in the computer printout.<T3>Comment 80: </T3>The petitioners contend that non-material expenses,such as freight charges relative to Tatung's physical difference in merchandise,insurance premiums, brokerage, commodity taxes and other internal taxes,import duties, and handling in bringing the materials to Tatung's facilities,are not within the realm of the difference in merchandise adjustment. Theguiding principle should be that only the cost differences actually dueto physical differences in the merchandise being compared should be considered.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>The Department has concluded that duty-paidparts do reflect the actual cost incurred by the manufacturer. <T3>See Color Television Receivers from Korea, </T3>(51 FR 41377, November14, 1986) and <T3>Bicycle Tubes and Tires from Taiwan, </T3>(48 FR 31691, July 11, 1983).The items cited by the petitioners are considered to be associated withthe cost of the differences, as they are necessary to bring the variousparts to the place of manufacture.<T3>Comment 81: </T3>The petitioners request that the Department determinehow Tatung's average time in inventory was calculated and ensure that theperiod covers the entire time from date of shipment in Taiwan to the dateof sale to the unrelated buyer in the U.S. In addition, they raise thequestion whether U.S. indirect selling expenses have been understated andhome market expenses have been overstated.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>Tatung's U.S. inventory carrying cost calculationsdid not include time on the water. We have added this period to our calculation.The Department is satisfied with Tatung's response to our questionnaireconcerning other home market and U.S. indirect selling expenses.<T3>Comment 82: </T3>In the calculations of Tatung's constructed value,the petitioners maintain that actual and not standard labor hours shouldbe used.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>Tatung's cost calculations include a varianceamount which is incorporated at the end of the year to adjust for the differencebetween standard and actual labor hours. We have included this amount inthe calculation of constructed value.<T3>Comment 83: </T3>Hitachi contends that the Department should use thequarterly exchange rates during the period of production in calculatingconstructed value rather than those in effect on the date of the U.S. sale.Hitachi's costs should not be quantified on the basis of fluctuations inexchange rates that occurred long after the time of production and importation.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>We disagree. The regulations provide forthe use of exchange rates as of the date of purchase, for purchase pricetransactions (<T3>see </T3>andSection;353.56(a) of the regulations), and the statute providesfor the use of exchange rates as of the time of the first sale in the U.S.to an unrelated customer for exporter's sales price transactions (<T3>see </T3>19 U.S.C. 1677b(a)(1)).<T3>Comment 84: </T3>Sampo claims that the Department should add travelexpenses and reworking costs to the warranty adjustment in the constructedvalue calculations. The Department has recognized these items as directwarranty expenses for the price-to-price comparisons. In addition, it requeststhat the Department include service costs and costs of unsellable setsas part of the direct warranty adjustment.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>We have corrected the error in Sampo'swarranty claim regarding the inclusion of travel expenses and reworkingcosts. However, we consider in-house service costs to be an indirect expense.<T3>See Television Receivers, Monochrome and Color, from Japan, </T3>(52FR 8945, March 20, 1987). The warranty portion claimed for the costs ofunsellable sets represents unrecovered production costs and not an expenseinvolved in servicing the sets under a warranty claim.<T3>Comment 85: </T3>Shin-Shirasuna requests that the Department rule thatmodel 5A3 is outside the scope of the antidumping duty order and recalculateShin-Shirasuna's weighted-average dumping margin.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>The Department determined this model tobe included in the scope of this order based on the criteria set forthin <T3>Diversified Products Corp. v. United States. </T3>(<T3>See </T3>the final results of the first administrative review in thiscase, Comment 49. Model 5A3 is the same as model EEE in the first review.)We have continued to include this model in the current review.<T3>Comment 86: </T3>Shin-Shirasuna alleges that the Department erred inusing sales to Jamaica, rather than constructed value, to calculate foreignmarket value. The sale to Jamaica falls outside the Department's contemporaneityrule and the quantity of units sold to Jamaica fails to meet the five percentadequacy test set forth in the Department's regulations for home marketsales which the Department applied to third-country sales by Shin-Shirasunain the first administrative review.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>In order for the Department to determinewhether a sale in the home or third-country market is contemporaneous,we must look at the 90/60 guideline. Because the sale to Jamaica was madeoutside this time period and there were comparatively few sets sold, wehave reconsidered our analysis and used constructed value in our finaldetermination as the best measurement of foreign market value. <ITAG tagnum="84">Final Results of the Review </ITAG>As a result of the comments received, we have determined that the followingweighted-average margins exist: <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L2,tp0,i1,s10,14,8 </C> <H1>Manufacturer/exporter</H1><H1>Time period</H1><H1>Margin (percent)</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">AOC International, Inc<D>4/1/85-3/31/86</D><D>0.03</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Capetronic (BSR) Ltd<D>4/1/85-5/29/86</D><D>.30</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Fulet Electronic Industrial Co., Ltd<D>4/1/85-3/31/86</D><D>.22</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Hitachi Television (Taiwan) Ltd<D>4/1/85-3/31/86</D><D>2.31</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Nettek Corp., Ltd<D>4/1/85-3/31/86</D><D>1.49</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">RCA Taiwan, Ltd<D>4/1/85-3/31/86</D><D>1.51</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Sampo Corp<D>4/1/85-3/31/86</D><D>.78</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Sanyo Electric (Taiwan) Co., Ltd<D>4/1/85-3/31/86</D><D>\1\ 4.66</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Shinlee Corp<D>4/1/85-3/31/86</D><D>\1\ 10.14</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Shin-Shirasuna Electric Co<D>4/1/85-3/31/86</D><D>.09</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Tatung Co<D>4/1/85-3/31/86</D><D>4.06</D><F>\1\ No shipments during the review period.</F></ITAG></ITAG>The Department will instruct the Customs Service to assess antidumpingduties on all appropriate entries.
