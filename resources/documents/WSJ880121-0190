Financial market traders say the statistics, announced Tuesday, were known several hours ahead of the release time.    As previously reported, Japan's total December surplus was $8.6 billion, of which $4.91 billion was with the U.S. Imports totaled $14.73 billion, while exports were $23.33 billion.    Traders who asked not to be identified say they knew of all these figures before the release, and that U.S. Treasury bonds and the dollar fell while Japanese government bonds rose as a result.    A Finance Ministry spokesman says a check by the export division of the customs and tariff bureau, which compiles the statistics, showed no leak had occurred from that department.    Some traders said Tuesday, and the Japanese newspaper Nihon Keizai Shimbun reported Wednesday, that there were rumors the trade data had been leaked by Japan's Ministry of Trade and Industry. Officials there were unavailable for comment.    The figures released Tuesday weren't the first in Japan's trade series to be leaked, traders say. Advance access to trade and several other Japanese economic indicators is &quot;a fact of life in Tokyo,&quot; says a bond trader here. </TEXT></DOC>
