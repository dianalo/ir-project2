Under a proposal unveiled by New Hampshire Gov. JuddGregg, the FDIC would join private investors in putting upthe capital necessary to finance mergers. The plan isdesigned to encourage intrastate mergers to cut costs andboost efficiency or to attract out-of-state banks to purchaseNew Hampshire institutions.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;We'll be happy to go either route,&quot; Gov. Gregg said. &quot;Ourbottom line is to create credit&quot; in a state where banks havebeen hit hard by the recession.   If the New Hampshire proposal works, it could serve as amodel for a public-private partnership to help problem banksin other states. &quot;We're happy that we may be able to comeforward with a joint plan&quot; with New Hampshire, FDIC ChairmanWilliam Seidman said.   Mr. Seidman has been searching for measures to promotebank mergers as a way to reduce the number of bank failures.The Bush administration and many banking industry analystscontend that a wave of consolidation among the nation's12,400 banks is one way to strengthen the industry.   The banking industry has been discussing ways to head offbank failures by promoting mergers. The industry and the FDICwant to make sure that government-assisted mergers actuallyrescue banks from failure, rather than merely delay failure.&quot;The key phrase is no forbearance,&quot; or no relaxation of soundbanking and regulatory standards, said Robert Dugger, chiefeconomist of the American Bankers Association. Thewillingness of private investors to put &quot;significantvoluntary capital at risk&quot; is the test that mergers must meetto show that there isn't forbearance, Mr. Dugger said.   The New Hampshire plan meets this test. It requires banksto find merger partners or other investors willing to put upprivate capital. After obtaining outside capital, the bankswould then go to the FDIC, which would consider making aninvestment in the merged bank to provide additional capital.   &quot;Our job is to be a catalyst,&quot; Gov. Gregg said. He isencouraging New Hampshire banks, many of which are losingmoney, to seek merger partners and capital infusions. &quot;We'rewaiting for banks to come forward&quot; with proposals, he said.&quot;They know that private capital has to be part of theequation.&quot;   Mr. Seidman has agreed that the FDIC would consider makingan investment, perhaps in the form of preferred stock, tobolster the private investment in the merged institution.   Many details remain to be worked out. &quot;We haven't debatedas yet what to expect of the acquiring institution and whatto expect of the acquired institution,&quot; said Roger Watson,the FDIC's director of research. Another question is howstock and bondholders in the acquired institution would farein a merger.   Neither Mr. Seidman nor Gov. Gregg would predict when amerger might be wrapped up, but they said they want to movequickly. According to the American Banker, which firstdisclosed elements of the merger plan, the five largestbanking companies in New Hampshire -- Amoskeag Bank Shares,BankEast Corp., Dartmouth Bancorp., New Hampshire SavingsBank Corp. and Numerica Financial Corp. -- are all losingmoney.   In recent weeks, the New England congressional delegationhas been pushing the administration to come up with ways toease the credit crunch in the region. Although the FederalReserve Board has lowered interest rates, businesses stillfind it difficult to borrow money from loss-ridden banks. ButGov. Gregg and Mr. Seidman believe that an FDIC willingnessto help finance bank mergers would help attract capital intothe area.</TEXT></DOC>
