The selected generatorsare instrumented and operated by Electricite de France (EdF) at the Bugey-4and Tricastin-1 power plants. The computer code used is ATHOS3, whichis designed for three-dimensional, two-phase, steady-state and transientthermal-hydraulic analysis of U-Tube I (UTSG) and Once-Through (OTSG)steam generators. The purpose of the study is to verify the ATHOS3 code.</TEXT></DOC>
