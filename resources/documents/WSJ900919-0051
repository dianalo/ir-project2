While calling the company's latest package a &quot;serious&quot;offer, Robert White, president of the Canadian Auto Workersunion, said the proposal still fell short of many of the theunion's minimum demands in important areas such as wages,additional holiday time, job security and fringe benefits.</LP><TEXT>   The union leader appeared to back away from his earlierthreats to abandon the bargaining table, and he saidnegotiations would continue in an effort to reach a contractsettlement.   Ford has &quot;obviously rejected a number of our bottom-lineproposals. We'll have to see if we can do anything about thatin the next couple of days,&quot; Mr. White said.   Donald McKenzie, Ford Canada's chief negotiator, said thecompany's latest offer was a &quot;significant improvement&quot; overits first proposal made last week, which was swiftly rejectedby the union. The CAW has made clear it didn't dispute the&quot;direction&quot; of the offer, but rather the amount of money puton the table.   &quot;My sense is {the new offer} will move things forwardrapidly,&quot; Mr. McKenzie said. He wouldn't provide details ofthe latest package.   The strike by Ford Canada employees has shut nine ofFord's plants in Canada and threatened to hobble operationsat some key Ford plants in the U.S.</TEXT></DOC>
