Mr. Bildt, the 42-year-old leader of Sweden's conservativeModerate Party, heads a minority, four-party coalitiongovernment. The Moderates claimed eight posts in the new22-member cabinet. The Liberal Party and farmer-dominatedCenter Party each claimed four cabinet portfolios. TheChristian Democrats, who won seats in parliament for thefirst time this year, got three posts.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Bildt surprised observers by overcoming internaldifferences among the parties and forging a broadnon-Socialist coalition. But his three-year term promises tobe turbulent. The weak parliamentary base will require a deftpolitical balancing act, holding together the ricketycenter-right coalition while mustering support from otheropposition parties to pass legislation in the Riksdag, orparliament.   That task didn't appear any easier as the new premieroutlined an ambitious program for change in his first policystatement to the Riksdag on Friday.   Foreign policy, Mr. Bildt said, will be dominanted by theprocess of European integration and Sweden's bid for fullmembership in the European Community. The issue of Swedishmembership in the EC enjoys strong bipartisan support. Butsome European political leaders were miffed when the Swedeswarned in their membership application that the EC's movestoward political union would be incompatible with traditionalSwedish neutrality.   Mr. Bildt, widely respected for his foreign policy savvy,struck a new, more positive tone toward the obligations of ECmembership in his Riksdag speech. Sweden, he pledged, &quot;mustparticipate in all aspects of cooperation and accept anychanges which may result from the EC's intergovernmentalconferences now in progress.&quot; And where neutrality isconcerned, Mr. Bildt said in a clear diplomatic signal, &quot;theformulation of Swedish foreign and security policy willchange in a changing Europe.&quot;   Economic policy, however, looms as the main battlefield inMr. Bildt's vision for Sweden's economic renewal. The premierrepeated earlier warnings that the country is headed fordeepening economic problems and soaring unemployment. &quot;Youwon't see a different Sweden tomorrow, but the country willbe different in five years,&quot; he pledged.   With the government's budget for the coming fiscal yearexpected to show a dramatically widening deficit, Mr. Bildtcan't cut taxes as aggressively as he originally planned. Infact, during the early part of the term, room for tax cutswill be created mainly by reductions in public sectorexpenditures. Finance Ministry officials intend to trimannual state outlays by up to 15 billion kronor ($2.48billion), or a full percentage point of gross nationalproduct.   The government will give priority to tax cuts aimed atspurring economic growth. That includes reductions in payrolltaxes currently assessed corporations; a drop in tax onincome from capital to 20% from the present 30%; and adecrease to 40% from 60% in inheritance taxes which hassparked an accelerating exodus of wealthy individuals andseveral major companies from Sweden.   Deregulation is another priority area in economic policy.Mr. Bildt promised to abolish curbs on foreign ownership ofSwedish securities and property, and to liberalize theacquisition of Swedish companies by foreign corporations.   The new government's first legislative proposals willpropose tax relief for small and medium-sized companies. Bythe end of October, the government also plans to abolish theone percentage point turnover tax charged on the purchase orsale of equities on the Stockholm stock exchange. Theturnover tax has driven much of the trading in Swedishequities to international financial centers such as Londonand New York.   Bo Lundgren, the new deputy finance minister responsiblefor tax policy, insisted that Sweden has many similar taxesthat can be scrapped without any net loss in revenue. In thelonger term, Mr. Lundgren vowed to slash Sweden's present 57%ratio of tax revenue to gross national product, the highestin the world. He predicted that the value-added tax, now morethan 23%, would have to be pruned to about 18% by themid-1990s as a consequence of Swedish membership in the EC.   And in a major symbolic gesture, the new government plansto dismantle Sweden's so-called wage earner funds. The SocialDemocratic government's decision to create the system oftax-financed mutual funds in 1984 sparked one of the mostbitter political battles of the past dacade here.   The funds were promoted as a way to staunch runaway payincreases by giving workers an indirect, union-controlledownership stake in Swedish industry. But the scheme had scanteffect on wage moderation. Companies, meanwhile, stronglyopposed the funds as being just a disguised form ofsocialism.</TEXT></DOC>
