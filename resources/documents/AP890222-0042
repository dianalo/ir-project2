The Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which reviewed theactivities of the world's largest futures market from July 1987 toApril 1988, said the board's routine computer surveillance programwas inadequate.   The CFTC called for modifications to the program.   A similar criticism was levied by the agency in its last reviewof the board of trade in 1986, but received little public attention.However, the latest report comes as a federal grand jury in Chicagois reviewing evidence from a two-year FBI undercover investigationof widespread alleged abuses at the board of trade and the ChicagoMercantile Exchange.   In reaction to the FBI investigation, Congress is closelyscrutinizing both the Chicago markets and the commission's oversightof them. The agency's legislative authorization expires Sept. 30 andCongress may demand reforms before passing it.   In response to the report, board of trade officials noted thatthe exchange's directors voted earlier this month to spend $1million this year to improve the exchange's computerized tradereconstruction system, which is designed to catch improper trades.   Officials estimated then that the system was already about 90percent effective in catching abuses. They said the upgrade wouldincrease the system's effectiveness to 100 percent.   They also noted that over the past three years the exchange hasexpanded its investigative office by 75 percent.   ``We are always looking for constructive criticism about our ruleenforcement record from the CFTC,'' Board of Trade President ThomasR. Donovan said in a statement.   The CFTC report took note of the improvements, but said, ``It istoo soon to evaluate the changes.''</TEXT></DOC>
