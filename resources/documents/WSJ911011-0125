But this challengeis perhaps the least troubling of all those now faced by theOAS in Haiti. Policy makers in Washington and throughout thehemisphere are haunted by the questions surrounding theHaitian coup and the fiery priest-turned-president.   Among the questions being asked are the following: How canWashington favor a political leader who advocates brutal,vigilante-style justice against his political enemies? Willpolitical and economic isolation be enough to persuade thecoup leaders to allow President Aristide to return, or willsome military force be needed to change their minds? CanPresident Aristide reconcile the use of an outside militaryforce to reinstate him after a lifetime of stridentanti-imperialist and fiercely nationalistic preachings? Howlong would an OAS force have to stay in Haiti to providesecurity for President Aristide (and who will pay for theoperation)? What will be the fate of the coup-prone Haitianarmy?</LP><TEXT>   Despite the questions, the OAS acted swiftly to call onall member states (including the U.S.) to freeze Haiti'sassets and to impose a trade embargo on the Caribbean-islandnation. While a trade embargo has failed to dislodge FidelCastro from power in Cuba, the result may be different inHaiti. The former Soviet Union and its axis powers had astake in the Communist experiment 90 miles from the U.S. andwere willing to bail it out. But no one is around to supportthe Haitian coup leaders. So it is doubtful that the67-year-old President-appointee Joseph Nerette will withstandsanctions imposed on his government. Nevertheless, Haitianarmy officers I've interviewed say they would rather diefighting than allow President Aristide to return.   Therein lies the crux of the matter. The liberationtheologist Aristide, extremely popular with the masses, hasfrightened the military and the middle and upper classes ofHaitian society by his radical rhetoric. During a recentvisit in New York, he addressed his cheering supporters atthe Cathedral of St. John the Divine, saying: &quot;We wereelected, so we have to follow the rules of the game. But hadwe taken power by revolution, we would have alreadynationalized right and left. . . . We'll have to go slower,but we will get there anyway.&quot;   The president was more explicit when he arrived back inPort-au-Prince on Sept. 27. From the steps of the NationalPalace, he harangued the thousands who had come to welcomehim. Addressing the nation's bourgeoise he warned: &quot;Thatmoney which you have is not really yours. You earned it inthievery . . . under an evil regime and system.&quot; And turningto the poor, he advised: &quot;Whenever you are hungry, turn youreyes in the direction of those who aren't hungry. Wheneveryou are out of work, turn your eyes in the direction of thosewho can put people to work. Ask them, `Why not?'&quot;   Father Aristide also made reference to a popular weaponused by some of his followers, a gasoline-soaked tire thatbecomes a flaming torch when placed around a victim's neck.&quot;What a beautiful tool]&quot; said the president. &quot;What abeautiful instrument] What a beautiful device . . . whereveryou go you want to inhale it.&quot;   Two days after that speech, the military acted. They havesince outlined at least 18 violations of the 1987constitution by President Aristide and his government,including intimidation of the legislature and organizing aprivate militia reminiscent of the Tontons Macout goons ofthe Duvalier period. After some pressure by the Americascommunity, President Aristide belatedly denounced violence,whether by &quot;necklacing&quot; or by military repression.   For their part, the Haitian military is no paragon ofvirtue. The bloody coup apparently has caused hundreds ofdeaths, including many children shot indiscriminately. OnMonday, an OAS mission discussing the possible return ofPresident Aristide with army chief Gen. Raoul Cedras wasapproached by heavily armed soldiers and told to leave thecountry at once. Immediately afterward, the military stormedthe Parliament and urged an immediate vote for a newpresident.   &quot;By no means are we going to let the OAS dictate to uswhat we should do,&quot; said a major I talked with who seemed tobe a key organizer of the coup. He noted that &quot;it's not acoup of the top leadership, but of the whole army, and if he{Father Aristide} comes back, he will be shot dead thistime.&quot;   It's beginning to look more and more as though thereinstatement of President Aristide cannot be realizedwithout superior force. &quot;There may be no way of achieving{reinstatement} without some type of peace-keeping force toneutralize the rampaging soldiers,&quot; Jocelyn McCalla,executive director of the Coalition for Haitian Refugees tolda reporter for the New York City Sun. Mr. McCalla added:&quot;Steel can only be cut by steel. You can't rely on theHaitian army to support the democratic process; they are toocorrupt.&quot;   Military analysts in Washington estimate that at least10,000 troops would be needed to topple Haiti's military andsecure the country while the army is reorganized. But whydoes Haiti need a military? The bulk of the army's dutiescould be absorbed by a decentralized police force, a coastguard and border patrol.   Moreover, the U.S. is not sanguine about a militaryoccupation of Haiti for two reasons: Its last intervention in1915 lasted 19 years and spawned an intellectual movement --The Griots -- which became the underpinning of the Duvalierdictatorships. Also, the U.S. is still taking heat from theOAS for its 1989 invasion of Panama. And if successful, aHaitian invasion might be seen as a precedent for a similarproblem in a country with a population larger than Haiti's6.5 million.   Meanwhile, President Aristide has requested that the OASsend a &quot;civilian mission to establish a presence in Haitiin order to contribute to the solution of the crisis in thecountry.&quot;   The OAS resolved to accede to President Aristide'srequest. But how successful can such a mission be withoutproper security, especially in light of the bullying of OASmembers at the Haitian airport this week? Indeed, an OASstatement noted that any mission &quot;must have the guaranteesthat are indispensible for the security of its members.&quot;Currently, the only people who can guarantee this are themilitary personnel now standing behind their puppetpresident.   ---   Mr. Joseph is co-publisher and editor of the NewYork-based Haiti Observateur.
