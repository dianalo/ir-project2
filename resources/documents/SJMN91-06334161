Now school districts across thestate, already strapped for money, are facing the possibility of giving backpay or additional days off to their patriotic employees so they can have thevictory celebration they are legally entitled to.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Editorial  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  THE NEW PATRIOTISMSCHOOL EMPLOYEES UNION IS EXPLOITING THE GULF WARTO GET A FEW DAYS OFF WORK  </HEADLINE><TEXT>     Back in April, during the giddy days of victory in the Persian Gulf,President Bush urged the American people to celebrate with three &quot;Days ofThanksgiving.&quot; Some showed their patriotism by rejoicing, saying prayers,honking horns, waving flags. Others celebrated by marching in protests againstthe war.;   The CSEA saw the president's invitation as an opportunity to cashin. You see, the California Education Code requires that any time thepresident or governor declares a day for &quot;public fast, thanksgiving orholiday,&quot; the employees get a paid day off.;   So the union successfully suedthe San Leandro Unified School District, demanding three paid holidays for thesecretaries, janitors, bus drivers and others represented by the CSEA.Teachers, who are required by contract to teach a certain number of days eachyear, were not included in the suit.;   There's no doubt the union membershave a legal right to the time off, but the claim is hardly in keeping withthe spirit of Bush's declaration. Why should people who played no part in thegulf war profit from it? Is that what is meant by a peace dividend?;   Nowthat the employees have their victory, we hope they will work out settlementsthat won't hurt the struggling school districts. Many year-round employeesalready have agreed to take their days off when school is not in session.Better yet, why not donate those three days last April to their district, inthe name of the troops who died in the gulf? That would be patriotism.  </TEXT><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   911129  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Friday  </DAY><MONTH>  November  </MONTH><PG.COL>  10B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  347  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Friday, November 29, 199100334161,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
