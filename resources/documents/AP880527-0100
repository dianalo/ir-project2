Frederik van Zyl Slabbert, former head of the ProgressiveFederal Party and an apartheid opponent, met with four ANC nationalexecutive committee members, including information and publicityhead Thabo Mbeki.   The same four met Thursday with an eight-member delegation fromSouth Africa's anti-apartheid National Democratic Movement.   The ANC is the major guerrilla group fighting the white-minoritygovernment in South Africa. Outlawed in South Africa, it is basedin Lusaka, Zambia.   After Thursday's meeting, the two sides said they sharplydisagreed about the use of violence to bring about reforms in theirhomeland.   Slabbert spoke briefly to reporters during a break in hisdiscussions with ANC officials at a Frankfurt hotel.   ``It's an informal discussion on a wide range of topics,''Slabbert said. ``We're just a group of concerned South Africanstalking.''   Slabbert said that in the talks he had not tried to persuade theANC to ``change strategies'' and try to become involved in localand national politics.   The South African government has refused to lift its ban on theANC unless it renounces violence.   Slabbert is director of planning and policy for the Institutefor a Democratic Alternative for South Africa, an anti-apartheidthink tank he helped found. He is widely viewed as his country'smost charismatic white anti-apartheid leader.   Five members from the National Democratic Movement delegationattended today's meeting, said Harald Pakendorf, a member of thedelegation.   Wynand Malan, leader of the delegation and a parliamentarymember, was asked after the Thursday meeting if the twoanti-apartheid groups had discussed the use of violence.   ``We voiced not only our position but our difference over thatstrategy,'' Malan told reporters.   ``We also got an explanation from (the African NationalCongress) again as to the origin of the armed struggle. We canunderstand from their perspective exactly what they are saying, butfrom our position we are still fundamentally in disagreement toit,'' Malan said.   He said he wants to continue talks with the banned group toresolve differences.   In a joint statement, the two groups said: ``Common ground wasfound in relation to the kind of South Africa we would like tosee.''   ``However, there were important differences with respect to someaspects of the strategy through which this could be achieved,'' thestatement continued.   By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregatedsociety in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in nationalaffairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintainseparate districts, schools and health services.</TEXT></DOC>
