The city had assembled two shelters to handle the more than 300aliens who were living in the Bobby Maduro Miami Stadium. They werelated placed in more than 80 apartments across Dade County.   By Thursday, city workers sent off the last people from theshelters and did not plan to reopen them again.   Most of the immigrants placed by the city won't have to pay theirown rent until mid-March, and city officials said they won't beoffered further help.   The assistance drew criticism from black leaders in the wake oflast month's disturbances in Miami's black neighborhoods. Theyclaimed Hispanic immigrants were granted special privileges from thecity, while blacks were relatively ignored and have always been leftto fend for themselves.   Critics of the city's recent decisions say the Nicaraguans areunlikely to be able to become self-sufficient because most won'thave work permits while immigration officials decide whether theywill be permitted to stay.   ``These people have really been thrown to the lions,'' saidVivian Correa, a volunteer at St. Louis Catholic Church, which iscontinuing to provide food for some families.   ``They have no papers, no money,'' Correa said. ``They have noway of getting a job.''   While the immigrant migration continues to Dade County, it hasdiminished in recent weeks. Most new arrivals are being absorbed byfamily and friends, officials said.</TEXT></DOC>
