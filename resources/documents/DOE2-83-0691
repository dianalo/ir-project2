<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-83-0691 </DOCNO><TEXT>A measurement of the {beta} spectrum of tritium implanted into a hyperpuregermanium detector is reported. A distortion is observed 17 keV belowthe end point which is in agreement with an earlier measurement involvinga tritium-implanted Si(Li) detector. The excess of counts observed inthe low-energy region of the tritium spectrum is best described by theemission of a 16.9 +- 0.1 keV neutrino and a mixing probability between0.6 and 1.6% when allowance is made for uncertainty in the effectivescreening potential appropriate for tritium bound within a crystal lattice.</TEXT></DOC>
