Despite their differences, the ministers were near a consensus last night that a new production policy is urgently needed to reduce the surging output of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, and that the agreement must include Iraq, which has remained outside OPEC's quota system since 1986.    &quot;It's fundamental that we have an agreement that doesn't exclude any one country,&quot; Julio Cesar Gil, Venezuela's oil minister, said in an interview.    Hisham Nazer, Saudi Arabia's oil minister, was even more emphatic about Iraq. &quot;Any agreement would have to include all the 13&quot; OPEC member nations, he said. Asked if Saudi Arabia would sign an agreement that doesn't include Iraq, he bluntly replied, &quot;No.&quot;    Last night's opening session ran less than two hours and involved &quot;mere formalities,&quot; according to one delegate. The ministers heard OPEC's own supply and demand forecasts, which suggest that demand for OPEC oil in 1989 will average slightly more than 19 million barrels a day, up from about 18.5 million barrels a day in the current quarter.    The opening of the joint session of the cartel's pricing and strategy committees, which some in OPEC suggested could last through tomorrow, was delayed until 9 p.m. because of the late arrival of Iraq's oil minister. His plane was late and, pleading weariness after the journey, he declined to answer reporters' questions about Iraq's position.    Iraq has said repeatedly, however, that it would re-enter the OPEC production-control system only if it were given a quota equal to the 2.4 million barrels a day of Iran, with whom it has recently begun making peace after an eight-year war.    OPEC sources said yesterday that Iraq has garnered support among other Persian Gulf Arab producers for a quota that would realistically reflect its climbing production, which ranges as high as 2.7 million barrels a day.    &quot;I think Iraq is willing&quot; to participate in the OPEC quota system, said Saudi Arabia's Mr. Nazer. Saudi King Fahd also said in a statement issued yesterday in Riyadh that he believed Iran and Iraq &quot;will be regularized within OPEC.&quot;    Iranian delegates continued to reject such an arrangement. When asked last night if he would consent to giving Iraq an equal production quota, Gholamreza Aghazadeh, Iran's oil minister, tersely replied, &quot;No, I don't accept.&quot; Nevertheless, a former OPEC delegate from Iran asserted: &quot;The Iranians are willing to compromise, despite their objections.&quot;    What's more, the former delegate said, &quot;if Iran doesn't agree, it will be blamed for the failure of this meeting&quot; -- blame that the politically sensitive and revenue-starved Iranians aren't eager to shoulder at this time.    The squabbling between Iran and Iraq and falling oil prices helped fuel rallies in the stock and bond markets.    One other major obstacle to a fresh production approach involves the United Arab Emirates, a chronic quota violator currently producing twice its OPEC allotment of about one million barrels a day. But OPEC sources suggested that rest of OPEC would apply so much political pressure on the UAE that it, too, would have to fall into line -- or at least become more discreet in its cheating.    Although the UAE isn't represented here, its oil minister was chairman of last Sunday's meeting of the Gulf Cooperation Council, which laid much of the groundwork for the gathering that began last night. The Arab producers who comprise the GCC, including Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the emirates, called for strict adherence to OPEC's implied production ceiling of 17.4 million barrels a day, with Iraq included at parity with Iran -- or a higher ceiling for all OPEC members if the 13 nations shared proportionately.    Arab and other OPEC sources have suggested a new production ceiling in the range of 18.5 million to 19 million barrels a day. If strictly observed, that would lead to an actual reduction in OPEC output, which has surged since the summer to nearly 21 million barrels a day, according to Rilwanu Lukman, Nigeria's oil minister and OPEC's president.    Last night, a majority of the oil ministers appeared to be leaning toward the Gulf Cooperation Council's proposal. &quot;The GCC proposal is a good starting point for negotiations,&quot; Venezuela's Mr. Gil said. He called 18.5 million to 19 million barrels a day &quot;a good range&quot; for a new ceiling -- one, he said, that should keep prices at $14 to $16 a barrel, some $3 higher than the current level.    The Venezuelan oil minister noted, however, that whatever the outcome of the talks here, it can't become an official decision of OPEC until all 13 oil ministers have voted on it. He said the current meeting was laying the groundwork &quot;for the agreement we ought to make in November,&quot; when OPEC is scheduled to hold a regular conference in Vienna. </TEXT></DOC>
