CT revealed 188 lesions of pleuralthickening in 44 of 46 patients (96 %) while the routine PA radiographof the chest showed only 27 lesions of pleural thickening in 25 of 46patients (54 %). The pleural thickening of pericardiac and paravertebralareas was revealed on CT, but not on PA chest radiograph. By the shapeand the extension of pleural thickening, the CT findings of these patientswere classified into 4 types (spotty, nodular, plate-like and surrounding),the incidence of which was 32 (17 %), 36 (19 %), 100 (53 %) and 20 (11%) of 188 lesions respectively. Pleural thickening was distributed mostlyin the posterior wall of the middle and lower lung. By the duration ofasbestos exposure, patients were divided into 3 groups (Group A: 14 to25 years, Group B: 26 to 34 years and Group C: 35 to 43 years); pleualthickening was detected in 16 patients (89 %), 14 patients (100 %) and14 patients (100 %) respectively. The mean number of lesions in GroupC was greater than that in Groups A and B. Plate-like type was detectedin the highest incidence in all Groups, 40 of 65 lesions (62 %) in GroupA, 20 of 49 lesions (41 %) in Group B, and 40 of 74 lesions (54 %) inGroup C. It could be considered that CT is very useful in the detectionof initial pleural change, analysis of the distribution of pleural thickeningand the staging of pulmonary asbestosis.</TEXT></DOC>
