Gagliardi, Gary.andM;</AUTHOR><DESCRIPT/><TEXT>TRAIN AND TRAIN ALIKEandM;To the Editor:andM;Diane Danielle's &quot;LAN Lines&quot; column and Cheryl Currid's &quot;Risky Business&quot;column in the July 24 issue address a far-reaching problem: training.andM;&quot;A few hours of training&quot; may be adequate for those people already familiarwith PCs, but for many who have never laid hands on one, it quickly becomes ashort course in mass confusion.andM;The plethora of unfamiliar keys is mind-boggling.andP;  Common words like &quot;menu,&quot;&quot;window&quot; and &quot;mouse&quot; suddenly take on new meanings to people who hold collegedegrees and have been working for years.andP;  Now they're back in first grade.andO;The commands that appear on the screen might as well be hieroglyphics.andP;  Theteacher has so much material to cover that he's into subdirectories beforehis students have been able to figure out the difference between a C driveand an A drive.andM;The problem requires give-and-take on both sides.andP;  Management has to realizethat while minimal training may be enough for some employees, it may takeweeks before some others will really master the programs, and they needconstant help along the way.andP;  Expecting their employees to meet a deadlineusing a program when they are just learning is an exercise in futility forall.andM;One solution would be to start a procedure that's relevant to a particularjob assignment and be given the opportunity to learn each functionthoroughly.andP;  Get them comfortable with one program at a time.andM;When many people do the same type of input, specific guidelines can bewritten in elementary language for each step.andP;  Forget the so-calleduser-friendly manuals that read like they were written at M.I.T.andP;  Have readyaccess to someone who understands both the job and the particular computerprogram, as in Currid's help desk.andM;Employees must carry their share of the load also.andP;  Those who disdain anydeviation in their routine must overcome resistance to change and demonstratea willingness to learn.andM;When the teaching process is handled with patience and understanding,everyone benefits.andM;June MoffettandM;Santa Ana, Calif.andM;AN ACCOUNTING OF SOFTWAREandM;To the Editor:andM;The story headlined &quot;High Hopes for High-End Accounting Packages&quot; in the July24 issue is aptly titled.andP;  As a manufacturer of an accounting product thatuses the new 4GL, SQL and CASE technology, I found your article veryinteresting.andP;  Read between the lines, and this is a great story about thestate of accounting software.andM;First, I find it understandable that, in a poll of corporate satisfaction,the vast majority of users failed to respond.andP;  Twenty-five packages wereoriginally considered for the poll, but only three qualified.andP;  Twenty-twoaccounting packages failed to elicit enough qualifying responses from theircorporate customers.andM;What does this tell you about their satisfaction level?andP;  This conforms verywell with an earlier poll by a competing publication showing thatdissatisfaction with accounting software was four or five times higher thanthat of any other software package.andM;More interesting was the poll itself and the criteria upon which theremaining three packages were scored.andM;High on the list of important attributes is low data corruption andrestoration of corrupted data.andM;Since when is frequency of data corruption an attribute of an accountingpackage?andP;  The fact that this is such a major concern tells us a lot about thedata integrity on non-SQL-based accounting technology.andM;Those who sell SQL accounting software would never have thought of this as afeature because data integrity is built into the database at such a low levelthat corruption is virtually impossible.andP;  For accounting users, there is onlyone acceptable level of corruptibility: zero.andM;The feature that received the lowest rating from users was &quot;inability tocustomize product.&quot; Considering that it's virtually impossible to modifythese third-generation products, this low rating is not that surprising.andM;More interesting was that modifiability also received one of the lowestratings in importance.andP;  Since end users continuously complain about the lackof specific features, I can only assume that they were not able to relate theattribute of modifiability to this constant problem.andM;All of the new areas of software development -- SQL, 4GL and CASE programming-- are designed to make software more modifiable.andP;  Considering the number of$100 million software companies that are being built selling this technology,I suspect that there may well be more interest in it than your articleindicated.andM;Gary GagliardiandM;President, Fourgen SoftwareandM;Edmonds, Wash.andM;----------The editors of PC Week invite readers to air their opinions on the editorialpage.andP;
