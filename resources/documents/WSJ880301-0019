In a typical comment, Edward E. Crutchfield Jr., chairman and chief executive officer of First Union Corp., a rapidly growing banking concern based in Charlotte, N.C., said in an interview:   &quot;In my mind, the costs are so great in terms of time, diversion of energy and ill will generated that it has zero appeal to us. In fact, I think I'd rather see our company sold than get into one.&quot;    Although hostile takeovers of small banks have occurred in the past, the tactic is in the spotlight again because of last week's actions by the Federal Reserve Board and New York state approving the biggest proposed hostile banking takeover yet -- Bank of New York Co.'s $1.08 billion bid for Irving Bank Corp., New York.    If Bank of New York wins a proxy fight and the merger is approved by shareholders, it would create the nation's 12th largest banking concern, with about $42 billion in assets.    Lawrence Cohn, a securities analyst with Merrill Lynch andamp; Co., said, &quot;The issue in unfriendly offers for banks isn't whether regulators will allow it, but whether there are managements out there willing to wage them.&quot; He called Carter Bacot, Bank of New York's chairman, &quot;relatively unique&quot; for his willingness both to undertake a hostile takeover and to make the necessary cuts to &quot;realize the efficiencies&quot; after a merger.    H. Rodgin Cohen, an attorney with Sullivan andamp; Cromwell and a Bank of New York adviser, said last week's regulatory actions remove some doubts about the feasibility of hostile takeovers. But he says: &quot;Of our major clients, no one has picked up the phone and said to me, 'Let's do it.' And I don't think I will get any calls like that.&quot;    Nevertheless, E.D. Herlihy, an attorney with Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen andamp; Katz and an Irving adviser, sent a memo to his clients Friday that concluded: &quot;While the Irving Bank order will be appealed, it appears that the last remaining regulatory doubt has now been resolved. The era of hostile bank takeovers has arrived.&quot;    Fed approval, however, doesn't seem to have whetted the appetites of bankers who have had merger offers rebuffed. R. Crosby Kemper, chairman of United Missouri Bancshares Inc. in Kansas City, said he has no interest in mounting a hostile offer for Centerre Bancorp., a larger concern based in St. Louis.    Clarence C. Barksdale, president and chief executive officer of Centerre, recently rejected an unsolicited $260 million offer from United Missouri. Securities analysts said the offer was 25% below Centerre's book value.    &quot;I don't think unfriendly mergers are too good a thing,&quot; Mr. Kemper said. &quot;There are too many opportunities where you don't have to be unfriendly.&quot;    However, Victor J. Riley Jr., chairman of Albany, N.Y.-based KeyCorp, said he would consider making a hostile bid for another bank under certain circumstances. &quot;I applaud the Fed's move. It opens a door that was only partially open before,&quot; he said.    A hostile offer, he said, can work in large cities where there are many banks. But the tactic, Mr. Riley said, would create bad feelings in smaller cities. In such cases, he said, &quot;You're not going to have any business if you're successful.&quot;    Charles J. Thayer, senior vice president and treasurer of Pittsburgh-based PNC Financial Corp., said: &quot;Putting two banks together is a pretty complicated task. In a hostile situation, it's difficult to create value for the shareholder. I really don't think that hostile offers will become widespread.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
