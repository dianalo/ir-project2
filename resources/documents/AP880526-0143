The broadcasting industry branded some provisions of thelegislation unconstitutional.   The media blitz would have the ``intensity of a presidentialadvertising campaign,'' said Sen. John Danforth of Missouri,ranking Republican on the panel, who introduced the bill with Sen.Ernest Hollings, D-S.C., committee chairman.   ``When people turn on their TV in the evening, we want them tosee at least once during the evening a commercial that is veryhard-hitting about the drug issue,'' Danforth said at a newsconference.   Under the measure, the National Telecommunications andInformation Administration in the Commerce Department would overseeproduction of the ads and buy time to air them on commercial radioand TV stations nationwide.   The bill would authorize $75 million a year over three years forthe program. Broadcasters would be required to provide thegovernment reasonable access to all time periods to air the spotsand to charge their lowest rates.   The National Association of Broadcasters said the bill isunconstitutional because it mandates government access to broadcastfacilities.   Broadcasters support anti-drug efforts and already contributemore than $1 billion a year in air time and facilities to theanti-drug campaign, said NAB President Edward O. Fritts.   Hollings cited precedents for the federal government advertisingon radio and TV, including the armed forces' recruiting ads andpromotions for Amtrak. But the NAB said that in none of those casesis a broadcast station required by law to accept an ad.   Danforth said an anti-drug ad campaign should be at least assuccessful as anti-smoking campaigns, which have had to competeagainst counter-advertising by the tobacco industry and reliedmostly on public service announcements.   Despite the obstacles, anti-smoking campaigns produced a 25percent decline in cigarette smoking among Americans over the pasttwo decades, he said.</TEXT></DOC>
