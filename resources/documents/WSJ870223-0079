Levine, who engaged in massive insider trading but helped the government expose the largest scandal in Wall Street history, was sentenced to two years in prison and fined $362,000.    Lawyers and investment bankers said the sentence was surprisingly lenient, given Mr. Levine's breaches of client trust and his efforts to conceal his crimes, including perjury in testimony before the Securities and Exchange Commission. They suggested that the sentence was meant to encourage any other wrongdoers to cooperate in the government's broadening investigation.    Mr. Levine, an investment banker and takeover specialist at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. at the time of his arrest last May, pleaded guilty to four felony counts and could have been sentenced to as much as 20 years in prison.    U.S. District Judge Gerard L. Goettel said that if Mr. Levine's cooperation hadn't proved so &quot;truly extraordinary,&quot; leading to the capture of, among others, takeover speculator Ivan F. Boesky, he would have sentenced Mr. Levine to five to 10 years in prison. The judge noted that with Mr. Levine's help, the government had &quot;uncovered an entire nest of vipers on Wall Street.&quot;    Mr. Levine also had been accused by the SEC last May of making $12.6 million in illegal profits by trading in a total of 54 takeover-related stocks between 1981 and 1985. During that period, he worked at a total of four securities firms.    In settling those charges last June, he agreed to pay the government $11.6 million, and agreed to pay $2 million in unpaid taxes. There still is a dispute between Mr. Levine and the government over whether the $2 million settlement should be part of the $11.6 million settlement, or in addition to it.    In comments from the bench, Judge Goettel acknowledged recent criticism by Rudolph Giuliani, U.S. attorney for New York's southern district, who has charged that lenient sentences are being meted out to persons convicted of insider trading. &quot;There has been a lot of public criticism of the sentences' being too light,&quot; the judge said. But he noted that government prosecutors emphasized Mr. Levine's cooperation in their sentencing memo, adding that if &quot;you don't reward cooperation, you don't get it.&quot;    Mr. Guiliani, in a telephone interview, said the two-year prison sentence was &quot;entirely appropriate,&quot; given Mr. Levine's &quot;very substantial cooperation&quot; with the government. He said that &quot;it was quite helpful that the judge indicated the range of sentence that he would have imposed had Mr. Levine not cooperated.&quot;    In an appearance yesterday on the CBS News program &quot;Face the Nation,&quot; Mr. Giuliani said that judges are meting out increasingly harsh sentences against those who don't cooperate. But he said it will take prison terms ranging from four years to nine years to deter insider trading.    Mr. Giuliani said the government will have to bring many more cases over the next six to 12 months to &quot;change the ethics&quot; underlying the &quot;very extensive practice&quot; of insider trading.    At the sentencing, Mr. Levine was besieged by media attention usually reserved for celebrities. The small federal courthouse in suburban White Plains, N.Y., -- where Judge Goettel, who accepted Mr. Levine's guilty pleas last June, was sitting last week -- was surrounded by reporters and television camera crews. When Mr. Levine arrived with his wife in a rented limousine, the crush of onlookers was dispersed by police so the Levines could emerge. The courtroom was packed with a crowd that spilled into the hallway.    Mr. Levine, conservatively dressed in a gray suit, white shirt and red tie, showed no emotion as he delivered a statement to the court, saying in flat tones that he has been sentenced to &quot;a life of disgrace and humiliation. . . . I abused the system I believe in, and I will never forgive myself,&quot; he said.    Arthur Liman, Mr. Levine's principal lawyer, tried to portray his client as financially and personally ruined by the scandal. &quot;Every penny he's ever earned is encumbered,&quot; Mr. Liman told the court. He said Mr. Levine is suffering &quot;a form of banishment. He is an outcast, a leper&quot; shunned by all his former friends and associates.    But Judge Goettel, in passing sentence, mentioned no factor that had influenced him in Mr. Levine's favor other than his cooperation in the government's investigation.    Mr. Levine is the sixth person caught up in the scandal to be sentenced. Three others who played smaller roles and were recruited into the scheme by Mr. Levine -- Robert M. Wilkis, Ira Sokolow and Ilan Reich -- received terms of one year and a day. David Brown, a former investment banker recruited by Mr. Sokolow, was sentenced to 30 days in prison, and Randall Cecola, a former analyst, was placed on probation.    While their involvement was less than Mr. Levine's, none was able to implicate anyone with the stature of Mr. Boesky, as Mr. Levine did. Mr. Boesky's cooperation, in turn, led to the recent guilty pleas by former Kidder Peabody andamp; Co. investment banker Martin Siegel and the arrests of three top Wall Street professionals, including the heads of arbitrage at Kidder Peabody and Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co.    The government noted that Mr. Levine made &quot;monitored phone calls,&quot; or taped conversations, even after the publicity surrounding his arrest made the calls more difficult. The government said in its sentencing memo that Mr. Levine's cooperation &quot;is a significant mitigating factor that the court should give great weight to in imposing its sentence.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
