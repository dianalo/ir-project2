But a liquidation in 1986, before the Tax Reform Act took effect, could have been more lucrative than Forstmann Little's bid.    Details of a hypothetical liquidation of the Santa Monica, Calif.-based aerospace and industrial company, which figured in one of the year's most turbulent takeover sagas, are contained in documents about the leveraged buyout filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The documents provide a rare concrete example of the dramatic impact the changing tax law will have on the mergers and acquisitions business.    Lear Siegler's investment bankers, Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., estimated that the proceeds of a 1987 liquidation of Lear Siegler would be $74 a share. Other, unspecified liabilities could have brought the proceeds from a 1987 liquidation down to $65 a share.    But if Lear Siegler had liquidated in time to treat the transaction under 1986 tax law, the proceeds would have been $99 a share, Drexel estimated. The documents filed with the SEC state that by Dec. 16, when Forstmann Little first proposed its $2.1 billion bid to Lear Siegler, any liquidation would have been taxed according to the 1987 laws.    Merger specialists say the prices offered in takeovers and other corporate restructurings may drop in 1987 because the new tax law makes such transactions more expensive to undertake. In particular, the new law's repeal of the so-called general utilities rule deprives acquiring companies of a powerful money-saving practice: marking up the price of assets they buy and then depreciating them based on the higher price.    Drexel also outlined several scenarios for recapitalizing Lear Siegler. The SEC filing mentions two recapitalization plans: One would have yielded about $90 to $94 a share, and a less-leveraged plan would have yielded about $83 to $89 a share.    Forstmann Little began a tender offer for all Lear Siegler common and preferred stock Dec. 23. The offer expires at 12:01 a.m. EST Jan. 23. In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange Friday, Lear Siegler closed at $90.75, up 12.5 cents.    In a leveraged buyout, a small group of investors acquires a company largely with debt that is paid back using the company's cash flow or proceeds from asset sales. According to the SEC filing, Forstmann Little, a closely held New York investment partnership, will invest $800 million of its own money in the buyout and borrow $1.35 billion from a group of banks led by Manufacturers Hanover Trust. The total will be used to pay for the transaction and related fees.    Lear Siegler's and Forstmann's investment banks will receive huge fees for their work on the leveraged buyout. If the buyout goes through, Lear Siegler will pay Drexel about $16.3 million in fees, and Forstmann Little will pay Morgan Stanley andamp; Co. $10 million in fees. Lear Siegler will also pay Goldman Sachs andamp; Co. $4 million for investment banking advice given over the past month.    Forstmann Little said in the filing that Norman Barkeley, Lear Siegler chief executive officer, probably will be an equity investor in the leveraged buyout, and that other Lear Siegler managers may also be equity investors. Forstmann Little said it expects Mr. Barkeley to remain as president of Lear Siegler, though it didn't say whether he will also retain the title of chairman. </TEXT></DOC>
