An official of the Securities and Exchange Commission said itwas the second largest insider trading case the agency has handled.   The SEC filed a civil complaint against Stephen Wang Jr. of NewYork City, an analyst in Morgan Stanley's mergers and acquisitionsdepartment. Also named in the complaint was Fred. C. Lee, a HongKong businessman who allegedly traded on the information suppliedby Wang.   The complaint, filed in federal court in New York, asked for thereturn of $19 million in alleged trading profits plus triple thatamount in damages.   Gary Lynch, the SEC's enforcement chief, said the case issurpassed only by the insider trading case involving Ivan Boesky,who agreed to return $100 million in profits to settle chargesbrought by the SEC in November 1986.   The SEC complaint said Wang was able to obtain information oncompany takeovers being handled by Morgan Stanley. The complaintsaid he provided this information to Lee, who then bought stockbefore the public announcement of various takeovers drove up theprice of that stock.   The SEC said Lee realized more than $19 million in profits whenthe prices of the various securities increased after publicannouncements   The complaint said Lee had transferred to Wang ``at least$200,000.''   Wang had been with Morgan Stanley for two years and had been inthe mergers and acquisition division for one year, Lynch said in aninterview.   Morgan Stanley said in a brief statement that it had suspendedWang pending an investigation. A source at Morgan Stanley who spokeon condition of anonymity said the firm had been cooperating withSEC officials for some time in connection with Wang's activities.   Wang was a junior analyst on a two-year training program forcollege graduates, the source said. He was only a few days awayfrom the July 1 completion of the program when the SEC announcedits action against him.   Investigators alleged in the complaint that Lee, 38, hadattempted to move money out of the United States and for thatreason funds in bank accounts should be frozen. Lee was describedas an international businessman with interest in real estate,import-export operations and public utilities. A citizen of Taiwan,Lee was said to also have a home in McLean, Va., an exclusiveWashington suburb.   Lynch said investigators are alleging that the trading on insideinformation began in July 1987 and involved stock in about 25different companies, including E.F. Hutton, Stop andamp; Shop Cos., UtahPower andamp; Light Co. and Impact Systems.   ``From at least July 1987 through at least April 1988, Leeplaced long-distance telephone calls from McLean, Va., Hong Kongand elsewhere to Wang at his home and office in New York,'' thecomplaint said. ``During these telephone calls, Wang improperlydisclosed to Lee the material, non-public information.''   The complaint said Lee made $3 million in profits by trading thestock of Stop and Shop; $1.2 million in profits on the stock of E.F.Hutton; and $840,000 in profits on Utah Power.   The SEC said other companies whose stocks were traded by Leebased on information obtained from Wang were American StandardInc.; American Brands Inc.; Catalyst Energy Corp.; Chi-Chi's Inc.;Dayton Hudson Corp.; the Dime Savings Bank of New York; E-IIHoldings Inc.; Federated Department Stores; Firestone Tire andRubber; Gillete Co.; IC Industries Inc.; Kerr McGee Corp.;Lymphomed Inc.; Manpower Inc.; Outboard Marine Corp.; Richmond HillSavings Bank; Sabine Corp.; Safecard Services Inc.; SavannahElectric andamp; Power Co.; Staley Continental Inc.; and Stanadyne Inc.   The complaint said Lee had at first denied even knowing Wangduring interviews with an SEC attorney in Hong Kong last Thursdayand Friday. However, the SEC said he decided to change histestimony midway through the second day of questioning and admit tousing information supplied by Wang to profit from stocks, accordingto court documents supplied by the SEC.</TEXT></DOC>
