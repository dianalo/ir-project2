Association President Robert MacCrate said in identical lettersto Republican George Bush and Democrat Michael Dukakis that toooften in the past, presidents have selected ``political friends''to head the Justice Department.   ``The care and importance given to the selection of justices ofthe Supreme Court should be given as well to the selection ofattorney general,'' he said.   Addressing a news conference in Toronto, where the barassociation is holding its annual meeting, MacCrate said hismessage was prompted by the events of the past 18 months,culminating in Meese's resignation under a cloud. Meese, a friendof Reagan, was the subject of a 14-month ethics investigation by anindependent counsel, James McKay. McKay decided against filingcharges but said Meese probably violated conflict-of-interest lawsand willfully filed a false tax return.   The Reagan administration has nominated former Gov. RichardThornburgh of Pennsylvania to replace Meese until the end of theterm.   MacCrate said Meese was one of many top law officers appointedthrough personal connections. He cited Robert Kennedy, attorneygeneral for his brother John F. Kennedy.   ``A close connection between partisan politics and the office ofattorney general inevitably reduces the effectiveness of thedepartment, incites fear about the integrity of the administrationof justice and undermines public confidence in the rule of law,''said MacCrate, a New York attorney.   MacCrate acknowledged that the attorney general is in many ways``the president's lawyer,'' and it's natural that he would choose atrusted friend.   He also said the 346,000-member ABA could do more to help ensurethe candidate is qualified.   Although an ABA standing committee scrutinizes all candidatesfor the federal courts, it does not review nominees for attorneygeneral or other Cabinet posts. ``We should have a machinery to doit,'' he said.   U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar will address theopening assembly of the weeklong annual meeting on Monday. Otherspeakers will include CIA Director William H. Webster and formerSupreme Court Justice Lewis F. Powell. About 12,000 U.S. andCanadian lawyers are expected to attend.</TEXT></DOC>
