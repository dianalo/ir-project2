Arden Haynes, chairman and chief executive officer of theoil and gas concern, attributed the expected loss to weakcommodity prices and intensive competition in Imperial's oilrefining and marketing businesses. Imperial, he commented ina statement, is having &quot;an absolutely devastating year interms of profit.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   &quot;The outlook for this company has never been worse,&quot; saidDenis Mote, an industry analyst with Maison PlacementsCanada, a Montreal investment firm. &quot;Things are pretty badthroughout the operations.&quot;   Imperial officials wouldn't discuss the size of theexpected loss. The company, which is 70% owned by ExxonCorp., reported its first quarterly loss ever for the secondquarter of 1991 and an operating loss for the year would bethe company's first recorded annual loss in its 111 yearhistory. In 1990, Imperial reported net income of 493 millionCanadian dollars (US$432.3 million) or C$2.58 a share, and inthe nine months ended Sept. 30 had net income of C$128million or 66 Canadian cents a share.   Mr. Mote said he expects Imperial to report a net loss ofabout 20 Canadian cents a share for the year.   Imperial has been hit by the same factors that areaffecting the peformance of rivals Shell Canada Ltd., 78%owned by Royal Dutch/Shell Group, and Petro-Canada. All facerecord low natural gas prices upstream, and intensive andgrowing competition from discount gasoline retailers in theirdownstream operations. Petro-Canada has reported a string oflosses, culminating in a loss of C$234 million for the ninemonths, while Shell Canada has said it also expects a lossfor the year following a dismal first-half performance.   In trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange yesterday, sharesof Petro-Canada fell to C$9.13, off 13 Canadian cents. Sharesof Shell Canada fell 38 Canadian cents to close at C$38 ashare.   While Shell Canada can look forward to bringing itsmassive natural gas discovery at Caroline, Alberta, onstreamin the next year to boost cash flow and earnings, Imperialhas no such major projects in view.   &quot;Their conventional oil production is dropping off, theycan't expand their Cold Lake {heavy oil production facility}because prices are still too low and refining is the pits,&quot;Mr. Mote said. That, he says, will result in lower cash flowand earnings for several years.   Imperial says it plans to freeze salaries for all butoperational employees this year as a result of the industrydownturn, and will eliminate executive bonuses. The negativeindustry trends, Mr. Haynes said in his release, &quot;are causingus to re-examine the fundamentals of our business and toprepare plans to respond accordingly.&quot;   A spokesman for Imperial declined to elaborate on Mr.Haynes's comments, but said the company already has begun aninternal review of its operations, which he said wouldn't bediscussed until conclusions were reached on a strategy topursue.</TEXT></DOC>
