 As Microsoft and Apple temporarily forget thelong-running look-and-feel lawsuit to cement details of their new fonttechnology exchange, it's Adobe Systems which looks as if it will soon be inneed of medical assistance.andM;What Microsoft has done is to license Apple's Royal outline-font technology,due to be built into the forthcoming System 7.0 operating system upgrade forthe Macintosh, with the intention of using in Presentation Manager.andP;  Apple,in return, has licensed Microsoft's clone of Adobe's PostScript pagedescription language, which Microsoft bought in from Bauer Enterprisesearlier this year.andM;This means that both Macintoshes and PCs running Presentation Manager will,in the end, use identical fonts to generate their screen images.andP;  They willalso use the same page description language to translate these fonts fromscreen to paper, along with any graphics produced by Apple's QuickDraw orMicrosoft's Graphic Programming Interface (GPI) technology.andM;Which is where Adobe comes in -- or, rather, where Adobe may be kicked out.andO;This is because system independence, as well as its device independence, hasalways been a big selling point for PostScript.andM;PostScript files can be sent across networks of PCs, Macintoshes and Unixsystems, and drive shared laser printers or typesetting machines with a widevariety of print resolutions.andP;  These files can be produced by any major PC orMacintosh application and readily exchanged between them.andM;If Adobe had succeeded in the attempt to get its Display PostScript adoptedas the standard for screen imaging, just as PostScript is the standard forprinted page imaging, then there would have been a true unified imagingtechnology that would allow PostScript files to be exchanged between any twomachines and imaged on any size of screen or printed on any type of printer.andM;But although Display PostScript has only been picked up by IBM, DEC, NeXT andsort of implemented by Sun Microsystems, and was a long way from being anindustry standard, Adobe was still in the game.andP;  As long as there was nocompeting standard imaging technology that could work across multiplehardware platforms, Adobe and its president, John Warnock, could regard theseparate moves of Apple and Microsoft towards unified screen and paperimaging for the Macintosh and Presentation Manager with some equanimity.andM;Adobe could convert its carefully-guarded font outlines into Royal format forthe Macintosh, for example, and it was already working on the Adobe TypeManager package that would produce scaleable Macintosh screen fonts from thecontents of the Adobe Type Library.andP;  Give users Adobe screen fonts to go withtheir PostScript printer and the system independence of PostScript would keepthem away from converting wholesale to Royal for printing.andM;Adobe could also do the same in the PC market, producing a version of TypeManager for Presentation Manager, and converting its Type Library intowhatever outline font format Microsoft and IBM chose for the screens andprinters of Presentation Manager systems.andP;  Warnock must have viewed with acertain amount of satisfaction the debates between Microsoft, IBM andHewlett-Packard over which font technology to use.andP;  Hewlett-Packard, by farthe market leader in PC laser and other page printers, was pressing forAgfa-Compugraphics's Intellifont.andM;HP already uses this technology in its DeskWriter ink-jet printer for theMacintosh and will be using it in the LaserJet III; it would be very handyindeed if Presentation Manager fonts were compatible.andP;  But IBM didn't likethe idea of giving HP, a major competitor in the printer market, an edge likethat and favoured the Intelligent Font Interface (IFI).andP;  This would let usersmix and match fonts from a variety of suppliers, but would give them the samecompatibility problems of matching fonts to printers that they have now.andM;Microsoft, in its turn, didn't like IFI, but was in favour of an open fontstandard that would let any font vendor produce Presentation Manager fontsfor screens and printers.andP;  Adobe fonts were out, because of the encryptionthat Adobe users to protect its designs.andP;  The standards from single fontmanufacturers such as Agfa-Compugraphic and Bitstream, with its Speedotechnology, were a trifle too proprietary.andM;Enter Apple with a need for a PostScript clone of its own, and a new outlinefont technology that's fully open and has support from every major fontfoundry.andP;  Enter the Apple-Microsoft cross-licensing deal.andP;  This must havecome as a shock to Adobe.andP;  Instead of sitting on the sidelines and picking upbusiness from being the only imaging standard that worked across theMacintosh-PC boundary, it looked liek losing the whole thing.andP;  If Apple andMicrosoft could produce an open, unified screen-and-paper imaging standardfor multiple hardware platforms, and could garner support from enough fontfoundries and typesetter makers, then PostScript would be in deep trouble.andM;At the Seybold Desktop Publishing Conference in San Francisco, where theMicrosoft/Apple deal was publicly announced, Warnock reacted angrily.andO;According to the Newsbytes newsletter in the US, Warnock described what thetwo companies had done as &quot;the biggest bunch of garbage and mumbo-jumbo I'veever heard in my life.&quot;andP;  But he also announced that PostScript would beplaced fully in the public domain (see News, this issue), and that Adobewould open its font technology for scrutiny and manipulation by third parties-- something which had always previously been held out as a tantalizer withan unspecified date attached.andM;The great unknown factor now is IBM, which uses PostScript, has a license forDisplay PostScript and can be expected not to be overjoyed at the prospect ofbuilding Apple technology into its own system software.andM;But in a world where IBM page printers have AppleTalk connectors, anythingcan happen.andP;  Warnock and Adobe's other founder, Chuck Geschke, having beenheralded for so long as the creators of the technology that made desktoppublishing possible and made Apple so much cash in its turn, must also bethinking along these lines.andP;  Anything can happen, and PostScript could easilydwindle from being the industry standard to a simple PS attached to the longhistory of printing.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
