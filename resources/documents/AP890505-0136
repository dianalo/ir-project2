The blow came as Mrs. Thatcher marked her 10th anniversary inpower and declared she has transformed Britain.   The socialist Labor Party claimed its stunning victory in theWelsh Vale of Glamorgan shows voters are particularly wary of Mrs.Thatcher's latest free-market crusade _ to overhaul the freeNational Health Service that is a cornerstone of Britain's welfarestate.   ``Mrs. Thatcher's days are numbered,'' declared John Smith, whooverturned the Conservatives' 6,251-vote majority to win by 6,028votes.   Smith swept through the largely rural district's main town, theport of Barry, in an open-top bus thronged by cheering supportesrcelebrating the huge 12{ percent swing against the government.   Mrs. Thatcher's Energy Secretary Cecil Parkinson said Labor'swin is a ``warning to the government it is not as popular as itwould like to be.''   ``But it is not in any way depressing or intimidating,''Parkinson added.   Defeated Conservative candidate Rod Richards acknowledged voterhostility to the health service program and other reforms Mrs.Thatcher is pursuing in her third term. They include a new propertytax and selling off the national water and electricity utilities.   ``We have to win that debate in the country and it will taketime because we are changing things quite radically,'' Richardssaid.   Labor also was boosted by the collapse of support for Britain'ssquabbling center parties, which split after the 1987 generalelection and adopted rivalries now ridiculed as ``the muddle in themiddle.''   Labor polled 23,342 votes to the Tories' 17,314. The centristSocial and Liberal Democratic Party took only 2,017 and the SocialDemocractic Party, its previous electoral ally, got 1,098. TheWelsh nationalist party Plaid Cymru also did badly with 1,672 votes.   The Vale of Glamorgan, where the previous legislator died thisyear, was only the fourth district in 25 years that Labor hassnatched from the Conservatives in a by-election.   Polling was Thursday, the 10th anniversary of Mrs. Thatcher'saccession to the premiership. Now in her third five-year term, shemust call the next election by mid-1992.   Until then, she still commands a huge majority of 101 seats inthe 650-member House of Commons. Conservatives have 375 seats,Labor 228, the Social and Liberal Democrats 19 and the SocialDemocratic Party 3. Minority regional parties hold the rest.   Earlier, the Conservatives and Laborites did well in countycouncil elections in England and Wales, making substantial gains atthe expense of the center parties.   Tory and Labor leaders said that British politics is back in thetraditional two-party mold, which was upset by the formation of aburgeoning centrist alliance in 1981.   In 1983 and 1987 general elections, the centrists took nearlyone-fourth of the vote, although they won few seats and oftenhelped a Conservative to victory by splitting the anti-Thatchervote.   In Thursday's elections for 47 county councils, theConservatives finished with overall control of 19, up from 12, andLabor with 13, up from nine.   The Social and Liberal Democrats kept control of their solecounty council, the Isle of Wight, but lost seats across thecountry. Independents had control of two county councils and noparty had overall control in the other 12.   Adding to Mrs. Thatcher's problems is a resurgence in inflation,now at 7.9 percent and among the highest in industrializedcountries, and a hefty balance of payments deficit that topped $2.8billion in March.   In addition, labor unions are flexing their muscles after yearsof defeats.   Railmen, dockers, engineers, firefighters, electricians, Londonsubway drivers and BBC journalists and production staff all arethreatening strikes.   Some Conservative claim the unrest may be organized. ``This isbeginning to look like a conspiracy,'' said Tory legislator HarryGreenway.   Nevertheless, the Conservative Party remains ahead in nationalopinion polls _ three points ahead of Labor with 42-percent supportmatching that of 1987.</TEXT></DOC>
