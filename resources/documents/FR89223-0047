Based on this review, BPA has determined that currenttransmission rates will continue to produce sufficient revenue for BPAto meet its statutory requirements for Fiscal Years (FY) 1990 and 1991.Therefore, BPA is proposing to extend its 1987 rates by readopting its1987 Rate Schedules as its 1989 transmission rate schedules to be effectivethrough FY 1990 and 1991.Through a separate public involvement process, BPA has completed a throughreview of program cost levels for the budgets for FY 1990 and 1991. TheAdministrator will not reexamine program level decisions in the rate case.Beginning in October 1988, BPA conducted a series of workships on subjectsrelevant to BPA's ratesetting. The purpose of the workship was to identify,simplify, and reduce the number of issues that might become part of 1989rate case. All parties to the 1987 rate case were informed of and invitedto the workshops. The workshops were well attended and provided opportunitiesfor informal public comment on issues outside the formal hearing process.Opportunities will be available for interested persons to review BPA'sproposal to readopt the 1987 rates based on the existing supporting studies,to participate in the rate hearing, and to submit written comments. Duringthe development of the final rate proposal, BPA will evaluate all writtenand oral comments received in this process. Consideration of comments andmore current data may result in the final rate proposal differing fromthe rates proposed in this notice.<T3>Responsible Official: </T3>Ms. Shirley R.

Introduction</ITAG>On December 23, 1988, in order to satisfy contractual provisions betweenBPA and its customers, BPA published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>a notice of ``Intent to Revise Transmission Ratesto Become Effective October 1, 1989,'' 53 FR 51891. Since then, BPA hascontinued to study the adequacy of its current rates and has concludedthat current 1987 rates will be adequate for the 1989 rate period.In order to assess its current rates, BPA first determined the amount ofrevenue required to meet its financial obligations in FY 1990 and 1991.BPA has determined that the revenues BPA would expect to collect from projectedloads under its current rates will adequately cover these revenue requirements.Therefore, BPA proposes to readopt and refile the current 1987 transmissionrates as the proposed 1989 transmission rates. BPA files its rates withthe Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC).The proposed transmission rates were prepared in accordance with BPA'sstatutory authority to develop rates, including the Bonneville ProjectAct of 1937, as amended, 16 U.S.C. 832 e, f (1982); the Flood Control Actof 1944, 16 U.S.C. 825s (1982); the Regional Preference Act, 16 U.S.C.837 (1982); the Federal Columbia River Transmission System Act, 16 U.S.C.838 g, h (1982); and the Pacific Northwest Electric Power Planning andConservation Act of 1980, 16 U.S.C. 839 (1982).The rate schedules contained in this publication were established, in accordancewith the Northwest Power Act, which was signed into law on December 5,1980. The proposed rate schedules reflect many requirements contained principallyin the Northwest Power Act's rate directives (section 7), as well as theconditions related to classes of customers and services contained in theNorthwest Power Act's power sales directives (section 5).BPA proposes that its transmission rate schedules and the General TransmissionRate Schedule Provisions (GTRSPs) associated with these schedules becomeeffective upon interim approval or final confirmation and approval by FERC.BPA will request FERC approval effective October 1, 1989. Section I.A.of the GTRSPs specifies the proposed effective period for each rate.The 1989 transmission rate schedules, and the GTRSPs associated with theserate schedules, are identical to BPA's 1987 rate schedules. They supersedeBPA's 1987 rate schedules (which became effective October 1, 1987) to theextent stated in the Availability section of each 1989 rate schedule. Twotransmission rates are referenced in existing contracts. These are theTGT-1 and UFT-83 rate schedules. Those rates are effective through June30, 1990. 39 FERC andpara; 60,078 (1978). BPA will request extension of TFT-1and UFT-83 through September 30, 1991.Many transmission agreements were negotiated prior to the TransmissionSystem Act and reflect conditions and policies prevalent at the time ofnegotiation. Provisions that differ between agreements include the typesof facilities available, type of service, frequency of rate adjustments,determination of losses, and calculation of billing determinants. Someagreements, for example, specify that transmission rates may be changedannually, while other agreements limit rate adjustments to once every 3years.Applicable legislation requires transmission system costs to be equitablyallocated between Federal and non-Federal power utilizing the system. Incases where BPA is required by contractual provisions to use a specificrate design method, such methods are used in this rate proposal.In developing the proposed transmission rates, BPA considered many factors,including revenue requirements, ease of administration, revenue stability,rate continuity, ease of comprehension, economic efficiency, and BPA'sstatutory obligations. The studies that have been prepared to support theproposed transmission rates will be available for examination on March8, 1989, at BPA's Public Information Center, BPA Headquarters Building,first floor, 905 NE. 11th Avenue, Portland, Oregon. The studies will bemailed to all parties to BPA's 1987 rate case. The studies also may berequested by phone or in writing from BPA's Public Involvement office andwill be available at the Prehearing Conference. The studies are:<ITAG tagnum="15">1. Revenue Requirement Study and Documentation.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">2. Revenue Forecast Study/Risk Assessment Study and Documentation.</ITAG>Persons seeking to become parties should not wait until the prehearingconference to obtain copies of the studies. Rather, potential parties shouldobtain the studies as soon as they are available so that they are conversantwith them at the time of the prehearing conference. Parties appearing atthe prehearing conference shall be required to state whether they willoppose BPA's rate proposal, provided that BPA will have first offered satisfactoryassurances that no substantive or procedural precedent shall arise by virtueof the substance, manner, or form of BPA's or any other party's actionin connection with the rate proposal, and that the extended rates sufferthe same entire or partial legality as the 1987 transmission rates. TheMarch 13 technical session is provided in order to assist parties in theirevaluation of BPA's proposal.To request either of the studies by telephone, call BPA's document requestline: 800-841-5867 for Oregon; 800-624-9495 for Washington, Idaho, Montana,California, Wyoming, Utah, and Nevada. Other callers should use 503-230-3478.Please request the study by its above title. Also state whether you requirethe accompanying technical documentation; otherwise the study alone willbe provided. (For example, ask for the ``Revenue Requirement Study andTechnical Documentation.'')<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Procedures Governing Rate Adjustments and Public Participation</ITAG>Section 7(i) of the Northwest Power Act, 16 U.S.C. 839e(i), requires thatrates be established according to certain procedures. These proceduresinlcude, among other things, issuance of a <T4>Federal Register</T4> notice announcing the proposed rates; one ormore hearings; the opportunity to submit written views, supporting information,questions, and arguments; and a decision by the Administrator based onthe record developed during the hearing process. This proceeding will begoverned by BPA's ``Procedures Governing Bonneville Power AdministrationRate Hearings,'' 51 FR 7611 (March 5, 1986), which implements, and in mostinstances expands, the statutory requirements. The proceedings for BPA'sproposal to readopt transmission rates will be combined with the proceedingsfor BPA's proposal for wholesale power rates.Among BPA's major customer groups, none have expressed opposition to theproposal to readopt rates. Thus, the Administrator firmly expects thatthe parties will not avail themselves of the opportunity for hearing affordedby BPA's procedures. In that event, and upon due and appropriate motion,the Hearing Officer will truncate the proceedings so that participantsmay be quickly heard and parties extended the opportunity to comment onthe Administrator's Draft Record of Decision. In the event a truncatedprocedure is adopted, the Administrator directs the Hearing Officer toincorporate by reference the Official Record compiled in BPA's 1987 WholesalePower and Transmission Rate proceeding into the Official Record of thisproceeding.The hearing will be conducted according to the rule for general rate proceedings,andSection; 1010.9 of BPA's ``Procedures Governing Bonneville Power AdministrationRate Hearings.'' BPA's procedures provide for publication of a notice ofthe proposed rates, a prehearing conference, the opportunity for hearing,receipt of written comments, preparation of decisional documents, a decision,and the transmittal of the decision with supporting documentation to theFederal Energy Regulatory Commission.  BPA distinguishes between ``participants in'' and ``parties to'' the hearings.Apart from the formal hearing process, BPA will receive comments, views,opinions, and information from ``participants,'' who are defined in theprocedures as any person who may express his views, but who does not successfullypetition to intervene as a party. Participants' written comments will bemade part of the official record of the case and considered by the Administrator.The participant category gives the public the opportunity to participateand have its views considered without assuming the obligations incumbentupon ``parties.'' Participants are entitled to participate in the prehearingconference, cross examine parties' witnesses, seek discovery, or serveor be served with documents, and are not subject to the same proceduralrequirements as parties.  Written comments by participants will be included in the record if theyare submitted before the close of the hearings. Written views, supportinginformation, questions, and arguments should be submitted to BPA's PublicInvolvement office.  The second category of interest is that of a ``party'' as defined in andSection;andSection;1010.2 and 1010.4 of the ``Procedures Governing Bonneville Power AdministrationRate Hearings.'' 51 FR 7611 (March 5, 1986). Parties may participate inany aspect of the hearing process.  Persons wishing to become a formal ``party'' to BPA's rate proceeding mustnotify BPA in writing of their request. These petitions to intervene shallstate the name and address of the person and the person's interests inthe outcome of the hearing. Petitioners may designate no more than tworepresentatives upon whom service of documents will be made. BPA customersand customer groups whose rates are subject to revision in the hearingwill be granted intervention, based on a petition filed in conformity withthis section. Other petitioners must explain their interests in sufficientdetail to permit the Hearing Officer to determine whether they have a relevantinterest in the hearing. Any opposition to a petition to intervene mustbe filed and served at least 24 hours before the March 16 prehearing conference.All timely applications will be ruled on by the Hearing Officer. Late interventionsare strongly disfavored. Opposition to an untimely petition to interveneshall be filed and served within 2 days after service of the petition.Intervention petitions will be available for inspection in BPA's PublicInformation Center, first floor, 905 NE. 11th Avenue, Portland, Oregon.Interventions are subject to andSection; 1010.4 of BPA's ``Procedures GoverningBonneville Power Administration Rate Hearings.''  The record will include, among other things, the transcripts of any hearings,any written material submitted by the parties and participants, documentsdeveloped by the BPA staff, and other material accepted into the recordby the Hearing Officer. The Hearing Officer then will review the record,will supplement it if necessary, and will certify the record to the Administratorfor decision.  The Administrator will develop the final proposed rates based on the entirerecord, including the record certified by the Hearing Officer, commentsreceived from participants, other material and information submitted toor developed by the Administrator, and any other comments received duringthe rate development process. The basis for the final proposed rates willbe first expressed in the Administrator's Draft Record of Decision (ROD).Parties will have an opportunity to comment on the draft as provided onBPA's hearing procedures. Absent comment, the Draft ROD will become Final.If comment is made, a Final ROD will be issued. The Administrator willserve copies of the Administrators Record of Decision on all parties andwill file the final proposed rates together with the record with the FederalEnergy Regulatory Commission for confirmation and approval.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Major Studies  </ITAG>A. <T3>Revenue Requirement Study. </T3>The Bonneville Project Act, the FloodControl Act of 1944, the Federal Columbia River Transmission System Act,and the Northwest Power Act require BPA to design rates that are projectedto return revenues sufficient to recover the cost of acquiring, conserving,and transmitting the electric power that BPA markets, including the amortizationof the Federal investment in the FCRPS over a reasonable period, and torecover BPA's other costs and expenses. The Revenue Requirement Study includesa determination that current rates will produce enough revenue to recoverall BPA costs and expenses, including BPA's repayment obligations to theUnited States Treasury.The Transmission System Act and the Northwest Power Act require that transmissionrates be based on an equitable allocation of the costs of the Federal transmissionsystem between Federal and non-Federal power using the system. In compliancewith a Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) order dated January27, 1984, 26 FERC andpara; 61,096, the Revenue Requirement Study incorporatesthe results of separate repayment studies for the generation and transmissioncomponents of the FCRPS. The repayment studies for generation and transmissiondemonstrate the adequacy of the projected revenues to recover all of theFederal investment in the FCRPS over the allowable repayment period. Theadequacy of projected revenues to recover cost evaluation period revenuerequirements and to meet repayment period recovery of the Federal investmentare tested and demonstrated separately for the generation and transmissionfunctions.The Revenue Requirement Study for the 1989 initial rate proposal is basedon revenue and cost estimates for FY 1990 and 1991. BPA's Revenue RequirementStudy reflects actual amortization and interest payments paid through September30, 1988. In addition, it reflects all FCRPS obligations incurred pursuantto the Northwest Power Act, including exchange costs.B. <T3>Revenue Forecast Study. </T3>The Revenue Forecast Study is dividedinto two parts. The first part, the Revenue Forecast, documents BPA's loads,resources, contracts, and revenues that are the basis for BPA's base caseforecast. The second part, the Risk Assessment, documents the various riskfactors and probabilities associated with these risk factors that causeBPA's revenues to vary. The Revenue Forecast Study also documents severalmodels that are used to prepare the Revenue Forecast and Risk Assessment,such as the load forecasting models, the Marketing Linear Programming Model,the Federal Secondary Energy Analysis, the Nonfirm Revenue Analysis Program,the Revenue Estimating Program, and the Risk Analysis Program.The Revenue Forecast separately identifies revenues by rate schedule includingPriority Firm, Variable Industrial, Industrial Firm, Surplus Firm, Nonfirm,Firm Capacity, and various transmission service charges (e.g., IntertieNorth, Intertie South, Formula Power, Integration of Resources, IncidentalNetwork Transmission, TGT, UFT, and Oandamp;M). It also accounts for otherrevenue sources such as WNP-1 exchange, the WNP-3 settlement, CoordinationAgreement (charges) revenues, USBR pumping power, and several other miscellaneouscategories of revenues. All of these revenues are documented for FY 1989-1991on a monthly basis in the Revenue Forecast.BPA's revenues are subject to significant variation due to several variables.To measure the impact of these variables on BPA revenues, BPA performsa Risk Assessment Analysis. The Risk Assessment Analysis examines fivevariables that have a significant effect on BPA's revenues and includeshigh, medium, and low forecasts for these variables. The five variablesare the economy (which includes aluminum prices and employment); marketingenvironment (which includes natural gas prices and contractual agreements);streamflow conditions (precipitation); thermal resource performance; andsettlement of WNP-1 exchange contracts. These events are assumed to beindependent of each other. A range of revenue outcomes is developed foreach year (FY 1989-1991) from 243 possible scenarios. Probabilities aredeveloped for each scenario based on the assumption that these events areindependent. Each revenue scenario is compared to the expenses for FY 1989and 1990 to determine whether or not the proposed CRAC would trigger inthe following year. The Risk Assessment Study explains this process ingreater detail and determines the likelihood that BPA revenues will exceedexpenses and be adequate to meet payments to the Treasury.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Transmission Rates</ITAG>Individual transmission rate schedules are discussed below.A. <T3>Formula Power Transmission (FPT). </T3>The FPT-89 rate schedule isavailable for the firm wheeling of power. The form of this rate includesa distance or mileage component for transmission lines and various transformationand terminal charges. The FPT rate form is designed to reflect a wheelingformula which has been prescribed historically by contract provisions.B. <T3>Integration of Resources (IR). </T3>The IR-89 rate is a flexible transmissionservice designed to reflect BPA's postage-stamp pricing policy. The IRservice does not recognize specific contract paths, but rather providesaccess to all FCRTS facilities contained in the definitions of Main Gridand Secondary System.A short-distance discount formula is included in the IR-89 rate. Utilitieshave a choice of either the FPT rate schedule or the IR-89 rate scheduleas the only rate to apply to all of their firm wheeling needs over MainGrid and Secondary System facilities of the FCRTS, except as otherwiseagreed by BPA. Utilities may choose the rate schedule that yields the lowertotal charge for transmission service.C. <T3>Incidental Energy Transmission (ET), Intertie (IN, IE, IS) Transmission,and Market Transmission (MT). </T3>Rate schedules on the Northern and SouthernInterties apply to all wheeled power on these segments, whatever the characteristicsof the power. The IE rate schedule applies only to nonfirm energy wheeledon the Eastern Intertie. The ET rate will be limited to intraregional FCRTSfacilities excluding the interties.The IS-89 rate consists of two parts: (1) a mills per kilowatthour rateapplicable to nonfirm use or hourly reservation of intertie capacity and(2) a $ per kW average cost-based rate for firm use, assured delivery.BPA is continuing its Market Transmission (MT-89) rate. This rate schedulewas developed for use among Western Systems Power Pool (WSPP) participantsand has a flexible service charge with a ceiling, initially of 33 mills/kWh,and a floor of 1 mill per kilowatthour.<ITAG tagnum="85">V.

AvailabilityThis schedule shall apply to all agreements which provide for the firmtransmission of electric power and energy over transmission facilitiesof BPA's section the Montana [Eastern] Intertie.Section II. RateThe monthly charge shall be one-twelfth of the sum of the annual chargeslisted below, as applicable and as specified in the agreements for firmtransmission. The Townsend-Garrison 500-kV lines and associated terminal,line compensation, and communication facilities are a separately identifiedportion of the Federal Transmission System. Annual revenues plus creditsfor Government use should equal annual costs of the facilities, but inany given year there may be either a surplus or a deficit. Such surplusesor deficits for any year shall be accounted for in the computation of annualcosts of succeeding years. Revenue requirements for firm transmission usewill be decreased by any revenues received from nonfirm use and creditsfor all Government use. The general methodology for determining the firmrate is to divide the revenue requirement by the total firm capacity requirements.Therefore, the higher the total capacity requirements, the lower will bethe unit rate.If the Government provides firm transmission service in its section ofthe Montana [Eastern] Intertie in exchange for firm transmission servicein a customer's section of the Montana Intertie, the payment by the Governmentfor such transmission services provided by such customer will be made inthe form of a credit in the calculation of the Intertie Charge for suchcustomer. During an estimated 1- to 3-year period following the commercialoperation of the third generating unit at the Colstrip Thermal GeneratingPlant at Colstrip, Montana, the capability of the Federal TransmissionSystem west of Garrison Substation may be different from the long-termsituation. It may not be possible to complete the extension of the 500-kVportion of the Federal Transmission System to Garrison by such commercialoperation date. In such event, the 500/230 kV transformer will be an essentialextension of the Townsend-Garrison Intertie facilities, and the annualcosts of such transformer will be included in the calculation of the IntertieCharge.However, starting 1 month after extension to Garrison of the 500-kV portionof the Federal Transmission System, the annual costs of such transformerwill no longer be included in the calculation of the Intertie Charge.A. Nonfirm Transmission Charge:This charge will be filed as a separate Rate Schedule and revenues receivedthereunder will reduce the amount of revenue to be collected under theIntertie Charge below.B. Intertie Charge for Firm Transmission Service:<ITAG tagnum="16">Intertie Charge = [(TAC/12-NFR) andmultiply; (CR^EC/TCR]</ITAG>SectionIII. DefinitionsA.
