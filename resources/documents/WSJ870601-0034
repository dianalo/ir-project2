The Japanese government's huge package of spending and tax-cut measures already has bolstered support for the dollar, many investment specialists contend. The dollar also has benefited from recent moves by Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone's government to discourage Japanese speculators from selling dollars.    &quot;There's no doubt the Japanese are the key&quot; to shoring up the foreign exchange and bond markets, says Lawrence L. Kreicher, senior international bond analyst at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets. The return of confidence in the dollar &quot;started in Tokyo,&quot; and that means &quot;a period of relative stability lies ahead for both the foreign exchange and credit markets.&quot;    Just two weeks ago, yields on actively traded 30-year Treasury bonds surged to 9.09%, the highest level since February 1986. But since then, the yield has fallen back to 8.64% as prices spurted nearly six points, or $60 for each $1,000 face amount. The rally could even go a bit further, many traders say, especially if President Reagan appoints Paul Volcker, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, to a third term.    &quot;There's a spreading perception the worst is over for the next several weeks at least,&quot; says William M. Brachfeld, executive vice president of Daiwa Securities America Inc. &quot;The fact is the dollar has stabilized, which could allow bond yields to fall another 15 basis points,&quot; to just under 8.5% on the latest 30-year issue.    &quot;Japan's efforts to stop the decline in the dollar through unprecedented oversight of its foreign exchange traders and fiscal stimulus at home has had a major impact,&quot; says James R. Capra, investment strategist at Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.    Richard Hoey, chief economist at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., agrees. &quot;The psychology that governments can't do anything was rampant among Japanese foreign exchange traders just a month ago,&quot; he notes. &quot;But the same foreign exchange traders in Tokyo are saying the opposite now after their firms responded to government pressure and covered their short positions in the dollar.&quot;    The Japanese government's economic stimulus package includes about $35 billion in public-spending outlays and around $7 billion of tax cuts. The package is &quot;constructive for the debt markets,&quot; says David H. Resler, chief economist at Nomura Securities International Inc. &quot;This isn't going to correct the trade imbalance overnight, but it does set Japan on a policy course consistent with a declining trade surplus and a more domestic production-oriented economy,&quot; he says.    Meanwhile, the U.S. economy remains &quot;quite weak,&quot; Mr. Resler says. He estimates the economy is expanding at an inflation-adjusted annual rate of only 1% this quarter, and &quot;perhaps a little less than that.&quot; He also predicts lower interest rates in the next six months or so, with the 30-year Treasury bond yield drifting back below 8% during that time.    Many analysts, though, aren't so optimistic. Robert A. Brusca, chief economist at Nikko Securities Co. International, agrees that the Japanese move &quot;was a good idea and will act to calm world capital markets and exchange markets.&quot; But he remains concerned about inflationary pressures in the U.S. and contends that interest rates aren't likely to go lower. &quot;I think we're in a trading range here&quot; with the 30-year Treasury bond hovering between 8 3/4% and 9%.    Mr. Capra of Shearson Lehman contends yields on long-term Treasury bonds likely will fluctuate between 8 1/2% and 8 3/4% as the dollar hovers between 142 and 145 yen. &quot;The markets are likely to have a positive tone the next couple of weeks,&quot; he says. &quot;But I still expect one last push down on the dollar before the end of the year and more weakness in the credit markets as a result,&quot; he adds.    Whatever the case, the recent stability in the foreign exchange and credit markets could boost the volume of new corporate and municipal offerings in the weeks ahead. &quot;I can see an increase in new corporate deals to as much as $4 billion a week,&quot; says Jason M. Elsas Jr., a managing director at Salomon Brothers Inc. Many issuers have canceled or postponed new issues the past month as interest rates surged.    &quot;There's also a suspicion that Japanese investors will be spending more money in this market again after a buying binge&quot; in British and German bond markets since April, adds Mr. Elsas, head of Salomon's bond syndication department.    Still, continued uncertainty about whether Mr. Volcker will be reappointed Fed chairman worries many investment managers and analysts. If Mr. Volcker isn't reappointed, &quot;I still believe that would hurt the financial markets in the short term -- even if his replacement is a person we all know and respect, like Alan Greenspan,&quot; says Kathleen M. Cooper, senior vice president and chief economist of Security Pacific National Bank in Los Angeles. She says Mr. Volcker commands &quot;an enormous amount of confidence in the financial markets here and world-wide.&quot;    Mrs. Cooper and many other analysts expect Mr. Volcker to remain at the helm of the Fed. &quot;The White House really doesn't have any choice,&quot; argues Raymond W. Stone, chief financial economist at Merrill Lynch Economics Inc. But many Fed observers predict Mr. Volcker probably won't commit himself to staying for a full four-year term. Instead, Mr. Volcker might agree to stay only until after the next president is inaugurated in January 1989.    ---   Friday's Bond Activity   The Treasury's 8 3/4% bonds due 2017 rose five-eighths of a point, or $6.25 for each $1,000 face amount, to a price of 101 4/32 from 100 15/32 Thursday. The yield on the securities declined to 8.64% from 8.71%. The government's 8 1/2% notes due 1997 rallied to 100 8/32 from 99 23/32 Thursday as the yield fell to 8.46% from 8.54%.    The rally began early in the day after the Commerce Department reported that its index of leading economic indicators fell 0.6% for April. That was a larger drop than many traders anticipated and helped revive speculation that sluggish economic growth would keep the Federal Reserve from tightening credit.    An index of long-term Treasury bonds compiled by Shearson Lehman rose 8.98 points to 1291.14. The high for the day was 1293.89, while the low was 1286.60.    Interest rates were mixed on Treasury bills. The rate on new three-month Treasury bills rose to 5.65% bid from 5.63%, while the rate on new six-month bills declined to 6.15% bid from 6.18%.    The federal funds rate, which is the rate on reserves that banks lend each other overnight, hovered around 6 5/8%, averaging 6.63%, according to an estimate by Fulton Prebon (U.S.A.). That was down from an average of 6.8% Thursday, according to the Federal Reserve. </TEXT></DOC>
