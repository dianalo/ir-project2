The shift means shift the open-loop to the feed-back controlafter the lapse of a time the length of which has a predetermined relationto the duration determined by the timing means. The set of values ofthe duration comprises a first set of values which are to be employedwhen the detected transient operating condition of the engine is an acceleratingcondition and a second set of values which are to be employed when thedetected transient operating condition is a decelerating condition.</TEXT></DOC>
