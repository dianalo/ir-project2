Soon, we'llhave more than 30,000.&quot;andM;Of those 12,500 nodes, 8,000 are Macs, and the number is growing at a rate offour to five Macs for every one IBM PC or compatible purchased.andP;  Motorola'snetwork, which includes manufacturing sites in Malaysia, design centers inTokyo, SPS' networking hub in the Phoenix area and regional offices inFrance, is stitched together with a wide-area thread of leased data lines andsatellite links using the TCP/IP networking protocol.andM;The individual geographical sites and their departmental backbones are linkedto this wide-area TCP/IP &quot;cloud&quot; with high-powered IP routers, and workgroupLANs sprout off each backbone via their own LAN gateways.andP;  But building thisideal network wasn't easy.andP;  In the case of AppleTalk, finding the rightequipment, vendors and software was a long process that is only now beginningto bear fruit.andM;Future vs.andP;  past.andP;  For the past three years, Buchholz and a team of 20 headedby George Ward, manager of network design and development, have overseen acomplete renovation of SPS' network topology.andP;  Working from a stringent andforward-thinking set of guidelines, Buchholz's group, under Ward, beganbuilding &quot;a network for the future.&quot;andM;Since SPS employs 40,000 people in more than 100 locations worldwide, thisproved no easy task.andP;  And while it may seem far-fetched to get 8,000 Macsonto one AppleTalk network, some breakthroughs in AppleTalk networking havehelped Buchholz's dream become a reality.andM;Before Buchholz and his team went to work, SPS' network resembled mostfar-flung corporate wide-area networks.andP;  &quot;In the '80s, the whole point was tojust make a connection, no matter how,&quot; Buchholz said.andP;  &quot;We had a lot ofasynchronous dial up requiring modems, cluster controllers and lines from anode to the mainframe.&quot;andM;To be fully connected, a node required as many as three network cards: onefor the local network, one for accessing corporate mainframes and sometimes athird dedicated to printing.andP;  The number of connections was eclipsed only bythe various protocols competing for time on the network, including NovellInc.'s IPX (International Packet Exchange); 3Com Corp.'s XNS (XeroxNetworking Services); AppleTalk; EtherTalk; DECnet; and various flavors ofUnix-based protocols, such as network file system from Sun Microsystems Inc.andO;Motorola also was using IBM Corp.'s proprietary Systems Network Architecture,a hierarchical topology that was not flexible or efficient enough, Buchholzsaid.andM;Buchholz summarizes Motorola's goal for the '90s: &quot;To develop a networkarchitecture to support the marriage of optimizing network performance andsecurity while continuing to pursue transparent, heterogeneous computerconnectivity.&quot;andM;The network of the '90s.andP;  SPS' &quot;one-point&quot; network gives a node access to anyresource, be it a mainframe, a modem, E-mail or outside services such as theInternet.andP;  It allows any protocol -- IPX, AppleTalk and Unix, for example --to run locally but uses only one standard protocol to pass informationbetween Motorola's various departmental backbones around the globe.andM;When choosing that standard, SPS gave top priority to security andperformance.andP;  AppleTalk was designed for smaller networks, and its built-inoverhead and inflexible addressing scheme make it a wash for large-scaleWANs, Buchholz said.andM;Instead, his group decided to allow only TCP/IP and DECnet, two wide-areanetworking stalwarts, through the global WAN.andP;  Because of its flexibleaddressing scheme and wide range of applications standards, TCP/IP has becomeSPS' lingua franca, serving as the common protocol between platforms,operating systems and application categories such as network management andE-mail.andM;AppleTalk is used for local Mac networks, but it can pass through the WANonly if &quot;wrapped&quot; into a TCP/IP or DECnet &quot;envelope&quot; by an intelligent routerand then unwrapped by another router at the other end.andP;  Working closely withthird-party vendors such as Cayman Systems Inc., Buchholz and his team havemade wide-area AppleTalk networking a reality.andM;Building tunnels, not bridges.andP;  &quot;AppleTalk is the biggest pain in the rear,&quot;Buchholz said as he explained how Motorola solved its wide-area AppleTalkdilemma.andM;Typically, companies link geographically disparate sites on a large AppleTalknetwork with bridges that link the two networks at the physical, ormedia-access-control, data-link layer.andP;  But AppleTalk &quot;is not a normalprotocol,&quot; Buchholz said.andP;  Simple bridging of AppleTalk carries with it ahuge amount of overhead.andP;  Nodes on an AppleTalk network are constantlybroadcasting their names, addresses and other network information to everyother node on the network.andM;AppleTalk is great for its &quot;plug-and-chug&quot; simplicity, he said, but if youwere to plug in 8,000 nodes, all of them broadcasting, there wouldn't be muchchugging going on.andP;  &quot;With all the name binding, ZIP (Zone InformationProtocol), routing tables and other information being passed, heaven help theactual data gram just trying to get some work done,&quot; Buchholz said.andM;To accommodate that many nodes with their associated peripherals and zones,SPS had to build intelligence into the network.andM;Buchholz and his team spent four to six weeks testing AppleTalk to discoverthe conditions under which it performed best, including the length and gaugeof the wire it traveled on and the bandwidth required for a viable AppleTalkWAN.andP;  Then, they came up with a golden rule.andM;&quot;We don't allow any bridging of AppleTalk on our network, period, because ofthe network overhead,&quot; Buchholz said.andP;  Instead, Buchholz specified the use of&quot;intelligent gateways&quot; capable of &quot;tunneling&quot; AppleTalk through a TCP/IP WAN.andM;Cayman Systems responded to Motorola's needs by developing new software forits GatorBox gateway, Version 1.5, that provided these services.andP;  Besidestunneling, or creating a link between AppleTalk networks via the TCP/IP&quot;cloud,&quot; the GatorBox also can be configured to filter out certain AppleTalkzones, allowing the network administrator to control what each user sees inthe Chooser.andP;  This feature allows the administrator to create tunnels linkingdepartments that need to work together and excluding those that don't.andM;These tunnels are maintained by passing only the routing tables, which tellthe GatorBox the status and address of each connected node, from one GatorBoxto another.andP;  An AppleTalk bridge, on the other hand, would indiscriminatelypass all network information from one network to the other.andM;Printing to Malaysia.andP;  Vicki Haro works in the documents control departmentof Motorola's Tempe offices.andP;  She is responsible for compiling detailedtechnical and engineering documents from various sources, including Motorolaengineers and third-party vendors across the country, and sending them to themanufacturing sites in Kuala Lumpur.andM;Before she was linked via SPS' peer-to-peer network, the creation andrevision of her documents was an arduous process that involved actuallycutting and pasting charts and graphics with scissors and glue, copying thedocuments on a copier and then mailing hard copy from one site to another.andO;Turnaround time often was more than a month for just one set of revisions.andM;Now that a tunnel has been created between her site and Malaysia, Haro pullsthe information she needs off a special server where it has been left byengineers and customers; cuts and pastes the document together using standardMac software such as Microsoft Excel and Word; and then sends the documentsdirectly to Malaysia via QuickMail, an E-mail package from CE Software Inc.andO;of West Des Moines, Iowa.andP;  If she needs to, she even can print the documentson a LaserWriter in Malaysia.andP;  &quot;It saves me at least four hours on everytable I create,&quot; Haro said, &quot;and at least two weeks each time I use E-mailinstead of regular mail.&quot;andM;Network services.andP;  By using TCP/IP, Macs can take advantage of all ofMotorola's network resources from one LocalTalk or Ethernet connection,Buchholz said.andP;  Instead of using an asynchronous dial-up line, a modem and acluster controller, users now establish a mainframe session with the TCP/IPprogram telnet, using native GatorBox and Macintosh software.andM;All E-mail across the WAN must first be translated into SMTP (Simple MailTransfer Protocol), TCP/IP's standard E-mail protocol.andP;  Again, Caymanprovides GatorBox software modules that translate both Microsoft Mail andQuickMail messages from AppleTalk to SMTP and back.andP;  This has made filetransfer from one Mac site to another is easy.andP;  &quot;We attach files to messages,and it all gets sent across the WAN with no other special instructions,&quot;Buchholz said.andM;Using the GatorBox translators, a Microsoft Mail user in Phoenix could evensend a message to a QuickMail user in Japan, and both users would see onlythe familiar interfaces of their respective programs, Buchholz said.andM;A network as large as SPS' demands special security and network management.andO;Every departmental backbone on the SPS WAN is given one of four securitylevels, each level more secure than the previous one.andP;  Level 3 security, forexample, requires a user name, password and static network-layer address foreach node.andP;  Furthermore, no node can be booted from the computer's diskdrive, so no one can get on the network without a name and password.andP;  A nodeon a Level 2 backbone cannot exchange information with a Level 3 node unlessit's been individually upgraded to Level 3.andM;Network management is performed using a Sun machine on a separate managementbackbone running SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol), a TCP/IP standardthat all of SPS' routers speak.andP;  To query an AppleTalk node, for example, theSun machine sends an SNMP request to the appropriate GatorBox, which thenpulls the necessary information from its own files and forwards it back tothe Sun.andM;Rewards.andP;  SPS' work has paid off.andP;  By converting to a peer-to-peer network,Motorola has saved almost $1.2 million this year in unnecessary and redundantleased lines, expensive analog-to-digital conversion equipment, and service.andO;That money has been used to build an even more extensive network of leasedlines to link overseas sites within the corporation.andM;SPS' network also has been chosen as the best in its class for heterogeneousnetworked computing by a panel of networking specialists at InterOp Inc. ofMountain View, Calif., a networking-industry association.andP;  Ward and the SPSteam flew to San Jose, Calif., to receive the award at the InterOp trade showthere last month.andM;But perhaps the greatest coup is the decision by Motorola corporate to followSPS' lead and implement a corporatewide peer-to-peer network using SPS'guidelines.andP;  This raises the possibility of a huge corporate WAN linking allof Motorola's 100,000 employees.andM;&quot;We'll all be one big, happy network someday,&quot; Buchholz said.andP;  With 12,500nodes now and 30,000 by 1992, it looks like they've made a running start.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
