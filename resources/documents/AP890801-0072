King took office Tuesday asSocial Security commissioner, promising to provide ``more efficientand humane'' service for beneficiaries and to safeguard trust fundreserves.   Mrs. King, 48, took the oath of office at Social SecurityAdministration headquarters near Baltimore with a pledge that theagency will ``serve only ... the public interest.''   ``My goal is a fairer, more efficient and humane Social Securitysystem,'' she said.   Mrs. King, a former congressional, state and federal aide, saidshe would defend Social Security reserves against those who wouldtap them for other purposes.   She said: ``It is imperative that the trust fund reserves besafeguarded to ensure a sound Social Security program for bothcurrent and future generations of beneficiaries.''   She also promised agency employees she would provide``leadership that stands up for you, especially when you think youmay be left standing alone.''   During the Reagan administration, the agency pared its workforce by about 20 percent to 65,000 employees as part of a plan tostreamline and modernize operations. Critics, however, complainthat the remaining employees are overworked, morale is low and thequality of service has declined.   ``SSA deserves leadership which respects and trusts itsemployees; leadership that will lead, but will also listen,'' Mrs.King said.   She was sworn in by Health and Human Services Secretary Louis W.Sullivan, who said the nation's retirement and disability benefitssystem rests in ``capable, caring hands.'' His department hasjurisdiction over the Social Security Administration.   The agency administers both the Social Security old age,survivors and disability benefits program and the SupplementalSecurity Income program for needy people who are aged, blind ordisabled.   More than 38 million Americans collect monthly Social Securitychecks totaling about $230 billion each year and another 4.1million receive monthly SSI benefits totaling more than $14 billiona year.   Mrs. King succeeds Dorcas Hardy, who announced in June that shewould resign effective Monday. Most recently, Mrs. King worked asexecutive vice president of the Washington government relationsfirm of Gogol andamp; Associates.</TEXT></DOC>
