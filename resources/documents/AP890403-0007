For an hour a day during the 10-day tournament, Japan's publictelevision network, NHK, is broadcasting via satellite the wider,crystal-clear pictures with sound quality similar to that ofcompact discs.   Millions of Japanese were expected to watch the tournament, butonly viewers watching on a few hundred specially equipped sets willsee the sharper images.   ``Because of the extra screen width, a broadcast of a baseballgame can show the pitcher winding up to throw to a batter andrunners on first and third base, all in the same picture,'' saidSosuke Yasuma, director of high-definition TV programs for NHK.``TV cameramen will need to relearn how to compose their pictures.''   The new technology creates its dramatically sharper images byusing about twice as many horizontal scanning lines and five timesas much video ``information'' as current television.   Industry officials say the technology, known as HDTV, willrevolutionize other industries that deal with images, such asprinting, graphic design and movie-making.   Some parts of the Olympic Games in Seoul, South Korea, werebroadcast on HDTV last fall. But this week's broadcast representsthe beginning of regular programming.   NHK next plans to broadcast a two-week sumo wrestling tournamentin May and then begin regular hourlong daily HDTV transmissions inJune.   Although few people will be watching at first _ the specialmonitors now cost about $60,000 and only several hundred have beenmade _ the broadcasts demonstrate Japan's lead over the UnitedStates and Europe in the race to commercialize HDTV technology.   At stake, NHK says, are potential worldwide HDTV sales estimatedat $80 billion by 1995.   In addition, countries that don't develop HDTV industries willhave difficulty competing in a wide range of future commercial andmilitary products, analysts say. HDTV ties together a variety ofadvanced technologies, including digital image processing,high-capacity satellite transmission, fiber optics andmicro-electronics.   Because of potential military applications such as in imagesensors for missiles or spy satellites, the U.S. Department ofDefense announced in December a $30 million program of grants todevelop an American HDTV system.   But U.S. industry officials and some congressmen call thePentagon program too little, too late.   ``The United States should have gotten into this long ago,''said John Stern, who represents U.S. electronics associations inJapan. ``Japan has already commercialized this technology, whilethe United States today is approximately six years behind.''   Japanese makers are so far ahead of U.S. companies that theycould quickly dominate the U.S. market if their system gainsinternational acceptance in the near future, Stern said.   Engineers at NHK began in the 1960s to develop an improved TVsystem they hoped would unify the world's seven current TV systems.Since then, under NHK leadership, Japanese companies reportedlyhave spent more than $700 million on HDTV development, with littlegovernment involvement.   In a crash program over the last two years, European companiesdesigned and produced a separate HDTV system. The European EconomicCommunity wants to begin consumer HDTV equipment sales andsatellite broadcasts by 1992.   Recently, South Korea announced it will spend about $150million, including $90 million from private companies, in afour-year effort to develop an HDTV industry.   But while European and South Korean companies have remainedstrong in consumer electronics, American companies would need torebuild an industry they largely abandoned or sold to foreign firms.   Except for Zenith Electronics, all major television factories inthe United States are now owned by overseas companies.   While HDTV will be broadcast in Japan and Europe directly fromsatellites on special frequencies, Federal CommunicationsCommission standards say U.S. HDTV broadcasts must use current TVchannels and be viewable on present televisions. But special HDTVmonitors would still be necessary for the improved picture quality.   Both Japan and Europe still hope their systems will be adoptedworldwide, at least for professional studio equipment such as videotape recorders and cameras.   ``We still wish Japan would see the wisdom of a single worldsystem based on the European standard, rather than trying to imposea non-compatible system on the rest of the world,'' said MichaelLake, spokesman for the EEC in Japan.</TEXT></DOC>
