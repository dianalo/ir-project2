Tom Campbell,R-Stanford, a liberal and a phony. Campbell said Herschensohn's ideas aredangerous and irresponsible.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Local  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  GOP CANDIDATES FIGHT OVER WHO'S REALLY RIGHT  </HEADLINE><TEXT>     U.S. Sen. John Seymour struggled to remain above the fray. But afterrefusing to take a stand on gay rights, he found himself excoriated by Rep.William Dannemeyer, R-Fullerton, as a flip-flopper in league with the&quot;homosexual movement.&quot;;   While candidates sparred before the media,operatives for Gov. Pete Wilson and allies of the White House worked quietlyin committee to water down several resolutions and bylaw changes that wouldshift power and attention toward the right wing of the GOP.;   The mostconfrontational exchanges were between Herschensohn and Campbell, who areseeking the GOP nomination for Democrat Alan Cranston's seat in the U.S.Senate.;   Asked at a news conference what he makes of Campbell's claim to bea &quot;new conservative,&quot; Herschensohn replied: &quot;Look, a new conservative is anold liberal. Anyone who says I'm a fiscal conservative but moderate or liberalon the other issues is a phony because Ted Kennedy will tell you he's a fiscalconservative. Who isn't going to be a fiscal conservative? You've got to benuts to say I'm for spending all your money.&quot;;   Herschensohn, who proudlysays he favors offshore oil drilling and is devoutly opposed to abortion,argued that &quot;conservatism doesn't just mean fiscal policy. . . . It's a partof a much broader philosophy. You either believe in that philosophy or youdon't. . . . But to call yourself a fiscal conservative -- the only one that'ssafe to say that you are -- is to me phony and cowardly.&quot;;   In addition tooutlining his position on the United Nations -- he is opposed to U.S.involvement except when the U.N. is acting in the interest of this country --Herschensohn also discussed his proposal for a flat-rate tax on income thatwould eliminate all deductions, and his call for the elimination of federaldeposit insurance to reform the banking industry.;   Campbell, who chose notto hold a news conference but rather to meet individually with reporters inhis hotel room, said Herschensohn is &quot;wrong, wrong, wrong&quot; on the issues.;  &quot;His proposals are dangerous to the economy,&quot; Campbell said, calling aflat-rate tax &quot;economic nonsense&quot; that, by eliminating the mortgage deduction,would deplete most people's savings and &quot;devastate the housing industry.&quot;;  &quot;His fiscal policies,&quot; Campbell said, &quot;would take what is a recession and putus into a depression.&quot;;   As for Herschensohn's longtime call -- prior to thePersian Gulf war -- to pull out of the U.N., Campbell said, &quot;If we had takenhis advice, we would not have been in the U.N. in August 1990 and PresidentBush would not have been able to muster the support of the Security Councilbehind our actions.&quot;;   Campbell also challenged the notion thatHerschensohn's anti-abortion stance is conservative, suggesting that his ownpro-choice stand is more in keeping with the concept of individual freedomfrom government intervention.;   For his part, Seymour rejected thecharacterization of him as less than conservative, asserting he would support&quot;absolutely no new taxes under any circumstances&quot; and emphasizing his supportfor parental choice in schools, perhaps including vouchers for privateschools.;   But on the issue of gay rights, Seymour appeared to contradictearlier impressions, refusing to say whether he opposes banning homosexualsfrom military service and declining to take a stand on AB 101, thecontroversial gay-rights bill awaiting action by Gov. Wilson.;   &quot;I oppose andabhor discrimination of any kind,&quot; Seymour said several times. He denied areport in a San Francisco gay newspaper quoting him as saying it had been a&quot;grave mistake -- one I deeply regret&quot; when he voted against a previousversion of AB 101.;   But he did acknowledge that in 1978, when he was mayorof Anaheim, he supported the unsuccessful Briggs Initiative that would haveprevented gays from teaching in public schools.;   Dannemeyer, informed ofSeymour's refusal to take a stand on gay-rights measures, respondedfuriously.;   &quot;Is he conducting one of his flip-flops?&quot; Dannemeyer asked.&quot;What's happening here is that John Seymour is beginning to feel the heat ofhis own colleagues&quot; in the GOP.;   &quot;It clearly indicates to me that hesupports the political agenda of the homosexual movement,&quot; argued Dannemeyer,the leading advocate in the GOP of what he calls the &quot;heterosexual ethic.&quot;;  As for Seymour's opposition to offshore oil drilling and his moderate stanceon endangered species, Dannemeyer suggested the senator is &quot;following the leadof the radical environmental community (which is) green on the outside and redon the inside.&quot;  </TEXT><BYLINE>  PHILIP J.
