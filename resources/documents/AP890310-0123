The modified P3 Orion surveillance aircraft will make 10high-altitude flights from Bodoe air force base to trace the sourcesand types of pollutants blamed for the ``Greenhouse Effect'' _ thegradual warming of the atmosphere.   From the ground, the Arctic may seem pristine in its frozenisolation, but from high altitudes it is not.   ``Sometimes visibility is reduced to a couple of kilometers,''said Russell Schnell, a University of Colorado atmospheric scientist.   ``Arctic air pollution is as bad as you'd find in any Americancity. It's as bad as the Denver brown cloud or the smog of L.A.''   He is one of 40 American scientists stationed at Bodoe, 540 milesnorth of Oslo, until April 20 to chart gases, chemicals, visibilityand temperatures for the Coordinated Eastern Arctic Experiment, a $2million study of polar pollution sponsored by the NationalOceanographic and Atmospheric Survey.   Schnell said his team also flew the Orion, a hurricane stalker insummer, from Canada and Greenland but ``came to Norway to get asclose as possible to the source of pollution'' for the project'smost comprehensive phase.   He said more pollution drifts over the pole from Norway than fromthe Arctic regions of North America because more people live in thefar north of Europe, where ground temperatures are moderated by thewarmth of the Gulf Stream.   In a telephone interview from the air base, Schnell said: ``Lookat Bodoe. It's at about the same latitude as Barrow, Alaska. Herethey grow potatoes. In Barrow it's too cold to grow anything. TheArctic is 1,000 times more polluted than the Antarctic becausepeople live in it.''   Twenty scientists and crew were aboard the Orion when it leftFriday for its mission over the pole and Svalbard, an Arctic islandoff the northwestern Norway.   Norwegian and Canadian scientists are assisting the U.S. studywith ground measurements to compare with figures recorded by theOrion's instruments as the plane passes six miles above the icepack, Schnell said.   This is the winter's second American-financed study of polarconditions form Norway. In a project sponsored by the NationalAeronautics and Space Administration, a modifed U-2 spy plane flewArctic missions to measure the ozone layer, which shields the earthfrom the sun's harmful ultraviolet rays.   Schnell said the Orion would measure such ozone-depleting gasesas halon and chlorofluorocarbons, known as CFCs. He added that ``wealso want data on carbon dioxide levels produced by burning fossilfuels and on partical pollution, such as dust and soot.''   Increasing scientific evidence shows that CFCs are destroying theozone shield. When CFCs reach the stratosphere 15-25 miles up, asmuch as 100 years after emission, they break apart and theirchlorine atoms deplete the fragile ozone layer. CFCs also trap heat,increasing Earth's temperature.   Scientists have said the phenomenon could cause dramatic climatechanges within decades that would increase the fury of tropicalstorms and raise the level of the seas, threatening coastal floods.   Rough estimates of the Arctic's condition probably will bereleased next month, Schnell said, with more precise figures tofollow in a year.   A seven-foot section of the Orion's wingtip was removed to housea radiometer for measuring the sun's rays, he said, and highlysensitive radar will gauge cloud and particle density.   ``We also will look for polar lows, small but fierce stormssimilar to hurricanes,'' the scientist said.   ``Long ago, whole Arctic island villages would sometimesdisappear and no one knew why. Polar lows probably swept themclean.''</TEXT></DOC>
