The use of weak magnetic fields gives anotherpossibility to vary the polarization of the atoms, additional to variationof the polarization of the exciting laser. We calculated in detail theinfluence of weak magnetic fields on the density matrix describing theexcited atoms, using generalized rate equations. We checked the resultsof our model experimentally, at the Na(3 {sup 2} S/sub 1/2/, F/sub l/= 2) {yields}(3 {sup 2} P/sub 3/2/, F/sub u/ = 3) transition, excitedwith circularly polarized light. We determined the polarization of theexcited atoms, by measuring the fluorescence light at various angles,as a function of both magnetic field strength and laser irradiance. Modeland experiment agreed very well. We applied our model to the associativeionization of the excited Na atoms. We measured the ion signal as a functionof magnetic field. Analyzing the results, we could determine a specificassociative ionization cross section, which is not accessible in ourexperimental geometry without the use of magnetic fields. Thereby weshowed that the application of magnetic fields in polarization dependencestudies can provide us with additional information about the process.</TEXT></DOC>
