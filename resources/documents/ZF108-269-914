 Many companies are not turning to hign-end 3-Dworkstations, referred to as superworkstations, to improve their chances inthis race.andM;The biggest hurdle in justifying the purchase of a superworkstation can bethe six-figure price tag.andP;  Like car enthusiasts who buy Ferraris and then endup driving them only on the neatly paved roads close to home, manyorganizations are hesitant both to buy expensive systems revved up with somuch speed and power and to drive them cost-effectively to theirdestinations.andM;But when used cost effectively, the data visualization that can be performedby a superworkstation can revolutionize the way research is done in an Randamp;Dlab.andM;For instance, by expressing the intricate nuances of scientific data in acurve, waveform or more complicated shape, superworkstations help researcherspick out anomalies and key data points that before were needles in thehaystack.andM;Seeing data this way, and seeing how it changes as models are altered,scientists can use the superworkstation as a type of graphical &quot;what-if&quot;generator.andM;Most importantly, many scientists and researchers have said superworkstationgraphics help them formulate questions about the results of theirexperiments, which then lead to findings that the researchers would not haveseen otherwise.andM;As important a research tool as superworkstations are, however, their truevalue can be spread far beyond the single-user desktop.andM;Besides running high-end graphics applications, superworkstations double ascompute servers in networked environments, supplementing departmentalcomputers and spreading their cost of ownership across a large number ofusers.andM;Typically priced between $75,000 and $275,000, superworkstation-classmachines perform more than 60 MIPS and boast drawing speeds of more than100,000 Gouraud-shaded polygons per second.andP;  This caliber of horsepowerprocesses large volumes of information fast enough to generate photorealisticimages, which can then be manipulated in real time.andP;  (See &quot;Compute vs.andO;graphics power in visualization,c below.)andM;THE PRICE FOR PERFORMANCEandM;But no matter how important a project may be to an organization, it'sdifficult to justify an investment of, say, $130,000 or more for asuperworkstation--plus $1,100 for installation, $1,600 per year for a basicwarranty, $40,000 for software and $2,500 for training--on a single-userbasis.andM;Chances are, a chief financial officer will still look askance at the MISmanager who proposes what appears to be a single-user solution costing morethan $175,000, unless it is clear that the investment has benefits that willoutweigh the costs.andM;At first, a CFO wil likely view the organization's low- or mid-rangeworkstations--which have 2-D and 3-D data visualization capabilities such asimage processing and surface modeling--as sufficient.andM;These most frequently used visualization tools usually cost between $15,000and $50,000 apiece, and what's more, the corporation most likely already ownsthem.andP;  It seems to be a simple matter of adding the appropriate software forabout $5,000 per workstation.andM;But typically, with 10-MIPS performance, no specialized graphics hardware,limited modeling and virtually no real-time manipulation capabilities, thesemid-range workstations just don't have enough compute power to handle acompany's serious visualization applications.andM;Superworkstations have found a home with users working on projects thatdemand number-crunching power along with advanced graphics power.andP;  Theseprojects include display-intensive applications like molecular modeling, andcompute-intensive uses such as fluid dynamics and finite-element analysis.andM;Many users, notably in medical and scientific research, develop their ownapplications.andP;  For example, hospital researchers are using superworkstationsto analyze tissue abnormalities, such as plaque lesions in arteries.andM;Researchers at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston are usingsuperworkstations for cranial reconstruction modeling in planning surgery onchildren born with facial deformities.andM;As simulators, high-end graphics and computational tools can often-times bejustified in terms of cost avoidance.andP;  Consider impact studies in theautomobile industry, where standard crash-testing of actual prototypes istime-consuming and expensive.andP;  It can cost a team of researchers severalmonths and several hundred thousand dollars to build a prototype.andM;A superworkstation running high-end visualization and computational software,however, can let researchers simulate crashes and analyze the results quicklyenough to influence care design prior to prototyping, and decrease a car'stime to market.andP;  Furthermore, the superworkstation--unlike the automobileprototype--does not get destroyed during the testing phase.andM;Time to market is a key influence in just about every industry.andP;  In the caseof pharmaceutical companies, it is imperative to obtain approval from theFood and Drug Administration, secure patents and bring a drug to market asquickly as possible.andM;Pharmaceutical researchers in particular call for Ferrari-classsuperworkstations.andP;  Without such a tool, researchers can often spend monthsbuilding room-sized replicas of a molecule to view it from a 3-D perspective.andO;Building a 3-D model manually instead of using a computer is, in theresearchers' words, tantamount to &quot;playing with Tinker toys.&quot;andM;Moreover, the superworkstation lets researchers manipulate molecular modelsin real time so they can see how various combinations of molecules can formnew compounds.andM;It's in this same context that the superworkstation earns its keep as acompute server.andP;  Once computational analyses are completed on thesuperworkstation, the results can be fed back into a low-to midrangeworkstation.andP;  There, the scientist or engineer can perform ongoing analyseseither in tabular form or by constructing a rough graphics visualization onthe workstation.andM;Having analyzed those results, a user can move back to the sharedsuperworkstation and perform real-time or animation graphics analysis on thedata to explore the results of the research scenario more fully.andM;Using a superworkstation, researchers can develop molecular models of morethan 20,000 atoms in a matter of minutes.andM;Similarly, aeronautical engineers examining the fluid dynamics of a newaircraft design can perform wind-tunnel simulations of speeds of i500 milesper hour.andM;Such capabilities provide scientists with new ways to explore the results oftheir research.andM;VISUALIZING RETURN ON INVESTMENTandM;Many sites justify the purchase of a superworkstation using two basiccriteria.andP;  First, the advanced graphics and computing power of thesuperworkstation must be necessary for product research or development,providing either a strategic advantage or development cost savings.andM;Second, it must be possible to leverage this advanced power--including itsadvanced price--across the network by using the superworkstation as a computeserver for other workstations and high-end PCs.andM;By distributing the use, and thus the cost, of a superworkstation acrossseveral users, and by using a more direct measure of product-developmentefficiency, the MIS manager will have a much easier time justifying theacquisition of a superworkstation.andP;  (See &quot;Cost benefits of sharingsuperworkstations,&quot; page 38.)andM;According to the latest DR Strategies survey, distributing compute poweramong many users is a common strategy.andP;  More than 25 percent of therespondents said they use a superworkstation as a server linked to DEC, Sunand Apollo workstations, and to PCs or PC compatibles.andM;So in the case of researchers and engineers working on a complex model thatrequires much computation, the cost justification can include an estimate ofthe man-hours that would be wasted waiting for less powerful workstations toperform the same calculations.andM;For example, if 10 chemical researchers, each earning $80,000 per year,perform non-mission-critical work for five hours a week while waiting formolecular model calculations to be completed, the company pays almost $2,000per week, or about $100,000 per year, in lost productivity.andM;This is a conservative calculation, performed without considerting the 30percent overhead generally figured for benefits, office space and othercosts.andP;  With these factored in, the cost of idle time would come to about$130,000 annually, bringing a return on investment in a $200,000superworkstation, in constant dollars, in about two years.andM;PURCHASING PLOYSandM;Given the rapid changes in technology, leasing a superworkstation may be amore attractive alternative than buying one.andP;  (For complete coverage onleasing vs.andP;  buying, see &quot;Hedging the future value of your high-techinvestment,&quot; DR, Jan. 8, page 39.)andM;There are many advantages to leasing equipment, but in the case ofsuperworkstations the most attractive may be that an operating lease providesa financially rewarding disposal at the end of the lease.andP;  At the time, thesuperworkstation can be replaced by newer, more powerful hardware, allowing acompany's researchers to stay on the leading edge of technology.andM;Another option at the end of an operating lease is to renew the contractmonthly at the original rates.andP;  If the customer opts to renew for one year,discounts of 25 percent to 30 percent of the original cost are generallyavailable, according to data from software leasing company Meridien SoftwareFunding of Deerfield, Ill.andP;  These can increase to 50 percent on leases thatare renewed for two years or more.andM;There are cost advantages to the operating lease, not the least of which isthat the payments can be expensed by 100 percent, so there is nocapitalization over more than one year.andP;  This means that acquisition costsare not applied to the corporationhs balance sheets and that no corporateliability is shown.andP;  This improves a companyhs cash flow and does not affectits credit line.andM;An &quot;unbundled&quot; lease would permit the company to purchase thesuperworkstation's software at the end of the contract, but relinquish thehardware.andM;Unlike hardware, software often appreciates in value over the lease becauseof the enhancements typically made to it during that time.andP;  What's more, ifthe next superworkstation the company acquries is compatible with thissoftware, keeping the software eliminates the time and cost the company wouldneed to invest in retraining users or adapting applications to new software.andM;But if purchasing a superworkstation is the route chosen, buyers should beaware that superworkstation vendors in particular often discount theirproducts steeply from the list price.andP;  According to the DR Strategies survey,users have received discounts as great as 50 percent from vendors, withdiscounts ranging between 21 percent and 25 percent being the most common.andM;Like most other computing hardware, the cost of superworkstations is likelyto drop over time.andP;  Given the general industry trend that the computing poweravailable for a given price doubles every 18 months, the prices ofsuperworkstations are sure to come down.andM;For example, one vendor has reduced the prices on some of itssuperworkstations by as much as 21 percent in less than a year, and also hasdropped the prices of all of its superworkstation offerings an average of 10percent since their introduction.andM;Even with such reductions, the cost of a superworkstation will remain highcompared with the more commonly used graphics workstations.andP;  But thesuperworkstation's visualization power--which can speed the development ofnew products and encourage scientists to ask the questions they never thoughtof before--will still be a necessary tool for any companiesandM;Some sites may plausibly use the superworkstation as a single-user computer.andO;But more companies are likely to share the power of a superworkstation amongseveral users, who can turn to its interactive graphics capabilities whennecessary.andP;  For these users, the superworkstation can double as both ahigh-speed compute server and a visualization tool that provides detailed,interactive graphics.andM;MIS managers who can demonstrate the need for a superworkstation in the dualrole of high-end graphics visualization tool and compute server should beable to win over even the most budget-conscious CFO.andP;  Although the CFO maybalk initially at the price of a Ferrari, he will eventually realize that alast-place finish is the race to market is no way to preserve a solid bottomline.andM;Strategic advantage is machines' paybackandM;In terms of return on investment, superworkstations may not be the mostrewarding expenditure, according to the most recent DR Strategies survey.andM;The survey queried MIS managers at VAX sites that already ownsuperworkstations or plan to buy them.andP;  It was conducted for DR by BetaResearch of Syosset, N.Y.andM;According to the survey, 40 percent of the respondents have not received afull return on their superworkstation investment, and another 20 percent donot know if they have received a payback.andP;  This indicates superworkstationsare used primarily in situations where strategic needs demand theircapabilities regardless of cost.andM;But of those who did figure return on investment into their purchasing plans,44.5 percent received a payback between one year and 18 months after theirpurchase.andM;The survey also showed that the desire for superworkstations is greatest atthose sites that already have some in place.andP;  Fully 43.3 percent of therespondents who already own superworkstations plan to buy more; 23.4 percentdo not currently own a superworkstation but plan to buy one.andP;  Just 30 percentsaid they own at least one superworkstation but do not plan to buy more.andM;Of those who plan to buy, the majority will do so soon, the survey indicated,with 35.6 percent of those with purchasing plans expecting to pull out theircheckbooks within six months.andP;  Another 37.8 percent said they plan to buywithin a year.andM;According to the respondents, one of the biggest concerns aboutsuperworkstations is the availability of software that can make use of theirpower.andP;  Seventy percent of the respondents expressed this concern, with 58percent saying that price was a major concern.andM;This may be because many respondents received substantial discounts off thelist price of their superworkstations.andP;  Nearly 17 percent bargained fordiscounts of 21 percent to 25 percent off the asking price, and almost 12percent knocked down the price between 40 percent and 50 percent.andM;Superworkstation speeds drug designandM;Painfree Pharmaceuticals, a small, ficticious drug manufacturer, is in therace to develop a new, non-addictive painkiller.andP;  Although Painfree has comea long way toward developing the drug, the MIST manager knows that other,larger pharmaceutical manufacturers are closing in on his company, which iswhy he is now looking at purchasing a superworkstation.andM;With a superworkstation, he figures, researchers working on the painkillerwill be able to generate new drug designs faster, as well as visualize testand simulation results more accurately.andM;But at $130,000 apiece, superworkstations are not cheap.andP;  The MIS managerknows that Paintree's chief financial officer will object to the purchase ofa superworkstation for each of the project's 10 researchers.andM;Examining the situation more closely, the MIS manager realizes that much ofthe scientists' work can be done at their existing graphics workstationswhile they use the superworkstation to run their complex modelingcalculations.andP;  When the scientists need to examine their models in detail,they can share use of the superworkstation's interactive graphics.andM;The MIS manager figures that by purchasing one superworkstation andnetworking it to the existing graphics workstations, he can spread the costacross all 10 users  The initial costs of such a setup would be $130,000 forthe hardware and $40,000 for the software; including tax, this initial cashflow would be $178.500.andM;In return, the MIS manager figures that the superworkstation will save eachresearcher about six hours a week--time the researchers normally spend makingpicks in the lab's baseball pool while they wait for their currentworkstations to finish calculating complex molecular models.andM;Collectively, this amounts to a savings of about $140,000 per year, given theresearchers' salaries and overhead.andP;  The MIS manager also figures thatsalaries and overhead will rise an average of 5 percent per year, bringingthe total five-year savings to $770,000.andP;  On the face of it, this looks likea good deal.andM;But the MIS manager also has to consider both depreciation and the cost ofmoney.andP;  Using the standard accelerated depreciation method over five years,he deducts $122,512 as expenses, which leaves him a taxable income of$647,488.andM;By using a discount rate of 11 percent for the cost of money, he comes to theconclusion that the deal is worth $24,769 to his company.andP;  Payback for theinvestment will come in 21 months.andM;That number is good enough to satisfy the CFO.andP;  And if Painfree's scientistscan beat the competition in securing a patent and federal Food and DrugAdministration approval for the new drug, the company will reap a substantialrevenue windfall.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
