(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Alligators once were threatened withextinction in Florida, but now they're all over the place and willbe subject to legal hunting this fall for the first time in 26years, a state agency has decided.   The Florida Game and Fresh Water Fish Commission agreed Fridayto hunting in 28 selected areas after the Florida Audubon Societychallenged rules that would have permitted a county-by-county orstatewide hunt.   Audubon officials said the larger hunt would have killed toomany alligators and wasn't what the Legislature intended when itpassed a law that lifted 'gator-hunting restrictions.   ``We did what they asked,'' said Scott Ball, a spokesman for thecommission. The designations were approved without debate.   ``The next step is to go to those areas and decide how manyalligators can be taken from each,'' Ball said.   The commission is scheduled to make that decision in July afterstaffers conduct an alligator census in the swamps and lakes.   The commission plans to permit 15 percent of the adult 'gatorsin each area to be harvested.   Alligator hunting and trapping was banned in the early 1960swhen the reptiles were threatened with extinction and they weregiven national endangered species status in 1973. They have sincemade a comeback and have been removed from endangered andthreatened species lists.   Biologists say there is no way to make a firm estimate of thestatewide population, but rough guesses have ranged from 1 millionto 6 million. Biologists say they have evidence the gators areoutgrowing their habitat and some may starve if the populationisn't reduced.</TEXT></DOC>
