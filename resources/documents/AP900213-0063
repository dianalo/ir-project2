There was confusion inside the right-wing party, and politicalobservers were divided about whether Shamir or Sharon had emergedvictorious from the stormy session Monday.   There is a lot of time for maneuvering because by Israeli law, aresignation has to be formally announced by a minister at a Cabinetsession. Then, a resignation letter is submitted to the premier,and it takes effect only 48 hours later.   Party activists today tried to persuade Sharon, the formerdefense minister and architect of Israel's 1982 Lebanon invasion,to withdraw his letter of resignation.   Sharon told Israel radio he had no plans to retract his threat,he also left a door open to compromise. He noted that he had quiton principle, and ``I would prefer certainly to stay in thegovernment.''   The impact on Middle East peace efforts of Sharon's resignationand of the chaotic Likud Central Committee meeting also remaineduncertain.   Sharon's departure from the Cabinet could remove an obstacle toU.S.-sponsored efforts to start peace talks with Palestinians,since he is the ringleader of the hard-line camp.   But Shamir, trying to hold the party together at the meeting,restated his opposition to at least some U.S.-backed compromisesfor starting peace talks.   Labor Party chief Shimon Peres said of Shamir's speech, ``Idon't think that this was a great contribution to the peaceprocess.'' Labor is Likud's partner in the coaltion government andadvocates compromise with the Arabs.   Sharon had protested the government's failure to end the26-month Palestinian uprising and ensure permanent Israeli rule inall of Jerusalem _ including the Arab eastern sector that wasannexed after the 1967 Middle East war.   The 90-minute session in Tel Aviv broke up about an hour laterafter Sharon interrupted an attempt by Shamir to win a show ofsupport for his peace initiative. The plan calls for electionsamong Palestinians in the occupied lands.   Hundreds of arms went up in Shamir's support, but Sharon shoutedinto a microphone: ``Who is for liquidating terror?''   His supporters responded with cries of ``Arik! Arik!'' Sharon'snickname.   Both leaders claimed they won, and Shamir walked out.   After a two-hour cooling-off period, Shamir held areconciliation meeting with key Sharon backer and Deputy PremierDavid Levy, who is a leading contender for party leader afterShamir.   Winning Levy's support, or neutralizing his backing for Sharon,could significantly enhance Shamir's image.   The Moroccan-born Levy, a former construction worker, is arepresentative of the largely disadvantaged Sephardic community ofMiddle Eastern and African Jews, a major power base of Likud.   Levy planned to meet today with Sharon and his supporters topersuade him to stay in the Cabinet, officials said.   While the chaos seemed almost normal for Israeli politics, somepoliticians and editorial writers expressed worry over the disorderin Likud and the uncertainty over who rules the party.   ``A body that cannot rule itself will find it hard to rule thestate,'' said Mordechai Gur, a Labor member.   The conservative Maariv daily wrote that Israel's image was``hurt badly by what happened yesterday ... and Israel has enoughproblems already.''</TEXT></DOC>
