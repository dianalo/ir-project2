KNUTSON</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Senate opened debate on the U.S.-Sovietmedium-range missile treaty Tuesday, just over a week beforePresident Reagan leaves for the Moscow summit.   Not long after the debate opened, Reagan renewed his appeal forquick action on the pact, saying it ``has placed U.S.-Soviet armsdiscussions on a path that goes beyond arms control and toward realnuclear arms reduction.''   Reagan entered the White House briefing room to say he is ``bothhopeful and confident that after careful consideration, the Senatewill agree that this treaty is a diplomatic milestone and give itsconsent to United States participation.''   The White House wants the Senate to act quickly enough to alowReagan to go to Moscow with a ratified treaty. Senate MajorityLeader Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., said he too hopes the president cantake to the summit ``the treaty with a blue ribbon on it.''   But there is no guarantee the Senate will be able to act beforeReagan meets Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev in the Kremlin onMay 29. The president is to leave Washington next Wednesday for arest stop in Finland before going on to Moscow.   As debate opened Tuesday afternoon, Byrd said the exhaustivescrutiny to which the accord has been subjected should prove auseful ``civics lesson'' to both the White House and Kremlin thatthe Senate's role in the approval of treaties is ``not symbolic,that it is not a rubber stamp, that the Senate will not just rollover and play dead.''   ``It's time to roll up our sleeves and go to work,'' said SenateRepublican leader Bob Dole of Kansas. ``There's no reason thepresident should not have the treaty to ratify in Moscow.''   ``When Ronald Reagan steps off Air Force One onto Russian soil,I want Mr. Gorbachev to know that he's facing a man with the solidbacking of Congress and the American people,'' Dole said.   Dole said the Senate should aim at ratifying the treaty on nextWednesday, the day the president leaves on his Moscow trip.   Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., urging approval of the pact, saidthe treaty spells ``the beginning of the end of this mindless raceto add ever more nuclear weapons.''   But Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., the treaty's leading Senateopponent, repeated a litany of complaints about the treaty, andsaid the Reagan administration is promoting the pact with ``snakeoil claims.''   Helms complained that the treaty requires only the destructionof missiles, not their nuclear warheads.   ``The official U.S. claim is that this treaty removes fromEurope an entire class of nuclear weapons, Helms said and added:``There is an old song called, `It Ain't Necessarily So.'   ``I have a hunch that if Ronald Reagan were running forpresident this year instead of being in his last year in office hewould be out on the hustings demanding the Senate reject thistreaty,'' Helms contended.   Vote counts show that Helms is badly outnumbered in hisopposition to the treaty and that it is likely to be ratified byfar more than the required 67 votes, two-thirds of the Senate ifall 100 members are present and voting.   But Helms said the odds make no difference to him.   ``I am going to vote against ratification even if I am the onlysenator to do so,'' he said.   Sen. Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., the chairman of the ForeignRelations Committee, said the treaty has only small militarysignificance, because it eliminates only about 5 percent of themissiles in the two superpowers nuclear arsenals.   Its importance, he said, is because it represents ``a small butvitally important step ... towards more substantial armsreduction,'' Pell said. ``It is of immense psychological andpolitical importance.''   Pell said the terms of the pact strongly favor the UnitedStates, however, because it requires the destruction of missilescapable of carrying four times as many nuclear warheads than theU.S. missiles which are to be eliminated.   The Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces or INF treaty requires thedestruction of all ground-launched medium-range missiles with arange of between 300 miles and 3,400 miles.   The ground-breaking arms control pact has been underconsideration by three Senate committees since the beginning of theyear, but Senate debate on ratifying it was delayed by last-minuteproblems.   Byrd announced Monday that all roadblocks had been cleared by anagreement reached in Geneva last week between Secretary of StateGeorge P. Shultz and Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze.   Byrd said the Senate's Foreign Relations, Intelligence and ArmedServices committees were satisfied that the agreement had resolvedmisunderstandings over the implementation of the treaty's on-siteinspection provisions.   Additionally, the committees said Shultz had succeeded inwinning Soviet agreement to endorse the U.S. position that thetreaty bans all medium-range weapons, including those usingfuturistic technology such as laser rays, particle beams andhigh-power microwaves.   ``I feel that it is a good treaty, much better than it was whenit was first sent to the Hill,'' Byrd told the Senate on Tuesday.   ``That is a tribute both to the Senate and to theadministration,'' he said, praising the three committees, which hesaid ``insisted there were loose ends that needed to be tied.''   ``I hope the treaty will be approved, will be ratified, and itis not unreasonable to hope that it will be done before thepresident leaves for the summit,'' Byrd said. ``That will be ourmain goal. Delay for the sake of delay is certainly not one of theapproaches I would embrace.</TEXT></DOC>
