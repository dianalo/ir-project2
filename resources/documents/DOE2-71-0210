EMNRD submitted this proposal to DOE inresponse to DOE Solicitation No. DE-PS01-86CE64606, ``Developmental StatePrograms for Institutional Conservation.'' The proposal provided fora variety of energy efficiency services to be provided to small, ruralpublic school districts in New Mexico. This group of institutions historicallyhad one of the lowest participation rates in energy conservation programsin New Mexico. Typically, these institutions had limited resources availableto become involved in such activities. This report describes the activitiesthat were conducted under DOE Grant No. DE-FG01-86CE64615 by EMNRD. Thisreport consists of five volumes and a separate executive summary: thefirst volume describes the project; the second, third and fourth volumescontain copies of energy evaluations that were conducted for all participatingpublic school districts; and the fifth volume contains copies of othermaterials that were developed under the project.</TEXT></DOC>
