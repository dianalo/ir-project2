These amendments will provide greater uniformityin program administration and delete repetitive provisions. This interimrule also amends Part 1421 by revising: (1) The date by which a producermust reapply for a price support loan in the event the Commodity CreditCorporation (``CCC'') has not disbursed the loan proceeds within a specifiedtime; (2) the manner in which price support rates are determined when adjoiningtowns in different counties are considered to be one shipping point; (3)the information which must be entered on a warehouse receipt in order forsuch receipt to be used in obtaining a price support loan; and (4) thegrade requirements which must be met by commodities pledged as collateralfor a warehouse-stored price support loan. These amendments will providefor greater program uniformity.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATE:</T2> Effective June 3, 1988.

It has been determined that the provisionsof this rule will not result in: (1) An annual effect on the economy of$100 million or more; (2) major increases in costs or prices for consumers,individual industries, Federal, State or local government agencies, orgeographic regions; or (3) significant adverse effects on competition,employment, investment, productivity, innovation or on the ability of UnitedStates-based enterprises in domestic or export markets.It has been determined that the Regulatory Flexibility Act is not applicableto the interim rule since Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service(ASCS) nor the Commodity Credit Corporations (CCC) is required by 5 U.S.C.553 or any other provision of law to publish a notice of proposed rulemakingwith respect to the subject matter of this rule.It has been determined by an environmental evaluation that this actionwill have not significant impact on the quality of the human environment.Therefore, neither an Environmental Assessment nor an Environmental ImpactStatement is needed.This program/activity is not subject to the provisions of Executive Order12372 which requires intergovernmental consultation with State and localofficials. See the Notice related to 7 CFR Part 3015, Subpart V, publishedat 48 FR 29115 (June 24, 1983).Currently the regulations which set forth the terms and conditions of theCCC production adjustment programs are set forth at 7 CFR Part 713 andthe terms and conditions under which CCC may make payments in a form otherthan cash are set forth at 7 CFR Part 770. Generally, those regulationswhich are set forth in Chapter VII of Title 7 of the Code of Federal Regulationspertain to the functions of ASCS, including the functions which relateto the implementation and administration of CCC programs. The regulationswhich are set forth in Chapter XIV of Title 7 of the Code of Federal Regulationspertain to the functions of CCC. Therefore, it has been determined thatthose regulations which are currently set forth at 7 CFR Parts 713 and770 are more properly suited for codification in Chapter XIV of Title 7of the Code of Federal Regulations since the activities which are governedby these regulations are CCC functions. Accordingly, it would be more appropriateand clearer to interested persons to have these regulations within ChapterXIV, Commodity Credit Corporation, Department of Agriculture. The new sectionnumbers for each of the existing sections are provided in the table below:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,tp0,i1,s10,7-8</C> <H1>Old Section</H1><H1>New Section</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">713.1-713.157<D>1413.1-1413.157</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">770.1-770.7<D>1470.1-1470.7</D></ITAG></ITAG>The regulations which are set forth at 7 CFR Part 1421 set forth the termsand conditions under which CCC will make available price support loansand purchase agreements for barley, corn, farm-stored peanuts, oats, rye,sorghum, soybeans, rice and wheat. Currently, the regulations which areapplicable to all such commodities are set forth in andSection;andSection;1421.1-1421.30and all other regulations are set forth in individual subparts which areapplicable to each such commodity. Since the program provisions which governprice support loans and purchase agreements for these commodities are identicalin many instances, it has been determined that it would be more efficientto have all loan and purchase agreement provisions codified in one subpartof 7 CFR Part 1421.The regulations at 7 CFR 1421.6(a)(2) currently provide that if CCC doesnot disburse price support loan proceeds by the last day of the calendarmonth following the month in which the loan application is made, the producermust reapply for the loan. Based upon the current level of price supportloan activity and the time needed by CCC to process loan applications,it has been determined that producers should not be required to reapplyfor such loans during such a short period of time. Accordingly, in orderto alleviate the need for most producers to reapply for such a loan, thisinterim rule amends 7 CFR 1421.6(a)(2) to provide that a producer mustreapply for a price support loan only if the loan has not been disbursedwithin 30 days of the final loan availability date, or such other dateas may be announced by CCC.The regulations at 7 CFR 1421.59, 1421.99, 1421.219, 1421.254, 1421.344,1421.374, and 1421.470, provide for the adjustment of the basic countysupport price for barley, corn, sorghum, oats, rye, soybeans and wheat,respectively, in the event two or more CCC-approved warehouses are locatedin the same or adjoining towns which have the same freight rate even thoughsuch warehouses are located in the same county. In such an event, the supportrate is the highest of the support rates involved. Due to the deregulationof most freight rates, and due to changes in commodity marketing, it hasbeen determined that it is no longer appropriate to adjust the basic countysupport price for these commodities under these circumstances. Accordingly,these provisions are not included in the revised price support loan andpurchase provisions of 7 CFR Part 1421. The regulations at 7 CFR 1421.18(c)(3) currently set forth some of theterms and conditions with respect to the reconcentration of grain pledgedas collateral for price support loans. The reconcentration of certain commoditiesresults in an adjustment to the basic county loan rate to reflect costsincurred in movement of loan collateral. CCC recently amended the regulationsat 7 CFR Part 1421 to provide for a more uniform administration of CCC'spolicies with respect to increasing basic county loan rates to reflectcosts incurred in the movement of CCC loan collateral. (See 53 FR 6131,dated March 1, 1988). Accordingly, in order to conform to this previousamendment, this interim rule deletes references in 7 CFR 1421.18(c)(3)with respect to the method used by CCC in adjusting basic county loan rateswhen the reconcentration of CCC loan collateral is approved. The regulations at 7 CFR 1421.9 currently set forth the information whichmust be specified on warehouse receipts which are tendered to CCC in connectionwith a price support loan or purchase agreement. This interim rule amends7 CFR 1421.9 by setting forth with greater specificity those entries whichmust be included on such a warehouse receipt. This amendment will providegreater uniformity in the administration of CCC price support programsand will assist CCC in determining with greater accuracy the quality andlocation of: Grain pledged as collateral for price support loans; grainacquired through price support purchase agreements; and grain acquiredthrough price support loan forfeitures. The individual commodity subparts for barley, corn, sorghum, oats, rice,rye, soybeans and wheat set forth the grade requirements which must bemet by commodities pledged as collateral for warehouse-stored CCC pricesupport loans. This interim rule combines these provisions at 7 CFR 1421.18,and also incorporates new grading requirement terminology which is currentlyused by the Federal Grain Inspection Service. In addition, this interim rule makes changes throughout 7 CFR Part 1421for purposes of grammar and clarity. Since producers will soon be pledging as collateral for CCC price supportloans 1988-crop commodities, it has been determined that this interim rulewill become effective upon publication in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>. Comments, however, are requested and will betaken into consideration in developing the final rule. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects </ITAG>7 CFR Part 713 Feed grain, Rice, Upland and extra long staple cotton, wheat and relatedprograms. 7 CFR Part 770 Commodity certificates, In kind payments, other forms of payment. 7 CFR Part 1413 Feed grain, Rice, Upland and extra long staple cotton, and wheat and relatedprograms. 7 CFR Part 1421 Grains, Loan programs/agriculture, Price support programs, warehouses.Accordingly, Title 7 of the Code of Federal Regulations is amended to readas follows: <ITAG tagnum="52">PART 1421_[AMENDED]</ITAG>1.

All note and security agreements, purchase agreementsand related documents necessary for the administration of price supportprograms shall be determined by CCC and are available at State and countyoffices. In order to receive price support for a crop of a commodity, aproducer must execute a note and security agreement or purchase agreementon or before:(1) January 31 of the year following the year in which the crop of peanutsis normally harvested for additional peanuts pledged as collateral fora farm-stored loan; (2) March 31 of the year following the year in which the following cropsare normally harvested: Quota peanuts pledged as collateral for a farm-storedloan; barley; oats; rye; and wheat;(3) April 30 of the year following the year in which the crop of peanutsis harvested for quota peanuts tendered for purchase; and(4) May 31 of the year following the year in which the following cropsare normally harvested: Corn, sorghum; rice; and soybeans.(b) <T3>Quality and quantity. </T3>(1) Commodities must be tendered to CCCby an eligible producer and must be in existence at the time of disbursementof loan or purchase agreement proceeds. Such commodities must also be merchantablefor food, feed, or other uses determined by CCC and must not contain mercurialcompounds, toxin producing molds, or other substances posionous to humansor animals. Such commodities must not contain more than two rodent pelletsor comparable amounts of other filth per 1,000 grams of wheat or one percentor more by weight of kernels visibly damaged by weevils or other insects.(2) With respect to barley, corn, oats, sorghum, soybeans, rice, rye, andwheat, the determination of class, grade, grading factors, milling yields,and other quality factors shall be based upon the Official Grain Standardsof the United States and the Official Rice Standards of the United Statesas applied to rough rice whether or not such determinations are made onthe basis of an official inspection.

The producer must always have had the beneficial interestin the commodity unless, before the commodity was harvested, the producerand a former producer whom the producer tendering the commodity to CCChas succeeded had such an interest in the commodity. Heirs who succeedto the beneficial interest of a deceased producer or who assume the decedent'sobligations under an existing loan or purchase agreement shall be eligibleto receive price support whether succession to the commodity occurs beforeor after harvest so long as the heir otherwise complies with the provisionsof this Part. Such succeeding producer must assume a substantial interestin and responsibility for production of the commodity. Mere purchase orinheritance of a crop prior to harvest without the acquisition of any additionalinterest in the farm on which the crop is produced shall not constitutesuccession of a beneficial interest. (2) A producer shall not be considered to have divested the beneficialinterest in the commodity if the producer enters into a contract to sellor gives an option to buy the commodity if, under the contract or optionthe producer retains control, risk of loss and title to the commodity subjectto such agreement and retains control of the production of the commodity.Commodities obtained by purchase shall not be eligible to be tendered toCCC for price support.(3) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs (c) (1) and (2) of thissection, a producer may pledge as collateral for a loan commodities inwhich the producer does not have a beneficial interest if CCC determinesthat the producer has a quantity of a commodity which is eligible to receiveprice support and that the commodities tendered to CCC will receive pricesupport in an amount not to exceed the amount which would have been providedwith respect to the eligible commodities. If CCC approves such a requestfor price support, the producer shall not otherwise receive price supportwith respect to the eligible commodity, except as may be determined andannounced by CCC. Any such request must be made in the manner prescribedby CCC and must be made at the county office which is authorized to makea price support loan to the producer. (4) If price support is made available to producers through an approvedmarketing cooperative in accordance with Part 1425 of this chapter, thebeneficial interest in the commodity must always have been in the producer-memberwho delivered the commodity to the cooperative except as otherwise providedin this subsection. Commodities delivered to such a cooperative shall notbe eligible to receive price support if the producer-member who deliveredthe commodity does not retain the right to share in the proceeds from themarketing of the commodity as provided in Part 1425 of this chapter.(d) <T3>Redeemed loan collateral. </T3>Except with respect to commodities whichhave been acquired in accordance with Part 1470 of this chapter and withrespect to commodities which have been redeemed at a rate which is lessthan the original price support level, a producer may, before the finaldate for obtaining a price support loan for a commodity, reoffer as collateralfor such a loan any commodity that had been previously pledged as collateralfor a price support loan. The subsequent loan shall have the same maturitydate as the original loan. 8.
