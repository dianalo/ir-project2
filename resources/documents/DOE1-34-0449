<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-34-0449 </DOCNO><TEXT>A microcomputer-based medial consultation system, GYCON, has been developedfor application in gynecology. It is intended to provide a physicianor a medical student with the &quot;second opinion&quot; or reinforcement on decisionsof a diagnostic option and treatment regimes. GYCON consists of threemain parts: the editor, the information retrieval system, and the diagnosticreasoning system. With the editor, information in the knowledge basecan be changed or deleted and new information such as a new disease orsomething as simple as an additional symptom of a particular diseasemay be added. Information in the knowledge base can be retrieved forreview through the use of the information retrieval procedures. The diagnosticprocess is comprised of rules which act in conjunction with the knowledgebase and patient specific data to render a diagnosis. The knowledge baseof the gynecological consultant contains an adequate body of knowledgeabout the population of known gynecologically related infectious diseasesand common pathological conditions. The formulation of the knowledgebase is based on a diagnostic model used by gynecologists to arrive ata diagnosis given the status of a patient. The diagnostic model assumesthat diseases are independent and only one disease is present at anyone time in the patient.</TEXT></DOC>
