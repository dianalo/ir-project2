East Germany's new premier said the Berlin Wall must remain, tokeep AIDS, crime and other Western problems out of his country. Hepromised a coalition government but did not say whether theopposition could join it.   After a week of dramatic developments in East Europeancountries, President Mikhail S. Gorbachev of the Soviet Union saidin Moscow:   ``They have a common direction, which fosters the building of aEuropean home, for it makes the countries closer, more open andcreates new opportunities for human contact and an equal exchange.''   The Liberal Democrats, an East German party that is allied withthe Communists but shows signs of independence, said pro-democracygroups should be invited in ``round-table'' talks about EastGermany's future.   Discussions this spring between Polish authorities andSolidarity, which were given that name, led to a non-Communistgovernment in Poland.   Mayor Walter Momper of West Berlin said the sudden opening ofEast Germany's borders was creating traffic jams, currency problemsand other economic difficulties the two governments must resolve.   Economics Minister Helmut Haussmann of West Germany announced asix-point aid plan including investments, joint ventures andmodernizing East Germany's dilapidated communications and transportsystems.   Haussmann did not name a figure for the aid and said EastGermany must achieve ``thorough change'' in its centrally directedeconomy.   Reforms promised so far by Communist Party leader Egon Krenz,who took over last month from hard-liner Erich Honecker, haveresulted in more questions than answers, Haussmann said in Bonn.   He compared his proposal to the Marshall Plan devised bySecretary of State George C. Marshall, which provided more than $12billion in American aid in 1948-51 to help Europe recover from thewar.   East German authorities have rejected the idea of adopting acomplete free-market system and new Premier Hans Modrow, a leadingreformer, says he wants ``step by step'' economic changes.   Modrow appears to want a streamlining of the bureaucracy, buthas given no indication he will urge sweeping changes such as thosein Hungary and Poland.   He was quoted Tuesday in the West Germany newspaper Bild assaying the Berlin Wall can remain open to travel, but will not comedown.   ``In our country there is little criminal activity ... cases ofAIDS and drugs are virtually unknown,'' he was quoted as saying.``Our people are asking themselves why they shouldn't just leavethat as it is.''   ADN, the official news agency, said the government might open apart of the wall near the Brandenburg Gate as yet another passagebetween East and West Berlin. The high-columned monument is nearthe wall in East Berlin and is among the city's best-known symbols.   Before East Germany opened its borders Thursday, the gate hadbeen a major rallying point for demonstrators seeking freedom totravel to the West. Hundreds of West Berliners gathered thereTuesday in hopes a hole would be opened.   A leader of New Forum, East Germany's main opposition group,said it could work with a revamped Communist Party but namingModrow premier was not enough.   ``There are still too many people in top positions with whomdialogue is not possible,'' Juergen Tallig, spokesman for the groupin Leipzig, said in a West German radio interview.   More change could occur at a special party congress in EastBerlin on Dec. 15-17. The congress, which can change the entireleadership, set policy and alter party statutes, was called lateMonday by the party Central Committee.   Pro-democracy advocates have held huge demonstrations demandingan end for the 40-year Communist monopoly on power. Although Modrowdid not indicate whether the opposition would be allowed in hiscoalition, he pledged to seek more cooperation with the four smallparties allied with the Communists.   Guenter Schabowski, one of the most prominent Politburo membersand a leading reformer, resigned as party chief for East Berlin,ADN said, and was replaced by Hans Albrecht.   Schabowski had indicated earlier he might surrender the postbecause of a heavy workload. He still is the party propaganda chiefand political analysts believe he may get an important job inModrow's cabinet.   Guenther Maleuda, the new, non-Communist speaker of Parliament,said he would seek to alter the first article of the constitution,which defines the Communist Party's leading role in society. Theparty has used the provision to defend its power monopoly.   The East German Red Cross said its reception centers couldhandle up to 10,000 East Germans returning home. The West GermanRed Cross said it expected several thousand of the 200,000 who hadsettled in the West this year to return to East Germany.   Mass emigration has cost East Germany vital skilled workers andhas strained the ability of West Germany to provide jobs andhousing.</TEXT></DOC>
