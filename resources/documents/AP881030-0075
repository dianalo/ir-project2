(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Three tickets were sold with the sixnumbers needed to win California's $60.8 million lottery jackpot,the largest in the world, officials said Sunday.   Each of the tickets is worth a third of the jackpot. A pool of15 hospital workers in San Diego County jubilantly claimed Sundaythat it held one of the winning tickets. However, lottery spokesmanBob Taylor said he could not confirm that until the ticket stub isverified, probably on Monday.   The two other tickets with the six winning numbers werepurchased in Westminster in Orange County and in Sacramento, Taylorsaid. Winners in those areas had not come forward.   Workers at Fallbrook Hospital told The Associated Press theywent together to purchase $600 worth of tickets.   Carrie Dragon, a 38-year-old pharmacy technician, said shejoined 13 nurses, lab technicians and other hospital employees, aswell as a friend of one worker, in putting $40 each toward thetickets.   She said all agreed they would split what winnings came from the``Quick Pick'' tickets. ``Quick Pick'' means that the numbers wereselected at random by one of the computerized lotto terminals.   The tickets were purchased at a Circle K convenience store, shesaid. Lottery officials verified that the winning ticket inFallbrook was purchased at a Circle K.   The hospital workers in the pool held a party to watch Saturdaynight's drawing.   ``The lady who found we had a winning ticket screamed,'' saidDragon. ``Everybody was just amazed. Then everybody starteddreaming about what we were going to do with the money.   ``I'm going to set up trust funds for my four kids and pay offbills,'' she said. ``But for Thanksgiving, we're all going to go toHawaii, or some place like that.''   She said the ticket was placed in a bank vault.   Lottery spokeswoman Susan Kossack said each winner will receive$20,296,175, a third of the $60,888,525 jackpot, in installmentsover 20 years. The installments will amount to $810,666 annuallyafter taxes, she said.   If verified, the hospital pool ticket would be worth more than$67,600 annually before taxes for 20 years to each of the 15people. The lottery pays out only to a single winner, the personholding the winning ticket. Arrangements for dividing the moneywould be the responsibility of the group.   Dragon said two hospital workers, Duff Stone and Charlie Jett,bought the tickets for the group. An unidentified woman whoanswered the telephone at Stone's home said reporters would have towait to talk to the winners at a lottery office on Monday.   The winning numbers selected in the televised Saturday nightdrawing were: 5, 20, 26, 28, 32, and 39. The bonus number was 3.   The jackpot was the world's largest lottery prize, according toTaylor.   The previous world record jackpot was $56 million in Spain's ElGordo lottery in 1983, according to Sam Valenza, publisher ofLottery Players magazine in Moorestown, N.J. But in Spain'slottery, players don't choose their numbers, which are alreadyprinted on tickets, and several winning entries are guaranteed ineach of the five or six drawings held each year.   The previous North American record was a $55.16 million jackpotin a Florida lottery last month. That prize went to a single winner.   Saturday's California drawing climaxed a week of frenzied lottoticket buying throughout the state, with gamblers wagering about$106 million, Taylor said.   ``All these figures are records,'' Kossack added.   Saturday's sales hit $39.5 million, officials said. At 6:32 p.m.Saturday, the high sales point, more than 86,000 tickets were beingsold each minute. In the heaviest hour, from 5 p.m. to 6 p.m.Saturday, about 4.3 million of the $1 tickets were sold.   The Saturday jackpot soared because on Wednesday, for the fourthconsecutive time, nobody picked the six winning numbers between 1and 49. Wednesday's $33.4 million jackpot was rolled over to theSaturday game and grew with each ticket sale.   Residents of Nevada, which has legalized gambling but no statelottery, accounted for some of the sales, officials said.   The busiest store Saturday was in the Sierra Nevada community ofTruckee, 20 miles southwest west of Reno, Nev., with sales of$47,652.   For the week, the busiest retailer was a store in Baker, 80miles southwest of Las Vegas, that has only one lotto salesterminal but logged $162,014 in sales.   Lottery tickets with five winning numbers plus the bonus numberwill pay $261,977 each to 29 players, while five numbers withoutthe bonus will pay $3,742 each to 1,046 players, said Taylor.</TEXT></DOC>
