 Whether it's ultimately seen as a boon or a bane dependsentirely on the uses to which we as a society allow it to be put.andP;  Notsurprisingly, these choices most often end up being dictated chiefly bycommercial considerations.andP;  Ordinarily, the law doesn't play a major roleuntil this fundamental decision-making process has gotten well under way.andO;Then the legal system, following its age-old role as the handmaiden ofcommerce, proceeds to legitimize and then protect these chosen applications,in the process making it difficult or impossible for the technology to beutilized in any other ways.andP;  As a result, we may find ourselves trapped in apattern that won't necessarily serve our long-term interests.andM;I've intended for some time to write about this subject.andP;  However, it took acatastrophe in my part of the world to prompt me to actually set out thesegloomy ruminations.andM;Although several weeks will have passed before readers see this column, as Iwrite it is barely a week since a major earthquake rolled through northernCalifornia.andP;  In one sense our information technology--which in this casemeans television and, to some extent, radio--served us satisfactorily indealing with this event; most of you learned of it a short time after itsoccurrence at 5:04 pm on October 17.andP;  But to judge from the nature of theanxious inquiries that poured into northern California once the overburdenedtelephone system here began to function somewhat normally again, the majorityof you appear to have been badly misled as a direct result of the way we havechosen to use the wonderful technology we call TV.andM;While it was touching to realize how many people cared--including some Ihadn't heard from in years--it soon I hadn't heard from in years--it soonbecame a bit tiresome having to explain over and over again that, in contrastto the impression they had received that the entire area was in ruins, thehouses for several miles surrounding me were still sitting primly upon theirfoundations (as nearly as I could tell), that the streets outside wereentirely free of rubble, and that evidently the majority of the 4.5 millionsouls residing around the shores of San Francisco Bay had suffered littlemore than a bad scare and the inconvenience of having to pick up the contentsof spilled shelves.andM;By the Sunday night following the temblor, I realized that I'd spentvirtually the entire weekend giving reassurances over the telephone.andP;  Withthe local newspapers again being able to resume publishing full editions, itbecame clear that my reaction was widely shared.andP;  A writer for the SanFrancisco Examiner quoted one harried resident as saying, &quot;It got to thepoint where I wanted to put on my answering machine, 'No, I'm not alive andwell.andP;  It's been nice knowing you.'&quot;andM;The culprits, as we gradually discovered, were the national televisionnetworks.andP;  The local stations, which by and large did a remarkable job underdifficult circumstances, at first largely preempted the national coverage, soit was the latter part of the week before most of us living here had muchopportunity to see what the rest of the world had been seeing.andP;  Residents ofareas including large portions of San Francisco itself, in which electricalpower was disrupted during the days immediately following the quake, wereable to see little if any television during this period.andM;Upon reflection, I realize that it should have been anticipated that networkTV would handle the affair in the way it did.andP;  There is a particular irony inthis, though.andP;  As had been the case with radio before it, television wasenvisioned by its inventors and developers primarily as a medium forenriching the human mind: learning and culture would no longer be thebirthright of a privileged minority, they thought, but would flow into everyhome.andP;  (Some visionaries even predicted that schools would be renderedredundant.)andM;For a while, the reality in at least some degree matched the expectations ofthe television pioneers.andP;  I remember watching a piano recital given by DameMyra Hess during prime time on NBC in the mid-'50s, and also seeing the liveperformances that were presented several times a year by the NBCOpera--including a historic Tosca with a young soprano named Leontyne Pricein the title role.andM;Inexorably, however, the insistent demands of commerce pushed networktelevision into becoming what we're familiar with today: a sophisticatedmechanism for huckstering things that people might not otherwise be moved topurchase.andP;  Attracting and holding the largest possible audience is central tothis function, of course, which explains why network TV focused on thoseaspects of the earthquake that it did.andM;The picturesque Marina district of San Francisco, with its backdrop of theGolden Gate and the stately Palace of Fine Arts, provided sensational shotsof burning and collapsed residences--and TV thrives on sensation.andP;  Of coursethe events in the Marina were heartbreaking--just about everyone around hereknows people who live there, and the personal tragedy extended even to thestaff of this magazine--but thre's nevertheless a disturbing aspect to thenetworks' decision to concentrate on this facet of the story.andP;  Overwhelminglywhite and quite obviously middle class, the dispossessed Marina residentswere just the sort of folks with whom Middle America, glued to its screensacross the country, could empathize.andP;  Largely unreported, as nearly as Icould tell, was the fact that far more housing units were rendereduninhabitable in the low-income, heavily Hispanic and black neighborhoodsdown around Market Street in San Francisco and in downtown Oakland.andM;Coverage of Oakland was in fact nearly exclusively confined to the collapseof the elevated Interstate 880 highway.andP;  This did provide a spectacularbackdrop before which the networks' prima donnas could step from theirstretch limos and demonstrate their vast ignorance of Bay Area place namesand geography.andP;  Later on, just as the networks' interest in the whole storyhad begun to wane, a survivor was pulled from the highway's ruin, and we wereback on familiar TV territory: it was the baby-rescued-from-the-well story inaltered guise.andP;  Although I fervently hope the rescued fellow recovers, I feltI neither needed nor wanted to know as much about him as the networksinsisted upon telling me at the expense of other earthquake coverage (i don'trecall them mentioning when he had his tonsils out, but that seemed about theonly possible omission).andM;In short, when the nation--and the world--needed basic information, TVprovided a circus.andP;  I thought it almost obscene that the Today cast wouldlounge in their circle of light on the Marina Green and exchange banalities,using the darkened setting for so much misery as their background.andP;  Overall,the networks' coverage of the earthquake had about the degree of fidelity asthe image produced by one of those distorting mirrors found in funhouses.andM;Well, television is what it is.andP;  To enrich the human mind it brings usGeraldo and The Young and the Restless, and it can't report a catastrophewithout turning it into tabloid journalism.andP;  However, as I implied earlier, alegal and regulatory framework has evolved that virtually precludes anyfundamental change in the broadcasting industry as it exists today.andP;  Insteadof following Herbert Hoover's noble concept of a broadcast license being apublic trust, the rules have changed in recent years so that stations havebecome mere commodities, to be bought and sold like hog futures.andP;  Now thereis no longer any requirement that a license holder actually operate thestation for a three-year period.andP;  And the astronomical &quot;sticker price&quot; forlicensed transmitters in major marrets makes it almost impossible forpurchasers to run a station profitably and service the leveraged debt apurchase usually entails without resorting to a format that offers thepossibility of snaring a mass audience.andM;The computing industry has not lacked visionaries either, as most readers areaware.andP;  I remain skeptical of predictions that envision the computer as theheart of every home--doing everything from assisting the children with theirhomework to controlling the furnace and providing the family with multimediaentertainment--for a number of reasons, but I'll limit myself to pointing outa couple of the most troublesome aspects of the legal straitjacket theindustry may find itself in.andM;A certain naivete permeated the world of computers during its early years.andO;Free access to information--not excluding code--was its sine qua non.andO;Obviously that's already changed to a great extent, but now we faceincreasing restraints on full utilization of the potential for informationexchange and retrieval that computers can provide.andM;One of these restraints arises from our growing concern over privacy.andP;  In theearly days of punch-cards and perforated tape, most people's resentment ofcomputers centered around the perception that errors, once in the system,seemed frustratingly impossible to correct.andP;  (If the computer got Joe mightas well resign himself to being known as Smuth for the rest of his life.)andO;Those irritations are largely behind us, but now resentment has surfacedagain, this time coming from a different quarter.andP;  There's a growingapprehension that computers are getting entirely too good at ferreting outand regurgitating information about us that's properly nobody else'sbusiness.andM;This concern was aired recently in a widely discussed article in BusinessWeek (September 4, 1989).andP;  The story's impact was heightened by thedisclosure that the reporter researching the piece had encountered littledifficulty obtaining intimate details regarding the President's finances.andO;But there are clearly many entities in this country--including the federalgovernment--that badly want to be able to obtain this sort of information,and they are not without influence in Congress.andP;  Whether meaningfulrestrictions on the flow of database information emerge or not, there'salmost certain to be some sort of regulation in the future, and its effectswill be difficult to foresee.andM;For some time, a major barrier to the free flow of ideas has been thederivative-work dilemma.andP;  Even so, I can still expect during the course of aseminar to be asked whether it's all right to take a bit of code from thissource and a bit from that, using them as the basis for a &quot;new&quot; program thatcan then be marketed.andP;  The answer, of course, is that unless all of the codeutilized is in the public domain, this can't be done legally unless theappropriate licenses have been obtained.andP;  Obviously, this is not the answerthe questioner wants to hear, and the general response indicates that thissort of practice is a lot more widespread than is generally acknowledged.andM;In the future, however, the derivative-work limitation promises to beespecially vexing in the process of creating the multimedia presentations nowcontemplated by a number of software developers.andP;  You think you can simplyput an ad in the classifieds and come up with somebody who can write musicthat anyone's going to want to listen to?andP;  Good luck.andP;  Moreover, you'relikely to find it a big pain clearing the rights to use any existing music,and the same applies to visual images.andP;  Frequently these rights arecontrolled by the estates of people long since dead, and the owners may havelittle interest in licensing the work for your trifling little project.andM;All this illustrates that just because we now have technology that makes itpossible to do something, it won't necessarily be legally feasible.andP;  By wayof an example, I was listening the other evening to a reissued operarecording featuring a great--and now, alas, deceased--soprano.andP;  The digitaltransfer is great, but the recording nevertheless is marred because the tenoris, well, less than first-rate.andP;  There happens to exist another recording ofthe same opera with a superb tenor in that role, and I'm assured byknowledgeable friends that digital technology would enable this gentleman'svoice to be substituted for the disappointing one; they say even the temposcan be matched without affecting the pitch.andP;  It'd be expensive, of course,but that's no matter, because it can't legally be done.andP;  The contracts theartists made with their respective companies simply don't allow for this sortof thing.andM;To this mix of headaches let us add the growing legislative pressure put oncompanies to do something about computer crackers and about creeps who sneakviruses, worms, or whatever into software; and then top it off with theefforts being made by some companies to carve out formats and perhaps wholeenvironments as their private property; and you have a lot of existing andpotential restraints on the once unfettered utilization of computertechnology.andP;  The decisions that are being made in all of these areas aregoing to determine the future course of innovations in the computingindustry, without doubt.andP;  And once the rules finally have been hammered out,they will be extremely difficult to change.andP;  Perhaps, like television,computing will find itself stuck in a mold from which it can't escape even ifit wished to.andM;Do you get the feeling that the fun days are about over?andM;Glenn Groenewold is a California attorney who devotes his time to writing andlecturing on computer law.andP;  He also has served as an administrative lawjudge.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
