Samples were collected fromthe crest of Red Dome in Montana where the Chugwater is saturated withhydrocarbons and bleached around fractures. The fractures, which formedduring Laramide deformation, provided conduits for oil migration. Themagnetization in the unaltered red beds resides in hematite. The magnetizationin the oil saturated sandstones, however, resides in magnetite, althoughthe magnetic intensity is at least an order of magnitude less than thatobserved in the red beds. The bleached samples possess intermediate magneticcharacteristics and contain abundant authigenic specular hematite. Althougha magnetic direction could not be isolated from the hydrocarbon-saturatedsandstones, the bleached samples contain an early Tertiary magnetizationthat resides in authigenic hematite. The magnetite found in the hydrocarbon-saturatedsandstones is probably a combination of detrital and authigenic magnetite.The results of this study, particularly the intensity differences betweenthe unaltered and hydrocarbon-saturated red beds, also have importantimplications for aeromagnetic hydrocarbon exploration.</TEXT></DOC>
