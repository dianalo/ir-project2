SUAREZ</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The resignation of a top official,charges of corruption and internal squabbling are hampering effortsto recover billions of dollars that Ferdinand Marcos allegedlystole during his 20 years in office.   There are even calls for scuttling the Presidential Commissionon Good Government, or PCGG, which President Corazon Aquino createdtwo years ago to recover up to $10 billion in assets that Marcosand his associates are accused of taking.   The commission is fighting for control of bank accounts, stockand real estate scattered throughout the United States, Europe andAsia, including about $350 million in New York real estate.   But so far, the commission says it has gained control of only$300 million in various assets in the Philippines. All but $60million worth are subject to lengthy litigation.   One commission member, Jose Laureta, told reporters that at thecurrent pace, it might take 100 years to retrieve the money ``ifwe're lucky.''   ``If we're unlucky, 300 years,'' he added.   ``Only Marcos and (his wife Imelda) are laughing ...,'' wrotecolumnist Vicente Albano Pacis in the Philippine Daily Inquirer.``The present difficulties of the PCGG must have been the firstgood news the Marcoses have received since they arrived in Hawaii.''   The Marcoses have lived in exile there since his ouster from thepresidency in February 1986.   The crisis in the five-member commission reached a climaxTuesday when Mrs. Aquino announced the resignation of its chairman,Ramon Diaz.   Diaz, a former insurance executive with an untarnishedreputation for personal honesty, quit in disgust afterSolicitor-General Francisco Chavez accused the commission ofincompetence and a ``trail of corruption.''   Chavez made his accusation in the wake of a graft charge againstcommission member Quintin Doromal, who allegedly used his influenceto win a government contract for a firm owned by his family.   Doromal, who denied the charge, is to be arraigned before ananti-graft court early next month.   Diaz said in a letter to his staff that he resented being``toyed around.'' He also claimed that relatives of unnamed``powers that be'' interfered with the commission to free assetsseized by the commission.   Diaz's replacement, Adolfo Azcuna, already has come under firebecause he was a partner in a law firm once retained by BenjaminRomualdez, younger brother of Marcos' wife, Imelda, and formerambassador to the United States during his brother-in-law'sadministration.   Romualdez's assets were among those seized by the commission.   Following Diaz's resignation, Mrs. Aquino ordered an audit ofall assets taken over by the commission. They range frombusinesses, stock, real estate, bank deposits, planes, automobilesand jewelry. Some of the last three have allegedly disappeared.   Members of the House of Representatives have called for aseparate probe. Speaker Ramon Mitra said the House is to debateseveral bills calling for scuttling the commission or curbing itspowers.   The commission has long been accused of corruption in thehandling of companies or shares of stock seized on suspicion theywere illegally acquired by the Marcoses or their associates.   The commission was responsible not only for tracking down andidentifying companies controlled by Marcos and his associates butalso with administering them. Critics say that has given corruptofficials the opportunity to rake off corporate funds.   Commission officials have acknowledged corruption among some ofthe commission's 200 ``fiscal agents'' and have filed chargesagainst six of them. In one case, members of a company board ofdirectors appointed by the commission allegedly voted themselvescar loans using corporate funds. Another case involves thedisappearance of hundreds of head of cattle from a sequesteredranch.   The current crisis complicates what was already an awesome taskof unraveling a web of dummy companies, laundered funds and aliasesallegedly used by Marcos and his associates to loot the treasury.   Newspaper columnist Belinda Cunanan described the corruptioncharges against the commission as exaggerated. But she acknowledgedits reputation had been so tarnished it deserves a ``mercykilling.''   ``Motives aside, I think Congress should really abolish the PCGGat this stage,'' Mrs. Cunanan said. ``The exit of Ramon Diaz andhis replacement, even on a temporary capacity, by presidentiallegal adviser Adolfo Azcuna ... just about shattered whatevercredibility is left of the PCGG.''</TEXT></DOC>
