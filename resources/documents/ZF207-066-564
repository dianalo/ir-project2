 A manual system is still a system.andO;Sometimes it's the best system.andM;For example, a few years ago a state corporation commissioner asked a systemsanalyst to look over the filing system, with an eye towards automating it.andO;The office clearly needed help: It took too long to find documents, andsometimes they couldn't be found at all.andM;When he completed his work, the analyst made four recommendations: narrow theaisle from 6 feet to 4 feet (increasing the amount of file cabinet space byone-third), move three people into offices with doors (the location of theirdesks in a large room lowered their productivity), reorganize the manualfiling system to prevent document loss and speed document retrieval, and waitthree years before attempting any automation.andM;The analyst's refreshing approach considers a solution other than immediateautomation.andP;  The improved manual system stabilized during the next threeyears.andP;  In that time, the state corporation commissioner vastly improveddelivery of service.andP;  As the analyst predicted, technology improvedsufficiently to allow a smooth transition into computerization.andP;  The systemnow serves as a model for government offices around the country.andM;It should also serve as a model for micro managers.andP;  Had the analystsuccumbed to the temptation to automate filing and indexing three years toosoon, he would almost certainly have run afoul of a maxim beloved of officeautomation consultant Amy Wohl: ''If you automate a mess, you end up with anautomated mess.''andM;The fastest way to improve the results of any computerization process isfirst to improve the manual process on which it is based.andM;Suppose you consider sticking with the manual system, but conclude that anautomated system would be an improvement.andM;You still face some serious management questions about proper investment ofyour time.andP;  For example, one micro manager recently told me, ''We spent 100hours on a DBMS interface that is only used once a week by one person.andP;  Thevice president asked for it, so we did it.''andM;In his own mind, the micro manager questioned the value of spending that muchtime on a single project.andP;  He did not, however, question the vice president'sorder (a future column will deal with vice presidents overriding yourprocedures).andM;Is this an example of overautomation?andP;  Should this DBMS search have been leftas a semimanual task?andP;  As it turns out, there isn't enough informationprovided to answer the question.andM;On the face of it, the development effort appears to be gigantic for a weeklyDBMS search.andP;  But what the micro manager here didn't ask -- what micromanagers often fail to ask -- was what that activity is worth to thecorporation.andM;If it brings in $1 million in revenue, or significantly decreases the chancesof a painful million-dollar lawsuit, it is worth 100 hours and more toautomate the task.andP;  Ask if automation of this task improves speed (and speedmatters) or accuracy (which always matters somewhat).andM;In short, the second micro manager focused on the costs (which he could see)and ignored the benefits (visible only to others).andP;  It is a common enoughmistake, but it is also the kind of thing that can stand in the way ofpromotion and positive job performance evaluations.andP;  The road to seniormanagement lies in a recognition of cost/benefit ratios for the entireorganization, not for a single entity.andP;  Performing some task may cost yourmicro operation a lot of time and money.andP;  If the corporate benefits exceedthose costs, it is time and money well spent -- especially if you gently yetfrequently remind senior management of the benefits.andM;On the other hand, the search may be nothing more than the personal whim ofthe vice president.andP;  In that case, you can resist an unreasonable request bycouching the discussion in business terms.andP;  Don't whine about the 100 hoursyou spend developing the program.andP;  Point out the costs involved, the otherprojects being postponed, and ask the customer to quantify the benefits.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
