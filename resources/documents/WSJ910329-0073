Alexander Dunaev, chairman of Glavkosmos, the SovietUnion's commercial space agency, told a small group of U.S.aerospace executives here that his agency planned to launchas many as four 18-ton satellites beginning in 1994 using itshuge Energia rocket. If the plan goes forward, the satelliteswould be about five times as big as any ever launched intogeosynchronous orbit, 22,300 miles above Earth. At thatorbital height, the satellite appears stationary from Earth.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Dunaev also said that his agency would soon beginselling commercial radar images of Earth taken by the Almazsatellite, due to be launched this weekend in the SovietUnion. Space-borne radars can see through clouds and at nightand are much valued by reconnaissance agencies. Indeed, theonly U.S. radar satellites orbiting the Earth are spysatellites, called Lacrosse, which were used for intelligencegathering during the Persian Gulf war.   &quot;Our goal is to expand our space industry and establishpatterns of cooperation&quot; with the U.S., Mr. Dunaev saidthrough an interpreter in an interview after the two-daymeeting.   The goal, of course, is also to earn hard currency andexpand the Soviet Union's minuscule share of theinternational market for space launches and services.Glavkosmos's search for Western cash is so pressing that theagency even plans to try to sell its full-scale model of theMir space station after it uses the model at the Paris AirShow in June.   The Soviet's boldest plan is to try to build and launch agargantuan direct-broadcast TV system. According to Mr.Dunaev and his aides, each of the satellites would havesufficient room and power to relay TV, telephones and otherforms of telecommunications. He said his agency is workingwith German companies, which he wouldn't name, to design,build and finance the satellites. Three of the satelliteswould cover the huge land mass of the Soviet Union; a fourthwould be required for global coverage.   The satellites would beam television signals to satellitedishes, roughly 1 1/2 feet in diameter at homes and apartmenthouses in the Soviet Union. &quot;We're developing the systemconcept with the Germans,&quot; he said. &quot;If organizations in theU.S. are interested, we'd be happy to talk with them.&quot;   Edward Crawley, director of the space engineering researchcenter at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, whoorganized the meeting, said that the Soviets were capable ofbuilding and launching huge satellites but that they wouldneed Western help to design the sophisticated electronicsrequired on board and on the ground. With its antiquatedtelecommunications system, the Soviet Union would seem to bea natural market for a spaceborne system. But Mr. Crawleycautioned that &quot;the question is whether you can create acommunications infrastructure in space that's cheaper thanone on land.&quot;   Glavkosmos said it had formed a marketing agreement withprivately held Space Commerce Corp. of Houston to marketradar images of Earth, where the finest detail is about 20meters. The orbital path of the Almaz radar satellite --Russian for &quot;diamond&quot; -- will take it directly over the U.S.,Mr. Dunaev said. Remote photos of Earth are used byscientists studying geology and climate and by companiesprospecting for minerals and forecasting crops.   &quot;The Almaz has better resolution than the Lacrosse,&quot; Mr.Dunaev bragged, referring to the U.S. spy satellite. Then hebacked off, saying, &quot;Well, I think it does, but they don'tmake photographs available to us.&quot;   Mr. Dunaev, a burly man with silver-gray hair, has workedin the Soviet space program since the days of Sputnik, firstdesigning spacecraft to travel to the Moon and Mars. He saidthis was his first trip to the U.S., and he complainedbitterly about U.S. space policy. Late last year, the U.S.tried to restrict sharply the Soviet Union's commercial spacelaunch business by limiting it to a proposed space port inAustralia.   &quot;We can't agree to conditions dictated by Washington,&quot; hesaid. &quot;We laugh. We say we want free trade, and this isprotectionism.&quot;   But Mr. Crawley said that even if Washington liberalizedits policy, the Soviet Union would still face a tough timemarketing its space wares because of the huge gap in businesspractices between the West and the Soviet Union. During themeeting, for instance, the Soviet representatives didn't handout any detailed literature about its proposals althoughthere were a number of potential customers and partnerssitting across the table.   At home, Mr. Dunaev and other space officials face fardifferent challenges. With the political liberalization inthe Soviet Union, the Soviet space program has come underheated criticism for wasting valuable funds during a time ofeconomic crisis. In addition, Glavkosmos must steer a pathbetween the demands of the Soviet state and the increasinglyassertive republics.   The Russian republic has ordered three communicationssatellites from Glavkosmos recently, Mr. Dunaev said, andKazakhstan is negotiating for its own direct-broadcastsatellite. &quot;If there are economic problems, the satelliteswon't get launched,&quot; Mr. Duanev worries. &quot;So we ask for moneyup front.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
