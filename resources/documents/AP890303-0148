In South Florida, home region of the Miami-based carrier, allthree regional airports began planning days ahead of the Machinists'strike deadline at 12:01 a.m. Saturday how to keep operationsrunning smoothly.   In St. Paul, Minn., a federal judge issued an order barringNorthwest Airlines' 21,000-member Machinists' union from staging asympathy strike in the event of a walkout.   U.S. District Judge Paul Magnuson said his temporary restrainingorder ``is in the best interests of the public'' to avoid disruptingflights.   The order, which had been sought by the Eagan-based airline,remains in effect until a March 13 hearing on whether to grantNorthwest's request for a preliminary injunction against the union.   Guy Cook, chairman of the Machinists' local at Northwest, calledMagnuson's ruling ``another nail in the coffin of labor people.''   At Miami International Airport, adjacent to Eastern's corporateheadquarters, extensive preparations have been made ``to maintainthe airport operating and protect the public's right of access tothe airport,'' according to Dade County Aviation Departmentspokeswoman Amalia Fernandez.   There will be heavy weekend staffing, strictly designatedpicketing areas, extra tow trucks to keep ramps and roads clear, andadditional Metro-Dade police officers on duty throughout thesprawling facility, Ms. Fernandez said.   Additional staff will be assigned to airport terminals to helpstranded or delayed passengers, she said.   On Thursday, a caravan of about 2,000 Machinists slowly drovevehicles past the Miami airport terminal, causing a massive trafficjam that angered airline passengers. Similar protests were held inseveral other cities, including Newark, N.J.   At Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport north ofMiami, Broward County Sheriff's Lt. Jack Greeney, Executive Officeof the department's airport division, said he plans to doubleairport deputy patrols Friday night.   Greeney said he has been in touch with both the local Machinists'union and Eastern management to seek cooperation in keeping headscool in the event of a strike.   ``We've informed both of them we're not going to tolerate anyacts of violence from anyone,'' Greeney said.   At Palm Beach International Airport, operations spokesman JerryAllen, like his counterparts at several other Eastern-linkedairports around the country, spent Thursday meeting with police andcity officials for strike preparations.   Additional security arrangements also were established atairports in Atlanta, Washington, Newark, Seattle and Philadelphia.   In both Washington and Newark, officials expressed additionalconcern over possible rail strikes in solidarity with Eastern'smachinists.   In the New York area, commuter railroads are expecting to be hitby a secondary strike if the Machinists walk out as threatened.   The Long Island Rail Road, which has about 135,000 daily riders,and the Metro-North Commuter Railroad, which carries 95,000 dailycommuters, both are vulnerable, along with New Jersey Transit andfreight railroads.   In Washington, the head of Amtrak said the national passengerrailroad would continue limited operations for only a few days ifpicketed by workers supporting any strike against Eastern.   W. Graham Claytor Jr., president of Amtrak, also said that ifEastern is struck and sympathetic workers do not picket therailroad, Amtrak would add trains between New York and Washingtonand possibly between New York and Boston.   Amtrak spokesman R. Clifford Black in Washington said a strike inthe area by rail workers would affect 5,000 commuters who traveldaily by train into and out of the capital.</TEXT></DOC>
