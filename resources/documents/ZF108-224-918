 The telephone hasallowed us to interact with each other since day one.andP;  But when we talk aboutan interactive technology (there are many) we are usually talking about aninteraction between a human being (or several human beings) and a machine.andM;Interactive technology encompasses wave-of-the-future stuff like interactivevideo games that let you play your favorite game against a friend hundreds ofmiles away and interactive television that lets you be a contestant on yourfavorite game show or shoot the bad guy in a cops-and-robbers show.andP;  It alsoincludes more workaday applications in audiotex and videotext.andM;&quot;What all of these things have in common is telecommunications,&quot; says BruceKushnick of Strategic Telemedia, an audiotex consulting and publishing firm.andO;Whether the medium is the traditional telephone network or coaxial or fiberoptic cable television lines, it all comes down to telecommunications.andM;VideotextandM;Videotext is a two-way interactive electronic data transmission orinformation retrieval system that (usually) uses the telephone network.andP;  Themost famous example of a videotext service is probably France's Minitel.andM;Videotext is serious business.andP;  It seems to attract a gray-suit crowd.andP;  Thatmay be because, in the US at least, newspapers, banks and telephone companieshave been the major players in videotext.andM;Gary Arlen, president of Arlen Communications and publisher of theInteractivity Report, says that there have been three major efforts to makevideotext work in the US, but all have failed or are failing.andM;First newspapers gave it a shot (with on-line versions of their papers).andO;Next were the at-home banking programs that required users to have their ownPC.andP;  They let customers do some electronic banking at home at any hour.andO;These met with varying degrees of success.andP;  But most of these bankingprograms are gone or on the way out now.andM;The third try is the current effort being made by the Bell companies.andP;  Arlendoes not predict success for their present efforts either.andM;So who will lead the fourth and successful effort to bring videotext to themasses?andP;  &quot;The phone companies again,&quot; he predicts.andP;  &quot;This time they'll do itright.&quot;andM;One name that pops up in any discussion of videotext is Prodigy Services.andO;Arlen describes them as &quot;The Great White Plains Hope.&quot;andM;The Prodigy Services Company is the result of a partnership between Sears andIBM.andP;  It's located near one of its parent companies -- in White Plains, NY.andM;Prodigy works a little differently than most videotext services.andP;  First, itcharges one monthly fee, $9.95, regardless of how often it is used.andP;  Mostvideotext services bill by the amount of time the customer is connected tothe system.andM;Prodigy keeps costs low by supplementing their services with advertising --users can ignore it (like a TV commercial) or get more information about theproduct advertised by pushing a button.andM;Next, the bulk of the computer processing is done using the Prodigy softwareat the customer's home computer.andP;  Only a small amount of information travelsback and forth between the user and the Prodigy site.andP;  Most videotextservices virtually turn the user's computer into a terminal of the videotexthost computer.andP;  The Prodigy service is available to both PC-compatible andMacintosh computer users.andM;The Prodigy offerings are family oriented, ranging from shopping, travelservices and brokerage stuff to electronic mail and bulletin boards toexperts' columns and entertainment.andM;AudiotexandM;By now, we are all familiar with audiotex services -- even interactiveaudiotex services.andP;  Instead of just playing a recorded message, interactiveaudiotex (like horoscope 900 numbers) lets callers pick a topic they wouldlike more information about (to choose the day's horoscope for Gemini alone,rather than listening to all 12 horoscopes) or give information via thetouchtone keypad or recorded message.andM;Interactive 900 services are a form of interactive audiotex.andP;  With 900services the caller pays for the call.andP;  It's usually a flat fee (per minuteor per call) from anywhere in the US.andP;  The charge appears on the caller'sphone bill.andM;While using 900 services and audiotex for entertainment is hot, the move ininteractive 900 services seems to be away from entertainment and towardentertaining promotions.andM;Interactive TeleMedia is a 900 services company with a vision of the futureof 900 services that matches the predictions of industry experts.andM;Kayes Ahmed, president of Interactive TeleMedia, feels there is going to be ashake out in the 900 services industry, but he feels his company will be oneof the lucky survivors because of their vision of the future of 900 services.andM;Right now, says Ahmed, many service providers are going for the quick buck,providing &quot;hopes, jokes and 'scopes&quot; for the masses with little thought tobuilding a customer base or the future of the industry.andM;Interactive TeleMedia is not in entertainment, although they try to make themarketing and promotion pieces they do entertaining.andP;  They try to keep thecosts of the calls low (which makes sense since these are promotionalpieces).andP;  They don't market to children and they don't do any &quot;adult&quot;services.andM;They have proprietary software built into their system that blocks peoplefrom making more than four calls a week from the same phone number, and theyare working on even tighter controls.andM;&quot;We really have two customers,&quot; says Ahmed.andP;  &quot;The first is our client.andP;  Thecompany that hires us to put together a promotion for them.andP;  The second isthe caller to the 900 number.andP;  Our (corporate) clients are concerned abouttheir reputations and in building a good image through the 900 number.&quot;andM;Interactive TeleMedia's clients include 7-Up, Paramount Pictures, Visa andUnivision, one of the largest Spanish-language television networks in the US.andO;Callers are drawn to promotions run by these companies by sweepstakes andmessages from celebrities.andM;In a promotion for one of Univision's Spanish-language soap-operas, callerslisten to &quot;Carmita,&quot; a fictional fellow fan created by Interactive TeleMedia,dish the latest gossip on the show's characters.andP;  The promotion was sosuccessful that Univision wrote Carmita into the script of the soap opera.andM;Future VisionandM;The really juicy interactive technologies -- like interactive television --will depend on some advances in technology.andP;  People who are developinginteractive technologies are depending on ISDN, High Definition Television,fiber optic cabling to the home and the popularization of CD-ROM (Read-onlymemory on a compact disk).andM;At a recent conference on interactivity a panel was put together to discuss&quot;Future Visions of Interactive Entertainment.&quot;andP;  Although the backgrounds ofthe panel members were as diverse as special effects for films, museumdevelopment and videodisk publishing, their vision was unanimous: technologyis not enough.andM;ISDN and High Definition Television may be eagerly anticipated tools forinteractive media, they said, but interactivity in itself has no intrinsicvalue.andM;In other words, the interactive media, whether it's television, videotext oraudiotex, needs not only to have programming that will attract users (aproblem videotext is having), but it needs to provide quality programmingthat will keep the users it attracts (as with interactive 900 services).andM;Red Burns of NYU, the panel moderator, pointed out that the ultimateinteractive device is still the telephone.andP;  It's a simple technology, but ithas kept us interacting for over a hundred years.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
