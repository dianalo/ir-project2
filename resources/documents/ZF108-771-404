Department of Justice.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Eagle Update: Rash of Hiring Soaks Up PCs.andM;A rash of new hires because of savings and loan prosecutions and recentanticrime legislation have helped to upset early estimates of equipmentorders under the Justice Department's ADP contract known as Project Eagle.andM;Justice's Criminal Division is soaking up new PC word processing and localarea network equipment faster than anyone in the Project Eagle officeanticipated.andM;&quot;We were parched,&quot; said Michael C. Olmsted, special counsel to the assistantattorney general in charge of the Criminal Division.andM;The Criminal Division alone has 87 more lawyers than it had when the EagleSteering Committee set up its schedule for ordering PCs, and it has 100 newlawyer slots to fill.andP;  &quot;There's more corruption,&quot; Olmsted said, and thatrequires &quot;more bodies, because we're processing those cases.&quot;andM;No more than six months ago, Criminal Division lawyers were preparing theircases using typewriters and old IBM Corp. Display Writer word processors, andthere never were enough to go around, Olmsted said.andM;&quot;You waited your turn, or you bullied your way on, whatever it took to get toa word processor,&quot; he said.andM;Since then every office in the Criminal Division has been wired withtwisted-pair data lines, and 95 percent of the PCs for the division have beendelivered, said Joseph R. Lake, acting MIS director for the Criminal Divisionand a member of the working group that processes purchase orders under Eagle.andM;The Criminal Division was high on the list to receive Eagle equipment becauseit was sorely needed, Justice officials said.andM;During the eight-year contract with Tisoft Inc., Fairfax, Va., orders fornetworked PCs for the Criminal Divisions, Tax Division and Executive Officeof U.S.andP;  Attorneys may add up to 12,000.andM;Under the Eagle contract, Tisoft is shipping 386SX and 386 PCs that plug intomodular wall jacks.andP;  Each twisted-pair wiring connection goes throughpunch-down blocks in wiring closets to wiring hubs made by SynopticsCommunications Inc., Mountain View, Calif.andM;Fiber-optic or twisted-pair cabling from the Synoptics hubs to minicomputerswith LAN controller cards completes the physical connection between the PCsand minicomputer servers.andM;Users can save data files simultaneously to both their local hard drives andto the network servers because of a piece of software one Justice officialcalled &quot;Tisoft magic.&quot;andM;In addition, Justice employees have the option of copying sensitive data totheir local PC's hard or floppy drive, bypassing the network altogether, saidMark Miller, deputy director of the Eagle Project Office in Washington.andM;An important part of Tisoft's communications plan for Eagle is Tisoft'scustom-made Distributed Processing Network operating system for PCs hooked toData General Corp. minis.andM;For communication between minis, Eagle uses Data General's X.25server-to-server communications software called Xodiac.andP;  TCP/IP software letsthe PCs communicate with the minis via Ethernet.andM;The key difference between Eagle and AMICUS, the Justice Department's prevousoffice automation effort, is the PC, Miller said.andP;  &quot;Resources on the DataGeneral are now free to do other things,&quot; he said, such as run Oracle 6.0,the database from Oracle Corp.andM;The PCs, with 40M hard drives, are IBM compatibles made by Wyse Technology ofSan Jose, Calif.andM;Justice employees access WordPerfect Office Mail, Calendar and Schedulersoftware through terminal controller cards.andP;  A single Data General controllercard can allow as many as 128 simultaneous sessions between the PC and theserver, Miller said.andM;The same terminal controller cards also drive the networked printers, Millersaid.andP;  Lawyers print their documents on high-speed Hewlett-Packard Co.andO;LaserJet II and LaserJet 2000 printers hooked to the network's asynchronousservers.andM;The network's asynchronous modern servers give Justice lawyers 2,400-bit/secdial-in access to the Eagle LAN while they are traveling with laptopcomputers or while at home, Miller said.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
