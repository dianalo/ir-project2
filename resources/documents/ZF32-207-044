(NSA), and Rumba fromWall Data Inc.andP;  A mere tenth of a point separated the top finisher from thethird-placed product.andM;All three products proved to be viable candidates with individual strengthsand weaknesses.andP;  As these products have matured since the release of Windows3.0, they have become effective and easy-to-use tools that offer users a hostof functions while shielding them from the complexities inherent intraditional character-based 3270 emulators.andM;During the week of Jan.andP;  21, PC Week Labs staff, corporate judges and fiveemulator vendors gathered at the main campus of Fox Valley Technical College(FVTC) in Appleton, Wis.andP;  At the time, FVTC, a PC Week Virtual Lab site, waspreparing to select a 3270 Windows emulator (see story, Page S/34).andM;On Monday, the IBM, Wall Data and Future Soft/NSA teams were given 13 and ahalf hours (8 a.m.andP;  to 9:30 p.m.) to install their software on three systemseach and to develop a number of customized &quot;applications&quot; intended to showoff the features and capabilities of their products (see Testing Methodology,Page S/33).andP;  Judging for these three vendors took place on Tuesday duringthree two-hour blocks in which each vendor demonstrated its products andcustomized solutions.andP;  Attachmate and Eicon Technology worked on their setupand solution development on Wednesday and were judged on Thursday.andM;In addition to their customized solutions, vendors were encouraged todemonstrate any functions of their product that they believed were important.andM;The motto of the Shoot-Out was, &quot;Don't tell us what your product can do.andO;Show us!&quot;andM;One of the benefits of the Shoot-Out format was the chance to watch thevendor teams experience and adapt to the typical real-world problems thatcrop up in any micro-mainframe environment.andP;  These included Logical Unitsthat repeatedly failed to automatically restart and had to be manuallyactivated by FVTC systems staff, as well as the unexpected crashes of theCustomer Information Control System (CICS) system.andM;Certainly not typical was a bomb threat that the college received onWednesday, which forced an evacuation and four-hour closing.andP;  To ensure equaldevelopment time for all of the participating vendors, Attachmate and EiconTechnology were given an additional four hours on Thursday morning tocomplete their development; the judging was moved forward accordingly.andM;Seven corporate judges participated in the Shoot-Out: Paul Bandrowski of SaraLee Corp., Howard Mezera of Oshkosh Truck Corp., Linda Noack of AppletonPapers Inc., Scott Sablich of Kimberly-Clark Corp., Jim Smith of John DeereCo., and the Computer Services team from FVTC comprising Judy Brown and JerryWolf.andP;  Each was familiar with 3270 emulator technology and played a role inthe selection of technology at his or her organization.andM;On Tuesday morning, prior to the first judging session, the judges werebriefed on the format of the Shoot-Out, the application solution developmentcompleted by the vendors and suggested criteria on which to judge.andP;  Thejudges had a six-page scoring sheet for each product.andP;  The products wereranked, from excellent to poor, in four areas: ease of use; quality of theuser interface; quality of the integration into the Windows environment; and3270 emulation and application features.andM;A fifth area, performance, was ranked based on the results of the PC WeekLabs staff's upload and download timing tests (see benchmark chart, PageS/27).andM;Performance ultimately determined the winner.andP;  Thanks to its speedy filetransfers, the fastest of all those tested, Extra for Windows from Attachmateslid past DynaComm/Elite and Rumba to win the Shoot-Out.andP;  Attachmateattributes its product's speed to attention to 3270 basics and coding inassembler language rather than C.andM;In addition to speedy file transfer, Extra provides support for transfer toDISOSS and displays a window showing the status of the file transfer.andO;However, wild cards are not supported in the file-transfer dialogues, and thehost file list is not shown when the PC is receiving files from the host.andM;DynaComm/Elite turned in the next-to-slowest file-transfer times and wasperceived by the judges as being slow in operation.andP;  This proved the decidingfactor because, based solely on the judges' feedback on other criteria,DynaComm/Elite led the pack.andM;One judge said, &quot;This is the most technical product we've seen.andP;  It has allthe tools needed in an applications-development environment.andP;  It supports allthe basic functions, but seems to have developed each one a little deeperthan the other vendors.&quot;andM;DynaComm/Elite contains a powerful macro and scripting facility that allowsfor development of sophisticated automated applications.andP;  The scriptinglanguage contains more than 300 commands and 128 named variables, supportsinteger and floating-point math and user-defined dialog boxes.andM;In its demo, Future Soft/NSA used DynaComm/Elite's scripting facility to showautomated transfer of data from CICS to Microsoft Excel as well as automatingfunctions in FVTC's PROFS system.andP;  Included in the PROFS demo was anautomated log-on to VM with a pop-up window for user entry of the password, afunction of the scripting language.andM;Wall Data's Rumba came in just three-hundredths of a point behindDynaComm/Elite in its overall score, a virtual tie.andP;  The product in fact didtie with Future Soft/NSA's as the easiest to use.andM;Rumba's ease of use started with the simple installation.andP;  Afterinstallation, the user runs a fast-path option to establish the initialconnection with the mainframe.andP;  In addition, a running demo provides anon-line tutorial; the tutorial does not require an active mainframeconnection.andP;  The emulation program also provides extensive context-sensitiveon-line help, that uses the Windows help engine.andP;  In fact, the product comeswith no hard-copy documentation; it is all on-line.andP;  The judges' reaction tothis was mixed.andP;  While all praised Rumba's on-line tutorial, some believedthat the lack of written documentation was a weakness.andM;Color settings and keyboard remapping are available from the menu bar.andO;Session profiles, once they are customized, can be saved under aprogram-group icon.andM;Rumba also supports dynamic font resizing, fonts as small as two point, hotspots for PF keys and macros, and a Quickstep pad.andP;  This feature provides agrid ranging from two by four keys to six by eight keys, consisting of keysfor 3270 functions, macros, applications and PF keys.andM;Hot spots (text areas of the screen that can be clicked on with a mouse) canbe displayed on the screen or hidden.andP;  And automatic log-on macros can promptthe user for the password.andM;The judges found Attachmate's Extra next on the ease-of-use list.andP;  Theproduct's on-screen keypad, called a Smartpad, can hold an unlimited numberof keys representing 3270 functions, PF keys and Extra macros.andP;  The Smartpadcan be resized and reshaped with ease, and a different Smartpad can be set upfor each session.andP;  Hot spots are supported only for PF keys and only whenthey appear on-screen in the format PFnn.andP;  Macros for Extra can issue apop-up dialog box and query for interactive data.andM;Although keys can be remapped, a graphical keyboard remapper is a sorelyneeded feature, according to several of the judges.andP;  Screen colors can bechanged in a separate configuration module rather than from within theemulator program.andP;  Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) is fully supported, andprinting is handled through the Windows Print Manager.andM;Attachmate demonstrated Excel and Microsoft Word macros that logged onto thehost and initiated transfer of data through DDE, eliciting solid praise fromthe judges.andP;  In addition, they demonstrated a PROFS interface that includesan icon to indicate that a user has mail waiting as well as pull-down menuselections for most PROFS functions.andP;  Clicking on the mail-waiting icon withthe mouse brings the user into the PROFS Open the Mail screen.andP;  The PROFSinterface is available as an add-in product from Attachmate's SPIFapplications-development group at no charge.andM;Extra also contains strong font support, which the Attachmate teamdemonstrated by resizing a 3270 session from full screen to its smallestsize.andP;  In addition to dynamically resizing fonts as the session window isresized, Extra lets the user easily change to the next-larger or next-smallerfont.andP;  The smallest font supplied is three point for a &quot;postage stamp&quot;on-screen session.andP;  When the user is specifying the fonts, session layoutsand colors, as many as 10 profiles can be saved and assigned to icons inExtra's Program Manager group.andM;Context-sensitive on-line help uses the Windows help engine and contains mostof the Extra users' guide as well as information on Systems NetworkArchitecture host-related error messages.andM;The Request for Proposal (RFP) issued by FVTC asked each vendor to show someof its product's 3270 features as well as its integration into the Windowsenvironment.andP;  DynaComm/Elite won in the first category, and Rumba finishedsecond.andP;  The product also came in first in the integration category, followedby Extra and then Rumba.andM;However, according to one judge, &quot;Rumba had the best demo fulfilling the RFP.andO;It was the best CICS/DDE implementation demonstrated.&quot;andM;Wall Data demonstrated a transfer from the Conversational Monitor System(CMS) to Word that consisted of a 13-line Word macro.andP;  For the CICS-to-Exceltransfer, Wall Data officials created a macro in Rumba that started Excel andkicked off an Excel macro, which then navigated through the PROFS screens toaccess the desired CICS screen and transfer the desired data.andM;For the PROFS front-end demo, Wall Data used Rumba Mailbox, a full-featuredgraphical front end for PROFS.andP;  The company officials also used their RumbaSoftware Development Kit to build on Mailbox.andP;  Through a set of icons, userscan access all major PROFS functions from any PROFS screen.andP;  The team alsoadded a graphical function that accessed FVTC's PROFS phone directory andsearched dynamically for certain names.andP;  This feature was a big hit with thejudges.andM;Wall Data's success in these on-site programming endeavors can be attributedin part to the people that the company sent to participate in the Shoot-Out.andO;James Raisio, vice president of customer services, and Arthur Applegate, asoftware engineer, displayed a high degree of knowledge about and familiaritywith their product.andM;On the other side of the coin, IBM's team of Hudson Philips, advisoryprogrammer, and Tom Murphy, marketing staff consultant, were more familiarwith the Windows part of their solution and less familiar with the 3270 sideof the equation.andP;  The company's 3270-emulation product, Windows Connection,uses IBM's Personal Communications/3270 emulation program for thecommunications function.andM;Windows Connection's strongest features lie in its file-transfercapabilities; it turned in the second-fastest file-transfer times.andP;  WhenWindows Connection is sending a file from PC to host, the host file name isautomatically generated, though it can be modified by the user.andP;  Wild cardsare supported, allowing multiple files to be transferred in a single action.andO;Users can save a list of these files for future use.andM;Unique among all the emulators' functions was this product's ability to pausein the middle of a file transfer and then restart the transfer at a latertime.andP;  This is especially useful when the user is transferring multiplefiles, since the file being transferred at the time of the pause must berestarted.andP;  When receiving a file from the host to the PC, Windows Connectiondoes not generate a list of host files on the transfer dialog screen.andP;  Theteam offered a kludgy solution: They performed a cut and paste from the VMfile list to the transfer dialog box and then selected the host file.andM;Due to the lack of hot-link support, IBM failed to demonstrate solutions forthe CICS-to-Excel or CMS-to-Word automated-transfer applications.andO;Demonstration of a PROFS front end was limited to an automated log-on macroand use of hot spots.andM;As one judge said, &quot;This product would be good in an environment where theapplication development was not heavily centered on the 3270 emulator.andO;Because it's IBM and is supported by them, you know all of the essentialswork, but it will never be on the cutting edge of the market.&quot;andM;Eicon Technology was the only vendor to come to the Shoot-Out with a solutionthat combined software and hardware -- Access for Windows and the MicroChannel version of the EiconCard gateway card.andM;Eicon installed the software on three PS/2s and its EiconCard in a fourth.andO;The first three stations communicated with the fourth through the Token-RingLAN.andP;  Only the PS/2 containing the intelligent EiconCard, acting as agateway, communicated with the 3174 controller.andM;Generally, the judges believed that although standard 3270 Windows featureswere included in Access, they were not as mature as in some of the otherterminal emulators.andM;One judge said, &quot;Keyboard remapping and macro recording were available, butwere not as flexible and easy to use as in other products.&quot; For example, inthe keyboard remapper, it is not possible to determine all of the keycombinations that are mapped to a key or function, such as PA1.andP;  The macrolanguage does not support interactive dialog boxes, thereby requiring usersto hard-code passwords in macros.andM;And although hot spots are supported for PF keys, they are not supported formacro names.andP;  Sessions can be resized, but not to the two-point postage-stampsize that most other emulators support.andP;  When the product is transferringfiles from the host to a PC, the program does not display a host file list.andM;On the positive side, judges particularly liked the optional help commandline, which provided information about the menu bar command being pointed toby the mouse.andM;In its demo of customized applications, Eicon used an Excel macro to open3270 sessions, automatically log-on to VM and perform a cut and paste fromthe CICS system to Excel.andP;  Slow operation was attributed to delays that Eiconhad hard-coded into the macro, which were necessitated by the lack ofevent-driven macro support.andP;  The Eicon team was also stumped by some of thejudges' questions -- proving, once again, the importance of sending the righttechnical people to a Shoot-Out.andM;The judges concurred that, overall, they were extremely impressed with thefunctionality and ease of use of the 3270 Windows emulation programs.andP;  Withtheir incorporation of the Windows' graphical user interface and the additionof functions such as DDE, these products can greatly help users establish a3270 connection from a PC to a mainframe.andM;TO: Vendors of 3270 Terminal EmulatorsandM;FROM: Fox Valley Technical CollegeandM;Fox Valley Technical College (FVTC), a major technical education center inAppleton, Wis., serving more than 45,000 students, is considering thepurchase of 3270 terminal emulators that run under Windows 3.0.andM;In addition to its main campus, the school has a branch campus located inOshkosh, Wis., as well as four regional centers and 21 outreach centers.andM;The computing facilities consist of many PCs and PS/2s, two AS/400s, two4381s and an IBM ES/9000, all connected to an IBM Token-Ring Network andcommunicating via this LAN.andM;FVTC has worked to standardize the PC software used on the personal computersand has chosen Windows 3.0 as its graphical user interface environment.andP;  Thetechnical staff is now looking to replace the character-based 3270 emulatorsthey have been using on all of the mainframe-connected PCs and PS/2s.andM;Vendors are invited to set up their emulators on a PS/2 at the college's mainbranch during the week of Jan.andP;  21, 1991.andP;  Criteria by which the emulatorswill be judged are listed below.andM;An Overview of the TestandM;The vendors will be set up on identically configured IBM PS/2 Model 55SX(8555-061) machines with 16MHz 386SX chips, 4M bytes of RAM, VGA monitors andIBM Micro Channel Token-Ring cards.andM;Each machine will be loaded with DOS 4.01, Windows 3.0, Microsoft Word forWindows and Microsoft Excel for Windows.andP;  These computers will be attached toa Token-Ring LAN, and the server, which is gatewayed into a 3174 controller,will be running Microsoft's LAN Manager.andM;Vendors will not be allowed to add any software or hardware to the PC or PS/2that is not a standard part of their 3270 emulation package.andM;The test will consist of three parts: an interactive PROFS session, anautomated export of numeric data from CICS to Microsoft Excel, and anautomated export of textual data from VM/CMS to Microsoft Word.andP;  FVTC willprovide data in its CICS systems and in a VM/CMS file to complete the lasttwo parts of the test.andM;As part of the interactive PROFS session, vendors will be asked to show theirproduct's existing or customized PROFS front end.andP;  They can develop this attheir own site and then will be given a day prior to the test (8 a.m.andP;  to9:30 p.m.) at FVTC to make any changes needed.andM;Criteria for JudgingandM;After each test, the products will be judged by a panel of corporate usersarea on the following criteria:andM;1.andP;  Ease of use for end users and as a development environment in customizingPC-mainframe application links;andM;2.andP;  Quality of the user interface overall, in exports to Microsoft Excel andMicrosoft Word and in the PROFS front end;andM;3.andP;  Integration into the Windows environment, including the product'sstability, its use of Windows 3.0, its multitasking support, its Dynamic DataExchange (DDE) support, its use of a mouse and icons;andM;4.andP;  3270 emulator and application features, including the quality of theon-line tutorial, on-line help and written documentation; how easy theinstallation process is; the number of 3270 cards and gateways supported; theupload/download features; the cut-and-paste capabilities among 3270 sessionsand Windows applications; the support and ease of overall and user-customizedkeyboard remapping; the ability to call to user exits; the amount ofhard-drive space required; the amount of RAM required for the base3270-emulator application and per additional 3270 session; overall printersupport; print-screen support to the LAN printer; support of multiplesessions; the use of host icons on-screen for easy mouse interaction (PFkeys, alt/sys request, clear, etc.); the use of IND$FILE for file transfer;how 3270 model 2, 3, 4 and 5 displays are supported; DOS concurrency; macrorecording; screen font support and the ability to shrink to small openwindows and view while working on other applications;andM;5.andP;  Performance, including the amount of time needed to upload and download a1M-byte file from PC to VM and vice versa, the amount of time needed toupload the contents of a subdirectory containing five 500K-byte files from PCto VM, and the amount of time needed to download five commonly named500K-byte files from VM to PC.andM;Further Information on the TestandM;During the test, each vendor will be allowed to have only two representativespresent.andP;  At least one of those representatives should be a highly technicalperson capable of dealing with any problems that might arise.andM;The first step in the test will be the physical setup.andP;  Each vendor will begiven three systems on which to set up its product; one system will be usedfor the vendor's demonstration.andM;After the demonstration, all three machines will be available for the judgesto play with.andM;The second step will be to demonstrate the use of the system to the judges.andO;The third step will be the timing test.andM;If at all possible, each vendor should plan to leave its product at FVTCuntil the end of March, or until at least two weeks after the 3270 TerminalEmulation Under Windows 3.0 Shoot-Out report is released on March 4, 1991.andO;This is a request, but FVTC will require that the product be left asinstalled until Monday, Jan.andP;  28, 1991, as the judges will need extra timewith the product.andM;Travel Arrangements and Further QuestionsandM;The test will take place at Fox Valley Technical College.andP;  Judith Brown,microcomputer manager of FVTC, and Julian Milenbach, senior technical analystfrom PC Week, will conduct the test with the assistance of Brown's staff.andM;FVTC and each vendor will agree on a date and time for the test in advance.andO;The tests will take approximately two hours per vendor.andM;Prior to the test, the vendor will supply FVTC with: a company history,financial data to determine the health of the company, information on thevendor's service and support policy as well as the product's availabilitydata, three users that FVTC could contact as references and the number ofinstallations of the product.andM;Finally, please note Fox Valley Technical College understands that no testother than real-world usage is ever entirely adequate, but this one will at aminimum provide a very useful simulation of 3270 terminal emulation underWindows 3.0 in the real world.andM;By Julian MilenbachandM;SIXTEEN IDENTICALLY CONFIGUREDandM;IBM PS/2 Model 55SX PCs were used in PC Week Labs' 3270 Terminal EmulationUnder Windows 3.0 Shoot-Out.andM;Each system was equipped with a 30M-byte hard drive, a Microsoft mouse, anIBM 8513 color display, 4M bytes of RAM and an IBM Micro Channel 16/4To-ken-Ring adapter board operating at 4M bps.andP;  IBM's DOS 4.0, MicrosoftCorp.'s Windows 3.0, Microsoft Word for Windows 1.0, Microsoft Excel forWindows 2.1d, IBM Local Area Network Support Program 1.1 and IBM PC LocalArea Network Program 1.31 were installed on each computer.andM;Each PS/2 was attached to a Token-Ring Network that was locally attached to a3174 controller through a Token-Ring adapter card in the 3174.andP;  The 3174 waschannel attached to an IBM ES/9000 mainframe.andP;  Four Logical Units weredefined within Virtual Telecommunications Access Method (VTAM) for each PS/2.andO;For data transfer, Write Structured Fields were enabled.andP;  A Hewlett-PackardCo. LaserJet II was attached to the Token-Ring Network.andM;Six firms participated in the Shoot-Out: Attachmate Corp. of Bellevue, Wash.;andO;Eicon Technology Corp. of Montreal; IBM of Armonk, N.Y.; Wall Data Inc. ofRedmond, Wash.; and Future Soft Engineering Inc. of Houston and NetworkSoftware Associates Inc. of Laguna Hills, Calif.andP;  These last two companiescompeted as a team since they jointly developed and market their product.andM;The testing week was split into two sections with three vendors competing onone day and two on another.andP;  All vendors were given more than 13 hours (8a.m.andP;  to 9:30 p.m.) to set up their products and develop the customizedsolutions called for in the Request for Proposal (see Page S/27).andM;Performance testing on all products was conducted by the PC Week Labs staffon Friday.andM;Each vendor was required to install its emulator on three systems -- one tobe used during the judging, and two others that the judges could use fortheir own hands-on evaluations of the products.andM;Eicon Technology used a fourth system for its gateway card.andP;  Each vendor wasallowed to install only hardware and software included in its package assold.andM;All of the computers were housed in a single room at Fox Valley TechnicalCollege (FVTC) in Appleton, Wis.andP;  To facilitate the presentations, thesystems were at-tached to an overhead projector.andM;The projection used for the judging was black-and-white because the colorversion of the projection system would not show the mouse action withinWindows 3.0.andP;  The judges determined that it was more important to see how thesystem worked than to see the colors projected by the programs.andP;  The judgeswere given the opportunity to see the color display after the presentationwas complete.andM;Each vendor was asked to develop a number of applications during its setupday and to demonstrate its 3270 Windows terminal emulator as well as thecustomized applications to the judges on the next day.andM;The first application that was requested of the vendors was an automated linkbetween FVTC's CICS-based industry contract tracking system and MicrosoftExcel.andP;  Each vendor team was encouraged to be creative in the development ofits applications.andP;  The resulting solution could be as simple as a DynamicData Exchange (DDE) hot link or as complex as using sophisticated scripts toperform automated functions.andM;The second task was to set up an automated link between a file on thecollege's IBM VM system and Microsoft Word.andM;In the third application, each vendor was asked to set up and demo a frontend for FVTC's PROFS system on IBM's VM.andP;  Although the vendors were notexpected to develop a complete PROFS front end in one day, they wereencouraged to be creative in automating some function of PROFS and to showoff the capabilities of their emulation product.andM;Performance was measured through the upload and download of data between thePC and VM on the mainframe computer.andP;  A 100K-byte ASCII file was uploadedthree times and downloaded three times using each emulator.andP;  In each case, anaverage of the three measurements was used.andP;  CPU utilization, paging andswapping were measured throughout the tests to ensure that they remainedconsistent.andM;These exercises illustrated the ability of the 3270 terminal emulationproduct to serve some common needs in a corporate setting.andP;  With any testingthere are many components.andM;As with all product evaluations, the true test of the product is inreal-world usage.andP;  These tests were designed to address some needs, but couldnot hope to address all within the time constraints placed on the vendors andthe judges.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
