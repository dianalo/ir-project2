(products).andO;Product:   Folio Views (Computer program).andO;Topic:     SearchingInformation Storage and RetrievalEvaluationSoftware packages.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Folio Views: For When You Outgrow Personal Information A few years ago,virtually all the information on your personal computer was probably justthat--personal.andP;  It was yours to create, edit, and delete.andP;  Today,networking, CD-ROMs, and online services put a bounty of corporate, public,and professional information at your fingertips.andP;  For many, the volume ofdata has grown so great that they need special text-retrieval software inorder to manage it effectively.andM;Programs that search and organize text have been available for years, butthose that can handle large amounts of text are generally too complex foreveryday use.andP;  And easy-to-use text-retrieval programs often can't handlelarge amounts of text, or they perform poorly when the database beingsearched grows larger than the available memory.andM;Folio Views, the first commercial product from the Folio Corporation, strikesa balance between these two extremes and brings sophisticated text retrievalto the PC.andP;  The program gets its name from its ability to create &quot;views,&quot;virtual organizations of text blocks.andP;  Views can be extracts or narrowedlooks at a database or the entire database itself.andP;  The company believes thatthe $495 program will be a boon to information services and publishers whowant to create searchable electronic versions of their works.andM;One of Views' greatest strengths is the amoung of data it can handle.andP;  AViews database (called an infobase) can grow as large as 2 gigabytes,containing nearly four times as much information as a CD-ROM can accomodate.andM;Data in an infobase can be quickly searched with Views.andP;  The display showsmatched words as you type them, so you know right away if your search will besuccessful.andP;  Although the program will not do an inexact, or fuzzy, search,you can use wildcard characters in a query.andM;Large databases and fast searching are useful only if you can get the data inand out easily.andP;  Views readily accepts ASCII files, and you can enter or edittext using the program's built-in word processor.andP;  It's no WordPerfect, butit has more features (including underline, boldface, and word wrap) than mosttext-retrieval programs do.andP;  Folio says future versions of Views will supportthe file formats of popular programs.andM;Although Views is a new product, you may already own its predecessor, aproduct called PreViews.andP;  A stripped-down, read-only version of Views,PreViews has been bundled with Novell's NetWare program since last September.andO;According to Folio, an estimated 1.5 million NetWare users have access toPreViews and can read documents published in Views format (including NetWaredocumentation).andM;Folio believes that this installed base will make the Views format attractiveto publishers of electronic documents.andP;  The company announced licensing anddevelopment agreements with a number of publishers (including Mead DataCentral and McGraw-Hill) in March but gave no details on specific products.andM;For more information contact the Folio Corporation, in Provo, Utah, at801-375-3700 or 800-USE-FOLIO.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
