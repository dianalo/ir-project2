It was the second 24-hour strike in eight days by 75,000 nationalrailroad workers and the eighth unofficial walkout in 12 weeks bythe capital's 10,500 subway workers.   Traffic jams in London started two hours early and traffic ``isdefinitely heavier than usual,'' said Scotland Yard spokeswomanAlison Bland.   Birmingham, Liverpool, Manchester, Edinburgh and Glasgow alsoreported earlier rush hours with more traffic congestion thannormal, the Automobile Association said.   Last Wednesday, there was little of the traffic chaos that mighthave been expected from a triple-barreled strike that hit thenational railroad and London's buses and subways. Many commuterscarefully planned their journeys, and others simply stayed at home.   This week, major companies again hired fleets of coaches to bringin staff, and London hotels were full of employees spending thenight in the city to beat the strike.   The 248-station subway system carries 2.7 million passengers aday, while rail services are used by some 2 million people.   A sharply reduced subway service was operating on two of London's10 subway lines, said London Underground spokesman David Morris.   London's buses, which carry 3.2 million people daily, appeared tobe working normally today, and special shuttle services were addedbetween Victoria Station in central London and the southern suburbof Wimbledon, where the two-week lawn tennis championships openedMonday.   ``I think it's absolutely disgraceful that people in thetransport unions don't think about their fellow citizens,'' PrimeMinister Margaret Thatcher told Sky News, the cable televisionnetwork.   ``It's the public sector unions that are the problem ... Thosepeople are there to serve the public but they don't,'' she said.   The National Union of Railwaymen is striking against state-ownedBritish Rail's offer of a 7 percent wage hike, and union leaderJimmy Knapp is demanding a pay rise of at least 10 percent.   The subway workers want a $99 weekly increase to operate withouta guard. Management is offering $46 a week plus 14 days extra annualvacation, but is tying the raise to increase productivity.   The union plans another one-day strike on July 5 unless BritishRail raises its pay offer.</TEXT></DOC>
