(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Pennsylvania is ready to adopt thenation's toughest anti-takeover law despite an outcry from thenation's investment community and securities regulators.   Lawmakers and Gov. Robert P. Casey are standing behind themeasure despite claims by fund managers that it will cut offPennsylvania companies from investment and that hostile takeoversare dying out for lack of financing.   ``The bill is an overreaction to a problem that is pretty muchin its final stages,'' said Charles M. LaLoggia, editor ofLaLoggia's Special Situation Report, a newsletter on takeoverstocks.   ``It's sort of like the Keystone Kops arriving at the scene of acrime about a month late,'' he added.   The measure is supported by a labor-business coalition that saysit will protect the state's business and jobs from corporateraiders.   The bill likely will come to a final vote in the state Senate bythe end of April. It cleared the House April 3 by a 182-10 vote,and the Senate approved an earlier version in December by 45-4.Casey says he backs the bill.   ``He is very strong in his support of legislation that wouldprevent raids on Pennsylvania companies and jobs,'' said Casey'sspokesman, Vincent Carocci.   Fund managers have lobbied against the bill since itsintroduction last year, and they won a key ally last week inRichard C. Breeden, chairman of the Securities and ExchangeCommission.   Breeden denounced the bill in an April 2 speech, saying it woulddeny shareholders their rights and allow bad managers ``to run acompany into the ground.''   He said Pennsylvania, Indiana and other states are trying to``tilt the balance of corporate power in favor of corporatemanagement and against shareholders.''   Hostile takeovers have cost Pennsylvania thousands of jobs andthe loss of such corporate mainstays as Gulf Oil Co., which closedits Pittsburgh headquarters after it was merged with Chevron Oil.The state ranks ranks fourth in the number of Fortune 500 companyheadquarters.   The AFL-CIO estimates about 90,000 jobs were lost around thenation over the last decade because of mergers, takeovers andleveraged buyouts.   But LaLoggia said the market already is correcting past abuses.   The excesses of corporate raiders have made it ``almostimpossible to raise money in the junk bond market and the bankingsystem for the type of leveraged buyout that caused companies toget into trouble,'' he said.   Those arguments hold little sway with the bill's sponsor, Sen.Noah Wenger.   ``This is precisely the time to move ahead,'' he said. The lawalso will be a model for other states, Wenger adds.   Pennsylvania already has some of the nation's toughestanti-takeover laws. In 1983 and 1988, the state adopted measures toblock creeping tender offers, two-tiered offers and efforts tosqueeze out minority shareholders in order to finance takeoverswith corporation assets.   The push for even stronger sanctions started after the Belzbergfamily of Canada started buying into Armstrong World IndustriesInc., a Lancaster, Pa.-based building products manufacturer.   The Belzbergs now own a 10.68 percent stake in the $2.5billion-a-year company and are waging a proxy fight to elect fourcandidates to the 14-member board at the company's April 30 annualmeeting.   A key plank of the bill that has sent opponents into a frenzy isa so-called disgorgement section.   For the first time in the nation, the measure would requirecorporate raiders to surrender profits earned by selling shareswithin 18 months of making a takeover bid. Supporters say thesection will prevent the payment of greenmail, the practice ofbuying back stock from a raider at an above-market price.   Also under the bill, raiders who gain 20 percent or more of acompany would not get voting rights until approved by othershareholders. Opponents contend this stipulation will make itvirtually impossible to wage proxy fights.   The bill also would allow company directors to act in theinterest of the entire corporation and to consider interests otherthan those of shareholders in assessing takeover offers. Suchinterests could include a takeover's impact on employees, customersor the community. Opponents say that would violate management'sfiduciary duty to stockholders.   In provisions supported by organized labor, the bill spells outthat employees must be paid severance and that labor contracts mustbe honored when corporate ownership changes hands.   More than half the states have enacted takeover laws, butIndiana is the only other state that allows managers to play downshareholders' interests, said James E. Heard, managing director ofThe Analysis Group, a Massachusetts-based financial consultantretained by the Belzbergs.   About half the states also have limited restrictions on votingrights for acquisitions of large stakes, but they are not as broadas those proposed for Pennsylvania, Heard added.</TEXT></DOC>
