Plural pairs of support forks are spaced along the conveyor for      suspending one chicken carcass by its legs from each fork pair with the      legs sufficiently spread from each other to maintain the chicken in the      opened generally flat condition. A spaced pair of deflector plates are      provided along the conveyor following the cooking chamber for discharging      both legs of each chicken simultaneously from the pair of support forks      suspending the chicken. </PAL></ABST><BSUM> <PAC>  BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  The present invention relates generally to apparatus and methods for      cooking foods on an automated basis utilizing a conveyor for transporting      foods through a heated cooking area. In particular, the present invention      relates to such an apparatus and method specifically adapted for broiling      whole chickens and other meats. </PAR><PAR>  Over recent years, consumers have become increasingly concerned with fat      and cholesterol content of many common and popular foods, particularly      meats. As a result, the rate of consumption of leaner types of meats,      particularly chicken and other poultry, has been progressively increasing.      At the same time, the methods by which meat and other foods are prepared      is now viewed as being of equal importance, oil-based frying of foods      being disfavored because it substantially increases the fat content of      prepared foods while broiling of foods has become increasingly popular      since this preparation method involves no addition of fat to the food. </PAR><PAR>  Disadvantageously, however, the increased popularity of broiling as a food      preparation method poses several problems for restaurant owners and others      involved in commercial and large-scale preparation of foods. One of the      most common commercial food broiling systems utilizes a grill suspended      over a heat-generating source, typically a gas-fueled burner. During the      cooking of virtually any meat on such a broiling apparatus, fat rendered      from the meat falls onto the burner producing a considerable amount of      smoke, fire and fumes, all of which must be exhausted from the cooking      area. In order to do so in many restaurants and other large-scale food      preparation operations, it is necessary to maintain high rates of air      exhaust from the cooking area, generally through an exhaust flue and      filtering arrangement. While a sufficiently high rate of air exhaust is      sufficient in most cases to maintain the cooking and serving areas of      restaurants and like establishments substantially free of smoke and fumes,      the operators of such establishments incur substantially increased      equipment and operational expenses for both the exhaust system and for air      conditioning and heating the establishment. Further, various Federal,      State and/or local laws and regulations prohibit the direct release of the      exhausted effluent of the cooking process into the ambient atmosphere.      Accordingly, an air filtering arrangement of a capacity suitable to handle      air at the prevailing rate of exhaust must be utilized, additionally      increasing the cost of operation. Finally, broiling apparatus of this      basic type generally require an operator with a reasonably high level of      skill and experience to attend the meat being cooked on the apparatus to      insure sufficient cooking without overcooking and burning of the meat. </PAR><PAR>  Various types of automated cooking apparatus have been proposed wherein      meat is transported by a continuous conveyor system between      vertically-oriented opposed facing burners or other cooking elements to      reduce the generation of smoke and fumes while at the same time automating      the cooking process. Representative examples of such apparatus are      disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 2,718,188 to Read et al; 3,646,879 to Palmason      et al; 4,366,182 to Kohler et al; and 4,753,216 to Nolte. Of these      apparatus, only the Kohler et al patent contemplates use of such an      apparatus for cooking whole chickens or other relatively large      irregularly-shaped meat items, the apparatus of the other patents being      particularly designed and intended for broiling steaks, chops, hamburgers      and the like. </PAR><PAR>  One of the most important criteria for the commercial acceptability of any      such apparatus is that the meat item must be uniformly cooked over its      entire mass. Since many common meat items are typically of a non-uniform      thickness and have a non-uniform distribution of fat (with the possible      exception of hamburger patties), this criteria is difficult to reliably      achieve on a repeatable regular basis in a commercial setting utilizing an      apparatus of the type of the above-identified patents wherein      substantially the same amount of cooking heat energy is applied by the      opposed burners to all exposed surfaces of the meat item without regard to      any inherent irregularities in shape, thickness and fat content of the      meat. </PAR><PAR>  This problem would be particularly acute in the broiling of whole chickens      as contemplated in the Kohler patent due to the irregular shape of      chickens and the irregular distribution of fat, which is concentrated      under the skin of the chicken in the region of the thighs and back. In      this respect, conventional grill-type broiling apparatus have a notable      advantage over conveyorized apparatus of the type of the above-identified      patents in that a skilled attendant can regulate the uniformity of cooking      of meat items by continuously turning the meat items and changing their      position on the grill. </PAR><PAR>  An additional problem to be addressed in an automated conveyorized cooking      apparatus of the general type disclosed in the above-identified patents is      how to mount the meat or other food item being cooked to the conveyor      apparatus so as to securely support the food products against undesired      movement relative to the conveyor apparatus while also facilitating easy      removal therefrom at the completion of the cooking process. Ideally, a      cooking apparatus of this type should be equipped with an automated      removal device or mechanism to avoid the necessity of utilizing an      operator to monitor the apparatus and manually remove cooked food products      from the conveyor apparatus. In the Kohler et al patent, whole chickens      are mounted on vertical spits on the conveyor apparatus, requiring that      the chickens be manually removed by an attendant. The apparatus of the      other identified patents are neither designed nor intended for cooking      chickens or other poultry so that these apparatus provide no teaching or      suggestion for achieving the foregoing objectives in an automated cooking      apparatus designed for chickens and other poultry. </PAR><PAC>  SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  It is accordingly an object of the present invention to provide an improved      apparatus and method for broiled cooking of whole chickens and other      poultry on an automated conveyorized basis. A particular object of the      present invention is to provide a novel conveyor arrangement for reliably      supporting whole chicken carcasses in an open generally flat condition to      facilitate cooking uniformity. A further object of the present invention      is to provide a reliable arrangement for automatically removing cooked      chicken carcasses from the conveyor arrangement at the completion of the      cooking process. </PAR><PAR>  The present invention contemplates the preliminary preparation of whole      chicken carcasses for cooking by severing each carcass along its breast      bone and opening the carcass into a generally flat condition wherein its      internal chest and abdominal cavity forms one side of the chicken carcass      and its breast, back, wings, thighs and legs form the opposite side of the      chicken carcass. </PAR><PAR>  Briefly summarized, the cooking apparatus of the present invention      basically comprises an arrangement for generating cooking energy utilizing      a pair of energy-emitting faces spaced from one another in generally      upright laterally-opposed facing relation for defining therebetween a      cooking area and an endless conveyor for transporting whole chicken      carcasses individually along a cooking path through the cooking area      between the energy-emitting faces. According to the present invention, the      conveyor has a plurality of support members spaced therealong, each of      which is configured for suspending one chicken leg therefrom. Each such      support member is sufficiently spaced from another such support member for      cooperatively suspending a whole chicken carcass by its legs with the legs      sufficiently spread from one another to maintain the chicken carcass      opened in its afore-described generally flat condition. </PAR><PAR>  As will be understood, each leg of each chicken carcass has a free end      terminating at a knuckle which is relatively enlarged with respect to the      adjacent portion of the chicken leg. Accordingly, each support member of      the conveyor is preferably configured to engage a chicken leg at the      portion thereof adjacent its terminal end knuckle. In the preferred      embodiment, each support member is generally of a fork shape having a      laterally-spaced pair of prongs for receiving therebetween the portion of      a chicken leg adjacent its terminal end knuckle with the knuckle resting      on the prongs. </PAR><PAR>  A suitable arrangement is provided in association with the conveyor at an      exit end of the generating arrangement for automatically removing each      chicken carcass from the spaced pair of support members from which the      chicken carcass is suspended, preferably by simultaneously deflecting each      leg of each chicken carcass outwardly from the prongs of the support      member from which the leg is suspended. In the preferred embodiment, a      pair of defector plates are stationarily arranged adjacent the conveyor at      a spacing therealong corresponding to the spacing between a spaced pair of      the support members. The prongs of the leading support member of each      spaced pair of support members extend outwardly from the conveyor to a      greater extent than the prongs of the other trailing support member of      each spaced pair of support members. The first deflector plate along the      direction of travel of the conveyor is accordingly arranged to deflect a      chicken leg on each leading support member only partially outwardly with      respect to the longer prongs thereof and to deflect a chicken leg on each      trailing support member fully outwardly from its shorter prongs. The      second deflector plate along the direction of travel of the conveyor is      arranged to deflect a chicken leg on each leading support member fully      outwardly from its longer prongs. </PAR><PAR>  It is preferred that the prongs of each support member have a covering of      material which resists sticking of chicken skin thereto during cooking.      Preferably, the covering is in the form of a sleeve of a stick-resistant      plastic material fitted on each prong in a manner which enables the      covering to be selectively removable and replaced when necessary. </PAR></BSUM><DRWD> <PAC>  BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS </PAC><PAR>  FIG. 1 is a perspective view of a cooking apparatus according to the      preferred embodiment of the present invention, taken from one end of the      apparatus; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 2 is another perspective view of the cooking apparatus of FIG. 1,      taken from the opposite end of the apparatus; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 3 is an end elevational view, partially in vertical cross-section, of      the cooking apparatus of FIG. 1, taken along line 3--3 thereof; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 4 is a vertical cross-sectional view of the cooking apparatus of FIG.      1, taken lengthwise thereof along line 4--4 of FIG. 3; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 5 is another vertical cross-sectional view of the cooking apparatus of      FIG. 1, also taken lengthwise thereof along line 5--5 of FIG. 3; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 6 is a top plan view of the deflector arrangement of the cooking      apparatus for removing chickens from the conveyor; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 7 is an end elevational view of an embodiment of the present invention      wherein two of the cooking apparatus of FIG. 1 are arranged in stacked      relation to one another; and </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 8 is a perspective view of a partial length of the conveyor, showing      the forks which support chickens thereon. </PAR></DRWD><DETD> <PAC>  DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </PAC><PAR>  Referring now to the accompanying drawings and initially to FIGS. 1 and 2,      the cooking apparatus of the present invention is indicated generally at      10 in an embodiment thereof preferred for automated broiling of whole      chicken carcasses 12 on a continuous basis in a commercial restaurant      setting. However, those persons skilled in the art will readily recognize      and understand that the present cooking apparatus and the cooking method      performed thereby are susceptible of various other specific embodiments,      e.g., for automated continuous broiling or other cooking of various other      food products, all of which are intended to be within the scope and      substance of the present invention. </PAR><PAR>  As best seen in FIGS. 1 and 2, the present cooking apparatus 10 includes a      floor-standing frame 14 which supports an insulated housing 16 defining an      interior cooking chamber 18 (FIG. 3) generally in the form of a tunnel      extending lengthwise the full length of the housing 16 from an entry      opening 20 at one end of the housing 16 to an exit opening 22 at the      opposite end of the housing 16. An endless chain-type conveyor 24 is      trained about a plurality of sprockets 26 rotatably supported by the      housing 16 for traveling movement of the conveyor 24 along an operative      cooking run 28 extending lengthwise through the housing 16 generally      centrally of the cooking chamber 18 at the upper limit thereof and a      return run 30 also extending lengthwise of the housing 16 but outside      thereof in the opposite direction. One of the sprockets 26 is operatively      driven by a variable speed electric drive motor 32 while the remaining      sprockets 26 are mounted for free rotation as idler sprockets. </PAR><PAR>  A cooking arrangement is mounted within the housing 16 to generate cooking      energy within the cooking chamber 18, the cooking arrangement basically      presenting a pair of energy-emitting faces spaced from one another in      generally upright laterally-opposed facing relation at opposite sides of      the operative run 28 of the conveyor 24 thereby to define the opposite      lateral limits of the cooking chamber 18. In the preferred embodiment as      illustrated in FIGS. 3-5, the cooking arrangement includes a first      plurality of heater panels 34 arranged in generally co-planar      laterally-spaced alignment with one another along one side of the cooking      chamber 18 and a like plurality of heater panels 36 similarly arranged in      laterally-spaced co-planar alignment with one another at the opposite side      of the cooking chamber 18. The heater panels 34,36 are of the conventional      type having a body of glass-covered ceramic-like material forming the      outer face of the panel with a plurality of small orifices being formed in      the ceramic body for delivering a mixture of a gaseous fuel, e.g., natural      gas, and air for burning at the outer surface or face of the ceramic body. </PAR><PAR>  In this manner, the heater panels 34,36 emit infrared radiation toward one      another to heat and cook food products transported through the cooking      chamber 18 predominantly by radiant energy but importantly the heater      panels 34,36 do not correspondingly elevate the temperature of air within      the cooking chamber 18. To enhance this effect, the opposed sets of heater      panels 34,36 are arranged in staggered relationship to one another, i.e.,      each heater panel 34,36 is situated to directly face the abutting frame      margins of a pair of the opposing heater panels 34,36 and, further, a      generally V-shaped metal reflector plate 38 is disposed along the full      extent of the adjacent margins of each adjacent pair of heater panels      34,36 to extend therefrom toward the opposite side of the cooking chamber      18. In this manner, the radiant heat energy emitted by the heater panels      34,36, which otherwise would be substantially absorbed by the frame      margins of the opposing heater panels 36,34, is at least partially      reflected back toward the central area of the cooking chamber 18. </PAR><PAR>  In the preferred embodiment illustrated, the cooking apparatus 10 is      particularly adapted for broiling whole chickens which, after slaughter      and evisceration, have been severed along the breast bone and opened into      a generally flat condition wherein the rib cage and the other internal      portions of the chicken carcass bordering its chest and abdominal cavity      form one side of the chicken carcass while the meat portion of the chicken      carcass, namely, its breast, back, wings, thighs and legs, form the      opposite side of the chicken carcass. Such a chicken carcass is shown at      12 in FIG. 1. It is already known to broil whole chicken carcasses in this      opened generally flat condition on a conventional gas-fired grilling      apparatus. </PAR><PAR>  To facilitate transportation of chicken carcasses 12 in the same opened      generally flat condition through the cooking chamber 18 of the present      cooking apparatus 10, a plurality of support forks 40 are rigidly affixed      to the chain conveyor 24 at spacings along its length for suspending the      chicken carcasses 12 by their legs. Specifically, as best seen in FIG. 8,      each support fork 40 has a pair of arcuate prongs 42 laterally spaced from      one another by a dimension smaller than the typical cross-sectional size      of the endmost leg knuckle of a mature chicken yet larger than the      cross-sectional size of the narrower adjacent extent of a typical mature      chicken leg. The outermost ends of each pair of prongs 42 are unconnected      to one another. Thus, a chicken leg may be readily supported by the prongs      42 of each support fork 40 simply by inserting the narrowest portion of      the chicken leg between the free ends of the prongs 42 with the endmost      knuckle of the chicken leg above the prongs 42 to rest thereon whereby the      leg extends downwardly from the fork 40 in depending fashion. The support      forks 40 are arranged in pairs along the chain conveyor 24, the individual      forks 40 of each pair being spaced from one another by a sufficient      dimension to receive the two legs of a prepared chicken carcass when the      legs are spread sufficiently from one another to open the carcass into its      substantially flat condition as afore-described. </PAR><PAR>  Preferably, the forks 40 are fabricated of metal to provide sturdiness and      to resist thermal damage from continuous heating within the cooking      chamber 18. However, because the metal material will naturally absorb heat      during travel through the cooking chamber 18, bare metal forks 40 will      tend to sear the skin of a chicken leg at the points of engagement      therewith typically causing the skin to stick to the prongs 42, which      makes it difficult to reliably remove the cooked chicken carcasses from      the forks 40 without tearing or damaging the skin of the chicken legs. To      prevent this occurrence, each prong 42 of each support fork 40 is fitted      with an outer sleeve 44 of a stick-resistent plastic material such as      Teflon brand tetrafluoroethylene fluorocarbon resin. Such material is      commercially available in continuous tubular form and, therefore, may be      cut to a desirable length which will readily slide onto a bare prong 42      after heating thereof during travel through the cooking chamber 18. The      heat of the prong 42 effectively adheres the plastic sleeve 44 thereto.      The arcuate shape of each prong 42 allows the tubular sleeve 44 to conform      to the same curvature without the undesirable formation of folds or      wrinkles in the plastic sleeve 44. Advantageously, if the protective      sleeve 44 becomes cut or otherwise damaged during ongoing operation of the      cooking apparatus 10, the sleeve 44 may be readily removed from its prong      42 using a knife or other common cutting tool and quickly replaced with      another length of the plastic tubing. </PAR><PAR>  At the exit end of the housing 16, a discharge arrangement, generally      indicated at 46 in FIGS. 2 and 6, is mounted in association with the      conveyor 24 outwardly of the housing 16 for automatically removing cooked      chickens from the support forks 40 of the conveyor 24. As will be      understood, after being fully cooked during travel through the cooking      chamber 18, the meat of the chickens 12 becomes tender and the joints of      the skeletal structure of the chicken become substantially weakened.      Accordingly, it is important to simultaneously discharge both legs of a      chicken carcass from the pair of forks 40 on which it is supported to      avoid possible tearing or separation of the main body of the chicken      carcass from one leg which may tend to occur if the full weight of the      chicken carcass is supported from only the one leg. </PAR><PAR>  For this purpose, the respective prongs 42 of the support forks 40 of each      associated pair are of differing lengths, the prongs 42' of the leading      fork 40' of each pair being slightly longer than the prongs 42&quot; of the      trailing fork 40&quot; of each associated pair thereof. The discharge      arrangement 46 includes a pair of deflector plates 48,50 mounted directly      beneath the terminal extent of the operative run 28 of the conveyor 24      immediately outside the exit opening 22 of the housing 16. The deflector      plates 48,50 are spaced from one another by substantially the same      dimension as the spacing between the support forks 40 of each associated      pair thereof. Each deflector plate 48,50 extends at an angle outwardly      with respect to the conveyor 24 in the same direction as the prongs 42      extend from the conveyor 24, the first deflector plate 48 in the direction      of traveling movement of the conveyor 24 having a lesser outwardly      projecting extent than the following deflector plate 50. The angular      extension of the deflector plate 48 is selected to be sufficient to      discharge a chicken leg from each support fork 40&quot; having shorter prongs      42&quot;, but only to move the chicken leg on each support fork 40' having      longer prongs 42' outwardly to the terminal extent of the longer prongs      42' without actually discharging the leg from the longer prongs 42'. The      greater angular extent of the following deflector plate 50 is selected to      be sufficient to subsequently fully discharge a chicken leg from each      support fork 40' having longer prongs 42'. Thus, as each associated pair      of support forks 40 pass the deflector plates 48,50, he two legs of the      chicken 12 supported thereby are simultaneously discharged by the      deflector plates 48,50. A wire chute 52 is disposed directly beneath the      deflector plates 48,50 and extends downwardly therefrom to a collection      basket (not shown) for receiving each discharged chicken 12. </PAR><PAR>  The interior of the housing 16 is equipped with an exhaust hood formed by a      pair of ceiling panels 56, 58 which extend angularly upwardly in      converging relation from the lengthwise interior side walls of the housing      16 above the respective sets of heater panels 34,36 to a point of      convergence directly above the lengthwise central area of the cooking      chamber 18, as best seen in FIG. 3. The ceiling panel 56 is formed with a      plurality of exhaust openings regularly spaced along its length      immediately adjacent its intersection with the ceiling panel 58, each      exhaust opening 60 communicating with a respective exhaust duct 62 which      extends horizontally outwardly through the adjacent lengthwise side wall      of the housing 16 and then upwardly therefrom for communication with      suitable ducting or the like for exhaustion to the outside of the      restaurant or other establishment in which the apparatus 10 is operated.      Advantageously, this described exhaust arrangement, by providing for      lateral exhaust of the cooking chamber 18 through the      horizontally-extending ducts 60,62, enables the housing 16 of the cooking      apparatus to be compactly configured of a rectangularly box-shape which,      in turn, enables two or more of the housings 16 to be stacked in      superposed relation to one another, as illustrated in FIG. 7, enabling the      overall production capacity of the cooking apparatus to be essentially      doubled without occupying additional floor space. </PAR><PAR>  Preferably, the exhaust ducts 62 are not directly connected with a fan or      other means of forced air movement. Instead, the converging configuration      of the ceiling panels 56, 58 in conjunction with the exhaust ducts 62      creates a natural chimney effect to produce a continuous convective flow      of air into the housing 16, upwardly through the cooking chamber 18, and      outwardly through the exhaust openings and ducts 60,62. Preferably, the      rate of air flow is no greater than is necessary to sufficiently exhaust      any smoke, fumes and other airborne effluent released from the chickens 12      or otherwise generated during the cooking process and also to maintain a      generally constant air temperature within the cooking chamber 18 so that      all chickens 12 are uniformly cooked to the same degree without regard to      the quantity of chickens being cooked or the frequency with which chickens      are delivered into the cooking apparatus 10. This aspect of the present      cooking apparatus and method is particularly important to the reliable      operation of the apparatus 10 in a commercial restaurant setting. As will      be understood, it will sometimes be necessary for a restaurant operator to      utilize the cooking apparatus 10 for preparing only a relatively few      chickens on a relatively infrequent basis during periods of slow customer      patronage, but at other times to operate the cooking apparatus at its      fullest capacity. It is therefore important to insure that the heating of      air within the cooking chamber 18 has a minimal affect on the cooking      process under both extremes, which the present apparatus and method      achieved. </PAR><PAR>  The interior of the housing 16 may also be provided with a collection      trough 66 (FIG. 3) mounted to the end side walls of the housing 16      directly beneath the cooking chamber 18 for collecting grease and the like      rendered from the chicken carcasses 12 during the cooking operation. The      collection trough 66 is inclined slightly from one end of the housing 16      to the other to drain all such material into a suitable container (not      shown) for disposal. Alternatively, the housing 16 may be equipped with      removable drawers (not shown) slidably supported in the interior of the      housing 16 beneath the cooking chamber 18 for collecting grease while also      being removable for cleaning. It is contemplated that the drawers would be      inclined to one side of the housing for drainage of collected grease to      the outside of the housing 16. Advantageously, both collector embodiments      enable the collection of substantially clear, clean chicken grease which      can be utilized for other purposes, e.g. the production of cosmetics. The      latter embodiment provides the additional advantages of ease of cleaning      and maintenance of the cooking apparatus in a commercial restaurant      setting. </PAR><PAR>  Since in either case the grease collector is disposed below the heater      panels 34,36, the collector is not directly heated by the panels 34,36 and      accordingly remains relatively cool, thereby minimizing the production of      smoke, fumes and the like when grease and like drippings from the chickens      strike the collection trough 66. Thus, although as above-described it is      desirable in the operation of the present cooking apparatus 10 to maintain      a continuous exhaust air flow through the cooking chamber 18, the rate of      such air flow will in all cases be substantially lower than is      conventionally required in the operation of a commercial gas-fueled      grilling apparatus. </PAR><PAR>  In operation of the cooking apparatus 10, the time required for cooking      chickens 12 and the degree to which the chickens are cooked are modulated      by means of two basic adjustments in the apparatus 10. First, the pressure      or rate at which gaseous fuel is supplied to the heater panels 34,36 may      be adjusted through a suitable supply valve in the gas supply system (not      shown), which enables the temperature to which chickens 12 are subjected      in the cooking chamber 18 to be selectively increased and decreased.      Secondly, the operational speed of the conveyor drive motor 32 may be      adjusted to selectively increase and decrease the traveling speed of the      conveyor 24 which, in turn, determines the cooking time, i.e., the time      required for each chicken 12 to travel through the entirety of the cooking      chamber 18 between its entrance and exit ends 20,22. Presently, it is      considered preferable that these two variables be adjusted to accomplish      cooking of each individual chicken 12 within a total cooking time of 20-25      minutes. </PAR><PAR>  As is known, although chicken meat is relatively lean, chickens      nevertheless characteristically have a concentration of fatty tissue      directly beneath the skin in the region of the thighs and back,      particularly where they connect with the breast. It has been discovered      that, when the meat-side of a chicken in the opened generally flat      condition hereinabove described is exposed directly to a radiant gas-fired      burner of the type utilized in the present apparatus for a sufficient      continuous period of time to accomplish cooking of the chicken meat, the      skin of the chicken in this fatty region becomes severely burnt while the      underlying meat does not cook as fully as the meat elsewhere in the      chicken, all of which would necessarily make the cooked chicken unsuitable      for restaurant sales. Presumably, this condition results from the greater      content of fat underlying the chicken skin in the thigh and back region. </PAR><PAR>  To prevent burning of the chicken skin in the fatty region and undercooking      of the underlying meat, the present cooking apparatus 10 contemplates that      chickens 12 are always to be mounted in the same orientation on the      support forks 40 of the conveyor 24 so that the meat side of every chicken      faces the same set of heater panels, e.g., the heater panels 34, and in      conjunction therewith the present apparatus 10 provides means which      selectively modifies the cooking energy of heat emitted from the region or      area of each such heater panel 34 directly adjacent the fatty region of      chickens 12 as they are transported in the afore-described suspended state      through the cooking chamber 18, as generally indicated at 70 in FIGS. 3      and 4. In the preferred embodiment as illustrated, the cooking energy      modifying means is in the form of a generally planar wire mesh screen 72      suspended from an elongate support rod 74 which is affixed at its opposite      ends to the housing 16 at the lateral side of the entry and exit openings      20,22 adjacent the heater panels 34. The screen 72 is of a dimension in      height substantially corresponding to the fatty region of the chickens 12      and is of a sufficient length to extend substantially the full length of      the cooking chamber 18. In turn, the mounted disposition of the support      rod 74 is selected to interpose the screen 72 directly horizontally      between the fatty region of chickens 12 and the horizontally adjacent      region of each heater panel 34. </PAR><PAR>  In preliminary testing, it has been discovered that the screen 72      effectively prevents undesirable burning of the skin in the fatty region      of chickens cooked in the apparatus 10 while also achieving a more      thorough cooking of the underlying meat than is accomplished by the same      apparatus without the screen 72. The particular reasons and manner in      which the screen 72 accomplishes this result are unknown, but it is      believed that the screen 72 acts generally in the nature of a filter to      partially &quot;filter&quot; infrared rays emitted from the laterally adjacent      regions of the heater panels 34. It is accordingly contemplated that other      suitable web-like materials than the wire mesh screen 72 may operate      equally well to achieve the described results. </PAR><PAR>  It has also been discovered that the shoulder region of the chickens 12,      i.e. the region whereat the wings adjoin the breast, sometimes does not      cook as rapidly as the other meaty regions of the chickens. Accordingly,      to promote thorough cooking of the shoulder region and prevent      undercooking thereof, an upwardly angled metal reflector plate 68 is      mounted alongside the lowermost margins of the heater panels 34,36 at each      side of the cooking chamber 18 to reflect radiant heat energy emitted by      the opposing heater panels 34,36 back toward the shoulder region of the      chickens 12 to promote somewhat accelerated cooking of the chickens in      such shoulder region. </PAR><PAR>  The significant advantages and improvements of the present cooking      apparatus 10 and the cooking method it performs may thus be understood.      First, it is believed that the present cooking apparatus in its preferred      embodiment as described and illustrated represents the first apparatus by      which whole chickens can be broiled on a continuous automated conveyorized      basis with sufficiently reliable protection against undesirable burning      and sufficiently reliable cooking thoroughness to be commercially      acceptable for operation in a restaurant, institutional or like setting.      In comparison with conventional gas-fueled broiling grills of the type      currently in widespread use for the commercial broiling of meats and other      foods, the present cooking apparatus eliminates the need for constant      manual attention to the cooking process by skilled personnel with equal if      not greater consistency in the cooking quality, decreases the overall      cooking time required, substantially reduces the smoke, fumes and other      airborne effluent generated during the cooking process and, in turn,      substantially reduces the air flow and filtering capacity of the      associated exhaust system necessary for handling such effluent, all of      which makes the present cooking apparatus and method substantially more      energy and cost efficient to operate. As a result, differently seasoned      and flavored meats and other foods of the same or different types may be      boiled side-by-side without risk of cross-contamination of flavors due to      the significant reduction of smoke, fumes and flames fueled by rendered      grease and drippings characteristic of conventional gas-fueled grilling      apparatus. </PAR><PAR>  The present conveyor arrangement with its support forks makes the mounting      of chickens on the conveyor simple and ease to accomplish and facilitate      the automation of the cooking process by enabling whole chickens to be      transported through the apparatus in the open generally flat condition as      described, which heretofore has been utilized only when manually boiling      chickens on a conventional gas-fueled grill. In conjunction therewith, the      deflector plates of the discharge arrangement provide a simple yet      reliable means for removing chicken from the forks of the conveyor      arrangement without tearing or separation of the chicken carcass. Further,      the staggered arrangement of the heater panels together with the provision      of the reflector plates and the exhaust arrangement of the present      apparatus cooperate to advantageously maintain the air temperature within      the cooking chamber essentially constant without regard to the number and      frequency at which chickens are delivered into the cooking chamber,      whereby all chickens are substantially uniformly cooked whether the      apparatus is being operated infrequently at minimal capacity or      continuously at full capacity. </PAR><PAR>  It will therefore be readily understood by those persons skilled in the art      that the present invention is susceptible of a broad utility and      application. Many embodiments and adaptations of the present invention      other than those herein described, as well as many variations,      modifications and equivalent arrangements will be apparent from or      reasonably suggested by the present invention and the foregoing      description thereof, without departing from the substance or scope of the      present invention. Accordingly, while the present invention has been      described herein in detail in relation to its preferred embodiment, it is      to be understood that this disclosure is only illustrative and exemplary      of the present invention and is made merely for purposes of providing a      full and enabling disclosure of the invention. The foregoing disclosure is      not intended or to be construed to limit the present invention or      otherwise to exclude any such other embodiments, adaptations, variations,      modifications and equivalent arrangements, the present invention being      limited only by the claims appended hereto and the equivalents thereof. </PAR></DETD><CLMS> <STM>  We claim: </STM><NUM>  1. </NUM><PAR>  1.
