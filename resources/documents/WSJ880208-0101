That decision was a significant victory for genetic scientists under assault from nonsense environmentalists such as Jeremy Rifkin and his acolytes in the media, whose coverage of him has been selective.    Last month, a federal district court in Washington, D.C., issued a summary judgment, throwing out a highly publicized Rifkin lawsuit against the Agriculture Department. A search of two computer data bases turned up no coverage of the decision. The suit grew out of a well-publicized assault on scientist Saul Kit of Baylor College of Medicine, who developed a genetically altered vaccine to treat an epidemic of swine pseudorabies in 1986.    The Agriculture Department approved the licensing of Dr. Kit's vaccine, a decision that suddenly appeared in the news under the portentous headline, &quot;U.S. Quietly Approved the Sale of Genetically Altered Vaccine.&quot; &quot;This agency,&quot; Mr. Rifkin screamed through the news columns, &quot;ran roughshod over the entire regulatory process.&quot; What happened next was typical.    Agriculture Department officials suspended the vaccine's license. Baylor, instinctively sensitive to the prospect of losing federal research funding, ran Dr. Kit through an investigation. A House subcommittee held hearings. And the scientific community quaked in fear (silent fear) that the Kit episode might tighten the regulatory noose around genetic engineering.    Within two weeks the Agriculture Department reinstated the vaccine license. And, as always, Mr. Rifkin sued. As always, the suit attracted wide attention. This past Jan. 11, Judge Thomas Hogan dismissed the suit.    It is an important decision for anyone working in the field of biotechnology. Judge Hogan ruled that Mr. Rifkin lacked standing to challenge the vaccine's license. Standing, he said, requires evidence of specific, personalized injury, not a &quot;generalized grievance.&quot; As to Agriculture's handling of the vaccine, &quot;the Court notes that some of the testing 'deficiencies' {Mr. Rifkin} recounts reflect the nascency of the field of genetic engineering rather than truncated examination of the product by the agency.&quot;    This is at least the second large court defeat for Mr. Rifkin's anti-biotech flackery. Some 13 months ago, a little-noted decision by federal Judge Gerhard Gesell ruled that a Rifkin suit against the government's proposed biotech regulatory guidelines failed &quot;to present a justiciable case or controversy.&quot; He added pointedly that &quot;the injury requirement will not be satisfied simply because a chain of events can be hypothesized.&quot;    Scientists in biotechnology should take heart from these developments. The case against genetic engineering is so intellectually flawed that it isn't likely to survive examination by any seriously intentioned court. Moreover it is no small matter when a lawsuit can't even meet the current expansive theories of legal standing.    What remains now is for the rest of the scientific community to show more public backbone than it displayed when its colleagues Gary Strobel and Saul Kit were singled out for attack. Nor would it hurt if editors started assigning the Rifkin beat to whoever covers UFO sightings and the Loch Ness monster. </TEXT></DOC>
