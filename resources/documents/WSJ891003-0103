Eggum, a former Chicago Board of Trade member and soybean futures trader, pleaded guilty to two counts of mail fraud in federal court here and agreed to cooperate with a continuing federal investigation of futures trading fraud.    Mr. Eggum, 47 years old, admitted making two illegal soybean futures trades, one in May 1988 and one Jan. 4, just two weeks before the federal investigation became public.    Forty-five traders and one clerk on the Board of Trade and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange were charged with futures trading fraud in August, and all but a few have entered pleas. More indictments are expected as a result of the investigation, which used Federal Bureau of Investigation agents posing as traders in several futures trading pits on both exchanges.    Mr. Eggum faces a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison and a $500,000 fine as a result of his plea. But he is likely to receive a much lighter sentence in return for testifying against other indicted traders. </TEXT></DOC>
