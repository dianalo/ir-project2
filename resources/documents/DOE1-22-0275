<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-22-0275 </DOCNO><TEXT>Steady, laminar, axisymmetric and circumferentially uniform flow and heattransfer, including the effects of variable properties and buoyancy,have been modeled within a rotating disk chemical vapor deposition (CVD)reactor. The reactor is oriented vertically, with the hot, isothermal,spinning disk facing upward. The Navier-Stokes and energy equations havebeen solved for the carrier gas helium, at atmospheric pressure. Thesolutions have been obtained over a range of parameters which is of importancein CVD applications. The primary parameters are the ratio of the disktemperature to the free stream temperature T/sub {omega}//T/sub {infinity}/,the disk Reynolds number Re = r/sub d/{sup 2}{omega}/{nu}/sub {infinity}/,a mixed convection parameter Gr/Re/sup 3/2/ = g(1 - rho/sub {omega}//rho/sub{infinity}/)/({omega}{radical}{omega}{nu}/sub {infinity}/), the dimensionlessinlet velocity u/sub {infinity}//{radical}{omega}{nu}/sub {infinity}/,and two geometric parameters r{sub 0}/r/sub d/ and L/r/sub d/. Resultsare obtained for the velocity and the temperature fields and for theheat flux at the surface of the rotating disk. Comparisons are made withthe one-dimensional, variable properties (excluding buoyant effects),infinite rotating disk solutions of Pollard and Newman. Results are presentedin terms of a local Nusselt number. The potential uniformity of CVD inthis geometry can be inferred from the variation of the Nusselt numberover the surface of the rotating disk. The effects of buoyancy and thefinite size of the rotating disk within the cylindrical reactor evident.</TEXT></DOC>
