For months, candidates have been carefully positioningthemselves on the issues of abortion, the thrift crisis,campaign finance and the budget. But as the midterm campaignsget under way in earnest this week, candidates in bothparties are wondering how the current crisis will skewNovember's elections.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;Iraq is the big `X' factor,&quot; says Kevin Phillips, theRepublican political theorist. &quot;You have to know how manycasualties there are. You have to know what happens tohostages. You have to know what happens to oil prices. Andyou probably have to know what's happening with the stockmarket.&quot;   The political possibilities range from a move torally-'round-the-leader, which could help Republicans, to aneconomic recession, which could be devastating toRepublicans, to a situation where a standoff or a shootingwar overwhelms all other issues.   So far, candidates have approached the Middle East crisiswith deliberate caution, lining up behind the president andseldom voicing any second thoughts about the massivedeployment of U.S. soldiers and materiel to Saudi Arabia;only in a few scattered states have even the faintest hintsemerged of a debate over U.S. policy toward Saddam Hussein.But in the next nine weeks, as the contours of the Gulfcrisis become clearer, the issue will surely take on apolitical tint.   &quot;We have moved into the most volatile two months of anelection year in memory,&quot; says Paul Maslin, a Democraticpolitical pollster. &quot;It's foolhardy to think that there won'tbe any impact, but it's foolhardy to predict what the impactwill be.&quot;   The Gulf crisis becomes a wild card in a campaign thatalready has carried enormous political implications.   The fall elections will not only determine control of thegovernor's office in 35 states, including close contests inthree critical states -- Florida, Texas and California. Theyalso will play a substantial role in the struggle overabortion rights -- now primarily a state issue -- and willhave a direct effect on reapportionment and next year'sstruggle to redraw the nation's legislative-district lines.   &quot;These elections will have a lot to say about who servesin Congress in the next decade,&quot; says Alan Heslop, researchassociate at the Rose Institute of State and Local Governmentat California's Claremont McKenna College. &quot;Parties that losein November lose more than one election, because a party inpower can gerrymander itself into retaining a majority forthe rest of the decade.&quot;   Moreover, the fall elections are an important overture to1992, when President Bush presumably will seek a second termand when control of the Senate, now held with a 55-45 marginby the Democrats, could be at stake.   Democrats must do well in this fall's elections tobuttress themselves for 1992, when they defend 20 seats,including those of 11 freshmen, many of whom won by extremelysmall margins. The Republicans feel that if they can pick upat least two or three seats, they can win control of theSenate in the presidential election year of 1992.   Meanwhile, as the nation girds for possible war andrecession, the candidates are worrying whether their campaignmessages might seem out of sync with public concerns.   &quot;The situation is forcing people to reconsider theirstrategies,&quot; says Rep. Beryl Anthony of Arkansas, chairman ofthe Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. &quot;The budgetand the Sandamp;L crisis are off the front page, so a lot of adsand speeches all of a sudden seem out of context.&quot;   At the same time, a number of groups that saw the fallelections as a critical juncture are troubled that the publicwon't get a chance to focus on issues such as abortion. Ontelevision, in newspapers and on the street corner, Iraq iscrowding out nearly every other issue.   &quot;This crisis is of very great importance, but I'm worriedabout the distraction it causes,&quot; says Kate Michelman,executive director of the National Abortion Rights ActionLeague. &quot;People aren't talking about change at the SupremeCourt -- a factor that is going to affect the fabric of ourlives for many years to come. And interest in major domesticissues has diminished.&quot;   Burke Balch, legislative director of the National Right toLife Committee, believes that the Iraq crisis might helpanti-abortion candidates. Abortion-rights activists &quot;aren'tgoing to retain their single-issue voters on abortion --their supporters are interested in a lot of issues, not onlyabortion -- but we'll retain ours,&quot; he says.   For the time being at least, many analysts feel thatdeepening public concern about events in the Persian Gulfmight benefit incumbents who otherwise were facing the threatof an anti-Washington backlash. Though the crisis hasaccelerated the economic slide, it has also kept incumbentsinvolved in the summer's major news story in a way thatchallengers can't match, and it has diverted attention fromanti-incumbent issues such as the budget standoff and the Sandamp;Lbailout.   &quot;People may not be willing to make quite as many changes,&quot;says Celinda Lake, a Democratic political pollster. &quot;Andthere seem to be bigger issues to talk about than whetheryour representative in Congress took an honorarium or not.&quot;   This year's struggles for the governor's office have thepotential to overshadow the congressional elections. Nowhereis a gubernatorial race more important than in California,where GOP Sen. Pete Wilson and Democrat Dianne Feinstein, theformer San Francisco mayor, are running even in the polls;the winner will preside over reapportionment of the nation'slargest state. As a result of this year's census, Californiais expected to add seven House seats to the 47 it currentlyholds.   At the same time, races on the state level will determinecontrol of important state legislatures, including the NewYork state Senate, now dominated by Republicans, and bothhouses in Pennsylvania, where Republicans control the Senateand Democrats control the House.   In races for national offices, Republicans hope they canknock off Democratic incumbents in Hawaii, Iowa and RhodeIsland. They expect to hold almost all their own seats,including in North Carolina, where, in perhaps the nation'shottest race, Jesse Helms is facing a tough challenge fromformer Democratic Mayor Harvey Gantt of Charlotte.   Little change is expected in the House, where there-election rate in the past decade was 94.5%. The Democratshope to add marginally to their 62-seat majority. Republicanstake comfort in the argument that the party holding the WhiteHouse normally loses seats in midterm elections;nevertheless, such a loss would underscore the party'sweakness in House races. Even if they held their own,Republicans would return with only 176 seats.   As the campaign season gets under way, Republicans areviewing the president's high support ratings with caution.&quot;Loss of life {in a Gulf war} could make a big difference,&quot;warns Linda DiVall, a GOP political consultant. &quot;And when youcombine the economic uncertainties, there's real volatility.These factors could cause a lot of short-term surges on voterdecisions, and they could either reward or punish thepresident's party.&quot;   ---                       What's at Stake                                                                                                          The following offices are being contested in this fall'selections:                                                                                                                                        CURRENTLY HELD BY                          -------------------------------                          DEMOCRATS           REPUBLICANS                                                                                                        Governor                   19                     16 U.S. Senator               17                     18 U.S. Representative       258                    176 Control of state houses    33                     11 Control of both chambers   25                      9   ---                        Redrawing the Map                                                                                                          Preliminary population estimates from the U.S. Census showlikely changes in the size of states' delegations to theHouse.
