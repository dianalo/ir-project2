(Act) The proposedrule is intended to reflect the amendments made by that Act to section206 of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 by providingfor:  1. Time frames and mechanisms for the resolution of disagreements concerningthe values of the lands involved in an exchange, unless otherwise agreedby parties to the exchange;  2. Appraisal standards that reflect nationally recognized appraisal standards; 3. Adjustment of the relative values involved in an exchange transactionin order to compensate a party or parties to the exchange for assumingcosts, or other responsibilities or requirements, which would ordinarilybe borne by the other party or parties;4. Exchanges of lands of approximately equal value when the appraised valuesof the public and nonfederal lands are within 5 percent, the value of thepublic lands to be conveyed is $150,000 or less, and when the determinationof approximately equal value can be made without a formal appraisal onthe basis of a statement of value prepared by a qualified appraiser, andapproved by the authorized officer;5. Waiver of cash equalization payment where the amount to be waived isno more than 3 percent of the value of the lands being transferred outof Federal ownership or $15,000, whichever is less;6. Automatic segregation of public lands proposed for exchange from theoperation of the public land and mineral laws, for a period not to exceed5 years;7. Automatic segregation of nonfederal lands acquired in an exchange fromoperation of the public land and mineral laws, for 90 days from the dateof acceptance of title;8. Simultaneous transfer of titles, unless mutually agreed otherwise; and9. Automatic transfer of jurisdiction when lands acquired by exchange arewithin national land systems estabished by Congress.The proposed rule also provides for land pooling agreements with governmentalagencies and other parties. These agreements would create separate poolsof public and nonfederal lands from which individual tracts could be conveyedwithout simultaneous title transfers. A ledger would be maintained to tabulateeach of the transactions and record the resulting balances. The accountwould be equalized every two years, or at the expiration of the agreement,whichever comes first.Finally, to facilitate land exchanges involving minerals, the rulemakingallows the parties to an exchange to reserve the minerals, exchange mineralsof equal value, or reserve a 25-year royalty.In the interest of uniformity, the Bureau of Land Management has consultedwith the U.S. Forest in developing this proposed rule. In addition, a Noticeof Intent to Propose Rulemaking was published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on November 14, 1988 (53 FR 45782). The Noticeof Intent requested the public to provide information or make recommendationswhich would assist the Bureau in developing regulations on the agreementto initiate an exchange, the bargaining process, appraisal standards, adjustmentof relative values for compensation purposes, and the definitions of approximatelyequal value, statement of value, and qualified appraiser.The Notice of Intent drew comments from 13 sources: two from State governments,one from local government, six from private organizations, two from publicland grazing associations, one from a public land grazing advisory boardand one from the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation. A summary ofthe comments and corresponding responses are as follows:<ITAG tagnum="84">Agreement to Initiate an Exchange</ITAG><T3>Comments: </T3>One commenter recommended that all exchanges be initiatedat the State Director level and tied to specific time frames. Another commenterstated that the agreement to initiate an exchange should be in the formof a letter of understanding that describes the land parcels to be exchangedand sets forth the terms and conditions relative to the appraisal process.It was also suggested that the exchange process be as unstructured as possibleand allow the parties to an exchange maximum flexibility within the frameworkof the Federal Land Exchange Facilitation Act.<T3>Response: </T3>The Bureau believes that all exchange proposals shouldbe discussed initially with the BLM District Manager or Area Manager forthe District or Resource Area in which the public lands which are the subjectof the exchange are located. These are the Bureau officials most familiarwith the properties involved, i.e., land status, planning and environmentalconsiderations, would be directly responsible for coordinating and processingthe exchanges.The exchange process has been designed around a written, nonbinding statementof present intent, called in the Act an ``agreement to initiate an exchange.''This agreement may be terminated by either party, without cost or penalty,at any time, or it may be modified by mutual agreement during the exchangeprocess. The purpose of this agreement is to establish a working relationshipbetween the parties by (1) delineating various responsibilities and informationalrequirements, (2) identifying applicable procedures, and (3) fixing timeframes and mechanisms to complete each stage of the exchange process.<ITAG tagnum="84">Process of Bargaining</ITAG><T3>Comments:</T3> Several comments addressed the bargaining process. Onecommenter believed that this ``smacks of horse trading'' that could leadto potential problems and should only be used sparingly at the WashingtonOffice level. Another stated that bargaining, without some guidelines and/orrestrictions relative to value, would not be in the public's best interest.It was also pointed out that the process of bargaining would serve as animportant mechanism for resolving disputes when there are legitimate differencesin appraisal assumptions, approaches to value, or interpretation of datathat could not be resolved through the appraisal process.<T3>Response:</T3> In lieu of arbitration, bargaining or some other processmay be used to resolve disputes concerning the appraised values of thelands being considered for exchange. As indicated in andSection; 2201.2-2(c)of this proposed rule, the parties may meet to discuss issues relatingto differences in the appraised values of the lands involved in an exchange.These issues may be resolved through mutual agreement, or the parties mayinvolve an impartial third party to either mediate or propose a solution.Any agreement, including the rationale supporting the values of the landsto be exchanged, must be in writing and made part of the administrativerecord.<ITAG tagnum="84">Appraisal Standards</ITAG><T3>Comments:</T3> Several commenters recommended adoption of nationallyrecognized appraisal standards. One reviewer recommended that the appraisalstandards should be consistent with standards of nationally recognizedappraisal organizations such as the American Institute of Real Estate Appraisers,the Society of Real Estate Appraisers, and the American Society of FarmManagers and Rural Appraisers.Four comments were directed at the publication ``Uniform Appraisal Standardsfor Federal Land Aquisitions'' (Department of Justice, 1973 ed.). Two commenterswere unsure that the publication was applicable to exchanges authorizedunder the Federal Land Policy and Management Policy Act of 1976. One Stateagency suggested that it not be used, or at least not be the primary standardfor exchange appraisals. A private land exchange company expressed theview that the standards were primarily applicable to Federal acquisitionby condemnation. They suggested that whatever standards are adopted shouldbe equally applied to both the public and nonfederal lands.It was also recommended that two separate appraisals be completed on boththe public and nonfederal lands proposed for exchange, and that the appraisalrules of the Departments of the Interior and Agriculture be identical orat least very similar.<T3>Response:</T3> The Act requires this rulemaking to reflect nationallyrecognized appraisal standards, to the extent appropriate. These standardsare reflected in andSection; 2201.4 of this proposed rule. These standardsincorporate, as appropriate, the ``Uniform Appraisal Standards for FederalLand Acquisitions'', as amended, an Interagency Land Acquisition Conferencepublication (May 1973) and the ``Uniform Standards of Professional AppraisalPractice'', as published by the Appraisal Foundation. The standards applyto the public and nonfederal lands involved in an exchange.The proposed rule does not require two separate appraisals of the publicand nonfederal lands although, as discussed below, all appraisals are subjectto review by an agency appraiser. The complexity of the appraisal assignment,the working relationship established between the exchange parties, andthe preliminary estimate of the values of the lands involved, may indicatethe desirability of having a second appraisal. Circumstances requiringmore than one appraisal will vary with each exchange transaction. Thesecircumstances may include lands having various encumbrances affecting title,possessing commercially developable timber or mineral resources, or instanceswhere the highest and best use may be questionable. In addition, the uniquenessof the lands appraised or the lack of relevant market information for analysismay warrant a second appraisal.Public comments are specifically requested as to whether and under whatcircumstances more than one appraisal should be required. The input providedwill be helpful in the preparation of the final rule or of instructionalguidance that may be developed to assist the parties involved in an exchange.As indicated in andSection; 2201.4-7 of this proposed rule, all appraisalsprepared for an exchange transaction will be reviewed by an agency appraiser.The purpose of this review is to determine whether the appraisal reportis logical and supports the estimate of market value. The authorized officermust concur in the reviewer's statement before the estimate of market valuebecomes the agency's approved value for the lands proposed for exchange.The Bureau of Land Management and the U.S. Forest Service have met concerningthe development of appraisal standards. There are some minor differences.These differences reflect various agency exchange authorities and proceduresfor developing and implementing policies. However, both the Bureau andthe Forest Service have relied on the aforementioned publications to attainconsistency with nationally recognized appraisal standards.<ITAG tagnum="84">Adjustment of Relative Values</ITAG><T3>Comments:</T3> Several comments were received on Section 206(f)(2)(B)(ii)of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act. Most agreed that compensationshould be allowed for various costs paid by the nonfederal parties. Onecommenter recommended that the costs associated with exploration, development,and marketing of coal reserves deemed no longer mineable as a result ofthe Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 should be consideredpart of the value of an exchange property. It was also suggested that thecosts and services be limited to those specified in the Act, or that thenonfederal party be compensated for incurring extraordinary expenses uniqueto Federal land transactions. This would include costs associated withFederal land appraisals, environmental analyses, cultural surveys, mineralexaminations or other requirements in order to comply with laws, regulationsand policies applicable to Federal land exchanges.<T3>Response: </T3>The Act and proposed rule list but do not limit thevarious costs that can be incurred or services that can be rendered inmaking adjustments to the relative values involved in an exchange transaction.Previously incurred costs associated with exploration, development, andmarketing of coal reserves deemed no longer mineable under the SurfaceMining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 are not considered appropriatefor value adjustment purposes. However, the information derived from theseactivities may be taken into account when estimating the market value ofthe lands involved in an exchange. Section 2201.1(c)(7) of the rulemaking would allow the exchange partiesto agree, within reason, upon the type and amount of compensation to becredited to either party. The authorized officer must ensure that the amountof each adjustment is reasonable and accurately reflects the approximatevalue of the costs incurred, the services provided, or any responsibilityor requirements assumed. The total amount of all such adjustments and anycash equalization payment may not exceed 25 percent of the preadjustmentvalue of the lands to be conveyed out of Federal ownership. <ITAG tagnum="84">Approximately Equal Value </ITAG><T3>Comments: </T3>A wide range of comments was received concerning thecriterion of ``approximately equal value''. One State agency commentedthat its Enabling Act would prevent the use of approximately equal valueif the value of the Federal lands in the exchange was less than the valueof the State lands. Another State agency commented that it is a good toolfor moving small tracts of low value in a relatively short period of time.Two commenters felt that the difference in value should not exceed 10 percentwhile another stated that 5 percent would be reasonable for most appraisals.One reviewer recommended that approximately equal value should never beused in consummating land exchanges.<T3>Response: </T3>The proposed rule defines ``approximately equal value''as occurring when the value of the nonfederal lands is within 5 percentof the value of the public lands being exchanged. The determination ofapproximately equal value must be based on a statement of value preparedby a qualified appraiser and approved by the authorized officer. In addition,the criterion of approximately equal value can only be applied to exchangesin which the value of the lands to be conveyed out of Federal ownershipis no more than $150,000. This provision of the regulations would facilitate smaller exchanges involvingeither intermingled lands within a property ownership or land adjustmentson the edges of currently blocked landholdings. Its application would belimited to those circumstances in which the qualified appraiser would appraiseproperties that are similar in location, use, size, and other physicalattributes. For these reasons, a 5 percent difference in value is consideredto be reasonable and attainable. <ITAG tagnum="84">Statement of Value </ITAG><T3>Comments: </T3>Four comments were received concerning statement ofvalue. One State agency commented that it could not use a statement ofvalue if it was something less than an appraisal. Others suggested informationand the minimum amount of support data that should be included in the statement.An appraiser stated he did not believe that the use of a statement of valuewould result in a significant savings in time or costs. Another commenterfelt that the document would be highly efficient for in-house land managersto accomplish land adjustments in half the time normally required whenusing narrative appraisals. <T3>Response: </T3>The statement of value would consist of a written reportprepared by a qualified appraiser and approved by the authorized officer.This type of appraisal could only be requested when (1) the estimated valueof the lands to be transferred from Federal ownership is not more than$150,000, and (2) the lands appraised are similar in location, acreage,use and physical attributes. The statement of value would comply with theminimum report standards for an appraisal as provided in andSection; 2201.4-6of this title. It would also contain the appraiser's analysis and estimateof value for both the public and nonfederal lands. <ITAG tagnum="84">Qualified Appraiser</ITAG><T3>Comments: </T3>Several comments were received concerning the qualificationsof an appraiser. One commenter suggested that the person preferably bean accredited member of a nationally recognized appraisal organizationthat meets the membership requirements of the Appraisal Foundation. OneState agency recommended adoption of qualification standards developedby the Appraisal Foundation and included reference to proposed State legislationconcerning licensing standards. Another State agency was concerned thatthe standards may be too high and could result in the elimination of agencyappraisers. The same commenter also suggested that when minerals are involvedthe appraiser should have a baccalaureate in the earth sciences. Finally,one reviewer suggested that the existing qualification standards shouldremain in effect. <T3>Response: </T3>As indicated in andSection; 2201.4-1 of this rulemaking,the qualifications of an appraiser were expanded to incorporate the majorityof recommendations made in the comments. Consideration was also given toongoing efforts by State legislatures and national appraiser organizationsto develop appraiser qualifications. <ITAG tagnum="84">Resource Values</ITAG><T3>Comments: </T3>Several commenters suggested that appraised values includehistoric, scenic, and other intangible qualities such as recreational potential,wildlife habitat, and economic development needs for urban expansion. Althoughmany of them agreed that it may not be feasible to set economic valueson these qualities, they suggested that appraisers should, to the extentpossible, consider these intangible qualities in estimating market value.<T3>Response: </T3>Market value is the standard for estimating value. Theappraiser's responsibility is to estimate what the propery would sell forin the real estate market as of the date of appraisal. To the extent thathistoric, wildlife, recreation, scenic qualities or economic and otherresources values influence market value, these values are included in theestimates of appraised values. Appraisers would use comparable sales andanalyses which reflect these qualities and attributes. <ITAG tagnum="84">Concluding Remarks</ITAG>In summary, the proposed rule prescribes an exchange process that willenhance decisionmaking and expedite viable exchanges. The process is basedon a nonbinding ``agreement to initiate an exchange'' that can be unilaterallyterminated or mutually modified. This agreement would establish an informalworking relationship between the parties, and set forth time frames, responsibilities,and information requirements for exchange transactions. Other elementsof the process are intended to simplify and speed up the consummation ofproposed changes. The proposed rule also allows the public to participate in the land exchange,decisionmaking process. In the early stages of the process, the authorizedofficer will publish a notice of initiation if the exchange proposal appearsto be acceptable. After the authorized officer completes all necessarystudies to determine whether the proposed exchange is in compliance withthe regulations and is consistent with the Burean of Land Management policiesand programs, the authorized officer will issue a notice of realty action.Both notices will be published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>and provide the opportunity for public comment.The principal authors of this proposed rule are David Cavanaugh, RogerTaylor, and Bob Schrott of the BLM Washington Office (WO), with assistancefrom Herb Olson (WO), Paul McNutt (WO), Jim Binando (Montana State Office),Bob Archibald (Arizona State Office), Yolanda Vega (Albuquerque DistrictOffice), Marla Bohl (Nevada State Office), and Mike Pool of the Divisionof Legislation and Regulatory Management (WO).It has been determined that this rulemaking does not constitute a majorFederal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment,and that no detailed statement pursuant to section 102(2)(C) of the NationalEnvironmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C)), is required.The Department of the Interior has determined that this document is nota major rule under Executive Order 12291 and certifies this document willnot have a significant economic effect on a substantial number of smallentities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 <T3>et seq.</T3>). Additionally, the proposed rule would not cause a takingof private property under Executive Order 12630. The provision for collection of information contained in this rule havebeen submitted to the Office of Management and Budget for approval as requiredby 44 U.S.C. 3501 <T3>et seq. </T3>The collection of information will not be required untilit has been approved by the Office of Management and Budget. Public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimatedto average 4 hours per response, including the time for reviewing instructions,searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed,and completing and reviewing the collection of information. Send commentsregarding this burden estimate or any other aspect of this collection ofinformation, including suggestions for reducing the burden, to the Divisionof Information Resources Management, Bureau of Land Management, 1800 CStreet, NW., Premier Building, Room 208, Washington, DC 20240; and theOffice of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management andBudget, Washington, D.C. 20503. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects</ITAG>43 CFR Part 2090Public lands-classification, Public lands-mineral resources.43 CFR Part 2200Administrative practices and procedures, National forests, Public lands-classification.Under the authority of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976,as amended (43 U.S.C. 1715, 1716 and 1732), part 2200, group 2200, subchapterB, chapter II of title 43 of the Code of Federal Regulations is proposedto be amended as follows: <ITAG tagnum="52">PART 2200_EXCHANGES_GENERAL PROCEDURES_[AMENDED]</ITAG>1.
