Randomfields provide a convenient means to model phenomena characterized byerratic fluctuations throughout time and/or space. Conditional simulationsmay be used to provide typical variations of values within these randomfields when some data points have specified values. A principal purposeof this study is to develop methods that achieve conditional simulationwith a minimum of computer time and storage. Toward this end, representationtheory for homogeneous and/or isotropic random fields is reviewed andapplied to develop methods to simulate Gaussian fields on lattices andunderlying coordinate systems that reflect the inherent geometrical propertiesof the random fields. Included are methods for rectangular, polar, andcylindrical coordinate systems. A Taylor series interpolation scheme,and the concept of non-Cartesian homogeneity are also introduced. Resultsshow these representations and resulting simulations may be modifiedto reflect the conditional stochastic properties of random fields whendata are available.</TEXT></DOC>
