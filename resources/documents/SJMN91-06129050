The governor wants to cut $2 billion from the schools budget andthe educators are wringing their hands.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Editorial  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  PASS SARATOGA'S SCHOOL TAXMEASURE A SAVES PROGRAMS, REPAIRS BUILDINGSAND NEEDS SUPPORT OF VOTERS ALL AGES  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Editorials  </MEMO><TEXT>     In Saratoga, they're doing more than wringing hands and praying for abailout from the state. They're attempting to pass a tax measure that wouldenable the Saratoga Union School District to repair its aging schoolbuildings, restore library services and save important programs that are aboutto be cut.;    If Measure A passes June 4, every property owner in thedistrict would be taxed $179 a year for four years. Property owners who are atleast 65 years old would be eligible for an exemption. The tax would raise$800,000 a year.;    Saratoga has an outstanding elementary school system, butit is not what it used to be. Since 1978, a combination of decliningenrollment and Proposition 13 has forced the district to sell off schoolbuildings, cut programs, reduce administrative staff and delay buildingmaintenance.;    As a result, the district has 30-year-old buildings badly inneed of roof repair, asbestos removal and earthquake reinforcement. It islooking at cutting innovative programs such as the back-to-back readingprogram, which offers extra help for kids learning to read. And still it facesa deficit of $500,000 this year and twice that next year.;    Most parents whohave children in the Saratoga schools understand the need for Measure A. Butthis tax requires a two-thirds vote to pass, so it's important for residentswho don't have school-age children to support it, too.;    We don't like theexemption for people over 65. We think people of all ages should understandthat a strong school system strengthens their community and, ultimately, theentire society.;    But if they can't think that globally, let them not forgethow the reputation of the Saratoga schools enhances their own propertyvalues.;    In that light, $179 is a bargain.  </TEXT><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910508  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Wednesday  </DAY><MONTH>  May  </MONTH><PG.COL>  6B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  357  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Wednesday May 8, 199100129050,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
