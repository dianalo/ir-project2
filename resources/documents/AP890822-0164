Luis CarlosGalan. It was the latest suggestion foreign mercenaries are involvedin Colombia's drug-related bloodshed.   Earlier accounts in the news media have said there wereindications British, Israeli and South African mercenaries weretraining assassination teams for the drug cartels.   Galan, the nation's leading presidential candidate, was shot onFriday at a political rally. The killing prompted an emergencydeclaration by authorities and a crackdown on the powerful drugcartels.   According to the conservative Bogota newspaper El Siglo, policeare investigating what appears to be an Arab link to Galan's murder.   It quoted an unidentified witness on Monday as saying that justbefore the killing the man who shot Galan was heard speaking to anaccomplice in a foreign language, and the killer left behind at thescene a copy of the Egyptian newspaper Al Ahram.   El Siglo carried a photograph of the newspaper, dated June 3,1989.   Police said the drug cartel based in the industrial city ofMedellin, the world center for cocaine trafficking, had offered $1million for Galan's assassination. An attempt to kill him on Aug. 4was frustrated by authorities.   Military and police authorities also say the drug cartels areusing some of their billion-dollar profits to arm and train squadsof hired assassins in a loose association with right-wing extremists.   On April 10, local newspapers cited national police documents assaying that Israeli and British mercenaries were providing trainingto the death squads at camps in a rural northeastern Colombia.   Shortly after those reports a national television chain broadcasta video tape it said was received from the death squads. It showedmen in military-style uniforms training with high-powered automaticweapons. The video included an interview with a purported trainer,who spoke Spanish with a foreign accent and kept his back turned tothe cameara.   In the United States, NBC Nightly News on Monday showed videotapeit said was obtained from Colombian television of ``drug assassinsin training at a secret base camp somewhere in Colombia.'' It saidthe video was made available by the cocaine cartel, ``apparently asa kind of video warning of what the cartel would do if thegovernment moved against it.''   The reporter, Brian Ross, said Colombian and American authoritiesidentified some of the trainers shown in the video as ``Israelis andSouth Africans, former military men now training Colombian drugarmies in assassination and terror techniques.''   On Aug. 13, the Sunday Times of London reported that Britishmercenaries are being used by a drug cartel based in the city ofCali that is engaged in a bloody, 18-month-old feud with theMedellin cartel.   The newspaper said British mercenaries were hired to killMedellin cartel leader Pablo Escobar by bombing a rural ranch heowns from two helicopters. It said one helicopter was too weighteddown with arms and crashed on June 4, and the other turned back.   The paper said that upon learning of the attempt, Escobarlaunched a similar plot to kill Cali cartel boss Gilberto RodriguezOrijuela, but mechanical failure forced the Escobar helicopter tomake an emergency landing July 12.   Authorities have confirmed accidents involving helicopters on thedates cited in the reports. In both cases, police pilots wereinvolved, officials said. In the July 12 incident, authoritiesreported finding $259,000 in cash abroad the aircraft.   But officials cast doubt on the report. ``The newspaper reportsevents that really have taken place but it frames them in a novelsituation that goes beyond qualification,'' said police Gen.
