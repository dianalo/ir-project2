Rocky Mountain State, with assets of $17.6 million, was closed Friday by state banking authorities, and the FDIC was named receiver. City Bank will assume about $16.3 million in 7,037 depository accounts, and will purchase loans and other assets of the failed bank for $10.7 million. The FDIC will advance about $4.9 million to the assuming bank, and will retain assets of the failed bank with a book value of $6.9 million.
