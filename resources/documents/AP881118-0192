The lawsuit filed Thursday by Met Life, one of the biggest U.S.insurance companies and a major holder of RJR Nabisco long-termbonds, alleges the risky $20.7 billion plan unfairly depressed thevalue of those bonds.   The suit came one day after ITT Corp. sued RJR Nabisco forrelated reasons.   Met Life's action was considered significant because the insurerhas made profitable investments in other debt-financed takeoversituations, but is now re-evaluating that strategy in light of theunprecedented RJR Nabisco deal.   ``I'd say bond purchasers, like investors in general, may belooking at this activity as different from activities in the past,''David Versfelt, a lawyer who specializes in creditor litigation,said in reaction to the lawsuit. ``We're in a new world and peopleare going to look at things differently.''   At a news conference, Met Life President John J. Creedon accusedRJR Nabisco's top managers of recklessly proceeding with a plan thatif successful not only would enrich them and their investmentbankers, but also would quadruple the company's debt to $23 billion.The prospect of that huge new debt has raised concern about thecompany's ability to pay existing bond obligations.   Creedon said such concerns already had wiped $1 billion in marketvalue from RJR Nabisco corporate bonds, including $40 million inlosses for Met Life's own portfolio of $340 million in Nabiscolong-term debt securities. The lawsuit demands restitution of thoselosses.   ``RJR has gone to the well of public debt for many years, and nowthey're trying to poison it,'' he said.   Officials at RJR Nabisco's headquarters in Atlanta declined tocomment on the suit, saying the company did not comment on pendinglitigation.   The suit names as defendants both RJR Nabisco and its chiefexecutive officer, F. Ross Johnson. Johnson stunned the financeworld last month by proposing a management-led leveraged buyout ofthe nation's 19th largest industrial company, which makes itemsranging from Winston cigarettes to Ritz crackers.   A leveraged buyout is an increasingly popular high-financetransaction in which an acquirer uses borrowed money to buy allstock of a company and repays the debt through the company'searnings, by asset sales or a combination of both.   Such LBOs often provide staggering profits for owners of atarget's stock, leaving a much smaller, privately-owned companysaddled with a much higher debt load.   The size and complexity of RJR Nabisco's planned buyout, combinedwith the uncertain outlook for interest rates and the economy, haveincited criticisms that debt-financed takeovers may have reached anexcessive, indiscriminate pace.   The Met Life lawsuit contended the RJR Nabisco proposal has``already resulted in a loss of confidence in the market forinvestment grade obligations of America's leading companies, and iswidely recognized as a threat to the integrity of our financialmarkets.''   Creedon told reporters he believes the frenzied level ofleveraged buyouts could subvert America's capital formation system,and that it warrants federal government scrutiny.   That is another reason Met Life felt compelled to take legalaction, he said.   ``It's time to step back and look at the process,'' he said.``We're trying to send a message here.''   Responding to reporters' questions, Creedon conceded Met Lifeitself had been an early investor in some leveraged buyouts, some ofwhich have done well. He also said Met Life owns 186,000 shares ofRJR Nabisco stock, which has gained about $5 million in value sincethe leveraged buyout plans were disclosed in October.   ``Of course what happened is the stock went up,'' he said. ``Butwhether or not it offsets the losses in bonds, those are twodifferent interests.''   Creedon also said Met Life was re-evaluating its investmentposition regarding debt-financed takeovers. ``We will carefullyconsider LBOs in the future with a more jaundiced eye,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
