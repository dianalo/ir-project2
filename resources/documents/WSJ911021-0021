The agreement concerns Hanson PLC's bid for constructionand building materials group Beazer PLC. Under terms of the#351.4 million ($601.6 million) offer announced last month,Hanson is proposing a combination of cash and warrants forHanson shares in return for Beazer shares.</LP><TEXT>   Both companies are based in Britain, and there is no legalobligation on Hanson to make the bid available on the sameterms to Beazer shareholders outside the U.K. However, asimultaneous, unified offer was needed because the bid'ssuccess depends on a positive response from Beazershareholders in both countries. Beazer has a large proportionof its assets and about 45% of its shareholders in the U.S.Without the participation of U.S. shareholders, Hanson wouldrisk failing to win a 51% majority.   Until now, practically the only example of a simultaneousbid in both countries was Ford Motor Co.'s bid for Jaguar,the British automobiles manufacturer, in the late 1980s. Butin that case, two separate offers were made under therequirements of each jurisdiction.   Lawyers and officials familiar with the operation said theagreement on a singleoffer document paves the way for othersimilar transactions.   The agreement responds to growing concern in Washingtonthat U.S. investors might otherwise find themselves at adisadvantage in takeovers and mergers involving Europeancompanies.   Aside from Jaguar, in past bids affecting U.K. companieswith U.S. shareholders, acquiring companies have mostlyignored U.S. investors because of the complexities ofcomplying with U.S. securities laws.   To enable Hanson to make a simultaneous offer on bothsides of the Atlantic, Britain's Panel on Takeovers andMergers and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission hadto resolve issues in several areas where their securitieslegislations differ.   One key point concerned the period during whichshareholders will be able to withdraw shares they havepreviously tendered in response to the bid.   Under U.S. rules, shareholders can withdraw at any timeuntil an offer is declared closed, after which the terms ofthe bid are no longer applicable. Under British rules, bycontrast, shareholders can withdraw only while a bid remainsconditional on the bidder obtaining a majority holding. Oncea bid is declared unconditional, shareholders who havetendered their shares can no longer withdraw.   In the case of Hanson's bid, the SEC and the U.K.takeovers panel agreed on a compromise aligning rules in theU.S. with U.K. practice. Under terms set out in the offerdocument, shareholders will have the right during a periodknown as the &quot;initial offer period&quot; to withdraw any tenderedsecurities. On expiration of this period once sufficientshares have been tendered to give Hanson a majority, the bidwill go into what has been termed a &quot;subsequent offer period&quot;during which no withdrawals are permitted.   As a counterpart, the U.K. panel agreed to modify someU.K. rules. One of the most significant modifications is aslightly shorter deadline for payment to shareholders inreturn for shares accepted under the bid.</TEXT></DOC>
