Role</HEAD><BYLINE>By KENNETH L. WHITING</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Negotiations resumed Monday on endingthe decade-old civil war in Cambodia, with Australia's proposal foran interim U.N. administration the main topic of discussion.   None of the parties directly involved in the talks registered anexplicit rejection of the United Nations playing a major role untilelections are held, said Ali Alatas, foreign minister of Indonesia.   Attending the latest talks are representatives of theVietnamese-sponsored government of Cambodia; the three guerrillafactions; Vietnam; Laos; France; Australia; and the Association ofSoutheast Asian Nations, consisting of Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia,the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand.   In an address opening the conference, Alatis said there wasbroad support for the Australian proposal. He said the fivepermanent members of the U.N. Security Council _ The United States,Soviet Union, China, Britain and France _ had endorsed greater U.N.participation.   No quick agreement was expected on the proposal, especiallyafter reports reached Jakarta that thousands of Vietnamese troopshad secretly returned to Cambodia to support premier Hun Sen's armyagainst the guerrillas.   Vietman claimed all its force withdrew in late September afternearly 11 years of occupation, but guerrilla leaders denied it.   Three guerrilla groups are in an alliance led by Prince NorodomSihanouk: the prince's own followers and the People's NationalLiberation Front of former Premier Son Sann, both non-Communist,and the Khmer Rouge, whose brutal regime was ousted by theVietnamese invasion of December 1978.   In Jakarta, Son Sann said of the Vietnamese: ``Everybody knowsthey are still in Cambodia, and when Phnom Penh troops fight us inwestern Cambodia, there are many Vietnamese troops among them.''   Khieu Samphan, nominal leader of the Khmer Rouge, said 20,000Vietnamese troops had slipped back into Cambodia. The Vietnameserefused to let the United Nations verify their withdrawal inSeptember.   ``We have returned (home) and never come back,'' ForeignMinister Nguyen Co Thach said Monday in Jakarta.   The latest conference is to run through Wednesday.   Foreign Minister Gareth Evans said the Australian plan for a keyU.N. role was an elaboration of earlier suggestions by PrinceSihanouk, Cambodia's former ruler, and Rep. Stephen Solarz, D-N.Y.,who heads the House subcommittee on Asian and Pacific affairs.   ``Foreign troops must leave Cambodia and not come back; the U.N.can monitor and verify this,'' Evans said. ``Foreign arms supplyand military assistance has to stop; the U.N. can monitor andverify this. There has to be a cease-fire and associated measuresso that hostilities do not start again; the U.N. can supervise,monitor and verify this.''   China arms the guerrilla coalition and the Soviet Union providesweapons to Vietnam and the Hun Sen government. The United Stateshas shipped non-lethal supplies to the guerrillas led by Sihanoukand Son Sann.   Evans said the United Nations ``should be involved in the civiladministration of Cambodia in the transitional period leading up tofree and fair elections. ... This central idea has been agreed byvirtually everyone to whom we have spoken. Even that one Cambodianparty which has not accepted it has publicly stated that it has notrejected it.''   His reference appeared to be to the Khmer Rouge.   In addition to U.N. administrators, Evans proposed a SupremeNational Council to be ``the repository of Cambodian nationalsovereignty and national unity during the transitional period. .. .Membership of the Supreme National Council could be made up ofindividuals from all the Cambodian parties serving in theirpersonal capacity as `prominent cambodians.'''   Other provisions of the Australian proposal would dismantle theHun Sen government and declare Cambodia's U.N. seat vacant. It isheld by the guerrilla coalition.   Rafeeuddin Ahmed, who is representing Secretary-General JavierPerez de Cuellar in Jakarta, said the United Nations ``would beprepared, in the framework of a comprehensive settlement, tocontribute to the implementation of the agreements reached ... ifthat were the wish of all parties directly concerned.''   ``The secretary-general has stressed, however, that the mandatewhich may ultimately be entrusted to the United Nations must bewell defined, realistic and practicable,'' he said.   Foreign Minister Roland Dumas is serving as co-host of the talkswith Alatas. The former colonial power in Cambodia recognizesneither the Hun Sen government nor the guerrilla alliance.</TEXT></DOC>
