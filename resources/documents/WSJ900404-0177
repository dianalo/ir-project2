Who would wantto live in it? What could be done with it?   Romanians have just such a white elephant on their hands,built but never finished by the executed dictator NicolaeCeaucescu, and now public property in fact.</LP><TEXT>   As they stand in long lines to buy their meat and bread,many Romanians ponder such questions. Mr. Ceaucescu's dream-- the House of the Republic -- is, rather, a folly that costthis poor country more than $1 billion over the past 10years. Today it stands empty and unused, dominating downtownBucharest, a monument to megalomania. The new governmentwon't move into it. Nobody knows quite what to do with it.Everybody has a suggestion.   It could be a gambling casino, a condominium, a bowlingalley, a thousand-screen multiplex movie theater, somebody'scorporate headquarters. Most likely, it will become a museumor a university -- or the home of some internationalorganization.   Strangely, some Romanians feel a perverse attachment tothis absurdly luxurious structure built with their money andthe sweat of their brow while most people here were shiveringin dark, unheated housing. The palace was built by some100,000 workers, many of them army conscripts forced to doconstruction work. Traian Guiu, a stocky, baldingboilermaker, who with 10,000 others is touring the building,is asked if he is angry.   &quot;Angry? I'm proud. Romanians built this. It's wonderful.&quot;   Should the edifice be sold?   &quot;No, no, no. We should never sell this building, toforeigners or anybody else,&quot; he says. &quot;It's crazy, crazy,&quot; headds, making a circle round his ear with his index finger andpausing on a grand marble staircase. &quot;But we suffered forthis. It's ours.&quot;   A crowd tarrying in the unfinished entrance hall marvelsat the beauty and the scale of it all.   &quot;Isn't this nicer than the White House?&quot; asks agap-toothed woman in a babushka.   &quot;Well, it's bigger than the White House,&quot; replies anAmerican visitor.   &quot;See,&quot; says the woman, turning to her daughter, also in ababushka. &quot;Bigger than the White House.&quot;   Bigger by far. It is also three times the size ofVersailles. The huge, boxy white Romanian structure is 466feet high, counting the flagpole on the roof. The building's12 stories enclose 106 million cubic feet of air; floor spaceis more than 3,875,000 square feet. The Romanian architectsresponsible swear it is the biggest nonskyscraper officebuilding in the world, after the Pentagon.   The building features two mammoth receiving halls, one ofwhich, at 230 feet in length and 98 feet in width (cum59-foot ceiling), can accommodate all of Bucharest'sbeautiful people and then some. A 5,382-square-foot boardroomhas a round table that takes up most of it. One of thebuilding's two amphitheaters seating thousands is illuminatedby the second biggest chandelier in Europe, with 980lightbulbs in all. There are 60 large salons, 540 spaciousoffices and perhaps a thousand other rooms -- nobody knowsfor sure how many, an architect says.   The Ceaucescu palace has a bomb shelter 300 feetunderground, and gracious his-and-hers suites in which aperson of importance might retire, fitted with cherrywoodpaneling and parquet floors. (The Ceaucescus weren't actuallygoing to live in this building. They had a nice house tothemselves elsewhere in Bucharest.) The best of Romania ishere: gray-streaked marble from Ruschita, elegant chandeliersfrom Medias, mosaic tile floors and hand-woven carpets fromthroughout the nation. The exterior, officially said to be in&quot;neo-classical French style,&quot; looks more like somethingdesigned by a committee of Stalin, Hitler and Mussolini.   French newspapers say two Japanese companies want to buythe building, but Japan's embassy here admits to knowingnothing of that. The names Donald Trump and Rupert Murdochhave been mentioned by Romanians as potential buyers, butboth men disclaim any interest.   Officials of the new Romanian government see the palace asone of many headaches bequeathed to the people by the lateCeaucescus. (Interestingly, the army, which helped build thepalace, also tried and executed the Ceaucescus.) TheodorStolojan, the first deputy finance minister, feels the needof cash to balance his budget but figures the palace would bepolitically impossible to sell. &quot;Hey,&quot; he says. &quot;I'm kind ofproud of the building, too. But I could have been just asproud of something a little smaller, like maybe one-tenth thesize.&quot;   Unfortunately for Mr. Stolojan, informal opinion polls andentries in guest books placed at the exit indicate thatvirtually everybody thinks the building should be completedat state expense, which will take another 6 billion lei(about $290,million) and maybe four more years. Romaniansalso think it should be kept in public hands. But whatexactly to do with it nobody seems to know.   &quot;Give it to Unesco,&quot; suggests schoolgirl Elena Ungureanu.   &quot;Make it a museum of Romanian folk art,&quot; says storekeeperTurcan Valenti.   &quot;Open an international museum of kitsch,&quot; proposes ananonymous German visitor.   Suggestions, serious and otherwise, include making it ahotel or an arts complex like the Georges Pompidou Center inParis; a museum of the atrocities of Stalinism, with exhibitsfrom all over Eastern Europe; a Dracula theme-park; a sitefor industrial trade shows; an institute for advancedpolitical studies.   Whatever becomes of it, the House of the People, as it isknown now that the dictator is dead and gone, willnevertheless remain Romania's most visible monument to theexcesses of Mr. Ceaucescu, who ruled the country for 24years. During the past dozen years he became increasinglyinterested in imperial grandeur, which is technically ratherodd for a Marxist-Leninist. The building was to be a homeaway from home to the Ceaucescus, Nicolae and Elena, who diedtogether before a firing squad on Christmas Day. Thebuilding, rather large for a married couple with grownchildren, would also have housed various Communist Partyinstitutions.   Even as his country struggled in increasing economic andpolitical isolation, Mr. Ceaucescu visited his monument everySaturday afternoon to check on how things were going. It wasa visit the architects dreaded.   &quot;We had to redo that stairway six times,&quot; says builderMikal Covrig. &quot;First, he wanted two columns on either side.The next week, it was one column on each side. Two weekslater, we had to take a meter and a half off the front step,with pneumatic drills. Each time, we had to redesign thewhole thing.&quot; In other rooms, he adds, Mr. Ceaucescu wouldtake a sudden dislike to a central supporting column, and theharried architects would have a week in which to figure outhow to get rid of the offending pillar without causing theceiling to collapse.   He didn't stop there. Mr. Ceaucescu ordered built a grandboulevard, 6.5 feet wider than the Champs Elysees, stretchingsouthward from the main entrance of the palace, withapartment buildings and shops of similar style on eitherside. To make room for all this, one-fourth of old Bucharestwas razed.   Originally the apartments were to be given to apparachiksand, Romanians assume, to members of Mr. Ceaucescu's fearedsecret police, the Securitate. Long finished, the apartmentshave never been occupied. Recently, the new provisionalgovernment started giving them to citizens whose homes weredamaged in December's bloody revolution, and people aremoving in.   &quot;It was all a Pharaonic dream,&quot; says Bucharest historyprofessor Stefan Andreescu, having just completed a tour ofthe palace. &quot;No Romanian king ever had such a grand dream orbuilt such a castle. Only the last king, the crazy one.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
