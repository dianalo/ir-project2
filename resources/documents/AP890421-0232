Meanwhile, officials of Shell U.K. Ltd., operator of a platformthat exploded in the North Sea this week, said Thursday thatinspection of the damage is continuing but declined to say whennormal operations would resume.   The gas explosion at the Cormorant Alpha platform Tuesday haltedproduction of nearly 500,000 barrels of oil _ or one-quarter oftotal production _ from the Brent oil fields.   Crude prices have surged more than $3 a barrel, or almost 15percent, since the accident.   ``With Brent being a major crude, it has people scared,'' saidPeter Beutel, an energy analyst with Elders Futures Inc. ``It'spossible there won't be any May deliveries.''   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the May contract for WestTexas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S. crude, soared $2.04to finish at $24.65 a barrel, the highest level in more than threeyears. The last time the near-month contract was higher was on Jan.15, 1986.   The $2.04 rise topped a $1.74 hike on Aug. 4, 1986, to becomethe largest one-day increase since trading of crude futures beganon the New York Mercantile Exchange in March 1983.   Beutel said that buyers anxious to take positions on the Maycontract before it expired Thursday also drove prices higher.   In early trading today, the June contract opened lower thenrebounded slightly after closing at $21.28 on Thursday. Thecontract was trading between $20.93 and $21.33 a barrel beforemidday EDT.   Because gasoline prices have already increased in recent weeksin response to the Alaskan oil spill, the latest jump in crudeprices may have only a minimal impact at the consumer level, unlessthe pipeline shutdown is prolonged, analysts said.   Thursday's frenzied buying was triggered by a comment fromBritish Energy Minister Cecil Parkinson that the oil field shutdowncould last up to a month.   The closure affects several major oil companies that pump oilthrough the station. Those include Exxon Corp., with about 85,000barrels a day shut in, Amoco Corp., with 10,000, and Conoco Inc.,with 24,000.   Analysts said factors that normally would have driven pricesdown during this period _ overproduction by OPEC and a softening indemand during the second quarter _ had been pushed to thebackground.   But once North Sea operations return to normal and as theAlaskan spill fades from people's minds, prices could fall backbelow $20 a barrel, they said.   ``The market is so overbought due to the psychological impact ofthese events that there's a lot of room for a fall in prices,''said Ken Miller, an analyst with the petroleum consulting firm ofPurvin andamp; Gertz Inc. ``The fundamentals don't support the prices.''   Among refined-product trading Thursday on the New YorkMercantile Exchange, the price of unleaded gasoline for Maydelivery rose 0.03 cent to 74.64 cents a gallon, while the Mayheating oil contract fell 1.04 cents to 52.29 cents a gallon.   Despite the recent accidents, an actual shortage of oil orgasoline is more anticipation than reality, market observers said.   The Department of Energy recently revised its figures to showthat demand is actually lower than thought. And OPEC is believed tobe producing more than 20.5 million barrels of oil a day, 2 millionbarrels above its self-imposed quota and about a million barrelsmore than needed to meet demand.   So while the North Sea and Alaska problems have caused temporarydisruptions, there is no evidence of a shortage of oil and gasolineto meet current world demand, analysts said.</TEXT></DOC>
