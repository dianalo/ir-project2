But Japan's aerospace industry is elated by the aftermath.    That is because the mishap, in which no one died, prompted Transportation Minister Shintaro Ishihara to make a call in parliament for development of a plane to replace Japan's aging, 60-passenger YS-11s. The Japanese aerospace industry, which has been plagued by money-losing exports and disappointing projects, hopes the minister's appeal will translate into government funds for the midsized airliner they have been itching to build.    &quot;Mr. Ishihara's statement had a lot of impact,&quot; says Takashi Ishikawa, a Science and Technology Agency official who heads a separate government aircraft project.    Japanese aircraft companies long have been eyeing the market for 50-100-seat planes as their entry into the international commercial aircraft business. They would have to export most of the planes produced to turn a profit. Their approach is typical of Japanese effort to crack a new industry by focusing on a carefully targeted niche where the dominant players are weakest.    The Ministry of International Trade and Industry calls aerospace a &quot;key&quot; industry for Japan's future. Japan's aerospace sales in the year ended last March 31 were 630 billion yen ($4.8 billion) -- only one-tenth the value of its aerospace imports.    The outlook for Japan's aircraft companies was bleak until last month's aircraft mishap. Domestic aerospace-related sales fell 1% last year from 1986. The high yen has forced Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd. to sell at a loss the fuselage parts it makes for Boeing Co's. 767 and 747 jets. With flat U.S. demand for business planes, Mitsubishi has also abandoned its cherished effort to delve into that market; it will sell to Beech Aircraft Corp. the rights to manufacture its MU-300 business jet.    The Japanese industry did win a partial victory in October in its bid to design a fighter plane for the Defense Agency. Instead of importing an off-the-shelf model, Japan will heavily modify and produce a plane based on General Dynamics Corp.'s F-16. But Japanese law bans military exports, and domestic demand is small.    So the minister's intervention, says Yasuichi Arao, senior managing director of the Society of Japanese Aerospace Companies, was &quot;like when you're playing golf and you get a tail wind.&quot;    The tail wind is a boost for a consortium that includes Kawasaki Heavy Industries Ltd., a major aerospace concern; Mitsubishi; Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd. and several airlines. The group hasn't fully formulated how it will enter the midsized airliner market. But it may join a partnership between West Germany's Messerschmitt Boelkow Blohm G.m.b.H. and the Chinese National Aero-Technology Import andamp; Export Corp. to build a 75-passenger plane.    The aerospace association estimates that Japan would have to produce more than 400 planes to break even, but that the domestic market could absorb fewer than 100. Thus, Japanese companies would have to fight it out with foreign rivals that are targeting the same niche, including Fokker B.V. of the Netherlands, British Aerospace PLC, MBB and Boeing. </TEXT></DOC>
