No less an authority than William Webster, then-directorof the FBI, has given the LA Eight a clean bill of health.Testifying in Congress shortly after their arrest, he statedthat they had committed no crimes whatsoever, and that ifthey were U.S. citizens the U.S. could do nothing againstthem. If they had aided or carried out &quot;terroristactivities,&quot; they would be guilty of several criminaloffenses, but according to the FBI, they had not.</LP><TEXT>   The Immigration and Naturalization Service's recentactions in the case underscore the lack of evidence that theLA Eight have committed or assisted in any terrorist acts. InOctober, an immigration judge ordered the INS to choosewhether to proceed under the new immigration law's&quot;terrorism&quot; provisions, or under the old McCarran-Walter Actprovisions, which base deportation not on terrorist acts buton advocacy of ideas. (Although Congress repealed theMcCarran-Walter Act last year, it let pending cases proceedunder the repealed act.) Notwithstanding the INS's loosecharges of &quot;terrorism,&quot; the agency chose to proceed under theadvocacy charges.   Thus, the conundrum posed by this case is not how to dealwith terrorists, but how to deal with a government that usesaccusations of terrorism as a cover for deporting peoplesolely for their political ideas.
