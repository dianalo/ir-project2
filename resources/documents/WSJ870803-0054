Natural gas industry experts say the answer is a resounding &quot;maybe.&quot; Rising oil prices fueled strong second-quarter earnings reports recently among such big oil producers as Royal Dutch/Shell Group's Shell Oil Co., Amoco Corp. and Unocal Corp. When the benchmark price of West Texas Intermediate crude oil briefly hit $22 a barrel, leveling out last week at $21.35, gas industry officials were also heartened.    &quot;You can't have gas prices keep going down while oil prices keep going up,&quot; says Theodore R. Eck, chief economist for Amoco, which has large gas holdings as well as its oil business. The American Gas Association, an industry trade group, predicts natural gas sales and prices should start climbing during the second half of this year, dispelling some of the gloom that has enveloped the gas industry.    Gas producers have waited five long years for the fabled &quot;gas bubble&quot; -- the industry's surplus producing capacity -- to shrink and for prices to climb. During that time there have been more wrong predictions about the bubble's demise than there are snakeskin cowboy boots on the streets of Tulsa, Okla.    &quot;The number of people who have broken their pick on this is large,&quot; concedes Thomas Petrie, a Denver-based energy analyst with First Boston Corp. Nonetheless, Mr. Petrie and other analysts have started recommending buying stocks of some independent gas producers on the basis of anticipated increases in sales and cash flow over the coming six to 12 months.    Industry experts don't expect gas prices to double the way oil has since last year. Michael German, vice president for planning and analysis for the American Gas Association, says spot gas prices are more likely to rise by year's end to about $2 a thousand cubic feet from their current $1.40 level. That would still please the industry. Mr. Petrie, for example, predicts a strong finish to the year could send the stock price of Louisiana Land andamp; Exploration Co., a New Orleans-based natural gas producer, &quot;north of $50 a share.&quot; The company's shares closed Friday at $40.875, up 25 cents, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.    Industry insiders claim there is ample reason to believe the natural gas slump has just about bottomed out and the gas bubble is starting to deflate. Although signals are mixed, some specialists say the demand for natural gas already seems to be climbing, especially from big industrial and chemical companies. Amoco's Mr. Eck predicts rising industrial demand could drive natural gas sales up about 3% this year.    There are other positive signs as well. Several Florida and Midwestern utilities have recently switched over to gas from coal and oil, says R. Gerald Bennett, executive vice president of Houston-based Enron Corp., the nation's biggest gas pipeline company. The Gas Research Institute, a gas pipeline industry group in Chicago that pegs its dues on a percentage of interstate gas sales by its members, says it is taking in more money this year.    And in Kansas, the venerable Hugoton gas field has suddenly come alive with drilling activity. Hugoton is the nation's largest onshore gas field. Last year, the Kansas Corporation Commission gave gas producers permission to double their drilling on the Hogoton field. Mr. Petrie sees Hugoton's bustle as an omen. &quot;It's a statement of confidence by producers of an inevitable and possibly near-term shift in the gloomy conditions in the natural gas industry,&quot; he says.    Meanwhile, the supply of gas appears to be shrinking. Gas companies have cut back exploration and are finding less new gas than they are producing. That suggests there will be less gas available for delivery down the line. In a report last month, the American Gas Association said the industry's surplus producing capacity hit its peak last year at about four trillion cubic feet. This year the association estimates the bubble should be down to about 2.5 trillion cubic feet and by 1990 supply and demand should be in rough balance.    That's the good news. But in an industry that has repeatedly been burned by over-optimism, there are still plenty of doubters.    Indeed, one of the nation's largest gas producers, Houston-based Tenneco Inc., announced last week that it will cut back production by about 100 million cubic feet of its gas until it is certain the market has firmed. Donald Bustos, a gas analyst with Duff andamp; Phelps in Chicago, predicts the demand for natural gas over the next five years will rise only 1% to 2% annually. Moreover, Mr. Bustos notes that both Canada and Mexico are ready to place a huge volume of natural gas on the U.S. market if demand does increase. &quot;We're suggesting gas companies aren't good buys at this point,&quot; he says.    Mr. Bustos and others say they are troubled by the U.S. Department of Energy's monthly tracking of the gas industry. The department's report, which is based on sampling 400 gas distributors, shows no turnaround in demand and a slight increase in the size of the gas bubble through June.    However, Kendrick Brown, chief of data operations for the department's reserves and natural gas division, says the government's figures may be soft, especially when it comes to spot gas sales to the industrial sector. Richard Itteilag, the American Gas Association's director of gas demand analysis, is more blunt. &quot;The federal gas demand figures, especially for industrial demand, are wrong,&quot; he says.    ---                     GAS VS.
