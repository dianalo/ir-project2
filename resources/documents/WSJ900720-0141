The compound appears to work like the experimental drugCD4, which sticks to the virus's outer coat and prevents itfrom attaching to T cells, its main immune target. But unlikeCD4 -- a large, genetically engineered protein -- the newcompound is a small, simple molecule. Called CPF, it can bemade cheaply and easily by routine chemical synthesis, givingit special promise as a drug candidate.</LP><TEXT>   The compound's chemical simplicity, however, may also beits main drawback as a potential drug, researchers cautioned.CPF has only two amino acids, or protein building blocks.Such small molecules are especially vulnerable to breakdownby enzymes in the body, so the drug may not last long enoughin the bloodstream to have much anti-viral effect. Majorquestions also remain about its toxicity and ability to blockdifferent strains of the AIDS virus.   Still, &quot;CPF is a promising forerunner to a drug thatinhibits&quot; AIDS infections, said Steven J. Burakoff, aresearcher at Boston's Dana-Farber Cancer Institute who ledin the CPF discovery with Dana-Farber's Robert W. Finberg andHarvard University chemist Stuart L. Schreiber. The test-tubestudies with CPF, Dr. Burakoff added, indicate it doesn'tinterfere with T cells' function -- an encouraging early signthe drug won't have serious immune-system side effects.Moreover, the studies showed CPF binds tightly to theAIDS-virus coat protein, called gp120, suggesting the drugwould have specific, potent anti-viral effect if significantlevels of it can be attained in the blood.   The CPF finding is reported in today's issue of thejournal Science.   Dr. Burakoff said CPF showed no signs of toxicity in apreliminary study in which the scientists injected high dosesof it into mice. He added, however, that &quot;a lot more tests&quot;must be done before the drug can be tried in humans. Aprobable next step, he added, will be tests of CPF in micewith an AIDS-related disease.   In separate studies, he said, researchers will try to findchemical cousins of CPF that best resist breakdown in thebody. The compound's structural simplicity should enableresearchers to easily spin out &quot;analogs&quot; of CPF in thatsearch, he added.   Dr. Burakoff said a large drug company has expressedinterest in CPF, but no contracts have yet been signed forits commercial development.   Like CD4, the new compound appears promising partlybecause its mode of action is different from that of AZT, anAIDS drug that works by inhibiting replication of the viruswithin infected cells. Thus, it may work synergistically withAZT and help fight AZT-resistant strains of the AIDS virus.   Additionally, CPF may offer some advantages over CD4. Thenew compound probably could be given orally, Dr. Burakoffnoted, compared with CD4, which is injected. Moreover,researchers now believe that to get anti-viral effects withCD4 in patients, they will need to use much higher doses ofit than have been tried so far in clinical studies. Butmaking large amounts of CD4 has proved difficult andexpensive -- problems that shouldn't apply to CPF.</TEXT></DOC>
