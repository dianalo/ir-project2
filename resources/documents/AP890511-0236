Gonzalez, D-Texas,said Wednesday.   Gonzalez was referring to the savings and loan crisis. TheEximbank lends mostly to Third World countries to encourage salesof American goods.   ``The Export-Import clearly fulfills a very useful, evenessential purpose,'' Gonzalez said. ``It creates jobs domesticallyand helps our export industry lower our massive trade deficit.   ``But the Eximbank is insolvent. This means the budget deficitand cost of subsidizing our export industry are both understated by$4 to $6 billion.   ``We have seen with the tragic FSLIC crisis that masking thetrue insolvency of a government agency has disastrous results andthe taxpayer ultimately bears the burden of this irresponsibility.''   William Ryan, the bank's acting president, replied that normalaccounting practices do not apply because the bank is backed by thefull faith and credit of the federal government.   Gonzalez complained that it still carries as assets loans madeto Cuba before President Fidel Castro took over and to China beforethe victory of the Communists on the mainland.   ``Eximbank has not received a cent on these loans in over 40years,'' he said.   Ryan said these were debts of sovereign countries and there issome hope of collecting them.   Gonzalez spoke at a hearing of his panel's subcommittee oninternational development. Ryan was appearing before it to say thatdemand for the bank's loans last year exceeded its $693 millionceiling by $150 million, and it expected the same thing to happenagain in the year that ends Sept. 30.   ``As a result, we may again have to defer $150 million to $250million in authorizations into 1990,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
