(graph)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Tomorrow's Word Processors TodayandM;A new age of PC-based word processing is here, and it's a different world.andO;The forerunners of this upstart generation have abandoned the familiarDOS-based character mode in favor of a graphics environment.andP;  In doing so,they show admirable foresight--GUIs (graphical user interfaces) and GUI-basedsoftware are sure to become more significant, perhaps dominant, in PCtechnology over the next several years.andM;Like any pioneers, graphical word processors have obstacles to surmount.andO;They've got to win over the people who have been using character-based wordprocessors for a long time, and who may find GUIs difficult to get used to.andO;In fact, many of these folks have tried various GUI products and have foundthem to be wanting in speed or computing style; the danger is that they'llsuccumb to negative thoughts about these new word processors before they eventry them.andM;That would be a mistake because the GUI environment is a powerful one forproducing fine-quality, typeset-grade text output.andP;  The graphical interfacegives you access to the tools necessary for generating that quality.andO;Graphics-based word processors allow you to perform tasks not possible intraditional, character-based programs.andM;Four of the products reviewed here--Microsoft Word for Windows, Ami, AmiProfessional, and Legend--run under Microsoft Windows.andP;  We tested them usingWindows 2.11; Windows 3.0 was unavailable at press time.andP;  But there's not oneproduct in that group that won't work better with the new, improved versionof Microsoft's DOS-based GUI.andP;  The other product we review, DeScribe, is theonly word processor to use OS/2's Presentation Manager, and we tested itunder Release 1.1.andP;  (However, don't expect DeScribe to be the solePresentation Manager entrant forever; you can bet that Microsoft will sooncome out with an OS/2 version of Word.)andM;WORD PROCESSING: YESTERDAY,andM;TODAY, TOMORROW ...andM;Early word processors treated the task at hand as one of formattingcharacters into words, sentences, and paragraphs, and then placing them intopredefined locations on a piece of paper.andP;  This model depended on fixed ormonospaced typefaces like the ones found on typewriters.andP;  A text-based wordprocessor that uses the PC's 2,000 on-screen characters to display youroutput works just fine in this environment.andP;  The characters' on-screenlocations and sizes are fixed, and even the screen's 80-character line lengthhelps make everything look like the final paper output.andM;When you introduce proportional typefaces into this mix that a word processorhas to consider, the situation gets more complicated.andP;  The old model withfixed spacing quickly loses its meaning, and the usefulness of the PC'sfixed-size, fixed-position text screen evaporates, because a character'sfinal location on a page no longer falls into neat, evenly dividedpigeonholes.andP;  Instead, its final position falls wherever the width of thecharacter and its neighbors require it to occur.andP;  The only way fixed-spacedon-screen characters can represent widths is to stretch or shrink linelengths, which makes them drop off the edge of the screen, creating a jaggedlook.andP;  That's not much help when you're depending on the screen to show youwhat your final printed document will look like.andM;THE PRINTER FACTORandM;Today's PC-based word processing reality is even more complex because itincludes laser printers, which use proportional typefaces (first introducedto PCs on daisy wheel printers), in addition to multiple type sizes used tocreate a family of fonts in each of the available typefaces.andP;  Some printers,such as the new Hewlett-Packard LaserJet III and PostScript printers, evenuse scalable typefaces to create an infinite family of fonts for eachtypeface.andP;  I haven't even mentioned a laser printer's ability to positionlines of type vertically almost anywhere on a page, or the adroitness withwhich it can make type darker, kern it, or rotate it by 360 degrees.andM;Sure, there are character-based word processors on the market that dealsuccessfully with most laser printer typography issues, although WordPerfectis the only one that rotates fonts.andP;  Products, such as WordPerfect, MicrosoftWord, XyWrite, DisplayWrite, and even WordStar, will cope with aLaserJet-compatible or PostScript language printer just fine.andP;  However, yourediting screen will show you only the same 2,000 characters you saw whendealing with fixed-space word processing models--it takes special codes,colors, and prompts to indicate what's really going on with your text.andO;Better products have a page-preview mode that shows you a graphicsrepresentation of the finished page, but usually that screen is not editable(the exception here is XyWrite), which means you have to go back to themonospaced edit screen to fix any problems you discover.andM;Graphical word processors use a WYSIWYG editing screen to display a virtuallyexact representation of your printed text at the same time you are working onyour document.andP;  If you change the size of the typeface, you'll see the largerfont onscreen immediately.andP;  You'll also see what happens when you switchtypefaces, bold-face text, adjust line height and interparagraph spacing, oruse an envelope-size page to create laser-printed envelopes.andP;  Importantly,you will quickly discover the problems your formatting ideas arecreating--for instance, a conflict between line height and font may cause twolines to interfere with each other.andM;That's just the beginning of the typographic possibilities you receive withthis new breed of products.andP;  You can insert just about anything frombulletpoints to boiler-plates, and you can format it however you like.andP;  It'snot every day that you need three-column text with intercolumn rulers orheadline-size type across two of them, but when you do, all of theseGUI-based products will be accommodating.andP;  And when it's time to use a colorprinter to make overhead slides, they will be capable of handling that demandas well.andM;GRAPHICS, OF COURSEandM;Then there are graphics.andP;  These are, after all, GUI-based products, so if youwant to place the company's logo in your text, or even create your ownletterhead using that logo, just insert the scanned image where you need it.andO;Better yet, design a new image using any one of a number of good GUI-baseddrawing products, then cut it out and paste it into your document.andP;  Theproducts in this review allow you to edit graphics for size and position, andsome let you draw the graphic in place so that you don't have to use anotherproduct.andM;Your word processing document can also be the recipient of charts deliveredvia warm or cold links from fellow GUI-based applications like MicrosoftExcel, or from standard DOS products like Lotus 1-2-3.andP;  Microsoft Word forWindows, for example, lets you use a live DDE (dynamic data exchange) link toExcel; if you want to amaze your friends, you can create a two-way linkbetween the products so that a value entered into Word will be sent to anExcel spreadsheet, and the modified chart sent back to Word.andM;DTP SUBSTITUTES?andM;With such extensive graphics capabilities, you may start to wonder if theseGUI-based word processors can take the place of desktop publishing products.andO;In fact, some of these programs even bill themselves as &quot;word publishers&quot; or&quot;document processors.&quot;andP;  However, while these systems do include DTP-likeelements such as adjustable gutter boundaries and intercolumn rulers, they'rejust not as powerful as real high-end desktop publishers.andM;Page layout in a typeset-driven world is not quite the same thing as layingout pages for a laser printer.andP;  It's really not easy to use these wordprocessors for multiple stories that jump from one page to another.andP;  At best,these word processors compete with low-end desktop publishing packages--andthey cost a whole lot more.andM;However, for the extra money, you get extra word processing power that youwon't find in a low-end DTP package or in your favorite character-based texteditor.andP;  They move beyond the limitations of their character-based brethren,chiefly because program designers and coders can develop more-flexible andmore-powerful programs in a graphics environment.andP;  Moving text, for example,is much easier with a graphical word processor, because its mouse-basedblocking system is quicker than the cursor-based system designed forcharacter-mode word processing.andP;  Word for Windows goes a step further with anincredible outliner that takes advantage of the GUI environment to let youeasily move text and headings up and down, and promote or demote them, withthe mouse or icon buttons.andM;MACROS AND FORMATTINGandM;Macros have come a long way in these systems.andP;  Ami Pro and Word for Windowsinclude languages that are similar to BASIC, and give you plenty of power tocustomize your environment and create interactive documents.andP;  Documentcontrol, especially in Ami and Word, goes beyond anything found in the DOSworld.andP;  In addition to normal document background information and searchfacilities, newer-generation document management includes security locks toprevent a reader from modifying the actual text while allowing the insertionof comments.andM;Style-based formatting is a powerful tool that's found in virtually all ofthe products that are reviewed here.andP;  This is something that exists in only afew character-based word processors because it must be implemented there witha complex menu system that requires specifying arcane formatting parameters.andO;At best, those implementations are difficult to understand, and at worstthey're impossible to use.andP;  It's much easier to understand and work withstyle sheets in a GUI-based word processing program because you can simplyteach the product the style you want.andP;  Just format your text (andsimultaneously see the effects of the formatting), then tell the wordprocessor to save that formatting as a style.andM;All of these products benefit from the standard pull-down menus, dialogboxes, and buttons.andP;  Using them is effective, but often clumsy and slow.andP;  Thebetter GUI-based word processors use the graphics environments to create newforms of interacting with you that are more in tune with the task at hand.andO;Ami, for example, gives you a &quot;toolkit&quot; that provides instant access toformatting text and menus.andP;  Word provides special icon bars called the&quot;ribbon and ruler&quot; that let you access its formatting technology.andM;All the products provide you with a variety of ways to view your document,ranging from faster modes that use draft fonts to full-page preview modesthat let you look at multiple pages, and even change their appearance.andM;THE DRAWBACKSandM;Not everything in the graphics-based world is perfect, though.andP;  GUI-basedword processors are great to use, but they're also victims of their ownenvironment and suffer from that in both realism and performance.andP;  Whilethey're advertised as having WYSIWYG screens, they really are&quot;what-you-see-is-not-quite-what-you-get,&quot; because the screen typography inWindows and Presentation Manager is not precise.andP;  The font shapes are notaccurate, nor are the metrics; that means you'll see line breaks that are notquite correct and typefaces that only reflect the look you'll see on paper.andM;Perhaps more important is the speed issue.andP;  Windows is positioned these daysas being ripe for any PC, from XTs to 486-based EISA machines.andP;  The truth isyou won't be satisfied by the performance of your GUI-based word processor onanything less than a 12.5-MHz 286, and then only if you're working on fairlyshort documents.andP;  You can compensate for slower speed by using features likedraft mode, and newer editions of these products (like Ami Pro, Release 1.16)will be faster.andM;For now, you'll probably want to make the transition to graphics-based wordprocessing only if you've got a fast 286, 386, or 486 machine.andP;  If you do,going GUI is the best way to get a lot more out of your word processing, andhave a lot more fun doing it.andP;  PC Magazine assesses a word processingprogram's suitability in five arenas--Personal, Professional, Corporate,Legal, and Desktop Publishing--and assigns a point value for each one.andP;  Thesesubjective ratings, on a scale from 0 to 4, are presented along with eachreview, and translate as follows: 0--lacks feature or is not at all suited;1--poorly suited; 2--some capability; 3--well suited; 4--ideal for the task.andM;A Personal word processor should be very easy to learn and use; it is bestsuited for short documents, letters, and memos.andP;  Important features includecontext-sensitive help, simple menus, and clear documentation.andP;  Users includestudents, home users, executives, and other professionals who write shortdocuments.andM;A Professional word processor is more full-featured.andP;  It should be able tohandle long documents with extensive page formatting, including complexheaders, footers, and indexing.andP;  Print control and dictionary support areboth important, and likely users include professional and technical writters,academics, and those working in the publishing industry.andM;Corporate word processors should easily handle short documents, letters, andrepetitive memos that are produced often, and should offer mail-merge.andO;Document summaries (including author, revisor, keywords) and envelopeprinting are musts.andP;  Parallel versions of the programs that run on IBM andDEC mainframes and minis or Unix systems can also be a plus.andP;  Note that notall users within corporations are corporate users.andM;Legal refers to the program's ability to provide the special functions andformats required by lawyers and law offices, including line numbering,redilining and revision marking, compilation of tables of authorities, filecomparison, and password protection.andM;Word processors with Desktop Publishing features must be able to handlemultiple columns of text, import common graphics files (.PCX,.CGM, TIFF) aswell as Lotus 1-2-3 and Excel spreadsheet data.andP;  They should also be capablefront ends and partners for the PageMaker and Ventura Publisher desktoppublishing packages.andM;To receive a rating of 4, the product should provide all features usersexpect now (based on competitive products) or will find in similar productsin the near future (a DTP rating of 4 indicates a word processor withsuperior DTP features, but not a word processor equal to PageMaker or VenturaPublisher).andM;* Ami ProfessionalandM;* Microsoft Word for WindowsandM;Is now the time to switch to a graphical word processor?andP;  Yes, but only ifyou've got fast hardware and if you've seen a feature so compelling that it'sworth what will probably be a time-consuming transition.andP;  After all,WordPerfect and its competitors still have a lot of living left to do in theDOS world.andP;  They won't disappear soon.andM;Only two GUI-based word processors have enough features and convenience to beconsidered a plausible alternative to character-based programs, and both areso plausible that you may never look back.andP;  If you choose either AmiProfessional or Microsoft Word for Windows, you'll choose a program that hasfunctions you won't find anywhere among character-based programs.andP;  If youwork under Windows 2.x, you'll sacrifice a lot of speed compared tostraight-DOS word processors, but with Windows 3.0, the sacrifice is smallerand less painful.andM;Ami Professional does more to help you construct a document than any otherprogram on the market, and it lets you enjoy yourself in the process.andP;  If itonly offered its word processing features, it still would be impressiveenough to earn the laurels of Editor's Choice, but it also adds extensivedrawing and charting functions, convenient tables, and file-managementfeatures.andP;  Windows is designed to let you switch easily from one program toanother.andP;  With Ami Professional, you may not need any other.andM;Ami Professional has its drawbacks.andP;  It doesn't give you full outlining, andthe current version hasn't been fully freed from bugs.andP;  But the Windows3.0-compatible Version 1.2, due by the time you read this, looks bug-freeeven in the beta version, and it adds a welcome infusion of speed.andM;Microsoft Word for Windows isn't as wide as Ami Professional, but it goesdeeper.andP;  Offering virtually all the functions of the DOS version of MicrosoftWord, it also adds sophisticated, innovative macro features that mayeventually transform all PC word processing.andP;  Keep in mind, however, thatyou'll need a fast 286 machine (at least 20 MHz and preferably 33 MHz) tomake the program run as fast as it should.andM;A Word for Windows document can be a complex interactive system that guidesthe user through the process of creating a document and then maks its owndecisions on how it should be printed and formatted depending on yourchoices.andP;  If you simply want to write a letter or a report, Word for Windowsmakes the job of formatting simpler and more intuitive than any other programyou can find.andP;  DDE hotlinks to Excel are a spectacular added benefit, showingoff the exciting possibilities of graphical environments (Ami Pro has themtoo).andM;Word for Windows has its deficiencies, but they're small ones.andP;  You'll needsome expertise in macros and templates before you can customize the program,and some functions, even under Windows 3.0, crawl when they should leap.andP;  ButWord for Windows is one of the most successful and ambitious programs everreleased for the PC, and there are few users who won't find something in itthat they've always wanted to see in the programs they're using now.andM;ENVIRONMENTAL AWARENESSandM;Word processors, like the ones evaluated here, are evolving into full-fledgeddocument processors that are able to interact with other applications andimport all kinds of information smoothly.andP;  By taking advantage of thegraphical environments in which they operate, these programs areless-constrained than their DOS-based cousins.andM;Four of the five products we review--Ami, Ami Professional, Word for Windows,and Legend--run under Microsoft Windows.andP;  This graphical environment providesthese packages with benefits like WYSIWYG displays and DDE links.andP;  But eventhough they employ a GUI environment, Microsoft Windows is still DOS-based,and it has all the limitations of that operating environment.andP;  The mostpainful limitation is that applications must run within the 640K memoryconstraint in real mode.andP;  Windows/286 utilizes expanded memory, swapping tohandle multiple applications and memory intensive programs; Windows/386 canalso use expanded memory.andP;  It reserves a block of RAM up to 640K for eachapplication; with a 386 or 386SX processor, each of these virtual machinescan access expanded memory segments.andP;  This lets you run large applications ineach virtual machine, but the same constraints that apply to Windows/286sessions apply to Windows/386 when multiple sessions are running.andM;Microsoft's new Windows 3.0 has the ability to implement single applicationsessions in up to 16MB of extended memory in protected mode (when you use anapplication compliant with Windows 3.0 specifications).andP;  That's a great leapforward.andM;RIDING A NEW WAVEandM;Hewlett-Packard's NewWave, Version 1.0, is an object-oriented interface thatruns over Microsoft Windows/286, Version 2.11.andP;  NewWave lets you view anyapplication that meets its specifications as an object.andP;  Thus, AmiProfessional, Microsoft Excel, New Media Graphics' Video NewWave, ChannelComputing's Forest andamp; Trees, and other programs can be intertwined into atotal office system.andM;Not only can information be shared among applications via DDE, but by usingNewWave's agent facility--a macro tool that triggers events with eachobject--a system that interfaces your word processor with e-mail, full-motionvideo, and your database can be seamlessly designed.andP;  Using NewWave, you canproduce a document on-screen that responds to information on-line and showsthe appropriate video in an object box when you hit a button.andP;  Informationentered into a spreadsheet can automatically trigger appropriate forms from aword processor or database that must be sent out, and there is no need forthe user to worry about the other products necessary to perform the task.andO;Versions of NewWave are slated for OS/2 and other releases of Windows in thenear future.andM;OS/2 ADVANTAGESandM;OS/2 (which hosts DeScribe, the fifth word processor reviewed here) has allthe advantages of Windows 3.0 with the added benefits of threads (sets ofmemory registers that depict the status of a process).andP;  An OS/2 process canhave multiple threads that may be shared by other processes.andP;  As withNewWave, a system can be designed to use multiple applications from variousvendors to perform a job.andP;  For example, you can be filling in your database'sdata input screen in a foreground session, while in the background a nicelyformatted document is printing and a spreadsheet is updating its information.andM;It's easy to see how the word processor of the future will become an integralpart of a wider system that allows users to maintain and update theirdocuments without having to perform a series of repetitive tasks or difficultimportations.andP;  Multitasking operating systems like Windows, NewWave, and OS/2will make it happen.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
