Burrows, director of NIST's National Computer Systems Laboratory andacting board chairman, said any report to Congress would discuss how to dealwith growing technologies such as facsimile transmissions and governmentwideefforts to share data.andP;  He said agencies must make security part of theircultures.andM;&quot;We have to get at what government uses computers for and how to get securityinto an architecture.andP;  It's a matter of how to tie the old and new andmaintain security.andP;  There are tactical and operational problems as more andmore people network things together,&quot; Burrows said.andM;&quot;Congress wants to know all the problem areas, but we haven't examined themindepth yet.andP;  We need to be deliberate and certain to be useful.andP;  The nextstep is to make sure agencies have security policy, documents, plans andreview personnel to review themselves.&quot;andM;Meanwhile, NIST officials are continuing to review agency security plans andwill testify before Congress on the number of plans received, how wellagencies adhered to Office of Management and Budget guidelines and what theinitial reviews indicate about federal systems security.andM;As for the agency security plan reviews, Douglas B. Hunt, a NIST computerspecialist in charge of the review teams, said NIST had received slightlymore than 1,500 plans from 59 of 84 agencies.andP;  Hunt said OMB officials arecalling those agencies that have not submitted plans but no penalties areforthcoming.andM;Thus far NIST and National Security Agency reviewers have examined about 400plans.andP;  Under the review procedures, plans are logged into a database andassigned a tracking number and location for the entire review process.andM;Hunt said the reviews take anywhere from 20 minutes for plans that obviouslylack information, to one hour or more depending on the amount of informationand how it is organized.andP;  The review teams check to see if agencies haveincluded at least descriptions of the systems themselves, the generic typesof information involved, the sensitivity concerns, and the controls that arein place or planned.andM;&quot;The reviews are a reasonable attempt to do exactly what OMB stated in theguidelines,&quot; Hunt said.andP;  &quot;It takes about one hour to review a good plan.andP;  Thereview time has more to do with how far the plan deviates from format.andP;  Theorganization of information is extremely important.&quot;andM;Hunt said he has sent out seven letters to agencies that failed to submitadequate information.andP;  Plans are reviewed in the order they were received,and Hunt said he recently returned the first completed review to theDepartment of Housing and Urban Development.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
