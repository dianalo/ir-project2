To listen to conservatives, Rep. Gingrich has deliveredand Sen. Gramm has sold out. Rep. Gingrich is calling for taxcuts while Sen. Gramm, joining President Bush, has concludedthat raising taxes is the only way to get a pact to reducethe budget deficit.</LP><TEXT>   But behind the closed doors, participants say, thenormally strident Rep. Gingrich is mute and Sen. Gramm hasemerged as the more-effective advocate of cuttingcapital-gains taxes and resisting Democratic demands forhigher income-tax rates.   In short, Rep. Gingrich is still playing the outsiders'game, even though the stocky, white-haired congressman fromGeorgia is now No. 2 in the House Republican leadership. AndSen. Gramm, a lanky Georgia native who moved to Texas toteach economics, is fast trading his reputation as a bombthrower for one as a pragmatic insider.   For a time, some conservatives worried that both men hadbeen co-opted by Mr. Bush and top GOP congressional leaderswhen the pair was named to the Republican negotiating team inan obvious attempt to calm the party's right wing. But lastmonth, Rep. Gingrich suddenly began calling for tax cuts.   &quot;Gingrich looks like he may be coming around,&quot; says budgetanalyst Dan Mitchell of the Heritage Foundation, aconservative think tank. &quot;He realizes that falling on hissword for the White House isn't exactly a great thing to dofor his political career. Gramm hasn't said he would supportwhatever crummy agreement comes out, but it looks like thatis what he's going to do.&quot;   &quot;I have been . . . radicalized by the summit in watching .. . the Democrats,&quot; Rep. Gingrich said last month in one ofseveral headline-grabbing speeches that won him applause fromconservative pundits. &quot;They would love to have more tax moneybecause . . . they have all this political spending they wantto do.&quot;   Sen. Gramm, though quick to condemn what he views asDemocrats' addiction to spending, sees his role differently.&quot;Do you want to govern or do you want to just protest?&quot;   Mr. Gingrich says of his colleague: &quot;He's a little morecooperative than I am. But I am absolutely convinced that ifoffered a bad deal, he would walk away from it -- just as Iwould walk away from it.&quot;   As the contrast in their approaches became increasinglyevident, Sen. Gramm flew to suburban Atlanta earlier thismonth to campaign for Rep. Gingrich's re-election -- and tosay he wouldn't join any attempt to torpedo the talks. Askedabout the trip, Sen. Gramm says only, &quot;I don't kiss andtell.&quot;   Even though Sen. Gramm has been a persistent advocateinside the talks for many of their views, conservativesremain uneasy. Rep. Vin Weber (R., Minn.), a Gingrichlieutenant in the House, says, &quot;Newt has said that first andforemost he is advocating the basic positions of theRepublican Party, which is opposition to higher taxes andsupport for a lower capital-gains tax, while Phil has decidedhe's going to represent the point of view of theadministration,&quot; namely to strike a deficit-reduction dealwith the Democrats even if that means higher taxes.   Sen. Gramm responds that it is &quot;wishful thinking&quot; to saythat higher taxes can be avoided. &quot;If I had the freedom towrite the package myself, it wouldn't have revenues. But Ididn't get to choose the members of the summit and I didn'tget to choose the members of the House and Senate.&quot;   Although the two men share political philosophies, Rep.Gingrich broke with President Reagan in 1982 and votedagainst a tax increase while then-Rep. Gramm, at the time aDemocrat, voted for it. Their paths have diverged again thisyear, a reflection of differing personal ambitions as well asthe peculiarities of the House and Senate.   Rep. Gingrich figures that only through confrontation canthe frustrated Republican minority unseat the Democraticliberals who have dominated the House for 36 years. His dreamis to lead Republicans to power under the banner of tax cuts-- but that looks like a dream deferred by Mr. Bush'srepudiation of his no-new-taxes promise.   In the past few months, Rep. Gingrich has been tripped upby conflicts between his roles as tax foe and budgetnegotiator. In May, he declared in a fund-raising letter: &quot;Istrongly believe that increasing taxes on working people willNOT solve our country's massive budget problems]&quot; In July, hejoined other House Republicans in vowing opposition to taxincreases of any kind. But later that month, witnesses say,he told Democrats at the closed-door budget summit: &quot;I'mprepared to sponsor and support raising taxes,&quot; a statementthat quickly spread through the Capitol. Embarrassed, heexplained on the House floor the next morning that he wouldsupport higher taxes -- but only after Democrats agreed tocut spending.   Then late last month, Rep. Gingrich did anotherabout-face. With the economy weakening and the administrationunwilling to abandon the budget summit as he had hoped, hebegan calling for billions of dollars in tax cuts to reviveeconomic growth.   &quot;He changes his position {on taxes} more often than mostpeople change socks,&quot; charges his Democratic challenger inhis fall re-election contest, attorney David Worley.   Lately, Rep. Gingrich has been pressing his views onfellow Republican negotiators, occasionally jousting withWhite House Budget Director Richard Darman. But he has saidlittle at negotiating sessions with the Democrats.   &quot;Why fight every day in a room that's stacked againstyou?&quot; says Rep. Weber. &quot;In the end, they are going to have togo to Newt to sign off on the deal, or decide they're goingto go around the House Republicans.&quot;   Mr. Gingrich, acknowledging his unpopularity among thoseat the summit table, says of himself, &quot;It's not all thateffective for Newt to push something.&quot;   In contrast to the fiercely partisan Rep. Gingrich, Sen.Gramm has grown accustomed to working with Democrats in theSenate, where Republicans have more influence because oftheir numbers.   And while Rep. Gingrich draws his strength fromconservatives, Sen. Gramm is said to be cultivating moderateRepublicans. For now, he wants to be elected chairman of theGOP Senate campaign fund-raising committee, but his ultimategoal is to succeed George Bush in 1996.   At the budget talks, even Democrats have been impressed bySen. Gramm's forceful yet conciliatory arguments. One liberalconfides that he finds himself agreeing more often with Sen.Gramm than with any other negotiator.   The transition to team player began last year when Sen.Gramm won assignment to the Budget Committee, from whichSenate GOP leaders had previously blocked him, and to thecoveted Appropriations Committee. In that insider's world,where party labels blur amid the trading, he has cooperatedto win funding for home-state projects.   Some critics suggest that Sen. Gramm is siding with Mr.Bush in part because the president reappointed his wife,Wendy, as chairman of the Commodity Futures TradingCommission even though she has sparred repeatedly withTreasury Secretary Nicholas Brady.   But a more-immediate motive may be the prospect of massiveacross-the-board spending cuts if the budget talks fail. Thecuts would literally bear Sen. Gramm's name: They aremandated under the 1985 Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction lawthat the Texan co-sponsored.   &quot;He naturally would be disinclined to see that one badthing that has his fingerprints on it happen,&quot; says a fellowTexas GOP conservative, Rep. Dick Armey. &quot;So I'm sure thatmakes him more willing to consider alternatives.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
