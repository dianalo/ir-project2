Economic policy coordination, added German centralbank governor Karl Otto Poehl, &quot;doesn't mean that everyonedoes the same thing at the same time.&quot;   The conflict over interest rates emerged at Sunday'smeeting of the finance ministers and central bank presidentsof the Group of Seven industrialized nations: the U.S.,Japan, Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada. TheTreasury failed at that meeting to win internationalendorsement for interest-rate cuts.   Japanese Finance Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto said yesterdaythat countries should &quot;exercise all due vigilance against therisks of recession,&quot; but added that some countries areplagued by high inflation. &quot;It is essential that {allnations} continue to be alert to price trends,&quot; he said.   Among the G-7 nations, only France, which is struggling toreverse a slide in growth, showed much real support for lowerinterest rates. &quot;I think we should look more clearly at therisk of recession,&quot; said French Finance Minister PierreBeregovoy, stressing the need for coordinated effort to&quot;bring down real interest rates.&quot;   Even the U.S. isn't entirely united behind the Treasuryapproach. The Federal Reserve, which remains concerned aboutinflation, recently has resisted Treasury pressure for moreinterest-rate cuts.   The IMF and World Bank are devoting considerable time attheir meetings to eastern Europe and its reform efforts. Mr.Brady said all nations should consider whether they can openmarkets &quot;more effectively to the reforming economies ofeastern Europe.&quot; He also said, &quot;When the Soviet Union isexperiencing economic difficulties, countries should avoidusing export credits to displace eastern European exports tothat country.&quot;   In a communique released yesterday, a group of 10industrialized nations said the primary responsibility forreform in eastern and central Europe lies with the nationsthemselves. But the so-called G-10, which includes the U.S.,Japan and western European nations, also said &quot;a growingworld economy, open markets and appropriate externalassistance&quot; are &quot;necessary complements.&quot;   The G-10 reaffirmed that Poland's recent debt agreement,under which western governments will forgive at least 50% oftheir debt to that country, was &quot;a special case.&quot; It warnedagainst too much use of debt-relief in the region.   Japan's Mr. Hashimoto argued that if countries don't repayofficial loans, they shouldn't receive new governmentcredits.   But France's Mr. Beregovoy said, &quot;there may be otherexceptional cases&quot; besides Poland that warrantdebt-forgiveness. He cited some of the poorer middle-incomenations in Africa.</TEXT></DOC>
