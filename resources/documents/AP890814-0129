U.S. District Court Judge Thomas Hogan refused to disturb aninterim step instituted by the U.S. Commerce Department restrictingtrawling times to 105-minute intervals.   The National Wildlife Federation said the 105-minute requirementfails to protect endangered sea turtles and has asked the judge torequire the shrimpers to equip their nets with the turtle excluderdevices, called TEDs.   Hogan refused to rule on the merits of the 105-minuterequirement, saying he would await a final rule by the commercesecretary.   The interim restriction ``satisfies the court's order that someconservation measures be put in place while permanent modificationof the existing TED regulations are being considered,'' Hogan said.   ``It remains to be seen how the secretary will justify the suddenshift away from TEDs and the adoption of a 105-minute tow timerestriction,'' said the judge.   Hogan said the National Wildlife Federation raised ``substantialconcerns'' in a lawsuit regarding the adequacy of the 105-minute towtime restriction, but called it ``premature'' to rule on theirobjections.   Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher has data from National MarineFisheries Service scientists showing the mortality rate from a105-minute tow time is more than four times greater than what thesecretary has admitted, says the federation.   Following an order issued by the judge, Mosbacher issued the105-minute interim requirement. It became effective Aug. 8 andexpires Sept. 8.   Mosbacher decided July 24 to suspend requirements for excluderdevices after Texas and Louisiana shrimp fishermen protested theiruse by blockadng Gulf Coast shipping channels. The fishermen say theturtle excluder devices reduce their catch by as much as a third.   Hogan concluded that Mosbacher had failed to show good cause forsuspending the existing TED regulations for 45 days without adoptingan interim conservation measure.   ``The secretary has utterly failed to show how the 45-daysuspension of any protection for endangered and threatened turtles,during the height of the Gulf shrimping season, will fosterconservation,'' said Hogan's 17-page opinion.   The wildlife federation, seeking to force the Commerce Departmentto require the Gulf Coast shrimpers to use the TEDs, sued Mosbacherthe same day he suspended the regulations.   The wildlife group is ``disappointed'' that the court is notrequiring the use of the excluder devices, said Robert Irvin, alawyer for the wildlife federation. ``We think that the 105-minutetow time limit does not protect the turtles and that the governmenthas not presented any evidence to the contrary.''   Irvin said he is ``pleased'' with the portion of Hogan's rulingwhich ``makes it very clear that the secretary had no justification,legal or factual, for the suspension'' of the regulation.   The excluder devices are big boxes with hinged sides attached tonets which allow turtles to swim through.   Most shrimpers in South Carolina will continue to use the turtleexcluder devices, or TEDs, rather than pull their nets up every 105minutes, said Wally Shaffer, executive director of the SouthCarolina Shrimpers Association.   Since South Carolina shrimpers can only drag their nets duringdaylight, pulling the nets every 105 minutes for a half-hour wouldsubstantially cut back the number of shrimp caught, Shaffer said.   ``What it does mean is if a fisherman chose to go without TEDs,he would have to have the nets out for two and a half or three hoursa day,'' he said. ``So most of them have chosen to use TEDs.''   South Carolina mandated the use of the device before the TEDregulation went into effect for other states.</TEXT></DOC>
