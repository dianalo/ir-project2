Ash-Shiraa said two other British hostages will be freed withWaite, who has been missing since January 1987. Al-Anwar, aconservative daily newspaper based in Christian east Beirut, saidWaite would be freed within 72 hours.   An Israeli newpaper said the United States made a deal with Iranto free American hostages in exchange for delivery of arms andspare parts through South Korea. U.S. officials denied the report.   Lebanese police said two unidentified foreigners kidnapped inMoslem west Beirut 21 months ago were Czechoslovak businessmen heldonly a few days.   That leaves 14 foreigners missing in Lebanon, including nineAmericans.   The Anglican church and British government said they had noinformation about Waite.   Both Beirut publications have been inaccurate in recent reportsabout hostages. But Ash-Shiraa, based in Moslem west Beirut,correctly revealed in November 1986 that the United States hadsecretly delivered arms to Iran.   The report about arms in The Nation, a new English-languageIsraeli weekly, was not attributed. It said the U.S. governmentalso agreed to pay $7 million ransom to Shiite Moslem extremistsholding the hostages but refused their demand for immunity fromprosecution.   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater denied the report butsaid there were ``a lot of free-lancers, independent operators inthe region.'' On Thursday, Secretary of State George P. Shultz saidWashington was not dealing with Iran and that ``Anyone who tries tocut across our policies should butt out.''   President Reagan refused questions about the reports as he leftfor a speaking engagement in Detroit. Fitzwater, traveling withhim, said there was ``nothing new'' on any hostages.   The British Foreign Office said of the Waite story: ``We havenothing that would indicate this is anything different from all thehundreds of previous reports.''   Lambeth Palace, London headquarters of the archbishop ofCanterbury, said: ``We have not heard anything here and in view ofthe sort of relationships we have established, we would be likelyto hear something.''   Waite, personal emissary of Archbishop Robert Runcie,disappeared after leaving his west Beirut hotel to meet with agroup holding hostages, including American Terry Anderson.   Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent of The AssociatedPress, was kidnapped March 16, 1985, and is the foreigner heldlongest.   Britain's recent decision to restore full diplomatic relationswith Iran ``provided efforts currently under way to release Waiteand his countrymen with a strong impetus,'' Ash-Shiraa reported.   The other British hostages are journalist Alec Collett,kidnapped March 25, 1985, and television news producer JohnMcCarthy, seized April 17, 1986. Hostage Brian Keenan, held sinceApril 11, 1986, is Irish but also holds a British passport.   On April 23, 1986, a group calling itself the RevolutionaryOrganization of Socialist Moslems said it had killed Collett. Avideotape purporting to show him hanged was made public, but nobody was found.   Ash-Shiraa quoted a security source it did not name as sayingthe release Monday of Mithileshwar Singh, an Indian who is aresident U.S. alien, marked ``the beginning of the release of moreAmerican hostages.''   ``The source said American hostages would be released before theU.S. presidential elections,'' it said without further elaboration.   Fitzwater, asked whether the U.S. government was involved innegotiations or deals for Singh's release, replied: ``That's nottrue.''   Singh was kidnapped Jan. 24, 1987, by a pro-Iranian groupcalling itself Islamic Jihad for the Liberation of Palestine. Takenwith him from the campus of the U.S.-affiliated Beirut UniversityCollege were American teachers Alann Steen, Robert Polhill andJesse Turner.      The Nation report said that two weeks before Singh's release,South Korean Oil Minister Lee Bong signed an agreement in Tehran tosell to Iran millions of dollars in spare parts for Iran'sU.S.-made armaments.   It also said Iran agreed to provide the $7 million ransomdemanded by the kidnappers because the United States did not wantto appear to be purchasing their freedom.   The money would be paid indirectly to the kidnappers by Iran inthe form of commissions for Iranian purchases in the United States,according to The Nation.   It said the deal was struck after a group of U.S. citizens whohold Iranian and Lebanese passports were permitted to visitAnderson and one other American hostage in January.   Giora Shamis, owner of the news service that sold the story toThe Nation, told The Associated Press the report was based oninterviews with three of about 15 dual-passport holders involved inthe contacts as well as South Korean sources. Shamis's newsservice, Depth, is based in London.   Al-Anwar quoted two sources it did not identify in the report onWaite.   It said one reported Waite ``has been moved from the Bekaavalley to Beirut's southern suburbs and predicted he will bereleased in 72 hours,'' but the other said he would be freed whenBritain restores diplomatic relations with Syria.   Britain severed relations in November 1986, accusing Syria ofinvolvement in a plot to blow up an Israeli airliner.   Syria is an ally of Iran and has said it was working for releaseof all hostages held in Lebanon. Most are in the hands of ShiiteMoslems loyal to Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, leader of Iran'sfundamentalist revolution.   Syria has an estimated 40,000 soldiers stationed in Moslemsectors of Beirut and northern and eastern Lebanon, including theBekaa valley.   Police said the freed Czechoslovaks were taken to Damascus in aconvoy of evacuees from Beirut a week after their abduction Jan.26, 1987.   ``The kidnappers must have mistaken the blond pair forWesterners and released them after discovering the error,'' aspokesman said privately.</TEXT></DOC>
