It contains a      yarn splicing chamber and a small pipe through which fluid flows, at a      distance from the yarn splicing chamber. The small pipe serves to receive      a yarn end and to prepare it for the splicing process. The small pipe has      a roughened inner surface which makes contact with the yarn end in a      battering manner. In the process for the yarn end preparation, the small      pipe is traversed turbulently by a fluid. The yarn end is battered by the      turbulent flow against the roughened inner surface of the small pipe until      the yarn end is free of twist. </PAL></ABST><PARN> <PAR>  This is a continuation of application Ser. No. 07/635,808, filed Jan. 2,      1991, which is a continuation of Ser. No. 395,807 filed Aug. 18, 1989both      of which are abandoned. </PAR></PARN><BSUM> <PAC>  BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  The instant invention relates to a yarn splicing device for the knot-free      piecing of yarns. The device includes a yarn splicing chamber and a small      pipe through which fluid flows which is installed at a distance from the      yarn splicing chamber to receive a yarn end to be prepared for the      splicing process. The invention also includes a process for the yarn end      preparation in such a yarn splicing device. </PAR><PAR>  In order to achieve good quality in the piecing joint, the piecing of yarn      ends by splicing requires that the preparation of the yarn ends be carried      out with care. The yarn end must be free of twist over a certain length so      that it can be pieced properly in the spinning device to a second yarn end      which is also essentially free of twist. </PAR><PAR>  It is known that the yarn ends are prepared in devices in which said yarn      ends are subjected to a stream of fluid which seizes the yarn at a right      angle to the longitudinal axes of the yarns by means of pressure or      suction force thus produced and which swirls them so that the yarn ends      are untwisted. The preparation of only one yarn end in the known device      shall be described below. </PAR><PAR>  In the known device, the stream of fluid enters a small pipe into which it      pulls or pushes the yarn end at an angle to the longitudinal axis and the      yarn end is untwisted by the turbulent flow thus produced against its      twist. The fibers constituting the yarn end are freed by this flow and are      spread out. Conventional ring spun yarns can be spliced successfully in      this manner. </PAR><PAR>  It is more difficult to splice multiple yarns or threads consisting of two      or more individual strands twisted around each other, where the twist of      the individual strands goes in the opposite direction to the twist of the      yarn constituted by the individual strands twisted around each other.      German Patent No. 3,417,367 deals with such an improvement. According to      this known design, a stream of fluid is brought into each nozzle pipe at      an angle to the longitudinal axis of the nozzle pipe, with the stream of      fluid striking an impact plate installed within the nozzle pipe. When the      stream of fluid strikes the impact plate, turbulent flows are produced in      which the yarn end portion executes non-swirling movements, i.e., pitching      movements and oscillations which causes the twist of the individual      strands to be undone. </PAR><PAR>  Another known device (German Patent No. DE 3,151,270 A1) proposes a more      intensive mechanical and pneumatic stressing of the yarn ends for the same      purpose, that is, to open the yarn ends into individual fibers, to clean      the fibers and to spread them out. This is effected in that the gas under      pressure, streaming at an angle to the longitudinal direction of the      individual fibers, causes the yarn ends to oscillate while at the same      time battering, tearing and pulling mechanical and pneumatic forces act      upon the yarn end. This process is relatively expensive. It, furthermore,      involves the danger that such intensive, violent opening of the yarn ends      causes the individual fibers to be damaged so that they are no longer      suitable for a good splicing joint. </PAR><PAR>  The yarns produced by new spinning methods pose a special problem for      splicing. This applies, in particular, to yarns produced by the open-end      rotor spinning process, in the fiber wind-around spinning process or in      similar new spinning processes. This type of yarn manufacture does not      produce uniform twist in the yarn. Furthermore, these yarns often have      individual fibers wound around the yarn (so-called belly bands) which are      very difficult to undo. The splicing methods used until now have proven to      be of little use for this, and this is the reason why the splicing of such      yarns still presents a problem today. </PAR><PAC>  SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  It is, therefore, the object of the instant invention to provide a process      and a device which makes it possible to splice any kind of yarns in a      simple manner. </PAR><PAR>  This object is attained through the instant invention in that the small      pipe is provided with a rough inner surface which contacts the yarn ends      in a battering manner, and in that a fluid flows turbulently through the      small pipe, with the yarn end being battered by the turbulent stream      against the rough inner surface of the small pipe until the yarn end is      free of twist. </PAR><PAR>  In one embodiment the inner surface of the small pipe is roughed up by      means of diagonal knurling. This is an economical surface treatment of the      inner surface of the small pipe. An irregular arrangement of the edges      facilitates the untwisting of the yarn because the yarn cannot mold itself      so easily to the valleys of the structure. If the surface has sharp edges      the untwisting of the yarn ends is further facilitated. </PAR><PAR>  In order to prepare the yarn end without damaging it, the roughened inner      surface of the small pipe is oriented axially and, within limits, over a      portion of the circumference. Thus, a precisely determined zone of the      yarn end to be untwisted is determined in advance. If the small pipe has      an inside diameter which is a multiple of the yarn thickness, secure      introduction of the yarn end into the small pipe as well as sufficient      movement of the yarn within the pipe is ensured. If the inside diameter is      equal, at the most, to one half the length of the yarn end extending into      the small pipe, very good untwisting results can be obtained in the yarn      end. </PAR><PAR>  Rapid adjustment to different lengths of yarn ends to be untwisted can be      achieved by a shifting adjustment of the small pipe in its axial      direction. In one embodiment, a yarn introduction zone with a diameter      that increases towards the end of the small pipe, e.g., in form of a      conical widening, is provided at the end of the small pipe closest to the      yarn splicing chamber. If the surface of the yarn introduction zone is      also smooth, the introduction of the yarn end into the small pipe is      facilitated. The introduction of the yarn end is further facilitated by      means of a slit located in the yarn introduction zone in the direction of      the longitudinal axis of the small pipe. </PAR><PAR>  If the small pipe is designed so that it can be inserted into the yarn      splicing device in either direction, it is advantageous to ensure that      small pipes with different characteristics in their inner surface      structure can be adapted to different yarn qualities. For this purpose,      the small pipe is rotated so that the yarn insertion takes place, at will,      at one end of the small pipe, and upon rotating the pipe by 180.degree. at      its other end. If a rotatable element in which at least one small pipe is      installed is provided on the yarn splicing device, the small pipe can be      used rapidly and easily for cleaning purposes or used at either side. If      the rotatable element of the small pipe is provided with inner surfaces of      different degrees of roughness, it is possible, and advantageous, to      always use the best-suited small pipe for different yarn qualities. This      is especially advantageous with machines in which different yarn qualities      are produced. This also applies to the small pipe located in the rotatable      element and provided with inner surfaces with different zones of      roughness. </PAR><PAR>  The process, according to the invention, consists in having a turbulent      stream of fluid flowing through the small pipe in which the yarn end is      battered by the turbulent flow against the structured inner surface of the      small pipe so that the yarn end becomes free of twist. It is advantageous      that even stubborn twists, such as occur for example in threads and rotor      yarns with belly band windings, be opened relatively gently by the      battering contact with the structured inner surface. By limiting the      duration of the flow of fluid per yarn end preparation to a given period      of time, a uniform untwisting result is achieved as a function of the yarn      quality being processed at the time. Fluid consumption is also limited      advantageously. A period of less than 30 msec has here proven to be      advantageous for the duration of the fluid stream per yarn end      preparation. </PAR><PAR>  If the fluid for each yarn end preparation is caused to flow through at      intervals, the battering contact between the yarn end and the structured      inner surface of the small pipe is increased by acceleration forces which      are constantly renewed as they act upon the yarn end. </PAR><PAR>  It has been found that the stronger the yarn to be untwisted, or the      stronger the twist in the yarn, the longer the flow of fluid is indicated.      This causes the yarn ends to be battered against the inner surface of the      small pipe for a longer period of time. It has also been found that      greater roughness of the inner surface of the small pipe should be      selected and is advantageous if the yarn to be untwisted is thicker and/or      if the twist of the yarn is stronger. A further possibility of influencing      untwisting of the yarn as a function of yarn quality consists in selecting      greater fluid pressure. This also makes it possible to obtain better      untwisting of the yarn end. </PAR><PAR>  If the fluid is introduced at one end of the small pipe and flows through      the entire length of the small pipe along its axis, an optimal utilization      of the length of the small pipe become possible. The introduction of the      yarn end into the small pipe is facilitated since the yarn end is blown      into the small pipe and is not aspired. Furthermore, such a pressure flow      through the small pipe makes it possible to simplify the design of the      yarn splicing device considerably. </PAR><PAR>  It has been found, surprisingly, that the yarn splicing device and the      process of the invention for the preparation of the yarn ends make it      possible to achieve very good splicing results, even with yarn ends which      have been difficult to free from their wound-around fibers until now, and      at low mechanical expenditure. </PAR></BSUM><DRWD> <PAC>  BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS </PAC><PAR>  FIGS. 1 to 3 show various longitudinal sectional views through a small      pipe; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 4 shows a top view of a small pipe; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 5 shows a cross-sectional view through a divided small pipe; </PAR><PAR>  FIGS. 6 to 8 show various longitudinal sections through yarn splicing      devices with an installed small pipe; and </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 9 shows a cross-sectional view through a yarn splicing device with two      installed small pipes. </PAR></DRWD><DETD> <PAC>  DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  FIG. 2 shows a further embodiment of the small pipe 1 according to the      invention. At the yarn insertion taper 4 and advantageous yarn insertion      groove 5 is provided into which the yarn end 11 positions itself before it      goes into the small pipe 1. Yarn insertion groove 5 stabilizes the yarn      end 11 through its groove-shaped configuration and prevents its lateral      escaping and, thereby, a faulty preparation attempt. </PAR><PAR>  In the small pipe 1 of FIG. 2 a smooth zone G first follows a yarn      insertion zone E on the inner surface 2 of pipe 1. A structured or      textured zone S follows this smooth zone G. By using small pipe 1 the      length of the yarn end 11 to be freed of its twist is limited. A reversal      or untwisting of the twist occurs only as far as the border zone between      smooth and structured zones G, S. With the length of the yarn end 11 being      the same as with the small pipe 1 shown in FIG. 1, a shorter length of the      yarn end 11 is freed of its twist with small pipe 1, as shown in FIG. 2.      The utilization of different small pipes 1 makes it possible to easily      change over a yarn splicing device 20 for yarns with different fiber      lengths, on which the length of the yarn end 11 to be untwisted depends. </PAR><PAR>  The embodiment with a small pipe 1 shown in FIG. 3 represents an inner      surface 2 with a limit of the structured zone S in a portion of the inner      circumference. The smooth zone G of the inner surface 2 occupies the      remaining portion of the inner circumference of the small pipe 1. With      yarns having fibers wound around it with average strength, such an      embodiment ensures gentler untwisting of the yarn end 11 than would be the      case with an overall structured rough inner surface 3, 6 of the small pipe      1. </PAR><PAR>  The combination of the rough inner surface 3, 6 of the small pipes 1 with      smooth surfaces as shown in FIGS. 2 and 3 is advantageous if a limited      piece of the yarn end 11 is to be untwisted gently, since the yarn end 11      is not constantly exposed to the rough inner surface 3, 6. The structure 3      or 6 can be linear or helicoidal, depending on the type of yarn, if the      rough inner surface 3, 6 of the small pipe 1 is disposed axially and over      part of the circumference of the inner surface 2 of the small pipe 1. </PAR><PAR>  Structure 6 of the small pipe 1 in FIG. 3 is different from those shown in      FIGS. 1 and 2 and is not obtained through granulation but through diagonal      knurling of the surface. The structuring of the surface can also be      achieved by means of laser irradiation or erosion. This treatment of the      inner surface 2 is often less costly to manufacture and longer lasting      than to place material against the inner surface 2. </PAR><PAR>  Gentle untwisting of the yarn end 11 is possible according to the pipes of      FIGS. 1 to 3 in that the structure of the inner surface 2 is given more or      less roughness. The rougher and thicker yarn 10, and the narrower and      tighter the twist of yarn 10, the rougher, the more aggressive and the      larger the surface of the structure must be on the inner surface 2 of the      small pipe 1. The mechanical stress to which the yarn end 11 is subjected      is limited to a minimum by the appropriate selection of the structure      surface. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 4 shows a top view of the small pipe 1 in which grains 3 are provided      on the inner surface 2. Here, it can be seen that the sharp edges of the      grains 3 extend into the passage opening of the small pipe 1. The yarn end      11 catches part of its fibers on these sharp edges and dissolves the      structure formed by the fibers while having imparted to it a pitching      movement by the turbulent flow-through of the stream of fluid. The yarn      end 11 is thus transformed into a fiber bundle with spread-out fibers. The      length of the fiber bundle is limited by the average fiber length since      the fibers of the yarn end 11 must have one end remain incorporated into      the yarn in order not to be removed completely from the yarn by the stream      of fluid. </PAR><PAR>  A free inside diameter D is a multiple of the yarn thickness d and is      equal, at the most, to one half of the length of the yarn end 11 extending      into the small pipe 1. This ensures that the yarn end 11 has sufficient      room for its battering movements, on the one hand and on the other hand,      that the rough inner surface 3, 6 makes contact with a sufficient length      of the yarn end 11. </PAR><PAR>  In FIG. 5 a divided design of the small pipe 1 is shown in a section across      its longitudinal axis. The pipe halves 1' and 1&quot; are joined together in      the yarn splicing device 20 by means of adhesive, screwing or clamping.      The division of the small pipe 1 allows for a very simple installation of      the structure on the inner surface 2 of the small pipe 1. The arrangement      of grains 3 as well as the finishing of the inner surfaces 2, according to      FIG. 3, is greatly simplified thanks to good accessibility. If a soluble      bond is used, cleaning or maintenance of the structure is made easier than      in a small pipe 1 that is not divisible. </PAR><PAR>  A longitudinal section through the yarn splicing device 20 and through the      small pipe 1 as seen in FIG. 6 shows the arrangement of the small pipe 1      in the yarn splicing device 20 in one embodiment. The small pipe 1 is      attached in the yarn splicing device 20 so as to be continuously      adjustable in an axial direction. It is clamped in place by a screw 21      which presses against the outer wall of the small pipe 1. By loosening the      screw 21 and shifting the small pipe 1 in an axial direction, a distance A      can be set. The distance A designates the distance between the plane of a      yarn clamping point K and the end of small pipe 1, measured in the      direction of the longitudinal axis of the small pipe 1. By altering      distance A it is possible to adjust the range within which the yarn end 11      is untwisted while the length of the yarn 10 between clamping point K and      yarn end 11 remains constant. The yarn end 11 extends into the small pipe      1 or towards the structured zone S to a greater or lesser extent when the      distance A is altered. </PAR><PAR>  The example of a yarn splicing device 20, shown in FIG. 6, utilizes a small      pipe 1 capable of being used by either side. This small pipe 1 has the      advantage that the range within which the yarn end 11 is to be untwisted      can be enlarged considerably by turning the small pipe, with the position      of the yarn insertion zone E in relation to a yarn splicing chamber 22      remaining essentially the same. </PAR><PAR>  In the type of assembly shown, starting at the side of the yarn insertion,      the yarn insertion zone E, with the yarn insertion groove 5, is followed      by a smooth zone G on the inner surface 2 of the small pipe 1. Untwisting      of the yarn end 11 is not possible against zone G because it is less      aggressive or rough than the structured zone S. The twist of the yarn end      11, which comes into contact with the structured zone S, is opened in the      small pipe 1 as a stream of fluid is blown into it. In the embodiment      shown in FIG. 6 the untwisted yarn end 11 starts only after the smooth      zone G. If the small pipe 1 is turned against a nozzle 30 with the      opening, which is not shown, the structure zone S follows immediately      after the yarn introduction zone E so that the untwisted yarn end 11      becomes longer while the distance A remains the same. </PAR><PAR>  To ensure insertion of the yarn end 11 into the small pipe 1 at any of the      possible positions of the small pipe 1, a yarn insertion tape 4 (with two      yarn insertion grooves 5) is provided at either end of the small pipe 1.      The two insertion grooves 5 ensure that the yarn ends 11 can be laid      across the opening of the small pipe 1 and find a guiding surface in      insertion grooves 5. This ensures that the yarn end 11 is blown into the      small pipe 1 and not to the side, next to small pipe 1. The conical      surfaces of the yarn insertion tapes 4 further increase this effect. In      arrangements in which the inflow of fluid occurs near the small pipe 1 it      is sufficient if only one of the two yarn insertion aids, either the yarn      insertion taper 4 or the yarn insertion groove 5 is provided on the small      pipe 1 or on the yarn splicing device 20. </PAR><PAR>  The nozzle 30 (in FIG. 6) is located as an axial extension of the small      pipe 1. Fluid, preferably air, is blown through the nozzle 30 into the      small pipe 1. The fluid flows through the small pipe 1 and is given a      turbulent flow, in which the yarn end 11 is given a battering motion by      the sharp-edged structure of the inner surface 2 of the small pipe 1. The      yarn end 11 batters against the roughened structure of the inner surface 2      of the small pipe 1 and, thus, frees itself of the fibers that are wound      around it. It is also possible to install the nozzle 30 at the other end      of the small pipe 1, the nozzle being in form of a suction nozzle, for      example, instead of a compressed air nozzle. The fluid is, nevertheless,      always introduced at one end of the small pipe 1 and flows through the      entire length of the small pipe 1 along its axis. </PAR><PAR>  Depending on the thickness of the yarn 10 and/or on the tightness of the      twist of the yarn 10, a fluid pressure of greater or lesser strength is      selected. This makes it possible to obtain the advantage of a gentle      untwisting of the yarn end 11. </PAR><PAR>  A clamp 23 at the yarn splicing chamber 22 presses upon the yarn 10 at a      clamping point K. This ensures that the yarn end 11 is inserted no further      than intended into the small pipe 1 by the stream of fluid coming out of      the nozzle 30. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 7 shows an embodiment in which two small pipes 1a and 1b are placed on      a rotatable part 24. The rotatable part 24 can be brought into two      different working positions in which either the small pipe 1a or the small      pipe 1b can receive the yarn end 11. The nozzle 30 is placed in the axial      continuation of the small pipe 1a so that the yarn end 11 is blown by the      stream of fluid of nozzle 30 into the small pipe 1a. The inner surface 2      of the small pipe 1a is completely structured while the structure of the      inner surface 2 of the small pipe 1b is limited axially. Rotation of the      rotatable part 24 around a rotational axis 25 in the direction of the      arrow makes it possible to replace the small pipe 1a with the small pipe      1b. After a rotation of the rotatable part 24 by 180.degree., it is no      longer the small pipe 1a but the small pipe 1b through which the stream of      fluid flows. </PAR><PAR>  The two small pipes 1a and 1b can be different with respect to the      arrangement of the structure 3a, 3b as well as with respect to the      thickness of the structure 3a, 3b, and can meet the requirement for the      most gentle yarn end preparation of different yarns 10. </PAR><PAR>  The adjustment of the rotatable part 24 can be achieved manually as well as      mechanically by means of a service unit, for example. </PAR><PAR>  In the rotatable part 24 in the yarn splicing device 20 according to FIG.      8, only one small pipe 1 is provided. The rotational axis 25 is      perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the small pipe 1 and cuts      through it in the middle. If the rotatable part is rotated by 180.degree.,      it is possible to utilize the small pipe 1 alternately by either side and      to, thus, vary the length of the yarn end 11 to be untwisted in the pipe. </PAR><PAR>  The nozzle 30 is preceded by a control device 31 which influences the      arrival of the fluid. The arrival of the fluid coming from a pressure      container 32 and going into the nozzle is stopped after each untwisting      process and is readmitted again only for a new untwisting process. The      control device or valve 31 limits the through-flow of fluid per yarn end      preparation to a period of less than 30 ms. The fluid flow-through depends      on the strength of the twist of yarn end 11. If the twist of the yarn end      11 is strong and/or uneven, i.e., if there are prominent bellies or fiber      bands, or if the twist is in form of a Z as well as in form of an S, a      longer period of flow-through is required in order to reverse the twist      than is the case with a loose twist. If the fluid flows at intervals,      i.e., if the fluid stream is constantly and briefly interrupted or      weakened, the shock-like impact of the fluid on the yarn end 11 and the      resulting acceleration peaks at which the yarn end 11 is thrown with great      force against the sharp-edged structure on the inner surface 2 of the      small pipe 1 and results in very good opening and untwisting of the yarn      end 11. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 9 shows a cross-section through a yarn splicing device 20 in which two      small pipes 1a and 1b are provided in the rotatable part 24. The      rotational axis 25 of the rotatable part 24 is parallel and centric with      respect to the longitudinal axes of the small pipes 1a and 1b. By rotating      the rotatable part 24 in the direction of the arrow it is, therefore,      possible to let the fluid stream flow through the different small pipes 1a      or 1b by bringing them alternately within range of the fluid stream      emerging from the nozzle 30. With this design of the yarn splicing device      20 it is possible to free yarn ends of different qualities from their      twist with either small pipe 1a or 1b, as best suited in each case. </PAR><PAR>  In the arrangement with respect to the rotational axis 25 of the rotatable      part 24 as shown in FIG. 9, it is also possible to provide small pipes for      more than two yarn qualities. This can be done in the manner of a revolver      magazine in which several small pipes are arranged in a circle around the      rotational axis 25. The small pipe best suited for the yarn quality to be      spliced at a given time is then selected by rotating the rotatable part 24      into the position in which the fluid flows through it. </PAR><PAR>  The instant invention is not limited to the embodiments shown and described      as examples. Thus, it is also possible to arrange a number of small pipes      on a band or on a chain and to move the best-suited small pipe      automatically or manually to the location of fluid flow. To do this, it is      also possible to use a microprocessor which selects the best-suited small      pipe, the best-suited duration of fluid flow-through, and the flow      progress by means of a program as a function of the yarn quality. </PAR></DETD><CLMS> <STM>  We claim: </STM><NUM>  1. </NUM><PAR>  1.
