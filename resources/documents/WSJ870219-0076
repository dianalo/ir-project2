In December and January, 305 companies raised their dividends, an increase of 21 over a year earlier. Not startling, says Arnold Kaufman, editor of Standard andamp; Poor's Corp.'s Outlook, but significant because &quot;there are a number of reasons why dividends shouldn't be going up.&quot; Among them: a cash-flow crunch caused by some provisions in the new tax law and the fact that companies usually don't raise dividends late in an economic expansion.    An improved corporate earnings outlook is responsible for some increases. Dividends paid in 1986 represented 54% of company earnings, but the same dollars would account for only 47% of projected 1987 earnings, says David Conine, equity group manager of Merrill Lynch andamp; Co. &quot;There's certainly some room for dividend growth,&quot; he says. Some companies also are courting investors, knowing the new tax law will treat dividends the same as capital gains, he says.    The number of increases peaked in 1978 at 3,211 and has been decreasing since then; 1986, the lowest year since 1971, had only 1,515 increases.    MEAT-COUNTER COMPETITION heats up as packers stress marketing.    Beef, pork and veal packers are moving to catch up to the chicken industry with branded and partially prepared products. Wilson Foods Corp. rolls out Tender Cuts, pre-packaged, boneless fresh pork treated to be more juicy. In June, Excel Corp. introduced name-brand beef, which arrives prep-riced and ready for the meat counter. Now selling in 120 grocery stores, the beef has a longer shelf life than traditional store cuts because it is vacuum-packed.    The shift to value-added products from the old commodity-type selling is long overdue, some say. &quot;We don't sell flour out of a barrel, or pickles or crackers,&quot; says Excel's Herbert Meischen, predicting that pre-packaging will be the way all beef will be sold in the U.S. within 10 years. That means increased competition for shelf space. Veal producers already are mounting a campaign to increase veal display. &quot;The consumer's stomach is only so big,&quot; says Mary Burnette of the American Meat Institute, predicting increasingly aggressive marketing.    FOREIGN TOURISTS head to the U.S. seeking bargain vacations.    Visits by Europeans soared 28% in 1986 and are expected to increase 9% this year, says the U.S. Travel andamp; Tourism Administration. The major reason: the declining dollar. Tourism from Japan is growing so fast that Japan is projected to surpass Mexico -- currently No. 2 -- as a source of visitors by 1988. All told, some 22.8 million travelers from abroad are expected to visit the U.S. this year. &quot;It's just as if there is a huge price discount,&quot; says John Murphy, an American Express Co. vice president.    Popular destinations for foreigners include New York City, California and Florida. The influx shouldn't create a crunch for Americans vacationing at home, thanks to a glut of hotel rooms, says Charles Goeldner, editor of Journal of Travel Research. One exception may be the national parks since &quot;the parks are traditionally full in the summer months,&quot; says American Express's Mr. Murphy.    But fancy hotel rooms are already harder to book as foreign business travelers find their money buys more, says Craig Parsons of Hyatt Hotels Corp.    LAWYERS' LAMENT: According to a survey of young lawyers for the American Bar Association's ABA Journal, 21% chose law because they &quot;didn't know what else to do.&quot; The biggest surprise for 25% of those surveyed: &quot;The amount of money I'm not making.&quot; More than two-thirds earn less than $50,000 a year from practicing law.    PIZZA ON THE WING is offered by Sky Pies Inc. at Chicago's O'Hare Airport. Packaged to stay frozen for 12 hours, the pizzas come from such popular Chicago eateries as Nancy's. Prices range from $10 to $15.    ADS BY TELEPHONE: InfoPlus Inc. in Needham, Mass, distributes &quot;Yellow Pages Plus, The Talking Phonebook.&quot; Call a number from the book, add four extra digits and you get an electronically recorded message, such as the daily special at a restaurant.    MORE SHOPPING MALLS issue their own credit cards to increase sales.    The cards, designed to provide malls with new marketing tools, are gaining ground. &quot;The increased profitability of credit cards in a low interest-rate environment makes credit cards a pretty hot item if you can find a way to get people to accept them,&quot; says Stuart Feldstein of SMR Research Corp., Budd Lake, N.J. The success of mall cards in Puerto Rico &quot;shows they can really take market share from bank credit cards,&quot; he says.    Banco Popular de Puerto Rico, with 350,000 cards in active use, entered the mainland U.S. market last fall and already has five malls in Florida. Edward J. DeBartolo Corp., the largest U.S. shopping-center developer, plans to have cards at all 55 of its centers by the end of 1988. Cards are so successful at some California malls that nearby shops also accept them.    But mall-card financer Avco National Bank has yet to sign up a big department store because of problems integrating computer systems.
