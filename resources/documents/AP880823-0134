Thornburgh saidTuesday he is taking a ``second look'' at the last-minute order ofEdwin Meese III calling for special investigations of members ofCongress suspected of criminal wrongdoing.   ``I want to find out what the underlying premise was in theissuance of the order,'' the former Pennsylvania governor said inone of his first interviews since being sworn in on Aug. 12.   Thornburgh's comments came as Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., chairmanof a governmental affairs subcommittee, asked the attorney generalto rescind the order because the public didn't have a chance tocomment on it, and it contains a drafting error and other problems.   Hours before Meese left the attorney general's post on Aug. 12,he signed the regulation that requires his successors to appoint anindependent counsel to investigate allegations of wrongdoing madeagainst a senator or congressman.   Meese, who was twice investigated by independent counsels duringhis 7{ years as a Reagan administration official, said his orderwas designed to ensure that legislators and top executive officialsare treated equitably. The 1978 Ethics in Government Act allowsexecutive-branch employees to be investigated by specialprosecutors, but not members of Congress.   Thornburgh, 56, a former head of the Justice Department'scriminal division in the Ford Administration, said it was ``prettywell known that I see a very limited role for specialprosecutors-independent counsels in the process of investigatingand prosecuting criminal cases.''   In general, he said that U.S. attorneys and the department'soffice of public integrity, which investigates corruption of publicofficials, do a fine job pursuing allegations of criminal conduct.Thornburgh, once a prosecutor in Pittsburgh, established the publicintegrity office in the mid-1970s.   ``I guess what I am curious about is what is being proposed ...a cure where there is no disease'' he said. ``I am taking whatcould be called fairly a second look at that order.''   He said he had no idea when his review might be completed, butit will include talking to an advisory committee of U.S. attorneys.   Thornburgh, a friend and supporter of Vice President GeorgeBush, refused to talk about Bush's selection of Indiana Sen. DanQuayle as his running mate.   ``I am really not comfortable talking about issues in thepolitical realm from this position,'' said Thornburgh, whose namewas bandied about as possible vice presidential candidate beforeBush tapped Quayle.   Thornburgh said he will not campaign for Bush and has nocommitment that he will remain as attorney general if Bush wins inNovember.   During the next five months, Thornburgh said he will guide thedepartment by setting high standards for professional conduct andaggressively pursuing the war on drugs and other criminal activity.   He has initiated an overall assessment of the department,evaluating its staff and budgetary needs and looking at whichvacancies need to be filled. ``The responsibility I have to thepresident is to take stock and make sure everything is shipshape.''   Asked how he planned to boost morale at the department after theMeese era, Thornburgh said, ``You lead by example ... My view ofthe department is one that requires an absolute fidelity to highstandards of professional conduct and integrity in our operations.''   While Meese was attorney general there were widespreaddefections among the top ranks at the department; some officialsexpressed unhappiness with the attention Meese was forced to giveto his personal troubles.   James C. McKay, the special prosecutor who investigated Meese,concluded the then-attorney general probably brokeconflict-of-interest and tax laws, but McKay said he found no basisto seek criminal charges against Meese. Meese said the reportvindicated him.   As a result of McKay's report, the department's office ofprofessional responsiblity, which looks into the conduct of Justiceemployees, started a review of Meese's conduct to see if it metethical standards. Thornburgh said he had no idea when that reportwould be completed.</TEXT></DOC>
