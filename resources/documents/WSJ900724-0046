Sir James, whose investment group owns 29.9% of RanksHovis McDougall PLC, is urging the major British baker andfood producer to expand into Europe &quot;instead of buying brandsin the U.S.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   &quot;There are two natural opportunities for RHM: WesternEurope, where the market is fragmented, and Eastern Europe,where the food industry is retarded, insufficient andinefficient,&quot; Sir James said in an interview in Paris. &quot;InEastern Europe, you've got the opportunity not for productslike pheasant in aspic, but good-quality healthful foods.&quot;   The Ranks Hovis stake is Sir James's last remainingholding of his investment vehicle, Anglo Group PLC, whichoffered holders a small part of its Ranks Hovis stake inexchange for Anglo common and bonds.   Ranks Hovis has some of its own ideas about business. Thecompany agreed to sell its breakfast cereal operation to CPWS.A., a joint venture of General Mills of the U.S. and NestleS.A. of Switzerland, for #93 million (US$167 million).   In Windsor, England, Bob Rogerson, Ranks Hovis financedirector, said &quot;we don't disagree&quot; with Sir James's viewsabout Western Europe. &quot;We have a natural affinity for WesternEurope -- but we can't be everywhere.&quot; And, he said, thesituation in Eastern Europe &quot;is less clear -- those marketsaren't so well-developed, nor are the countries wealthy.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
