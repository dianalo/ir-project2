About 20 bystanders and a police officer also were injured inthe melee Sunday, which took 100 police officers more than threehours to quell, police said. Police estimated at least 50 peoplewere arrested.   ``I'm trembling _ I'm in pure fear,'' said Mayda Ramirez, one ofat least 5,000 visitors at the Central American Independence DayFestival in Tropical Park.   The violence began when someone fired a gun into the crowd andhit a young man in the shoulder, police said. ``It appears to besome gang-related activities that got out of control veryquickly,'' said Metro Police Chief Fred Taylor.   Bottles flew, and young men carrying sticks moved through thecrowds, sending spectators into a mad dash.   ``You would just be standing there, and they'd come up and hityou,'' said Dawn Santiago, who ducked into a lemonade stand forcover. ``We just ran in, there was no time to think.''   For more than three hours the youths played cat-and-mouse withofficers, who ran down and tackled many of the young men.   A man with a gunshot wound in the chest and another who was shotin the buttocks were in stable condition at Baptist Hospital, saidemergency room nurse Jose Segarre.   A police officer and a concert-goer who were hit in the headwith bottles and two women who suffered heat exhaustion were alsotreated at the hospital.</TEXT></DOC>
