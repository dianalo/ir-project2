Accelerationof heat exchange in the cooling zone with improvement in its thermaland gas insulation is an important step in reducing the fuel consumptionin kilns. With identical effectiveness of the thermal operation of thecooling zone the parameters of the secondary air supplied for combustiondo not have a significant influence on the total fuel consumption inthe furnace but do determine to a significant degree the operating conditionsof its burners.</TEXT></DOC>
