Because of a recession-induced slump in demand for itsconstruction and farm equipment, Caterpillar has through thefirst nine months racked up a loss of $86 million, or 85cents a share, on sales that declined 11% to $7.72 billion.   The company forecast that the current quarter's net lossis likely to exceed the year-to-date deficit, but declined toprovide a more specific projection.   &quot;Weak economic conditions throughout much of the world,&quot;the company said, continue to depress results. &quot;While leadingeconomic indicators are signaling the beginning of a recoveryin the U.S.,&quot; Caterpillar said, improvements in the marketsit serves are expected to lag behind an upturn in theeconomy. While Caterpillar said it expects domestic marketsto strengthen in 1992, &quot;conditions outside the U.S. arelikely to remain difficult.&quot;   Reflecting that outlook, the company said its currentquarter's earnings will also be hurt by charges to cut itsEuropean work force, primarily at its constructionequipmentoperation in Gosselies, Belgium. About 800 European workerswill lose their jobs, including 500 of the about 4,175currently employed at Gosselies.   The quarter's results will also include a charge forwriting down previously closed U.S. plants &quot;to recognizelower market values&quot; for the sites, which it is seeking tosell.   A wild card in the company's prospects is the strife thathas broken out between the company and some 16,000 workersrepresented by the United Auto Workers. After talks failedover a contract to replace the one that expired Sept. 30,about 2,400 UAW employees launched a limited strike earlythis month, and Caterpillar swiftly hit back by locking outabout 5,600 other union workers.   While the current slow market and Caterpillar's bigstockpile of unsold goods serve to insulate the company fromthe effects of the limited work stoppage, the standoff istaking a toll. Earlier this week, Caterpillar laid off morethan 300 other workers because of the strike's effects.   Saying that &quot;a quick resolution of the labor difficultiesis unlikely,&quot; Moody's Investors Service Inc. yesterday placedCaterpillar's about $2.7 billion of long-term debt underreview; the rating company plans to &quot;evaluate the impact of apotentially prolonged strike on Caterpillar's competitiveposition and financial condition.&quot;   Moody's characterized the other charges as &quot;small relativeto the company's overall capital structure.&quot;   In addition, Caterpillar disclosed that it expectsaccommodating a recent accounting change will requireafter-tax charges of up to $2.4 billion. The charge, which ithas until early 1993 to take, is to cover adoption ofStatement of Financial Accounting Standards 106. SFAS 106,which all U.S. companies are required to adopt, requires thatemployers set up a reserve for post-retirement healthbenefits, and companies have to take a big &quot;catch-up&quot; chargewhen they make the switch.</TEXT></DOC>
