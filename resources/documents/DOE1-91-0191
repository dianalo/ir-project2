The Liouville equations are obtained.These are functional Wigner equation in the bosonic case, and functionalNaiman equation in the fermionic case. the Green functions of a classicalLiouville equation is obtained in the form of a path integral. Theseare necessary to construct the perturbation theory in the vivinity ofthe classical field. It is shown that the fermion path integral can berepresented in {delta}-functional form if a fermionic field interactswith a classical field. 19 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
