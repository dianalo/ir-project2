Meanwhile, OPEC Secretary-General Subroto of Indonesia said hewas optimistic that eventual peace between Iran and Iraq, two majorGulf oil producers, will help the cartel.   ``With the cessation of the hostilities OPEC will have a greaterdegree of cohesion that will enable it to more effectively helpstabilize the oil market,'' Subroto told a press briefing after theone-day meeting.   In its final communique, the pricing committee said it wasconcerned about a ``serious deterioration in prices'' since OPEC'slast full meeting in June.   It said the problem resulted ``mainly from the supply overhangin the market caused by a significant overproduction in the face ofhuge stock buildups, overproduction from some OPEC members as wellas high-level production from non-OPEC oil producers.''   No alleged offenders were named.   The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries had pledged tosupport an average oil price of $18 a barrel, but world marketprices have fallen below that level.   The five-nation pricing committee, comprising oil ministers fromVenezuela, Nigeria, Saudi Arabia, Indonesia and Algeria, met behindclosed doors at a luxury hotel.   The group reviewed the OPEC auditors' report for the cartel'sMay production and estimates from outside sources for June and Julyproduction.   Auditors Klynveld Kraaijenhof andamp; Co. said the 12 OPEC membercountries produced 15.181 million barrels a day of oil in May, upfrom 14.86 million barrels a day in April.   The report indicated that production by the all OPEC membersrose further during June, without giving specific figures for therise.   Subroto said he was given a mandate for further consultationswith all 12 OPEC member countries on several issues pending for theorganization, ahead of its next ministerial conference scheduledfor November.   He said he will report on the consultations to the monitoringcommittee, which will then decide if an extraordinary conference iswarranted.   ``As of now, we don't think an emergency meeting is calledfor,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
