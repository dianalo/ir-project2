Mario David Garcia, director of the station's newscast ``Here,the World,'' is one of five civilians and six military officerscharged in a May 11 coup attempt. He was a presidential candidatefor the rightist Authentic National Center party in the 1985elections won by Cerezo.   Max Kestler Farnes, president of Channel 3 television, read aletter over the air Thursday from the government's National Radioand Television Department that said the station had broadcast``material considered dangerous for state security'' and would beclosed ``until further notice.''   Enrique Hernandez, acting director of the department, confirmedFriday he had signed and sent the letter.   The station, which has been broadcasting for 32 years,interrupted the film ``The Ten Commandments'' to read the letterand then left the air.   Cerezo, a Christian Democrat, is the first civilian presidentsince 1970 and the second in more than 30 years of military andmilitary-dominated governments.   Two weeks before the May 11 coup attempt, Garcia read on the aira communique that said the political process ``has been betrayed bya corrupt clique'' of communists, military leaders and ChristianDemocrats.   In a speech Thursday, Cerezo denied the charge.   ``Everyone who says those lies is an enemy of stability andwants Guatemala to return to violence, which favors the subversivegroups who want to destroy democratic society and establishauthoritarian society,'' he said.   The term ``subversive'' is commonly used by Guatemalan officialsto refer to leftist guerrillas fighting for 27 years to overthrowthe nation's governments.   An estimated 100,000 people have died since 1954 and 40,000disappeared in the past 20 years in violence by the extreme rightand left, a guerrilla war and a brutal army anti-rebel campaign inthe late 1970s and early 1980s.   In another development, the Secret Anti-Communist Army claimedresponsibility for an attack Wednesday on the home of thecorrespondent for the Soviet news agency Tass.   Two grenades exploded at the home, shattering windows,destroying a metal door and damaging his vehicle, correspondentAlejandro Trouchine said.   The communique, published Friday in local newspapers, alsoexpressed support for the news program ``Here, the World'' andthreatened to take action against the Nicaraguan ambassador andChristian Democrats if attempts are made to arrest the fivecivilians accused in the coup attempt.</TEXT></DOC>
