The effect of the proposed rulemaking is to implement recentamendments to FOIA contained in FOIRA. Those amendments concern Exemption7 of the FOIA (concerning law enforcement records) and the provisions ofthe FOIA concerning fees and fee waivers. In addition, the proposed rulemakingimplements Executive Order 12600, which deals with predisclosure notificationprocedures for confidential commercial information. This proposed rulemakingalso makes technical, clarifying changes to the OCC's existing FOIA regulation.This proposed rulemaking, and the OCC's FOIA regulation in general, affectpublic disclosure of information by the OCC.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATE:</T2> Comments must be received on or before October 10, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESSES:</T2> Comments should be mailed or delivered to Docket No.89-<T3>10</T3>, Communications Division, 5th Floor, 490 L'Enfant Plaza East,SW., Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Washington, DC 20219, Attention:Jacqueline England.

FOIRA requires Federalagencies to issue regulations establishing a schedule of fees and proceduresfor determining when fees should be waived or reduced. The fee scheduleis to be in conformance with guidelines issued by the Office of Managementand Budget (OMB). The FOIRA modified Exemption 7 of the FOIA, which exempts from public disclosurecertain records or information compiled for law enforcement purposes, inthree ways: (1) It added language to allow for an exemption based on areasonable expectation of any number of specified harms from disclosure;(2) it added explanatory language describing a confidential source; and(3) it provided an exemption from disclosure if release of the information``would disclose techniques and procedures for law enforcement investigationsor prosecutions, or would disclose guidelines for law enforcement investigationsor prosecutions if such disclosure could reasonably be expected to riskcircumvention of the law.'' This Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) incorporatesthese FOIRA amendments into the OCC's FOIA regulations at 12 CFR 4.16(b)(7).The FOIRA also significantly amended the fee provision of the FOIA by establishingfive classes of FOIA requesters: (1) Commercial; (2) educational institutions;(3) noncommercial scientific institutions; (4) representatives of the newsmedia; and (5) all others. Commercial requesters will be charged for thedirect costs of review, search and duplication of records. Educationalinstitutions, noncommercial scientific institutions and representativesof the news media will be charged fees for direct costs of duplicationwith the first 100 pages provided free of charge. All other requesterswill be charged fees for search and duplication, with two hours of searchtime and 100 pages of duplication provided free of charge. Prior to theFOIRA, requesters were not classified and charges were made in all casesfor search and duplication; <T3>i.e., </T3>unless fees were specifically waived or reduced, all requesterswere charged the same fees. In addition, the FOIRA amended the FOIA with respect to waiver or reductionof fees. Under FOIRA, documents are to be furnished without a fee or witha reduced fee if ``disclosure of the information is in the public interestbecause it is likely to contribute significantly to public understandingof the operations or activities of the government and is not primarilyin the commercial interest of the requester.'' Prior to the FOIRA, thewaiver or reduction of fees occurred when an agency determined that suchwaiver or reduction was in the ``public interest because furnishing theinformation can be considered as primarily benefiting the general public.''Proposed andSection; 4.17(g) incorporates the OCC's new schedule for thecharging and waiving of fees. Executive Order 12600 Confidential Commercial Information Executive Order 12600 (52 FR 23781,June 25, 1987) requires each Executive department and agency subject toFOIA to establish procedures to notify submitters of records containingconfidential commercial information when those records are requested underFOIA. Under this NPRM, a submitter of confidential commercial informationwill have an opportunity to make written objections to disclosure and tostate all grounds upon which disclosure is opposed. Furthermore, such asubmitter will be notified whenever a FOIA requester institutes a suitseeking to compel disclosure of the confidential commercial informationprovided to the OCC by the business submitter. Proposed andSection; 4.18(d)implements Executive Order 12600. <ITAG tagnum="84">OMB and Department of Justice (DOJ) Guidelines </ITAG>The portion of the NPRM dealing with the fee schedule contains the basicrequirements of the FOIRA and also reflects OMB's guidelines, which theFOIRA required OMB to publish. OMB's proposed and final guidelines werepublished at 52 FR 1982 (January 16, 1987) and 52 FR 10012 (March 27, 1987),respectively. While the numbering system and titles of some subsectionsin this NPRM differ from the OMB guidelines, the substance of the ruleis similar in all material respects.Proposed andSection; 4.17(g)(2)(vii) is based upon guidelines issued by DOJ.The DOJ guidelines were not published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>, but are available upon request from the OCCat the address listed above under the heading ``For Further InformationContact''. Furthermore, the proposed rule includes numerous editorial changes;for example, portions have been rewritten for clarity and organizationalupdates have been made to include address changes as well as changes inthe names of offices. <ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Flexibility Analysis </ITAG>Pursuant to section 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, the Comptrollerof the Currency certifies that these changes, if adopted as proposed, willnot have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of smallentities. Accordingly, a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis is not required.<ITAG tagnum="84">Executive Order 12291 </ITAG>The OCC has determined that this NPRM does not constitute a major rulewithin the meaning of Executive Order 12291. Accordingly, a RegulatoryImpact Analysis will not be required on the grounds that this revision(1) would not have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more,(2) would not result in a major increase in the cost of bank operationsor governmental supervision, and (3) would not have a significant adverseeffect on competition (foreign or domestic), employment, investment, productivity,or innovation. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 12 CFR Part 4 </ITAG>National banks, Public disclosure, FOIA exemptions, Criminal investigations,Schedule of fees, Waivers or reductions of fees, and notice prior to disclosure.For the reasons set forth in the preamble, Title 12, Chapter I, Part 4of the Code of Federal Regulations is proposed to be amended as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 4_[AMENDED] </ITAG>1.

(2)<T3> Fees. </T3>The OCC may charge fees that recoup the full allowabledirect costs it incurs. The OCC may contract with non-government enterprisesto locate, reproduce, and/or disseminate records; provided however, thatthe OCC has determined that the ultimate cost to the requester will beno greater than it would be if the OCC performed these tasks itself. Inno case will the OCC contract out responsibilities which the FOIA providesthat the OCC alone may discharge, such as determining the applicabilityof an exemption or whether to waive or reduce fees. Fees are subject tochange as costs change. (i)<T3> Searches other than for computerized records. </T3>The OCC shall chargefor records at the salary rate(s) (<T3>i.e., </T3>basic pay plus 16 percent) of the employee(s) making thesearch.

If so notifiedby the OCC, the requester will have an opportunity to confer with personnelof the OCC in order to revise the request in hopes of meeting his or herneeds at a lower cost. The administrative time limits in subsection (a)(6)of the FOIA (<T3>i.e.</T3>, 10 business days from the receipt of initial requests and20 business days from the receipt of appeals from an initial denial, pluspermissible extensions of these time limits) will begin only after theOCC receives a revised request from the requester.

(viii)<T3> Waiving or reducing fees. </T3>The OCC shall waive or reduce feesunder this section whenever, in its opinion, disclosure of informationis in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantlyto public understanding of the operations or activities of the governmentand is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester. (A) The following factors will be used in determining whether a waiveror reduction of fees is in the public interest: (<T3>1</T3>) The subject of the request_Whether the subject of the requestedrecords concerns the operations or activities of the government; (<T3>2</T3>) The informative value of the information to be disclosed_Whetherthe disclosure is likely to contribute to an understanding of governmentoperations or activities; (<T3>3</T3>) The contribution to an understanding of the subject by thegeneral public_Whether disclosure of the requested information will contributeto public understanding of the subject; (<T3>4</T3>) The significance of the contribution to public understanding_Whetherthe disclosure is likely to contribute significantly to public understandingof government operations or activities. (B) If the public interest requirement is met, the OCC will then make adetermination on the ``commercial interest'' requirement, based upon thefollowing factors: (<T3>1</T3>) The existence and magnitude of a commercial interest_Whetherthe requester has a commercial interest that would be furthered by therequested disclosure; and, if so, (<T3>2</T3>) The primary interest in disclosure_Whether the magnitude ofthe identified commercial interest of the requester is sufficiently largein comparison with the public interest in disclosure, that disclosure isreasonably considered by the OCC to be primarily in the commercial interestof the requester.(C) The OCC, if the required public interest exists and the requester'scommercial interest is not primary in comparison to that public interest,may waive or reduce the fees that would normally be charged to that requester.(3) <T3>Categories of requesters</T3>_ (i) <T3>Commercial use requesters. </T3>The OCC may assess fees for commercialuse requesters which recover the allowable costs of search, review, andduplication. Commercial use requesters are not entitled to two hours offree search time nor 100 free pages of duplication of documents. (ii) <T3>Requesters who are representatives of the news media, as well as educationaland noncommercial scientific institution requesters. </T3>The OCC willprovide documents to requesters in these categories for the cost of duplicationalone. No fee will be assessed for the first 100 pages. (iii) <T3>All other requesters. </T3>The OCC will assess fees for requesterswho do not fit into any of the above categories to recover the full reasonabledirect cost of search and duplication. No fees will be assessed for thefirst 100 pages of duplication or the first two hours of search time. (4) <T3>Interest on unpaid fees. </T3>The OCC may begin assessing interestcharges on an unpaid bill for FOIA-related fees on the 31st day followingthe day on which the bill was sent. Interest will be at the rate prescribedin 31 U.S.C. 3717. (5) <T3>Fees for unsuccessful search and review. </T3>The OCC may assess feesfor time spent in search and review, even if the records requested arenot located or if the records located are exempt from disclosure. (6) <T3>Aggregating requests. </T3>A FOIA requester(s) may not file multiplerequests, each seeking portions of a document or documents, in order toavoid payment of fees. If this is done, the OCC may aggregate the requestsand charge accordingly. The OCC will not aggregate multiple FOIA requestson unrelated subjects from the same requester. (7) <T3>Advance payment of fees. </T3>FOIA requesters must include a statementagreeing to pay all fees that are properly charged by the OCC; however,the OCC will not require a FOIA requester to make an advance payment, unless:(i) The OCC estimates or determines that the fees the requester may berequired to pay are likely to exceed $250. If it appears that the feeswill exceed $250, the OCC will notify the requester of the likely costand obtain satisfactory assurance of full payment, where the requesterhas a history of prompt payment of FOIA fees; in the case of requesterswith no history of payment, the OCC will require an advance payment ofthe full estimated charges that will be incurred; or (ii) A requester has previously failed to pay a fee in a timely fashion(within 30 days of the date of the billing). The OCC may require such arequester to pay the full amount owed plus any applicable interest, asprovided in paragraph (g)(4) of this section, or demonstrate that the feeowed has been paid. The OCC may also require this type of FOIA requesterto make an advance payment of the full amount of the estimated fees beforethe OCC begins to process a new request, or finishes the processing ofa pending request. (8) <T3>Tolling of administrative time limits. </T3>When the OCC takes actionunder paragraphs (g)(7) (i) or (ii) of this section, the administrativetime limits prescribed in subsection (a)(6) of the FOIA begin only afterthe OCC has received the fee payments described. 6. Section 4.18 is amended by adding a new paragraph (d) to read as follows:<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 4.18 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Other rules of disclosure. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="37">* * * * * </ITAG>(d) <T3>Procedures for protecting the confidentiality of commercial informationas required bv Executive Order 12600_ </T3>(1) <T3>Definitions. </T3>For purposes of this section, the following definitionsshall apply: (i) <T3>Confidential commercial information </T3>means records provided tothe OCC by a submitter which arguably contain material exempt from releaseunder Exemption 4 of the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), because disclosurecould reasonably be expected to cause substantial competitive harm to thesubmitter thereof.
