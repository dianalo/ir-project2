The three-year contract agreement was announced shortly beforethe midnight strike deadline by Louis J. Gambaccini, general managerof the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority, and RogerTauss, president of Transport Workers Union Local 234.   ``We think we have, what is in our opinion, a fair agreement allaround,'' Gambaccini said. ``It was a tough, tough negotiation.   ``I would like to say that the union has been admirable in itsseriousness in its approach and we tried to respect that. I couldnot have asked for a better, earnest effort,'' he said.   Tauss also said he was happy with the agreement.   Gambaccini and Tauss refused to reveal any terms of the agreementuntil a union membership meeting Wednesday.   The sticking point in negotiations had been wages, pensions andSEPTA's demand that the union absorb projected increases inhealth-care costs by paying some of the premiums or approving a cutin benefits.   The authority has projected its health care costs would increasefrom a current $20 million to $30 million in the next three years.   The news left workers gathered at a North Philadelphia depotrelieved.   ``I feel good about the news, because I know if they got us acontract, they got us a hell of a good one, and I know we don't haveany Blue Cross-Blue Shield to pay,'' said Jean Alexander, a unionspokeswoman.   Leaders of Local 234, which represents about 5,200 city bus,trolley and subway operators, had said the strike would begin at12:01 a.m. Wednesday, when the contract expired, if there was noagreement.   Contract negotiations had resumed with a state mediator orderingboth sides to avoid public statements after transit workers hintedthere was nothing on the table to head off the city's fourth transitstrike in 12 years.   Before the announcement, police prepared to put extra officers ontraffic control duty for the Wednesday morning rush, and the BicycleCoaltion of Delaware Valley set up a phone line to offer informationon bicycle routes.   The authority told commuters it would add trains to regional raillines, which would not be affected, and make more stops through thecity.   The transit workers last struck for four days in 1986. Previouswalkouts included a 44-day strike in 1977, a 19-day strike in 1981,a 108-day strike in 1983.</TEXT></DOC>
