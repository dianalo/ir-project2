However, declining Nasdaq issuesstill outnumbered advancers at the close.

Theindex closed with a gain of 0.99, or 0.20%, to 507.10. It hasrisen nearly 27 points, or 5.6%, since its most recent losingsession May 20.   Declining Nasdaq issues, though, outpaced advancers, 959to 889. National Market System volume eased to 109,900,000shares from 125,230,000 Friday.   Big Board stocks also finished mixed. The New York StockExchange Composite Index dropped 0.81, or 0.38%, while theDow Jones Industrial Average advanced 7.83, or 0.26%.   Wheat First's Mr. Jennison said stock market investors areclosely monitoring the bond market for indications on thedirection of interest rates. &quot;Any impetus to lower rates . .. would be incredibly positive for the stock market,&quot; hesaid.   While Mr. Jennison said yesterday's late recovery instocks bodes well for the market in coming sessions, hebelieves trading activity will continue to slacken ahead ofFriday's Labor Department report on May employment levels.   &quot;I think we are looking for a moderately recoveringeconomy,&quot; said Mr. Jennison of the employment statistics.Indications in the report that the economy is too weak woulddiscourage investors hoping for a rebound in corporateprofits, while signs that the economy is overheated would bepoorly received by investors looking for further rate cuts bythe Federal Reserve Board.   Even though both Nasdaq and exchange-listed stocks haverallied over the past two weeks on hopes for an imminent endto the recession in the U.S. economy, Mitch Meisler,executive vice president world-wide equities at LehmanBrothers, said his firm doesn't believe a recovery &quot;is firmlyat hand.&quot;   Said Mr. Meisler: &quot;I'm wary about making bets on companieswhose fortunes are going to be tied to an early and strongrecovery in the economy.&quot; Lehman believes that it could takeuntil the &quot;latter part of the year&quot; for strong signs of aneconomic rebound to emerge, Mr. Meisler said.   Continued weakness in the economy may be enough to spurinterest-rate easing by the Federal Reserve. Because of thisprospect, Mr. Meisler said some Nasdaq financial stocks maybe poised for shareprice gains.   &quot;A lot of the regional banks represent good value here,&quot;he said. Financial issues &quot;could be another area ofleadership in the not-too-distant future,&quot; Mr. Meisler said.
