But U.S. officials are warning the Japanese that more progressmust be made on the issue or the possibility of sanctions could beraised again.   In announcing the decision, U.S. Trade Representative CarlaHills said Wednesday she had determined that Japan had made``significant progress'' in allowing U.S. companies to compete forconstruction jobs.   ``Firm and measured negotiations have produced results and wewelcome Japan's commitment to improve access to its constructionmarket,'' she said.   Separately, U.S. officials in Tokyo said today that a group ofJapanese construction firms has agreed to pay the U.S. government$32.6 million to settle a dispute over alleged bid-rigging ofprojects at the U.S. Navy base at Yokosuka, southwest of Tokyo.   Representatives from seven Japanese construction firms andAmerican officials signed the Memorandum of Intent on behalf of 99Japanese firms, the Justice Department said in a statement.   The U.S. government alleges 140 Japanese construction andrelated firms were involved in the bid-rigging and said the JusticeDepartment would continue to seek damages from the 41 not coveredby the memorandum.   Hills could have recommended sanctions that would haveeffectively doubled the cost of some Japanese imports to the UnitedStates.   She said the United States and Japan will continue negotiatingon the construction issue in an effort to remove furtherimpediments to American companies, and she set a May deadline forconcluding the next round of talks.   She said the decision not to retaliate was made because theJapanese have agreed to make greater efforts to discourage biddingcollusion between Japanese companies.   She also cited commitments by the Japanese to provide moreinformation to assist potential bidders and to allow opencompetition on the architectural design phase of five upcomingmajor airport renovation projects in the country.   While sanctions could still be imposed if Japan does not gofurther in opening its markets, Hills refused to say what actionsshe might take then.   ``I don't threaten anyone,'' she said. ``I sit down tonegotiate.''   U.S. construction, engineering and architecture companies havelong complained about barriers the Japanese have erected that keptthem from obtaining contracts.   Expansion of trade in services, where the United States is stillconsidered to have the lead, is considered by many to be the besthope America has of reducing its huge trade deficit, which is stillrunning at an annual rate of $100 billion, with Japan accountingfor about half of that amount.   Hills said construction was an area in which ``we can supply abetter product at a lower price.''   The review of Japanese construction practices was mandated byCongress in the 1988 trade law, which gave the administration oneyear to review the issue and decide whether to retaliate.   The administration is conducting several other negotiations withJapan, all aimed at reducing the huge trade imbalance between thetwo countries.   On another matter, Hills said she was optimistic that the UnitedStates would achieve many of its objectives in worldwide tradetalks being held with 97 other nations under the auspices of theGeneral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.   Known as the Uruguay Round, the trade talks are scheduled toconclude at the end of 1990.   Hills told reporters during a briefing that she hoped to reachagreement on some less contentious aspects of the talks by nextsummer, clearing the way for debate in the final months over suchsensitive issues as the U.S. demand for scrapping costly farmsubsidies.</TEXT></DOC>
