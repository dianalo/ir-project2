Such systemsare increasingly used in Karaganda mines, where they may cause a hazardof spontaneous coal combustion. Observations were made in a Karagandamine in a district with a 100 m longwall face, seam thickness 1.5 m,mined by a KM-87 powered complex. In 172 days the face advanced 310 mand the air flow rate from the assembly chamber into the outbye air fellfrom 265 to 48 m{sup 3}/min, while the proportion of methane by volumerose from 0.85 to 5.6%. A final equation is arrived at which may be usedto calculate the leaks of air through the isolating stoppings after theassembly chamber. Leaks of 0.1-0.9 m{sup 3}/(min x m{sup 2}) are knownto present a fire hazard. Putting this range of values into the equationwill give a range of times after which a fire hazard arises.</TEXT></DOC>
