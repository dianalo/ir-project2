Gets Contract For FAA Weather CentersandM;The Federal Aviation Administration recently awarded a $12.8 million contractto Harris Corp., Melbourne, Fla., to design, develop and install the WeatherMessage Switching Center Replacement (WMSCR) system.andM;The system will collect and process information from weather stations fordistribution to users within the National Airspace System.andP;  It also willcollect aircraft and navigation communications status reports such as closedair lane notices and temporary navigation aids.andM;&quot;The Weather Message Switching Center Replacement program is an importantelement of the National Airspace System plan for modernizing and improvingair traffic control, air safety and airway facilities services through theyear 2000,&quot; said Cas Mendez-Vigo, Harris director of advanced programs.andM;When the system is completed in about three years, he said, two identicalweather processing facilities in Salt Lake City and Atlanta will replace thepresent center in Kansas City, Mo.andM;The two centers will support all current weather processing functionsperformed by the present center, Mendez-Vigo said.andP;  They also will providestorage and distribution of a the notices to airmen, as well as provide agraphic data distribution capability.andM;&quot;Each node will cover one half of the United States, with backup capabilitiesin the event the other node fails to operate,&quot; he said.andM;&quot;If WMSCR doesn't work, planes can't fly,&quot; said Frank J. Lovaglio, vicepresident of business development for Harris' Government Information SystemsDivision.andM;The two sites will provide a redundancy not available in the current system,he said, and will increase operational availability.andP;  &quot;If one node fails, thesurviving node will assure complete system operation,&quot; he said.andM;The system also is expected to reduce maintenance and operational coststhrough the National Airspace Data Interchange Network packet-switch network.andM;The Harris design for WMSCR uses commercially available hardware includingDigital Equipment Corp.'s VAX 8350 super-minicomputers with programmablefront-end processors from Simpact Associates Inc., San Diego.andM;Software adapted from the Unified Message Switch provided by Global WeatherDynamics handles the remainder of the communications, he said.andM;The two nodes will be linked with the National Weather Service WMSCR atLeesburg, Va.andM;The WMSCR nodes will communicate over a 56K internodal link and X.25 PVCprotocols.andM;&quot;This link provides a suite of messages for input coordination, outputcoordination, dynamic and adaptive database replenishment and statuscoordination,&quot; he said.andM;The Leesburg interface device will connect the National Weather Servicetelecommunications gateway at Suitland, Md., and the two WMSCR nodes.andP;  Thisdevice, he said, will communicate with all three interfaces using full-duplexX.25 PVC services operating at up to 64K.andM;Alphanumeric data from the gateway will be replicated to both WMSCR nodes, hesaid, with graphics data from the National Weather Service to the WMSCR nodesrouted directly to each node over dedicated communication links.andM;Each WMSCR node has been configured with three Digital VAX 8350 processors ina cluster configuration, Mendez-Vigo said.andP;  Two processors handle theoperational load while the third serves as backup, network simulator andsoftware development test bed.andM;The VAX cluster arrangement also provides automated failure detection andquick switch-over capability.andM;The external interfaces are patterned after the International StandardsOrganization seven-layer model, Mendez-Vigo said, using commercial hardwareand software.andP;  The external communications channels are provided by fiveSimpact front-end communication processors operating at programmable rates upto 64K.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
