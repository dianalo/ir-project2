(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A mother collapsed on the witness standand had to be carried from the courtroom today after testifying indefense of her son, who is charged with fatally plunging a toddlerheadfirst into a toilet.   Mary Coe's collapse came after she had completed directquestioning in Thomas Coe's first-degree murder and aggravatedchild abuse trial in the death of his 2-year-old stepson, BradleyMcGee.   But as cross-examination was to begin, she asked for paramedicsto be standing by because she was not feeling well.   She soon collapsed and the proceedings were stopped. Paramedicstreated her at the Lee County Justice Center before she was carriedout on a stretcher. Her condition was not immediately known.   At the time, the judge was listening to her testimony with thejurors out of the room.   Coe, 23, is charged with murder and aggravated child abuse inthe death of Bradley one year ago this week. Prosecutors areseeking the death penalty.   Coe has admitted dunking the boy headfirst into the toilet,saying it was punishment for soiling his pants. The toddler diedthe next day of head injures.   Defense attorneys argue that he should be convicted of a lessercrime because it was a one-time form of punishment and there wasnever any intent to harm the child.   Bradley's death came two months after social workers recommendedto a judge that he be returned from foster care to his mother,Sheryl Coe, and stepfather. The death lead to a change in statepolicy toward foster care and charges against several child welfareworkers, most of whom were acquitted.   Mrs. Coe, 21, pleaded no contest to second-degree murder andaggravated child abuse and is serving a 30-year term.</TEXT></DOC>
