But while the East African nation often is singled out as aneconomic example for the rest of impoverished Africa, some Westernobservers have become increasingly concerned about its human rightsrecord under the authoritarian rule of President Daniel arap Moi.   Moi has ruled Kenya for 10 years under the slogan of ``Nyayo,'' aSwahili word meaning footsteps. Banners and signs praising thepresident and carrying the slogan adorn buildings and roadsthroughout the country.   The footsteps to be followed were originally those of JomoKenyatta, a leader of the struggle against British rule who becamethe country's first president in 1964, a year after independence. Heheld the post until his death in 1978.   Today, however, the footsteps to be followed are clearly Moi's.   Moi is firmly anti-communist, has no apparent affinity forAfrica's military rulers and follows generally conservative economicpolicies _ all of which has won him favor in Washington. But hisstyle of governing is iron-fisted and his word is law.   Disssent is little tolerated. Opposition political parties arebanned by law, and the parliament routinely endorses governmentinitiatives with little or no debate.   The government owns the country's only radio and televisionstations and one of the three leading newspapers in Nairobi. Thereis no official censorship, but even independent newspapers dare notattack Moi's policies.   Virtually the only internal criticism of the government thesedays comes from some clergymen and attorneys. Even this is generallycouched in terms gentle enough not to anger the president.   Parliament this year adopted a constitutional amendment thatgives Moi the right to dismiss judges, a move some lawyerscriticized as eroding the court's independence. Another amendmentempowering police to hold suspects in capital crimes for up to 14days without charge also drew criticism.   About 100 people are serving prison terms after being convictedof having links with three clandestine organizations purportedlyplotting to overthrow Moi's government. Many of those convictionswere based on what critics called tainted confessions.   It is the continuing crackdown against dissidents, which beganabout three years ago, that has brought the strongest condemnationfrom civil rights groups and individuals outside Kenya.   The London-based Amnesty International human rights group hasaccused Moi's government of subjecting dissidents to torture, phonytrials and disappearances for ``prolonged periods in unacknowledgedand unlawful custody.''   Sen. Edward F. Kennedy last month urged the Kenyan government to``pull back from darkness of torture and represession and return tothe bright sunlight of freedom, tolerance and the rule of law.   ``Will Kenya go forward with its campaign of intimidation andfear?'' asked the Democrat from Massachusets.   The words were perhaps the harshest criticism of Moi's policiesyet voiced in the United States. They came at a Washington ceremonyin which the 1988 Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights Award was bestowedin absentia on a Kenyan lawyer barred from leaving his country.   Moi has called Amnesty International an ``agent of imperialists''but has so far ignored Kennedy's remarks. The government hasconsistently denied torture allegations, and several prison guardsand police officers have been charged in recent months withmistreating civilians.   The 64-year-old Moi, who seems to enjoy widespread popularityamong his people, makes no apologies for the crackdown againstdissidents.   ``My responsibility is to defend a majority of peace-lovingKenyans,'' he has said repeatedly.   With dissent stifled, Kenya enjoys a political stability littleknown in many parts of a continent torn by civil wars and tribalconflicts. And while massive poverty still exists in large parts ofthe country, its economy is nevertheless the envy of many of itsneighbors.   Tourists, lured by Kenya's Indian Ocean beaches and theelephants, lions, rhinos and other exotic animals that roam itsnational parks, pumped nearly $350 million into the economy lastyear. That ranked second only to agriculture, which not only fed thenation's burgeoning population but exported nearly half a billiondollars worth of coffee, tea and other commodities.   But warning flags are flying for the economy.   Slightly smaller than the state of Texas, Kenya has a populationof 22 million that is growing at a rate of 3.8 percent a year, oneof the highest in the world.   By the turn of the century, the population is forecast to be 35million, possibly outstripping the country's ability to feed itself.   Only 20 percent of Kenya's mostly arid land is tillable, and thatportion already is severely overcrowded.</TEXT></DOC>
