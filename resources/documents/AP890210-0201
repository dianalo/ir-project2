Bush, on his first foreign trip as president, said no specifictimetable was set in talks with Canadian Prime Minister BrianMulroney on when acid rain-causing emissions from U.S. plants wouldbe curbed.   But, he said he was committed to ``move as fast as possible'' onthe new initiatives he outlined Thursday in his speech to Congress.   ``I have an obligation to move forward with specifics,'' Bushsaid in an outdoor news conference with Mulroney after a ``workinglunch'' at the prime minister's residence.   Later, aboard Air Force One en route to Maine, Bush said that hefelt that Mulroney, in their talks, ``was reasonablywell-satisfied'' with the U.S. statements about acid rain.   ``I mean, they probably are a little ahead of us in terms ofwhere they wish we were right now in terms of bilateralnegotiations. Generally speaking, there was no tension over that.... It was very good in that sense,'' Bush added.   In Ottawa, Mulroney praised Bush's initiative on fighting acidrain _ including a promise to spend $2.5 billion toward solving theproblem, vowing to propose legislation setting new limits onsmokestack emissions, and negotiating an agreement with Canada onspecific acid rain levels.   ``This is real progress,'' Mulroney said. ``And while I supposeI, like a lot of people, would like it done tomorrow in this area, Iknow it's not going to happen. But this represents some verymeasurable progress.''   Both the prime minister and the new president proclaimedrelations between the two nations good and getting better.   Bush said he selected Canada for his first presidential tripoutside U.S. borders to ``symbolize the importance that we place onthe relationship with Canada. We're each other's largest tradingpartners. We are friends. We share a long peaceful border and wehave many common interests.''   Standing with snow on the ground and U.S. and Canadian flagssnapping in the breeze, Bush asserted: ``We will keep in touch. Andeach of us is pledged to see that this strong relationship becomeseven stronger.''   On another subject, Bush dismissed the importance of Friday'sreport from the Labor Department that wholesale prices in Januarysurged a full percentage point.   He said the Producer Price Index ``jumps around some. I am notoverly concerned about inflation in the United States.'' But, headded, he did not like the figures.   ``The economy is growing and I think that's good,'' Bush said,calling Friday's report ``a blip on an otherwise calm radar screen.''   Bush said he and Mulroney discussed various topics includingtrade and East-West relations.   He said he valued Mulroney's advice on dealings with SovietPresident Mikhail S. Gorbachev.   Mulroney called the meeting ``very encouraging.''   He fielded questions in both English and French. And at one pointBush tried to do likewise, but his high-school French didn't takehim very far.   Would he take a question in French? ``Mais oui,'' (but yes), Bushsaid.   However, when the question was shouted out, Bush said, ``je necomprends pas,'' (I don't understand).   Bush's five-hour visit consisted of three events: a two-hourmeeting with Mulroney at ``7 Rideau Gate,'' the government's guesthouse; a two-hour ``working lunch''in the prime minister'sresidence, and a shorter tea at the conclusion of the day.   Earlier, Mulroney said, ``we're here to do a little work,'' astalk with Bush and Secretary of State James A. Baker III began.   Baker said later that Bush's promise on moving to curb acid rainrepresents a major shift in U.S. additude on the issue, and thatMulroney recognized this.   However, he said discussing a specific timetable at this pointwould be premature, given regional political feelings on the issueof cleanup costs in the United States.   Major questions still unanswered, Baker told a briefing, are``what is the target for reductions and who is going to pay theprice?''   Baker said Bush and Mulroney also discussed the president'sproposal for a one-year freeze on U.S. defense spending at the levelof inflation, as well as Central America and U.S.-Soviet relations.   He called Friday's session ``primarily an agenda-settingmeeting.''   Bush, in address to Congress on Thursday night, made a specialpitch for fighting acid rain, and talked about his $1.16 trillionfiscal 1990 budget that seeks to curb Pentagon spending whileproviding more for domestic programs.   This included a commitment to spend $2.5 billion in agovernment-industry project to find ways to reduce emissions thatcause acid rain.   Bush also told Congress he would propose legislation for newfederal emission curbs, saying ``the time for study alone haspassed, and the time for action is now.''   The pollution is caused when contaminants from coal-burning powerplants and other industrial plants are carried in the wind and mixwith the rain. The rainfall kills some wildlife and damages lakes,forests and structures.   As the two leaders had lunch, about three dozen demonstratorsstood outside in the snow, some carrying anti-American signs andprotesting the testing of U.S. warplanes in Canadian skies. ``GeorgeBush, enemy of the peoples of the world,'' one demonstrator yelled.   Earlier, Bush's press secretary, Marlin Fitzwater, said thepresident felt his address to Congress had been well-received.   ``He was very pleased by the general reaction to it,'' includingthe Democratic response, which Bush ``felt was very constructive,''Fitzwater said. Fitzwater said Democrats appeared receptive toBush's proposal for early budget negotiations.   ``The main thing is to sit down and start talking and see whereit goes,'' Fitzwater said.   After leaving Canada, Bush planned to spend the weekend at hisfamily's seacoast retreat at Kennebunkport, Maine. No public eventswere scheduled.   On Monday, he makes a speech in Manchester, N.H., that aides saidwould focus on his new budget.</TEXT></DOC>
