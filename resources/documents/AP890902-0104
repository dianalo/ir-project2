(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Ocie Mills and his son Carey are strictlyminor leaguers when it comes to polluting the nation's waterways.   But they are near the top of the list in stubbornness, and that'swhy they are in prison while much bigger polluters are not, says alawyer for the Army Corps of Engineers.   ``Most usually work it out short of trial'' by agreeing to payfines and repairing environmental damage, said Mike Rossiter in arecent telephone interview from the Corps' district headquarters inJacksonville. ``They wanted their day in court and they got it.''   Ocie Mills, a 55-year-old retired contractor, and his 31-year-oldson are serving 21-month sentences in the federal prison camp atSaufley Field, a Navy installation outside this Florida Panhandlecity.   The father and son are two of only five federal prisoners servingtime for polluting, according to the U.S. Bureau of Prisons. Theyalso are the first polluters convicted under a new law that takessentencing discretion away from judges.   A jury last January convicted them of violating environmental lawby dumping several truckloads of fill on wetlands in neighboringSanta Rosa County. They also were convicted of illegally dredging acanal on the property, two small lots on which they had planned tobuild a house for Carey.   The Millses insist the fill was dumped on uplands rather thanwetlands, that they were only cleaning out an existing drainageditch rather than dredging, that they didn't need Corps permissionto do either. In any case, they said, they caused no pollution.   ``We believe there are some politics in it,'' said the elderMills, who ran unsuccessfully for the Florida House last year andhas frequently been at loggerheads with state and federalauthorties. But he admits he cannot prove various conspiracytheories he espouses to explain his plight.   He believes government is butting in where it doesn't belong bytrying to tell people what they can and cannot do with theirproperty.   Their case has become a cause celebre among friends and theright-wing John Birch Society, of which they are members. Theirsupporters have written numerous letters to the editors ofnewspapers and raised about $3,000 for legal fees.   But Rossiter makes no apology, saying the Millses failed to takeadvantage of opportunities to settle the case, daring authorities totake them to court.   ``We consider all violations, no matter how small violations,''he said. ``They were blatant violators, flagrant violators.''   If officials looked the other way, Rossiter said, neighbors woulddo the same thing, eventually destroying wetlands that filterpollutants from the water and serve as a nursery for marine life.   The Millses could be free men and they would have been allowed tobuild the house on stilts to protect the wetlands if only they hadcooperated, he said.   DER has filed suit against the Millses to force them to restorethe property. The pair have countersued, accusing the agency ofconspiracy. A state judge has heard the case but not yet ruled.   The Millses are appealing the criminal convictions.</TEXT></DOC>
