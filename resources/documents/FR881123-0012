The second correction amends 49 CFR 390.5 by removing a definitionthat is not needed.The third correction amends 49 CFR 390.5 by revising the definition ``exemptintracity zone'' to make it comport with the FHWA's original intent. Thefourth correction amends 49 CFR 390.27 to correctly state the addressesof FHWA's regional motor carrier safety offices. The fifth correction amends49 CFR 387.41 so that the provisions of the section will be clearly understoodand the rule will correctly reflect a reorganization within the agency.The sixth correction amends 49 CFR 390.21 so that the provisions of thesection are consistent. The seventh correction redesignates a paragraphin 49 CFR 395.2 and amends 49 CFR 395.13 so that the referral to anothersection is correct.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>EFFECTIVE DATE: </T2>November 15, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2>Mr. Thomas P.

The farm driverexemptions found in andSection; 391.2 and andSection; 391.67 have been in effectsince December 22, 1971, and were issued to meet specific, unique transportationneeds of the country's farm community. We have received no evidence thatthose needs have changed and the FHWA received no comments regarding theremoval of andSection; 391.2(c). In view of the fact that the removal ofandSection; 391.2(c) in the final rule that was published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4> on Thursday, May 19, 1988 (53 FR 18042) wasinadvertent, the FHWA is reinstating andSection; 391.2(c).The second technical amendment made today corrects andSection; 390.27, Locationsof regional motor carrier safety offices, to reflect several recent addresschanges which were not incorporated in the final rule that was publishedin the <T4>Federal Register </T4> on Thursday, May 19, 1988 (53 FR 18042).Section 390.5, Definitions, as published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4> on May 19, 1988 (53 FR 18054), contained a definitionof ``taxicab.'' Since vehicles having a gross vehicle weight rating (GVWR)of 10,000 pounds or less or vehicles designed to transport less than 15passengers, including the driver, are not subject to the FMCSRs, the definitionof ``taxicab'' is not needed and is, therefore, being removed.The definition of ``exempt intracity zone'' also published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4> on May 19, 1988 (53 FR 18054) is amended tomake it comport with the FHWA's original intent. In describing exempt intracityzones, the FHWA intended to refer to the ICC definition of a ``commercialzone'' simply for purposes of delineating the geographic area within whicha driver or vehicle otherwise subject to the agency's safety regulationswould be exempt from those requirements. It was not the FHWA's intent tolimit the exemption to those drivers who were ``not under a common control,management, or arrangement for a continuous carriage or shipment.'' <T3>See</T3> 49 CFR 1048.101 (republished as section 44 of Appendix F toSubchapter B, 53 FR 18042, 18069 (1988)). In fact, drivers under such commoncontrol, management, or arrangement were subject to a similar ICC exemptionwhen operating in ``terminal areas.'' 49 U.S.C. 10523. The amendment tothe definition of ``exempt intracity zone'' is intended to make clear thatit applies to drivers in these geographic locations regardless of whetherthe driver is under a common control, management, or arrangement for acontinuous carriage or shipment.The financial responsibility requirements for motor carriers was publishedin the <T4>Federal Register </T4> on Monday, November 21, 1983 (48 FR 52653).Section 387.41, Violation and penalty, was originally published with atypographical error that changed the intended meaning of the section. Theword ``capability'' was used when the proper word for the appropriate sentenceshould have been ``culpability.'' This error was discovered recently andis not being corrected by this technical amendent. This technical correctionalso reflects a reorganization within the agency.Paragraph (b)(4) of andSection; 390.21, Marking of motor vehicles, refersto paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2), but should also have referred to (b)(3)for completeness (pertaining to information which must be marked on a motorvehicle). The omission of (b)(3) from this paragraph was inadvertent, andparagraph (b)(4) is being revised to include the reference to paragraph(b)(3).A final rule concerning automatic on-board recording devices was publishedin the <T4>Federal Register </T4> on Monday, September 30, 1988 (53 FR 39666).This rule included a definition of ``automatic on-board recording device,''but it incorrectly designated this definition as paragraph (k). That paragraphshould have been designated as paragraph (i) to conform to changes madeon May 19, 1988. <T3>See </T3>53 FR 18958. Also, andSection; 395.13(b)(2) referred incorrectlyto the provisions of ``andSection; 395.13.'' That typographical error isbeing corrected by changing the referral to ``andSection; 395.15.''Finally, the agency has received several calls questioning the discussionconcerning rescission of the intracity zone exemption that begins on page18046 of the May 19, 1988, <T4>Federal Register.</T4> The discussion heading incorrectly appears as``Exempt Intercity Operation Drivers.'' The heading should have read ``ExemptIntracity Operation Drivers.'' Two additional references to ``intercityzones'' were incorrectly made in the body of the discussion. These weretypographical errors made during printing preparation. The entire discussionaddresses the ``intracity zone exemption'' and should be interpreted thatway.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 49 CFR Parts 387, 390, and 391</ITAG>Highway safety, Highways and roads, Financial responsibility, Motor carriers,Motor vehicle safety, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements, Motor vehiclesafety.In view of the above, the FHWA is amending 49 CFR Parts 387, 390, 391,and 395 as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 387_[AMENDED]</ITAG>1.
