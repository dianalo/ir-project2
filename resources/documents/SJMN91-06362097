If the engine compression and the ignition system test OK,ask the dealer to check the operation of the idle speed solenoid. When the airconditioner is on, the idle speed should increase to eliminate the roughidle.;   Q There are sticking valves on my '89 Toyota. The car had been instorage. Can they be freed for less than the $800 that the dealer wouldcharge?;   k,4 -- No name, Jacksonville, Fla.; A A can of rustremover/lubricant is needed. Remove the valve covers and spark plugs. Fog thecombustion chamber, tap the valves down slowly after lubricating the stemsthrough the springs. Continue to gently tap the valves up and down until theymove freely. Do not drive the valves down hard or the head will have to beremoved, disassembled and serviced. When the car is running smoothly, changethe oil and filter.;   Q What causes our old VW to shimmy so hard at 35 to 40mph? The shimmy stops when we brake and slow the car.;   F.B.A., Raleigh,N.C.; A There was a shimmy dampening absorber attached to the old Volkswagenpitman or idler arms. It should be replaced and the toe-in checked. I presumeyou have had the tires and wheels balanced and the caster, camber and toe-inset. If not, do that also.;   Q The brakes on my '88 Nissan Sentra have beenrelined, but there is still bad brake noise. Three brake shops say the brakeswork fine. Is there any cure for this noise?;   S.V.P., Winter Park, Fla.; A Iremember seeing a Nissan kit to install noise canceling springs on the reardrums. You might ask your Nissan Service Manager about this kit. I read it inNissan Tech News. If the worst noise comes from the front brakes, you mighttry cross-hatching the rotor discs. This will help lower the noise, but italso reduces pad life. There is no cure for ending noise on non-asbestosbrakes. All brake engineers are trying to find a solution.;    Q What causesheavy smoke and oil consumption in my 1987 Audi Turbo Diesel? The cost of oilis breaking me!;   W.C.R., DeLand, Fla.; A Have a compression test performedto see if rings are badly worn or sticking. Check the valve seals. If theproblem is the turbo shaft seal, the smoke will be heavy and blue-tinted.;   QHow long does an electric fuel pump last?;   K.J.S., Miami; A It might last50,000 miles. Electrical pumps seem to fail quicker than the older, mechanicalunits.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Bill Gordon column  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   911227  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Friday  </DAY><MONTH>  December  </MONTH><PG.COL>  2H  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  483  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Friday, December 27, 199100362097,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
