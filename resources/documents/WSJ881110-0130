Aldridge plans to resign next month to become president of a soon-to-be formed McDonnell Douglas Corp. unit.    Secretary Aldridge, who ushered the Air Force through a crisis in its space program, will head up McDonnell Douglas Electronic Systems Inc., a new unit to be based in the Washington, D.C., area. Air Force Undersecretary James McGovern will serve as the acting secretary until President-elect George Bush names a successor to Mr. Aldridge next year.    Secretary Aldridge rose to the top Air Force post in June 1986, after serving for five years as undersecretary. The January 1986 explosion of the space shuttle Challenger temporarily brought the shuttle program to a halt, and he was the chief architect of a program to lessen the military's dependence on the manned spacecraft. He set in motion a multibillion-dollar procurement of a fleet of various vehicles capable of launching the Pentagon's spy satellites and other space assets.    Mr. Aldridge was a long-time critic of the military's growing dependence on the space shuttle. But it was the shuttle explosion and the failure of two Air Force Titan rockets that forced the Defense Department to expand and diversify its fleet of launch vehicles.    In another move to ensure that the military could have continued access to space, Mr. Aldridge pushed a program to design satellites so they could be carried by either the shuttle or by throwaway rockets the Air Force had ordered.    Perhaps the most ambitious of Mr. Aldridge's undertakings at the Air Force -- a program to develop a high-technology family of space-launch vehicles lumped together as the &quot;advanced launch system&quot; -- is still in limbo. The program, which would include development of a heavy launch rocket, is viewed as a requirement for any deployment of space-based, anti-missile weapons under the Star Wars program. Because of its link to the controversial strategic defense project, the advance launch system has been snarled in debates over whether to field space weapons.    The new McDonnell unit Mr. Aldridge will head will assume several existing activities at the large aerospace company. Among these is the company's classified work on spy satellites, its work on military command, control and communications systems, and a number of electronics programs. </TEXT></DOC>
