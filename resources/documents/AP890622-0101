South Africa, Botswana and Zimbabwe, which must cull theirelephants to keep the population under control, say such a ban coulddrive up the price of illegal ivory and doesn't take into accountlegal ivory exports that generate income for conservation programs.   ``Our basic position is that we do not support a total ban on theivory trade worldwide,'' said Bosman Olivier, a spokesman for theDepartment of Environmental Affairs.   Olivier said South Africa wanted to make its position known butdoes not plan to campaign in support of ivory trade.   ``In South Africa we have a very healthy elephant population thatmust be culled or it will simply destroy its own environment,'' hesaid. ``The selling of the ivory in a legal manner makes goodsense.''   South Africa earns $2 million annually from the sale of elephanttusks at the culling program in Kruger National Park, Olivier said.The money is spent on animal research and maintaining the park, headded.   Dick Pitman, chairman of the Zimbabwean conservation group theZambezi Society, said there is a question whether bans ``really workor whether they merely raise prices and drive trade underground.''   Soaring ivory prices in the last decade have fueled a killingspree that has cut Africa's elephant population from an estimated1.5 million in the 1970s to less than 700,000 today, experts say. Anaverage tusk weighs 11 pounds and can fetch $109 a pound on theinternational market.   This month, the United States, Canada, the 12-nation EuropeanEconomic Community, Switzerland and Canada have imposed bans onivory imports that make elephant poaching profitable. The EEC, Japanand the United States consume up to 75 percent of the ivory in worldmarkets.   The 102-member Convention In Trade Of Endangered Species willconsider such a ban in an October meeting in Geneva.   Kenya, one country that supports a total ban on the trade, todayannounced plans to destroy 12 tons of ivory the government hasseized from poachers, and it urged other nations to do the same.President Daniel arap Moi gave no specific date for the incineration.</TEXT></DOC>
