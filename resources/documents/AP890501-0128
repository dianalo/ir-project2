There was no hint of compromise in the statement read byspokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler at the State Department. She denied,however, that U.S. officials were irritated with Kohl for trying todelay the modernization of the Lance missiles and artillery and fordemanding U.S. negotiations with the Soviet Union to reduce thenuclear arsenal.   ``Secretary (James A.) Baker is not upset,'' the U.S. officialsaid.   The rift was not healed during a weekend meeting in West Germanybetween Kohl and British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, anardent proponent of extending the range of the missiles as a way ofdeterring Soviet attack.   ``We, of course, share the view of the United Kingdom that itwould be a mistake to engage in negotiations on SNF (Short-rangeNuclear Forces),'' Ms. Tutwiler said. ``We also share the UnitedKingdom view that we need to maintain an up-to-date land-basednuclear deterrent in Europe.''   She continued: ``We have a difference of opinion with othermembers of the (North Atlantic Treaty Organization) alliance and wewill be seeking to resolve the issue...''   The statement's reference to ground-based missiles appeared torule out a compromise under which the Lances in West German mightbe scaled back or withdrawn and their place in NATO strategy takenby air-launched cruise missiles.   It also suggested the West Germans have some support within NATO.   The dispute is causing strains in the alliance and could put adamper on President Bush's summit meeting in Brussels May 29-30with the leaders of the 15 other NATO countries.   Baker is due in Brussels on May 12 for previously scheduledtalks with NATO officials and will discuss the tactical nuclearissue with Western foreign ministers.   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater, asked about theimpasse, said, ``our position remains that keeping the peacerequires a strong NATO alliance, and a policy of flexible response.We believe the vast Soviet superiority and Warsaw Pact conventionalforces must be reduced before we can discuss reductions in shortrange nuclear weapons.''   ``The West German position demonstrates the special strengththat NATO has,'' Fitzwater said. ``Our allies can debate quitevigorously these issues, yet maintain the basic strength of ourunity.''   But, he continued, ``we believe very strongly in our position;we believe very strongly that flexible response is essential to thepeace of Europe.''   The New York Times quoted unnamed Bush administration officialson Sunday as saying the Kohl government was threatening NATO'sunity by pressing for speeding negotiations with the Soviets on themissiles and artillery. The newspaper said the officials had grownincreasingly irritated with Kohl for trying to line up otherEuropean nations against the United States.   Behind the scenes the two sides are jockeying for support.   The Associated Press disclosed last week that all U.S.ambassadors in NATO capitals were instructed to outline the U.S.position to the host governments to try to win them over. WestGermany is using the same approach.</TEXT></DOC>
