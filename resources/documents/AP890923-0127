The bill was approved by Congress amid growing nationalattention for the case. It applies retroactively to Morgan, who wasjailed for failing to produce her 7-year-old daughter, Hilary, forcourt-ordered visits with the girl's father, Dr. Eric Foretich.   Morgan, a prominent plastic surgeon, hid her daughter and wentto jail after alleging that Foretich had sexually abused the girl.Foretich has repeatedly denied those charges and at one pointoffered a $5,000 reward for information that would help find thegirl.   The child's whereabouts, however, remain secret.   Hours after Bush signed the bill, Morgan's attorney, Adrian Roe,filed the papers with the District of Columbia Court of Appealsseeking her release.   Court Clerk Richard Hoffman then began telephoning each of thenine judges on the panel in hopes that one could come to thecourthouse and review the request. Despite the new law, Morgancannot be freed without a judge's order.   ``I'm doing my best to transmit it to the judges, and that's allI can do,'' Hoffman said.   Roe said he was ``hopeful the court will act promptly, but wehave no guarantees,'' Roe said.   The bill takes advantage of Congress' authority to reviewdistrict laws and among other things sets a 12-month cap for civilcontempt child-custody jailings. It also contains a so-calledsunset provision that means it automatically goes off the books in18 months.   As clamor over the case grew, the House and Senate acceleratedaction on the bill. A late-working Senate approved the measure onFriday morning, shortly after midnight, and sent it to thepresident's desk.   Rep. Frank Wolf, R-Va., the House sponsor, and Utah RepublicanOrrin Hatch, who pushed the measure in the Senate, both have saidthey were motivated by concern for Morgan's dilemma.   Foretich and his attorney, Elaine Mittleman, have complainedthat the bill does not require Morgan to produce Hilary.   ``President Bush has been badly served by his advisors,''Mittleman said in a telephone interview Saturday. ``President Bushobviously loves children, but this bill does nothing to insure thatHilary will ever see her father again.''   As the bill raced through the Congress and to the president, theentire appeals court was reviewing an August decision by athree-judge appeals panel that Morgan should go free.   In that earlier decision, the judges had ruled that Morganshould be released because the coercive basis for her jailing hadbecome unconstitutionally punitive.</TEXT></DOC>
