The latest move is the second part of a two-step action authorized by the central bank's policy committee at its meeting earlier this month. The Fed's move is likely to result in lower rates on bank loans and other consumer interest rates.    The Fed's action became apparent when, for the second day in a row, the central bank took no action to prevent a decline in the key federal funds interest rate. The move is expected to reduce the funds rate to about 9%, from its recent level of 9 1/4%. That, in turn, could encourage banks to reduce their prime lending rate from the current 10 1/2% to 11% range.    Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan made it clear in recent congressional testimony that the Fed is worried about the risk that the economy may be falling into recession. Fed Gov. Martha Seger underscored that risk in an interview yesterday.    &quot;I see weakness in two industries -- housing and autos -- that's even greater than I expected,&quot; Ms. Seger said. &quot;And I think that's going to slosh over into other areas of the economy.&quot;    Most Fed officials are less pessimistic than Ms. Seger, and say they think a downturn is unlikely. But they say they believe the risks of recession have increased, and favor a cautious easing of the Fed's credit stance. &quot;I think the balance has shifted over the last two to three months to a greater risk of recession,&quot; said Roger Guffey, president of the Kansas City Federal Reserve Bank in an interview earlier this week. &quot;But that has to be taken in context. Before . . . the last couple of months, inflation was really the risk.&quot;    The fed funds rate, which in recent years has been the Fed's principal policy target, is the rate banks charge on loans to each other. The Fed can largely determine that rate by buying or selling government securities to financial institutions.    The funds rate has dropped three-quarters of a percentage point since the Fed began easing credit in early June. The central bank has been reluctant to move more quickly, fearing that the economy's slowdown will prove to be temporary, and that inflation will begin to accelerate.    Bush administration officials have been urging a more rapid reduction in interest rates. But the Fed is likely to continue to move slowly and cautiously unless it sees new signs of a sharp slowdown.    Nevertheless, many analysts believe the Fed will eventually ease further. &quot;In all likelihood, there are further easing moves ahead&quot; because of &quot;the slowdown in economic growth and the moderation in inflation,&quot; said Rudolf Thunberg, economist at Ried, Thunberg andamp; Co., a Westport, Conn., investment research firm.    The Fed's policy committee, known as the Federal Open Market Committee, has been divided in recent months between several of the Fed governors in Washington, who favor an easier policy, and many of the district Fed presidents, who are reluctant to ease credit. The committee's next meeting is scheduled for Aug. 22.    Bankers have been waiting for the Fed to act before matching Chase Manhattan Bank's recent move to cut its prime lending rate to 10 1/2% from 11%. Some bankers said that if the federal funds rate remains around 9% or 9 1/8%, that would persuade them to lower their prime, or base, rates soon, perhaps as early as today.    The fed funds rate actually fell well below 9% at one point yesterday, the final day of a two-week period in which banks settle their reserve positions with the central bank. Settlement days often cause sharp technical movements.    &quot;It certainly looks as though the funds rate now is at 9% and, if that's the case, we'll see declines rather quickly&quot; in the prime rate to 10 1/2%, says Kathleen Cooper, chief economist at Security Pacific National Bank, Los Angeles. &quot;Banks have been waiting to see the funds rate move down&quot; before cutting the prime rate.    She also expects further rate declines. &quot;I think before the year is out, we'll see somewhat lower rates&quot; as the Fed moves &quot;to make sure that this soft landing stays a soft landing, rather than a hard landing,&quot; she said.    The prime rate commands widespread attention because it is used by banks as a benchmark to set rates on many types of consumer loans, such as home-equity loans. It is also used to set rates on loans to numerous small and medium-sized businesses.    ---   Tom Herman in New York contributed to this article. </TEXT></DOC>
