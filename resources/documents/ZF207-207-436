(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>By Jane MorrisseyandM;Hospital-supply giant Baxter Healthcare Corp. is playing hardball withsoftware vendors vying for its multimillion-dollar LAN database installationby demanding the vendors meet an unusually comprehensive list ofrequirements.andM;Baxter's database demands are among the most extensive and detailed developedfor PC LANs to date, according to developers competing for the Baxterbusiness.andM;The exhaustive requirements provide a vivid example of the increasing use ofmainframe-style purchasing tactics by buyers to get what they want fromsoftware vendors, according to corporate buyers and industry analysts.andM;''[Baxter's approach] is reflective of what's going on inside largecorporations,'' said Rich Finkelstein, president of the Chicago-baseddatabase consulting firm Performance Computing Inc.andM;The quest to choose one companywide OS/2 LAN database-server standard for its170 geographically dispersed networks drove Baxter to define a detailedseries of key requirements.andM;Because the Structured Query Language (SQL) database server Baxter choosesmust be able to service mission-critical and transaction-processingapplications, the list mandates full suites of mainframe-classdatabase-management system features for the desktop, such as data-audit andrecovery mechanisms, advanced security and remote database-managementcapabilities.andM;The five-page list was sent to a dozen LAN database software firms inFebruary and generated formal responses from Gupta Technologies Inc.andO;(SQLBase), Ashton-Tate/Microsoft/Sybase (SQL Server), Oracle Corp. (LANServer) and IBM (OS/2 Extended Edition Database Manager).andP;  Although none ofthe vendors has committed to meeting all of the requirements, Baxterofficials said they were impressed with all four companies' responsiveness,and they're betting Baxter will be able to influence development direction.andM;''It's a question of vendor resources and priorities, and the leverage thatwe can bring to the planning process,'' said Mike Purcell, a Baxter engineerin McGaw Park, Ill., who drafted the requirements.andP;  ''If we can help thevendors with a good definition [of our needs], maybe it'll help us learn morerealistic [expectations].''andM;Rod Zimmerman, SQLBase product manager for Gupta in Menlo Park, Calif., saidhe was impressed with the Baxter document's conciseness and''state-of-the-art'' technical depth.andM;Lists such as Baxter's generally do not alter a vendor's major developmentplans, Zimmerman said.andP;  He conceded, however, that they do reinforce productdirection and guide development of secondary enhancements.andM;For requirements that present the developers with longer-term challenges,Baxter intends to determine whether the level of vendor commitment will meshwith its future needs.andP;  For such items as remote distributed databasemanagement, which Purcell views as a weakness in all of the products underconsideration, vendors must be willing to describe product direction undernon-disclosure pacts.andM;Not all LAN database decision-making at major corporations has been ascarefully orchestrated as Baxter's.andP;  Corporate experiences run the gamut fromexhaustive testing to flying by ''the seat of their pants,'' said oneconsultant to a major brokerage.andM;The consultant, who requested anonymity, lamented, ''I've been banging myhead against the wall to get [the firm] to realize they need criteria.'' Ashead of a pilot project to evaluate and implement a LAN database server, theconsultant chose SQL Server without any corporate guidelines.andP;  Althoughpleased with the architecture, the consultant must play it safe by keepingapplications easily portable in case better servers become available.andM;Baxter hopes to test vendor commitment once the hands-on evaluation is inmotion, Purcell added.andP;  Since the new architecture will be implemented closerto the user than ever before, using new and prerelease hardware and softwareplatforms, excellent support is essential.andM;''After all this, the hardest work has yet to begin,'' said Purcell.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
