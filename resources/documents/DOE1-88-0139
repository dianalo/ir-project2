Among the major gaps in social programsare: (1) the lack of consideration of wage levels under AT productiontransformations, (2) the failure to consider a wealth policy as wellas a wage policy, and (3) the problems of supporting state provisionof public goods and services under AT programs. To these gaps, and theirpolitical ramifications, must be added the political burdens of (1) attitudestowards redistributive policies, (2) the uncertainty that increased industrialgrowth necessarily has socially significant costs, and that AT will necessarilyhave socially significant benefits, and (3) the concomitant responsesof politically-active people towards such major uncertainties. Thesepolitical realities especially underlie current support for 'reindustrialization'rather than for AT-like programs in the United States. (orig./HSCH)</TEXT></DOC>
