Measurements ona series of glucagon/secretin hybrids indicated that replacement of Asp{sup9} in glucagon by Glu{sup 9}, found in secretin, was the important sequencedifference in the N terminus of the two hormones. Further deletion ofHis{sup 1} and introduction of a C-terminal amide resulted in des-His{sup1}-[Glu{sup 9}]glucagon amide, which had a 40% binding affinity relativeto that of native glucagon but caused no detectable adenylate cyclaseactivation in the rat liver membrane. This antagonist completely inhibitedthe effect of a concentration of glucagon that alone gave a full agonistresponse. It had an inhibition index of 12. The pA{sub 2} was 7.2. Anattempt was made to relate conformation with receptor binding. The peptideswere synthesized by solid-phase methods and purified to homogeneity byreverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography on C{sub 18}-silicacolumns.</TEXT></DOC>
