Police said 26 students forced their way past guards at a backgate of the Combined Central Government Building in downtown Seouland hurled at least 10 firebombs at the complex. Eight of theattackers barricaded themselves in a third-floor cafeteria beforethey were seized by police.   Nobody was injured in the attack in which windows were smashedand a police guard post and a waiting room blackened by flames andsmoke. Police said they arrested 18 attackers and that the othersfled.   The building, across the street from the U.S. Embassy, housesthe prime minister's office, the Foreign Ministry and other majorgovernment departments.   Small clashes also were reported today in the provincial citiesof Taeju and Kwangju as riot police firing volleys of tear gasdispersed students hurling rocks and firebombs. No injuries orarrests were immediately reported.   The attacks were mounted after riot police blocked thousands ofradical students on Friday from mounting a march to the NorthKorean border for talks on reuniting the divided Korean peninsula.Fighting began on Friday when police fired tear gas to drive backstudents who hurled firebombs and battled with rocks and clubs totry and break through to the border.   Police officials said today that more than 800 students werearrested in the clashes the day before. More than 100 police andstudents were injured in the street clashes, they said.   About 60,000 riot police were deployed to halt the march to theborder truce site of Panmunjom. Riot police remained on alert todayand troopers guarded key government buildings and U.S. diplomaticoffices.   Radical leaders at a rally today at Yonsei University in thewest of Seoul vowed to mount another march to the border on Aug.15, national independence day, and said they would not abandon thereunification drive.   ``Our struggle has ignited the mind of the people who wantreunficition of our land,'' one leader said in a speech.   About 2,000 students applauded the speakers and shouted slogans.But the students' mood was subdued and thousands of others who hadgathered at the campus for the march Friday left overnight.   Speakers continued to denounce the United States and demand thewithdrawal of the 42,000 U.S. troops based in South Korea under amutual defense pact.   ``Yankee go home'' and ``Reunification,'' students chanted.   Radicals claim the United States enforces partition of theKorean peninsula so it can rule the south as a virtual colony. Awave of violent anti-American protests has hit South Korea duringthe past month.   The radicals, who represent between 10 percent and 20 percent ofcollege students, have failed to attract popular support with theirreunification campaign. The main opposition parties urged radicalsto abandon the march, saying it lacked public support.   Most people in South Korea fear the totalitarian north isdetermined to conquer the south. North Korea invaded the south in1950 to start the Korean War and the two nations remain bitteropponents.   The North Korean government said its student delegates waitedFriday at Panmunjom for the South Korean students. It denounced theUnited States and the South Korean government, claiming they wantto block reunification.</TEXT></DOC>
