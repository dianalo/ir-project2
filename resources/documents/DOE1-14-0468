These factors led to great expectations ofhow fast its nuclear power program might expand. The U.S. recently implementeda controversial nuclear cooperation agreement with China, permittingU.S. companies to compete if this market reopens. The major concern overthe agreement was that in the past China apparently showed an alarmingdisregard for the dangers of nuclear proliferation. It is unlikely thatChina would use nuclear power equipment to further its nuclear weaponsprogram, but the effectiveness of the U.S. nonproliferation stance hasbeen in part dependent on other countries viewing our position as uncompromising.The vagueness of certain provisions in the agreement with China may haveweakened this stance. Another concern is that access to U.S. pressurizedwater reactor technology could improve their submarine reactors, whichcould be detrimental to U.S. security interests if relations with Chinadeteriorate. However, it appears that the only significant advantagethat would accrue would be a general upgrading of management practicesand quality control, which would be available from any other nuclearsupplier. If the opportunity for the sale of nuclear equipment to Chinaemerges, the nuclear technology transfer that would be involved, if carefullymanaged, should contribute to the national interest.</TEXT></DOC>
