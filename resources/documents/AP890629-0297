(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Vestron Inc., running out of cash afterlosing a $100 million line of credit, said Thursday it had severelycurtailed its film production and distribution business and laid offabout 140 employees.   ``This is a cash squeeze put on by Security Pacific National Bankrevoking their loan,'' said Stephen Einhorn, executive vicepresident and chief financial officer of Stamford-based Vestron.   ``The layoffs are the result of the practical matter of aconstricted cash situation. We are really unable to do thedistribution and production that the staff is there to do,'' Einhornsaid   He said the affected employees were notified Thursday of thelayoffs, which were effective immediately.   Einhorn said Vestron has been severely damaged by the revocationof the credit line in October. Security Pacific has not made clearits reason for withdrawing the credit, he said.   Vestron company has been working to establish new sources offinancing by Monday, the day its short-term credit line from WellsFargo Bank expires.   The layoffs came mostly at Vestron Pictures, the company's filmproduction arm, said J. Garrett Blower, a company spokesman.   ``While we intend to persevere, we will have to do so on thebasis of a more narrowly defined business plan,'' Austin O. FurstJr., Vestron's chairman and chief executive officer, said in astatement.   The 8-year-old company's domestic home video business will not bechanged and some motion picture projects will continue, Einhorn said.   Among Vestron's completed or near-finished films are ``LittleMonsters,'' starring Fred Savage; ``Fear'' with Ally Sheedy; and``Blue Steel'' with Jamie Lee Curtis. Einhorn said it has not beendetermined how or if Vestron will release the films.   Despite the cutbacks, the company will continue to push forwardwith production of ``Dirty Dancing II,'' the sequel to ``DirtyDancing,'' Einhorn said. ``Dirty Dancing'' grossed $60 million in1987 and was Vestron Pictures' sole major success.   Vestron Pictures' current releases include ``Earth Girls AreEasy,'' ``The Rainbow,'' ``Wonderland'' and ``Far From Home.''   Vestron Pictures was launched in January 1986 as an offshoot ofVestron Video, at that time the country's largest independent videocasette distributor.   Vestron has announced its intention to sell its The Video Storechain of retail video rental outlets.</TEXT></DOC>
