Stelio Demark, president of ABB Robotics, said at a newsconference at the Hanover Industrial Fair that if potentialEuropean customers bring their automation level up to that ofSweden, it would create a demand for 200,000 machines.</LP><TEXT>   In Sweden, there are six such machines in use per 1,000workers, he said, adding that Germany, the second mostautomated European country, has three machines per 1,000workers. Japan uses far more automation, he said, with 16robotic units per 1,000 workers.   Mr. Demark said ABB Robotics already has sold 1,000 of theIRB 6,000 model and said delivery would begin this summer. Hesaid the company hopes to sell 1,000 units a year. Themachines cost 185,000 marks ($110,000).   He said ABB sees great market potential in the electronicsand aerospace industries, as well as in others. But, he said,&quot;it's still a fact of life that automotive is the mostimportant sector.&quot;   As labor markets grow tighter and wages rise, businesseswill increasingly see robots as a way to increaseproductivity, said Mr. Demark. ABB Robotics now has 15% to20% of the world market and 30% of the European market, hesaid.</TEXT></DOC>
