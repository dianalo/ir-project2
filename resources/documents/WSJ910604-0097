The U.S. informally obtained this commitment from the 19other members of the so-called Australia Group that met inParis late last month. The group, which consists of the U.S.,14 of its North Atlantic Treaty Organization allies, plusJapan, Australia, Switzerland, Austria and Ireland, agreed toadopt export regulations for such equipment similar to thosethe U.S. had put into effect unilaterally in March, accordingto Commerce Department officials. The rules cover processingequipment that are commonly used for such things as food,pharmaceuticals and fertilizers.</LP><TEXT>   The group also agreed to follow the U.S. example ofexpanding to 50 from 11 a list of chemicals that requireexport licenses because the chemicals could be used to makepoison gas. The Paris meeting thus advanced the prospects formultilateral enforcement of two of President Bush's threeinitial measures to control the spread of this dangeroustechnology.   However, the other 19 members put off until December adecision on whether to emulate the U.S. policy of extendingexport controls to technical data, software and othernonlicensed commodities that are bound for certain suspectfacilities.   U.S. exporters, who already are subject to all of thesecontrols, welcomed the Paris commitments as an important steptoward getting the entire international community to sharethe burden of deterring the proliferation of such technology.However, Randolph Stayin, a lawyer for threeprocessing-equipment trade associations, cautioned that manyof the products to be controlled are widely available outsidethe Australia Group. &quot;Some of our members have licensed theirtechnology to nonmembers like India and Taiwan,&quot; he said.   Moreover, it could take some time before the rest of theAustralia Group's commitments are translated into actualexport regulations, said Eric Wemple, a Washington-basedexport-control consultant. The group, which isn't bound by aformal treaty, functions merely as a forum for exchanginginformation about trade in potentially dangerous chemicals.   The Commerce Department said it will have to revise itsregulations on processing-equipment controls to make themconform with the consensus that emerged from the Parismeeting. In one respect, the rules will be broadened toinclude equipment that contains specific levels of chromium,or certain kinds of glass-lined vessels andcorrosion-resistant polymers. However, reactor vessels andother equipment below a certain size will be dropped from thecurrent controls, the department said.   The revised rules are to be disclosed later this month.</TEXT></DOC>
