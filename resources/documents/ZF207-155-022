(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Micro DBMS SoftwareandM;Last year's arguments about relationality and the Structured Query Languagehave dwindled with the arrival of new industrial-strength microcomputerdatabase management systems.andM;Some micro database managers now legitimately can be called systems.andP;  Thesehardware-software hybrids have powerful capabilities and complexconfigurations.andM;Early PC database software could not emulate the traditional mainframe modelof multiuser access to a sigle database, simply because PCs at first weresingle-user devices.andP;  Their architectural uniqueness gave applicationsprogramming higher value than data handling.andM;The emergence of local area networks signaled a return to multiuserenvironments, yet the design of most micro DBMS products still did not lenditself to real multiuser systems.andM;Some DBMS developers tried to optimize performance after the fact byreworking their single-user products for LANs.andP;  A few recognized that networkoperation presents a host of new performance challenges beyond simplyavoiding multiuser collisions in an old-style DBMS.andP;  Nor could operatingsystems at the time support all the features of true distributed databases.andM;About the same time, several new applications languages began evolving.andP;  Anyone of them could build a single-user database application with more or lessthe same results.andP;  But not many could communicate with each other or sharedata.andM;In all but the simplest scenarious, the bestselling early database products,including Ashton-Tate Corp.'s dBase family, were pretty good at applicationsprogramming but weak at manipulating data.andM;Of course, the mainframe world had solved such problems long before.andP;  AfterE.F.andP;  Codd first proposed his relational model in the early 1970s, languagessuch as Structured Query Language and databases like IBM Corp.'s DB2 began toappear.andM;From the mainframe model came an architecture for distributing and movingdata via common database algebra and a common query language design.andM;Multiuser NetworkandM;It became clear that good multiuser micro databases would have to be built ona good multiuser network platform and network operating system.andP;  Theoperating system would have to incorporate the underpinnings needed bydistributed databases as well as to facilitate the shift from file servers todatabase servers.andM;Database servers were born from the need to distribute network operatingsystems as well as files.andP;  If a consistent model for database architectureand a consistent query language could be achieved, data portability at lastcould become a fact.andM;If 1988 was the year that LANs reached maturity as operating environments,then 1989 will be the year that databases grow into true distributedmultiuser systems.andM;Codd's relational model has evolved into the SQL because accessing data onPCs no longer was enough.andP;  Users wanted universal access to data on LANs,mainframes and minicomputers.andP;  They wanted to share and manipulate that datatransparently on a variety of networks.andM;Unfortunately, running on a network is not the same as running with adatabase server.andP;  Many of today's so-called network databases are onlywarmed-over versions of single-user products.andP;  Multiple file-managementfunctions such as joins and updates take place at the workstation and aretransmitted to the data wherever it resides -- usually on a file server.andM;But a file server merely is a repository of files.andP;  The workstation user whomanipulates files in workstation memory views the file server as just anotherfixed disk.andM;After the workstation does all the work, it then takes control of the networkto transmit it updates back to the file server.andM;If the network or workstation should fail during these talks, the data getscorrupted or lost.andM;Another drawback of file servers is that users or their applications have toknow where data resides in order to access it.andP;  Connectivity to multipledatabases usually is not transparent.andM;Concurrency, which means more than one user can access and write to adatabase record simultaneously, is difficult to maintain.andM;And data integrity, even with watered-down commit and rollback functions, canbe questionable under some circumstances.andM;With a database server, on the other hand, most if not all of this actiontakes place at the server instead of at the workstation.andP;  Only the resultsare transmitted to the workstation.andP;  That lessens the load on the network,especially at the drive where bottlenecks are most likely.andM;Data integrity is preserved because a workstation failure usually has noeffect at all on data, while data distributed on other servers is handled bya central database server.andM;In case of server failure, good systems preserve a pre-update image to rollback the single lost transaction.andP;  The server, not the user, keeps track ofwhere the other data tables reside.andM;Can Be CostlyandM;On the negative side, today's database servers do take up large amounts ofworkstation and server memory, and with one exception they do not run underMS-DOS.andP;  The new breed of network database is not cheap in dollar terms,either.andM;Database servers intelligently manipulate multiuser data; files servers donot.andP;  In a true distributed database using a database server, the serveritself manages the data under instructions from the workstation.andM;The workstation is the front end where the application resides.andP;  The databaseserver is the back end, or engine, that manages the data.andP;  How muchintelligence the workstation must supply depends on the distributedarchitecture.andM;Within the domain of the database server, there are two distinct methods ofmanaging data at several different locations.andP;  The first, referred to asdistributed database technology, assumes that data may reside on any of anumber of database servers.andM;When a workstation queries a server, that server accesses any other serversholding data relevant to the query and performs the required relationaloperation.andP;  It then returns the result to the workstation.andM;A simple distributed database system could use dumb terminals asworkstations, leaving the application at some central server.andP;  Although inmost LANs the application does in fact reside at the workstation, the datadictionary that tells the database where data tables reside is at thedatabase server.andM;Cooperative ProcessingandM;The second form of database server technology is what IBM Corp. and GuptaTechnologies Inc., Menlo Park, Calif., call cooperative processing, in whichsome of the database intelligence resides at the workstation.andM;With multiple data tables, the workstation sends its SQL query out to theappropriate database servers, collects the information and processes thereply.andM;Data on the various servers then is updated according to instructionsprovided in the query.andP;  If the application resides at the workstations, theworkstation must have a map of where data is located on the various servers.andM;Gupta's products manage this mapping with a driver module called SQLRouter,which knows the nodes on which all databases reside.andM;Users who handle a large amount of data on a sizable local area networkprobably need such a routing product.andP;  The bigger and more complex thenetwork and data management requirements, the greater the need for a seriousdistributed database server.andM;Making a transition to the new breed of database calls for some toughdecisions.andP;  Years of data may have been built into a large resource that runson an outdated system.andP;  A large body of applications written and fine-tunedover the years may need salvaging.andM;Almost all serious database products available in 1989 have the ability toimport a variety of data file formats.andP;  The most popular is the flat ASCIIfile with individual fields delimited by commas.andP;  Fields often are enclosedwithin quotation marks.andM;Comma-delimited files are the  most common format for moving data from onedatabase to another.andP;  Another popular format is the dBase format.andP;  However,most products are limited to import only.andM;Notable exceptions will come from Oracle Corp., Gupta Technologies and NovellInc., which have signed agreements with WordTech Systems Inc., Orinda,Calif., that will lead to new dBase front-ends and SQL database servers.andM;These systems can access either a dBase file or an SQL table directly.andP;  Theywill convert between formats internally when necessary.andM;Reading SpreadsheetsandM;Another product, dQuery from Quadbase Systems Inc., Sunnyvale, Calif., readsdBase and Lotus 1-2-3 files and treats them as SQL tables.andP;  DQuery also cancreate an SQL table either directly or from dBase/Lotus files, and it canperform relational joins among tables and files.andM;However, application file portability is another matter entirely.andP;  Unless oneof the new database products has a front end directly compatible with itspredecessor or some clone product, new application code must be written.andM;There is some good news even here, though.andP;  The new dBase-like productscoming from WordTech and its marketing partners have some compatibility, andno one should count out Ashton-Tate itself.andM;DBase IV Release 1.1 and SQL Server, due out this spring, will use dBase IIIPlus files directly, while application files can be rewritten to takeadvantage of some of the new dBase IV commands.andM;Applications will run faster, due in part to the on-board pseudocompiler indBase IV.andP;  Of course, Oracle Quicksilver, already available, will compiledBase applications with the Oracle SQL engine.andM;Quicksilver-compiled applications, unlike dBase IV equivalents, are trueexecutable files and require no run-time program to execute.andP;  They aresmaller and faster than their dBase IV siblings.andM;Two other new-breed products bear consideration in the applicationportability derby.andP;  Paradox 3.0 from Borland International Inc., ScottsValley, Calif., soon will have an interface for Oracle's SQL engine.andP;  Thatmeans Paradox users will find it as easy as dBase users to move theirapplications directly into the SQL world.andM;Advanced Revelation from Revelation Technology Inc., New York, also will beable to interface directly with Gupta Technology SQLBase.andP;  Although AdvancedRevelation has fewer users than either Paradox or dBase, most databaseexperts agree that it truly is a heavy-duty applications developmentenvironment.andM;According to Revelation's president Jim Acquaviva, current applicationswritten in Advanced Revelation will be directly portable to SQLBase.andO;Revelation has made arrangements with Oracle and Microsoft Corp. to producesimilar products for their platforms in 1989.andM;Server DifferencesandM;Most of these products are not yet available.andP;  However, there are strongindications that several database server systems will be up and runningbefore the end of 1989.andP;  The only one available now that runs on both MS-DOSand OS/2 machines is Gupta's SQLBase.andM;As discussed above, there is a significant difference between a traditionalfile server and a database server.andP;  Most database servers must work undereither OS/2 or Xenix in a PC environment.andM;The exception is the Gupta offering.andP;  In most cases, the workstations wherethe applications reside may be either MS-DOS or OS/2.andM;Oracle's entry-level product, Professional Oracle, will run entirely on asingle PC.andP;  While it uses the Oracle database engine, it is not a databaseserver.andP;  It does allow the creation of real Oracle database tables andapplications.andM;Professional Oracle requires 640K RAM plus 896K of extended RAM.andP;  It alsotakes up 6M on a hard disk before starting to build databases.andM;In the distributed database environment, Oracle contains the software for theworkstation that will access Oracle data on a mainframe, mini or network.andO;Networkstation Oracle can run under MS-DOS or in the DOS compatibility box onOS/2.andP;  It requires 640K RAM and 4.5M of hard-disk space.andM;Although Networkstation Oracle has no database, it is a full applicationsdevelopment environment that expects to address data on a server.andM;The Oracle database server, LANserver Oracle, must run under Xenix andcontains everything necessary to communicate fully with the rest of a localarea network.andP;  It requires 3M RAM, Xenix 2.2 for Santa Cruz Operation Inc.,andO;Santa Cruz, Calif., and an Ethernet card on the workstations that willcommunicate with it.andM;Networkstation Oracle communicates with any Oracle database on a mini, LAN ormainframe via the SQL-Net networking module.andM;Oracle now is shipping Oracle Quicksilver, a direct competitor to theannounced but not yet shipping Ashton-Tate SQL Server.andP;  Oracle Quicksilver isa dBase/dBXL compiler that can produce applications to address an Oracledatabase directly.andM;If that database is on a database server, as it most likely will be, users ofdBase applications can compile them with Oracle Quicksilver and have accessto data on any of the hardware platforms Oracle supports.andM;SQL, dBase UnitedandM;In effect, Oracle Quicksilver brings SQL and dBase together, exploiting theprogramming power of the dBase language and the data-handling power ofOracle's SQL.andM;Gupta Technologies has produced the first database server that runs underMS-DOS.SQLBase is a full-fledged cooperative processing database serversystem including the server, communications elements for a network and anapplications programming interface (API) that allows SQL statements to beembedded in other languages such as C.andM;The API is important to the Gupta product because it allows users to developinterfaces for a variety of languages.andP;  Late in 1988, WordTech Systemsannounced it would interface to SQLBase with dBXL and Quicksilver products inmuch the same manner as it already had done with Oracle.andP;  RevelationTechnologies recently made the same announcement.andM;Planet Software, London, England, plans an API-level interface for Clipper,the dBase compiler from Nantucket Corp., Los Angeles.andM;The Planet product is the simplest of all so far because it provides alibrary of API-level calls that are compiled into a Clipper application asobject modules.andP;  The Clipper-compiled application then has direct access toGupta or IBM DB2 databases through SQL statements.andM;The resource requirements for Gupta's products are not quite so prodigious asOracle's.andP;  SQLBase requires 640K of memory for the server and 512K at theworkstation.andM;Gupta supports Token-Ring, Ethernet and all other NetBIOS networks.andO;SQLNetwork is a separate module that interconnects the server to a mainframerunning DB2.andM;With SQLNetwork, workstations running SQLBase can access mainframe datadirectly and transparently through their applications.andM;Although Ashton-Tate's SQL Server is not yet available, it is the productagainst which the new breed of database system will be compared.andP;  sQL Serveris built around Microsoft's OS/2 LAN Manager, and basically allows the sametypes of applications as Oracle and Gupta.andM;Accessing Server DataandM;Using SQL Server, workstations can access server data either with interactiveSQL statements or with SQL embedded in dBase IV applications.andP;  However, SQLServer demands formidable resources.andM;The server must be running OS/2, OS/2 LAN Manager or IBM LAN Server, the IBMimplementation of LAN Manager.andP;  Minimum hardware is an 80286- or 80386-classmachine with 6M RAM and a 30M fixed disk.andM;The workstation may be MS-DOS with 640K RAM or OS/2 with 2M memory.andP;  LANManager Enhanced Redirector also is required on the workstation, as is afixed disk.andM;There now are several ways to achieve data portability and connectivity witha reasonably consistent query language and database model.andP;  But potentialusers of the new breed of micro database still face a few obstacles.andM;The likeliest scenario for a multiuser database is on an isolated LAN whereusers may need to address data on another LAN or their own, but never on minior mainframe databases.andM;A second scenario assumes that LAN users need to access data on a largerhardware platform in a format suitable for a directly compatible LAN product.andM;Finally, some LAN users will need virtually universal access to data on avariety of platforms running in a variety of environments.andM;The isolated LAN is the easiest to serve.andP;  Any of the new distributeddatabase server products will work well so long as reasonable consistency ismaintained from LAN to LAN.andM;In other words, users who are just starting to convert fromearlier-generation database management systems can stay with the sameproducts across network boundaries.andP;  DBase users will buy one of the newdBase/dBXL products, Paradox users soon will have their favorite DBMS' newestversion and so on.andM;The homogeneous environment where a particular database alrady exists on alarge platform also is easy to address.andP;  If Oracle is running on a DigitalEquipment Corp. VAX under VMS for example, Oracle should be put on the LAN.andM;But if mixed platforms are involved, such as VAX VMS or IBM MVS running IBM'sDB2, requirements must be evaluated carefully.andP;  One solution is the Guptaofferings, which provide a reasonably universal SQL.andM;Applications PortabilityandM;On the other hand, Oracle also can address DB2 directly with its OracleQuicksilver dBase/SQL package.andM;Finally comes the issue of applications portability, as discussed above.andP;  Ifthe new database is to be built around one of the new breed of DBMS products,it will need a suitable LAN platform before the user chooses a DBMS.andM;The new DBMS software does promise some exciting developments.andP;  Two yearsago, some database developers were predicting there would be nothing new inthe DBMS world except more speed and programming commands and bigger files.andO;They did not foresee a quantum leap in technology.andM;To the degree that todayhs heavy-duty database products tend to be&quot;micro-ized&quot; mainframe products, perhaps taht assessment is accurate.andM;But mainframe techniques are being adapted today largely because of advancesin LAN technology.andM;It appears that certain techniques now in general use on micro databaseproducts would not be appropriate for mainframe applications.andP;  Windowsbrowsing, for example, is not common with mainframes.andM;One area where the DBMS community is making real headway is in the userinterface.andP;  Interfaces on advanced microcomputer products are completelyunique in the computer industry.andM;Larry Hauptman, former president of the now-defunct Condor Computer Corp., amicro DBMS pioneer, commented in 1987 that database users were turning intothe database programmers of the future.andP;  That prediction is fast coming true.andM;Major developers such as Ashton-Tate, Lotus Development Corp., Apple ComputerInc. and others are obsessed by look-and-feel issues.andP;  The user interface isconsidered so proprietary that even minor infringements generate lawsuits.andM;This issue goes much farther than simple program operation.andP;  It cuts to theheart of applications development.andM;Who are the users and applications developers of the future?andP;  As userinterfaces, development languages and query languages become more accessible,users will merge with developers.andM;The User InterfaceandM;The user interface may take one of several directions in the near future.andO;First, natural-language front ends may evolve from artifical intelligence andfifth-generation languages.andM;A second direction, foreshadowed by Apple's desktop icons, is beginning tocapture user interest.andP;  Developments include Hewlett-Packard Co.'s New Wave,Apple's Agents, and so-called capsules from Metaphor Computer Systems,Mountain View, Calif., a company formerly known for custom workstations andnetwork operating systems.andM;Metaphor is working on a user interface in which program elements arerepresented as icons called capsules.andP;  The idea is that individual programsor program elements represented by the icons can be joined togethergraphically to create a complete application.andM;Of course, Oracle Quicksilver, dBase IV and SQL Server will let users keepusing their familiar dBase application code, or the faster and simpler SQL,or both.andP;  Thus user interfaces in the 1990s may be similar to the dBase IVControl Center and the query-by-example facilities of Paradox.andM;Another interface trend is to record the user's manual actions interactivelythrough a very simple user interface, converting that procedure into thebasis of an application.andP;  Virtually no real programming is required on thepart of the user to produce a program.andM;New research on distributed databases will result in ever-increasingmanipulative power and flexibility.andM;Certainly there will be plenty of products for power users.andM;But the market will hve to make a choice among icon-based interfaces,query-by-example, traditional procedural programming and interactive menus.andM;Meanwhile, it appears that server-based database management is here to stay,at least on industrial-strength networks.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
