The study, sponsored by the National Governors Association and the National Conference of State Legislatures, covered a total of 8,300 schools and almost certainly will touch off more debate on the troubled guaranteed student loan program.    The study found 427 post-secondary schools with default rates of more than 60% among their students, accounting for about 3% of all defaults.    Among the 427, the states' report listed 34 that had more than $1 million each in cumulative default volume. In addition, another 34 had at least a 40% default rate and more than $5 million each in bad debts among their students.    Since 1979, annual defaults under the program have surged four-fold to about $1.26 billion a year, with more than $5.6 billion in total defaults.    Under the guaranteed student loan program, the federal government provides interest subsidies to banks making the loans, and also insures or guarantees the loans against default. About $73 billion has been loaned under the program or its predecessors, with about $43 billion outstanding.    The states' study, released yesterday, is the first to give details of the default rates and amounts by individual schools. It found a high concentration of defaulted student loans in &quot;proprietary,&quot; or for-profit training and vocational schools that get a high proportion of their operating funds from federal loan and grant programs.    In one recent case, the U.S. Education Department seeks to terminate guaranteed-loan eligibility for Bowling Green Junior College, Bowling Green, Ky. The department has alleged abuses of the program in which the school kept tuition money from students who received loans and dropped out.    Yesterday, officials at the college weren't available for comment.    Analysts responsible for the study say they suspect similar abuses of the program elsewhere, but said they couldn't tell how widespread these might be.    At least part of the reason for the increased default rate, says Mark Wolfe, one of the analysts, is tightened eligibility requirements instituted by the Reagan administration. Under these rules, more-affluent students can't qualify for the loans, leaving a higher percentage of poor students in the program.    &quot;There's some question about whether these loan programs shouldn't just be direct grants,&quot; said Vic Miller, another of the analysts.    The Education Department has advocated lowering the amount of loans the federal government would guarantee to students at schools where the default rates were high. Several senators also have sponsored a measure that would permit certain guarantor agencies to deny loans to students at schools where the default rates exceed 25%.    Among the study's 68 schools with high default rates and large amounts of bad debt were several branches of the City University of New York, one of the nation's largest public universities with 183,000 students.    Five CUNY schools, including the well-known City College and Bronx Community College, had default rates in excess of 40% with total cumulative defaults of $38 million.    &quot;About two-thirds of our students are getting some form of financial aid and many of them have extremely low incomes, and that might be part of the explanation,&quot; said a CUNY spokesman.    The study also found several for-profit chains of beauty and business schools with students having high default rates. Five schools operated by the Wilfred Academy of Hair and Beauty Culture in New York and Pennsylvania had default rates in excess of 40%, with about $25 million in bad debts among its students.    Edward Blankstein, financial aid director of Wilfred American Educational Corp., which operates the Wilfred schools, said in a statement that the states' study &quot;was like blaming the hospitals for patients who fail to pay their hospital bills.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
