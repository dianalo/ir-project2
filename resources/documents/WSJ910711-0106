Yesterday's rally is fanning speculation that grain pricesmight be recovering from the steep plunge in June. Althoughfew traders expect grain prices to strengthen significantlysoon, some expect the market to move in a sideways direction.</LP><TEXT>   In trading at the Chicago Board of Trade yesterday, thecorn contract for July delivery rose 3.5 cents a bushel tosettle at $2.28. The soybean contract for July delivery rose2.5 cents a bushel to settle at $5.255.   During the trading session yesterday, several privateweather forecasters increased their odds for hot and dryweather over the Midwest next week. That type of weather hasthe potential to trim the potential yield of the young corncrop in states such as Iowa, where much of the crop will bein the pollination stage. The corn plant is the mostvulnerable to harsh weather during that stage of thereproductive cycle.   The soybean crop is less vulnerable than corn at this timeof the growing season, however some meteorologists areconcerned about dry conditions in some sections of theMidwest, such as southeast Iowa.   The expectation that next week will be hot and dry got aboost after the close of trading yesterday when the NationalWeather Service released a six-to-10 day forecast for muchabove normal temperatures in major farm states such as Iowa,Illinois, Indiana and Missouri. The National Weather Servicealso predicted below normal precipitation for Illinois andIndiana, and normal precipitation in Iowa.   Previous hot spells have caused little damage, in partbecause they haven't lingered. &quot;The big question is how longit will stick around,&quot; said Harvey Freese, a meteorologist atFreese-Notis Weather in Des Moines, Iowa.   Grain prices were also supported by continuing rumors thatthe Soviet Union is completing the bank financing necessaryto import large amounts of U.S. crops. Speculation aboutSoviet buying helped push up crop prices Tuesday.   Wheat prices rose yesterday on anticipation that theAgriculture Department will lower its estimate of the softred winter wheat crop that was recently harvested in theMidwest. An unusually wet and warm spring triggered a diseaseoutbreak that reduced yields.   In trading at the Chicago Board of Trade, the wheatcontract for July delivery rose 7.25 cents a bushel to settleat $2.625.   The government is slated to release a monthly crop reportafter the close of trading today. Some traders expect theAgriculture Department to predict a soft red winter wheatharvest of roughly 375 million bushels, down about 25 millionbushels from the June estimate.   Traders, however, foresee sizable corn and soybeanharvests this fall. Crop prices are depressed because growingconditions have been nearly ideal throughout much of theMidwest so far this year.   Traders generally expect the Agriculture Department topredict a corn harvest of roughly 8.15 billion bushels and asoybean harvest of about two billion bushels.   In other commodity markets yesterday:                                                                                                          ENERGY: Petroleum product prices rose in firm trading onbullish inventory news. Crude oil contracts also advanced,although not as much. Gasoline for August delivery settled at64.21 cents a gallon, up 0.77 cent on the New York MercantileExchange. The August contract for heating oil rose morestrongly, finishing at 58.38 cents a gallon, up 1.07 cents.On Tuesday afternoon the American Petroleum Institutereported that gasoline inventories fell sharply in the latestweek and heating oil stocks fell slightly. Some marketparticipants were puzzled by the price gain in heating oil.But others said that the small decrease in heating oilinventories was bullish for this time of year, when heatingoil stocks are being built to meet winter demand. Meanwhile,crude oil for August delivery on the New York Merc settled at$21.43 a barrel, up 14 cents. The contract traded between$21.29 and $21.49.                                                                                                          PRECIOUS METALS: Platinum prices fell, with the contractfor October delivery dropping $4.40 an ounce to $383.50.William O'Neill, futures strategist at Merrill Lynch, citedreaction to Atlantic Richfield Co.'s new gasoline formuladesigned to cut car emissions sharply, which traders fearedcould reduce the need for platinum in catalytic converters.Mr. O'Neill doubted Arco's gasoline would hurt platinumdemand, noting other low-emission gasolines on the markethaven't caused any decline in platinum use. Nina Lipton,research manager at Platinum Guild International (USA), atrade group, disputed that the Arco news affected the market,and instead blamed technical factors for the decline inprices. The gasoline won't replace catalytic converters oraffect platinum use, she agreed. Mr. O'Neill also pointed tothe lifting of sanctions against South Africa as anothercause of platinum's weakness. Traders may be nervous aboutthe prospect of more supply from South Africa hitting themarket, he said, but the removal of sanctions probably willhave a minimal effect on the supply.                                                                                                          COPPER: Expectations of a settlement soon in the labordispute at Codelco's Chuiquicamata mine in Chile sent futuresprices lower. Copper for September delivery lost 1.7 cents apound to finish at 99.1 cents. Late yesterday, a Codelcoofficial was reported as saying he was optimistic the strikecould be settled within 48 hours, but there wasn't acorroborating statement by any union official, said HerbertRhodes, manager of commercial metals services for ATandamp;TNetwork Cable Systems. Richard Hirsch, vice president ofSharps Pixley, noted that prices have been slipping sincelast week, indicating traders have been anticipating a strikesettlement for several days. Prices rose above $1.03 earlylast week and have been generally falling since July 3. Alsoaffecting prices are concerns about weak demand, Mr. Rhodessaid.</TEXT></DOC>
