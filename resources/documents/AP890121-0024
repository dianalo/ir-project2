At least 75 smugglers already have been executed this month inthe fiercest crackdown since the early days of the Islamicrevolution, when hundreds of alleged drug users and pushers wererounded up and killed.   The new campaign followed the Aug. 20 cease-fire in the Iran-Iraqwar and an alarming surge in drug abuse blamed on hardships causedby the 8-year conflict, worsening unemployment and Iran's religiousban on alcohol.   The laws mandate death for people convicted of possessing 30grams, or just over an ounce, of heroin, codeine or morphine orsmuggling 11 pounds of opium or hashish. Simple possession of opiumor hashish carries a jail term.   ``We have no fear of increasing statistics on executions becausethose who become the victims of the traders of death are far greaterin number than the smugglers,'' said Mohammad-Mousavi Khoeiniha,Iran's prosecutor-general, on Tehran radio.   Official figures on drug abuse in Iran are not available. ButParliament Speaker Hashemi Rafsanjani recently indicated the scaleof the crisis by referring to ``the devastating problem of drugabuse ... a blight that has ruined some of our young people.''   ``The problem ... is a political one,'' said Iran's chiefjustice, Ayatollah Musavi Ardebili. ``The superpowers, just as theyfought the Islamic revolution on the battlefield and in the economicfield ... use narcotics as one method to battle with the people ...and taint the revolution.''   Even before the new law came into force, Iranian authorities hadrounded up more than 1,000 suspected smugglers and pushers, runningthem through Islamic tribunals and hanging them as soon as they werefound guilty.   On Jan. 7, 19 smugglers were hanged or shot by firing squads.   Tehran's radical Jomhuri Islami daily hailed the executions as``a landmark on the path to eradicating narcotics.''   Nine days later, Iran's official media said 56 were executed inone day in various cities, a chilling display of Tehran'sdetermination to eliminate drugs.   Jomhuri Islami urged that authorities ``put an end to thedisgraceful life of a few who take joy in ruining a nation only tofill their pockets.   ``It's much better if some families lose their breadwinners inthis way than a nation loses its youth.''   The new law was announced Dec. 5 by the 13-member ExpediencyCouncil, a body with special powers set up in February by AyatollahRuhollah Khomeini to speed legislation snarled in Parliament.   Apart from the death sentences, the law provides for a minimum20-year prison term for anyone convicted of addicting another personto drugs. Those convicted of causing widespread addiction could alsoface death.   The Expediency Council gave drug addicts six months to kick theirhabits or face imprisonment.   Mokhtar Kalantari, deputy commander of the Islamic RevolutionaryCommittees, which have largely taken over law enforcement frompolice, acknowledged shortcomings in recent years in combatting thenarcotics trade from neighboring Afghanistan and Pakistan while Iranconcentrated on the war with Iraq. There are extensive poppy fieldsin Iran as well.   Officials say large quantities of narcotics are smuggled throughIran into Turkey and the Soviet Union.   Former President Abolhassan Bani-Sadr, in exile in France,claimed in a recent New York Times interview that the Tehrangovernment is involved in the drug trade ``to make ends meet,''earning $2 billion a year from it.   Kalantari predicted with the new laws that authorities willeliminate 80 percent of the narcotics trade within two years.</TEXT></DOC>
