NHA section 408(s)(3). (the FSLIC may, at its option,extend the time frame for disapproval by an additional thirty days. <T3>Id.</T3>)<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ CEBA section 107(b) provides for the establishment ofmutual bank holding companies for savings banks and cooperative banks insuredby the federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the ``FDIC'). <T3>See section 3(g) of the bank Holding Company Act of 1956, 12 U.S.C.1842. A number of state statutes also provide for state chartered mutualholding companies. Unless the context clearly indicates otherwise, allreferences herein to ``mutual holding companies'' are intended to refereonly to mutual </T3><T3>savings and loan</T3> holding companies established pursuant to NHAsection 408(s).The FSLIC is authorized to disapprove a proposed mutual holding companyreorganization if (i) the FSLIC finds that the financial or managerialresources of the insured institution are inadequate or that the reorganizationwould otherwise threaten the safety and soundness of the institution; (ii)the insured institution fails to provide the FSLIC with information requiredby regulation or by specific request; or (iii) the institution fails toobtain approval of the reorganization from its board of directors and votingmembers. NHA section 408(s)(3)(C). In addition, and as a separate matter,the FSLIC is authorized to review and approve the proposed capitalizationof mutual holding companies. NHA section 408(s)(3)(D). In no event maya mutual holding company be capitalized at a level that would deprive thenewly formed subsidiary insured institution of sufficient capital to complywith the Board's minimum capital requirements, as set forth at 12 CFR 563.13.NHA section 408(s)(3)(D).Mutual holding companies are permitted to ``acquire * * * through merger''additional mutual insured institutions or mutual FDIC insured savings banks,to ``acquire'' or ``merge with'' other savings and loan holding companies,to ``invest'' in the stock of insured institutions, and to ``invest'' inany other corporation ``the capital stock of which is available for purchaseby an insured institution under Federal law or under the law of any Statewhere the subsidiary insured institution or institutions [of the mutualholding company] have their home offices.'' NHA section 408(s)(5). If theterm ``invest'' is interpreted in a manner that includes acquisitions ofcontrolling blocks of stock in any corporation whose stock may be purchasedby insured institutions under Federal law or the relevant State law (<T3>see</T3> discussion below under Item 5), then it appears that mutualholding companies would be able to engage, indirectly via subsidiaries,in a broad range of business activities. If instead the term is interpretedin a manner that includes only passive, non-controlling investments, thenthe permissible business activities of subsidiaries of mutual holding companieswill be coextensive with the business activities that mutual holding companiesare permitted to engage in directly,<T3> i.e., </T3>those specified in NHA section 408(c)(2), exclusive ofsubclause (B) thereof (conducting an insurance agency or escrow business).NHA section 408(s)(5)(E). A mutual holding company that ``acquires'' or``merges with'' a savings and loan holding company that engages in activitiesor holds assets that are impermissible for mutual holding companies mustcause those nonconforming activities and/or assets to be disposed of orterminated within two years of such acquisition or merger. NHA section408(s)(6).Except as noted above, mutual holding companies are subject to the samestatutory and regulatory provisions as are applicable to savings and loanholding companies generally, including (without limitation) provisionsregarding transactions with affiliates, NHA section 408(d), (p), and (t),acquisitions of insured institutions, NHA section 408(e), declaration ofdividends, NHA section 408(f), holding company indebtedness, NHA section408(g), management interlocks, NHA section 408(i), and Board regulationsimplementing the foregoing statutory provisions, 12 CFR Parts 574, 583,and 584. NHA section 408(s)(7).<ITAG tagnum="84">Discussion</ITAG>The Board, as operating head of the FSLIC, is authorized to promulgatesuch regulations ``as it deems necessary or appropriate to enable it toadminister and carry out the purposes of'' NHA section 408(s), as describedabove. NHA section 408(h)(1). In reviewing section 408(s), the Board hasnoted that a number of important issues that will have to be addressedin its implementing regulations are either not addressed or not definitivelyresolved by the statutory language. Accordingly, the Board has decidedto seek public comment on certain key issues before promulgating a detailedset of proposed regulations. The issues are as follows:1. What is the essential juridicial nature of a mutual holding company?NHA section 408(s) specifies that a mutual insured institution ``may recognizeso as to become a mutual holding company'' by chartering an interim subsidiarystock insured institution and transferring a substantial part of the mutualinsured institutions assets and all of its insured deposits to the subsidiaryinstitution. NHA section 408(s)(1). In other words, unlike traditionalholding company reorganization where an insured institution in the stockform incorporates a new general business corporation to serve as the newholding company, under NHA section 408(s) the mutual insured institutionitself becomes the holding company.Thus, at the end of a reorganization under section 408(s), the basic legaldocument authenticating and defining the corporate existence of a mutualholding company will be the charter of a mutual insured institution, eitherstate or federal. <T3>Cf.</T3> 12 CFR 544.1 (model charter for federal mutual associations).Although the Board could promulgate regulations requiring any mutual insuredinstitution that wishes to reorganize under section 408(s) to amend itscharter to change its name from ``<T2>XXXX</T2> Savings and Loan Association'' or ``<T2>XXXX</T2> Savings Bank'' to something reflecting its status as a mutualholding company and to specify that unless and until the mutual holdingcompany lawfully ceases to operate as a mutual holding company (<T3>see</T3> Item 10 below) it may exercise only such powers as are setforth in NHA section 408(s)(5), these amendments seemingly would not alterthe fundamental fact that the mutual holding company will still be an entitychartered under the relevant federal or state statute providing for theformation of thrift institutions. <T3>See </T3>Home Owners Loan Act, section 5(a), 12 U.S.C. 1464(a).This raises the question whether mutual insured institutions that becomemutual holding companies should be deemed to retain their fundamental identityas ``insured institutions'' for the purpose of determining the applicabilityof various statutory and regulatory provisions such as (i) NHA section407(d) and section 21(f)(4) of the Federal Home Loan Bank Act (``FHLBankAct''), 12 U.S.C. 1441(f)(4), both of which provide for exit fees upontermination of FSLIC insurance, and (ii) NHA section 408(t), which providesan exception from the requirement of prior FSLIC approval for transactionsbetween insured institutions in same holding company structure. The answerto this question is also relevant to how securities issued by mutual holdingcompanies will be regulated under the federal securities laws. <T3>See</T3> Item 2 below.In recognition of the hybrid nature of a mutual holding company, the Boardis of the preliminary view that it should take a flexible approach to thequestion of whether a mutual holding company is an ``insured institution.''There are some statutory or regulatory provisions under which it wouldmake sense to treat mutual holding companies as insured institutions, andthere are others under which it would not. Thus, for example, for purposesof NHA section 407(a) and FHLBank Act section 21(f)(4), the Board is notinclined to view the transformation of a mutual insured institution intoa mutual holding company as a termination of insurance requiring the paymentof exit fees. The purposes of the exit fee provisions is to impose a finalpremium on deposits that are leaving the FSLIC system. In the context ofmutual holding companies, deposits are merely being relocated within theFSLIC system, indeed within the same corporate structure.In the context of NHA section 408(t), however, the Board is inclined toview mutual holding companies as traditional holding companies, ratherthan insured institutions. The exemption from prior approval provided bysection 408(t) appears to be based upon the assumption that transactionsbetween two affiliated entities within the same structure that are engagedin the same general business (<T3>i.e.,</T3> that of an insured institution) and both have FSLIC-insureddeposits do not present the same level of risk to the FSLIC fund or insuredinstitutions as do transactions between insured institutions and theirother corporate affiliates. Since the powers and activities of a mutualholding company differ significantly from those of an insured institution,more closely approximating those of a traditional savings and loan holdingcompany, NHA section 408(s)(5), and since transactions between mutual holdingcompanies and their insured institution subsidiaries would present thepossibility of a transfer of assets away from the FSLIC fund, it wouldseem more appropriate to treat mutual holding companies like typical savingsand loan holding companies for purposes of transactions with their subsidiaryinsured institutions. <T3>See</T3> NHA sections 408 (d) and (p).2. Should membership interests and/or debt securities issued by mutualholding companies be deemed subject to the Board's securities offeringregulations set forth at 12 CFR Part 563g?<ITAG tagnum="81">a. Issuance of Membership Interests</ITAG>Persons who open savings or demand deposit accounts at federally-charteredmutual savings and loan associations and savings banks automatically becomemembers of such institutions and, as such, are entitled, <T3>inter alia,</T3> to vote on certain corporate matters, to receive distributionson net earnings on the basis of accounts, and to receive certain distributionsupon liquidation. <T3>See</T3> 12 CFR 544.1 (sections 6 and 8 of Model Charter). Personswho open accounts at most state-chartered, FSLIC-insured mutual savingsand loan associations also receive similar rights. As noted above, NHAsection 408(s)(4) prescribes that persons who possess ownership rightsin mutual insured institutions that reorganize into the mutual holdingcompany format must receive the same type of ownership rights in the mutualholding companies.This raises the question of whether the issuance of such rights by mutualholding companies should be deemed to constitute the issuance of securitiessubject to the Board's securities offering regulations at 12 CFR Part 563g.Part 563g provides that ``no insured institution shall offer or sell, directlyor indirectly, any security issued by it unless the offer or sale is accompanied* * * by an offering circular which includes the information required bythis Part * * * or * * * an exemption is available under this Part.'' 12CFR 563g.2(a). For purposes of Part 563g, the term ``security'' is definedas set forth below. (For convenience of reference in the discussion thatfollows, the definition is divided into two parts.)<ITAG tagnum="16"/><T3>Part I: </T3>``Security'' means any nonwithdrawable account * * *,certificate of interest or participation in any profit-sharing agreement,collateral-trust certificate * * *, investment contract, voting trust certificateor, in general, any interest or instrument commonly known as a ``security''* * *,<ITAG tagnum="16"/><T3>Part II: </T3>except that a ``security'' shall not include an accountinsured, in whole or in part, by the Federal Savings and Loan InsuranceCorporation or the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. 12 CFR 563g.1(a)(13).In light of the foregoing, any determination that Part 563g is applicableto the interests to be issued by mutual holding companies would be dependentupon four findings: (i) That such interests fit into one or more of thespecific categories of instruments named above or othewise qualify as ``securities''under general principles of securities law, <T3>see </T3>Part I of the foregoing definition; (ii) that these interestsare, in some meaningful sense, being issued by an insured institution,<T3>see </T3>12 CFR 563g.2(a); (iii) that these interests do not qualifyfor the exemption for interests issued in connection with accounts insuredby the FSLIC or the FDIC, <T3>see, </T3>Part II of the foregoing definition; and (iv) that theseinterests are being ``offered for sale'' and ``sold.'' <T3>See </T3>12 CFR 563g.2(a).With respect to the first issue, <T3>i.e., </T3>whether interests issued by mutual holding companies constitute``securities'' within the meaning of Part I of the foregoing definition,the Board notes that Part I of the definition is virtually identical tothe definition of ``security'' set forth in section 2(1) of the SecuritiesAct of 1933 (the ``'33 Act''), 17 U.S.C. 77a <T3>et seq., </T3>and section 3(a)(10) of the Securities Exchange Act of1934 (the ``'34 Act''), 17 U.S.C. 78a <T3>et seq. </T3>Unfortunately, the existing case law discussing whethermutual ownership rights of the type described above constitute ``securities''within the meaning of section 2(1) of the '33 Act and section 3(a)(10)of the '34 Act is sparse and inconclusive. Since the issuance of such rightsby mutual insured institutions would be exempt from the registration requirementsof the '33 Act and the '34 Act even if such accounts did constitute ``securities,''<T3>see </T3>section 3(a)(5) of '33 Act and section 12(g)(2)(C) of '34Act, the only context in which the question could arise in the past wasin fraud actions brought pursuant to section 17 of the '33 Act and section10 of the '34 Act. Only a few such actions have actually been brought,and, arguably, each such action has involved membership interests thatdiffer in some significant respect from the membership interests describedabove. <T3>E.g., Tcherepnin v. Knight </T3>389 U.S. 332 (1967) (a withdrawablecapital share in an Illinois building and loan association is a ``security''within the meaning of the '34 Act primarily because the holders of suchshares are entitled to dividends, rather than a fixed rate of interest,and because the legislative history of the '33 Act suggests that interestsin bullding and loan associations were assumed to be ``securities'' requiringthe section 3(a)(5) exemption); <T3>Burrus, Coates andamp; Burrus v. MacKethan, </T3>537 F. 2d 1262 (4thCir. 1976) (a certificate of investment in an Sandamp;L is not a securitywithin the meaning of the '34 Act since the certificate is merely an accountthat pays a fixed rate of interest and confers no voting rights); <T3>Hamblett v. Board of Savings and Loan Associations of Mississippi,</T3>742 F. Supp. 158, 164-167 (N.D. Miss. 1979) (same as <T3>Burrus, </T3>except conclusion applies to both '33 Act and '34 Act);<T3>cf. also Marine Bank v. Weaver, </T3>455 U.S. 551, 556 (1982) (a certificateof deposit differs from the instrument considered in <T3>Tcherepnin, supra, </T3>in that it confers no voting rights and paysa fixed rate of interest; such CDs, especially when issued by a regulatedbank, are not ``securities'' within the meaning of the '34 Act).If the Board were to conclude that the issuance of mutual membership rightsof the type described above by mutual holding companies constitutes theissuance of ``securities'' within the meaning of Part I of the definitionset forth above, the Board would, as a second matter, have to considerwhether such ``securities'' should be deemed to be issued by insured institutions.This, of course, is linked to the analysis set forth under Item 1 above.In this regard, we also note that section 3(a)(5) of the '33 Act and section12(g)(2)(C) of the '34 Act each provide exemptions for securities issuedby ``savings and loan associations'' or ``similar institutions'' supervisedand examined by state or federal authorities. Thus, from time to time theSecurities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'') has been called upon to considerwhether a particular entity that is closely associated with a savings andloan association or an integral part of the operations of a savings andloan association should be deemed to be a ``saviangs and loan association''or ``similar institution'' within the meaning of the '33 Act and '34 Act.As a general rule, the SEC has not responded favorably to such arguments.<T3>E.g., Central West End Savings andamp; Loan Association, </T3>'84-85Fed. Sec. L. Rep. (CCH), Para. 77,802 (1984) (securities issued by a pooledfund of tax exempt state and municipal bonds organized and operated byan Sandamp;L as a service to the Sandamp;L's customers do not constitute securitiesissued by an Sandamp;L or ``similar institution''); <T3>Commercial Credit Co., </T3>'71-72 Fed. Sec. L. Rep. (CCH), Para. 78,544(1971) (an industrial loan subsidiary of a thrift institution is not a``similar institution'' and, hence, passbook accounts issued by the subsidiaryare not exempt securities); <T3>Equitable Savings andamp; Loan Association, </T3>'71-72 Fed. Sec. L.Rep. (CCH), Para. 78,721 (1972) (an entity will be deemed to be a savingsand loan association or ``similar institution'' only if it is deemed tobe a thrift institution under applicable financial institutions laws).There is, however, an obvious difference between mutual holding companiesand the entities that were scrutinized in the aforementioned cases: mutualholding companies are chartered under the laws providing for the establishmentof thrift institutions. <T3>See </T3>Item 1 above. Under the principles articulated in <T3>Equitable, </T3>this could be a decisive difference.If the Board were to conclude that the membership interests to be issuedby mutual holding companies are securities under Part I of the definitionset forth above and that such securities should be deemed to be securitiesissued by insured institutions, the Board would, as a third matter, haveto consider whether such membership interests nevertheless qualify forthe exemption set forth in Part II of the above definition for interestsissued in connection with insured deposit accounts. On the one hand, itcould be argued that the rights being received by persons who place depositsin an insured institution subsidiary of a mutual holding company go beyondthe rights received by depositors in a typical insured institution in thatthe rights of the former include, at least in theory, the right to benefitfrom income generated at the holding company level. Thus, it could be arguedthat the normal exemption from Part 563g for rights issued in connectionwith insured deposit accounts should not apply to the interests issuedby mutual holding companies. On the other hand, there would be a certaintension between a conclusion that the rights being issued by mutual holdingcompanies constitute securities issued by an ``insured institution'' (pursuantto the arguments set forth above and in Item 1) and a conclusion that thoserights nevertheless differ in some fundamental respect from the rightsissued to depositors in typical insured institutions, particularly when,as here, the rights issued by the mutual holding company are derived from,and intended to replicate, the interests of accountholders in a mutualinsured institution.Finally, if the Board were to conclude that the membership interests tobe issued by mutual holding companies constitute securities under PartI of the definition set forth above, that such securities should be deemedto be securities issued by insured institutions, and that such securitiesdo not qualify for the exemption set forth in Part II of the above definition,then the Board would, as a fourth matter, have to consider whether suchsecurities are being offered or sold ``for value.'' 12 CFR 563g.1(a)(9)and 563g.2(a). The Board's securities offering regulations, like the '33Act, do not apply to transactions which lack the element of an offer orsale of securities ``for value.'' <T3>See generally, </T3>L. Loss, Fundamentals of Securities Regulation,at 247-248 (2nd ed. 1988). In the context of mutual holding companies,the ``for value'' standard can be argued both ways. On the one hand, itcould be contended that a mutual accountholder gives value when he or she,in effect, exchanges his or her interest in a mutual insured institution,with the potential to undertake a ``standard'' conversion, for an interestin a mutual holding company. On the other hand, it could be argued thatthe interest in the mutual holding company received by the mutual accountholderdiffers in no significant respect from the interest he or she formerlyhad in the mutual insured institution, that the accountholder's formerinterest in the mutual insured institution was not received ``for value,''and that, therefore, no offer or sale ``for value'' could have occurredat the time the accountholder's former interest was exchanged for an interestin the mutual holding company. Further complications, and arguments onboth sides, would appear to be presented in analyzing the interests ofpersons that become accountholders <T3>after </T3>a mutual holding company reorganization.Although none of the cases cited above where courts have considered whetherinterests issued in connection with the establishment of deposit accountsconstitute securities expressly discusses the question of whether suchissuances also constitute offers and sales ``for value,'' the Supreme Courtin <T3>Tcherepnin </T3>appears to have assumed the occurrence of an offerand sale ``for value'' under the circumstances of that case. <T3>Tcherepnin, supra, </T3>at 340-341 and 346.<ITAG tagnum="81">b. Issuance of Debt Securities</ITAG>The analysis of the applicability of 12 CFR Part 563g to the issuance ofdebt securities by mutual holding companies is much simpler than the analysisrequired in connection with membership interests. When a mutual holdingcompany undertakes a traditional debt offering (<T3>i.e., </T3>notes offered to members of the public at a specified priceper note), there will be no question: (i) That ``securities'' are beingoffered; (ii) that the ``securities'' are not being offered in connectionwith insured deposit accounts; and (iii) that offers and sales ``for value''are taking place. The only significant issue that will be presented bythis type of offering is whether the securities are being offered by an``insured institution.'' The arguments for and against viewing a mutualholding company as an ``insured institution'' for securities law purposesare already set forth above in the discussion of membership interests.If, pursuant to these arguments, a mutual holding company is deemed tobe an ``insured institution,'' then the offer and sale of debt securitiesby mutual holding companies will be subject to 12 CFR Part 563g.\2\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ It should be noted that the focus of the above discussionis on whether membership interests and debt securities issued by mutualholding companies should be deemed to be subject to the Board's securitiesoffering regulations. If it is ultimately concluded that mutual holdingcompanies should not be viewed as ``insured institutions'' for securitieslaw purposes, then any debt securities issued by mutual holding companieswill, in the absence of an applicable exemption, be subject to the registrationrequirements of the '33 Act. Moreover, if mutual holding companies arenot properly viewed as ``insured institutions,'' consideration will alsohave to be given to whether membership interests issued by mutual holdingcompanies will be subject to the '33 Act. Any such conclusion would appearto require the following findings: (i) Mutual holding companies are notproperly viewed as ``savings and loan associations'' or ``similar institutions,''(ii) the membership rights issued by mutual holding companies constitute``securities,'' and (iii) such ``securities'' are being offered or sold``for value.''3. Should third parties be permitted to acquire minorityblocks of stock of insured institution subsidiaries of mutual holding companies?NHA section 408(s) does not specify whether third parties, <T3>i.e., </T3>persons or entities other than mutual holding companies,may acquire minority blocks of stock of insured institution subsidiariesof mutual holding companies. In the absence of express guidance from thestatute, arguments can be made on both sides of the issue.On the one hand, it can be argued that the ability to raise capital fromoutside sources is one of the chief benefits that could flow from mutualholding company reorganizations and that, therefore, in the absence ofany express statutory prohibition, the Board should exercise its regulatorydiscretion to permit the practice. This argument is reinforced by the factthat most states that have considered the issue in the context of state-charteredmutual holding companies have opted in favor of permitting third partiesto acquire minority blocks of stock of thrift subsidiaries of mutual holdingcompanies. <T3>E.g., </T3>Connecticut Public Act No. 85-330, sections 4(e) and 5(d);and New Jersey Act No. 2042 (1987), sections 11(b), 20(f), and 31(a).On the other hand, it can be argued that although NHA section 408(s) doesnot expressly prohibit the acquisition of minority blocks of stock by thirdparties, such a prohibition may be inferred from various provisions inthe Section. <T3>See, e.g., </T3>NHA section 408(s)(1)(A) (providing that the stockof the interim insured institution that is formed as a part of the reorganizationprocess to become the operating thrift subsidiary of the mutual holdingcompany must be ``wholly owned'' by the mutual holding company); and NHAsection 408(s)(4) (providing that members of a reorganizing mutual insuredinstitution must possess the same ownership rights at the end of the reorganizationprocess as they possessed at the outset). In addition, it can be notedthat although some states do permit third parties to acquire minority blocksof stock of thrifts owned by state-chartered mutual holding companies,the statutes of those states, unlike NHA section 408(s), contain provisionsexpressly authorizing such acquisitions. <T3>See </T3>state statutory provisions cited above. The absence of anysimilar explicit authorization in section 408(s) could be taken as an indicationthat Congress did not envision that third parties would be permitted toacquire minority blocks of stock of insured institution subsidiaries offederally-chartered mutual holding companies.\3\ \4\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ To date, the Federal Reserve Board has processed one mutualbank holding company application pursuant to CEBA section 107(b) and, inconnection with that application, authorized the subsidiary savings bankof Peoples Mutual Holdings, Bridgeport, Connecticut, to offer minorityblocks of stock to accountholders and the general public. <T3>See </T3>Order of Board of Governors of Federal Reserve Board, Sept.21, 1987. Since the mutual bank holding company provisions applicable toFDIC insured savings banks differ substantially from those applicable toFSLIC insured institutions, the Board does not consider the Federal ReserveBoard's approval of People's application to be precedential for the decisionthe Board must make. <T3>Compare </T3>CEBA section 107(a) <T3>with </T3>CEBA section 107(b).<ITAG tagnum="28">\4\ Legislation has recently been introduced in Congress that wouldamend NHA section 408(s) to specify that third parties may acquire minorityblocks of stock of insured institution subsidiaries of mutual holding companies.S. 2073, 101st Cong., 1st Sess., 134 Cong. Rec. 958-961 (1988).</ITAG>If the Board were to conclude that third parties may acquire minority blocksof stock of insured institution subsidiaries of mutual holding companies,it would also have to consider whether such stock may be in the form ofpreferred stock and/or nonvoting common stock, in addition to ordinarycommon stock. The Board would also have to decide whether acquisitionsof the stock of the insured institution subsidiaries would be limited topurchases of newly-issued stock from the subsidiaries or could also includepurchases of already outstanding stock from the mutual holding companies.\5\<NOTE/> The Board notes that the latter form of acquisition couldconceivably be utilized by mutual holding companies as a way of avoidingrules the Board might adopt limiting the amount of capital that mutualholding companies may derive from their insured institution subsidiaries.<T3>See </T3>Item 6 below. Such acquisitions would also raise difficultquestions regarding the types of procedural safeguards that might be necessaryto protect the rights and interests of the members of the mutual holdingcompany. <T3>See </T3>Item 4 below.   <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ Some state mutual holding company statutes appear to limitthird parties to the purchase of newly-issued stock from subsidiary thrifts(<T3>e.g.</T3>, New Jersey, see above citations), whereas others do not(<T3>e.g.</T3>, Connecticut, see above citations). The legislation referredto in Footnote 4, which would amend NHA section 408(s), would authorizethird parties to purchase, newly-issued stock from subsidiary insured institutions,but not to purchase already outstanding subsidiary stock from mutual holdingcompanies.    4. Should the Board apply comparable procedures to the processof establishing mutual holding companies as now apply to mutual-to-stockconversions?    Because the formation of a mutual holding company would constitute a majorcorporate reorganization, an argument can be made that insured institutionsproposing to form mutual holding companies should be subject to a fullrange of corporate and regulatory procedural safeguards. The Board's regulationsgoverning mutual-to-stock conversions may provide an apt example of thetype of procedures that would be appropriate. Institutions proposing toconvert to the stock form are required, <T3>inter alia</T3>, (i) to submit a conversion application to the FSLICproviding information regarding the proposed plan of conversion; (ii) tosubmit the conversion proposal to shareholders pursuant to a proxy statementthat has been reviewed and approved by the FSLIC and conforms to Form PS,as set forth at 12 CFR 563b.101; and (iii) to comply with other regulatoryprovisions designed to insure that the issuance of stock by the institutionis done in a fair and lawful manner. 12 CFR Part 563b.    Of course, the amount and type of safeguards that will be required willvary significantly depending upon whether third parties are permitted toacquire minority blocks of stock of insured institution subsidiaries ofmutual holding companies. <T3>See </T3>Item 3 above. If the Board were eventually to conclude thatminority blocks of stock may be acquired by third parties, that could arguein favor of mutual holding company reorganizations being treated in a mannersimilar to mutual-to-stock conversions (<T3>e.g.</T3>, subscription offerings, liquidation accounts, dividend limitations,restrictions on the purchase of stock by directors and officers, and soforth). <T3>See </T3>12 CFR 563b.3(c). Consideration would also have to be givento the tax consequences of such acquisitions. <T3>See </T3>sections 368(a)(1)(B) and (c), 382, and 1504(a)(2) of theInternal Revenue Code; and 12 CFR 563b.3(b)(3). The Board would also haveto decide whether to require subsidiary insured institutions of mutualholding companies that sell their stock to third parties (i) to registertheir stock pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 12 U.S.C.78a <T3>et seq.</T3>, regardless of their number of shareholders; (ii) to assista market maker in establishing and maintaining a market in their stock;and (iii) to attempt to list their stock on a national or regional securitiesexchange or on the NASDAQ quotation system. <T3>See </T3>12 CFR 563b.3(c)(19) (which imposes these requirements inconnection with ordinary mutual-to-stock conversions).5. Should mutual holding companies be permitted to acquire control of insuredinstitutions that are already in the stock form and ``other corporations,''as defined below?    As noted above, NHA section 408(s)(5), which specifies the authorized activitiesof mutual holding companies, uses different terminology to describe theauthority of mutual holding companies to engage in transactions with respectto mutual insured institutions and savings and loan holding companies,on the one hand, and stock insured institutions and other corporationsthe capital stock of which is available for purchase by an insured institutionunder federal law or under the law of any state where the subsidiary insuredinstitution or institutions of the mutual holding company have their homeoffices (hereafter, ``Other Corporations''), on the other hand. Clauses(B) and (C) of section 408(s)(5) permit mutual holding companies to ``acquire* * * through merger'' additional mutual insured institutions, and, subjectto certain limitations, to ``merge with'' or ``acquire'' other savingsand loan holding companies. Clauses (A) and (D) thereof permit mutual holdingcompanies to ``invest'' in the stock of insured institutions and otherCorporations.     The Board must determine whether Congess intended any significance to beattributed to this difference in terminology. One way to interpret thedifference would be to conclude that Congress intended to limit mutualholding companies to passive, non-controlling investments in stock insuredinstitutions and Other Corporations. Such an interpretation would be consistentwith the familiar maxim of statutory interpretation that ``where differentlanguage is used in the same connection in different parts of a statute,it is presumed that the legislature intended a different meaning.'' 82C.J.S. ``Statutes'', section 316b (1953). The problem with the foregoinginterpretation is that it would directly contradict NHA section 408(e)(1)(A)(iii),which prohibits non-controlling investments in insured institutions bysavings and loan holding companies. In order to reconcile section 408(s)(5)with section 408(e)(1)(A)(iii), it may, therefore, be necessary to interpretthe term ``invest'' as used in section 408(s)(5), or at least as used inclause (A) thereof, as being synonymous with ``acquire,'' <T3>i.e., </T3>as referring to controlling investments. If the Board concludes that mutual holding companies may acquire controlof insured institutions in the stock form and/or Other Corporations, twoadditional issues will have to be confronted. First, the Board will haveto consider whether stock purchases are the sole form of transaction pursuantto which insured institutions in the stock form and Other Corporationsmay be acquired by mutual holding companies. Although it might be presumedthat mutual holding companies would prefer to structure their acquisitionsof stock institutions and Other Corporations as cash-out mergers, it isnot clear that such mergers would fall within the language of section 408(s)(5)(A) and (D). Second, the Board will have to consider whether the accountholdersof stock institutions acquired by mutual holding companies will be entitledto receive membership rights in the mutual holding company. On the onehand, it could be argued that the issuance of such rights would amountto a windfall for such accountholders at the expense of the existing membersof the mutual holding company since all membership rights that such accountholdersmay have once had in their insured institution as a result of their depositswould already have been exchanged by those accountholders for subscriptionrights and rights inthe institution's liquidation account at the time theinstitution converted to the stock form. On the other hand, it could beargued that attempting to maintain a distinction between accountholderswithin the same mutual holding company structure would be futile and burdensomeand would be inconsistent with the result that would occur in an acquisitionof a stock insured institution by a mutual insured institution in a moretypical transaction. <T3>See, e.g., </T3>12 CFR 552.13(c)(1).6. What standards should guide the Board in reviewing the proposed capitalizationof mutual holding companies? As noted above, NHA section 408(s)(3)(D) provides that an insured institutionthat reorganizes into a mutual holding company ``may, <T3>subject to the approval of the [FSLIC], </T3>retain capital assetsat the holding company level to the extent * * * such capital exceeds''the requirements of 12 CFR 563.13. The highlighted language indicates thatCongress did not intend for section 408(s)(3)(D) to be read as an automaticentitlement for each organizing mutual holding company to retain all assetsin excess of those required for its insured institution subsidiary to meetits regulatory capital requirement, but rather as a statutory floor orirreducible minimum past which the capital of insured institutions maynot fall in the course of a mutual holding company reorganization. Thefact that the statutory language authorizes the FSLIC to review and approveor disapprove capitalization proposals even in those cases where the subsidiaryinsured institution would meet its minimum regulatory capital requirementindicates that Congress intended for the FSLIC to play an active role inassessing the appropriateness of the proposed division of capital in eachmutual holding company reorganization. This conclusion is reinforced bythe fact that the FSLIC is also required to review the specific facts ofeach mutual holding company reorganization proposal and to disapprove anysuch reorganization if the FSLIC concludes that the insured institutionpresenting the proposal does not have adequate financial or managerialresources to support the reorganization or that the reorganization wouldotherwise negatively affect the safety and soundness of the insured institution.NHA section 408(s)(3)(C). Accordingly, the Board is considering what standards should govern itsreview of mutual holding company capitalization proposals. The Board intendsto examine the capitalization issue from both a supervisory perspective(<T3>i.e., </T3>what amount or percentage of capital in excess of the minimumcapital required by regulation may be safely retained at the holding companylevel and what impact will that have on the insured institution's abilityto provide economical home financing?) and from a fairness perspective(<T3>i.e., </T3>should insured institutions that are reorganizing into amutual holding company be able to transfer more capital to their holdingcompanies than insured institutions that are converting to the stock formand simultaneously forming a stock holding company or institutions thatare already in the stock form and elect to form a stock holding company?).With respect to the supervisory point, it should be noted that the Boardrecognizes that well-conceived, prudent attempts to diversify the businessactivities of insured institutions via transfers of capital to their affiliatescan enhance the financial soundness of those institutions and their abilityto compete, but the Board has also found, as a matter of experience, thatinsured institutions with broad diversification authority (<T3>e.g., </T3>state-chartered institutions located in states that providebroad service corporation investment authority) tend to experience a disproportionatelyhigh rate of insolvencies and such insolvencies are frequently due to overlyambitious attempts at diversification.\6\<NOTE/> With respect to the fairness point, it should be noted thattraditionally the Board has restricted the amount of capital that may betransferred to a holding company during the course of a mutual-to-stockconversion. The amount of capital that may be transferred to a holdingcompany formed by an institution already in the stock form has also traditionallybeen limited by various measures tied to the amount of post-conversionnet income that could have, but has not, been paid out as dividends bythe insured institution under Board regulations and policies.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\ The Board also notes that a substantial percentage ofsome insured institutions' regulatory capital consists of goodwill. Inreviewing mutual holding company capitalization proposals, the Board maytake account of the extent to which the capital proposed to be placed insubsidiary insured institutions will be composed of goodwill.7. Shouldmutual holding companies be required to enter into ``net worth maintenance''or ``pre-nuptial'' type agreements with respect to their subsidiary insuredinstitutions?The Board generally conditions any approval of an application to acquirean insured institution upon the acquiror's execution of a ``net worth maintenance''or ``prenuptial'' agreement. <T3>See</T3> 53 FR 31,761 (August 19, 1988). In a ``net worth maintenance''agreement, the acquiror agrees that, at the Board's request, it will infuseadditional equity capital (up to a specified maximum) into the institutionbeing acquired if at any time during the term of the agreement the institutionfails to meet its regulatory capital requirement or the institution's regulatorycapital declines below a predetermined amount. In a ``prenuptial'' agreement,the acquiror agrees that if at any time during the term of the agreementthe acquired institution's regulatory capital declines below a specifiedpercentage of the institution's liabilities or assets, an officer of theFSLIC shall have the right to vote the stock of the institution with respectto certain shareholder matters, including removal and replacement of theboard of directors and sale of the institution.These agreements are required so as to ensure that acquirors will have``sufficient incentive to prudently manage'' acquired institutions andto ``provide the FSLIC with a reasonable amount of protection against adverseevents and uncertainty and time lags inherent in a regulatory capital andaccounting system based on historical costs.'' <T3>Id.</T3> The Board is considering whether, for similar reasons, mutualholding companies should be required to execute ``net worth maintenance''or ``prenuptial'' agreements with respect to their subsidiary insured institutions.8. Should an insured institution that is acquired by an existing mutualholding company be permitted to make a capital contribution to the holdingcompany at the time of the acquisition?Although, as noted above, NHA section 408(s) specifically authorizes anorganizing mutual holding company to retain such capital assets as maybe approved by the Board (within certain limits), there is no indicationwhether Congress intended to permit capital contributions to the holdingcompany by subsequently acquired insured institutions. Such contributionsare rarely, if ever, proposed in connection with acquisitions of insuredinstitutions by stock savings and loan holding companies.Moreover, the Board has traditionally conditioned approvals of acquisitionsof insured institutions by stock holding companies upon agreement by theholding companies that any post-acquisition capital contributions to theholding companies by the acquired institutions (in the form of dividends)will not exceed certain specified levels of the institutions' post-acquisitionnet income. The Board is considering whether this approach should be usedin connection with acquisitions of insured institutions by mutual holdingcompanies.In addition, if the Board concludes that minority blocks of stock of insuredinstitution subsidiaries of mutual holding companies may be acquired bythird parties and if, as would likely be the case, the pool of permissiblethird party acquirors includes directors and officers of the mutual holdingcompanies and their subsidiary insured institutions, the Board will haveto consider whether special rules will be needed to prevent insider abuseof dividends. Because of the absence of shareholders at the holding companylevel to scrutinize the activities of the directors and officers of theholding company, it is conceivable that dividends of the insured institutionsubsidiary could be channeled to insiders of the institution who have becomethe minority shareholders of the institution. This could be accomplished,for example, by (i) causing the insured institution subsidiary to declarelarge dividends; and (ii) causing the holding company to waive its rightto receive such dividends.9. Should mutual holding companies be permitted to pledge the stock oftheir subsidiary insured institutions as collateral to secure notes orother debt instruments of the mutual holding company?The Board is aware that bank holding companies and savings and loan holdingcompanies occassionally raise capital by pledging the stock of their subsidiaryfinancial institutions as collateral to secure borrowings. The Board isconsidering whether mutual holding companies should also be permitted touse this financing technique. Use of this technique by mutual holding companieswould raise novel questions. It is uncertain, for example, what the statusof a mutual holding company would be if the stock of its subsidiary insuredinstitution(s) were seized by a lender upon default on an obligation bythe mutual holding company. Once a mutual holding company is divorced fromits subsidiary insured institution(s), it is unclear whether the mutualholding company would have authority to continue to operate (and, if so,how its membership would be determined) or would be required to liquidateand distribute its remaining assets to its members.One possible solution to the above difficulties would be to prohibit unitarymutual holding companies from pledging the stock of their subsidiary insuredinstitutions, while allowing multiple mutual holding companies to pledgethe stock of all but one of their insured subsidiaries. Alternatively,if the Board concludes that minority blocks of stock of insured institutionsubsidiaries of mutual holding companies can be acquired by third parties,then the above difficulties could also be avoided by providing that eachmutual holding company must, at all times, hold at least 51% of the stockof at least one of its insured institution subsidiaries free of any pledgesor other encumbrances.10. Should mutual holding companies be permitted to terminate their affiliationwith their subsidiary insured institutions and how do mutual holding companiesconvert to stock form?A holding company in the stock form is, of course, able to divest itselfof one or more of its institutions by selling the institution's stock.The Board is considering whether, and under what circumstances, a mutualholding company should be permitted to terminate its affiliation with oneor more of its insured institution subsidiaries. One approach would beto provide that a mutual holding company may terminate its affiliationwith a subsidiary insured institution pursuant to either of two forms oftransaction described below, <T3>provided that </T3>any such transaction is first approved by the holdingcompany's directors and members and by the FSLIC, and <T3>provided that</T3> the holding company, subsequent to the transaction,would still control at least one insured institution. The two forms oftransaction are as follows:<ITAG tagnum="81">a. Transfer from One Mutual Holding Company to Another.</ITAG>In this form of transaction, one mutual holding company would transferall the stock of a subsidiary insured institution to another mutual holdingcompany, with the accountholders of that insured institution receivingownership rights in the acquiring mutual holding company in exchange fortheir former rights in the selling mutual holding company.<ITAG tagnum="81">b. Spin Off of a Free Standing Mutual Insured Institution</ITAG>In this form of transaction, a mutual holding company would be permittedto spin off a subsidiary insured institution in a transaction in whichthe subsidiary insured institution converts back into a free-standing mutualowned by its accountholders.If the Board were to authorize mutual holding companies to engage in theabove types of transactions, it is anticipated that from time to time theBoard might find it necessary to condition its approval of such transactionsupon a pre-transaction capital contribution from the holding company tothe insured institution being disposed of, so as to ensure the capitaladequacy of the institution being disposed of and, perhaps, to ensure thatthe accountholders of that institution would not be stripped of capitalpreviously contributed to the mutual holding company.It is contemplated that a unitary mutual holding company would not be permittedto dispose of its subsidiary insured institution. It appears that the onlyfeasible way for such a company to terminate its mutual holding companystatus would be to convert the mutual holding company to the stock formin a transaction similar to that described in 12 CFR 563b.9, or, in thealternative, to merge the subsidiary insured institution with and intothe mutual holding company in a transaction that would reestablish themutual holding company as a traditional mutual insured institution.If the Board concludes that minority blocks of stock of insured institutionsubsidiaries of mutual holding companies can be acquired by third parties,it will also have to consider how these minority blocks of stock are tobe handled when a mutual holding company elects to convert to the stockform or to merge back into a subsidiary insured institution. <T3>See </T3>previous paragraph. In the context of a conversion, therewould appear to be three options. One option would be to permit the outstandingminority shares of the subsidiary insured institution to be exchanged forshares in the holding company. A second option would be to permit the insuredinstitution to redeem the minority shares as a part of the conversion.Of course, a third option would be to allow the minority shares to remainoutstanding, unaffected by the conversion. 11. Do NHA Section 402(j) and 408(s) preempt state laws providing for,or prohibiting the formation of, mutual holding companies by state-charteredinsured institutions? NHA section 402(j) specifies that ``* * * no insured institution may convertto the stock form except in accordance with the rules and regulations ofthe [FSLIC].'' This language is notable both for what it does and doesnot say. On the one hand, section 402(j) constitutes an affirmative statementthat mutual-to-stock conversions of all insured institutions, includingstate chartered institutions, must comply in all respects with the Board'sconversion regulations. On the other hand, section 402(j) does not saythat conversions of state-chartered insured institutions need comply onlywith the Board's conversion regulations. As crafted, the language seemsto contemplate a dual regulatory scheme in which the conversions of state-charteredinsured institutions must comply with both federal and state law_the practicalresult being that the more restrictive rules govern. This is the positionthat the Board has traditionally taken in its conversion program. The Board is considering how section 402(j) should be read when overlaidagainst state mutual holding company statutes that purport to authorizeinsured institutions, as part of the holding company reorganization process,to issue blocks of stock to persons other than their mutual holding companies.<T3>See </T3>Item 3 above. Such transactions could be characterized aspartial conversions. Since the Board's conversion regulations, 12 CFR 563b,currently do not allow partial conversions, it could be argued that section402(j) prohibits the issuance of minority blocks of stock to third parties,even where state statutes would otherwise permit such issuances, untilsuch time as the Board's regulations may be amended to permit this practice.<T3>See Item </T3>3 above. On the other hand, it could be said that noconversion occurs unless and until the mutual holding company itself convertsto stock form. Section 408(s) presents an even broader preemption question: Should NHAsection 408(s) be deemed to preclude state chartered insured institutionsfrom reorganizing into the mutual holding company form pursuant to statemutual holding company statutes, and, conversely, should NHA section 408(s)be deemed to authorize state-chartered insured institutions to form mutualholding companies under section 408(s) notwithstanding the absence of statelaw authorizing such transactions? The relevant statutory language is asfollows: ``Notwithstanding any provisions of federal law other than thissubchapter, an insured institution operating in mutual form may reorganizeso as to become a holding company by * * * *'' NHA section 408(s)(1). Thislanguage seems to suggest an approach similar to that taken in the Board'sconversion program, <T3>i.e., </T3>state-chartered insured institutions wishing to form mutualholding companies must comply with both state and federal law. Pursuantto this approach, state-chartered insured institutions would have to satisfyall the provisions and restrictions of section 408(s) and the Board's implementingregulations in addition to the relevant laws and regulations promulgatedby their respective states. Under this approach, it would also follow thatsection 408(s) would be insufficient alone to authorize mutual holdingcompany reorganizations by state chartered insured institutions in theabsence of some form of state approval for such transactions.<ITAG tagnum="21">By the Federal Home Loan Bank Board. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">John F.
