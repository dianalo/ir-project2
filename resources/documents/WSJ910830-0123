In its annual report on U.S. utilities, Moody's projected&quot;very limited potential&quot; for credit upgrades for thetwo-thirds of utility firms now rated in the higher-qualitysingle-A and double-A range. The ratings service warned ofdowngrades for those firms that need to boost generatingcapacity and strengthen compliance with new environmentalstandards on power-plant emissions.</LP><TEXT>   Moody's envisioned &quot;continuing fundamental creditimprovement&quot; for the remaining one-third of major utilitycompanies, those now rated in the lower range ofinvestment-grade ratings, Baa.   But overall, Moody's said that the industry's overallcredit quality will remain &quot;basically flat&quot; at its currentmedium investment-grade single-A-3 level over the next threeto five years.   One factor restricting credit prospects for utilities isthe difficulty many face in boosting revenues, the reportsaid. It said that electric rates &quot;are already relativelyhigh,&quot; limiting the prospect of further increases.   The cost of complying with acid rain legislation passed byCongress last year will pose particular credit risks for manyutility firms, Moody's said. Scrubbing devices designed toreduce sulfur dioxide emissions will help companies meet thenew standards, but the equipment is expensive and reducesplant efficiency, the report said.   Utilities that shift to low-sulfur coal to meet thestandards can avoid big capital costs, the report added, butrising demand could boost coal costs and weaken utilitiesthat switch to it.   Meeting increased power demand also will carry creditrisks for the industry, Moody's warned. It cited the expenseutilities face in upgrading old plants, building new ones orcontracting with outside, alternative energy providers.   The report said that operators of nuclear power plants,while largely beyond the &quot;trauma&quot; of staggering constructioncosts that plagued the industry for years, now confrontdifficulties in managing facilities efficiently and safely.Moody's said that operating problems &quot;will certainly havenegative implications for a utility's credit quality.&quot; Othercredit concerns, the report said, include the costs ofdecommissioning plants and waste disposal.</TEXT></DOC>
