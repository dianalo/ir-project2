The rate applies to the first 15,000 miles for cars that aren't fully depreciated. The rate after 15,000 miles of business use for such cars -- and for all business use of cars that are fully depreciated -- remains unchanged at 11 cents a mile.    Taxpayers can deduct either the business standard mileage rate or actual expenses. The business portion of parking fees and tolls is also deductible.    For cars used for charitable activities, the rate remains at 12 cents a mile. For medical and moving expenses, it stays at nine cents. </TEXT></DOC>
