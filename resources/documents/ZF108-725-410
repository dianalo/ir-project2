It has 20 gigabytesof memory divided into &quot;vaults&quot; of 40 disks each.andP;  A vault consists of 32data disks (the 32-bit data word is stored 1-bit/disk), 7 error correctingdisks, and I spare.andM;The configuration can operate at a hardware peak rate of 31 GFlops or asustained rate of 6 GFlops.andM;For text processing, the machine can run the same search program on 64Kdifferent documents at the same time.andP;  (!)andM;The good doctor waltzed us through a sample search.andP;  Each document is brokeninto chunks of 30 words  regardless of sentence or paragraph structure.andP;  Each&quot;word&quot; can be a pair of words that are treated as one (Example: White House).andO;Each chunk is examined for word-search hits and scored.andP;  The chunks are thensorted so the ones with the most hits can be examined first.andP;  (Sounds weird but apparently, it works.)andM;Their system went on-line in January 1989.andP;  It is being used by Dow-Jones andis being sold to their subscribers as the  &quot;Dow Quest System.&quot; They have45,000 subscribers who have access to about 3,000 documents (newspapers,trade press, journals, etc.).andM;&quot;99.9% of all queries are handled in andless; 1.5 seconds.&quot;andM;Because of the parallel architecture of the hardware, the search time is notaffected by the size of the database.andP;  All source documents are searched atthe same time.andP;  Since cost is related to search time, the savings aredramatic ! The system will:andM;* find the  &quot;best&quot; document  - the one with the most hits.andM;* retrieve the document.andM;* find the  &quot;best&quot; segments within the document.andM;If the user wants the system to answer specific questions about the data,&quot;that takes longer.&quot;andM;The technique described for answering questions is not an expert systemtechnique.andP;  It is not rule based.andP;  This system is  &quot;memory based.&quot; The systemexamines the data available in its database (mainly based on word searches).andO;Example: if a medical diagnosis is requested, the system will examine allrelated cases in its database, select those that reference similar symptoms,compare the diagnoses made in those cases, and present the most frequentlyfound one to the user.andP;  No &quot;rules&quot; are used  - just data comparison andstatistical analysis.andM;The company has a similar process that does pattern recognition by comparingthe object item to its stored samples.andM;&quot;Memory-based systems may be more useful than rule based systems.&quot;andM;CAN COMMENT: That is an extremely interesting concept! We plan to keep an eyeon its progress.andP;  There must be a correlation between the size of thedatabase and the correctness of the responses  - implying it is only usefulwith monster-sized data bases.andP;  The concept may have limited use - but itsure sounds like a great idea !andP;  The company is experimenting with scannersso they can build bigger databases faster.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
