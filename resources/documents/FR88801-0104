The NRC staff has prepared an Environmental Assessmentof the Proposed Action, ``Environmental Assessment by the Office of NuclearReactor Regulation Relating to the Expansion of Spent Fuel Pool, FacilityOperating License No. DPR-28, Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corporation,Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Station, Docket No. 50-271.''<ITAG tagnum="84">Summary of Environmental Assessment</ITAG>The Final Generic Environmental Impact Statement (FGEIS) on Handling andStorage of Spent Light Water Power Reactor Fuel (NUREG-0575), Volumes 1-3,concluded that the environmental impact of interim storage of spent fuelwas negligible and the cost of the various alternatives reflected the advantageof continued generation of nuclear power with the accompanying spent fuelstorage. Because of the differences in SEP designs, the FGEIS recommendedevaluating SFP expansions on a case-by-case basis.For the Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Station, the expansion of the storagecapacity of the SFP will not create any significant additional radiologicaleffects or non-radiological environmental impacts.The additional whole body dose that might be received by an individualat the site boundary is less than 0.1 millirem per year; the estimateddose to the population within a 40-mile radius is estimated to be lessthan 0.1 person-rem per year. These doses are small compared to the fluctuationsin the annual dose this population receives from exposure to backgroundradiation. The occupational radiation dose for the proposed operation ofthe expanded spent fuel pool is estimated to be less than one percent ofthe total annual occupational radiation exposure for this facility.The only non-radiological impact affected by the SFP expansion is the wasteheat rejected to the Connecticut River. The increase in total plant wasteheat is less than 0.1%. There is no significant environmental impact attributableto the waste heat from the plan due to this very small increase.<ITAG tagnum="84">Finding of No Significant Impact</ITAG>The staff has reviewed the proposed spent fuel pool expansion to the facilityrelative to the requirements set forth in 10 CFR Part 51. Based on thisassessment, the staff concludes that there are no significant radiologicalor non-radiological impacts associated with the proposed action and thatthe issuance of the proposed amendment to the license will have no significantimpact on the quality of the human environment. Therefore, pursuant to10 CFR 51.31, an environmental impact statement need not be prepared forthis action For further details with respect to this action, see (1) the applicationfor amendment to the Technical Specifications dated April 25, 1986 andadditional information provided by the licensee in letters dated August1, September 26, October 21, November 24, and December 15, 1986, February25 March 19, March 31, April 9, April 13, May 22, June 11, September 1,and December 11, 1987; and March 2 and June 7, 1988; (2) the FGEIS on Handlingand Storage of Spent Light Water Power Reactor Fuel (NUREG-0575); (3) theFinal Environmental Statement for the Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Station,July 1972; and (4) the Environmental Assessment dated July 25, 1988.
