Leaders of the student campaign in Beijing and officials ofindependent labor unions in the capital and Shanghai were incustody, the state-run news said. Other protest leaders were orderedto surrender themselves to police or face ``serious consquences.''   Scores of people also were arrested in the provincial capitals ofJinan, Lanzhou, Chengdu, Xian, Harbin, Shenyang, Changsha andNanjing. Disturbances broke out in all of these cities last week.   The arrests came as authorities intensified a propaganda campaignthat blamed ``troublemakers and counterrevolutionaries'' forconfrontations last weekend in which the People's Liberation Armykilled hundreds of unarmed citizens in Beijing.   The moves were further proof that hardliners, engaged in a powerstruggle with moderates, have gained control of the government. There-emergence Friday of 84-year-old leader Deng Xiaoping with otheraging revolutionaries served to bring the point home.   On Saturday, troop trucks with loudspeakers drove through centralBeijing. ``We love the people, we love the capital,'' they blared.Soldiers in the back of the truck trained their AK-47s on passers-by.   Troops near the bustling Wangfujing intersection detained oneyouth who appeared to be a student. After searching his bags, asoldier pulled him to a military tent pitched nearby. Two othersimilar incidents were witnessed by Associated Press reporters.   The evening television news reported the arrest of 26-year-oldGua Haifeng, a history student from Beijing and a leader of theUnited Association of Beijing Universities. The group led the sevenweeks of pro-democracy protests that preceded last weekend'sviolence.   Authorities said Gua, who had extensive contacts with Westernreporters, was arrested as he attempted to set fire to an armoredpersonnel carrier.   They said he and the labor leaders were being investigated for``counterrevolutionary crimes,'' which carry a sentence of 15 yearsto death.   The same news program broadcast footage from an Americantelevision report in which a middle-aged Chinese man told ofsoldiers gunning down scores of civilians in central Beijing.   An announcer accused the man of ``rumor-mongering,'' a crimeunder martial law regulations in force in Beijing, and urged theaudience to help in his arrest.   Hotlines have been set up in every city district so citizens caninform on ``counterrevolutionaries.'' Beijing Radio said cityofficials had received 167 ``important'' reports by Friday.   A student leader, in an audio recording broadcast on the CBSSaturday Evening News, said that during the crackdown in TienanmenSquare tanks rolled over students and killed them while they sleptin their tents.   ``They thought, at most, that they would be carried away,'' saidthe woman, Cai Ling, through an interpreter. She said she was chiefstudent commander in the square during the violence June 2-4.   Mayor Chen Xitong of Beijing, meanwhile, ordered security forcesto confront anyone found breaking the martial law regulations, ineffect since May 20.   ``Wherever these hoodlums are engaging in illegal activities, thepolice must battle them with the stern fist of the dictatorship ofthe people,'' he said.   He also said that Beijing industries lost about $108 millionduring the first seven days of June. Chen blamed traffic problemsbut wildcat strikes had been widespread.   Chinese media said more than 400 ``scoundrels'' had been put injail for burning military vehicles and beating soldiers during thearmy's invasion of the capital last weekend. On the television news,police were shown interrogating one man at gunpoint.   In Shanghai, about 200 students staged a sit-in to protest thearrest of nine labor leaders. The city government issued a warningsaying there was ``a limit to the restraint of the people ofShanghai.''   More than 150 people had been arrested there, official reportssaid.   Foreigners and those Chinese who could continued their flightfrom the country.   The U.S. Embassy sent a convoy to nearby Tianjin to evacuate 89foreign tourists, students, scholars and oil technicians. Most wereAmericans.   Huang Yasheng, an officer with the World Bank, was among theChinese who fled.   ``The government has gone completely mad,'' he said before hearrived in Hong Kong on Saturday. ``They are living centuries in thepast and refuse to recognize that the world is changing. I wanted tohelp China but I see now that there is no hope.''   Chinese media criticized the Voice of America and U.S. televisionnetworks for their coverage of the violence in Beijing. And thefirst foreign reporter was expelled from the country.   The Xinhua News Agency criticized the VOA for reporting that3,000 people had died and said the network's reports, widely popularin China, were aimed at ``instigating hatred and resistance.''   The Voice of America dismissed the criticism.   ``The VOA checks its information prior to broadcast to be surethe facts are confirmed,'' said a statement released in Washingtonby VOA news director Philomena Jurey.   Peter Newport, a correspondent from the British IndependentTelevision News, was thrown out of Shanghai for ``acting in a wayincompatible with his visa,'' according to ITN in London. NewsEditor Mike Nolan said he did not know what type of visa Newport had.   The campuses in Beijing were mostly empty Saturday. Students whoremained expressed shock at the violence of last weekend.   ``I'm just trying to leave the country,'' said one BeijingUniversity student. ``For more than 2,000 years Chinese have put upwith governments like these. It will take a long time to change.''</TEXT></DOC>
