As East-West tension subsides under the impact of &quot;glasnost&quot; and liberalization in Poland and Hungary, tensions within the Warsaw Pact will continue to grow.    Hungary announced the unilateral &quot;suspension&quot; of its treaty obligation to return East Germans to East Germany, so the exodus, and the diplomatic friction, is bound to continue. Moreover, this is far from the first clash between Hungary and its Warsaw Pact allies since the May 1988 Hungarian Communist Party Congress that set Budapest on the path of liberalization.    Early this year, Hungary joined with Western and other non-Communist governments in calling for an investigation of abuses by the government of Romania. This summer it unilaterally canceled a joint project with Czechoslovakia to build a huge new dam complex on the Danube -- a project vigorously opposed by Hungary's democratic movements for its utter disregard of environmental consequences. In response to the cancellation, the Czech government has threatened to sue.    Last month, when 10,000 Czechs defied their government to commemorate the 1968 Warsaw Pact invasion that ended the liberal regime of Alexander Dubcek, democratic activists from Hungary and Poland joined them. One of the Hungarians managed to videotape the demonstration, and the tape was then broadcast by Hungarian state television. Thus, the many Czechs who receive Hungarian TV signals could see for themselves a different version of the events than their official media were putting out. While the Czech government objected to the Hungarian broadcast, the Hungarian foreign minister warned that Prague's detention of two Hungarians who had taken part in the demonstration would &quot;disturb bilateral relations.&quot;    This was not the first time that Hungarian state television had irked the Czech government. This spring it ran two interviews with Mr. Dubcek despite protests from Prague. Another Hungarian broadcast, an interview with former King Michael of Romania, prompted Bucharest to recall its ambassador. Now that Polish television is scheduled to come under the direction of a non-Communist minister, Czechs should be able to receive many more broadcasts that the Prague authorities will find offensive.    What is true for TV broadcasts will perforce also apply to print media. Already East Germany, like Cuba, has begun banning some Soviet periodicals for their excessive liberalism. What will the East Bloc censors do now that Poland's vast array of independent publications will become legal and above ground?    On the economic front, both Poland and Hungary harbor hopes of making their currencies convertible. This would be a milestone on the path of economic rebirth, but it would complicate and perhaps eviscerate Poland's and Hungary's trade relations within the Eastern Bloc. On the diplomatic front, the two countries are bound to be less observant of bloc discipline in the U.N. and in Helsinki review meetings.    On the ideological front, the new Polish Legislature, with the support of most of its Communist members, has voted to repudiate Poland's participation in the 1968 invasion of Czechoslovakia. Hungarian Communists have done likewise. This leaves the Prague government in the anomalous position of still justifying an invasion of its own country that some of the invaders now call unjustifiable. Even on the military front small rumbles can be heard. An official of the Hungarian Communist Party Central Committee's foreign-policy department raised a ruckus by declaring that the larger threat to Hungary's security comes not from the West but from Romania.    Such military rumblings probably will grow no louder. Eastern European liberalizers, both Communists and democrats, are united in their wish not to arouse security worries in the Kremlin. But the economic, diplomatic and ideological pressures on the non-liberalizing regimes in Eastern Europe are sure to intensify. Communist regimes rely on regimentation and indoctrination. Modern communications technology has proved corrosive of these. The spread of liberalism behind the iron curtain will prove even more so. Now, challenges to control and legitimacy will come not only from the &quot;imperialists&quot; but from within the &quot;socialist camp&quot; itself.    East Germany, Romania and Czechoslovakia increasingly will face a choice.    If they defy the winds of reform, they will have to resist the penetration of their borders by subversive people, publications, broadcasts, and perhaps even technology (like copying machines) not only from the West but from other parts of the East. Their propaganda mills will have to work overtime to rebut the criticism from fellow pact members. And perhaps they will have to stop letting their own citizens travel to those Communist states that will not promise to return them. In short, the iron curtain will be drawn tighter around a radically reduced circumference.    A far happier scenario would show at least one of these hard-line states yielding to the reform current. Given its democratic experience before World War II, as well as Mr. Dubcek's &quot;Prague Spring,&quot; Czechoslovakia would be the most likely candidate. (Strong democratic sentiment exists among the people, but the Communist Party's reformers were rather thoroughly purged after 1968.) If Czechoslovakia were to join the reform camp, it would create a band of liberalizing states across the center of Eastern Europe whose progress would be hard to reverse.    It is hard to say which scenario is more likely. But what seems certain is that if reform continues apace in Hungary and Poland, then the Eastern Bloc will soon learn its own version of a lesson Americans confronted a century ago-that a house divided against itself cannot stand.    ---   Mr. Muravchik is a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute. </TEXT></DOC>
