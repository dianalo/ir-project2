GRAY</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Communist Laos and pro-Western Thailandsay they are fighting a border war to win a remote jungle area theyconsider sacred.   But the conflict that began in November appears to reflectdeeper tensions fueled by centuries of enmity and more recentquarrels related to the flight of refugees, guerrilla warfare andsmugglers' quarrels.   The periodic confrontations on the 1,000-mile frontier aresmaller than the battles being fought on the Thai-Cambodian borderbetween China-supplied Cambodian guerrillas and Soviet-backedVietnamese.   Still, there has been no lack of drama and violence at Thailandborder with Laos. More than 300,000 refugees have fled intoThailand, including thousands of Hmong tribesmen who once foughtfor the United States.   In 1984, Thailand and Laos fought _ on land and in the UnitedNations _ over three border villages. Shootouts along the MekongRiver, which forms much of the boundary line, are common.   In the most recent trouble, which began in November and has beensteadily escalating, the two sides accuse each other of trying tograb a sparsely populated area astride Thailand's Phitsanulokprovince and Sayaboury province in Laos. The Laotians claim 50square miles of disputed territory.   Several hundred troops on both sides have been reported killedand wounded in the fighting, the largest such engagement since theLaotian communists seized power 12 years ago.   Artillery barrages, infantry attacks and the downing of at leastone Thai warplane by a Soviet surface-to-air missile have beendescribed in official accounts by the two countries.   Today, Prime Minister Prem Tinsulanonda announced that a Laotianmilitary team would arrive in Bangkok on Tuesday for talks onending the border battles. But he played down expectations for asolution.   Since the 1975 communist takeover in Laos, both sides have takensome steps toward peaceful coexistence.   In 1979, they pledged to turn the Mekong into ``a river ofgenuine peace.'' But the poorly demarcated river and land boundaryis itself a key source of friction. Both countries pull outconflicting maps, some dating back to the early 1900s, to provetheir claims to disputed territory.   Mutual suspicions are heightened by the activities ofanti-communist Laotian guerrillas.   The Vientiane government claims they operate from Thai soil,drawing recruits from among the 75,000 refugees still in camps nearthe frontier. In turn, Laos provided support for Thailand's nowimpotent communist insurgency.   Lucrative two-way smuggling of items such as water buffalo,marijuana and consumer goods also have led to disputes thatescalated into armed clashes.   Although Thailand denies Laotian accusations that the ongoingfighting was sparked by illegal log poaching by senior Thai armyofficers, cases of corrupt dealings invovling Thai or Laotianofficials have surfaced in the past.   In legal trade, landlocked Laos has tried to decrease its oncenearly total dependence on the Thais for the transit of imports andexports by opening up transport routes to ports in Vietnam. But aquarter of all official imports still pass through Thailand, whichprohibits passage of 61 ``strategic goods'' including bicycles,some medicines and building material.   The list was reduced from more than 200 items a year ago.   MacAllister Brown, a U.S. political scientist, wrote recently:   ``Thailand controls three instruments that can seriously hamperthe development of Laos: the reception of refugees and economicmigrants from Laos, the tolerance of and cooperation with armedresistance elements, and the ban on transit to Laos of `strategicgoods.'''   Although the two countries are very similar in language, cultureand ethnic origin, the Laotians have been controlled by the Thaisand the Vietnamese, from the 15th century until France colonizedthe area in the late 19th century.   Vientiane, a royal capital, was brutally sacked by the Thais in1827.   ``For nearly eight centuries the Thai authorities continuouslypursued an expansionist and hegemonist policy, carried out tens ofatrocious aggressive wars...,'' said a Laotian government positionpaper published in 1984.   In recent decades, Thailand has grown into an economicallystrong nation of 53 million, while colonial repression, war andmismanagement by the communists has relegated Laos, with barelyfour million people, into the ranks of the world's poorestcountries.   These differences tend to increase Laotians' resentment at beingdepicted by the Thais as their ``little brothers.''</TEXT></DOC>
