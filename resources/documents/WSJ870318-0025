Grossman, a New York lawyer, was indicted on 24 felony counts related to an insider-trading scheme he allegedly organized while he was an associate at Kramer, Levin, Nessen, Kamin andamp; Frankel.    Mr. Grossman, 34 years old, was arrested last month on charges that he leaked advanced word of Colt Industries Inc.'s 1986 recapitalization plan to six relatives and friends, helping them make $1.5 million in illegal profits.    The indictment handed up yesterday in Manhattan federal court charges Mr. Grossman with 12 counts of mail fraud and 12 counts of securities fraud. If convicted on all counts, he would face a maximum sentence of 120 years in jail and fines totaling $6 million.    Mr. Grossman, who is to be arraigned on the charges March 26, resigned from the Wall Street law firm Carter, Ledyard andamp; Milburn after his arrest there Feb. 17. He joined Carter Ledyard in October 1986.    Colt's pension-plan trustees had retained Kramer Levin to advise them in connection with the $1.5 billion recapitalization.    The indictment charges Mr. Grossman with mail and securities fraud in connection with 12 purchases of Colt call options by three of the individuals allegedly telephoned by Mr. Grossman: his uncle, George Hirshberg; a cousin, Walter Herzberg; and Norman Stein, whom the Securities and Exchange Commission described as a friend of Mr. Grossman's. The government claims that while Mr. Grossman worked at Kramer Levin he made more than 40 phone calls from his office to his relatives and friends about the Colt plan.    Only Mr. Grossman has been charged criminally in the case. The SEC, in a related civil suit against Mr. Grossman and the six others, claims the group made the $1.5 million on an initial investment of about $33,938.    Mr. Grossman's attorney, Irving Seidman, has declined to comment on the case.    Pending the arraignment, Mr. Grossman, of Brooklyn, remains free on $1 million bond. The government said the case is unrelated to other recent insider-trading cases such as the one involving Ivan F. Boesky. </TEXT></DOC>
