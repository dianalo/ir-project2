(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Eli Bradley Jr. admits he sampled one ortwo grapes at a grocery store. The prosecutor says Bradley ate 2pounds of grapes, and felony charges are being pressed.   Bradley said it was ridiculous to be charged with larceny from abuilding, a felony punishable by up to four years in prison,instead of the lesser charge of shoplifting, which carries a 90-dayjail term.   ``If I'd known, I would've made them take me straight to thehospital and had my stomach pumped,'' said Bradley, 52, of SummitTownship. ``My only proof was in my stomach.''   Bradley was arraigned last week in District Court on the felonycharge. He was released on $10,000 personal bond pendingpreliminary examination April 19.   Bradley had bought $14 worth of fruit, including two bags ofgrapes, and was leaving the store March 4 when a security guardstopped him.   ``They told me to come on back inside and called the police,''Bradley said. ``I told them, `You've got to be kidding me.' Ididn't eat more than one or two. I even offered them a dollar.''   Bradley said the guard might have mistakenly thought he wasconcealing a mouthful of grapes. He said his front teeth had beenknocked out by a cue stick, leaving the exposed nerves sensitive toair.   ``I cover my mouth so the air doesn't hurt, maybe they thought Iwas eating grapes,'' he said.   Bradley said he thought the case was closed after policequestioned him at the scene. But Jackson County Prosecutor JosephFilip later issued a felony warrant for Bradley's arrest.   Filip said although 2 pounds of grapes are worth only about $2,he filed the felony charge because several repeat shoplifters he'sprosecuted have received probation.</TEXT></DOC>
