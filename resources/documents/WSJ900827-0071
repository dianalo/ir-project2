At atime when the maintenance of order under Pax Americana wasthe rule of the game, the order in the system was maintainedprimarily through the leadership of the United States. Insuch a situation, in both the political and the economicdomains, the United States tended to practice what might betermed as `unilateral globalism.' The United States was ineffect managing the international system through maintaininga universally acceptable order through unilateral leadership.With the arrival of diffusion of power, however, that is nolonger possible.&quot;   -- Hisashi Owada, deputy foreign minister of Japan, in aspeech delivered at the Seventh International LisbonConference on European Security in a Multipolar World, Nov.8, 1989.                                                                                                       </LP><TEXT>   Oh well, we all make mistakes, especially when we peerinto the future. How could the thoughtful and able Mr. Owadahave foreseen that just nine months after his speech, theworld would again be relying on Pax Americana to get itselfout of a jam? When Iraq's Saddam Hussein grabbed Kuwait andmenaced Saudi Arabia, seeking effective control over 40% ofthe West's oil supply, there was little question about whowould exercise unilateral leadership. It had to be GeorgeBush, President of the United States.   I cite Mr. Owada's words not to embarrass him or toreassert U.S. global hegemony, but to make another point:News of the demise of military power as a factor in globalpolitics was decidedly premature. Mr. Owada certainly was notthe only one mistaken. The idea had become quite fashionablethat economic power, not military might, would be the mostimportant way of wielding global influence in the enlightened1990s. Up until Aug. 2.   That thesis had accorded Japan a major world role simplybecause of the success of its corporations in operating on aglobal scale. Toyota, Sony and all those other familiarJapanese brand names have penetrated deeply into marketseverywhere. Dollars have piled up for the Bank of Japan andin private accounts at a phenomenal rate. That wealth hasbeen reinvested in real assets around the globe, earningJapan admiration but also resentment in some places, the U.S.in particular.   But now the Persian Gulf conflict has sharply boosted theprice of oil, an import vital to Japan's awesome industrialmachine. But Japan, that putative world power, has beenmainly on the sidelines. At the urging of George Bush, PrimeMinister Toshiki Kaifu signed on to the UN embargo ofIraqi-Kuwaiti oil. That was an advance from the 1979 U.S.-ECembargo against Iran during the hostage crisis, when Japanonly provided some lip service. But the U.S. is pressingJapan to do much more. Pressure will rise after Congressreturns from recess.   Japan was getting some 12% of its oil from Iraq andKuwait. It could be argued that using Japanese self-defenseforces to safeguard those supplies might be legitimate underJapan's legal ban on their use for offensive purposes. Its120-odd F-15s are primarily air superiority fighters, moreadapted to defensive use than attack. Its 57 frigates alsoare primarily defensive, useful for protecting carriers andother vessels against air or naval attack. Japan surely willoffer financial aid, but direct intervention is being debatedintensely in Tokyo.   Japan bashers in the United States and Europe, with alarge head of resentment steam already, quite likely willfind cause for further bashing. But there will be someambivalence. Do those who still are suspicious of Japan,nearly 50 years after Pearl Harbor and the Japanese conquestof British and French holdings in Southeast Asia, want Japanto become a global military power as well as an economictitan? Do they really want Japan to slip the ties of itssecurity treaty with the U.S.? In short, do they really wantthe end of Pax Americana to become a reality, with globalpolitical power as well as economic power widely dispersed?That would mean a genuine &quot;triad,&quot; three independentlypowerful blocs, the U.S., Japan and a Europe dominated by yetanother economic powerhouse, Germany. The Soviet Union, ofcourse, remains a major military power as well, despite itstroubles.   Clearly, Bush administration officials have thought aboutthis. In June, the U.S. had a key role in organizing a NorthAtlantic Treaty Organization meeting in Knokke, Belgium, witha special objective. It aimed at pulling Japan and NATOtogether into a closer global security alliance. The themewas, &quot;North American, European and Japanese Interdependencein the 1990s.&quot;   It was almost as if the U.S. and NATO had anticipatedSaddam Hussein. But he struck well before anything resemblingan effective working alliance had been formed to deal withsuch problems as the Kuwait grab. NATO had traditionallyshunned what it called &quot;out-of-area&quot; involvements, despitelongstanding U.S. urging that Europe take a broader view.Similarly, Japan had been reluctant to involve itself outsidea perimeter surrounding its own islands, although it hasenlarged that perimeter.   Yet Paul Wolfowitz, U.S. undersecretary of defense forpolicy, could do some cheerleading to the Knokke gathering.He said that the coalition had in fact made progress inpulling together for the defense of the Persian Gulf, an areawith threequarters of the world's proven oil reserves. Citingthe effort to protect shipping in the Gulf during theIran-Iraq war -- an endeavor dubbed Operation Earnest by theU.S. -- Mr. Wolfowitz said the U.S. had provided &quot;carrier andconventional naval forces. Our European allies, operatingunder the umbrella of the Western European Union, providednaval forces and particularly minesweepers. And Japanprovided financial resources.&quot;   Well, financial resources are not nothing. Japan hasgranted significant aid to Egypt, Pakistan and Turkey, allthree of which quickly allied themselves with the U.S. in theeffort to bring down Hussein. Japan will get U.S. pressure toprovide still more financial support to help maintainmilitary forces in the Gulf region.   Yet some experts think Japan has little choice but tobecome more engaged in the world's military problems as well.That was the view of Fred Ikle, undersecretary of defense forpolicy in the Reagan administration, and Terumasa Nakanishiof the Research Institute for Peace and Security in Tokyo, ina provocative article in the summer issue of Foreign Affairs.&quot;It seems unlikely that Japan's body politic would remaincontent through the end of this decade to see the nation amere bystander on matters that affect the strategic order ofthe world,&quot; they wrote. Well, Mr. Owada was premature, andthese two intelligent men may be as well. We will know moreafter events in the Gulf play themselves out.</TEXT></DOC>
