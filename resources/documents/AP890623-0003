The court ruled 5-4 to uphold Virginia officials who said forcingstates to pay for second-round appeals could lead to long delays inexecuting inmates.   When inmates file a first appeal in state courts, lawyers areprovided by the state.   If that fails, inmates can pursue a second round of appeals. Likeother states, Virginia provides prison law libraries and assignspart-time lawyers to help all inmates prepare their second-round _or collateral _ appeals. In some cases, volunteer lawyers areavailable.   Death row inmates who lose a second time may then shift tofederal courts, but legal help in those appeals was not at issue inFriday's case.   In writing the majority opinion,, Chief Justice William H.Rehnquist said convicts' constitutional rights are not violated bycutting off free access to lawyers.   ``The additional safeguards imposed by the (Constitution) at thetrial stage of a capital case are, we think, sufficient to assurethe reliability of the process by which the death penality isimposed,`` Rehnquist said.   Rehnquist was joined by Justices Byron R. White, Sandra DayO'Connor and Antonin Scalia.   Justice Anthony M. Kennedy supplied the fifth vote to overturn afederal appeals court ruling that said condemned killers in Virginiawho cannot afford a lawyer are entitled to greater representation attaxpayer expense than the state provides.   In a separate concurring opinion, Kennedy agreed with the resultreached by the other four but on narrower grounds.   In a dissenting opinion, Justice John Paul Stevens said theruling violates ``simple fairness'' for death row inmates. He wasjoined by Justices William J. Brennan, Thurgood Marshall and HarryA. Blackmun.   The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled a year ago theConstitution requires special legal help for death row appealsbecause of their complexity.   Twenty states joined in support of Virginia. They are Florida,Georgia, Mississippi, North Carolina, Missouri, South Dakota,Wyoming, Delaware, California, Pennsylvania, New Mexico, Indiana,Kentucky, New Hampshire, Nevada, Utah, South Carolina, Oregon,Maryland and Idaho.</TEXT></DOC>
