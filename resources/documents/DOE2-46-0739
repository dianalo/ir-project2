To that effect, purpose-tested processcomputers should be used for continuous recording of pollutant emission.Minimum demands to be made on these process computers are laid down inguidelines (ordinance on industrial furnaces, clean-air code). The processunits can also execute certain additional functions beyond the specificones. Via a computer interface, larger computers have access to the dataof the process unit for further processing.</TEXT></DOC>
