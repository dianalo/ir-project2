(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The United Mine Workers and The Pittston Co.agreed today to resume contract talks under supervision of amediator in an effort to end a bitter strike that has idledthousands of coal miners in several states.   UMW President Richard Trumka and Pittston Vice President JosephFarrell signed an agreement to hold negotiations Wednesday morningfor the first time since June 8.   Under the agreement, a federal mediator will meet with each sideseparately and deliver proposals to the other party.   The agreement also said Pittston can continue to claim that talksare at an impasse, and the union can still claim that Pittston hasfailed to bargain in good faith.   The agreement was a result of a four-hour meeting with U.S.District Judge Glenn Williams.   In the coal fields, more than 4,000 UMW miners failed to reportfor work at Alabama's two largest coal companies today, a day afterthey ended a four-week walkout. But a union official told them to goback for tonight's shift.   Trumka was joined at the meeting by UMW Vice President CecilRoberts, District 28 President Jackie Stump, and Judith Scott andMichael Buckner from the union's headquarters in Washington.   Joining Odom at the table was Joseph Farrell, vice president forThe Pittston Co., the coal group's parent company.   The walkout at Pittston, one of the few coal companies not tosign a UMW contract last year, led to unauthorized sympathy walkoutsbeginning last month that affected up to 46,000 miners in 10 states.   Most of those miners have since gone back to work, but wildcatstrikes still affect several thousand miners in West Virginia, andtwo mining companies in Alabama reported that about 4,000 minersfailed to show up this morning. A union official told them to goback for tonight's shift.   Negotiations between the two sides broke down June 8. Thegovernors of Virginia and West Virginia had issued similar offers tomediate talks, but Pittston officials had declined them.   About 1,900 UMW members are striking Pittston in a dispute overbenefits and job security issues. The strike began April 5 inVirginia and West Virginia before spreading to Kentucky. Hundreds ofminers have been arrested for a variety of violent incidents as wellas civil disobedience tactics.   Federal statistics released Friday gave an indication of howwildcat strikes that began June 12 are affecting coal production.   The data showed that during the third week of the walkout, coalproduction had dropped by 57 percent in the eastern half of thecountry and 42 percent nationally, compared with pre-strike levels.   Some miners in southern West Virginia remained on wildcat strikestoday, awaiting the outcome of today's meeting. Trumka last Fridayasked the wildcat strikers to return to work, and most appeared tobe doing so on Monday.   ``It was time to come back,'' said Ron Airhart, president of UMWLocal 1412 at Keystone Coal Mining Corp in Indiana County, Pa.   ``We made an important statement. We got the country's attention.Now we'll get to work again and hope we've made a difference.''   ``They have a full complement of people out there today andeverything seems to have started up very well,'' said Carl Heldt,director of human resources for Old Ben Coal Co. in Oakland City,Ind.   ``They're in good spirits. I've been told by the mine managementthat people seemed delighted and eager to be there. They've beenwithout paychecks for about a month.''   In West Virginia, pickets continued to idle mines.   ``There were pickets out there today, scattered all over thehighway,'' said Fred Jarrell, president of Local 1330 atConsolidation Coal Co.'s Rowland Mine in Raleigh County, about 60miles southeast of Charleston.   ``I stood up there yesterday and preached for two hours tellingpeople to go back to work. I don't think it did any good.''   Some scattered violence was reported Monday in southern WestVirginia, with coal trucks serving non-union Elk Run Coal Co. inBoone County hit by rocks and other projectiles.   Mark Polen, vice president of the West Virginia Coal Association,blamed a ``radical minority'' within the union for keeping the minesidle, primarily in Charleston-based District 17, whose 8,000 workingmembers are among the most militant in the nation.   ``District 17 is the root, as usual, of the problems,'' Polensaid.   Some 200 Island Creek Coal Co. workers also were off the job inwestern Kentucky on Monday evening, company spokeswoman Julie Accolasaid. She did not immediately return a telephone call this morningon whether they returned today.   In Alabama, 4,000 miners failed to report for work at the state'stwo largest coal companies, Jim Walter Resources and the DrummondCo., just one day after they ended a four-week wildcat walkout,company officials said today. Union officials declined to comment onreports that the walkout stemmed from the firing of several miners.</TEXT></DOC>
