We cannot, we must not, forgetthis. And we should not give in to the temptation to transmute asmall difference in a historic relationship into a majordisagreement that might end up damaging the greatest foreign-policysuccess of the post-war era.   I believe we can and will make progress on these matters as longas we hold true to our principles and do not give up the battle.   Now, I would like to ask those of you in this room who consideryourselves foreign policy skeptics to do me one last favor. I wantto ask you to remain vigilant.   You are the people who play the vital role of remindingpoliticians and policy-makers of many important and necessary truthswe sometimes forget.   It's true that sometimes you can't see the forest for the trees;indeed, sometimes you can't even see the trees for the grass thatsurrounds them.   So please, for George Bush's sake and for the sake of all we holddear, please keep watching the forest.   I take my leave of you now by offering a final prayer that Godmay bless and keep all of you all the days of your life. Thank youand good night. (Applause.)      END OF TEXT, 4 Takes</TEXT></DOC>
