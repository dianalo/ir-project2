At present, development surveys by developers in the civilsector are in progress in five regions in Oita Prefecture. 1) TakigamiRegion: As the first stage development project, the preparation of theconstruction of a power station with the power generating capacity of15,000-20,000KW is under way with the aim to start its operation in 1989.2) Tano Region: Since 1981, five geothermal wells, 300-500m deep each,were drilled and the survey has been in progress. 3) Yufuin Region: Since1980, the survey and analysis have been under way on geological features,soil temperature, geochemistry, and electricity, etc. 4) Hacchobaru Region:With the aim of starting its operation in 1989, No.2 geothermal powerunit with power output of 55,000KW is being planned as an additionalinstallation. 5) Noya Region: The survey started in 1982. At presentthe results of the surveys on radioactivity, geochemistry, MT, electricity,and earthquakes are being analyzed. (24 figs, 12 tabs)</TEXT></DOC>
