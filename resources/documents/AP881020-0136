(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Vice President George Bush today warnedagainst relaxing U.S. military strength in the face of peacegestures from the Soviet Union and said the nation can ill affordto elect rival Michael Dukakis, who he said has ``literally noexperience in foreign affairs.''   The Republican presidential candidate, addressing 600 supportersin a Knights of Columbus hall here in central New Jersey beforeheading to Queens, N.Y., to accept the backing of New York Citypolice, accused the Massachusetts governor of opposing the U.S.invasion of Grenada, the strike against Libya and its policy in thePersian Gulf to protect the flow of oil there.   ``I believe that we've got to fight terrorism and if we everagain face clear evidence of terrorist aggression, terroristinvolvement in the taking of American lives, as we did in the caseof Libya, I would not hesitate to strike again,'' Bush said. ``Wehave got to punish state-sponsored terrorism.''   Bush and Dukakis were appearing on the same stage later tonightwhen they address a Catholic charities dinner in New York City.   Taking note of the changing colors of the autumn foliage, Bushsaid, ``The leadership of the Soviet Union is changing ... but oldambitions die hard. Systems die hard. And the leaves may befalling, but the trees are fundamentally the same.   ``As much as we welcome the change in the Soviet Union, now isnot the time to abandon realism about what makes the Soviet Unionmove,'' he said.   ``Those who want to abandon the policy of peace through strengthin the hopes of self-induced Soviet restraint are dead wrong,'' hesaid. He criticized Dukakis for opposing the mobile MX andMidgetman missiles, but insisting he wants to modernize theland-based U.S. strategic force.   ``He doesn't understand that we can't give away our best cardsand then sit down and expect to negotiate a fair treaty with theSoviets,'' Bush said.   ``I don't think we should risk turning over the leadership andsecurity of this free world of ours to a man...with literally noexperience in foreign affairs.''   Bush was trolling for votes in New York, where polls show himwithin striking distance of Dukakis.   ``We think if we can win New York, we totally destroy hisability to win the election,'' campaign manager Lee Atwater toldreporters on the campaign trail Wednesday in Michigan.   Bush and his aides continued to insist there is to be noshifting of gears or lessening of campaign efforts because of hisstrength in opinion polls. Atwater said Bush would spend 80 percentof his time in Dukakis' ``must win'' states, but he declined toname them, other than New York.   However, the campaign aide said the key states of the rest ofthe campaign, in addition to Michigan and New Jersey, are Illinois,Ohio and California.   Internal campaign polling shows Bush one or two points behindDukakis in New York, a state Democrats usually count on for itsrich prize of 36 electoral votes, Atwater said.   Bush told reporters he was encouraged by a new Field pollshowing a 50 percent to 41 percent lead over Dukakis in California,but that the poll reflects a more positive position for him thanhis campaign's internal polls.   A campaign source said internal polling shows Bush with asix-point lead in California. The Field poll had a margin of errorof 4.7 percent.   Next week, Bush and President Reagan will appear together at agala campaign event in Los Angeles.   The California strategy also includes saturation use ofcommercials attacking Dukakis, because the glut of ads for stateballot initiatives dilutes the effect of the ads if they don't runlong enough, Atwater said.   In a speech at the University of Michigan on Wednesday, Bushsaid he wants a renewed bipartisan approach to U.S. foreign affairs.   Although he frequently blasts the Democratic-controlled Congressas the perpetrator of poor policy, Bush said he wantsbipartisanship to be ``once more the vibrant heart of a foreignpolicy that is decided by a debate which ends at the water's edge.''   But he did not hesitate to deride his Democratic opponent in thesame speech.   ``Lacking foreign policy experience, he has a rather unrealisticview of America's role and the way in which we lead,'' Bush said.   Bush also said that if elected, he would convene a summit ofNATO allies to consider future use of the allied forces, with aneye toward budget-restraint and burden-sharing.   Asked later if he would stop criticizing Congress in theinterest of bipartisanship, Bush said: ``No, I'm going to keep thepressure on and get them to work in a bipartisan spirit with thenext president. It's very important.''</TEXT></DOC>
