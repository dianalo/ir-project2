The House already has approved the plan for the federalgovernment to pick up the tab for the extra officers.   By Thursday, 229 people had been killed in the district thisyear, compared with 159 at the same time in 1988. A record 372people were killed last year.   Police blame more than 60 percent of the slayings on drugs.   Before the Governmental Affairs committee approved the five-yearplan, Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., said he might introduce an amendmentrequiring the city to pay for part of the program.   The city already has agreed to pay about $2 million in recruitingand training costs.   However, Levin may drop plans to have the city pay for theofficers if he's convinced the district is also making efforts tohire police, said Levin aide Linda Gustitus.   The city is adding 200 officers in the current fiscal year, while300 more are to be hired in the fiscal year that starts Oct. 1.   The panel also approved an amendment by Sen. Jon Heinz, R-Pa.,that requires the city to share routine arrest information and otherpolice data with the FBI and other federal law enforcement groups.   Because of a 1968 law establishing a balance of power between thefederal and local police departments, the district is the onlyjurisdiction in the nation not to share such information.</TEXT></DOC>
