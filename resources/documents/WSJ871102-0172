The association alleged in a lawsuit that a planned special issue of Maclean's magazine devoted to the 1988 Winter Olympics would improperly use Olympic trademarks that include the words &quot;Winter Olympics.&quot; It said Time Inc., a New York-based publishing and cable concern, has the exclusive right to use those trademarks in special issues.    The phrase &quot;Winter Olympics&quot; is the only item protected by a trademark that is mentioned in the suit. It is among more than 200 words, phrases and symbols for which the association has gained trademark protection in Canada. A spokesman for the U.S. Olympic Committee said most such words and symbols are similarly protected in the U.S.    The suit was filed against Toronto-based Maclean-Hunter Ltd., which publishes Maclean's and other publications. Kevin Doyle, editor of Maclean's, said he expects the company to oppose the suit. He described it as &quot;an unprecedented infringement on freedom of the press.&quot;    Mr. Doyle said the special issue will be published in addition to the regular weekly editions of Maclean's and will be sold starting around mid-January, while the Winter Games are being held in Calgary, Alberta.    &quot;The issue here isn't freedom of the press,&quot; said David Shanks, general manager, corporate relations, for XV Olympic Winter Games Organizing Committee, which also is a plaintiff in the suit. He said Maclean's is welcome to write about the Winter Olympics in a &quot;normal editorial fashion in its year-around 52 issues.&quot;    The suit alleges that Maclean-Hunter isn't &quot;merely reporting&quot; on the Winter Olympics but using &quot;official marks in a commercial manner to associate itself&quot; with the Games. It says Maclean's magazine offers free copies of the special issue as an inducement to new subscribers and offers discounts to advertisers in the special issue who also buy space in regular issues that contain Olympic coverage.    Mr. Shanks said Time had &quot;expressed some concern&quot; about the planned Maclean's issue but said that wasn't the reason for the suit. The suit says Time, along with its exclusive right to produce special Olympic issues, has rights to publish the official souvenir program and &quot;generally to promote its publications in conjunction with&quot; the Winter Games.    A spokesman for Time said, &quot;We don't have anything to do with the suit.&quot; He said Time's rights apply to &quot;advertising, promotional and merchandising efforts.&quot;    Robert Bruser, a partner who specializes in media law at the Toronto firm of Blake Cassels andamp; Graydon, said he doesn't know of any previous lawsuit in Canada seeking to ban a publication on grounds similar to those cited by the Olympic authorities. </TEXT></DOC>
