REID</BYLINE><BYLINE>Assocated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   At least 20 government soldiers werekilled in clashes with communist rebels, and an aide to PresidentCorazon Aquino said she will not extend an amnesty for communistand Moslem rebels.   Mrs. Aquino first made the controversial amnesty offer inFebruary 1987 following the breakdown of peace talks with thecommunist-dominated National Democratic Front. She extended it foranother six months the following August.   An official at the presidential palace, speaking on condition ofanonymity, said the program administered by the National EconomicDevelopment Authority would expire on schedule tonight at midnight.   ``Rebels who will come down from the hills starting tomorrowwill be charged in court for crimes they committed,'' he said.   The official added that rebels who had already surrendered willcontinue to receive government assistance.   The military had been unenthusiastic about the program becausesenior officers complained it enabled rebels to avoid prosecutionfor killing soldiers. Military dissidents arrested after previouscoup attempts also complained that they should be granted the sameamnesty as the rebels.   Officials at the National Economic Development Authority claimnearly 60,000 people, mostly communist rebels or their supporters,surrendered under the amnesty program. But the authority admittedthat only 6,252 were regulars of the 23,000-strong communist NewPeople's Army.   Critics of the program believe those figures are inflated.Journalists who attended several mass surrender ceremonies foundthat many of those claiming to be rebels or their supporters weresimply impoverished peasants seeking government handouts or tryingto avoid military attacks on their villages.   As the deadline approached, it appeared the communists weregearing up for a new round of fighting. At least 20 soldiers werekilled in scattered battles with the rebels over the weekend.   The rebels on Sunday stormed a Philippine Constabularyheadquarters on Negros island, killing six government troopers andlooting the garrison of its weapons, the military said today.   On Saturday, 12 elite Scout Rangers died when their truck ranover a land mine between Guinobatan and Jovellar towns in Albayprovince, 200 miles southeast of Manila.   Troops killed four ebels in the ensuing gun battle, the militarysaid.   Elsewhere, rebels killed two Philippine Constabulary sergeantsin Leyte province Saturday and soldiers killed two rebels in Boholprovince, according to military reports.</TEXT></DOC>
