That's easy.Just peek at the company's proxy statement and you'll findthe dollar amount of his salary plus bonus.   Want to know how that compensation was computed? That'sanother story -- and a complicated one.</LP><TEXT>   But why should you care anyway? Because that's one waythat you as a shareholder can find out whether the company istoo generous with its top brass.   To figure out the computation, you first have to find theformula the company uses for incentive pay. Only a fewcompanies give enough details to do that. These include WaltDisney Co., with a formula of 2% of the amount by which netincome exceeds 9% of stockholders' equity; Toys &quot;R&quot; Us Inc.,1% of pretax profit above $18 million; and ReebokInternational Ltd., 5% of pretax profit above $20 million.Each of these formulas is for the company's chief executiveofficer.   But most companies don't give enough specifics to make thecalculation. Typical is Limited Inc., which in its 1988 proxysays the executive-compensation plan &quot;awards bonuses todesignated executives and employees of the company if theirperformance or that of the company meets specified goals.&quot;The big retailer, based in Columbus, Ohio, doesn't give itsstockholders the faintest clue as to how it computed the$1,030,753 cash compensation of chairman and president LeslieH. Wexner in 1988. Asked why Limited doesn't disclose anexecutive-compensation formula in its annual proxy, AlfredDietzel, vice president-financial, declined comment.   A company doesn't have to disclose the compensationformula under Securities and Exchange Commission rules. &quot;Apublic company only has to report the dollar compensation ofthe five highest-paid executives,&quot; says an SEC spokesman.   But many experts think that holders have a right to knowthe formula. &quot;It should be an open compact between thecompany and the shareholders dividing the spoils,&quot; says GraefCrystal, a compensation specialist and adjunct professor ofbusiness administration at the Haas School of Business,University of California at Berkeley. &quot;The fact that manychief executives are loath to disclose their outdatedincentive formulas shows they have sound survival instincts.&quot;Adds Peter Chingos, national director ofexecutive-compensation consulting for Peat Marwick, a majoraccounting firm: &quot;The formula shows whether top management'scompensation properly reflects profits and measures upagainst a reasonable return for shareholders.&quot;   Compensation specialists say the formulas help directorsmeasure executives' performance against the passiveinvestment of equity at current market yields. Under manyformulas, executives are paid from profits after deductingthat yield. Thus, to get a bonus, top executives must showthey outperformed simply investing stockholders' equity infixed-income securities. (In simplest terms, stockholders'equity is total assets minus total liabilities.)   Here's how a typical formula works: Company A pays itsexecutives from an incentive pool, which represents 5% of netincome that tops an 8% return on equity. This is known as afive-over-eight formula.   Say the company reported $500 million in annual profit,which met targeted goals of the board. Shareholders' equityamounted to $2 billion. So Company A's total incentive poolfor top executives amounts to $17 million -- 5% of $340million ($500 million of profits minus $160 million, or 8% of$2 billion in equity).   In Company A, executives are paid a bonus geared to apercentage of their annual salary. The higher an executive'srank, the higher the percentage. The chief executive officermay get 50% to 100% of his salary as a bonus from the pool,depending on his performance. The chief operating officer mayreceive from 45% to 90% of his salary; the chief financialofficer, 40% to 80%; and lower-level executives, 30% to 60%.   Thus, the chief executive, who gets a salary of $1million, could get $500,000 to $1 million as a bonus. Thechief operating officer, who earns $750,000, could get abonus of $337,500 to $675,000; the chief financial officer,who earns $500,000, a bonus of $200,000 to $400,000. Thesepercentages aren't disclosed in corporate proxies beyond anoccasional reference that bonuses can't exceed a certainpercentage of salary.   Let's look at companies that provide full disclosure intheir latest proxies. At Walt Disney, Toys &quot;R&quot; Us and Reebok,the chief executives alone are compensated based on a singleformula. Disney Chairman Michael Eisner, who is paid a bonusbased on a two-over-nine formula (changing to two over 11after 1990), received a bonus of $8.8 million for the fiscalyear ended last Sept. 30, up from $6.7 million the previousyear. His annual base salary is $750,000.   Charles Lazarus, chairman of Toys &quot;R&quot; Us, got an annualbase salary of $315,000 with a bonus of $4.1 million for theyear ended Jan. 31, 1989. The bonus is 1% of annual pretaxprofit that exceeds $18 million. And Reebok Chairman PaulFireman, who receives an annual salary of $350,000, got abonus of $11 million for 1988; his bonus is 5% of annualpretax profit above $20 million.   But at Paramount Communications Inc., no formula isspecified. Chairman Martin Davis, who got a 1988 salary andbonus of $3.67 million, is paid his bonus based on the&quot;extent to which performance targets set by committee areachieved,&quot; according to the company's proxy. P. Roy Vagelos,chairman of Merck andamp; Co., got a salary and bonus of $1.6million in 1988. His bonus was awarded &quot;in such amounts as {acompensation} committee determines but it cannot exceed 12%of `incentive earnings' as defined in Merck's compensationplan.&quot; There's no way to compute the formula.   That, however, may not matter too much longer becausecompensation consultants say that the formula may one daybecome passe. That's probably either because it reveals toomuch or because companies ignore it anyway if it proves to bea bar to bonuses. Many boards are deciding to drop it andsubstitute more subjective criteria.   For example, J.P. Morgan andamp; Co., the big bank holdingcompany that operates Morgan Guaranty Trust Co. of New York,has been paying its top executives from a pool consisting ofnet income that exceeds 8% of stockholders' equity. During1987, Morgan added $875 million to its allowance for creditlosses, mainly to reserves for questionable loans overseas.This wiped out executive bonuses under the formula. So theboard ignored the formula and gave Morgan executives bonusesanyway.   Lewis T. Preston, who stepped down as Morgan chairman inJanuary, got $641,667 in salary and a discretionary $600,000bonus for 1987. For 1988, Mr. Preston received a total of$1.8 million in cash compensation under the formula. Thesalary and the bonus weren't disclosed separately.   Edmund Rogers, Morgan's senior vice president and residentcounsel, declines to give the formula that shows how the poolis distributed to senior executives. &quot;We don't disclose itbecause we don't think it's meaningful,&quot; he says. &quot;We'rerequired to provide the total dollar compensation for eachtop executive, but we've decided not to disclose the bonusalone because we feel it's competitive information.&quot;   When Morgan issued its proxy last month, shareholders sawMr. Preston's total cash compensation, which included a bonusfor 1989 despite a $2 billion increase in the bank'sforeign-loan reserves during the year. &quot;We'll bediscontinuing the formula for senior officers,&quot; Mr. Rogerssays, &quot;and the bonus will henceforth be included in thegeneral incentive compensation plan, based on performance andat the discretion of the board.&quot;   &quot;The trend is away from fixed formulas to goal-attainmentincentives,&quot; says Mr. Chingos, the Peat Marwick consultant.&quot;Under these incentives, executives are paid bonuses based ontheir meeting certain performance goals, such as return oninvestment or cash flow.&quot; The SEC doesn't require these goalsto be disclosed, he notes, so the shareholder will see onlythe total cash compensation in the proxy.   ---   Mr. Berton is a staff reporter in The Wall StreetJournal's New York bureau.   ---                    Olympic-Size Pools                                                                                                       executive compensation pools.
