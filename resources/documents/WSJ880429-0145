A year ago, The Wall Street Journal brought together two separate groups of Canton voters, one Republican and one Democratic, to discuss the 1988 presidential race. At the time, many of these people expressed serious qualms about the quality of the candidates -- including Vice President George Bush and Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, the two who have emerged as their parties' probable standard-bearers.    Back then, Mr. Manzella had a vague view of Mr. Dukakis and worried that he was someone &quot;I wouldn't trust.&quot; But when the Journal went back to him this week, Mr. Manzella, a Democrat, had changed his tune. Now, the 61-year-old retired credit manager for East Ohio Gas Co. says Mr. Dukakis earned his vote through his performance as someone who &quot;never gets ruffled&quot; and who &quot;has held his composure&quot; while going through the primary meat grinder.    Similarly, on the Republican side, 32-year-old jeweler Chris Gumpp no longer thinks, as she did last year, that Vice President Bush is &quot;wishy-washy,&quot; &quot;wordy&quot; and a &quot;wimp.&quot; Now she says, &quot;he's kind of showing us that he's his own person.&quot;    With the Ohio primary only days away, the 10 Democrats and 11 Republicans expressed generally higher opinions of both candidates than they did when political analyst Peter Hart first gathered them together for the Journal. The grueling primary process has won their respect for the survivors, they say.    Hurdles loom ahead for both men. Voters are still unsure about Mr. Dukakis on national-security issues, for example, and they think that Mr. Bush has yet to offer a coherent vision for the country beyond &quot;more of the same.&quot;    But these Ohioans say they're comfortable with the choice between the two tortoises of the 1988 race. Mr. Dukakis &quot;is a man I could vote for with pride,&quot; says Jean DeGarmo, a 57-year-old clerk-typist who originally favored New York Gov. Mario Cuomo. Mary Pat Blubaugh, a 59-year-old homemaker in the GOP group who had qualms about supporting Mr. Bush a year ago, now says, &quot;I feel better about it, much better.&quot;    These two small groups of voters don't seem much bothered by the prospect of a race between men short of charisma. &quot;I don't think there's anything wrong with it being dull,&quot; concludes Paul Blohm, 59, an insurance adjuster and Republican. &quot;I don't think you have to have Ferris wheels and shoot off fireworks to have an election.&quot;    The loyal Mr. Bush and the steady Mr. Dukakis seem to be on an equal footing at the starting line. &quot;The Dukakis-Bush race is no David-and-Goliath contest where one person is perceived as clearly the giant and the other as the little boy,&quot; concludes Mr. Hart, who conducted the discussion groups again here Sunday night.    Such discussion groups don't constitute anything like a scientific sample, of course. But these voters' views do illustrate some of the crosscurrents and concerns at work as Ohio prepares to go to the polls Tuesday -- and as voters across the country begin to contemplate the autumn match-up.    When these Canton residents first got together for the Journal last May, they were shellshocked by the Wall Street, Iran-Contra and &quot;televangelist&quot; scandals. New controversies, including questions about Attorney General Edwin Meese, have stirred more concern about ethics. But a year ago, few economic clouds were on the horizon; the Oct. 19 stock-market crash has since sparked worry here, particularly among the Democrats. For them, the economy is deteriorating, and a change at the top is needed to halt the slide.    &quot;I don't think we can go through four more years of this type of administration. Something's going to break, and I think it's going to be us. If Bush gets in, I don't see any change,&quot; laments Democrat Victoria Cannell, a 30-year-old schoolteacher. But Karen Rohrer, a 34-year-old administrative assistant, emphasizes a common concern: &quot;Change either way too quickly scares me,&quot; she says.    For that reason, Jesse Jackson wasn't a comfortable choice for them. Several Democrats say they would bolt the party if he becomes Mr. Dukakis's running mate. Still, many in both groups express surprise and respect for Mr. Jackson's success so far. &quot;This man is saying some of the things we want {Mr. Dukakis} to hear,&quot; Mrs. DeGarmo says. James Frutschy, the 38-year-old video director at the Pro Football Hall of Fame and also a Democrat, adds: &quot;I like what he's saying, but I don't like him.&quot;    While the Democrats hunger for change, the Republicans seem to live in a different world. Mr. Bush, they say, will provide just what the country needs: a continuation of President Reagan's revitalization of America. &quot;I think the economy is doing great,&quot; says Dennis Fulmer, a 34-year-old portfolio manager and a Republican. &quot;Companies are back booming again.&quot; Mrs. Blubaugh agrees: &quot;It's wonderful to see so many help-wanted signs.&quot;    Given the sharp divisions in how the Republican and Democratic groups view the state of the nation, &quot;two worlds are about to collide&quot; in the election, Mr. Hart concludes. &quot;One is very complacent, very satisfied, and one insists on change.&quot;    Those sentiments help explain the relative satisfaction the two groups show toward the candidates. The methodical Mr. Dukakis represents non-threatening change; the patient Mr. Bush represents continuity with a new face. But although both men have achieved established images with these voters, they still have a long way to go to add substance.    Among Democrats, a principal concern is that Mr. Dukakis, with his background in state government, lacks experience in foreign policy. &quot;Foreign affairs -- I really don't know where he stands on anything,&quot; Mrs. Cannell says. Mrs. DeGarmo acknowledges that Mr. Bush is &quot;a little more experienced in foreign policy,&quot; so she wants to see someone such as Georgia Sen. Sam Nunn on the Dukakis team. &quot;He could be our foreign-policy handler.&quot;    The Democrats are also watching closely how Mr. Dukakis deals with Mr. Jackson: They want to see him treat his challenger fairly without pandering. &quot;They can see Mike Dukakis in the Oval Office now, but how he deals with Jesse Jackson is absolutely pivotal,&quot; says analyst Hart, a Democrat who isn't involved in this year's presidential race. &quot;The No. 2 hurdle is foreign policy. And he needs to reassure people on fiscal discipline.&quot;    The Republican voters have unanswered questions about Mr. Bush as well. &quot;I would like to hear him say how he can reduce our national debt or even work on it,&quot; says Raymond Rubin, a 67-year-old retired accountant. Several say they don't know enough about how he would tackle drug and trade problems. &quot;I'd like to know . . . how he's going to handle future terrorists,&quot; Mrs. Gumpp says. Mr. Rubin says he &quot;would like to have him finally give an answer on this Iran affair and the arms sale instead of just conveniently forgetting.&quot;    Mindful of the scandals that have engulfed Reagan administration appointees such as Attorney General Edwin Meese, Mr. Blohm, the insurance adjuster, wants assurances that a President Bush would &quot;watch your appointments {and} do a good background check on them.&quot;    When each of these two groups looks at the other party's candidate, the Democrats' greater concern about the country's course translates into a sharp anti-Bush feeling. Stephen Geier, a 48-year-old laborer, calls the vice president &quot;dishonest.&quot; Mrs. Cannell says, &quot;It scares me to think of him as president.&quot; Mrs. Rohrer comments: &quot;Dukakis appears to be his own person, whereas Bush tends to be a follower.&quot;    Republicans, meanwhile, fear Mr. Dukakis's economics. &quot;I've heard how he's raised taxes in Massachusetts. . . . I think that would be a good reason not to vote for him,&quot; says Joan Wetmore, a 64-year-old Republican housewife. Mr. Fulmer, the stockbroker, says that if Mr. Dukakis says he's going to raise taxes, &quot;he's going to lose because of it.&quot; However, the voters in this GOP group don't seem as negative about Mr. Dukakis as their Democratic counterparts are about Mr. Bush. Robert Rath, a 54-year-old GOP steel-tubing salesman, says he may even vote for the Democrat. &quot;My wife is Greek,&quot; he explains. </TEXT></DOC>
