Supporters of the measure, which will remain in effect for 90days, said it was needed because of uncertainty over whether thedistrict's ban on capital punishment could be used to blockextradition of juvenile suspects facing a possible death sentence.That question is now before a district court.   The 17-year-old teen-ager, identified only by the initials O.M.,could face murder and arson charges in connection with an April1988 firebombing of a Gadsen, Ala., apartment that took the life ofa 14-month-old boy. The teen-ager is being held here pending adecision on Alabama's extradition request.   During more than three hours of debate Tuesday, supporters ofthe measure said a jurisdiction that bans capital punishment shouldnot subject a suspect in its custody to the death penaltyelsewhere. Others also raised questions about whether the youth,who is black, would receive a fair trial.   ``It is reprehensible that a jurisdiction would even considerapplying a death penalty to a juvenile,'' said William Lightfoot, acouncil member. ``That is not civilized conduct.''   Another member, Nadine Winter, said that by refusing toextradite the youth the district could gain a reputation as a``haven'' for juveniles accused of serious crimes.   At a recent court hearing, relatives of the teen-ager recountedalleged racial abuse by Gadsen officials. Also reviewed at thehearing were comments recently made to The Washington Post by thecounty's only juvenile judge, Robert E. Lewis, in which Lewissuggested he thought the teen-ager likely was involved in thefirebombing.   The emergency legislation, which would apply only to O.M., wassought after a recent court hearing left in doubt whether thedistrict's existing laws were sufficient to block the extradition.   The teen-ager's attorney, Gerald Fisher, argued the district'sdeath penalty ban must be applied by district courts whenconsidering interstate juvenile extraditions.   But Paul Alper, representing the district government, said anationwide juvenile extradition agreement does not give thedistrict discretion to approve or reject requests on the basis ofwhether the juvenile might face the death penalty.   A three-judge panel is considering the case but has notindicated when it would rule. The Supreme Court has set precedentin adult extradition cases but attorneys involved in the districtcase said there has been no test case involving a juvenile beforethe high court.</TEXT></DOC>
