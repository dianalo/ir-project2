Among those expected to be replaced were the prime minister, thehead of the main intelligence agency and the home, labor andconstruction ministers, the officials said, speaking on conditionof anonymity.   All major Seoul newspapers carried reports of the expectedchanges, which was expected to take place in the coming weeks,officials said.   Reports of the Cabinet changes came as a hunger strike by 300radical students entered a fourth day Monday. The protesters wantRoh to step down.   Many of the hunger strikers at the Roman Catholic MyongdongCathedral appeared weak and eight collapsed from fatigue butrefused to resume eating. Riot police surrounded the cathedral, butmade no move to intervene.   Also on Monday, violence broke out in the streets of southernKwangju when riot police blocked a march by about 5,000 radicalstudents calling for Roh's resignation, the South Korean newsagency Yonhap reported.   Anti-government protests by dissidents and students havedwindled in recent weeks with police blocking many rallies. Theradical students lack public support because of their extremistviews.   Under the Cabinet changes, senior ministers and Prime MinisterKang Young-hoon will take the blame for recent unrest, theofficials said.   Roh, who won presidential elections in 1987, is unhappy thatministers have failed to win public confidence, officials said. Thepresident believes the administration needs a new, stronger image,they said.   ``Cabinet members to be replaced have not been decided, but itis highly possible that the shuffle will affect many posts,'' oneofficial said.   In South Korea, periodic Cabinet shuffles stop the presdientfrom having to take responsibility for government failures. Inreality, however, Cabinet ministers have little autonomy.   Park Seh-jik, head of the Agency for National Security Planning,is being blamed for the security forces' failure to stop adissident clergyman, the Rev. Moon Ik-hwan, from visiting NorthKorea in March. Moon's visit led to violent confrontations betweenpolice and dissidents, who want both nations reunited.   Home Minister Lee Han-dong may be blamed for the threatenedresignation in April of thousands of police officers after anopposition lawmaker slapped a top police commander, the officialssaid.   Labor Minister Chang Yung-chul and Social Affairs Minister MoonTai-joon are expected to take the blame for recent violent laborstrikes for higher pay, the officials said. Construction MinisterPark Seung may be removed because of widespread land speculationcaused by plans to build new cities, they said.</TEXT></DOC>
