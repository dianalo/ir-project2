The researchers studied the effects in the blood when ninehealthy people took 18 fish oil capsules a day for six weeks.   ``We found a very dramatic reduction in the ability of theirwhite blood cells to make tumor necrosis factor and interleukin-1,''said Dr. Charles A. Dinarello, who reported his study in the NewEngland Journal of Medicine.   ``This is the first time that any dietary manipulation has beenshown to change the production of these inflammatory compounds.''   Doctors have long noticed that Eskimos and others who eat lots ofoily ocean fish have less heart disease than other people. They alsoare less likely to get arthritis, juvenile diabetes and otherdiseases that involve overactive inflammatory responses.   Some studies suggest that fish oil supplements can lower bloodcholesterol, protecting the arteries from damaging buildups.   Dinarello, a researcher at New England Medical Center in Boston,said the latest work implies that fish oil also protects the heartby reducing inflammation in the arteries that may lead to thickeningof the artery walls.   Ten weeks after they stopped taking fish oil, the volunteers'production of interleukin-1 had fallen 61 percent and tumor necrosisfactor had dropped 40 percent.   Dinarello cautioned that the study did not include a comparisongroup, and said other kinds of oil supplements could have similareffects.   While tumor necrosis factor was first noticed for its ability toshrink tumors, doctors believe its most important role in the bodyis causing inflammation in response to injury.   Tumor necrosis factor has failed to work as a cancer treatment,and Dinarello said there is no evidence that reducing its levels inthe body would increase susceptibility to cancer.</TEXT></DOC>
