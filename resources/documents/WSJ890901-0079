WHEN THERE'S a radiation leak at a nuclear plant, who wants to go check it out?    Scientists at the University of Michigan are developing a robot-mounted camera to do the job.    While devices exist to detect and measure radioactive contamination, the Michigan camera sees, or rather, senses where radiation is coming from. Radiation leaks are normally invisible, but the camera contains chemical substances that are sensitive to gamma rays. The camera can process the radiation detected by the substances and convert the impulses into a color image displayed on a television screen.    The intensity of the color indicates the level of gamma radiation and the presence of other types of radioactive contamination. Because gamma rays can penetrate most metals, the camera could detect them without dismantling pipes or containers.    Researchers hope the camera, being developed under a three-year, $491,000 Energy Department grant, will &quot;keep people out of dangerous radioactive environments,&quot; says David K. Wehe, assistant professor of nuclear engineering. But not for a while: The camera's picture ability and durability still need improvement. &quot;We're three years from turning it over to an industrial partner,&quot; he says.    Fiber-Optic Technology    Turns to Gyroscopes    IT TOOK THREE decades for a new technology to challenge mechanical, spinning-wheel gyroscopes in navigation systems. But just as that technology -- called &quot;ring-laser gyros&quot; -- starts to win wide acceptance, along comes an even newer technology to rival it.    The upstart is the fiber-optic gyroscope.    Gyroscopes, when combined with an accelerometer and a computer, enable aircraft, ships and a variety of unmanned vehicles to measure speed, direction and exact location.    Ring-laser gyros determine the angle at which a vehicle is moving by measuring the differences in speed of two counter-rotating beams of light inside a mirrored, gas-filled path. When a laser gyroscope is still, each light pulse takes the same time to travel the distance. In motion, one light beam takes longer, indicating a rotation in pitch, roll or yaw.    In the newer fiber-optic gyroscopes, light pulses travel in opposite directions around a spool of optical fiber.    Litton Industries Inc., which already makes ring-laser gyroscopes, is working on fiber-optic devices and views them as potentially cheaper and more durable than ring-laser gear. The telecommunications industry has made optical fiber relatively inexpensive, and the need to seal in the gas makes ring-laser gyros fragile and limits their life span.    Litton and Honeywell Inc., another company developing fiber-optic gyros, say the devices may initially take over simpler tasks in backup aircraft navigation systems, tactical missiles and &quot;smart&quot; munitions. Both companies are testing fiber-optic gyros in aircraft guidance systems.    Next month, Litton will deliver to the Army a 1.2-inch-diameter fiber-optic gyro designed to guide an experimental artillery shell. The fiber-optic gyro beat out a laser device for use in the experimental shell because it was considered sturdier.    &quot;Within three years we'll see fiber-optic gyros starting to replace laser gyros in certain applications,&quot; says A. David Klein, a Litton executive.    Scientists Pick Camera    To Detect Apple Bruises    TO KEEP A FEW bad apples from spoiling the barrel, scientists are developing a computer-aided camera system to spot defective fruit.    Packing and processing inspectors currently scrutinize apples rolling past them at a rate of six per second. Many injured apples go undetected because bruises often take time to show up on the fruit's skin.    Researchers at the Agriculture Department say a system using cameras aided by computer software could spot blemishes before browning occurs and help packers sort the produce according to color, size and grade. A similar camera system is already used for oranges, but apples require more sophisticated technology because they have more natural variations.    Government scientists in Kearneysville, W.Va., are experimenting with a video camera to examine Red Delicious apples through a lens filter. The method breaks down a light beam into its individual colors, or wavelengths. When a light beam is directed at the apples, bruised areas can be detected because they reflect less of certain beams.    The system is still a few years from market, the researchers say.    Odds and Ends    THE FBI ENLISTED a camera originally meant for plant-cell study to do some sleuthing. Designed by University of Illinois scientists, the camera produces digitally constructed images of plant cells. But because of the camera's ability to clarify details, the FBI requested that it be used on a blurry bank security photograph taken during a robbery. Investigators now know the criminal sports a goatee. . . . Seventeen timber bridges will be built by the Pennsylvania Transportation Department this year to test a theory that old-fashioned wooden bridges, because they don't rust, may be more cost effective than modern steel structures. . . . Zenith Electronics Corp. introduced a voice-controlled PC system for quadriplegics. But the workstation, using a voice recognition system by Prab Command Inc. is pricey: $21,990, or $49,990 with a robotic arm and printer. </TEXT></DOC>
