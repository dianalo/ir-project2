This action will not result in an annual effecton the economy of $100 million or more; a major increase in costs or pricesfor consumers, individual industries, Federal, State, or local governmentagencies or geographic regions; or significant adverse effects on competition,employment, investment, productivity, innovation, or on the ability ofUnited States-based enterprises to compete with foreign-based enterprisesin domestic or export markets.<ITAG tagnum="84">Environmental Impact Statement</ITAG>This document has been reviewed in accordance with 7 CFR Part 1940 SubpartG, ``Environmental Program.'' It is the determination of FmHA that theproposed action does not constitute a major Federal action significantlyaffecting the quality of the human environment, and in accordance withthe National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, Public Law 91-190, an EnvironmentalImpact Statement is not required.<ITAG tagnum="84">Intergovernmental Review</ITAG>This program is listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance undernumber 10.422, and is subject to the provisions of Executive Order 12372which requires intergovernmental consultation with State and local officials.(7 CFR Part 3105, Subpart V; 48 FR 29112, June 24, 1983; 49 FR 2267, May31, 1984; 50 FR 14088, April 10, 1985).<ITAG tagnum="84">Discussion of Interim Rule</ITAG>It is the policy of this Department that rules relating to public property,loans, grants, benefits or contracts shall be published for comment notwithstandingthe exemption of 5 U.S.C. 553 with respect to such rules. However, FmHAis making this action effective immediately upon publication in the<T4> Federal Register </T4>without securing prior public comment. The purposeof this rule is to provide assistance to businesses which have been distressedby natural disasters that have occurred in 1988.Especially as a result of drought across most of the country, an emergencysituation exists. This interim rule is a response to an existing situationand, while this Department is reluctant to short circuit prior public comment,it is certain that failure to implement a mandated program at once willresult in significant economic harm to the public.FmHA believes it is essential that this assistance be made available assoon as possible before it is too late for the businesses to recover. Thetypical drought-impacted business in rural communities was, going in tothe 1988 season, only beginning to recover from the serious agriculturaland other physical and economic problems of the preceding decade. Forbearingcreditors, aware that any business depends on its customers' economic health,can forbear just so long. Rural businesses and their creditors must planfor the immediate economic future. Without immediate implementation ofprograms of financial assistance, there is no reason to assume the creditorsof rural businesses devastated by the blow to the agricultural and otherrural business sectors will_or can_continue to forbear.The Disaster Assistance Act of 1988, moreover, states ``(1) the disasterousdrought of 1988 is adversely affecting a large number of States, with seriouseconomic consequences for family farmers; (2) the harm caused by the droughtis not limited to farmers, but extends to each rural community whose economicviability is being devastated; (3) rural businesses and financial institutionsare already experiencing the negative effects of decreased sales, and theyanticipate severe problems over the next year, due to crop failures andthe unavailability of credit * * *.''Likewise, the Joint Explanatory Statement of the Conference Committee inreporting HR-5015 (now Pub. L. 100-387) is emphatic in treating programsunder the Act as emergency matters, and states ``the conferees expect theSecretary of Agriculture to carry out the provisions of this bill in asefficient and straightforward manner as possible. Paperwork should be simplifiedand procedures to receive assistance should be expedited.'' The Departmentis now finalizing regulations streamlining the Bandamp;I program and thisrule further eases requirements applicable to disaster assistance loanguarantees to be processed under the Bandamp;I program. The Secretary meansto get this assistance in place now to minimize the human and financialtragedy that is the aftermath of the drought and other natural disastersof 1988.The Department is well aware that an emergency exists because of the naturaldisasters of 1988. Rapid delivery of economic assistance is essential.A major study by the Chamber of Commerce of the United States in 1985 ishelpful in assessing the impact of rural industrial jobs. That study dealtwith job creation within a community and concluded that 100 new industrialjobs support 351 people and increase personal incomes by $1,030,000. Anadded 97 households depend on those 100 jobs, as do $600,000 in retailsales. Those sales would support one additional retailer and 68 retailjobs. Making credit available promptly for drought-impacted rural businessesand industries is, therefore, of importance.Public comments will be accepted for 60 days and later revisions will bemade to this interim rule if justified on the basis of comments received.This procedure will make assistance available now. The usual course ofa proposed rule, comment period, comment analysis, and a final rule incorporatingchanges would inevitably mean a 60 to 90 day delay in getting assistancewhere it is most needed. Those seeking to comment and make suggestionsfor improvement should be advised that final action will occur as promptlyas possible after the 60 day comment period.<ITAG tagnum="84">Discussion of the Rule</ITAG>FmHA is implementing section 331 of the Disaster Assistance Act of 1988by adding an appendix for this new program at the end of its Business andIndustry loan program. The loan guarantees authorized and implemented bythis action will be called Drought and Disaster Guaranteed Loans. Theseloans will be available to generally the same type of entities as Businessand Industry loans for generally the same type of loan purposes as Businessand Industry loans, through generally the same type of lenders. The majordifferences between Drought and Disaster loans and Business and Industryloans are as follows:(1) Drought and Disaster loans must assist in alleviating financial distresscaused to rural business entities by drought, hail, excessive moisture,or related conditions in 1988 or assist such entities which refinance orrestructure debt as the result of losses incurred because of such naturaldisasters.(2) Drought and Disaster loans for refinancing may allow an existing lenderto bring that part of its existing unguaranteed debt that has been adverselyaffected by a disaster under the new guarantee. In no case will the guaranteeexceed 90 percent of loan principal.(3) The maximum amount of Drought and Disaster loans to any one borroweris $500,000.(4) The requirement for borrower's equity contribution to the businessmay be somewhat smaller for a Drought and Disaster guaranteed loan thanfor a Business and Industry loan, although that equity must be positiveand must be such that when considered with other credit factors, repaymentof the loan and continued success of the business operation are reasonablyassured.(5) The guarantee on a Drought and Disaster loan will cover principal onlyand will not cover interest or protective advances.Generally, except where the Disaster Assistance Act mandates otherwise,FmHA has sought to minimize differences between these loans and Businessand Industry loans so that field staff, lenders, and others already familiarwith Bandamp;I guaranteed loans will be able to handle these loans withoutany significant training or research. This will expedite the provisionof needed assistance.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 7 CFR Part 1980</ITAG>Loan Programs_Business and industry_Rural development assistance, Ruralareas.Accordingly, Title 7, Chapter XVIII, of the Code of Federal Regulationsis amended as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 1980_GENERAL</ITAG>1.
