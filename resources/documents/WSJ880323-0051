The early-morning rally began after the Commerce Department reported an unexpected 1.8% drop in new orders for big-ticket factory goods in February. That was the second monthly decline in a row, prompting some analysts to question the widely held view that the economy will continue to expand at a moderate pace in coming months.    Most economists in several recent surveys had expected an increase in durable-goods orders. Yesterday's report prompted some to reiterate their belief that investors' fears about inflation amount to paranoia.    Federal Reserve Board Governor Martha Seger told reporters yesterday that the Commerce Department report confirms her view that economic growth this quarter will be &quot;flat to slightly down.&quot; Many other Fed officials, though, expect continued economic growth throughout this year, and several have indicated they are increasingly concerned about inflation.    &quot;Nobody believes Martha Seger on the idea of a first-quarter economic decline,&quot; says Alan Bozian, a first vice president of Union Bank of Switzerland.    Nevertheless, Mr. Bozian and many others remain equally skeptical about forecasts of higher inflation and increased interest rates. &quot;I just don't buy all those fears about inflation,&quot; Mr. Bozian says. &quot;There are enough problems in the economy to keep the Fed from raising rates.&quot; He said he is &quot;staying on the sidelines for now&quot; because &quot;it doesn't pay to be in the market until we get a clearer picture of what's going on&quot; in the economy.    Several traders said part of the reason yesterday morning's bond rally fizzled so quickly was concern about a rise in the prices of many commodities. Also, traders are apprehensive about a government report this morning on consumer prices for February. Many forecasters expect the report to show an increase of about 0.2%.    The bond market's failure to hold its early gains troubled some observers. &quot;It really doesn't bode well for the market to get a good number like this (the durable-goods report) and then not make headway on the upside,&quot; said John R. Burrus, president and chief executive officer of CRT Government Securities Ltd. &quot;The market just feels heavy.&quot;    At one stage early yesterday, some actively traded long-term Treasury bonds were up by about half a point, or around $5 for each $1,000 face amount. But the most actively traded 30-year Treasury bonds, the government's 8 7/8% bonds due in 2017, finished the session at a price of 101 24/32, down very slightly from 101 26/32 Monday. The yield climbed to 8.71% from 8.70%.    The government's 8 1/8% notes due in 1998 dipped to 97 26/32 from 97 27/32. The yield remained at about 8.45%.    Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.'s index of long-term Treasury bonds also was little changed. The index declined by 0.20 point to 1279.19. The high for the day was 1286.40, and the low was 1276.45.    A large volume of new Treasury notes will be offered today and tomorrow. Today, the government will sell about $8.5 billion of new two-year notes. In when-issued trading late yesterday, the notes were quoted at 7.35%. Tomorrow, the government will sell $6.5 billion of four-year notes. Traders last night estimated a yield of around 7.80% to 7.85%.    Rates rose slightly on short-term Treasury bills. The latest three-month bill was quoted at 5.81% bid, up from an average of 5.76% set at Monday's auction. The rate on the latest six-month bills rose to 5.97% bid from 5.96%.    In addition to the consumer price index report to be released today, the government also will issue a revised estimate of the economy's growth in last year's fourth quarter. According to the average estimate of 15 economists surveyed by Dow Jones Capital Markets Report, the economy grew at a 4.6% annual clip, after adjusting for inflation. That would compare with the department's earlier estimate of 4.5% growth for that quarter. </TEXT></DOC>
