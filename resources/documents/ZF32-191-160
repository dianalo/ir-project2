(Products).andO;Product:   Microsoft Windows (Graphical user interface) (Computer programs)Vellum CAD for Windows (CAD software).andO;Topic:     Computer-aided designSoftware packagesEvaluation.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>ASHLAR'S VELLUM CAD created quite a stir when it was first introduced for theMac, more than a year ago.andP;  The computer-aided design and drafting packagegot favorable attention for its revolutionary interface, which employsartificial intelligence techniques to guide the user in placing the elementsof a drawing.andP;  Now the product is available in a Windows version that'snearly identical to the Mac offering.andM;In fact, the only significant difference is that the Windows version correctsa highly criticized omission in the Mac product, making Windows Vellumsuitable as both a general-purpose and an engineering-only drafting program.andO;The change is the addition of two features: You can measure dimensions infractions as well as in decimals, and you can create commonly usedarchitectural crosshatch patterns.andM;Vellum's innovative &quot;artificially intelligent&quot; drawing guide, called TheDrafting Assistant, shows light gray guidelines and text in small capitals toadvise you of the relationship between the current location of the cursor andany objects already onscreen.andP;  The Drawing Assistant flashes on and off asthe cursor moves about the screen.andP;  For instance, if the line-drawing toolwere selected, The Drafting Assistant might advise that the next point couldbe tangent to one object, aligned to another, and about to snap to the centerpoint of yet another.andP;  This makes it extremely easy for anyone new todrafting to see the relationship of objects to one another, which is veryimportant in mechanical drawing.andP;  For experienced users, The DraftingAssistant eliminates guesswork and calculations.andM;Two other factors help make Vellum the easiest-to-use two-dimensionaldrafting program: A strict adherence to the Windows user interface and adimensioning feature called Integrated Parametrics, which lets you preciselyscale an object after drawing it, just by substituting correct dimensions foran entity's temporary item label, such as &quot;L1.&quot; The feature also makes anytwo objects that use the same scaling symbol scale to the same dimensions.andM;There are two common situations in which Integrated Parametrics is of greathelp.andP;  First, a designer can quickly sketch a concept and then create aprecise technical drawing from the sketch simply by substituting correctdimensions for a symbol.andP;  Second, a detail insert in a drawing, made bycopying a group of selected shapes from the main drawing, need never bescaled separately from the parts from which it originated.andM;When it comes to power and features, Vellum is a solid competitor amongmid-priced 2-D drafting packages.andP;  There are even such niceties as automatedcircular and rectangular arrays (regularly spaced multiple copies of the sameitem) and automatically drawn walls (parallel lines placed at a predefineddistance from one another) with automatically attached end-caps whenrequired.andM;Vellum's most direct 2-D competitor is Drafix Windows CAD (see the review inthe March issue, page 46).andP;  Drafix is noticeably less intuitive, partlybecause its interface is less conventional than Vellum's and partly becauseit lacks features similar to Vellum's Drafting Assistant.andP;  On the other hand,Drafix has somewhat wider choices in drawing and editing tools, more drawingmethods, and a built-in macro language.andP;  Both packages are well designed.andP;  Ifcustomization would be a major time-saver for you, get Drafix.andP;  But Vellum isthe best choice for ease of use in general CAD applications by office andoccasional users.andP;  M.
