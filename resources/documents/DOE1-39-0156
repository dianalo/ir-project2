The GOS is related to the differential cross section for excitationin ion-atom collisions in the plane-wave Born approximation (PWBA). TheGOS for a particular transition is a function of the momentum transferredfrom the relative motion to the atom. Approximate scaling of the GOSis sometimes found along an isoelectronic sequence, but is not foundfor those cases we have studied for which the GOS has a minimum. Twodifferent mechanisms produce minima of the GOS; one is due essentiallyto nodes of one-electron radial wave functions, and the other is an effectof the configuration interaction that introduces an avoided crossingof energy levels plotted against the nuclear charge. A minimum of theGOS sometimes leads to a double-maximum structure of the integral crosssection for ion-atom collisions in the PWBA, though one usually expectsthe PWBA to produce only one maximum.</TEXT></DOC>
