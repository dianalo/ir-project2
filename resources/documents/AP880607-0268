DRISCOLL</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><TEXT>   Corn futures advanced strongly and soybeans finished slightlyhigher despite some earlier profit taking Tuesday on the ChicagoBoard of Trade.   Wheat futures, on the other hand, fell by a nickel or more perbushel.   On other markets, livestock and meat futures were mixed; energywas higher; and precious metals declined.   On Monday, prices on all six agricultural commodities had soaredthe daily permissible limit at the opening at the Board of Trade andstayed there as hot, dry weather in the Midwest showed no signs ofletting up.   By contrast, commodities futures prices were very volatile onTuesday, particularly in soybeans.   ``Nonetheless, the performance was impressive,'' said RichFeltes, commodity research director in Chicago for Refco Inc.   Soybeans had increased more than $1 a bushel in the last week andhad two consecutive sessions of 30 cent-limit gains going intoTuesday's session.   Prices opened sharply higher again, sold off almost immediately,staged a comeback and then faded near the close.   ``The market was up so sharply, it was due to pull back,'' saidWalter Spilka, an analyst in New York with Smith Barney, HarrisUpham andamp; Co.   ``Traders have made enough money and were willing to sell, andand selling tends to touch off further selling,'' he said.   By day's end, the July soybean contract had traveled between ahigh of $9.09 a bushel to a low of $8.66 and closed with a 3-centgain over Monday at $8.82.   Wheat futures prices fell, however. Weekly crop reports releasedlate Monday showed the deterioration in the winter wheat crop, whichis about to be harvested, was not as severe as had been expected,said Jerry Gidel, an analyst in Chicago with G.H. Miller andamp; Co.   Wheat settled 4} cents to 14 cents lower with the contract fordelivery in July at $3.78 a bushel; corn was 9 cents to 12} centshigher with July at $2.57\ a bushel; oats were 6 cents to the limit15 cents higher with July at $2.21{ a bushel; and soybeans were 10{cents lower to 3 cents higher with July at $8.82 a bushel.   With a relatively subdued performance in grains, some upwardprice pressure was taken off livestock futures at the ChicagoMercantile Exchange.   Over the last few sessions, the distant delivery months of porkand cattle have been pushed higher by the cost of grain, saidCharlie Richardson, an analyst in Denver with Lind-Waldock andamp; Co. Hesaid traders felt higher feed costs would reduce production ofbroilers and competition for red meat.   Hog producers also were expected to slow expansion.   ``So, with the grain market not nearly as wild as it was the lasttwo sessions, we had some pressure relieved'' on livestock prices,said Richardson.   Live cattle settled .50 cent lower to .85 cent higher with theJune contract at 73.10 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .75 cent to1 cent higher with August at 75.92 cents a pound; live hogs were .77cent lower to .50 cent higher with June at 52.92 cents a pound; andfrozen pork bellies were 1.25 cents lower to 1.35 cents higher withJuly at 54.87 cents a pound.   Energy futures moved slightly higher on the New York MercantileExchange.   Prices were merely rebounding from sizable technical losses theday before, said Nauman Barakat, an analyst in New York withShearson Lehman Hutton Inc.   ``In addition,'' he said, ``there are some rumors that OPEC isgoing to work out some compromises.'' Ministers of the Organizationof Petroleum Exporting Countries meet in Vienna beginning Saturday.   ``There's been some talk they'll attempt to get Iraq back as anactive member of the cartel,'' he said. ``And also rumors thatthey're ready to restart a dialog with non-OPEC nations.''   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 3 cents to 11 centshigher with the July contract at $17.37 a barrel; heating oil was.25 cent to .46 cent higher with July at 46.23 cents a gallon; andunleaded gasoline was .10 cent to .47 cent higher with July at 50.20cents a gallon.   Precious metals futures were lower on the Commodity Exchange inNew York.   Gold settled $2.90 to $3.40 lower with the June contract at $460a troy ounce; and silver was 3.5 cents to 3.8 cents lower with Julyat $7.28 a troy ounce.</TEXT></DOC>
