His visit is the first by a Kuwaiti leader since 1968.   The prime minister met first with Defense Secretary Frank C.Carlucci and planned to meet later in the day with Deputy Secretaryof State John Whitehead.   At the top of Crown Prince and Prime Minister Sheik SaadAl-Abdullah Al-Sabah's agenda was a move by Congress last week toblock a purchase of air-to-surface missiles from the United States.   Opponents of the deal were concerned the Mavericks could be usedagainst Israel in the event of another Middle East war.   The missiles were stripped from a $1.8 billion package of 40F-18 jet fighter bombers. The White House and the State Departmentcriticized the congressional action and said Kuwait should beenabled to defend itself with U.S. weapons.   State Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley said the oil-richcountry faced a threat from Iran.   The crown prince flew to Washington on Sunday aboard a jumbo jetthat was hijacked in April, to underscore his country'sdenunciation of terrorism. The same pilot was at the controls.   Kuwait has staunchly refused to negotiate with terrorists. Ithas sustained atttacks but refused to yield 17 prisoners held onterrorism charges.   The country is considered pro-Western, but has dealt with theSoviet Union over the years. The Kuwaiti defense ministry saidSaturday the arms deal with Moscow was in accordance with a policyof having a diversified source of weapons.   In statements published Sunday in Kuwaiti newspapers, Sheik Saadsaid the choice of the jet, named Al-Jaberiya, was made ``tosymbolize Kuwait's firm rejection of terrorism and blackmail.''   The emir of Kuwait, Sheik Jaber Al-Ahmed Al-Sabah, also flewaboard Al-Jaberiya when he attended the emergency Arab summitconference in Algiers that concentrated on the Palestinian problem.   It was in the Algerian capital that a group of terrorists, saidto be pro-Iranian Moslem fundamentalists, released the plane thatthey commandeered April 5 from a Bangkok-Kuwait flight after a16-day ordeal and the killing of two Kuwaiti passengers.   Another Kuwait Airways jetliner was hijacked in 1985, when twoAmerican passengers were murdered. In both instances, Kuwait stoodfast against the demand of the terrorists for the release of 17companions in Kuwaiti jails, convicted for the 1983 car bombing ofthe U.S. and French embassies.   Three of the 17 were sentenced to death but the sentences havenot yet been carried out. Their release is also a demand of theIslamic Jihad group in Beirut in return for release of the Americanhostages that it holds.   Sheik Saad was interviewed by editors of the Kuwaiti newspapersAl-Watan and Kuwait Times while aboard Al-Jaberiya, which is namedafter the emir.   He said his meeting on Tuesday with President Reagan and withother U.S. officials throughout the week would center on``bilateral relations, the Iraq-Iran war, the Middle East problemand the Palestinian uprising.''</TEXT></DOC>
