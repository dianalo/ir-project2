But the Arab uprising changed that, and hemarried in a simple ceremony last month.   ``I didn't think it was the right time for dancing and musicwhen Palestinians are being killed and wounded,'' said Abed, a26-year-old school bus driver from Bethlehem.   The 6{-month-old uprising has radically changed the lives of allPalestinians in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, not justthose directly involved in confrontations with Israel.   ``The uprising has had a great impact on our social and economicstructures,'' said Saib Erakat, a political science professor atthe West Bank's An-Najah University. ``The old traditions arefading away.''   Palestinians say their communities, once dominated by religiousleaders and wealthy merchants, are now run by young activists, manyfrom poor backgrounds.   ``Today you are not judged by how rich or famous you are, youare judged by how active you are in the uprising,'' said AmjadSarawi, 26, an activist and unemployed laborer from the Dheisherefugee camp near Bethlehem.   The uprising also has affected daily routines.   Fatima Musa, 47, of Dheishe, said she used to go shopping everySaturday, but now she has to wait for PLO leaflets announcingcommercial strikes before she can make out her shopping list.   ``The uprising created a new daily life,'' Mrs. Musa, a motherof seven, said while peeling potatoes in her sparsely furnishedliving room. ``We have a different strike day every week, and thatmeans I can't have a steady schedule.''   Because of widespread strikes and curfews, many families haveorganized car pools with their neighbors to do the shopping. Othersare stocking up on basic food items.   Ata Moghrabi, 62, a retired laborer, keeps two bags each ofsugar, rice and flour in his garage. ``We don't know what isawaiting us tomorrow,'' Moghrabi said.   Since the start of the uprising, money has become tight andPalestinians only buy essentials.   Many young women no longer wear makeup, some as an expression ofmourning for the more than 200 Palestinians killed in the uprising.   Others put away their lipstick after being threatened by youngmilitants. In Bethlehem last month, two masked youths approachedtwo teen-age girls in the city's central market and ordered them towipe off their makeup as a sign of respect for the uprising. Theterrified girls complied.   The uprising has also put an end to most entertainment. Manymovie theaters and restaurants are closed, and the traditionalSaturday night parties have been canceled.   Abed's wedding last month was a subdued affair in which thenewlyweds' closest relatives briefly stopped by for soft drinks andcake after the ceremony.   It was a far cry from traditional weddings, a cornerstone ofPalestinian social life, in which hundreds of relatives and friendsare served elaborate meals and are entertained by bands.   Abed said a man identifying himself only as a Palestiniannationalist called a few days before the ceremony and demanded thatit be kept simple, without music or dancing.   ``I warn you, and if you don't follow these instructions, you'llregret it,'' Abed quoted the caller as saying.   Abed said he was not angered by the threat and that he hadalready decided on a simple ceremony as a sign of respect for thosemourning relatives killed in the uprising.   Another newlywed, Khalil Abu Akar, 27, welcomed the changes,saying they had saved him a lot of money.   Abu Akar said he spent $3,500 on his May wedding and his wife'sdowry, compared with the $15,000 his brother Muayed, a 25-year-oldmechanic, paid when he got married a year ago.   ``Thanks to the glorious uprising, today you can get marriedwithout having to buy your bride,'' said Abu Akar, a junior highschool teacher in Dheishe.   The uprising has not only affected private lives but also hasoverhauled the structure of Palestinian society, said Erakat.   So-called popular committees run by young Palestinians havereplaced traditional community leaders, such as village elders,Moslem preachers and wealthy businessmen.   The committees have organized food distribution to the needy,first aid to those hurt in clashes with soldiers and night patrolsalerting residents to possible army raids.   Young organizers also enforce commercial strikes and summonresidents to participate in marches and demonstrations.   ``The committees are replacing the old authority,'' said Sarawi,who heads a committee organizing aid to families whose members havebeen killed, wounded or imprisoned.   Yusef Salah, 22, a popular committee member in the village of ElKhader near Bethlehem, said the changes were not temporary.   ``We are a born-again people,'' he said. ``We think differentlyand we behave differently.''</TEXT></DOC>
