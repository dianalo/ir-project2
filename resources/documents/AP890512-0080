Also today, a newspaper said Politburo member Hu Qili met withreporters from the China Youth News, many of whom have been activein a journalists' movement for freedom of the press.   The China Youth News reported that Hu, responsible forsupervising China's state-run media, talked with the journalistsThursday in ``a cordial, harmonious and friendly atmosphere.''   It said Hu listened to their opinions, but it gave no detailsabout his reply.   Earlier this week, Chinese journalists gave the government apetition signed by more than 1,000 reporters requesting a dialogueon censorship.   Students have marched from their schools to Tiananmen Squareseven times during nearly monthlong protests for freedom anddemocracy, and about 300 journalists took part in a similardemonstration May 4.   Government spokesman Yuan Mu said he hopes students will notdisrupt the first Sino-Soviet summit in 30 years.   ``I'm sure that the overwhelming majority of the students willproceed from the standpoint of maintaining the political and socialstability in China and act to protect the international prestige ofChina,'' Yuan said.   Leaders of the student campaign for democratic reforms haveindicated they may march to Tiananmen Square in central Beijing onMonday, the day Gorbachev arrives.   ``We have not ruled out a demonstration to express our supportfor political reform,'' one activist said Thursday.   Students at Beijing University by Thursday night had alsogathered 1,200 signatures for an open invitation to Gorbachev tospeak at China's most prestigious university.   Yuan, speaking at a news conference devoted mainly to economicmatters, said if the students do march, ``I think that the correctpolicies and approaches adopted by the Chinese government recentlywill be continued to be pursued.''   The government, after threatening a crackdown and mobilizingtroops early in the campaign, has acted with restraint. There hasbeen no serious attempt to stop the demonstrations and thegovernment has agreed to meet selected students to discuss suchissues as freedom of the press and official corruption.   Activists, however, accuse the government of stalling inresponding to their demands that new independently elected studentgroups be recognized and be given a voice in the dialogue.   In a front-page editorial, the People's Daily, mouthpiece of theCommunist Party, also appealed today for calm and stability butacknowledged complaints by students are real.   ``More and more people have realized that there are problemsexisting in our country, including the problems raised by students.These problems can only be solved under circumstances of stabilityand on the track of democracy and law,'' it said.   Many Beijing students returned to classes this week after tensof thousands demonstrated on May 4th, the 70th anniversary ofChina's first democratic movement. However, large numbers ofstudents at Beijing University and other schools have continuedtheir strike.   Yuan said the government is discussing the draft of a law on theholding of demonstrations.   Yuan said details of the law have yet to be worked out, but``that law will be designed to both protect the exercise of civilrights of citizens and at the same time protect social and stateinterests.''   China's constitution guarantees the right to demonstrate, butsince large student demonstrations in 1986-87 most Chinese citieshave passed regulations stating that planned street marches mustfirst receive the approval of local police.   Police, citing traffic problems, rarely approve applications fordemonstrations and all the student rallies over the past month havebeen technically illegal.</TEXT></DOC>
