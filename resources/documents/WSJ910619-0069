Fife Jr.left Cross andamp; Trecker Corp. in a huff when top managementresisted his efforts to revamp the machinetool maker'sKearney andamp; Trecker unit. He took a job here as chief executiveof Giddings andamp; Lewis Inc., a smaller, struggling rival.   Last week, Mr. Fife was vindicated: Cross andamp; Trecker, withannual sales of $431 million, agreed to be acquired byGiddings andamp; Lewis, with sales of only $243 million, making Mr.Fife's company the largest American tool maker.</LP><TEXT>   Such a David and Goliath tale would have seemed improbablewhen Mr. Fife first switched companies. But that was beforeGiddings andamp; Lewis reversed heavy losses to produce fourstraight years of profits, as sales jumped 94%. Moreover, Mr.Fife expects the company to post record earnings of 50cents-54 cents a share in the current quarter.   Meanwhile, Cross andamp; Trecker, of Bloomfield Hills, Mich.,was overrun by foreign competition and posted a loss in eachof the last four years as sales stagnated. &quot;When you're notready to make changes, they just don't happen,&quot; Mr. Fifesays.   Wall Street wonders why Giddings andamp; Lewis stooped to pickup Cross andamp; Trecker. In the three days following theannouncement, Giddings shares dropped $2.875 a share, or 12%,to $21.25 a share in heavy over-the-counter trading. Theyclosed at $22.125 a share yesterday, up 62.5 cents.   Still, Mr. Fife points out that the acquisition givesGiddings andamp; Lewis an entry into the automotive market and intoEurope and Asia, where it has little presence now. Also, Mr.Fife figures he can overcome Cross andamp; Trecker's managementmiscues by integrating its operations into a cohesive unit.   But not without cost. Giddings, which had a debt-freebalance sheet, will see debt rise to 35% of capitalization.The purchase will cost Giddings andamp; Lewis $70.7 million in cashand common stock and an additional $54 million in preferredshares, and will dilute shareholders' equity. &quot;Fife has hadexperience turning companies around, but this is going to bemuch more challenging than anything he's done in the past,&quot;notes Steven Colbert, a machinery analyst with PrudentialSecurities.   The acquisition wouldn't surprise those who know Mr. Fife,a 53-year-old street fighter who began as a sweeper in asteel mill. He has since made a career out of turning aroundrust-belt losers by finding new markets, streamliningoperations and cutting deadwood. &quot;These companies are alreadydown, so the only thing left is to go up,&quot; he says.   While playing tackle for Indianapolis's Park High Schoolin a football game in 1954, Mr. Fife lunged forward on thegame's first snap and punched his unsuspecting opponent inthe mouth. &quot;He doesn't go to play, he goes to win,&quot; saysRichard Pidgeon, a former classmate of Mr. Fife's who servedwith him in the Navy after high school and is now Giddings'svice president for purchasing.   That hard-nosed style swept Mr. Fife through an unlikelycareer. In 1958, he got a job sweeping steel chips off thefloor in an Inland Steel Industries plant, from which hewould return to his one-bedroom flat at night to nurse hisbloodied hands. By 1975 he won a job managing a money-losingglass plant for Combustion Engineering Inc. Within a year itwas profitable. Combustion Engineering then sent him torescue its oil-drilling equipment unit in 1980, where Mr.Fife found new customers in the petrochemical and dairyindustries.   Finally Cross andamp; Trecker hired him to perk up its Kearney andamp;Trecker unit, which was losing out to the Japanese. But thecompany wouldn't back his efforts to increase production ofits low-end, commodity-type goods.   Giddings andamp; Lewis did. Mr. Fife recruited half a dozenformer associates from Kearney andamp; Trecker and elsewhere.Within a year, the team had cut costs at Giddings's low-endproducts by 30% and increased sales by five times. Then, hemoved on to the company's high-end manufacturing cells,promoting the concept of highly automated, flexiblemanufacturing systems -- an area where the Japanese don'tcompete. In 1990, Giddings andamp; Lewis reached customers in 45different industries, up from 31 the year earlier; it alsospent a whopping 10% of sales on research and development.   Mr. Fife has succeeded by giving his companies asmall-business feel. A country-music fan who spends his freetime rolling barbed wire on his farm where he hopes to raisehorses, he has instructed his executives to answer their ownphones. He visits the plant floor every day. He knows most ofthe 1,200 workers by first name. He also holds twice-monthly,no-agenda meetings for his executives to carouse over dinnerand beer.   But while the down-home approach has worked for Mr. Fifein this sleepy town of 35,000 on Lake Winnebago, there's noguarantee it will work with Cross andamp; Trecker and its 4,000employees. A hodgepodge of once independent companies such asCross, Kearney andamp; Trecker and Warner andamp; Swasey, the companyhasn't been able to integrate its disparate operations. WhileGiddings andamp; Lewis succeeds by avoiding Japanese competition,Cross andamp; Trecker makes standard machine tools that competehead-on.   Mr. Fife promises &quot;there are going to be some big changesmade,&quot; including the replacement of all Cross andamp; Trecker brandnames with the Giddings andamp; Lewis name. Mr. Fife says he plansto remove Cross andamp; Trecker from fierce competition by usingits cheaper, stand-alone machine tools as part of Giddings andamp;Lewis's manufacturing systems. The company also promises tocut its combined payroll and consolidate operations on a&quot;case-by-case basis.&quot;   &quot;There's going to be a lot of sleepless nights at thebeginning,&quot; Mr. Fife admits. &quot;But this is a fantasticopportunity to give rebirth to an industry that has hadtremendous problems over the years, and we're willing to paythe penalty to do it.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
