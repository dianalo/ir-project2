late in the afternoonof August 16, according to the New York State Police.andM;Senior investigator Donald Delaney said that a 14 year-old student atManhattan's Stuyvesant High School, identified, because of his age, only ashis computer nickname, &quot;Zod,&quot; was the organizer of a gang of hackers thatillegally obtained a C language source program from the City University inBellevue, Washington.andM;Delaney said that the stolen program was developed by ATandamp;T for Unix systemsand has a value of $1.2 million.andP;  Delaney also said that copyrighted computergames were also stolen by the group from the university system.andM;The thirteen persons arrested include five adults and eight juveniles.andP;  Theadults were identified by the police as Cornell University student TeeraweeUnchalipongse, 19, of Staten Island; St. Francis College student AnhtuNguyen, 21 of Brooklyn; Bronx High School of Science student Chai Hung Ling,17, and Bruce Monroe, 32, an unemployed electronics technician, both ofQueens; and Jeff Miller, 21, Franklin Square, N.Y.andP;  The naming of the fiveadults contradicts earlier information given by sources to Newsbytes that allarrested were minors.andM;Special Investigator Delaney told Newsbytes that computers are normallyimpounded in cases of this nature because they are &quot;instrumentalities of thecase just as a weapon would be seized in a robbery arrest.&quot; He said thatinvestigators must now examine all of the hard disks and thousands of floppydisks seized to determine whether they contain telephone numbers andpasswords for signing onto private computer systems.andP;  Additionally, they mustcheck all of the disks to see if they contain copyrighted material.andP;  Theequipment then becomes evidence that is needed for any cases that go totrial.&quot;andM;When asked by Newsbytes what eventually becomes of the equipment, Delaneysaid &quot;Most of these cases concerning hackers' entry into unauthorized areasare usually resolved through plea arrangement with the district attorney thathas jurisdiction for the case.andP;  Usually a condition of the arrangement is asigning over of the equipment to the local police and the destruction of thefloppy disks.&quot;andM;Delaney also told Newsbytes that Zod is a member, possibly the leader, of&quot;Mod,&quot; a group of high school and college hackers that meets monthly in thepublic area of New York City's CitiCorp Center to discuss and plan illegalcomputer activities.andP;  He said that members of this group had beeninvestigated for a number of hacker-related crimes and that Zod himself is asuspect in an electronic break-in into a Pentagon-based Air Force computer.andO;Delaney said that this connection became apparent when the New York Stateinvestigation crossed lines with one in progress by the Air Force's Office ofSpecial Investigations (OSI).andM;Major Steve Headily, the director of public affairs for the Air Force OSIconfirmed to Newsbytes that Zod is a subject in the on-going investigation ofthe Air Force break-in.andP;  Headily also said that, while he couldn't comment onthe details of the investigation, &quot;It should be understood that the Air Forcecomputer system in question is completely and only used for administrativepurposes.andP;  There is no classified material available through this system.&quot;andM;Headily further told Newsbytes, &quot;Although no classified material wasavailable on this system, we look at this as a serious incident both becauseof the act of a break-in and the chance that, should someone amass a largeamount of even non-classified data, a security threat could occur.&quot;andM;Headily said that his office was aware of the New York state action and,while it did not participate in the press conference, &quot;OSI investigatorCharles Kellum is working closely with New York state police personnel.&quot;andM;Headily noted that the Air Force OSI is the only federal agency that has afull time unit dedicated to the investigation of computer-related incidents,&quot;Our investigators are a group of computer professionals that not only getinto cases like this but also cases involving espionage, contractor fraud,e-mail harassment -- anything related to computers.&quot;andM;Newsbytes spoke to one of the minors arrested in the police action and wastold, &quot;I signed on to a BBS and saw a number that was supposedly a publicboard.andP;  I called and downloaded some games and then uploaded a game, NuclearWar, and a virus scanning program.andP;  This is common practice on public boards-- to download software and then to make a contribution by uploading.andP;  Isigned on another time and, while I was on, I got a message 'Who are you?'andO;The computer then said 'This call is being traced.'andM;&quot;I got confused and hung up.andP;  I never called back.andP;  The people who took thecomputer told me that number was the City University in Bellevue,Washington.&quot;andM;In response to a Newsbytes question about what he knew about the possiblereturn of his computer, the minor said, &quot;I asked them when I could have itback and they said 'from a long time to never.' I have to go to court in afew weeks.andP;  I guess I'll find out then.&quot;andM;(Barbara E. McMullen andamp; John F. McMullen/19900817)</TEXT></DOC>
