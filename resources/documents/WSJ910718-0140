Wall Street analysts estimate the nation's largeststeelmakers had losses of $35 to $45 a ton of steel shipped,compared with earnings of $16 a ton a year earlier. JohnJacobson of AUS Consultants said the industry could post aloss of $1 billion in the second quarter, compared withearnings of $500 million a year earlier.</LP><TEXT>   While pricing remains the industry's Achilles' heel,volume was hammered by continued slack orders from theautomotive, appliance and construction industries. Theindustry-wide operating rate remained below 70% for much ofthe second quarter and isn't expected to turn aroundsignificantly until at least the fourth quarter. In fact,Peter Marcus of PaineWebber expects the major steel companiesto be in the red in the second half and in 1992.   The news isn't all bad, however: Second-quarter resultsshould be slightly better than the first-quarter average lossof $50 a ton. Moreover, there are telltale signs that theindustry might have hit bottom: Orders have picked up inrecent weeks and an announced 4% price increase onhigh-volume flat rolled steel effective with Sept. 29shipments could halt price erosion if the price increasesticks. In addition, major steelmakers have nearly completedmassive equipment maintenance programs that have hurtshort-term earnings.   For example, Bethlehem Steel Corp., based in Bethlehem,Pa., had a loss of about 60 cents a share, in contrast withearnings of 21 cents a year earlier. However, the latestquarter included a 40-day outage at the pivotal SparrowsPoint, Md., plant to rebuild a hot strip mill. &quot;If it weren'tfor that, Bethlehem would have broken even,&quot; said CharlesBradford, an analyst with UBS Securities Inc.   Bethlehem should outperform its peers, with a loss ofabout $15 a ton. In addition, it could soon eclipsePittsburgh-based USX Corp.'s U.S. Steel Group as the nation'slargest steelmaker, once U.S. Steel closes certain operationsat Fairless Hills, Pa.   USX's results should be better than the $2-a-share loss inthe first quarter, when the company was hurt by prolongedlabor talks that prompted steel customers to seek alternativesuppliers. Christopher Plummer, who monitors the steelindustry for WEFA Group, said he believes USX had a loss ofabout $90 for every ton of steel shipped on an operatingbasis in the first quarter because of the labor talks. U.S.Steel should also benefit from strength in certain steelmarkets such as tin plate used for food cans and seemlesstube products for the energy market.   Losses at Chicago-based Inland Steel Industries Inc.,which instituted wide management shake-ups in the past sixmonths in the face of lackluster results, probably moderatedin the second quarter. Michelle Galanter Applebaum, ananalyst with Salomon Brothers, estimates operating profit inthe company's steel service center business, whichdistributes the steel, reached $10 million, compared with $6million in the first quarter. Still, she expects the companyhad a loss of about $1.30 a share, in contrast to earnings of42 cents a share a year ago, because of continued start-upcosts from the I/N Tek continuous cold rolling plant nearSouth Bend, Ind.; an average price decline on hot-rolledsheet of $50 a ton from the first quarter, and aggressiveinventory reduction.   Meanwhile, smaller steel makers and minimills, which usescrap to make steel, likely were profitable in the secondquarter, albeit at lesser levels than a year ago.   John Tumazos, with Donaldson Lufkin andamp; Jenrette Securities,estimates Charlotte, N.C.-based Nucor Corp. earned 50 cents ashare, compared with 87 cents a year earlier. On a per-sharebasis, specialty steelmakers Allegheny Ludlum Corp.,Pittsburgh, and Worthington Industries Inc., Columbus, Ohio,probably earned 40 cents and 31 cents, respectively, comparedwith 68 cents and 48 cents a year earlier. Mr. Tumazos saidthe second-tier steelmakers have less debt, interest,depreciation and overhead costs than their largercompetitors.</TEXT></DOC>
