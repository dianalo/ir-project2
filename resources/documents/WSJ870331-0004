Garcia</HL><DD> 03/31/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> STOCK MARKET, OFFERINGS (STK)STOCK INDEXES (NDX) </IN><TEXT>   Stock prices plummeted yesterday amid growing concerns about an accelerating slide of the dollar and the possibility of higher inflation and interest rates.    At the opening bell, Wall Street was flooded with sell orders from foreign investors and many individual investors in the U.S. The Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged more than 80 points in the first 40 minutes of trading.    The industrial average finished down 57.39 at 2278.41, the third largest single-day decline in points. Standard andamp; Poor's 500-stock index fell 6.93 to 289.20, and the New York Stock Exchange composite index dropped 3.81 to 164.56.    The heavy influx of sell orders and resulting order imbalances forced delayed openings in trading of many active bluechip stocks such as International Business Machines, Merck, Minnesota Mining andamp; Manufacturing and Exxon. IBM, arguably one of the most liquid stocks in the world, opened almost an hour late.    &quot;We had a classic day of panic. It was no fun,&quot; said Alfred Goldman, a technical analyst with A.G. Edwards andamp; Sons in St. Louis. For many traders and analysts, the severity of the sell-off was quite a surprise. By the close, there were 1,522 decliners on the Big Board and just 222 advancers.    The worst of the selling came in the morning, largely because many Japanese and European investors want their orders executed on the opening.    A decline in the dollar was generally welcomed by many investors until last week because it would help narrow the U.S. trade deficit and boost profits for multinational firms. But by late last week, investors' perception of the dollar's decline began to change as it slipped to a new post-war low against the yen, and its fall was hardly slowed by massive central bank intervention.    &quot;There's a huge difference between the effects of an unmanaged decline in the dollar and the perceptions of a managed decline,&quot; said William Gillard, director of investment policy at Kidder Peabody in New York. He said that until last week, investors believed that the U.S. and the central banks of its major trading partners were managing the dollar's slide. Now it seems &quot;unmanaged. No one knows where the bottom might be. (Investors) are afraid of this leg&quot; of the dollar's fall, he said.    The weaker dollar &quot;is a two-edged sword,&quot; said Gerald Simmons, a managing director at Smith Barney Harris Upham. How investors react to the dollar's slide depends on the &quot;mood of the market,&quot; he said, noting that investors are now worried the Federal Reserve might have to tighten its credit policy to stem the dollar's drop, and that the resulting higher interest rates will choke any gains in economic activity.    Mr. Gillard added that planned tariffs on Japanese electronics imports pit two of the largest economies in the world against each other and &quot;add a destabilizing factor&quot; to global commerce. The chance of a trade war could disrupt the profit growth that many stock investors have been anticipating for this year, he added.    Fred Lange, president of Lange Financial Services, said many investors were reluctant to take profits all through the first quarter. He believes the concern about the dollar, the news of tariffs being imposed on Japanese microchip exporters and worries about inflation and higher rates &quot;became an excuse to sell.&quot;    IBM traded as low as 146 yesterday morning, but it closed at 152 3/8, up 1 5/8 for the day. Traders said the stock rallied on expectations for the new generation of personal computers that IBM will unveil Thursday. The company is unleashing a massive advertising campaign to promote the new machines and is aggressively wooing dealers.    Microsoft, which jointly developed two new personal computer operating systems, is also basking in IBM's limelight. The stock closed up 5 at 96 3/4 in the over-the-counter market, after trading as low as 88 1/2.    Texas Instruments, which rose 1 1/8 to 183 1/8, avoided the selling frenzy that gripped many other stocks. The stock was buoyed by expectations that the company might benefit from the planned tariffs on the Japanese electronics companies and several bullish recommendations from Wall Street analysts.    Other technology stocks weren't so fortunate. Digital Equipment dropped 4 1/8 to 157, Motorola fell 1 5/8 to 53 3/8, Unisys declined 3 1/8 to 96 5/8 and Honeywell lost 2 1/2 to 70 1/8.    Drug stocks were among the biggest losers in the sell-off. Interest-rate sensitive issues such as utilities, banks, insurance and thrift stocks tumbled as bond yields jumped in the credit markets. Of the 30 stocks that make up the Dow Jones Industrial Average, 26 declined and 4 advanced.    Gold stocks enjoyed a run-up as investors worried about inflation eagerly sought out these issues.    Stocks of Japanese companies, traded as American depositary receipts in the U.S., continued the decline that was started in the Tokyo market early yesterday. Hitachi dropped 4 1/4 to 60 1/8, Kyocera fell 4 1/4 to 48 1/2, Matsushita declined 9 7/8 to 97 1/4, Sony lost 1 to 19 1/4, Honda Motor slid 3 3/8 to 85 1/8 and TDK fell 3 3/4 to 39.    Some stocks managed to advance yesterday, most of them associated with takeovers, mergers or restructurings.    Harper andamp; Row jumped 8 3/8 to 64 1/8 on news that the publisher has agreed to be acquired by the U.S. subsidiary of Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. for $300 million.    Purolator Courier gained 3/8 to 35 1/2. An investor group is seeking to block a pending $268 million leveraged buyout of the company, asserting that another offer might come.    Santa Fe Southern Pacific moved up 1 7/8 to 38 in active trading. Henley Group said it owns 7.9 million Santa Fe shares.    Taft Broadcasting advanced 1 3/4 to 156 1/2. An investor group, including Robert M. Bass of Forth Worth, Texas, said it has been involved in talks about participating in a group to acquire control of the company.    Borg-Warner jumped 2 7/8 to 47 1/8 in active trading. Friday, GAF raised its stake in Borg-Warner to 19.9% and a tender offer for the remaining shares is expected, traders said.    Penn Central rose 1 1/2 to 56 1/4. The company is mulling the possibility of spinning off all or a portion of its Sprague Electric and its other electronics units.    SciMed Life Systems moved up 3 1/2 to 27 1/2 in OTC trading.    Bristol-Myers agreed to acquire the company in a stock swap. Bristol-Myers fell 1 5/8 to 100 1/4 in heavy trading, taking a beating with many other drug stocks. </TEXT></DOC>
