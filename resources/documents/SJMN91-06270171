One crew member gushed about a future when humans will become&quot;custodians of our world.&quot;;   &quot;Today we gather at a new instrument . . . toexplore the mysteries of our very own home planet,&quot; Bass said, as the crewmembers, wearing futuristic black uniforms, fought to contain their emotions.;  Crew member Abigail Alling, 31, her voice quavering, evoked the sometimesmystical bent of Biosphere 2's organizers: &quot;By necessity, we biospherians walkin as custodians of our world and bring past and future together.&quot;;   At 8:18a.m., the four men and four women of the crew exchanged quick hugs and kisseswith relatives and project officials, stepped through an air-lock door, wavedthrough the round window, and disappeared inside the 3.15-acre geodesic-framedcompound.;   &quot;I have had a vision that man could change from being adesert-maker into a builder of oases,&quot; crew member Mark Nelson said beforestepping through the air lock.;   Biosphere 2 consists of several climaticzones -- rain forest, savanna, ocean and marsh -- packed with 3,800 plant andanimal species. It's all part of a test of space-colonization technology withthe dream of someday locating such a complex on Mars.;   The ultra-moderncomplex includes such luxury items as computers, facsimile machines,telephones, televisions, videocassette recorders and exercise equipment. Thecommunications apparatus will tie the crew into a control center located a fewhundred yards away, and to the rest of the world.;   Critics say the projecthas little scientific merit. It has forged ahead despite doubts over itsauthenticity, charges of cultism and the loss of several of its prominentconsultants.;   &quot;The guise of science has fallen over time,&quot; said YvonneClearwater, an environmental psychologist at the NASA Ames Research Center atMoffett Field. &quot;It's really turning out to be a tourist attraction.&quot;;   SpaceBiospheres Ventures, developer of the private, for-profit project, expects todraw up to a million visitors annually and has applied for some 50 designpatents.;   &quot;Fundamentally, we are a business,&quot; Bass said. &quot;Our first name'Space' draws upon the most dramatic applications for the technologies we aredeveloping.&quot;;   The crew members, ranging in age from 27 to 67, will raisetheir own food and recycle all air, water and wastes. Wednesday theycelebrated a final day of freedom with diversity by attending an ecologicalseminar, a laser show, a cocktail party and a press conference.;   The45-minute closing ceremony after dawn today included prayers from a Tibetanmonk and a sun dance by Dan Old Elk, a Sioux from Montana who presented eachcrew member with a braided sprig of sweet grass from Canada.;   Alling, anative of New York, said before the experiment began that she expects lifeinside Biosphere 2 to be &quot;much like a ship setting sail for the open sea.&quot;;  &quot;You're out there, and whatever you have on board and whoever is with you onboard is who you've got, and you've got to make it through whatever comes up,&quot;she said.;   The four-man, four-woman group has two people from England, onefrom Belgium and five from the United States.;   Each crew member is likely tospend about four hours daily on farming and other chores to maintain thecomplicated machinery driving the Biosphere. Another four hours a day will goto scientific work.;   Sex has not been ruled out among the crew members, butnone of the four women plans a pregnancy.;   Mark van Thillo, 30, of Belgiumsaid he would miss his country's chocolates, while Taber McCallum, 27, ofAlbuquerque, N.M., said he'll regret not &quot;sailing on the open ocean and theopen sky.&quot;;   The crew is hoping to stay inside for two years, barring seriousillness or other calamity.;   But Margret Augustine, president and chiefexecutive officer of the project, said problems could crop up after a month orso that would require the crew to leave temporarily before returning for asolid two years. And a person could leave if he or she suffered from extremepsychological pressure, she said.;   'It's not a prison,&quot; she said.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Mercury News Staff and Wire reports  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Oracle, Ariz.  </CITY><EDITION>  Stock Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910926  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Thursday  </DAY><MONTH>  September  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  814  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Thursday, September 26, 199100270171,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENGFRONT  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
