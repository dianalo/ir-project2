Ramosasked the Reagan administration Monday to accelerate military aidto his country but avoided any discussion about the fate of U.S.bases there, Pentagon officials said Monday.   Ramos met for several hours with Defense Secretary Frank C.Carlucci and Adm. William Crowe, chairman of the Joint Chiefs ofStaff.   According to one official who attended the meetings, Ramosoffered ``an in-depth report on some of the gains made by the(Philippine) military and some of the problems they still face'' infighting communist insurgents.   ``It was kind of a report card, with a request to accelerate themilitary aid that has already been promised,'' added the source,who agreed to discuss the matter only if not identified. ``Hedidn't raise the issue of the (U.S.) bases. He said that was amatter for the appointed negotiators and not him.''   U.S. and Philippine teams are now meeting in Manila to reviewagreements allowing U.S. military bases in the country. Philippineofficials have talked about huge increases in what the UnitedStates pays for use of the bases _ now about $180 million a year.   The Pentagon official said Ramos had specifically asked thatefforts be quickened to supply his army with 20 armed observationhelicopters, already promised by the administration.   ``He also asked to accelerate funds for military education,''the source said.   Ramos ``discussed his budget problems, his equipment problemsand the restructuring of the military'' in the wake of various coupattempts against Philippines President Corazon Aquino, a secondofficial said.   ``He expressed his thanks for the military assistance given overthe past year and asked for continued support,'' the official said.   Ramos, a West Point graduate who became authoritarian rulerFerdinand Marcos' No. 2 military commander and then helped lead theFebruary 1986 revolution that overthrew him, is making a 10-dayvisit to the United States that includes meetings with Carlucci,Secretary of State George P. Shultz, other officials and members ofCongress.   His message, according to Philippine government spokesman BenDavid, is that his country cannot overcome the communist threatwith military force alone but still needs more military aid.   ``We are now on the upgrade. We have gotten out of the very deephole where we found ourselves in February 1986,'' Ramos told amostly Filipino-American gathering Saturday night in the Washingtonarea.   But he said the country still faces serious problems, includingpoverty, social injustice, the need for land reform and bettereducation.   Ramos said new reforms and the failure of communist-supportedcandidates in elections have helped limit growth of the insurgencythat arose during Marcos' 20-year rule.   But he said the communist rebels are still a significant force,with up to 23,000 fighters, about two-thirds of whom are armed. Hesaid that number has changed little since President Corazon Aquinocame to power.</TEXT></DOC>
