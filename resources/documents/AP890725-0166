The measure represents the latest round of a struggle betweenveterans' advocates, who say the government is ignoring evidenceabout the deadly herbicide, and government scientists, who say noclear cause and effect can be established.   ``This legislation takes the important breakthrough step increating a presumption that certain conditions, if developed in anindividual after exposure, are presumed related to that exposureand are our country's responsibility _ not a burden of thatconflict to be borne in tragic isolation by the veteran,'' saidRep. David E. Skaggs, D-Colo., a Marine veteran of Vietnam and oneof 60 co-sponsors of the bill.   The bill, introduced by Reps. Lane Evans, D-Ill., and MartinLancaster, D-N.C., allows veterans to be compensated longer and formore diseases than a version that has cleared the Senate Veterans'Affairs Committee.   Under the House bill, costing about $40 million a year, veteranswith non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, soft-tissue sarcoma, melanoma andbasal cell carcinoma would be eligible for permanent disabilitybenefits. So would their survivors.   The bill would also establish a presumption of serviceconnection for any Vietnam veteran with chloracne, a skincondition, provided it occurred within a year of service.   The Senate bill, covering only soft tissue sarcoma andnon-Hodgkins lymphoma, would provide benefits until April 15, 1992.   The House and Senate bills would both require extensiverecord-keeping based on health reports and tissue samples fromveterans. Both would ask the National Academy of Sciences to reviewscientific studies on Agent Orange exposure every two years, withthe Department of Veterans Affairs making its benefitsdeterminations based on those reviews.   Veterans are already allowed to receive outpatient and hospitalcare for illnesses presumed to be linked to Agent Orange.   The Senate passed an Agent Orange bill last year but the measurenever emerged from the House Veterans' Affairs Committee.   Rep. G.V. ``Sonny'' Montgomery, D-Miss., chairman of the Housecommittee, and the senior minority member, Rep. Bob Stump, R-Ariz.,sent their colleagues a three-page letter Tuesday calling the newlyintroduced bill ``premature at best.''   They cited an ongoing study by the Centers for Disease Controlon the incidence of selected cancers among Vietnam-era veterans,due for completion next spring. They also cited a federal courtorder to change the criteria used to evaluate Agent Orange studiesand the recent creation of a U.S. Court of Veterans Appeals toreview claims.   But supporters of the bill say the CDC and VA have dragged theirfeet in trying to determine whether a link exists between AgentOrange exposure and the various afflictions.   CDC was accused in a House Government Operations subcommitteehearing two weeks ago of botching or rigging its Agent Orange studyto fail. CDC contends it dropped a massive study of Agent Orangeexposure because there was no way to tell who was exposed.   About 12 million gallons of the herbicide wre sprayed during thewar to remove the lush foliage that provided ground cover to theenemy. Agent Orange contains dioxin, one of the most toxicchemicals known, as well as 2,4,5-T and 2,4-D, also harmfulchemicals.   An estimated 2.6 million military personnel served within theborders of South Vietnam. About 250,000 have told VA they believethey were exposed, and 35,000 have applied for disability benefits.</TEXT></DOC>
