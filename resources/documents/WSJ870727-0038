Separately, Shell Oil Co.'s net income rose 21%. Occidental Petroleum Corp. reported a 23% profit jump, though the company would have had a loss without a one-time item. Phillips Petroleum Corp.'s profit, meanwhile, plunged 63% amid weak natural gas prices. And Pennzoil Co.'s net income tumbled 71%, largely from a one-time charge.    Exxon Corp.   Exxon's revenue rose 12%, to $20.2 billion from $18 billion. Buoyed by higher crude-oil prices, earnings from the company's exploration and production operations rose 65%, to $886 million from $536 million.    However, earnings from Exxon's world-wide refining and marketing business, battered by depressed refined-product margins, plunged to $19 million from $566 million in the year-earlier quarter. And its U.S. refining operations posted a $19 million loss compared with a gain of $197 million a year earlier.    &quot;The improvement in exploration and production earnings proved insufficient to cover the deterioration in refining and marketing,&quot; said Lawrence G. Rawl, Exxon chairman.    Exxon's earnings may presage second-quarter results of other major international oil companies, analysts said, with weak refining and marketing operations offsetting gains in exploration and production. Chevron Corp. and Mobil Corp., for instance, likely will follow a similar pattern, analysts said. Refining and marketing businesses typically trail recoveries in exploration and production because they must pay higher crude prices before the increased costs are passed through to the consumer.    The pattern contrasted with last year, when crude-oil prices plunged. &quot;A year ago, oil companies benefited from the retail lag in passing through declining crude-oil prices to the consumer,&quot; said Barry Good, an oil analyst at Morgan Stanley Group in New York. &quot;This year they're suffering from the reverse side of not being able to recover higher crude costs in the refined-product market.&quot;    Some analysts suggested that refining and marketing operations would improve next quarter. &quot;Refining profitability likely will improve a bit in the third quarter as spot prices ease a bit,&quot; said Brian Jacoboski, an oil analyst at PaineWebber Inc. in New York. Crude oil contracts for September delivery at the New York Mercantile Exchange plunged 66 cents, to $20.57 a barrel, on Friday. Last year, crude oil prices had fallen below $10 a barrel.    Exxon's results were bolstered by strong chemical earnings, which soared 83% to a record $225 million from $123 million a year earlier. Firm demand and improved profit margins triggered the gains, the company said, as well as one-time tax adjustments. Company officials said all segments continue to benefit from cost savings and &quot;operating efficiencies&quot; produced by last year's restructuring.    For the six months, net income fell 21% from the year earlier, as revenue slipped 2%, to $39.6 billion from $40.2 billion.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday, Exxon fell 12.5 cents, to $92.875.    Shell Oil Co.   Shell, a unit of Royal Dutch/Shell Group, attributed the 21% rise in second-quarter profit to crude-oil prices, chemical margins and sales volumes of both refined products and chemicals. Revenue increased 24%, to $5.18 billion from $4.16 billion.    For the six months, Shell's profit fell 24% as revenue rose 9.6%, to $9.68 billion from $8.83 billion. Shell attributed the profit decline to lower natural-gas prices and sharply narrower refined-product margins.    In the quarter, Shell's profit from oil and gas exploration and production more than quadrupled, to $152 million from $37 million the year before. That was offset, however, by a steep decline in second-quarter profit from oil products, to $56 million from $146 million. Profit from the chemical products division in the quarter rose 33%, to $101 million from $76 million.    Occidental Petroleum   Without an $81 million one-time gain from the sale of oil property in Colombia, Los Angeles-based Occidental would have reported a loss for the quarter instead of a 23% increase in net. The year-earlier period included $35 million in gains from the sale of oil and gas properties.    Sales rose 13%, to $4.33 billion from $3.83 billion.    Bolstered by one-time gains from the sale of oil properties, Occidental's profit from oil and gas operations jumped 29%, to $126 million after-tax from $98 million a year earlier.    Agriculture and food-related operations posted an 11% drop in after-tax profit, to $17 million. Natural-gas transmission profit fell 14%, to $71 million. Profit from chemical operations more than doubled, to $51 million.    For the six months, Occidental's net income rose 28%. The results include one-time gains of $103 million from the sales of chemical operations, $20 million from tax credits, and the $81 million gain from the sale of oil property. The year-earlier period includes one-time gains of $68 million from the sale of oil and gas interests. Sales increased 14%, to $8.49 billion from $7.49 billion.    Occidental shares closed unchanged at $37 Friday in Big Board composite trading.    Phillips Petroleum   Still struggling with reduced crude-oil production and lower natural gas prices, Bartlesville, Okla.-based Phillips posted a 63% plunge in net income for the quarter as revenue grew 13%, to $2.64 billion from $2.34 billion last year. Last year's second-quarter results included a $54 million charge for work-force reductions and a $10 million gain from asset sales.    Some analysts said the results may force them to lower their 1987 earnings projection for Phillips as higher oil prices and strong profit in the chemicals business don't seem to be enough to pull the company from its slump.    For the six months, Phillips posted a loss of $29 million as revenue fell 5%, to $5.18 billion from $5.45 billion a year earlier.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday, Phillips fell 62.5 cents, to $16.75.    Pennzoil Co.   Pennzoil attributed its 71% profit plunge in the quarter to lower refining margins, compared with the record levels of a year earlier, and to lower sales prices and volumes in the sulfur segment. Revenue dropped 8.5%, to $443.2 million from $484.5 million.    For the six months, Houston-based Pennzoil's net income more than doubled from the year-earlier period, when the company took large write-downs on the value of its oil and gas properties. Six-month revenue fell 11%, to $887.9 million from $998.2 million.    Second-quarter operating profit from the petroleum products division fell 26%, to $30.6 million. The sulfur segment fell 51%, to $16.7 million. Operating profit from oil and gas production surged 90%, to $9.7 million.    Second-quarter earnings reflect a $10 million charge for unrealized losses on short-term securities. Pennzoil said that depending on future market performance, the recovery of market value of these securities could mitigate this loss.    In composite trading on the Big Board Friday, Pennzoil rose 12.5 cents, to $74.50.    ---                             1987            1986                          in       per    in       per    %                       millions   share millions  share  chg                     SECOND-QUARTER NET INCOME    Exxon ............. 1,150      1.61  1,115     1.55 +  3    Occidental ......... a-59    c-0.23   b-48   c-0.18 + 23    Pennzoil ............ d-7.4  d-0.08     25.2   0.51 - 71    Phillips .............. 3         e    f-8     0.01 - 63    Shell ............... 266         e    219        e + 21                       FIRST-HALF NET INCOME    Exxon ............. 2,220      3.11  2,825     3.90 - 21    Occidental ........ a-156    c-0.70  b-122   c-0.59 + 28    Pennzoil ............. 19.4    0.28    g-9     0.03 +116    Phillips .......... h-(29)      xxx  i-104   g-0.39  xxx    Shell ............... 374         e    495        e - 24   a-Includes an after-tax gain of $81 million from a paymentin connection with the 1985 sale of an oil and gassubsidiary. b-Includes after-tax gains of $35 million fromthe sale of certain oil and gas properties.
