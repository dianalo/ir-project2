Three of the five principal Democratic presidentialcandidates support some form of the death penalty. That's amajor departure for a party that has prided itself oncompassion -- but has paid a price for the perception that itis &quot;soft&quot; on crime.</LP><TEXT>   The transformation of Democratic presidential politics onthis issue was evident at Sunday's debate in Manchester,N.H., when Gov. Bill Clinton, Sen. Bob Kerrey and former Sen.Paul Tsongas tripped over each other to express support forcapital punishment. Mr. Clinton even interrupted theproceedings to assert that he had twice sent multiplemurderers to their deaths.   Both former Gov. Jerry Brown and Sen. Tom Harkin opposethe death penalty. But the three other candidates' eagernessto associate themselves with a position the party hasconsidered anathema reflects the Democrats' desire to changepublic perceptions, especially on such emotional issues ascrime.   Veteran Democrats like Walter Mondale believe that, as aresult, the Democrats could for the first time in ageneration select a nominee who supports capital punishment.&quot;There is a deep feeling among Democrats that we're losingthese presidential elections by allowing the Republicans toappear tougher on social issues,&quot; says the former vicepresident, the Democrats' 1984 nominee. He said the rush toembrace the death penalty saddened him, but he added, &quot;I'vebeen saddened by how the Republicans have been able to occupythe ground that they're tough and that we don't care aboutissues of middleclass sensitivity.&quot;   It was precisely that image that the three Democrats triedto annul in the Sunday debate.   Gov. Clinton is the strongest supporter of the deathpenalty; indeed, an execution of a convicted police killer isscheduled for Friday in Arkansas. Mr. Kerrey has voted forthe death penalty for crimes of terrorism and in casesinvolving drug kingpins; he also has expressed support of thedeath penalty in a brutal killing of a policeman in Nebraska.Mr. Tsongas supports capital punishment for what he describesas &quot;crimes against society,&quot; which include &quot;large-scale drugdealers.&quot;   In the Manchester debate, the two other candidatesassailed capital punishment. Mr. Brown argued against &quot;aworld where we are killing people&quot; to solve social ills. Mr.Harkin asserted there is &quot;no credible evidence to show it'sany kind of deterrent to crime,&quot; adding, &quot;In the civilizedworld, we are with South Africa, the Soviet Union, Cuba,Libya and places like that that still have capitalpunishment. All the rest of the civilized world has reallydone without it.&quot;   Republicans repeatedly have painted the Democrats as weakon communism and crime. The Cold War is over, but crimeremains. But the new attention to the death penalty alsoraises the prospect of a bloody fight inside the Democraticparty. &quot;Obviously they're pandering in the mainstream forvotes,&quot; says Jeffrey Hart, New Hampshire co-chairman ofPatrick Buchanan's GOP presidential campaign. &quot;But when theyget to that zoo in the convention in New York, there may be aconfrontation.&quot;   The Democrats' political isolation on the issue has longtroubled party thinkers. The subject was a highlight of atalk that William Galston, a University of Maryland politicalscientist who has advised many Democrats (including Gov.Clinton), delivered to the Democratic Leadership Council in1989. Mr. Galston told the group, which has worked to movethe Democrats from the left, that the party suffered becauseit retained its opposition to the death penalty while thevast majority of the American people supported it and didn'tunderstand leading Democrats' arguments against it.   Indeed, one of the Republicans' most potent weapons intheir efforts to undercut Democratic nominee MichaelDukakis's record in 1988 was a television advertisementfeaturing Willie Horton, a murderer serving life withoutparole in Massachusetts who, after failing to return toprison from a furlough in 1986, was arrested and charged withassault of a Maryland couple. &quot;Willie Horton taught{Democrats} that softness doesn't pay,&quot; says Ernest van denHaag, a retired professor of jurisprudence at FordhamUniversity and a contributing editor of the National Review,the conservative journal.   Democratic presidential contenders' support of capitalpunishment makes some party members uneasy because itsuggests that candidates are willing to drift away from theparty's traditional viewpoints and policy anchors.   &quot;It can't be by happenstance that there are Democratsrunning away from poverty issues and speaking about race inmuted tones,&quot; says Christopher Edley Jr., a Harvard lawschool professor who was issues director in the Dukakiscampaign four years ago. &quot;They have bought this thesis aboutthe party's dangerous drift away from the so-calledheartland. They don't want the Democrats to be the party forAfrican-Americans, poor people and civil liberties anymore,but {want it to be} for middle-class, white males andtaxpayers and crime victims.&quot;   Other Democrats argue that the death penalty can cureneither the social ills of the U.S. nor the political ills ofthe Democrats. &quot;The politics of criminal justice is pushingpeople in harsher directions, but the big problem with crimeand political campaigns is that we're pushed in directionsthat make us feel good but not do good,&quot; says PhillipHeymann, who headed the criminal division of the JusticeDepartment in the Carter administration.   Presidential contenders aren't the only Democrats lookinganew at their opposition to the death penalty. &quot;There's a newquality of violence in society today,&quot; says David Lillehaug,a prominent Minnesota Democrat who now supports the deathpenalty. &quot;People are re-examining positions they once held.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
