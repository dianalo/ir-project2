The purpose ofthe guidelines is to provide a general approach and framework for carryingout human and nonhuman exposure assessments for specific pollutants.The purpose of the document is to present criteria that provide a meansfor selecting the most-appropriate mathematical model(s) for conductingan exposure assessment related to ground-water contamination. Generalguidelines and principles for model-selection criteria are presentedfollowed by a step-by-step approach to identifying the appropriate model(s)for use in a specific application. Two site-specific example problemsare provided to demonstrate the procedure for selecting the appropriatemathematical model for a particular application.</TEXT></DOC>
