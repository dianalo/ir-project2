RUBIN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Consumer advocate Ralph Nader on Fridaydenounced a proposed 30 percent pay raise for federal judges andcriticized Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist for leading the drivefor higher pay.   Rehnquist's warning that the current pay levels are a seriousthreat to the judiciary is ``among the most exaggerated remarks everuttered by a chief justice,'' Nader said.   He said few judges are leaving the bench and current pay is nobarrier to attracting talented law school professors and the vastmajority of lawyers who make less than federal judges.   Less than 1 percent of federal judges have resigned since 1974because of the pay or any other reason, Nader added.   ``That's too low an attrition rate given the number of judges whoare indolent or less than competent,'' he said. `You would want ahigher attrition rate actually.''   Rehnquist made a highly unusual personal appeal Wednesday for apay hike, calling the current situation ``the most serious threat tothe future of the judiciary and its continued operations that I haveobserved.''   Court personnel said the only other instances in which justiceshave held news conferences in the Supreme Court building were toannounce their retirement.   Nader said Rehnquist has lent his prestige to ``a pretty mundanelobbying effort'' unsupported by evidence.   ``The chief justice has a right to speak out,'' Nader said. ``Buthe is not being held to a standard'' of proof that supports hardshipclaims.   Rehnquist proposed increasing annual salaries for federal trialjudges from $89,500 to $116,350, and from $95,000 to $123,000 forappeals court judges. The plan would hike the chief justice's yearlypay from $115,000 to $149,500 and raise the salary of other highcourt justices from $110,000 to $143,000.   Congress on Feb. 7 rejected a 51 percent pay hike for itself,federal judges and high-ranking government officials.   Nader said Rehnquist's remark that federal judges require higherpay ``so they'll be able to educate their kids'' is ``the essence ofelitism.''   Nader said if Rehnquist is correct then President Bush ``shoulddeclare a national economic emergency'' for all parents whose pay isless than $90,000 a year.   Nader also disputed Rehnquist's assertion that judicial salariesare not keeping pace with inflation.   More than half the federal judges were appointed since 1979 andtheir pay raises since then exceed the inflation rate, Nader said.   He also said the anger of judges who see young lawyers being paidmore than them is misdirected.   ``Why are these young lawyers paid so much?'' Nader said.``Because of billing abuses by the big corporate law firms'' thatemploy them.</TEXT></DOC>
