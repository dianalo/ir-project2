Professor Turns Up a New Culprit&quot;) referring to Prof. Marc Galanter of the University of Wisconsin School of Law fails to mention the most important reason for increased lawsuit filings. It is simply the inescapable fact that the more affluent a society becomes the more focused are rights to property and the protection of those rights.    In a free society the right to property, i.e. money, is jealously guarded, as it should be. That &quot;right&quot; opens the door to the accumulation of property by an ever-increasing proportion of the population through various means. Of course those means are not always apparent, for they may be the enforcement of a right to employment, to receive work-related benefits, or to transfer payments such as welfare from a state or the federal government. The only thing worse than being poor is to have no money.    Increased expectations of wealth pervade our society, and if a jury perceives a wrong the law will always rise to the occasion and provide a remedy. Unfortunately a severely handicapped personal-injury victim cannot be mended by the law; accordingly, the law provides for money as the common denominator to award the victim a substitute for impossible physical rehabilitation. Juries apply equitable principles by and large and, they too, rising in personal affluence, increase awards to plaintiffs when the legal tests for recovery have been met.    Increased use of federal courts for contract litigation is a direct reflection of our increased affluence, for it is common knowledge federal courts are perceived (not necessarily justifiably) as the forum to file the &quot;big ones&quot; and most plaintiffs and their lawyers would like to think they file big cases.
