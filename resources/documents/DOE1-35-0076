These studies involveddogs that inhaled {sup 90}SrCl{sub 2}, which is very soluble in bodyfluids; and dogs that inhaled {sup 238}PuO{sub 2}, which is initiallyinsoluble but eventually becomes fragmented and more soluble. Both radionuclideswere deposited in the skeleton after dissolution in the lung and absorptioninto the bloodstream. All dogs in the {sup 90}Sr study are dead, andall living dogs in the {sup 238}Pu study are at least 7 years postexposure.Results from these two studies were compared to determine the relativebiological effectiveness (RBE) of chronic beta and alpha radiation deliveredfrom these two radionuclides. These data also were used to estimate therisk of bone cancer in man by using comparisons with data from the {sup90}Sr-, {sup 239}Pu-, and {sup 226}Ra-injected dogs at the Universityof Utah and data on humans who ingested {sup 226}Ra or were injectedwith {sup 224}Ra. Such comparisons provided a link between studies inlaboratory animals and the available human data. In this way risks ofbone cancer in humans from inhaled plutonium or strontium were estimated,even though currently no human cases of bone cancer are known to haveresulted from the inhalation of either of these radionuclides. 15 refs.,7 figs., 7 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
