Herrington hasannounced a preferred buyer for its Great Plains Coal GasificationPlant in North Dakota in a deal that could mean $1.8 billion forthe government over the next 21 years.   Basin Electric Power Cooperative, based in Bismarck, N.D., wasselected from among nine prospective purchasers who bid for theplant, which was built in the early 1980s and acquired by theEnergy Department in 1985 when its private sponsors defaulted onnearly $1.5 billion in federal loans.   ``Our announcement signals the successful return of a facilityto the private sector after the largest foreclosure in U.S.government history,'' Herrington said at a briefing Friday, almostexactly three years after the department acquired the plant.   ``It turns the further drain on the taxpayer that we faced threeyears ago into a substantial recoupment of the taxpayer's money,''he said.   Basin Electric is a consumer-owned, regional cooperative thatsupplies wholesale electric power to 118 rural electric systems ineight states. It is expected to retain the majority of the morethan 800 employees now operating the plant, the Energy Departmentsaid in a statement.   Before the transfer of title can take place, the EnergyDepartment must forward a detailed description of the sales termsto Congress for a mandated 30-day review.   The offer from Basin Electric ``removes the government fromfuture subsidies and future liabilities,'' Herrington said. ``Wehave an offer that removes the government from competing in thebusiness of producing commercial quantities of fuels, and one thatputs business decisions back in the hands of businessmen.''   The $1.8 billion value to the government, according to thedepartment statement, would be in dollars valued at the time theyare received. The initial cash payment would be approximately $85million.   An additional $105 million would be returned from the project'scash reserve fund, $649 million could result from future profitsharing if energy prices follow projections, $590 million wouldresult from the waiver of some federal tax credits available to theproject, and $367 million would be received as federal income taxes.   The department said the actual value will vary with inflationand gas prices, and the department's views of those factors anddiscount rates gives the Basin Electric offer a current value of$600 million.   In addition to Basin Electric, the department entered seriousnegotiations with two other prospective buyers: the Coastal Corp.,the parent company of one of the original plant owners, and MissionFirst Financial, a subsidiary of Southern California Edison.   The other six companies that submitted offers were: BetaPipeline and Equipment, Inc.; FHN Energy, Inc.; IndustrialEngineering Services; Irving A. Backman; Complete Energy Petroleum,Inc.; and The Three Affiliated Indian Tribes of the Fort BertholdReservation.</TEXT></DOC>
