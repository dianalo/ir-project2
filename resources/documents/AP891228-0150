Criticssay they are the best translations of The Bard yet in Arabic.   It took him 24 years, from 1959 to 1983, to translate``Hamlet,'' ``Coriolanus,'' ``King Lear,'' ``Macbeth,''``Othello,'' ``The Tempest'' and 40 of the sonnets.   Now he says that's it.   ``I wanted to translate all his plays,'' Jabra said in aninterview at his home in a fashionable Baghdad suburb. ``But afterfinishing `The Tempest' I realized it was virtually impossible. I'dnever have the time to do anything else.''   He said ``The Tempest,'' which he completed in 1979, was thetoughest to translate because ``it was deceptively lyrical, whichmakes it very difficult to render in another language.''   ``His translations of Shakespeare and other Western works arevery, very beautiful,'' said Professor Abbas al-Tonsi of theAmerican University in Cairo.   Eisa Abu-Shamsieh, an Arab academic, noted in a literary thesison Jabra that his Shakespeare translations ``as well as scholarlystudies on Shakespeare's works stand as a remarkable contributionto the modern Arabic drama in particular, and literature ingeneral. His accuracy in translation is a characteristic upon whichhis critics agree.''   Jabra, 69, is one of the most prolific and versatile Arabwriters; he is a novelist, poet, essayist, critic and translator aswell as artist.   He has translated Oscar Wilde, Emile Zola, Guy de Maupassant,Chekov, Andre Maurois, Walt Whitman, Dylan Thomas, Ezra Pound,Edith Sitwell and William Faulkner along with many English poetssuch as Shelley, Keats, Dryden and Byron.   ``It took me a year to do `Hamlet,' the first Shakespeare play Itranslated,'' Jabra said.   ``It was an agony and a pleasure,'' he added, sitting in hisstudy lined with books in Arabic, English and French as well aspaintings and sculptures by himself and other Iraqi artists.   ``It was something I'd always wanted to do. I'd had thisambition since I was a young man,'' he explained.   ``Ever since I first read `Julius Ceasar' in Jerusalem when Iwas a boy I'd always wondered if it was possible to makeShakespeare's characters talk in Arabic without losing the force ofhis words in English.''   When he studied at Cambridge University in England, he foundthat Arabic translations of Shakespeare were ``verbally awkward,strangely static.''   So he decided to do his own and found himself immersed in ``thealmost impossible task'' of sustaining the ``same verbal charge,the evocative imagery, sustained metaphors, diversity of rhythm andtone, the eloquence and the word play'' into another language.   Apart from such works as his novel ``Hunters in a NarrowStreet,'' which was originally written in English and published in1960, and several collections of poetry, he has written seven majornovels in Arabic, among them ``The Ship,'' ``The Search For WalidMasoud'' and ``The Other Rooms.''   Professor Tonsi noted: ``Jabra and another novelist,Abdel-Rahman Munir, are considered the only two Arab novelistswhose influence could go beyond that of Naguib Mahfouz,'' who wonthe 1988 Nobel Prize for Literature.   Jabra was born in Bethlehem in pre-1948 Palestine, the son of aChristian farmer who fell on hard times, forcing the family to moveto Jerusalem.   There, Jabra quit school to work as a carpenter and plumber. Buthe continued studying at the Arab College and later went toCambridge. In 1952-54, he studied at Harvard.   He returned to Palestine in 1943 and worked as a teacher inJerusalem before being driven into exile, at the age of 29, whenthe state of Israel was declared.   Exile has been one of the central creative forces of his life,engendering a passion for his Arab heritage and Arab nationalism.He converted to Islam in Baghdad, where he wound up in 1948.   He taught English literature at Baghdad's College of Arts and,he said, ``preached change unashamedly.''   He said he told his students: ``We lost Palestine because we hadconfronted a ruthless force with an outmoded tradition.   ``We had been cheated and betrayed by thousands of years ofdecay. We've been victims of our insane rhetoric.''   Jabra noted as he puffed on his ever-present pipe: ``Change hasto begin with a change of vision, with a new way of looking atthings.''   Jabra's understanding of the West and European literature hascombined with a burning belief, shared by many Arab intellectuals,that the Arab world has to change in all facets of life to surviveand preserve its rich heritage.   The heroes of his novels are generally Arab intellectualsstanding alone, facing up to the unknown and dreaming of change.   Like other Arab writers who have long fought decline anddarkness, Jabra believes he has a special obligation to the youngArab generation, and that as a writer he can do that only throughvision and awareness.   To that end, he now writes exclusively in Arabic.   ``I write not only to renew my own energy, but above all torenew the energy within the new Arab generation,'' he said.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Thursday PMs, Jan. 4</NOTE></DOC>
