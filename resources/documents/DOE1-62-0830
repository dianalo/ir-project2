There is alsoa threat to human health by inhalation of the primary SO/sub 2/ and thesecondary sulfate aerosols which may enhance transport of dissolved SO/sub2/ and acid to the lung. Emissions of SO/sub 2/ lead to the formationof sulfuric acid by chemical reactions in cloud water, in liquid aerosoldroplets, and in the gas phase. H/sub 2/SO/sub 4/ is a strong acid whichimparts an unnaturally high acidity (low pH) to rain and surface waterand may cause ecological damage. The inhalation of SO/sub 2/, eitheralone or in combination with fine H/sub 2/SO/sub 4/ aerosol particles,can cause short-term respiratory irritation and may be partly responsiblefor long-term health effects.</TEXT></DOC>
