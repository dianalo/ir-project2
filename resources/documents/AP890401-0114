(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Defrocked PTL leader Jim Bakker isstaying at a Florida retreat for ministers suffering from emotionaldistress and plans to re-establish his TV ministry while awaitinghis fraud and conspiracy trial, a retreat official said Saturday.   ``We extended an invitation to him,'' said the Rev. John Dawsey,chairman of the board of directors of the Lake George MinistriesRetreat in the tiny community of Lake George, Fla., about 40 mileswest of Daytona Beach.   Dawsey, who is pastor of the Church of God in the nearbycommunity of Salt Springs, Fla., said Bakker arrived Wednesday atthe 30-acre retreat.   Under terms of his bail, he was allowed to travel to Florida. OnFriday, a federal magistrate in Charlotte gave him permission tomove there.   Dawsey would not say whether Bakker's wife, Tammy Faye, or otherfamily members were staying at the retreat.   ``It's a place for ministers to come and rest and recuperate,''Dawsey said in a telephone interview. ``Most pastors that come herehave been hurt or devastated or have emotional problems ordistress.''   Bakker received the go-ahead to move to Florida after U.S.Magistrate Paul Taylor was told Bakker has found a location in LakeGeorge to live and to broadcast the ``Jim and Tammy'' show, atleast temporarily.   The Bakkers had been broadcasting his show from the living roomof their home outside Pineville, N.C., near Charlotte. But theywere told the operation violated Mecklenburg County's zoningordinance and must cease by May 7.   Bakker resigned from the PTL ministry in March 1987 after a 1980tryst with a church secretary, Jessica Hahn, and subsequentpayments to her were revealed. The Assemblies of God later strippedhim of his ministerial credentials, and the PTL ministry filed forprotection under the bankruptcy laws.   In December, Bakker and his former top PTL aide, Richard Dortch,were indicted on mail fraud, wire fraud and conspiracy chargesstemming from a 16-month federal grand jury probe into PTL and itsfund-raising practices.   Bakker, who is free on $50,000 bond, must agree to conditionsoutlined by Taylor, according to court documents obtained by TheCharlotte Observer.   Bakker cannot leave Florida without permission from courtofficials and he must maintain weekly and monthly contact bytelephone and in person with court officials in Jacksonville.   Dawsey said the retreat had no broadcasting facilities andcouldn't comment on where Bakker planned to tape his show.   Neither Bakker nor his attorney could be reached for commentSaturday. Dawsey said Bakker would not take telephone calls at theretreat. There was no answer Saturday at the Charlotte home ofBakker attorney Harold Bender.</TEXT></DOC>
