Nicaragua's embassy in San Salvador issued a statement Mondayrejecting allegations that its diplomats helped leftist Salvadoranguerrillas and were guilty of subversion.   The seven members of the political and military commission ofthe Nicaraguan Resistance, as the Contras call their organization,told a news conference they met earlier Monday with PresidentAlfredo Cristiani of El Salvador.   They conferred Saturday with President Oscar Arias of Costa Ricaand planned meetings Tuesday with presidents Vinicio Cerezo ofGuatemala and Jose Azcona of Honduras.   President Daniel Ortega of Nicaragua and the four other CentralAmerican leaders are to meet Aug. 5-7 in Tela, Honduras, aboutimplementing a Central American peace plan that includes disbandingthe U.S.-supported rebels.   Contra leaders said they want demobilization delayed untilNicaragua's leftist Sandinista government guarantees nationalelections scheduled for Feb. 25 will be honest and fair.   ``Our army must remain intact to act as guarantors of anyaccord'' to make Nicaragua democratic, said Israel Galeano, one ofthe Contra leaders.   Galeano said his commission believed Arias and Cristiani wouldpresent the Contra point of view, ``at least partially,'' at theHonduran summit.   Washington ended military aid to the anti-Sandinista rebels inFebruary 1988, but the Contras continue to receive nonlethalassistance.   The Nicaraguan Embassy statement responded to accusations Fridayby a woman student, arrested on charges of taking part in rebelactivities, who claimed an embassy officer provided Salvadoranguerrillas with money and training.   It described the allegations as part of a campaign to underminethe Central American summit.   Zoila Marroquin, a student at the National University who saidshe had been a member of the Farabundo National Liberation Frontguerrilla organization since 1986, spoke to reporters at TreasuryPolice headquarters. She is being held for sedition.   Ms. Marroquin said Nicaraguan consul Alberto Leal channeledmoney from Nicaragua and its Soviet bloc allies to guerrilla frontsat the university and gave students grants for political andmilitary training in Nicaragua.   The embassy denied any staff members had met with Ms. Marroquin,and declared: ``Her statements lack any element of truth becausethey refer to events that did not occur.''   Cristiani has said he will present evidence at the summit thatNicaragua has supplied weapons to the Salvadoran rebels.   Human rights groups estimate more than 70,000 people have beenkilled since guerrillas began fighting in El Salvador in October1979.</TEXT></DOC>
