Michael Dukakis said Monday he mightauthorize military operations against terrorist base camps if hewins the White House. GOP hopeful Bob Dole taunted Vice PresidentBush for ceasing efforts in South Dakota and Minnesota,battlegrounds for this week's campaign contests.   ``I don't know where George Bush is,'' Dole said in Duluth.``Later today we're going to send him a map of Minnesota so atleast he gets a little idea where it is.''   Bush was in South Carolina and Tennessee, virtually concedingthe South Dakota primary and Minnesota caucuses to his GOP rivals.But he predicted he wouldn't be hurt by that.   ``I think I'm going to be the next president of the UnitedStates,'' the vice president said in Myrtle Beach, S.C.   Dole is heavily favored to win the South Dakota contest. But hesounded less confident of his chances for victory in Minnesota,where former television evangelist Pat Robertson and Rep. Jack Kemphave waged energetic campaigns.   On the Democratic side, Dukakis has invested heavily inMinnesota in hopes of bagging a win outside his New Englandbackyard. He, Rep. Richard Gephardt, Sen. Paul Simon, Sen. AlbertGore Jr. and Jesse Jackson have campaigned heavily in South Dakotaas well.   Gephardt campaigned in South Dakota and Wyoming, while hisspokesman accused Gore of hypocrisy and released a list of what hesaid were switches in position the Tennessee senator has made onissues ranging from abortion to farm policy to spending for the MXmissiles.   That was an attempt to turn the tables on Gore, who hasvigorously attacked Gephardt for switching his position on keyissues.   Dukakis made a brief visit to Washington, where he took part ina National Governors' Association meeting with President Reagan.   He emerged from the session to blast the president'santi-terrorism policy and say the United States would be livingwith the consequences of secret arms sales to Iran for a long time.   ``You never, ever make concessions to terrorism,'' Dukakis said.``If you ever do it, then your policy is worthless.''   He added: ``This is international crime, pure and simple and youfight it the way you fight crime _ with tough police work, witheffective undercover operations, with military operations againstterrorist base camps if necessary.''   Dukakis did not elaborate on what conditions might prompt him toauthorize military operations.   But White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said such talk couldconceivably make life more difficult for a hostage. ``I wouldsimply urge caution on everyone's part, including politicalcandidates,'' he said.   Simon was in Minnesota during the day, invoking the name of thestate's late Sen. Hubert H. Humphrey as he bid to score well in thecaucuses.   The Illinois senator was cheered enthusiastically by a crowd atGustavus Adolphus College in St. Peter, Minn., where he said hewould propose a mutual nuclear test ban treaty with the SovietUnion if elected.   Simon once said he needed to win in either Minnesota or SouthDakota this week to keep his campaign alive, but has since pulledback from that standard. ``I am going to do respectably,'' he said,adding he believes the Democratic race will stay muddled beyond theMarch 8 round of contests _ mostly in Southern and border states _known as Super Tuesday.   In Washington, financial reports filed with the Federal ElectionCommission showed Bush's campaign with the biggest bankroll _ $9million _ going into the Super Tuesday primaries. Among Democratichopefuls, Dukakis led with $4 million on hand.   Robertson reported $5.5 million in loans and contributions of$1.3 million during January, in addition to the $6.5 million he gotin federal matching funds. Robertson had earlier said he might notuse the matching funds because he was philosophically opposed tothe public financing system.   He ended the month with $5.5 million in cash on hand, secondonly to Bush's warchest, but Robertson had an outstanding debt of$6 million. Robertson's campaign did not immediately return callsMonday evening to answer questions about where he got the loan orwhat it was for.   With most of the campaign still to go, Bush had spent $10.7million against the $27 million campaign limit, compared withKemp's $12.8 million and Dole's $13.5 million. Robertson reportedspending a whopping $17.5 million against the cap, and his reportshowed heavy expenditures across the Super Tuesday states.   On the Democratic side, Dukakis had spent the most against theceiling, at $7.8 million.   Also on Monday, Democrat Gore won the endorsement of AlabamaSen. Howell Heflin as he continued lining up support of as manySouthern politicians as possible in advance of Super Tuesday.   But in an unusual news conference, Heflin said he wanted to``educate'' Gore on some of the issues. ``He's not too far to theleft, but I've got to try to bring him to the middle a littlebit,'' Heflin said. ``I'm going to work on him.''   In the Republican race, Kemp appeared before an economics classat the University of Minnesota and called Bush's advocacy of afour-year budget freeze ``embarrassing.''   Said Kemp, ``Can you think of anything more yawning in aperesidential campaign that having the Republican candidate runningfor president say, `If I become president I'm going to freeze thebudget for four years?'''   Robertson was in South Carolina, where he has declared he needsa win in the March 5 primary. He announced his support forlegislation to limit textile imports and challenged Bush to do thesame.   At Lander College in Greenwood, Robertson won applause when hecalled for school prayer. It used to be, he said, that ``littlechildren could pray in the public schools of America and we've gotto see that once again.''   Dole won the endorsement of South Carolina Sen. Strom Thurmond.   The Kansas senator's campaign manager, former Sen. Bill Brock,took several sharp jabs at Bush and his campaign. He accused thevice president's campaign of taking two ``cheap shots'' before theIowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary.   He said the first attempt failed. The second one ``worked shortterm. We'll see whether they worked in the long term,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
