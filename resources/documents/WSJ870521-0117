Crandall,chairman and president of AMR Corp. and its American Airlinesunit, was grilled at the annual meeting for nearly threehours by angry flight attendants questioning the company'slatest contract offer.   Mr. Crandall reiterated the company's intention to unilaterally impose its latest contract offer, effective June 1, but said the company is willing to reopen negotiations to ensure ratification.    Contract talks between American and its union, the Association of Professional Flight Attendants, broke off in March, triggering a 30-day cooling-off period that expired April 25.    On that date, American was free, under the federal Railway Labor Act, to impose its March 11 offer.    &quot;We want agreements,&quot; Mr. Crandall said. &quot;We don't want fights.&quot;    But a fight is just what Mr. Crandall got yesterday.    It started with about 50 flight attendants picketing outside the hotel where the company was holding its annual meeting. The union members shouted slogans such as, &quot;Hey, hey. What do you say? Let's share Crandall's pay.&quot;    And though the meeting was more decorous, it was held under heavy security. Credentials were closely checked, and a post-meeting news conference was held on a restricted access floor of the hotel.    During the meeting, Mr. Crandall was forced to scrap his prepared remarks as questioning continued for several hours, with most of the queries coming from flight attendants who chartered a plane to attend the meeting here.    The union charged that the Dallas-based company held the annual meeting in North Carolina to avoid a confrontation. The company said it chose the location to celebrate the planned June 15 opening of its new hub in Raleigh/Durham, N.C.    Mr. Crandall defended the company's offer to its flight attendants as one that proposes &quot;substantially higher&quot; wages than many other carriers. American says the offer would boost the average flight attendant's compensation to $14,900 for a first-year employee, and to $37,700 at the top of the wage scale.    Under the previous contract, which became renewable in December, the range was from $13,500 to $37,100.    The flight attendants want to eliminate American's so-called two-tier system of wages, which pays employees hired since 1983 significantly less than more-senior employees.    Despite his offer to reopen negotiations, Mr. Crandall's comments left little doubt that the company isn't prepared to sweeten the terms beyond its March 11 offer. When one attendant addressed the issue of working without a contract, Mr. Crandall snapped back, &quot;The point of the matter is we do have a contract. It simply is not a ratified contract.&quot;    The flight attendants union has threatened a work slowdown if the company imposes its contract June 1. But Mr. Crandall said the company would &quot;discipline any employees that do not properly do their job.&quot;    On other topics, Mr. Crandall said the company's April traffic was stronger than expected and &quot;summer bookings look good.&quot;    &quot;If the level of fares which exists as of today remains in effect, we think we'll have a very good summer,&quot; he added.    He also said he doesn't expect the company's new hub in Raleigh/Durham to turn a profit for about a year.    Separately, stockholders passed, by a wide margin, a proposal &quot;to eliminate the liability of directors for negligence in the performance of their duties, including gross negligence.&quot;    But holders defeated other proposals to rotate the location of the annual meeting; to establish cumulative voting in electing the board; and to adopt a &quot;comparable worth&quot; standard for employee salaries.    A proposal to rescind the company's so-called poison pill provision also was defeated, but 37.9% of the company's shares outstanding were voted in favor of the proposal. Such a provision is designed to make a hostile takeover prohibitively expensive. </TEXT></DOC>
