PLC said Wednesday it isnegotiating to sell its minerals operations to RTZ Corp. PLC, a dealthat analysts said could generate $3 billion to $4 billion for BP.   BP said the talks were exclusively with RTZ, a British miningcompany with interests worldwide, and exclude any mineralsbusinesses of BP Canada.   Rumors of the talks have circulated for the last week and havehelped drive British Petroleum's shares up and RTZ's down.   British Petroleum did not elaborate on the statement except tosay that a further announcement will be made in due course.   Its minerals interests include activities in gold, silver, copperand uranium mines in the United States, Australia, Papua New Guinea,Mexico and South Africa.   British Petroleum has considered selling off its gold operationsfor some time. In September, it postponed indefinitely the pricingdate for an initial public offering of about 15 percent of the goldsubsidiary.   As speculation about the talks mounted last week, some analystssaid British Petroleum would use the proceeds of the sale to buyinto existing businesses, possibly even including a bid for UnocalCorp. of the United States.   Other analysts noted that it could use the cash earned either toreduce debt or buy back shares held by the Kuwait Investment Office.The Kuwaiti government body currently owns 21.68 percent of BritishPetroleum and has been told by the British government to reduce itsholding to 9.9 percent, within a provisional timetable of a year.   The money could give British Petroleum flexibility in bargainingwith Kuwait over a sale price for some of the 700 million shares,which at current market prices have a total value of about 1.8billion pounds _ equaling about $3.3 billion at current exchangerates.   British Petroleum shares closed Wednesday at the equivalent of$4.74 a share, up 11 cents. RTZ's shares fell 11 cents to finish at$7.01 a share.   Analysts said it could take weeks to complete negotiations overthe sale of the minerals businesses.</TEXT></DOC>
