Kirk sayshe believes the differences on issues between factions backingMichael Dukakis and Jesse Jackson will be resolved to ensure partyunity.   His Republican counterpart, Frank Fahrenkopf, puts it a littledifferently.   ``They'll cut a deal,'' Fahrenkopf said.   In a sometimes testy, occasionally funny and mostly good-natureddebate Tuesday night, the two party chairmen squared off on a hostof issues, including the economy, foreign policy, their respectivepresidential candidates and Jackson.   Asked by an audience member what the party would do aboutJackson, Kirk responded that at the platform meeting this pastweekend the backers of Michael Dukakis and Jackson ``were together... working in a civil and constructive way about issues, about thefuture.''   ``I think Rev. Jackson has run a very positive campaign and Ithink he'll make a constructive and positive impact on the fallresults,'' Kirk added.   ``Within the platform there may be some differences, there maybe some votes on the floor of the convention, I don't think they'llbe the kind of issues that will divide the party. I think they can... make some statements which are important as well.''   Fahrenkopf, who wasn't specifically asked about Jackson, blurtedout, ``They'll cut a deal.''   The Republican chairman also criticized Kirk for what hedescribed as the Democratic failure to come up with a partyplatform detailing where they stand on major issues.   ``You say, `We're for peace, and we're for everyone having a joband for good education,' and you won't level with the Americanpeople and tell the American people in a platform how you're goingto arrive at it,'' Fahrenkopf said. ``You're afraid to put that onthe table.''   Democrats met this past weekend in Michigan, where they agreedthat their platform must brand South Africa a terrorist state, butsidestepped the question of the federal budget deficit and whetherto call for higher taxes on the rich.   At the debate, Kirk criticized the Reagan administration'seconomic and foreign policies.   ``The United States of America went from the largest creditornation in the world to the largest debtor nation in the world infive years under the Republican Party,'' Kirk said.   The Democratic chairman, noting the Iran-Contra scandal, saidthe nation has seen ``a foreign policy in disarray, operating ondeceit, diversion and deniability.''   Kirk and Fahrenkopf referred to the issues that the twopresidential contenders, Dukakis and Republican George Bush, areexpected to focus on in the months leading up to the generalelection.   Fahrenkopf pointed to a strong economy with high unemploymentand a lower trade deficit. He also noted the better relationshipbetween the United States and Soviet Union.   Kirk noted the administration's failure to balance the budgetand cited Dukakis' success in achieving that goal in Massachusetts.</TEXT></DOC>
