Two other letters from Cordes were delivered to his familyWednesday. He was abducted in Beirut, Lebanon, on Jan. 17, 1987.   The West German-Algerian man who delivered the three letterssaid he believed Cordes would be freed soon.   ``The chances look genuinely good,'' said Abdel-Kadar Sahraouiin an interview with the ZDF television network.   Government sources confirmed privately that Sahraoui, identifiedas a middleman by news media, delivered the letters but theyrefused to give details.   Federal government spokesman Norbert Schaefer announced Thursdaynight that the third letter was received and said the governmentand family were convinced the letters were authentic.   ``The government and Cordes' family have received signs that heis alive through these three letters,'' Schaefer said.   He said a special panel of government security officialsmonitoring the hostage situation in Lebanon met for an hour todiscuss the letters.   He would not reveal the contents of the letters or details ofthe meeting.   In the ZDF interview, Sahraoui did not say whether he metpersonally with Cordes' captors.   He said Cordes is being treated by a doctor, but that ``his lifeis not in danger.'' Earlier West German news reports said Cordeswas ill.   Days after Shiite Moslem radicals kidnapped Cordes in Beirut,another West German businessman, Alfred Schmidt, was also kidnappedin the Lebanese capital.   Schmidt's kidnappers freed him last September in what theycalled a ``goodwill gesture.''   Last April, a court in Duesseldorf convicted Abbas Hamadi ofmasterminding the two abductions in a bid to force West Germany tofree his brother, Mohammed Ali Hamadi.   Mohammed Hamadi now is on trial in Frankfurt, charged with airpiracy and murder in a 1985 TWA hijacking in which U.S. Navy diverRobert Stethem was killed.</TEXT></DOC>
