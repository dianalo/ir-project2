(A) - Bob Hope says he might travel to SaudiArabia to entertain U.S. forces facing Iraqi troops, but he isworried about taking beautiful women as he has on previous overseastours.   ``The Saudi Arabians, they don't like a girl unless she'swearing a veil,'' he said Saturday. ``I can't see Madonna wearing aveil.''   If he does go, he said, it would be during the Christmasholidays.   Hope said he would not take his golf clubs. ``I don't need asand trap that big,'' he said.   Hope also reminisced about former President Dwight Eisenhowerduring his performance Saturday night at the Kansas Expocentre.   The comedian met Eisenhower, then allied commander, during WorldWar II. He was called to Eisenhower's office in Algiers whilepreparing a 1943 radio show.   Eisenhower promised him he wouldn't experience any bombings, butthe city was bombed that night for the first time in years.   ``That's always been a big joke because I wired him and said,`Thanks for the rest,' '' Hope said.   More than 4,000 people attended the show to benefit RonaldMcDonald House, which provides low-cost shelter to families ofhospitalized children. Concert promoter Doug Holladay said Hope cuthis fee in half to $37,500.</TEXT></DOC>
