Radiationdamage and aging effects in bulk and fiber were also investigated. Electronparamagnetic resonance and optical spectroscopies were used to studythe centers generated by the ionizing radiation. A parallel study ofthe intrinsic bonding defects in SiO{sub 2} films grown by a varietyof techniques was also carried out.</TEXT></DOC>
