If that rate held for 12 consecutive months, inflation at thewholesale level would amount to 6.9 percent, more than triple the2.2 percent price rise for 1987. For the first eight months of1988, wholesale inflation was running at an annual rate of 4.3percent.

Most post offices cut hours by about a half-day a week to helpcope with $160 million in congressionally imposed spending cuts.The service reductions came two months before postage rate hikes,which took nearly a year to put into effect, were instituted tocope with a rising deficit by the Postal Service.   The unexpected spending reduction came as part of overall cutsin government expenditures aimed at reducing the budget deficit,even though the Postal Service no longer receives a taxpayersubsidy.   While the the postal window hours will be restored, the newhours will not necessarily be the same as those that were in effectat each office before the closings were imposed, officials said.

The announcement represented a victory for the State Department,which overrode contentions by the Transportation Department andprivate industry that the deal will place U.S. producers ofsatellite launchers at a competitive disadvantage.

Rep. Gerald Solomon, R-N.Y., introduced legislation to ban suchexports.

Dmitri Volkogonov using language that might once have cost aSoviet citizen his life.   The full-page article in the Communist Party newspaper, anexcerpt from a biography Volkogonov is writing of Stalin, is thelatest example of the Kremlin's new willingness to confrontlong-hidden aspects of Soviet history.   It represents a significant change in the official media'streatment of Trotsky, the golden-tongued, hot-temperedrevolutionary who was long reviled officially as a traitor andaccused of heading an anti-Soviet plot.</TEXT><DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Serbian Communist Party chief'spublic defiance of the national leadership has thrown this Balkancountry of competing ethnic groups into its most explosivepolitical crisis of the postwar era.

The key witness now supports him, and a new movie basedon Adams' case has prompted petition drives demanding his freedom.   ``The Thin Blue Line,'' directed by Errol Morris, stronglysuggests the wrong man was tried and petitions are circulating intheaters calling for a pardon.   Dallas County District Attorney John Vance said he isunimpressed by the film, which is now playing in more than 200cities, and sees no reason to reopen the case.   ``The Thin Blue Line'' uses both real interviews with most ofthe key people in the case and re-enactments of the shooting fromthe perspectives of different characters.</TEXT><DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Seoul gourmets continue to enjoy dogstew and Korean Olympic stars have been consuming barrels of snakesoup despite government attempts to ban the traditional delicaciesduring the Summer Games.
