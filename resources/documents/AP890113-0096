(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A Korean-American businessman arrested in analleged conspiracy to purchase nerve-gas bombs had contacts inBritain, South Korea and possibly Iran, but officials say it's stillunclear who wanted the weapons.   Juwhan Yun, 48, was arrested Thursday and was being held withoutbail at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in New York Citypending a bond hearing Tuesday.   A federal complaint accused Yun of conspiring to violate the ArmsExport Control Act by seeking to ship bombs containing sarin, a gasthat causes convulsions and death by attacking the central nervoussystem.   Yun negotiated with an undercover U.S. Customs Service agentposing as an arms dealer to purchase 500 quarter-ton bombs and otherweapons, said Richard Mercier, chief agent at the federal agency'sNewark office.   He described the gas as a ``very rapid, odorless, colorlesspoison which can enter the body by inhalation, absorption orinjection.''   No weapons were ever delivered, officials said.   ``I can't say that there was any indication there was ever anyplan to use it or in fact there was actually an end purchaser whohad plans to deploy it in any fashion,'' said Michael P. Chertoff,first assistant U.S. attorney.   At one point in the dealings, the purported destination for thebombs was Iran, but that has not been verified, Chertoff said.   Yun also contacted the undercover agent about the possiblepurchase of TOW anti-armor weapons and Stinger anti-aircraftmissiles, apparently for delivery to Iran, the complaint said.   A Briton, Charles Caplan, also was charged in the case, whichChertoff called a ``wide-ranging, trans-Atlantic conspiracy.''   Concern over the potential spread of chemical weapons hasintensified recently. At a United Nations conference in Paris onWednesday, more than 140 nations reaffirmed the 1925 Geneva Protocolbanning the use of chemical arms.   Yun's arrest came the same day the West German governmentreversed itself and said it suspected German companies helped builda Libyan plant the United States believes is a chemical weaponsfactory. Libya says the plant will produce medicine.   Yun was arrested when his wife dropped him off at Customs officesin Newark, where he believed he was to meet the undercover agent,Mercier said.   If convicted, Yun faces up to five years in prison and a $250,000fine.   He told U.S. Magistrate Ronald Hedges that his Short Hills homewas worth $650,000 and that he also owns a $400,000 New York Citycondominium. He said he has three children and has been in theUnited States for 17 years.   The arrest followed a seven-month investigation that alsoinvolved the U.S. Department of Defense, the Army and Navy, andFrench and British customs officials.   According to the complaint, the undercover agent contacted Yunafter Customs received a tip from a confidential informant thatKomex International Corp. of Summit was seeking to buy ammunitionfor export to South Korea. Yun was identified as president of Komex,an import-export company that had engaged in legitimate armsdealings.   On Nov. 27, the complaint said, Yun telephoned Caplan, whooperates Domino Associates of London. Caplan asked Yun if he couldobtain 200 to 500 sarin bombs, and three days later Yun asked theCustoms agent if he could obtain the ordnance, the complaint said.   Throughout the negotiations, Yun was communicating with K.Y. Joo,president of Kwang Jin Trading Co. in Seoul, the complaint said.French officials entered the investigation when Yun discussed thedeal via facsimile with Joo, who was staying in a French hotel.   In subsequent fascimile messages last month, Yun and Caplandiscussed the purchase of a minimum of 500 sarin bombs for $12,000each.   Yun met with Caplan and two other people in a London hotelearlier this month, authorities said. The two others were describedin the federal complaint as co-conspirators but were not identified.   Caplan could be extradited, Chertoff said.   Caplan recently completed a nine-month prison sentence in Britainfor conspiring to export 50 gun silencers to Libya in 1985 through acompany called Domino Avionics.   He was described in court as a former employee of CBS-TV in theUnited States and a former military consultant. His attorney said hewas a small-time businessman and had a very small part of the armsbusiness.   A British Customs spokesman who requested anonymity said of thenerve gas case: ``We were approached by the U.S. authorities inconnection with this case and we conducted our own inquiries.''   The spokesman added that British authorities ``have been unableto produce any evidence that an offense has been committed in theUnited Kingdom.''   A man who answered the telephone at Komex's offices declinedcomment and hung up.   Messages were left on a telephone answering machine at DominoAssociates Holdings Ltd. Defence Suppliers' offices in London. Theywere not immediately returned.</TEXT></DOC>
