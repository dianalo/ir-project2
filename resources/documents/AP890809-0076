The members of the Iran-U.S. Claims Tribunal in The Hague,Netherlands, have remained isolated from day-to-day politics. OnTuesday, the State Department rejected a suggestion that Americanhostages in Lebanon could be released if the United States agreedto release frozen Iranian assets.   The English-language Tehran Times quoted a source saying Iranwould intercede to gain the release of the American hostages ifWashington gave assurances it would release frozen Iranian assets.   Eight American hostages are believed held by pro-Iranian ShiiteMoslems in Lebanon.   ``The questions of the assets have no connection ... whatsoeverwith the hostage issue,'' said State Department spokesman RichardBoucher. ``This is a legal process. It's a very technical process.And it's the business of the tribunal to work through the claimsand the cases before them and to work them out.''   Boucher said the United States refused to consider tying thehostages' fate to issues before the tribunal but is continuing its``intensive diplomatic efforts'' to free the captives.   However, The New York Times quoted an unidentified senioradministration official as saying there may be more room formaneuvering.   ``And while we would not give a direct quid pro quo, we wouldoffer some understanding or agreement that `if you use your goodoffices to get the hostages,' we will look favorably on your desireto get the assets,'' this official was quoted as saying.   The tribunal, established in 1981 after Iran freed Americanhostages held at the U.S. Embassy in Tehran for 444 days, has doneits work in a non-political environment.   Since it was established, the tribunal _ composed of nineinternational judges _ has resolved billions of dollars worth ofclaims. Three judges are American, three are Iranian and three arefrom other countries.   The State Department said U.S. nationals have been awarded about$1.2 billion, while Iranians have received about $118 million.   The claims, made by banks, companies, individuals andgovernments, stem from the 1979 breakdown in diplomatic relationsbetween the two nations.   The United States froze billions of dollars of Iranian assets,including hundreds of millions of dollars worth of militaryequipment bought by Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi before his regimewas toppled. Iran also seized U.S. assets.   When the tribunal was established, the United States transferredabout $9.9 billion in frozen assets to escrow accounts and to Iran.Washington has little control over that money, the disposition ofwhich is regulated by tribunal rulings.   But the Iranians have filed separate claims, amounting toroughly $12 billion, for military equipment bought under the shah.The State Department said it doesn't know how much the shah hadalready paid, but he had committed to buying $20 billion worth ofhardware.   Iran has generally followed the tribunal's decisions, makingpayments to claimants when ordered to do so, American officialssaid. Some American companies, however, have appealed thetribunal's decisions in U.S. courts, effectively delaying payments,they said.</TEXT></DOC>
