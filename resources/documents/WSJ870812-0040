SchlesingerStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 08/12/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> F LABOR GMAUTOS, AUTO PARTS (AUT) </IN><DATELINE> DETROIT  </DATELINE><TEXT>   General Motors Corp. is expected this week to ask the United Auto Workers union to accept annual lump-sum payments rather than increases in the base wage. It also wants to strengthen the link between those payments and productivity and quality.    In its first comprehensive proposal to the union in the current national contract negotiations, the company also may offer smaller payments for workers in GM's parts plants than for those in vehicle-assembly plants, sources close to the talks said. The company said the parts market is much more competitive.    The proposals are aimed at GM's stated goal of using these negotiations to improve its competitiveness through cutting costs and increasing flexibility. In the first half of this year, the No. 1 auto maker earned only 3.6 cents on every dollar of sales, compared with 7.9 cents for rival Ford Motor Co.    In return for help in competing, GM has indicated it will give the UAW some measure of job security, the union's top priority. GM may suggest in its first proposal that it is willing to guarantee at least some jobs. GM won't protect all 370,000 jobs the UAW has asked for. A major part of the company's approach probably will be tying employment protection to productivity improvements in plant-level negotiations.    &quot;Stimulating major and continuous improvements in productivity must be a top priority in these negotiations,&quot; Alfred S. Warren Jr., GM's top negotiator, said at the talks' opening.    It isn't clear how much of these proposals will be publicly announced this week, but GM certainly will float the concepts as bargaining progresses. The proposal is expected to include mostly ideas, but no specific numbers.    The expected proposal, which could come as early as today, represents only the company's opening position, and much is likely to change throughout the bargaining. Some of the points could directly reject certain UAW demands. The union, for example, has called for returning to annual base-wage increases. The current national contract, signed in 1984, paid a base-wage increase in the first year of the pact, but shifted to lump-sum payments in the last two years.    Ford also is conducting negotiations with the UAW covering 104,000 workers. The company last week outlined its general guidelines for the negotiations, saying its priorities are to improve quality and cut costs. Ford said it wants to &quot;provide reasonable job security, but it must be flexible and deliverable and at a fair cost.&quot; But Ford hasn't made a specific proposal, and probably won't do so this week, a spokesman said.    GM's initial offer comes unusually early in the bargaining process, which began July 27. The contract doesn't expire until Sept. 14, and an all-encompassing offer usually hasn't come until about two weeks before the pact's expiration. &quot;We're trying to stay away from position bargaining,&quot; Mr. Warren said last week in disclosing the timing. &quot;I think these problems are such that we need all the time that we've got.&quot;    Mr. Warren has repeatedly refused to to discuss the specifics of the package and yesterday a GM spokesman declined comment.    Donald F. Ephlin, the UAW's main negotiator, said he wasn't aware of the specifics of GM's proposal and wouldn't speculate. But asked last week about the first proposal, he said, &quot;I don't expect it will cover all of our needs.&quot;    Mr. Warren has dropped repeated hints in interviews and in public briefings about the course GM will pursue in the negotiations. About the union's push for wage increases, Mr. Warren has consistently said: &quot;I can't afford it. Anything that adds to the cost of the product further jeopardizes our ability to compete.&quot;    In a briefing for the union negotiators last Friday, he specifically underscored GM's concern about the competitiveness of its parts operations, which includes 120,000 workers. GM makes an estimated 60% to 70% of its parts in-house, compared with an estimated 40% to 50% by Ford. &quot;The advantage for Ford of course is they are able to buy those parts at world prices,&quot; Mr. Warren told reporters after the meeting. &quot;That's a problem for us.&quot; He declined to offer specific solutions at the time.    Mr. Warren, along with other GM executives, has also said many times that he accepts in principle the UAW's desire for job security. In 1984, the company set up a &quot;job bank&quot; that protected workers affected by certain factors such as productivity, technology, or the transfer of work to other companies.    But that program didn't cover workers affected by market downturns, protection the union now says it wants. The UAW has covered that problem at certain farm equipment companies by securing a guaranteed level of employment.    In remarks at the opening of the talks three weeks ago, Mr. Warren discussed absenteeism, which the company probably will try to reduce to help fund any pay increases or job security programs. GM has said that controllable absences cost it as much as $1 billion last year.    ---           GM's Proposal   Expected highlights of General Motors Corp.'s openingproposal to the United Auto Workers:   -- Lump-sum payments, instead of annual wage increases,tied partially to productivity and quality.   -- Lower payments for workers in parts plants thanassembly plants.   -- A more direct link between job security and changes inwork practices at individual plants.   -- A possible guarantee of some jobs, but not for the full370,000 jobs the UAW seeks.</TEXT></DOC>
