HilderStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 11/09/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> CCI FIN FTENDER OFFERS, MERGERS, ACQUISITIONS (TNM)BANKS, THRIFT INSTITUTIONS (BNK) </IN><TEXT>   Citicorp, eager to expand its consumer banking presence in California, is preparing to bid for the retail branch system of American Savings andamp; Loan Association, the main unit of troubled Financial Corp. of America, thrift industry officials said.    Citicorp's renewed interest in the 180 branches and 23 loan offices of American Savings stems from two factors, industry officials said: a greater likelihood that the Federal Reserve Board would approve such an acquisition under Chairman Alan Greenspan than under former chairman Paul Volcker; and the recent drop in interest rates, which reduces the losses that would have to be absorbed by Citicorp and the Federal Savings andamp; Loan Insurance Corp.    Even if Citicorp and the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, which controls the FSLIC, can agree on terms and jointly lobby the Fed, the acquisition still would present substantial regulatory hurdles, thrift executives said. And the Bank Board still would have to deal with potential losses in Financial Corp.'s big portfolio of troubled real estate and its $18 billion holdings of mortgage-backed securities.    However, Citicorp's interest could provide the Bank Board with a serious alternative to a bid for American Savings submitted by Ford Motor Co.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday, Citicorp closed at $42.75, up 25 cents a share. Financial Corp. of America closed at $2.375, up 62.5 cents, while Ford closed at $75.625, down $2.875.    The Bank Board said Friday that its discussions with Dearborn, Mich.-based Ford are continuing, and said it also is holding discussions with Citicorp about American Savings. A Bank Board spokesman declined to provide any details of the talks. A spokesman for New York-based Citicorp and officials of Irvine, Calif.-based Financial Corp. declined to comment.    Anthony M. Frank, chairman of Ford's big thrift unit, San Francisco-based First Nationwide Bank, said in an interview, &quot;The issue is simple. Do they (the Bank Board members) want a permanent, comprehensive solution or not? Ours is a comprehensive, permanent approach that solves all the problems of Financial Corp.,&quot; he said.    &quot;I think the situation is that Black Monday gave the Bank Board $1 billion in reduced losses on the mortgage-backed securities portfolio,&quot; Mr. Frank said. &quot;And if they want to waste the opportunity to lock in those gains, that's their decision.&quot;    After the Oct. 19 stock-market crash, the Fed loosened credit and investors pumped money into fixed-income securities, raising their value and pushing down interest rates.    Financial Corp. common shares jumped 36% Friday as traders apparently believed shareholders might fare better if Citicorp submits a bid.    Under one plan being considered by Financial Corp. and the Bank Board, thrift officials said, Financial Corp.'s real estate and mortgage-backed securities would be spun off into one or two separate companies if Citicorp takes over the American Savings branch system.    The new unit or units would remain under Bank Board regulation, and operating profit from the mortgage-backed securities portfolio would provide cash needed to support the real estate operations. However, because the securities carry fixed rates and are funded by short-term borrowings, the unit or units would face the risk of big losses if interest rates rise sharply.    According to officials familiar with the talks between Citicorp and the Bank Board, three Citicorp executives met last week with Roger Martin, a Bank Board member, and Financial Corp. executives.    Earlier this year, Citicorp had expressed interest in American Savings, the officials said, but concluded it was unlikely that the Fed, under Mr. Volcker, would grant Citicorp the necessary approvals.    However, the officials said, Mr. Greenspan seems more inclined to allow banking companies to expand their interstate operations, and would be more likely to grant Citicorp certain forbearances.    A strategic problem for Citicorp is the approximately $1 billion in good will carried on Financial Corp.'s books. The good will, which is the amount by which the price of an acquisition exceeds the net value of the assets acquired, was generated in a 1983 acquisition by Financial Corp. and is tied to its branch system.    In addition, more good will would be generated by Citicorp's acquisition of fixed-rate mortgages also associated with the branch system. Under existing Fed rules, Citicorp would have to deduct the good will from its capital, as figured for regulatory purposes.    Citicorp also wants to put together a single back-office system to serve all its thrift units, located in California, Florida, Illinois, Arizona and Washington, D.C. So far, the Fed has required Citicorp to operate each thrift separately.    Earlier this year, Citicorp bought 50 California thrift branches from a unit of Sears, Roebuck andamp; Co, bringing its total number of branches in the state to nearly 150. All of the American Savings offices are in California. </TEXT></DOC>
