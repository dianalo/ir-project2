StevensStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 08/07/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> EUROP CANDA FREST JAPANMONETARY NEWS, FOREIGN EXCHANGE, TRADE (MON)FOREIGN-EXCHANGE MARKETS (FRX)PRECIOUS METALS, STONES, GOLD, SILVER (PCS)COMMODITY NEWS, FARM PRODUCTS (CMD) </IN><TEXT>   For the third consecutive day, some major central banks fought off a bullish charge by the dollar, substantially limiting the U.S. currency's gains.    The intervention by the U.S. Federal Reserve and the West German Bundesbank seemed to represent a stepped-up effort to contain the dollar in its surge prompted by fears of a widened Persian Gulf war. Yesterday's action appeared more coordinated than the earlier efforts.    As before, all central bank dollar sales were against the West German mark. However, in late New York trading the U.S. currency still held part of its advance for the day, standing at 1.8836 marks, compared with 1.8804 late Wednesday.    &quot;The (intervention) had a very short-term effect in the market,&quot; a trader at a commercial bank that deals with the Fed said. Commercial bank traders with firsthand knowledge of the intervention estimated that the Fed sold $100 million through several banks in early New York trading, shortly after the Bundesbank sold a like amount in the open market in Frankfurt.    The central banks formed a skirmish line for the dollar at 1.8840 marks, where they sold the currency, knowledgeable traders said. Before its open-market intervention, the Bundesbank sold $5.7 million at yesterday's Frankfurt foreign exchange fixing as the U.S. currency rose to 1.8842 marks, a seven-month high.    Traders say the intervention level stems from February's Louvre accord in Paris. At that time, the U.S. and its major allies agreed to maintain exchange-rate stability, though they have never formally acknowledged setting specific target zones for rates.    There also was speculation that the Bank of England sold $100 million for marks in London trading.    But although the amounts represented an increase from the level of intervention reported early this week, the activity was still modest compared with the central banks' coordinated effort to support the dollar this spring. For this reason, some traders say the central banks now seek only to check the dollar's advance, not to reverse it.    &quot;If the central banks really wanted to turn the market around, to get us back to 1.80 (marks), they'd come in with heavy dollars,&quot; Valerie J. Walker, vice president, foreign exchange, at Harris Trust andamp; Savings Bank, New York, said. &quot;They just don't want the dollar to go breakneck to 1.90 without there being some fundamental justification.&quot;    In other trading, the British pound eased to $1.5773 from $1.5797 despite an increase of a full percentage point, to 10%, in the base lending rate of some major British banks. The move followed the Bank of England's action in raising its money market intervention rate a full point to 9 7/8%.    Higher British interest rates should make sterling-denominated investments more attractive and increase demand for the pound. But traders interpreted yesterday's rate increase as a government-inspired move to control inflation, and inflationary fears have put sterling under pressure in recent weeks.    &quot;Raising the rates scared people as to the actual state of the economy,&quot; Anthony J. Murphy, a sterling trader for Royal Bank of Canada in New York, said.    The dollar was slightly higher on the day against most other major currencies as well, rising to 151.45 Japanese yen in late New York trading from 150.82 a day earlier.    In early trading in Tokyo today, the dollar was quoted at 151.20 yen.    On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery rose $1.20 an ounce to $468 in moderate trading. Estimated volume was 3.5 million ounces.    Gold was quoted at $468.45 an ounce in early trading today in Hong Kong.    ---                    LATE NEW YORK TRADING                   Thursday, Aug. 6, 1987   Based on average of late afternoon buying and sellingrates.
