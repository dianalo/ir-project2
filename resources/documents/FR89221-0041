The plan encompassed a reviewof airspace use and procedural aspects of the ATC system. Among the mainobjectives of the NAR was the improvement of the ATC system by increasingefficiency and reducing complexity. In its review of terminal airspace,NAR Task Group 1-2 concluded that TRSA's should be replaced. Four typesof airspace configurations were considered as replacement candidates, ofwhich Model B, since redesignated ARSA, was recommended by a consensus.In response, the FAA published NAR Recommendation 1-2.2.1, ``Replace TerminalRadar Service Areas with Model B Airspace and Service'' in Notice 83-9(July 28, 1983; 48 FR 34286) proposing the establishment of ARSA's at theRobert Mueller Municipal Airport, Austin, TX, and the Port of ColumbusInternational Airport, Columbus, OH. ARSA's were designated at these airportson a temporary basis by SFAR No. 45 (October 28, 1983; 48 FR 50038) inorder to provide an operational confirmation of the ARSA concept for potentialapplication on a national basis.Following a confirmation period of more than a year, the FAA adopted theNAR recommendation and, on February 27, 1985, issued a final rule (50 FR9252; March 6, 1985) defining an ARSA and establishing air traffic rulesfor operation within such an area. Concurrently, by separate rulemakingaction, ARSA's were permanently established at the Austin, TX; Columbus,OH; and the Baltimore/Washington International Airports (50 FR 9250; March6, 1985). The FAA has stated that future notices would propose ARSA's forother airports at which TRSA procedures are in effect.Additionally, the NAR Task Group recommended that the FAA develop quantitativecriteria for proposing to establish ARSA's at locations other than thosewhich are included in the TRSA replacement program. The task group recommendedthat these criteria take into account, among other things, traffic mix,flow and density, airport configuration, geographical features, collisionrisk assessment, and ATC capabilities to provide service to users. Thiscriteria has been developed and is being published via the FAA directivessystem.The FAA has established ARSA's at 125 locations under a paced implementationplan to replace TRSA's with ARSA's. This is one of a series of noticesto implement ARSA's at locations with TRSA's or locations without TRSA'swhich warrant implementation of an ARSA. This notice proposes ARSA designationat one of the locations identified as candidates for an ARSA in the preambleto Amendment No. 71-10 (50 FR 9252). Other candidate locations will beproposed in future notices published in the <T4> Federal Register.</T4> <ITAG tagnum="84">The Current Situation at the Proposed ARSA Location </ITAG>John Wayne Airport/Orange County is a public airport with an operatingcontrol tower served by a Level V Radar Approach Control Facility and aLimited Approach Control Facility. The airport operations at this airportare quite varied as to the mix of aircraft. Speeds range from the extremelyslow to the maximum speed allowed under regulations with maneuverabilityvarying from the extremely maneuverable to the slower maneuvering aircraft.Although most aircraft landing at John Wayne Airport/Orange County aresequenced with the aid of radar, airspace and operating rules are not establishedby regulation. Participation by pilots operating under visual flight rules(VFR) is voluntary, although pilots are urged to participate. This levelof service is known as Stage II and is provided at some locations not identifiedas TRSA's. The NAR Task Group recommended and the FAA adopted the establishmentof numerical criteria to allow airports having particular safety, traffic,and other needs to become ARSA candidates regardless of whether such airportswere encompassed by TRSA's. John Wayne Airport/Orange County is in thiscategory of airports. John Wayne Airport/Orange County is rapidly becoming more heavily usedby numerous air carriers and air taxis. The number of passengers boardedannually far surpasses the number necessary for ARSA candidacy. The NAR Task Group stated that, due to the different levels of serviceoffered in terminal areas such as John Wayne Airport/Orange County, usersare not always sure of what restrictions or privileges exist, or how tocope with them. Stage II services offered at John Wayne Airport/OrangeCounty include traffic advisories and sequencing to the runway but do notinclude conflict resolution in the terminal airspace. Participation inthis program is strictly voluntary. The only service available outsidethe airport traffic area (ATA) is separation for instrument flight rules(IFR) traffic and VFR traffic advisories as an additional service. Somebelieve that the voluntary nature of Stage II at airports with moderatetraffic levels does not adequately address the problems associated withnonparticipating aircraft operating in relative proximity to the airportand its associated approach and departure courses. There is strong advocacyamong user organizations that, within a given standard airspace designation,a terminal radar facility should provide all pilots with the same levelof service, and in the same manner, to the extent that this is feasible.Certain provisions of FAR andSection; 91.87 add to the problem identifiedby the task group. For example, aircraft operating under VFR to or froma satellite airport and within the ATA of the primary airport are excludedfrom the two-way radio communications requirement of andSection; 91.87. Thiscondition is acceptable until the volume and density of traffic at theprimary airport dictates further action.<ITAG tagnum="84">The Proposal </ITAG>The FAA is considering an amendment to Part 71 of the Federal AviationRegulations (14 CFR Part 71) that would adjust the lateral limits of theEl Toro MCAS ARSA to accommodate the adjoining Santa Ana ARSA and establishan ARSA at John Wayne Airport/Orange County, Santa Ana, CA. This locationis a public airport with an operating control tower served by a Level VRadar Approach Control Facility and a Limited Approach Control Facility.The FAA has published a final rule (50 FR 9252; March 6, 1985) which definesARSA and prescribes operating rules for aircraft, ultralight vehicles,and parachute jump operations in airspace designated as an ARSA. The final rule provides in part that all aircraft arriving at any airportin an ARSA or flying through an ARSA, prior to entering the ARSA, must:(1) Establish two-way radio communications with the ATC facility havingjurisdiction over the area; and (2) while in the ARSA, maintain two-wayradio communications with that ATC facility. For aircraft departing fromthe primary airport within the ARSA, two-way radio communications mustbe maintained with the ATC facility having jurisdiction over the area.For aircraft departing a satellite airport within the ARSA, two-way radiocommunications must be established as soon as practicable after takeoffwith the ATC facility having jurisdiction over the area, and thereaftermaintained while operating within the ARSA. All aircraft operating within an ARSA are required to comply with all ATCclearances and instructions and any FAA arrival or departure traffic patternfor the airport of intended operation. However, the rule permits ATC toauthorize appropriate deviations from any of the operating requirementsof the rule when safety considerations justify the deviation or more efficientutilization of the airspace can be attained. Ultralight vehicle operationsand parachute jumps in an ARSA may only be conducted under the terms ofan ATC authorization. The FAA adopted the NAR Task Group recommendation that each ARSA be ofthe same airspace configuration insofar as is practicable. The standardARSA consists of airspace within 5 nautical miles of the primary airportextending from the surface to an altitude of 4,000 feet above that airport'selevation, and that airspace between 5 and 10 nautical miles from the primaryairport from 1,200 feet above the surface to an altitude of 4,000 feetabove that airport's elevation. Proposed deviations from this standardhave been necessary at some airports due to adjacent regulatory airspace,international boundaries, topography, or unusual operational requirements.This proposal deviates from the standard ARSA ceiling southwest of JohnWayne Airport/Orange County. As a result of user comments and recommendationsalong with documented incident reports, the increasing operations in thisarea above 4,000 feet have mandated raising the ceiling by 1,000 feet.This would provide for a safer transition of aircraft landing at John WayneAirport/Orange County while not designating an unnecessary amount of airspace.Definitions, operating requirements, and specific airspace designationsapplicable to ARSA's may be found in andSection;andSection; 71.14 and 71.501of Part 71 and andSection;andSection; 91.1 and 91.88 of Part 91 of the FederalAviation Regulations (14 CFR Parts 71, 91). For the reasons discussed under ``Regulatory Evaluation,'' the FAA hasdetermined that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``major rule'' underExecutive Order 12291; and (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOTRegulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979). <ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Evaluation </ITAG>The FAA conducted a Regulatory Evaluation of the proposed establishmentof an ARSA at John Wayne Airport/Orange County. The major findings of thatevaluation are summarized below, and the full evaluation is available inthe regulatory docket. a. Costs Costs which potentially could result from the ARSA program fall into thefollowing categories: (1) Air traffic controller staffing, controller training, and facilityequipment costs incurred by the FAA. (2) Costs associated with the revision of charts, notification of the public,and pilot education. (3) Additional operating costs for circumnavigating or flying over theARSA.(4) Potential delay costs resulting from operations within an ARSA. (5) The need for some operators to purchase radio transceivers. (6) Miscellaneous costs. It has been the FAA's experience, however, that these potential costs donot materialize to any appreciable degree, and when they do occur, theyare transitional, relatively low in magnitude, or attributable to specificimplementation problems that have been experienced at a very small minorityof ARSA sites. The reasons for these conclusions are presented below. Participation in Stage II at John Wayne Airport/Orange County is alreadyquite high, and the separation standards permitted in ARSA's will allowcontrollers to absorb the slight increase in participating traffic by handlingall traffic more efficiently. Thus, the FAA expects that the ARSA programcan be implemented without requiring additional controller personnel abovecurrently authorized staffing levels. Further, because controller trainingwill be conducted during normal working hours, and John Wayne Airport/OrangeCounty already operates the necessary radar equipment, the FAA does notexpect to incur any appreciable implementation costs. Essentially, theFAA is modifying its terminal radar procedures in the ARSA program in amanner that will make more efficient use of existing resources. No additional costs are expected to be incurred because of the need torevise sectional charts to incorporate the new ARSA airspace boundaries.Changes of this nature are routinely made during charting cycles, and theplanned effective dates for newly established ARSA's are scheduled to coincidewith the regular 6-month chart publication intervals. Much of the need to notify the public and educate pilots about ARSA operationswill be met as a part of this rulemaking proceeding. The informal publicmeeting being held at each location where an ARSA is proposed providespilots with the best opportunity to learn both how an ARSA works and howit will affect their local operations. Because the expenses associatedwith these public meetings will be incurred regardless of whether or notan ARSA is ultimately established at any given site, they are more appropriatelyconsidered sunken costs attributable to the rulemaking process rather thancosts of the ARSA program. Once the decision has been made to establishan ARSA through a final rule issued in this proceeding, however, any publicinformation costs which follow are strictly attributable to the ARSA program.The FAA expects to distribute a Letter to Airmen to all pilots residingwithin 50 miles of each ARSA site explaining the operation and configurationof the ARSA that is being adopted. The FAA has also issued an AdvisoryCircular on ARSA's. The combined Letter to Airmen and prorated AdvisoryCircular costs for the airport at which an ARSA is being proposed in thisnotice is estimated to be about $450. This cost will be incurred only onceupon the initial establishment of this ARSA. Information on ARSA's following implementation of the program will alsobe disseminated at aviation safety seminars conducted throughout the countryby various district offices. These seminars are provided regularly by theFAA to discuss a variety of aviation safety issues; therefore, they willnot involve additional costs strictly as a result of the ARSA program.Additionally, no significant costs are expected to be incurred as a resultof the follow-on user meetings that will be held at each site followingimplementation of the ARSA to allow users to provide feedback to the FAAon local ARSA operations. These meetings are being held at public or otherfacilities which are being provided free of charge or at nominal cost.Further, because these meetings are being conducted by local FAA facilitypersonnel, no travel, per diem, or overtime costs will be incurred by regionalor headquarters personnel. The FAA anticipates that some pilots who currently transit the terminalarea without establishing radio communications or participating in radarservices may choose to circumnavigate the mandatory participation airspaceof an ARSA rather than participate. Some minor delay costs will be incurredby these pilots because of the additional aircraft variable operating costand lost crew and passenger time resulting from the deviation. Other pilotsmay elect to overfly the ARSA, or transit below the 1,200 feet above groundlevel (AGL) floor between the 5- and 10-nautical-mile rings. Although thiswill not result in any appreciable delay, a small additional fuel burnwill result from the climb portion of the altitude adjustment (which willbe offset somewhat by the descent). The FAA recognizes that the potential exists for delays to develop at somelocations following the establishment of an ARSA. The additional trafficthat the radar facilities will be handling as a result of the mandatoryparticipation requirement may, in some instances, result in minor delaysto aircraft operations. The FAA does not expect such delay to be appreciable.The FAA expects that the flexibility afforded controllers in handling trafficas a result of the separation standards allowed in an ARSA will keep delayproblems to a minimum. Those delays that do occur will be transitionalin nature, diminishing as facilities gain operating experience with ARSA'sand learn how to tailor procedures and allocate resources to take fullestadvantage of the efficiencies permitted by ARSA's. This has been the experienceat the three locations where ARSA's have been in effect for the longestperiod of time; it is also the trend at most of the locations that havebeen designated more recently.The FAA does not expect that any operators will find it necessary to installradio transceivers as a result of establishing the ARSA proposed in thisnotice. Aircraft operating to and from primary airports already are requiredto have two-way radio communications capability because of existing airporttraffic areas; therefore, these operators will not incur any additionalcosts as a result of the proposed ARSA's. Further, the FAA has made aneffort to minimize these potential costs throughout the ARSA program byproviding airspace exclusions, or cutouts, for satellite airports locatedwithin 5 nautical miles of the ARSA center where the ARSA would otherwisehave extended down to the surface. Procedural agreements between the localATC facility and the affected airports have also been used to avoid radioinstallation costs. Most non-radio equipped (NORDO) aircraft in the vicinityof John Wayne Airport/Orange County are located outside of the 5-nautical-milering and therefore will not be affected by the mandatory participationrequirements. At some proposed ARSA locations, special situations might exist where establishmentof an ARSA could impose certain costs on users of that airspace. However,exclusions, cutouts, and special procedures have been used extensivelythroughout the ARSA program to alleviate adverse impacts on local fixedbase and airport operators. Similarly, the FAA has eliminated potentialadverse impacts on soaring, ballooning, parachuting, ultralight and bannertowing activities, as well as on existing flight training practice areas,by developing special procedures to accommodate these activities throughlocal agreements between ATC facilities and the affected organizations.For these reasons, the FAA does not expect that any such adverse impactswill occur at the candidate ARSA site proposed in this notice. The adjustment of the El Toro MCAS ARSA will not result in any additionalcost. The proximity of the John Wayne Airport/Orange County to the El ToroMCAS necessitates the overlapping of the 5- and 10-nautical-mile ringsof each ARSA. The meshing of these two rings constitutes the modificationto the El Toro MCAS ARSA; thus, there are no costs associated with themodification. b. Benefits Much of the benefit that will result from ARSA's is nonquantifiable andattributable to simplification and standardization of ARSA configurationsand procedures. Further, once experience is gained in ARSA operations,the flexibility allowed air traffic controllers in handling traffic withinan ARSA will enable them to move traffic as efficiently as at present butwith increased safety. Some of the benefits of the ARSA cannot be specifically attributed to individualcandidate airports, but rather will result from the overall improvementsin terminal area ATC procedures realized as ARSA's are implemented throughoutthe country. ARSA's have the potential of reducing both near and actualmidair collisions at the airports where they are established. Based uponthe experience at the Austin and Columbus ARSA confirmation sites, theFAA estimates that near midair collisions may be reduced by approximately35 to 40 percent. Further, the FAA estimates that implementation of theARSA program nationally may prevent approximately one midair collisionevery 1 to 2 years throughout the United States. The quantifiable benefitsof preventing a midair collision can range from less than $100,000, dueto the prevention of a minor nonfatal accident between general aviationaircraft, to $300 million or more, due to the prevention of a midair collisioninvolving a large air carrier aircraft resulting in numerous fatalities.Establishment of an ARSA at the site proposed in this notice will contributeto these improvements in safety. c. Comparison of Costs and Benefits A direct comparison of the costs and benefits of this proposal is difficultfor a number of reasons. Many of the benefits of the rule are nonquantifiable,and it is difficult to specifically attribute the standardization benefits,as well as the safety benefits, to individual candidate ARSA sites. The FAA expects that any adjustment problems that may be experienced atnew ARSA locations will only be temporary, and that once established, theARSA program will result in efficient terminal area operations at thoseairports where ARSA's are established. This has been the experience atthe vast majority of ARSA sites that have already been implemented. Inaddition, establishment of this proposed ARSA will contribute to a reductionin near and actual midair collisions. For these reasons, the FAA expectsthat the establishment of the ARSA proposed in this notice will producelong term, ongoing benefits that will far exceed costs, which are essentiallytransitional in nature. <ITAG tagnum="84">International Trade Impact Analysis </ITAG>This proposed regulation will only affect terminal airspace operating proceduresat selected airports within the United States. As such, it will have noeffect on the sale of foreign aviation products or services in the UnitedStates, nor will it affect the sale of United States aviation productsor services in foreign countries. <ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Flexibility Determination </ITAG>The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (RFA) was enacted by Congress toensure that small entities are not unnecessarily and disproportionatelyburdened by government regulations. Small entities are independently ownedand operated small businesses and small not-for-profit organizations. TheRFA requires agencies to review rules that may have a significant economicimpact on a substantial number of small entities. The small entities that potentially could be affected by implementationof the ARSA program include the fixed-base operators, flight schools, agriculturaloperators and other small aviation businesses located at satellite airportswithin 5 nautical miles of the ARSA Center. If the mandatory participationrequirement were to extend down to the surface at these airports, whereunder current regulations participation in radar services and radio communicationwith ATC is voluntary, operations at these airports (inside the core) mightbe altered, and some business could be lost to airports outside of theARSA core. The FAA has proposed to exclude many satellite airports locatedwithin 5 nautical miles of the primary airport at candidate ARSA sitesto avoid adversely impacting their operations and to simplify the coordinationof ATC responsibilities between the primary and satellite airports. Insome cases, the same purposes will be achieved through Letters of Agreementbetween ATC and the affected airports that establish special proceduresfor operating to and from these airports. In this manner, the FAA expectsto eliminate any adverse impact on the operations of small satellite airportsthat potentially could result from the ARSA program. Similarly, the FAAexpects to eliminate potentially adverse impacts on soaring, ballooning,parachuting, ultralight, and banner towing activities, as well as on existingflight training practice areas, by developing special procedures that willaccommodate these activities through local agreements between ATC facilitiesand the affected organizations. The FAA has utilized such arrangementsextensively in implementing the ARSA's that have been established to date.The FAA expects that any delay problems that may initially develop followingthe implementation of an ARSA will be transitory. Furthermore, becausethe airports that will be affected by the ARSA program represent only asmall proportion of all the public use airports in operation within theUnited States, small entities of any type that use aircraft in the courseof their business will not be adversely impacted. For these reasons, the FAA certifies that the proposed regulation, if adopted,will not result in a significant economic impact on a substantial numberof small entities, and a regulatory flexibility analysis is not requiredunder the terms of the RFA. <ITAG tagnum="84">Federalism Implications </ITAG>This proposed regulation will not have a substantial direct effect on theStates, on the relationship between the national government and the States,or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the variouslevels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612,preparation of a Federalism assessment is not warranted. For the reasons discussed above, the FAA has determined that this proposedregulation (1) is not a ``major rule'' under Executive Order 12291; and(2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures(44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979). <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 71 </ITAG>Aviation safety, Airport radar service areas. <ITAG tagnum="84">The Proposed Amendment </ITAG>Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me, the Federal AviationAdministration proposes to amend Part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations(14 CFR Part 71) as follows: <ITAG tagnum="56">PART 71_DESIGNATION OF FEDERAL AIRWAYS, AREA LOW ROUTES, CONTROLLEDAIRSPACE, AND REPORTING POINTS </ITAG>1.
