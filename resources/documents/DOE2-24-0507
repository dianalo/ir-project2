<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-24-0507 </DOCNO><TEXT>We have carried out elastic, quasielastic ({integral} dE), and inelasticneutron-scattering studies of the antiferromagnetic spin correlationsin La/sub 2-//sub x/Sr/sub x/CuO{sub 4} with x varying between 0.02 and0.18. The crystals, which were grown in three different laboratories,exhibit behavior that varies smoothly with x. In all cases, antiferromagneticcorrelations with a scattering amplitude corresponding to a fully occupiedCu/sup 2+/ square lattice are observed. However, the Neel state is destroyedby the doping and spin-spin correlation lenght {xi} is quite short, varyingfrom {similar_to}35 to {similar_to}8 A as x varies between 0.02 and 0.18;the local order is, however, the same as in pure La{sub 2}CuO{sub 4}.The fluctuations are dynamic in character as in La{sub 2}CuO{sub 4} abovethe Neel temperature T/sub N/. To a first approximation, {xi} = 3.8/{radical}x A, the average separation between the holes introduced bythe Sr/sup 2+/ doping. The x = 0.08 sample exhibits superconductivitywith T/sub c/ = 10 K and with a Meissner fraction exceeding 15% at 5K; no important differences in the magnetic scattering are observed inthe normal and superconducting states. In an appendix we present additionaldata on the spin dynamics in pure La{sub 2}CuO{sub 4} at T = 300 K ina sample with T/sub N/ = 235 K.</TEXT></DOC>
