The radio said a military correspondent with the official AfghanBakhtar news agency said another 22 people were injured in theattack on residential areas of the southern city over the weekend.   Soviet troops left Kandahar on Aug. 15 as part of the withdrawalof an estimated 100,000 Red Army soldiers under an accord signed inGeneva. The pullout of the troops, which invaded Afghanistan in1979 to support the Marxist government, is to be completed by Feb.15.   Both the Soviets and the Afghans have accused Pakistan ofviolating the Geneva agreement by harboring and arming Moslemguerrillas.   Pakistan has charged the Soviet-backed Afghan government withviolating its airspace more than 150 times since the May 15 accordwas signed.   Radio Kabul said the Afghan government filed a complaint withPakistan's representative in Kabul, charging Pakistan withsupporting a guerrilla attack on Asadabad in the northeasternprovince of Kunar. Eight people died in that attack, which RadioKabul said occurred on Friday.   In another development, a Japanese free-lance photographer waskilled over the weekend by a mine on a road in eastern Afghanistanwhere Moslem guerrillas and government troops were fighting, rebelsreported.   The woman, identified as Naoko Nanjo, 30, was covering aguerrilla operation on the road between Kabul and the city ofJalalabad, 75 miles from the Pakistan border, the rebels saidSunday.   Japanese Embassy officials in Islamabad said they also hadreceived the report but were unable to confirm it.   If correct, Ms. Nanjo would be at least the sixth Westernjournalist killed while covering the 9-year-old war between Mosleminsurgents and Soviet-backed Afghan government troops.   During the weekend operation, the guerrillas captured seven armyposts along a 21 mile stretch of the highway, killing 39 troops andcapturing 12. Two guerrillas were killed and five were wounded, thespokesman said.</TEXT></DOC>
