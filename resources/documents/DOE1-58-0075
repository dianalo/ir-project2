Pipelines and gas utilities are finding themselveswith commitments to purchase gas at relatively high prices on a take-or-paybasis but their expected market has not developed. Rather, the majorusers to whom they were looking as customers for these gas commitmentsare often buying their own gas in competition with the pipelines. Toput the US natural gas system into perspective the paper briefly reviewsthe functions performed at each step of the production and delivery chain.Direct gas purchasing can be looked at as backward integration alongthe supply chain. As such, there are several levels to which the backwardintegration activity can be taken with possibly satisfactory returnsat each level. These are discussed. Direct purchasing of gas is not easy.Considerable purchasing and administrative effort will be required, but30% savings can be attained. Backward integration can be carried to almostany level approaching, and even including, the actual production activity.In most cases attractive savings in fuel costs can be obtained withoutinvesting significant amounts of capital.</TEXT></DOC>
