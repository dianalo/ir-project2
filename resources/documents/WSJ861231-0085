The holding company's air cargo unit also named two new senior vice presidents and announced the resignations of other executives.    The cost reduction program eliminates through dismissals and attrition 124 employee positions out of a work force of 6,100, and reduces salaries for the unit's 2,600 nonunion employees by 5% to 15%. The plan also calls for employee vacations to be shortened and for all company-paid automobiles operated in the U.S. to be eliminated.    In return for the wage and benefit concessions, Tiger extended its profit-sharing plan, which distributes 15% of the profit after the company's first $10 million in earnings, to nonunion general and administrative employees. In addition, Tiger extended its employee stock-ownership plan to those employees.    The cost reduction program is in keeping with Tiger's stated goal of keeping its Flying Tiger unit operating by reducing labor costs, restructuring a large portion of the unit's $550 million debt and devising a more competitive marketing program.    Tiger's competitive position has been hurt by a recent increase in transpacific air cargo service by other companies. Flying Tiger also transports military personnel and their families. The holding company reported a loss of $55.5 million for the latest nine months on revenue of $811.1 million, compared with a loss of $38.2 million on revenue of $833.1 million in the year-earlier period.    Flying Tiger senior vice president and general counsel, Lawrence Nagin, said the nonunion salary and benefit cut &quot;is the last major component of the cost reduction program.&quot; The debt restructuring is currently &quot;in process,&quot; he said. Mr. Nagin declined to comment further about the restructuring.    Last month, a similar profit-sharing and stock-ownership program was extended to Flying Tiger's unionized pilots and later to its unionized machinists and flight attendants, in return for wage and benefit concessions.    As previously reported, Flying Tiger's pilots accepted a 3 1/2 year package of wage and benefit concessions that included a 25% pay cut, in return for a share in the unit's profits and an employee seat on the unit's board. The unit's machinists accepted a three-year package that called for a 15% pay cut and a reduction in benefits and changes in work rules. Terms of the agreement with the unit's flight attendants weren't disclosed.    The pilots' agreement is expected by industry sources to save the company at least $37 million a year. Mr. Nagin declined to comment on the amount these latest cost reductions would save the company.    Flying Tiger named James A. Cronin, formerly senior vice president of the unit's domestic division, to the new position of senior vice president, marketing. Edwin H. Wallace, formerly senior vice president, contract programs in the Atlantic and Latin American regions, was named senior vice president, international sales and service, also a new position. Their new responsibilities will include their former duties.    In addition, the company said Albert O. Hicks, senior vice president, Atlantic region, and Harold M. Woody, senior vice president, technical operations, have resigned, and Rolf Bodenburg, vice president, taxes, retired. Mr. Nagin declined to explain the reason for their departures, and said the company may not fill the vacancies. </TEXT></DOC>
