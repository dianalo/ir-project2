Despite an enormous amount of rhetoric everywhere these days about our trade problem with Japan, only Mr. McGurn's article touches on what I regard as the real essence of the problem: Japanese agriculture.    The Diet is a one-house legislature apportioned by district rather than population (like the Senate, as opposed to the House). This means that Japanese farmers have tremendous control over Japanese politics. Food prices in Japan take 40% or more of the average person's wage. With housing taking another 40% and the fact that the Japanese are great savers, they are left with almost no discretionary income. This is why they cannot develop a domestic market. They don't have money to spend, except a small amount of savings that they spend only on special occasions, or for unusual bargains.    Japanese farmers on the other hand live very well. So we have a situation in which a few Japanese farmers are holding millions from Tokyo to Osaka hostage to exorbitant food prices. If Japan imported cheap food from the U.S. and other countries, as Hong Kong does, food would only be 10% of expenses for the Japanese. This would give them 30% for spending on the consumer goods they now sell to us and the rest of the world. The downside is that thousands of rural Japanese rice bowls would have to be broken.    How can Prime Minister Nakasone do this, when the farmers control the Diet? It would be political suicide. If Japan were to change its constitution to a two-house Diet, with one house apportioned by population, the world's problem with Japan would evaporate in a year, by itself. The only question is how to do it.    William P. Stenwick   Berkeley, Calif.</TEXT></DOC>
