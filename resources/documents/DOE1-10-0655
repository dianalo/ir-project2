Themodel is intended to be used in assessments of the radiological consequencesof both routine and accidental releases. The model consists of a seriesof inter-connected compartments representing atmosphere, soil, plantsand grazing animals. In addition, the transfer of tritium into drinkingwater is considered. Rates of movement of tritium between the compartmentswere derived following an extensive review of experimental data and areexpressed as transfer coefficients. Throughout each stage of the model,attempts are made to estimate the rates of formation and movement oforganically bound tritium, OBT, which has a significantly longer retentiontime in both man and the environment. The significance of OBT as a contributorto doses is assessed. The paper also outlines the results of a comparisonbetween the predictions of the model in a continuous release situationwith those of a specific activity model. A comparison with the resultsof other dynamic models is also made.</TEXT></DOC>
