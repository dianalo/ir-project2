Treasury bond yields moved above 9% for the first time in more than two months, and the stock market rally derailed. Oil company and gold mining stocks surged, however, amid the prospects of higher profits following the commodity-price increases.    In the oil markets, the price of U.S. crude oil shot above $22 a barrel on spot and futures markets, although analysts said further gains are unlikely unless there is an attack on Persian Gulf shipping.    The reaction of the markets was triggered by Iranian threats to avenge the deaths of hundreds of Iranian pilgrims in a weekend clash with police in the Moslem holy city of Mecca in Saudi Arabia. Iran vowed, among other things, to overthrow the Saudi royal family and seize its oil wealth.    Coupled with new Iranian naval maneuvers in the Strait of Hormuz, the threats raised the specter of a disruption of the flow of oil from the Persian Gulf.    &quot;The Iranian-Saudi level of tension is one of the most serious in a decade,&quot; said Edward Krapels, president of Energy Security Analysis Inc., a Washington, D.C., oil consulting firm.    But unless there is an actual disruption in supplies of petroleum from the Middle East, the current tension may be setting the stage for another oil-price collapse, oil economists said. For despite ample world-wide supplies, companies fearing an interruption of deliveries are currently rebuilding inventories.    &quot;When the crisis subsides, we'll see companies dumping oil,&quot; said Hossein Tahmassebi, chief economist for Ashland Oil Inc. &quot;This could bring about a very rapid decline in crude oil prices later on this year.&quot;    September crude at the New York Merc closed at $22.16 a barrel, up 79 cents. Gasoline and heating oil futures prices also rose sharply, jumping one cent or more a gallon. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 14.99, to 2557.08, despite gains in several oil-related issues in the average. Meanwhile, the dollar closed in New York at its highest level in 6 1/2 months against the West German mark and it was higher as well against the Japanese yen. Gold jumped $13 an ounce to $477.10 on the Commodity Exchange in New York.    Gasoline consumers, however, aren't likely to see much of a price change at the pump for several weeks, and then only about two cents more a gallon. &quot;Only if crude prices go much higher would there be a significant jump at the pump,&quot; said Robert Boslego, executive vice president at Boslego Corp., a Winchester, Mass., oil consulting firm.    Indeed, severe competitive conditions in world petroleum markets are currently working against &quot;pass-throughs&quot; of the higher crude costs to fuel consumers. That is underscored by the inability so far of refiners to recover all their higher costs from crude-price increases earlier this year.    Though wholesale quotes on gasoline and other fuels have been rising -- by as much as seven cents a gallon this year -- they still lag the increasing costs of crude oil to refiners. Crude-oil prices generally are up as much as $4 to $6 a barrel this year, equivalent to 10 cents to 12 cents a gallon on product prices if the refiners had been able to pass through their higher costs in full.    As a result, oil-market specialists said, the latest crude-price run-up will again narrow refining profit margins, which had been improving in recent weeks. &quot;Eventually, this will put pressure on product prices to go up if it (the crude-price runup) is more than just a speculative blip,&quot; said Al Bassano, managing editor of Oil Buyers' Guide.    Despite the Iranian threats, however, some oil specialists suggest that even if supplies from the Persian Gulf were cut off, the free world's oil supply initially wouldn't be affected much.    Mr. Krapels of Energy Security Analysis said, for instance, that the approximately five million barrels, representing one-tenth of free world consumption, that pass through the gulf daily could be replaced easily for at least 30 days by drawing on strategic petroleum reserves held by the U.S., West Germany and Japan.    &quot;That pretty well replaces the worst-case scenario for at least a month,&quot; Mr. Krapels said.    The Iranian threats against Saudi Arabia also could unravel the cooperation between the two that has been responsible for the recent consensus in the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, some analysts said.    The past two OPEC meetings have been successful largely because of the remarkable unity between the two nations, they said.    &quot;If the Iranians make more threats, the Saudis could remind them about what happened last year,&quot; said Nauman Barakat, energy futures analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham andamp; Co. in New York. As OPEC's largest producer, the Saudis -- opposing Iran's call for higher prices -- in late 1985 touched off a price war by increasing production that led to last year's oil-price collapse.    In the meantime, said Ian Gibson, vice president at Kleinwort Grieveson Securities in New York, &quot;the ball is back in the Iranians' court.&quot;    And beyond the political tensions, the surge in crude prices also is putting pressure on OPEC to produce more. Output is currently known to be more than 18 million barrels a day and is estimated by some to be approaching 19 million barrels a day. That compares with a ceiling of 16.6 million barrels a day that OPEC set for the 1987 second half. &quot;OPEC is producing far in excess of what the companies buying the oil really need,&quot; said Ashland's Mr. Tahmassebi.    OPEC typically produces above its ceiling. But oil analysts say that even though world oil demand is rising at a rate of between 0.5% and 1% this year the call for OPEC oil will be less in the second half than current production rates would suggest. Oil companies -- concerned about a possible interruption -- currently are rebuilding inventories again after drawing them down for much of this year, and may need less oil in coming months.    Paul Mlotok, international oil analyst at Salomon Brothers Inc., estimates that OPEC output of 18.1 million barrels a day in the third quarter and 18.6 million barrels a day in the fourth quarter would lead to inventory buildups that would fully offset the draw-downs of the first half of the year.    At the beginning of 1987, however, world oil inventories were considered to be much too high -- by some 200 million to 250 million barrels. Before the latest buildup began, inventories had come down by at least 200 million barrels and were considered to be at &quot;normal&quot; levels. Currently, however, some oil-company planners say those inventory levels have been exceeded by about 100 million barrels.    Many oil executives are concerned that the rise in inventories may bring on new problems for the industry as well as for OPEC. &quot;The market is setting itself up for another price decline because of the anxiety purchases,&quot; said Thomas Burns, manager of Chevron Corp.'s economics group.    &quot;This inventory building has to be worked off eventually,&quot; said Joseph C. Story, president of Gulf Consulting Services and a former official of Arabian American Oil Co. He foresees slim chance of any closing of the Persian Gulf to oil tankers. Even if that happened, he says, such a closing couldn't last for more than two weeks.    The prospect of such a closing led to frenzied trading of crude oil for September delivery on the New York Merc yesterday. By mid-morning, it hit the day's high of $22.67, up $1.30.    &quot;You couldn't find any sellers,&quot; a trader said.    However, prices were pared amid profit-taking throughout the afternoon, leading analysts to suggest that an actual attack in the Persian Gulf was needed to spark further sharp rallies.    &quot;The market is . . . on the verge of boiling, but I don't think it will boil over unless we see a consummation of some sort of confrontation in the gulf,&quot; said Smith Barney's Mr. Barakat.    On the spot, or noncontract, oil market, the price of West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark U.S. crude, rose 80 cents a barrel to $22.15. And North Sea Brent, an abundantly traded European crude, surged 85 cents a barrel to $20.80.    Mehdi Varzi, senior oil analyst in London for Kleinwort Grieveson and a former Iranian diplomat, said he doesn't &quot;totally exclude an Iranian attempt to bomb a U.S. ship accompanying Kuwaiti oil tankers&quot; in the Persian Gulf.    As a result, Mr. Gibson said, &quot;the chances of seeing $25 oil are much greater than the odds of seeing $17 oil.&quot;    ---                      SURGING OIL STOCKS                          POINT       CLOSING                          CHANGE       PRICE        VOLUME    Atlantic Richfield    +2 1/4         98        1,128,800    Chevron               +1 1/2         62        1,472,500    Exxon                 +3 3/8         97 1/2    1,495,400    Mobil                 +2 3/8         54 7/8    1,976,900    Pennzoil              unch.          73          121,400    Phillips Petroleum    +  1/2         18 3/8    2,116,400    Royal Dutch           +2            140 1/2      480,400    Texaco                +  1/2         46 3/4      821,400</TEXT></DOC>
