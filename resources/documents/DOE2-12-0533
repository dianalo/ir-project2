<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-12-0533 </DOCNO><TEXT>An E parallel B end-loss ion spectrometer from the Livermore TMX-U tandemmirror experiment was installed on Tara for high-resolution ion spectroscopy.This diagnostic contains parallel electric and magnetic fields, separatingthe masses and energies of the ions over 128 collector plates. The ionenergy distribution nominally yields confining potentials and parallelion temperatures. Additional experiments have diagnosed the resonanceposition of the central cell ion cyclotron heating, rf enhanced lossesof high-energy sloshing ions in the axicell (''plug''), and observationof MHD instabilities at higher time resolution (20 kHz).</TEXT></DOC>
