SULLIVAN: So, you're Colonel North?   NORTH: Yes, sir, I am.   SULLIVAN: It's traditional to start with stating your full nameand _   NORTH: Oliver Laurence, with a U, North.   SULLIVAN: Colonel North, it's been two and a half years or sosince you've left the National Security Council in November 1986,hasn't it?   NORTH: Yes, sir, it has. ...   SULLIVAN: Now, describe for the jury the circumstances of yourhaving been assigned to the National Security Council?   NORTH: I was a student enrolled in the Naval War College whichis the commanding staff course as a major and one afternoon I waspulled out of class and told to come down and interview here inWashington with a number of general officers for an assignment inWashington. I did so, of course, and found myself interviewing withthe commandant of the Marine Corps, I guess that day or the nextday, and the secretary of the Navy and was sent over to the WhiteHouse to interview with the national security advisor.   SULLIVAN: Did you ever ask for the assignments?   NORTH: No, sir, I told each one of them along the line that Iwould prefer to go back to the Marines which is where I thought mytalents were. ...   SULLIVAN: Is it fair to say that your work in the five and ahalf years you were there, Colonel North, was focused on threebasic areas, one of which would be the secret project which hasnever been revealed and is not part of the case and the other twowould be counter terrorism and Central America problems?   NORTH: Yes, sir, those would be the three principal areas ofresponsibility. It didn't come all at once but it came in phases....   SULLIVAN: Tell us at this point about your relationship withWilliam Casey, the director of the Central Intelligence Agency asof the spring of 1984? First off, tell the jury who he was. They'veheard a lot about him, but who he was from your point of view?   NORTH: Director Casey was in my humble estimation a remarkableman. He was _ at age 70 plus had more energy than I have or eventhese lawyers of mine. He was able to go a full day of work at 12,14 hours a day. ... And he was also, as he frequently remindedpeople around him a, and no offense intended counsel, but he was avery good lawyer and he reminded people of that.   SULLIVAN: What was your relationship to him on a business level?You're a young Marine officer and he's a Cabinet officer.   NORTH: It was _ notwithstanding what others have said _ I didnot consider Director Casey to be a friend or a buddy or anythinglike that. He was a man that I respected and admired. ... I believeit was one of subordinate to a superior.   SULLIVAN: Did there come a time in 1984 when the CIA was gettingout of the business of assisting the freedom fighters that you werestepping in to fulfill that kind of a role?   NORTH: Well, I was not stepping in. I was basically broadening _Marines, I guess, want to volunteer for things but I _ I believe _if Director Casey and what he and Mr. McFarlane said was that thecase was, and that's all I have to go on was what they said to me,as this political dispute got worse in the spring of 1984 thepresident had chaired a number of meetings of what was called whenI worked down there the National Security Planning Group. ... Thatgroup met a number of times in the spring looking for alternativesto how we were going to continue to support the resistance. Iattended a number of those meetings as the note taker, not as aparticipant. ... It was very clear that they wanted to find someway of continuing the support ... that the President was adamantthat those people that we had put in the field, that we had armedand equipped and sent into combat, should not be abandoned.   As a consequence of one of those meetings, Mr. McFarlane told meto, first of all, make contact with a resistance leader in CentralAmerica. ... I was told to go to Director Casey, find out which ofthese resistance leaders should receive funding and to get foreignaccounts into which to put that money. I did so.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
