History will not forget us. Thepeople will not forget us,'' a student leader shouted through amegaphone to students in the 100-acre square, China's symbolic seatof power.   Trucks filled with soldiers circled the square to act as abarricade, but marchers swarmed onto the trucks.   They shouted ``Welcome 38th Army!'' and handed out leaflets tosoldiers explaining their demands for sweepings changes in China'sautocratic system, including press freedom and accountability ofthe country's leaders.   The trucks were immobilized by the mob, and within minutes thevast square was turned into a sea of waving white-and-red studentbanners and protesters chanted pro-reform slogans.   The students did not try to occupy the square but continuedtheir march down Changan Boulevard, the capital's mainthoroughfare. They then headed back to their campuses, declaringthey had scored a victory by reaching the square.   While the march was going on, the government partially accededto the students' demand for dialogue, saying it was ready to holdtalks with them ``at any time.'' But the statement said talks wouldhave to be conducted through official student organizations, whichthe protesters have rejected.   The evening television news carried lengthy official commentsreiterating the government's pre-march statements condemningstudent-generated ``turmoil.''   ``The broad masses of students ... want to promote democracy andend corruption. That we understand and are in agreement with,'' theBeijing city government said. ``But a minority of people ... rejectthe leadership of the party and government and want to return ourcountry to the chaos of the Cultural Revolution.''   The 1966-76 Cultural Revolution was a leftist campaign thatturned into near civil war.   The Communist Party and Beijing government on Wednesday issuedstern warnings that the student protests, now in their 11th day,are illegal and further street demonstrations would be crushed.   But students and a growing hoard of supporters pushed their waythrough police barriers across half a dozen intersections along thenine-mile route from campuses in northwest Beijing to the center ofthe city.   When three truckloads of armed police pulled up at oneintersection, they were surrounded by a crowd shouting ``Peoplelove the people's police, the people's police love people.''   By the time the students reached the square, more than eighthours after the march began, they were far outnumbered by workersand residents had who joined them, and the soldiers who had beenguarding the square faded out of sight.   Thousands of people leaned out windows and cheered as themarchers surged by. Kindergarten children stood at the gate oftheir school and applauded, and patients wearing bathrobes emergedfrom a hospital to accept pamphlets the students were handing out.   Students with arms linked sang the national anthem and shouted``Long live democracy.''   Others shouted ``Down with bureaucracy, down with corruption,''oft-repeated phrases during the demonstrations and class boycottsthat have shaken the communist government.   Student leaders called on students from dozens of Beijinguniversities to march to Tiananmen Square to protest harshgovernment statements condemning their campaign for democracy.   The government has accused the student activists of a ``plannedconspiracy'' to overthrow the government.   The students have called for Premier Li Peng to resign and saysenior leader Deng Xiaoping, 84, is too old to rule. But most saytheir campaign is not anti-government.   They have appealed for free speech and press, an end to rampantcorruption in government and more funding for education.   ``Strongly support the good leaders of the party,'' read onebanner.   The demonstrations were sparked by the April 15 death of oustedCommunist Party chief Hu Yaobang, a reformer.   The demonstrations have been much larger, and gained far morepopular support, than pro-democracy student demonstrations of1986-87 that led to Hu being ousted for failing to crack down onthe students.</TEXT></DOC>
