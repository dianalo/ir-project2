Clearly, then, something is terribly wrong.    In late May, an Ohio emergency crew treating a fallen heart-attack victim watched its nearby ambulance burst into flame. A month later, an ambulance just back from a run caught fire and charred two others inside a Wisconsin hospital garage. And in August, fire engulfed an ambulance on the sidelines of the Indianapolis Colts' practice field and burned the driver.    In all, about 180 ambulances have caught fire since 1986, some 60 of them this year. More than 200 others have developed problems that could have led to fires.    But that's not the worst part.    In the same time period, Ford Motor Co., which makes the basic chassis on which virtually all ambulances are based, twice recalled the vehicles for modifications to prevent fires. And all along, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has, at least officially, had the problem under investigation.    Yet the conflagrations have continued. As a result, what was once scarcely imaginable has become one of the most intractable and emotionally charged automotive safety hazards of recent times.    Ford has quit making new ambulance chassis with gasoline engines, using only diesels, which use less volatile fuel. Even with that switch, however, it will take years for all current models to fade away. Just now, Ford is recalling the old vehicles once again for new repairs that it insists this time will do the trick. With the onset of colder weather, fire incidents have waned, as they did the past two fall-winter seasons. But even so, just last Thursday evening another ambulance with a Ford chassis caught fire in Richmond, Va., while its crew was picking up a patient inside his house. The unoccupied ambulance and its equipment, worth $120,000, were destroyed.    So far, apparently no emergency patient has died or been harmed because of the fires -- although 20 medical staffers have been burned and at least one heart-attack victim may have had a better chance of survival if her trip to the hospital hadn't been delayed by a fire. &quot;What has us all worried,&quot; says Larry Jordan, president of the National Association of State Emergency Medical Services Directors, &quot;is that our luck will run out.&quot;    Critics allege corporate and regulatory indifference. &quot;Ford is worried about the overall cost as opposed to safety,&quot; charges Warren Isman, president of the International Association of Fire Chiefs. The government &quot;has been very slow-paced,&quot; complains Robert Forbuss, president of the American Ambulance Association. Both chide the NHTSA and Ford for not spending more time and money earlier on causes and solutions and for not better informing owners. They also criticize Ford for not better supporting its dealers during the recall process.    Ford and federal regulators defend their efforts to solve what they say is a technically and bureaucratically complex problem. &quot;We are really trying hard on this one,&quot; says John P. King, Ford's chief service engineer. Diane Steed, the NHTSA's administrator, says her agency's progress is slow because &quot;there are so many players.&quot; Instead, Ford and the agency blame mistakes by the dozens of companies that convert Ford chassis to ambulances, and poor maintenance by ambulance owners.    Perhaps the only thing on which all agree is the stress under which modern ambulances operate. At nearly five tons, they are about three times heavier than the ordinary car. They may be charging down the highway at high speeds one minute, then parked for a long period with the engine running to generate electricity for what amounts to a mini-emergency room.    &quot;Back 10 or 15 years, ambulances just took people to the hospital -- they had limited amounts of equipment,&quot; says Mr. King, the Ford official. &quot;Some of them now are really mobile stabilization rooms.&quot;    Modern ambulances are based on chassis Detroit produces for light trucks -- frames with engines, transmissions, wheels, axles and so forth, but usually no body. One of more than 40 small, independent companies then fabricates bodies or cuts up existing ones and adds huge amounts of medical and other gear to create a final vehicle that can easily sell for $70,000.    Ford achieved a near-monopoly in the ambulance-chassis business with longer frames and 30% more powerful engines that match the desire for ever bigger rescue vehicles. It sells 4,000 chassis a year, compared with only a few hundred Dodges and Chevrolets.    In a fire, some of the elaborate equipment can drastically raise the stakes. In June, in Scottsdale, Ariz., fire reaching some on-board oxygen tanks triggered an explosion that hurled the ambulance eight feet, blew off a door that in turn knocked a firefighter into a concrete pole, and scattered debris at least 150 feet. Damage to the nearby Princess Hotel totaled $25,000.    The underlying villain in ambulance fires appears to be unexpected heat buildup in the engine compartment or in the bowels of the vehicle. Certain materials such as rubber catch fire, or excess pressure in the fuel system forces hot gasoline to spurt out somewhere. That's apparently what happened last year in Cincinnati, when an ambulance burned after high pressure pushed fuel out of the carburetor onto hot engine parts. The incident led the city to mothball five other Fords, sue the auto maker and others for $2 million, and buy a new fleet of Chevrolets.    High temperatures also prematurely break down components -- for one thing, mufflers deteriorate faster and can release searing exhaust under the vehicle -- apparently the cause for two fires within three weeks in Chicago this summer.    Fords are especially vulnerable to such problems, some people maintain. As evidence, they cite a Ford recall last year of 200,000 vans built on the same chassis because of 150 fire incidents.    The big engine that is such a selling point throws off more heat to start with. Ford offers a second fuel tank -- another sales point. But it sits in the middle of the chassis, where hot exhaust-system parts also reside. &quot;If Ford didn't have that auxiliary gas tank, it wouldn't have a problem,&quot; argues George Parker, the NHTSA's associate administrator for enforcement.    Fords may get hotter than some vehicles because of engineering changes made in the mid-1980s to meet new Environmental Protection Agency standards. Ford began using two air pumps to burn off exhaust pollutants leaving the engine; General Motors Corp. and Chrysler Corp. need just one on their somewhat smaller light-truck engines. And Ford implemented fuel-system changes because its vehicles seemed to act up on some reformulated gasolines.    Ford concedes that some of these factors might add to heat buildup, but only &quot;incrementally,&quot; a spokesman says. &quot;It's very simplistic to say they're the reason. It's the total system. . . . These are bigger, heavier-duty vehicles.&quot;    Instead, Ford says, it is suffering from the fact that its market share is so big that problems with other makes go undetected statistically. In fact, others do catch fire -- between 1983 and 1987 in New York City, 27 GM-based ambulances did -- -but the incidents have been blamed on poor maintenance, poor wiring or other causes unrelated to the GM chassis.    Ford also blames a number of conditions beyond its control. It says some refiners are making gasoline too volatile, stoking engine temperatures. It says some ambulance owners overload engines with extra equipment like air conditioners and by running engines for long periods while treating patients on board.    However, most important, Ford blames construction errors by some of the small companies that convert chassis into emergency vehicles. The chassis are subject to government regulation, but the process for monitoring converters isn't as stringent. Ford contends it has seen damage to exhaust systems and fuel pipes. Sirens have been installed where they block vents designed to release heat, Ford says.    Mark Van Arnum, president of the Ambulance Manufacturers Division of the National Truck Equipment Association, acknowledges that all ambulance makers may not comply &quot;100% with Ford guidelines.&quot; But he insists that there is &quot;nothing across-the-board that ambulance manufacturers are doing that causes problems.&quot;    If assessing blame for the fires has been difficult, stopping them has been downright daunting. After receiving complaints about fires in 1986, the NHTSA opened an investigation but didn't rush into action. Meantime, Ford and conversion companies argued over which side was responsible and should pay for any recalls.    Ford finally announced a &quot;voluntary modification program&quot; -- it says it wasn't an official recall -- in April 1987. But within three months, it discovered that a new fuel-tank seal it had placed on 250 vehicles cracked too easily, allowing possible leakage. Ford concedes that modification may have actually caused an ambulance fire outside of a Waldorf, Md., hospital.    In July, Ford agreed to a formal recall under federal auspices and a variety of new changes, including heat shields around mufflers and fuel tanks, fuel caps with improved ventilation, and a device to prevent overfilling tanks. However, once again in three months, Ford started over. In October 1987, it called back all 5,000 ambulances it had modified.    But when the weather began warming this year, problems resumed. On March 24, an ambulance in Natural Bridge, Va., burned as a mechanic was driving it to his shop for minor body work. Six months later, the 1988 fire total matched each of the past two years.    One reason is that even then -- 14 months after Ford announced the first official recall -- up to 10% of the vehicles still hadn't been modified at all, and 25% only once.    Dealers are also bungling some recalls. Ford dealers took apart the vehicles of Regional Ambulance Inc. of Fremont, Calif., on three different occasions and then realized they didn't have the right parts to make modifications. &quot;The ambulances have sat for as long as two weeks,&quot; complains Earl Riggs, president. &quot;We're concerned about our legal liability, but we have a contract to provide uninterrupted service 365 days a year.&quot;    After one Franklin County, Ark., ambulance was modified, it wouldn't go faster than 30 miles an hour. It was later learned that during the recall, the fuel filter was clogged. But by then, the county had retrieved its only other ambulance from the dealership before it could be modified and pressed it back into service. While awaiting a new appointment, that ambulance caught fire with a cardiac-arrest patient on board. The patient was unharmed; the vehicle was destroyed.    &quot;This is by far the most complicated (recall program) we've ever done,&quot; says Mr. King in Ford's defense. He cites everything from four months needed to identify owners to differences in vehicles converted by so many different firms.    And problems keep changing. Over the past summer, at least 23 fires involved alcohol-based antifreeze instead of gasoline. In one case, on Sept. 11, an ambulance responding to an emergency near Charlestown, Ind., was destroyed by fire moments after the crew saw steam coming from the engine and smelled antifreeze.    Ford says parts installed by some conversion companies may cause leaks, and also notes that antifreeze can be overly flammable if not mixed with the prescribed amount of water. But the same heat buildup that can trouble fuel systems can crack heater hoses, allowing antifreeze spills. Included in the latest recall, started in September, are new hoses made of silicone that are tougher than rubber ones. (New mufflers, previously promised but unavailable, are also scheduled.)    Once that recall is completed, Ford says, existing ambulances will be reliable. &quot;They are safe,&quot; promises Ford's Mr. King. But others worry. &quot;I'm still very pessimistic about Ford's ability to follow through,&quot; says Mr. Forbuss of the ambulance association.    On the other hand, Ford's long-term strategy, begun late last year, commands more confidence. So far, apparently none of its new ambulance chassis equipped with engines that run on heavy, less volatile diesel fuel have caught fire. Ford has also started monitoring conversion companies much more closely to head off risky changes to its chassis.    However, if every owner of a previous model decided to replace it right now, it would take at least four years at current production rates to turn over the nation's entire fleet.    Besides, ambulances often are expected to last 10 years. Robinson's Ambulance andamp; Oxygen Service in Amityville, N.Y., which had a vehicle burn earlier this year, is still holding on to its remaining four gasoline-powered Fords. They aren't the fanciest models, but &quot;these things are $35,000 apiece,&quot; says Christine Puliselik, the company director of operations. &quot;Where am I supposed to come up with four times $35,000?&quot;    ---             A Sampling of Ford Ambulance Fires  DATE      LOCATION               DESCRIPTION 11/10/88  Richmond, Va.
