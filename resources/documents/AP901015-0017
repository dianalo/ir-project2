FrankAnnunzio into a casualty of the nation's savings and loan crisis.   The 75-year-old Illinois Democrat has rolled over hiscompetition in 12 re-election bids. But now he faces a toughchallenge from a former Chicago cop who is hitting hard atAnnunzio's dealing with the Sandamp;L crisis.   Republican state Sen. Walter Dudycz contends Annunzio, who headsa House subcommittee that oversees thrifts, looked the other waywhile the crisis was brewing.   Annunzio, meanwhile, points his finger at the GOP. He blames theRepublican policies of the White House for the nation's Sandamp;Lproblems.   He was among those who raised questions about the role ofPresident Bush's son Neil as a director of the failed SilveradoBanking, Savings andamp; Loan Association in Denver.   Annunzio proudly displays banners and buttons declaring, ``Jailthe Sandamp;L Crooks.''   Dudycz has responded in kind. His buttons say, ``Jail Annunzio'sSandamp;L Friends.''   Analysts are predicting a close race and see the contest as atest case for voter reaction to the Sandamp;L disaster.   ``People are looking to see if politicians will be blamed forthe Sandamp;L scandal,'' said political analyst Don Rose. ``It's an issuethat's at a low simmer in some places in the country, waiting toboil over.''   Dudycz questioned Annunzio's ethics when it was revealed thatthe congressman over the past decade had accepted more than $50,000in campaign contributions tied to Sandamp;Ls. Annunzio contends there wasno conflict of interest.   ``This is truly a David vs. Goliath race - Frank Annunzio andthe good-old-boy Democratic Party vs. Walter Dudycz and thetaxpayers,'' said Dudycz.   Annunzio insists it's the other way around. He said Republicansare exploiting Democratic crossover voting patterns to try to ousthim from the 11th District, which includes part of northwestChicago and suburban communities.   ``The National Republican Party has earmarked me for defeat,''Annunzio says. ``They thought I would play dead because of my age,but I'm not going to roll over.''   The National Republican Congressional Committee filed acomplaint with the Federal Election Commission claiming thatAnnunzio filed to provide employment information about 20contributors who were associated with a Maryland thrift.   Annunzio's camp maintained the complaint was GOP retribution foran Sandamp;L-related ethics complaint the Democrats filed againstRepublican Rep. Denny Smith of Oregon.   Annunzio also has been criticized for reports that two of hissons-in-law once worked for the savings and loan industry's chieflobbying group, the U.S. League of Savings Institutions. And headmits he once tried to get one of them a position with the FederalHome Loan Bank Board in Chicago.   He contends there ws nothing improper about the request andstresses that the position was non-paying.   Annunzio has attacked Dudycz for being on the Cook Countysheriff's payroll as a deputy while he was a state senator workingprimarily in downstate Springfield.   Both men say their ties to the community will make thedifference. Each uses ethnic working-class roots to seek supportfrom a constituency composed of police officers, firefighters andother blue-collar residents who are first-generation Americans bornof Eastern European parents.   Annunzio - a senior citizen in a community with the highestmedian age of any Illinois district - casts himself as a championof the elderly. He voted against recent federal budget billsbecause they contained cuts in Medicare.   Dudycz, 40, is a relative newcomer to the political scene whocalls himself an ``American's American.'' He attracted attention in1989 when he led daily rallies at the Art Institute of Chicago toprotest an exhibit displaying the U.S. flag on the floor.   The self-styled populist has railed against increases in stateincome taxes and property taxes. He's counting on radio advertisingand door-to-door canvassing to increase his name recognition.   Annunzio, who has spent most of his recent time in Washington,is trying to make up for his absence with advertising bought froman $800,000 campaign war chest.   ``We've basically had to change from a '60s type of campaign toa sophisticated marketing strategy - go from zero to 60 in 6.3seconds,'' said Kevin Tynan, one of Annunzio's sons-in-law and hiscampaign manager.</TEXT></DOC>
