<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-26-1268 </DOCNO><TEXT>A formula is written for the cross section of the A({gamma},d{gamma}')A-2reaction with formation of the 2.23 MeV monochromatic {gamma}' line onthe nucleus A, the A-1 nucleus being unstable and playing the part ofa virtual particle. The derived formula is used to calculate the crosssection and excitation function of the reaction on the /sup 6/Li nucleus.The existing correlation (direct dependence) between the ({gamma},d)and ({gamma},d{gamma}') cross section values for the /sup 7/Li, /sup9/Be, and /sup 14/N nuclei is explained.</TEXT></DOC>
