The U.S. attorney's office in Manhattan made its commentsin response to Mr. Milken's request that Judge Kimba Woodreconsider the sentence she handed down in November. Thejudge has said she would reconsider the sentence based on Mr.Milken's cooperation.</LP><TEXT>   Apparently, that cooperation included a tip from Mr.Milken that led to the government's investigation of anallegedly illegal stock &quot;parking&quot; scheme by Merrill Lynch andamp;Co. to benefit Guarantee Security Life Insurance Co. inFlorida.   Without identifying the parties involved, the governmentdescribed an investigation closely resembling the MerrillLynch inquiry, which was disclosed last week. A personfamiliar with the matter confirmed that it is the MerrillLynch case.   Mr. Milken's attorneys said the government wasunderestimating the importance of Mr. Milken's assistance andurged Judge Wood to sharply reduce the sentence. &quot;During thepast 11 months, Mr. Milken has cooperated extensively withgovernment authorities, particularly concerning industrytrade practices,&quot; said Milken attorney Arthur Liman in acourt filing. &quot;Mr. Milken has provided governmentinvestigators with information about potentially unlawfultrade practices by investment firms in the securitiesindustry.&quot;   Mr. Liman also cited Mr. Milken's record as &quot;a modelprisoner&quot; at the Pleasanton, Calif., prison camp where hebegan serving his sentence March 3. In the filing, Mr. Limansaid that Mr. Milken has been employed at the prison camp asan orderly, &quot;with duties including emptying waste baskets,cleaning toilets and mopping floors.&quot;   Mr. Milken also tutors fellow prisoners who are seekingtheir high-school equivalency diplomas, and Mr. Limanincluded a letter from one of the prison students praisingMr. Milken's dedication.   Prosecutors told Judge Wood that they were disappointedwith Mr. Milken's cooperation, describing the information heprovided as &quot;stale.&quot; They also said that other convictedwhite-collar criminals -- including former arbitrager IvanBoesky and investment banker Dennis Levine -- had been morehelpful.   &quot;While Mr. Milken has devoted substantial time and energyto the process and certain of his disclosures have resultedin the commencement of criminal and (Securities and ExchangeCommission) investigations . . . his cooperation hasn'tresulted in any indictments or convictions,&quot; prosecutors saidin their filing.   The government added that, after 150 hours of interviewinghim, it doesn't believe Mr. Milken &quot;has completely disclosedall the wrongdoing of which he is aware.&quot;   As reported, the SEC is investigating Merrill Lynch'strading with Guarantee Security, which was a Drexel junk-bondclient. According to Florida regulators, Guarantee Securitymade its books look better than they were in 1985, 1986 and1988 by temporarily swapping -- or parking -- millions ofdollars in junk bonds in exchange for safer Treasurysecurities in year-end trades with Merrill.   A Merrill Lynch spokesman yesterday said the firm stronglydenies that the trades constituted parking. People familiarwith the SEC investigation say the agency has heard testimonyfrom about 25 Merrill employees and almost a dozen executivesof Coopers andamp; Lybrand, which was the auditor for the insurancecompany's parent, Transmark USA Inc.   Asked about the government's filing in the Milken case,the Merrill spokesman said: &quot;We have no knowledge of anythingMilken has said to prosecutors in order to ameliorate hiscondition.&quot;   Without disclosing the companies involved, thegovernment's filing describes allegations matching those madeagainst Merrill Lynch. The prosecutors said in the filingthat Mr. Milken wasn't directly involved in the allegedwrongdoing and a criminal prosecution may not result. Thedocument also said that the case &quot;may be more appropriatelypursued&quot; by the SEC.   As for Mr. Milken's other tips, the government said hedisclosed one additional instance in which he personallyengaged in wrongdoing -- but the incident occurred so longago that it couldn't be prosecuted because of the five-yearstatute of limitations.   They said that Mr. Milken also identified three instancesin which Drexel agreed to make up losses to customers, butthat he didn't pin the blame on anyone who could beprosecuted for the wrongdoing.   Several news organizations, including The Wall StreetJournal, objected to the sealing of details in the documents.But Judge Wood appeared sympathetic to the government'sclaims that full disclosure would discourage futuredefendants from cooperating.   Prosecutors also argued that the details needed to be keptsecret to protect current grand-jury investigations. Themotion to seal the documents was made by the defenseattorneys, however, because they are relying on the detailsto back up their claim to the judge that Mr. Milken's helphas been valuable.   Mr. Liman said that in asking that the details be keptsecret, the defense was &quot;acting as a surrogate for thegovernment.&quot; He said that procedurally &quot;we had no alternativebut to ask the court to do the sealing.&quot;   In their filing, Mr. Milken's attorneys disclosed that theU.S. Parole Commission has calculated that Mr. Milken'scrimes caused a total loss to victims of $1 million. Mr.Milken has appealed the commission's findings, the attorneyssaid.   Based on the parole commission's estimate, Mr. Milkenwould have to stay in prison until Oct. 30, 1994, beforebeing eligible for parole, unless Judge Wood reduces thesentence.   The defense attorneys also cited recent federal appealscourt reversals of several white-collar crime cases. Theysaid the reversals indicated how difficult it would have beenfor the government to prove its case against Mr. Milken.</TEXT></DOC>
