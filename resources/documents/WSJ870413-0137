The company said a smaller group, represented by the International Molders and Allied Workers Union, accepted the contract.    Union officials couldn't be reached for comment.    A company spokesman said the strike wouldn't have a major effect because &quot;New York Air Brake isn't a big operation for us.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
