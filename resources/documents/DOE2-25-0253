<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-25-0253 </DOCNO><TEXT>A comprehensive creep experiment on AISI 316 stainless steel involvingirradiation at {approximately}400{degree}C to 130 dpa has been completed.The influence of material and environmental variables on creep and swellingof this steel at {approximately}400{degree}C is shown to have many similaritieswith the behavior exhibited in an earlier experiment conducted at {approximately}550{degree}C,but significant differences are also apparent. These arise because the400{degree}C experiment was clearly conducted in a regime dominated bythe kinetics of point defect recombination whereas the 550{degree}C experimentwas conducted in the sink-dominated regime. At 400{degree}C it is alsofound that a severe embrittlement arises concurrent with {approximately}10%swelling, requiring careful handling of test specimens and structuralassemblies at room temperature. 19 refs., 19 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
