On March 16, 1989, respondentsfiled a request for postponement of the final determination for 60 days.Pursuant to section 705(a)(1) and section 735(a)(2)(A) of the Act, respectively,we aligned the countervailing duty and antidumping duty final determinationsand postponed the final determinations to no later than July 26, 1989 (54FR 14264, April 10, 1989).On May 18, 1989, we delivered a supplemental/deficiency questionnaire tothe Government of Canada (GOC). On May 25, 1989, we received responsesto our questionnaire from Algoma, Sydney Steel Corporation (Sysco), NortrackLtd. (Nortrack), Grand Valley Steel Limited (Grand Valley) and SessenweinInc. (Sessenwein). On May 26, 1989, Sessenwein filed corrections to certainerrors contained in its May 25, 1989, submission.We conducted verification in Canada from May 29 through June 14, 1989,of the questionnaire responses from the GOC, the Provincial Governmentof Ontario, the Provincial Government of Nova Scotia (GONS), Sysco, Algoma,Grand Valley, Sessenwein, C.P. Rail and Nortrack.On June 6, 1989, Nortrack submitted corrections to certain clerical errorsreported during verification. Also on June 6, 1989, Sysco submitted clarificationsto its responses. On June 29, 1989, Algoma submitted clarifications, corrections,and other supplemental information.On July 6, 1989, in accordance with Article 5, paragraph 3 of the Agreementon Interpretation and Application of Articles VI, XVI and XXIII of theGeneral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (the Subsidies Code), we notifiedU.S. Customs to terminate the suspension of liquidation in this investigationas of July 1, 1989.On July 10, 1989, GOC submitted supplemental information on the tariffclassification of contact or ``third'' rails. On July 12, 1989, GOC forwardeda report to the Department which was inadvertently omitted at verification.On July 13, 1989, Algoma filed supplemental information that the Departmenthad requested at verification. On July 14, 1989, Sysco submitted clarificationof information on its debentures which the Department had requested atverification.Petitioner and respondents requested a public hearing in this case on March8, 1989, which was held on July 18, 1989. Petitioner and Sysco filed casebriefs on July 13, 1989, and rebuttal briefs on July 17, 1989. Algoma didnot file a case brief but filed a rebuttal brief on July 19, 1989.<ITAG tagnum="84">Scope of Investigation</ITAG>The United States has developed a system of tariff classification basedon the international harmonized system of Customs nomenclature. On January1, 1989, the United States fully converted to the Harmonized Tariff Schedule(HTS), as provided for in section 1201 <T3>et seq.</T3> of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988.All merchandise entered or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption onor after this date is now classified solely according to the appropriateHTS item numbers. The HTS item numbers are provided for convenience andU.S. Customs Service purposes. The written description remains dispositive.The product covered by this investigation is new steel rail, whether ofcarbon, high carbon, alloy or other quality steel, includes but is notlimited to, standard rails, all main line sections (at least 30 kg. permeter or 60 pounds per yard), heat-treated or head-hardened (premium) rails,transit rails, contact rail(or ``third rail'') and crane rails. Rails areused by the railroad industry, by rapid transit lines, by subways, in minesand in industrial applications.Specifically excluded from this investigation are light rails (rails lessthan 30 kg. per meter or 60 pounds per yard). Also excluded are relay railswhich are used rails taken up from primary railroad track and relaid ina railroad yard or on a secondary track.The product covered by this investigation is currently provided for underthe following HTS subheadings: 7302.10.1020, 7302.10.1040, 7302.10.5000and 8548.00.0000. Prior to January 1, 1989, such merchandise was classifiableunder items 610.2010, 610.2025, 610.2100 and 688.4280 of the ``Tariff Schedulesof the United States Annotated'' (TSUSA).<ITAG tagnum="84">Analysis of Programs</ITAG>For purposes of this determination, the period for which we are measuringsubsidies (``the review period'') is calendar year 1987 for Algoma andApril 1, 1987-March 31, 1988 for Sysco. These review periods correspondto the respective companies' fiscal years. Normally, we would select thecalendar year as the review period for all companies if the companies underinvestigation had different fiscal years. We have chosen Sysco's fiscalyear as that company's review period in order to measure more accuratelythe subsidies received over time, which have been reported to the Departmenton a fiscal year basis.Petitioner alleged that Sysco is unequityworthy and uncreditworthy. Wehave consistently held that the government provision of equity does not<T3>per se</T3> confer a subsidy. Government equity purchases bestow countervailablebenefits only when they occur on terms inconsistent with commercial considerations.When there is no market-determined price for equity, it is necessary todetermine whether the company was a reasonable commercial investment or,in other words, whether the company was ``equityworthy.''The GONS is the sole owner of Sysco, which it purchased in 1968. Syscohas never issued shares; therefore, we must determine whether Sysco wasequityworthy in each instance when the GONS made an equity infusion. Wedo not reach the question of whether Sysco was equityworthy in 1968. Theinitial purchase of Sysco by the GONS occurred prior to the 15 year periodin which we are examining all the financial assistance received by Syscowhich may have benefited the company during the review period. We are using15 years because it represents the average useful life of assets in thesteel industry as determined by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service's 1977Class Life Asset Depreciation Range System. Use of the IRS tables is inaccordance with past practice and is described in detail in the ``SubsidiesAppendix'' attached to the ``Final Affirmative Countervailing Duty Determinationand Countervailing Duty Order: Cold-Rolled Carbon Steel and Flat-RolledProducts from Argentina,'' (Subsidies Appendix), 49 FR 18006, April 26,1984.Although Sysco's equityworthiness in 1968 and the GONS's equity infusionin 1968 will not be examined, the GONS made additional equity infusionsinto Sysco in the period 1974 through 1988. Therefore, we have reviewedSysco's equityworthiness in each of the years in which it received equitycapital from the GONS during that period.A company is considered unequityworthy if it is deemed unable to generatea reasonable rate of return within a reasonable period of time. In makingour equityworthiness determinations, we assess the company's current andpast financial health, as reflected in various financial indicators takenfrom its financial statements. The indicators we examine include the followingratios: rate of return on total assets and net equity, profit margin onsales, operating loss to fnancial expense, the current and quick ratiosand debt to equity and debt to total assets. We give great weight to thecompany's recent ability to earn a return on total assets and to generatea profit margin on sales as indications of the company's financial healthand prospects. Based on the factors described above, we determine thatSysco was unequityworthy in each year in which it received an equity infusionin the period from 1973 through 1988.Petitioner additionally alleged that Sysco is uncreditworthy. We considera company creditworthy if it appears that it will have sufficient revenuesor resources to meet its costs and fixed financial obligations, absentgovernment intervention. Like our equityworthiness test, to determine thecreditworthiness of a company we analyze the company's past operations,as reflected in various financial indicators calculated from its financialstatements. We give great weight to the company's recent past ability tomeet its financial cost obligations with its cash flow. Based on an analysisof the factors described above, we determine Sysco to be uncreditworthyfor the period from 1973 through 1988.We determine that Sysco is uncreditworthy despite the fact that it hasreceived financing from private commercial sources. We are discountingthe importance of such financing because we have determined that Syscowould not have received this financing but for the guarantees providedby the GOC and the GONS.All of Sysco's debentures and loans are guaranteed by either the federalor the provincial government. (See sections I.A.1., I.C.3. and II.A.) Withrespect to the provincial loan guarantees, Sysco has argued that theseguarantees are not countervailable. In support of their position, respondentscite andSection; 355.44(c)(1) of the proposed Countervailing Duty regulations,published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on May 31, 1989 (54 FR 23366) (to be codifiedat 19 CFR Part 355) (proposed regulations), which states ``[t]he explicitguarantee by a government of a loan to a firm shall not confer a countervailablebenefit if the government is a principal owner or majority shareholderof the firm and it is a normal commercial practice in the country in questionfor owners or shareholders to provide loan guarantees on comparable termsto their firms.''The statement in the proposed regulations embodies the Department's generalpolicy on loan guarantees as exhibited in previous cases. (<T3>See, </T3>``Final Affirmative Countervailing Duty Determination onCarbon Steel Wire Rod from Trinidad and Tobago,'' 49 FR 480, January 4,1984.) However, we note that our past practice has been limited largelyto government guarantees on commercial loans to equityworthy companiesor to government guarantees on loans from government sources. When analyzingloan guarantees to companies that may not be reasonable commercial investments,we believe it is appropriate to use the same ``reasonable investor'' analysisas we would for an equity infusion. Just as a reasonable investor wouldnot purchase stock in an unequityworthy firm, it would not guarantee aloan to a company in such poor financial straits that the guarantor wouldbe bound to lose money. This analysis is consistent with prior cases inwhich we considered the government guarantee to be ``the action of a majorshareholder contributing to its investment in a * * * project.'' <T3>Id. </T3>at 485. In such cases, we have evaluated the loan guaranteesin terms of whether the investment was inconsistent with commercial considerations.<T3>Id. </T3>Based on our analysis of Sysco's financial position, as outlinedearlier under our equityworthy analysis, we determine that the government'sprovision of loan guarantees to Sysco is not a reasonable commercial decision.Based on this analysis, and because these guarantees are limited to a specificindustry, we determine that the government provision of loan guaranteesto Sysco provides a potential countervailable benefit.Our past practice, described in the ``Subsidies Appendix'', for measuringthe benefit conferred by the provision of a government loan guarantee,is to first compare the cost of the government guarantee to the cost thefirm would have paid for a comparable commercial guarantee. If no differencebetween government and commercial guarantee costs is evident, we then comparethe terms of the guaranteed loan to the benchmark financing. We verifiedthat loan guarantees cannot normally be purchased from commercial sources.Consequently, we cannot compare Sysco's treatment against normal commercialpractices in Canada. Therefore, for all of Sysco's guaranteed financingwe analyzed the extent to which the company received more favorable termson its financing than the benchmark financing. (See sections I.A.1., I.C.3.and II.A.)With respect to the calculations of benefits from grants and governmentdebenture and loan guarantees received by Sysco, we used as the discountrate for allocating the benefits over time the benchmark interest ratecalculated for purposes of valuing the subsidy provided on Sysco's debenturesand loans which were guaranteed by either the federal or provincial government.(See sections I.A.1. and I.C.3.) We were unable to use Sysco's weightedcost of capital, which is our preferred method of deriving the discountrate, for the following reasons. In the years 1973-1976, we do not haveinformation on the national average rate of return on equity. In the years1977-1988, either Sysco's equity as a percent of total capitalization wasnegative or Sysco's capitalization in its entirety was negative. Consequently,we could not meaningfully employ our weighted cost of capital formula.Sysco received grants and/or equity infusions, which we are treating asgrants (see section I.C.4.), in every year during the period 1974-1988.In accordance with past practice (<T3>see </T3>``Final Affirmative Countervailing Duty Determination: OilCountry Tubular Goods from Canada'', (<T3>OCTG</T3>), 51 FR 15037, April 22, 1986), for all the programs whichprovided non-recurring grants and for all the benefits received by Syscowhich we treated as non-recurring grants, we first determined if the benefitamount received by Sysco, in each of the years in which the benefit wasreceived, was more than 0.50 percent of the company's total sales for thatyear. In every year, the benefit amount exceeded the 0.50 percent rate;therefore, for all of the grants and equity infusions received by Sysco,we allocated the benefit over the average useful life of equipment in thesteel industry, which is 15 years. Using the above methodology, we alsoallocated over 15 years, unless otherwise specified, the benefit from thegrants received by Algoma.As mentioned in the ``Case History'' section, we verified questionnaireresponses from the two producers and four non-producer exporters. We verifiedthat none of the non-producer exporters received any benefits from theprograms under investigation with respect to steel rails exported to theUnited States. Therefore, the steel rail exports of each respondent non-producerexporter will be subject to the estimated net subsidy of the producer fromwhich it purchased the steel rail. As the best information available, weare assigning the estimated net subsidy rate of Sysco to the one non-respondentnon-producer exporter, Bernard Railtrack Export Inc.Based upon our analysis of the petition, the responses to our questionnaires,verfication, and written comments filed by petitioner and respondents,we determine the following.<ITAG tagnum="84">I. Programs Determined to Confer Subsidies</ITAG>We determine that subsidies are being provided to manufacturers, producersor exporters in Canada of steel rail under the following programs.A. Federal Programs<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Debenture Guarantees Provided to Sysco</ITAG>Sysco issued its Series C debenture in 1973 and its Series D debenturein 1975. Series C was denominated in U.S. dollars, issued for 20 yearsand guaranteed by the GONS. The terms of Series C provided for semi-annualinterest payments and annual principal repayments starting in 1979.Series D was denominated in Canadian dollars, issued for 20 years and guaranteedby the Cape Breton Development Corporation (Devco), a crown corporationof the GOC. The terms of Series D provided for semi-annual interest paymentsand gradually increasing annual principal repayments. No fee was paid forthe GONS or Devco guarantees.These guarantees were provided to one company. Thus, we determined thattheir provision was limited to a specific enterprise. Based on the reasonsexplained in the ``Analysis of Programs'' section pertaining to the governmentprovision of debenture and loan guarantees, Sysco's debenture guaranteesare countervailable to the extent that the terms are more favorable thanthe benchmark financing.As described in the ``Analysis of Programs'' section, we have determinedthat Sysco has been uncreditworthy throughout the period 1973-1988. Inthe case of uncreditworthy companies, we assume that private lenders eitherwould not provide loans to such companies or would require a premium interestrate. (See the Subsidies Appendix.) In selecting an appropriate benchmark,we must formulate an approximation of the premium interest rate a commercialsource of financing would charge an uncreditworthy company. The first stepin the formulation of such an interest rate is to determine the highestlong-term fixed interest rate a marginally creditworthy borrower wouldhave to pay in order to receive a loan.The next step is the calculation of a risk premium. This amount representsthe difference in risk between a marginally creditworthy company and anuncreditworthy company. In previous cases (<T3>See </T3>``Certain Carbon Steel Products from Brazil: Final Resultsof Countervailing Duty Administrative Review'', 52 FR 829, January 9, 1987),we have derived this risk premium by examining the difference between Moody'sAaa and Baa corporate bond rates and calculating the percentage this differencerepresents of the prime interest rate in the United States. We have foundthat the risk premium as calculated by this approach is 12 percent. Ifthe financing is not in U.S. currency, this percentage is then appliedto the prime interest rate in the country concerned to derive a comparablemeasure of the risk premium in the local economy. The final step in ourcalculation of the appropriate benchmark for an uncreditworthy companyis to add the risk premium to the highest long-term fixed interest ratecommonly available to a marginally creditworthy company.For the series D debenture denominated in Canadian dollars, we chose forthe highest long-term fixed interest rate commonly available to a marginallycreditworthy company the rate on BBB Canadian corporate bonds. To thiswe added the risk premium, calculated as 12 percent of the Canadian primerate. We used the resulting interest rate as our benchmark for the debenturedenominated in Canadian currency.With respect to the series C debenture denominated in U.S. dollars, wefollowed the same general approach described above in constructing a benchmark.We used the rate on Baa U.S. corporate bonds as the highest long-term fixedinterest rate commonly available to a marginally creditworthy company and12 percent of the U.S. prime rate for the calculation of the risk premium.Based on this methodology, we derived a benchmark for the debenture denominatedin U.S. dollars. In addition, we calculated an effective interest rateon this debenture to account for the difference in the face value of theissue and the actual amount received by Sysco for the issue.We compared the two benchmarks formulated above to the interest rates receivedon the two series of debentures issued by Sysco and found that the interestrates on Sysco's debentures were lower than the respective benchmarks.Therefore, we determine that the guarantees provided to Sysco by the GOCand the GONS are countervailable.To determine the benefit, we calculated the payment differential betweenthe benchmark financing and the guaranteed debentures using our long-termloan methodology which is described in the ``Subsidies Appendix'' and hasbeen described in numerous previous cases. (<T3>See</T3>, for example, ``Final Affirmative Countervailing Duty Determination;Certain Granite Products from Spain'', 53 FR 24340, June 28, 1988.) Weallocated the benefit over 20 years using as the discount rate the benchmarkinterest rates described above. (We were not able to base the discountrate on Sysco's weighted cost of capital for the reasons discussed in the``Analysis of Programs'' section.) We then divided the benefit attributableto the review period by Sysco's total sales and calculated an estimatednet subsidy of 1.13 percent <T3>ad valorem</T3> for Sysco.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Forgiven Wharf Loan</ITAG>In 1972, the federal government provided Sysco with a loan to constructa loading wharf, which was completed in June 1978. Beginning in June 1979,Sysco was to make twenty equal payments to pay off the total advances fromthe government consisting of principal and interest accrued during theconstruction of the wharf. The twenty equal payments did not include anyadditional interest charges beyond 1978. No payments on the loan were made.In May 1981, the federal government announced that the loan would be forgiven.In 1982, Sysco removed the outstanding principal and estimated accruedunpaid interest from its long-term liabilities as shown in its auditedfinancial statement.We determine that the benefit provided by the loan forgiveness is countervailablebecause it was provided to a specific enterprise. Furthermore, we determinethat for the period 1979 through 1981, the year in which the loan was forgiven,the loan was interest-free. Therefore, we have added to the original balancethe interest that would have been paid for the period 1979 through 1981at the benchmark interest rate, described in the previous section. We treatedthis entire amount as a grant given in 1981. Using the declining balancemethodology and the benchmark rate, we allocated the benefit over 15 years,for reasons explained in the ``Analysis of Programs'' section of this notice,and divided the benefit attributable to the review period by Sysco's totalsales. The calculated estimated net subsidy rate is 2.36 percent <T3>ad valorem </T3>for Sysco.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Regional Development Incentives Program (RDIP)</ITAG>The RDIP was administered by the Department of Regional Economic Expansion(DREE) until its replacement with the Industrial Regional Development Program(IRDP) in 1983. It was established in 1969 for the purpose of creatingstable employment opportunities in certain regions of Canada where employmentand economic opportunities are chronically low, particularly the Atlanticprovinces. The DREE offered incentives based on a case-by-case evaluationof capital investment projects. Projects that could proceed without RDIPassistance were ineligible. Assistance was provided in the form of grantsor loans guarantees.Although the program was terminated in 1983, RDIP grants were providedto both Sysco and Algoma prior to its termination. We determine that theRDIP grants are countervailable because the benefits are limited to companieslocated within certain regions of Canada. (<T3>See </T3>also OCTG and ``Final Affirmative Countervailing Duty Determination:Certain Fresh Atlantic Groundfish from Canada'' (Groundfish), 51 FR 10041,March 24, 1986.)Algoma received two RDIP grants; Sysco received four RDIP grants. We verfiedthat one of the grants received by Algoma was specifically tied to theproduction of products not under investigation. Therefore, consistent withpast practice (see OCTG), we did not include this grant in our calculations.Algoma's other grant was approved in 1972.To calculate the benefit, we used the declining balance methodology. Weused as the discount rate for Algoma the national average long-term interestrate in Canada in 1972. (We were unable to use our weighted cost of capitalformula because we do not have information on the national average rateof return on equity in Canada in 1972.) We used as the discount rate forSysco the interest rate benchmark discussed in section I.A.1. On this basis,we calculated the benefits attributable to the review period and allocatedthem to the respective total sales of Algoma and Sysco. We calculated theestimated net subsidy to be 0.03 percent <T3>ad valorem </T3> for Algoma and 1.10 percent <T3>ad valorem </T3>for Sysco.<ITAG tagnum="81">4. Certain Investment Tax Credits (ITCs)</ITAG>There are a number of categories of ITCs in Canada and varying tax creditpercentage levels within some of the categories. Based on our previousexamination of all the types of ITCs in Canada (See OCTG and Groundfish),we initiated an investigation on the following four types of ITCs: (1)Tax credits of three and 13 percent, above the basic seven percent ratewhich we have previously found non-specific, for investment in ``qualifiedproperty'' located in certain regions of Canada; (2) tax credits for investmentin ``certified property''; (3) tax credits for large companies of ten percentabove the basic 20 percent for investment in capital equipment used forscientific research; and (4) tax credits for investment in transportationand construction equipment.Canadian tax law provides that ITCs may be subtracted from taxes owed,but if no taxes are owed (either because a company is initially in a taxloss position or because only some of the ITCs have been used to satisfyall tax liability), those excess ITCs earned after April 19, 1983, havea refundable, one-time cash value equal to 20 percent of the initial, facevalue of the ITC (40 percent for small businesses).We verified that Sysco, as a provincially-owned corporation, is not liablefor federal tax. Because the company is not liable for federal taxes, itwas not eligible for a refund of taxes under the ITC law.We verified that Algoma benefited from the three percent tax credit, abovethe basic rate of seven percent, for investment in ``qualified property''because it is located in northern Ontario, and that it did not use theother ITCs under investigation. Furthermore, we verified that Algoma didnot owe taxes on the tax return filed in the review period, but that itreceived a refund under the procedures described above.We determine that the three percent tax credit, above the basic rate ofseven percent, for investment in ``qualified property'' is countervailablebecause it is limited to companies located in certain regions of Canada.To calculate the benefit from the ``qualified property'' ITC, we followedour standard tax methodology. Under our tax methodology, we allocate anincome tax benefit claimed on a tax return to the year in which that taxreturn was filed. Algoma received a refund on the tax return filed duringthe review period. Therefore, we consider the amount of the refund attributableto the three percent in excess of the basic rate of seven percent to bethe benefit Algoma received during the review period. We divided this benefitamount by Algoma's total sales for the review period and calculated anestimated net subsidy of 0.02 percent <T3>ad valorem.</T3>B. Joint Federal-Provincial Programs<ITAG tagnum="81">1. General Development Agreements (GDA)</ITAG>GDAs provided the legal basis for various departments of the federal andprovincial governments to cooperate in the establishment of economic assistanceprograms. The GDAs were umbrella agreements which stated general economicdevelopment goals. Ten-year GDAs were signed with most provinces in 1974.Subsidiary agreements were signed pursuant to the GDAs. Subsidiary agreementswere generally between particular federal and provincial government departmentsand addressed certain economic development problems under the jurisdictionof the government agency signatories. These agreements established variousindividual types of economic development programs, delineated administrativeprocedures, and set out the relative funding commitments of the federaland provincial governments. Subsidiary agreements were typically directedat establishing traditional government economic assistance programs, developinginfrastructure, providing for economic development assistance for certainregions within the province, and providing financial assistance to specificindustries or enterprises.Three such subsidiary agreements were signed between the federal governmentand the GONS. Two agreements were specifically established to provide assistanceto Sysco. We determine that funds provided to Sysco under these agreementsare countervailable in their entirety because they provided grants to aspecific enterprise.The third subsidiary agreement primarily provided funds for feasiblityand market studies and funds for the development of industrial parks. Inour Preliminary Determination, we determined that only the GOC's portionof funds under this third subsidiary agreement was countervailable becauseit was limited to companies in a particular region of Canada (<T3>i.e.,</T3> the Province of Nova Scotia). We also stated that the GONS'sportion of funding was not countervailable because the assistance was notlimited to a specific enterprise or industry or group of enterprises orindustries in Nova Scotia. However, we also noted in our Preliminary Determinationthat, although the agreement provided benefits to a wide range and numberof industries, an amendment was made to the agreement, subsequent to itsimplementation, naming Sysco as the specific recipient of new funds notpreviously authorized under the agreement. Consequently, we stated thatwe would examine this amendment in detail to determine whether it constituteda discretionary governmental action which provided a benefit to a specificenterprise.As noted above, the general purpose of the third subsidiary agreement wasfor general feasibility and market studies and the development of industrialparks. No specific companies were named in the original agreement. Theamendment however specifically permitted the provision of funds to Syscofor capital repair. During verification, federal and provincial agreementofficials were unable to provide any specific information concerning thecircumstances surrounding this amendment. Therefore, we are assuming, asthe best information available, that the amendment to the third subsidiaryagreement constituted a discretionary governmental action which provideda benefit to a specific enterprise. Thus, we determine that funds providedto Sysco under the amendment to the third subsidiary agreement are countervailablein their entirety.No assistance to Algoma was provided under the Canada/Ontario GDA or correspondingsubsidiary agreements.We calculated the benefit conferred by the grants using the discount ratefor Sysco referred to above (see section I.A.1.) and our declining balancemethodology. We divided the benefit attributable to the review period bySysco's total sales and calculated an estimated net subsidy of 25.48 percent<T3>ad valorem </T3>for Sysco.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Economic and Regional Development Agreements (ERDA)</ITAG>ERDAs are essentially a continuation of the GDAs. ERDAs were signed withevery province and territory in the early 1980's. Similar to GDA subsidiaryagreements, ERDA subsidiary agreements establish programs, delineate administrativeprocedures and set up the relative funding commitments of the federal andprovincial governments.Two subsidiary agreements were signed between the federal government andthe province of Nova Scotia which related to Sysco. The first providedfor grants to fund the modernization of Sysco's operations. The secondprovided for the funding of economic planning studies throughout the Province,including three feasibility studies which examined different modernizationalternatives for Sysco.We determine that funds provided to Sysco under the first subsidiary agreementare countervailable in their entirety because the agreement provides grantsto a specific enterprise.The monies under the second subsidiary agreement were used to conduct feasibilityand market studies for various projects throughout the Province of NovaScotia. We verified that these funds were provided for such diverse projectsas the development and diffusion of communications and information, theidentification of a site for a harness racing facility, the assessmentof viability of a miniature theme park, and impact studies for rail lineabandonment. Therefore, we determine that the portion of funds providedby the GONS is not countervailable because the assistance is not limitedto a specific enterprise or industry or group of enterprises or industries.We determine that the portion of funds provided by the GOC are countervailablebecause they are limited to companies in a particular region of Canada(<T3>i.e, </T3>the Province of Nova Scotia).The only indirect assistance received by Algoma under the Canada/OntarioERDA is described in the next section.To calculate the benefit we used the same methodology described in the``GDA'' section. We calculated an estimated net subsidy of 6.70 percent<T3>ad valorem </T3>for Sysco.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Iron Ore Freight Subsidy to Algoma</ITAG>Algoma ships sintered iron ore pellets from its mine in Wawa, Ontario toits steel mill at Sault Ste. Marie by rail on the Algoma Central Railway(ACR). The ACR also operates the Agawa Canyon Tour Train which is an importanttourist attraction in Northern Ontario.In 1986, Algoma reconsidered its use of Wawa iron ore because the deliveredcost of Wawa ore was not competitive when compared to the delivered costof ore from alternative sources. We verified that Algoma obtained and analyzedbids from a number of companies capable of trucking its iron ore from theWawa mine. In order to make the delivered cost of Wawa ore competitive,Algoma sought a reduction in ACR's freight rates.If ACR did not reduce its freight rate to a competitive level, Algoma wasconsidering closing its Wawa mine. Such an action would have forced ACRto cease all operations, including its tour train operation. To preservethe continued operation of ACR, the federal and the Ontario governmentsprovided grants to ACR. The grants were made under the ``Canada-OntarioSubsidiary Agreement for Tourism Development'' (COTDA), which is a subsidiaryagreement under ERDA. As a result of these grants ACR was able to chargeAlgoma a lower freight rate.Because the amount of the grants was calculated to permit ACR to chargethe lower freight rate sought by Algoma, we determine that the COTDA grantsprovided an indirect benefit specifically to Algoma. Thus, we determinethat this benefit was limited to a specific enterprise.To calculate thebenefit to Algoma we compared the truck rate Algoma would have been chargedto the reduced freight rate charged by ACR. We divided the difference byAlgoma's total sales and found the estimated net subsidy rate to be 0.19percent. C. Provincial Programs_Province of Nova Scotia<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Grants for Payment of Principal and Interest on Debentures</ITAG>The GONS has provided Sysco with grants to cover principal payments andinterest payments on its long-term debentures since 1982. Because thesegrants are limited to a specific enterprise they are countervailable.Respondents have argued that we should treat these grants as recurringgrants. In determining whether grants are recurring or non-recurring, wemust consider the following factors: (1) Whether the program providingthe benefit is exceptional; (2) whether the program is of longstandingnature; and (3) whether there is any reason to believe that the programwill not continue into the future. (<T3>See </T3>``Final Affirmative Countervailing Duty Determination: LiveSwine and Fresh, Chilled and Frozen Pork Products from Canada,'' 50 FR25,097, June 15, 1985, and Groundfish.)In this case, we determine that these grants are non-recurring for thefollowing reasons. First, the government action of providing these grantsis exceptional because it is not under any particular established provincialprogram and because the provincial legislature must approve the funds eachyear. Moreover, if Sysco had turned a profit, it is unlikely the provincewould have continued to provide the grants. Second, although these grantshave been provided for several years, presumably they will terminate whenthe debentures are paid off in the near future. Third, if Sysco does becomeprofitable in the future, the grants will probably stop. Therefore, wedetermine that these grants are non-recurring grants.To calculate the benefit, we used the same methodology described in the``GDA'' section. The estimated net subsidy is 22.73 percent <T3>ad valorem </T3>for Sysco.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Operating Grants Provided to Sysco</ITAG>The GONS has provided Sysco with operating grants to cover its generaloperating expenses and for capital expenditures. We determine that theseoperating grants are countervailable because they provide funds to a specificenterprise. We further determine that they are non-recurring because theyare not provided under any particular provincial program and because theyare provided according to the irregular financial needs of Sysco.To calculate the benefit, we used the same methodology described in the``GDA'' section. The estimated net subsidy is 19.34 percent <T3>ad valorem </T3>for Sysco.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Long-term Loan Guarantees Provided to Sysco</ITAG>Sysco has a number of five-year loan agreements with several Canadian trustcompanies. The GONS guarantees all of these loans. Interest rates on thesefive-year loans are variable according to the prime or banker's acceptance(BA) rates. Interest is payable monthly. The trust companies have the optionof demanding repayment, in full, of the outstanding principal with 30 daysnotice. Sysco also has the option of repaying, in full, the outstandingprincipal. None of these loans have ever been prepaid, nor have the trustcompanies ever demanded payment before maturity.These guarantees were provided to one company. Thus, we determine thattheir provision was limited to a specific enterprise. For the reasons explainedin the ``Analysis of Programs'' section pertaining to the government provisionof debenture and loan guarantees, Sysco's loan guarantees are countervailableto the extent that the terms are more favorable than the benchmark financing.As described in the ``Analysis of Programs'' section, we have determinedthat Sysco has been uncreditworthy throughout the period 1973-1988. Inthe case of uncreditworthy companies, we assume that private lenders eitherwould not provide loans to such companies or would require a premium interestrate. (<T3>See </T3>the ``Subsidies Appendix''.) In selecting an appropriate benchmark,we must formulate an approximation of the premium interest rate a commercialsource of financing would charge an uncreditworthy company. Our preferredbenchmark for a long-term variable interest rate government guaranteedloan to an uncreditworthy company is the highest long-term variable interestrate commonly available to a marginally creditworthy company in the countryin question, plus the risk premium described in section I.1.A. Statisticalinformation concerning the highest long-term variable interest rate inCanada does not exist. Absent such a rate, we have determined that thebest alternative benchmark is the highest long-term fixed interest ratecommonly available to a marginally creditworthy company in the countryin question. Although in prior cases we have used short-term financingas our benchmark, it is more appropriate to use a long-term benchmark whenit is available. For long-term projects a company will typically requirelong-term financing. Therefore, a company seeking such financing will considerall long-term financing options before turning to short-term financing.And, in the absence of long-term variable rate financing, a company wouldrely on long-term fixed rate financing. For this reason, we determine thata long-term fixed interest rate is the best alternative benchmark whenno variable rate benchmark is available. For this rate, we are using theinterest rate on Canadian BBB bonds to which we have added the risk premium,as is our practice in dealing with uncreditworthy companies.To determine the benefit, we calculated the payment differential betweenthe interest that would have been paid at the benchmark interest rate andthe actual interest paid on each of the guaranteed five-year loans duringthe review period. We then divided the benefit by Sysco's total sales andcalculated an estimated net subsidy of 12.83 percent <T3>ad valorem </T3>for Sysco.<ITAG tagnum="81">4. Equity Infusions Provided to Sysco</ITAG>GONS has made a number of equity infusions into Sysco. As noted in the``Analysis of Programs'' section, we find Sysco to be unequityworthy. Therefore,we determine the equity infusions made by the GONS to be countervailable.We normally calculate the benefit conferred by government equity infusionsinconsistent with commercial considerations by determining the differencebetween the national average rate of return on equity and the rate of returnon equity of the company under investigation. However, Sysco's financialstatements indicate that the entire amount of the GONS's equity capitalhas been consumed. Therefore, the calculation of any rate of return onequity for Sysco would not be a meaningful measure. Furthermore, we believethat even if we could somehow calculate a rate of return on equity forSysco, the difference between Sysco's rate of return, presumably a negativevalue, and the national average rate of return would be so great that the``grant cap'' would be exceeded. Therefore we treated all the equity infusionsreceived by Sysco as grants.We calculated the benefit from the equity infusions using the grant methodologydescribed in previous sections (see, for example, section I.B.1.). We dividedthe benefit attributable to the review period by Sysco's total sales andcalculated an estimated net subsidy of 21.89 percent <T3>ad valorem </T3>for Sysco.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Programs Determined Not To Confer Subsidies</ITAG>We determine that the following programs do not confer subsidies:A. Short-Term Loan GuaranteesThe GONS guarantees all of the demand loans, or lines of credit, providedto Sysco by chartered banks. The guarantees on these demand loans wereprovided to a specific enterprise; however, they are only countervailableto the extent that the terms of the loans are more favorable than the benchmarkfinancing. (See the ``Analysis of Programs'' section of this notice pertainingto the provision of loan guarantees.)Our past practice has been to select as the short-term benchmark the interestrate on the predominant source of short-term financing in the country inquestion. (<T3>See </T3>``Final Affirmative Countervailing Duty Determination: CertainElectrical Conductor Aluminum Redraw Rod from Venezuela'', (Redraw Rod),53 FR 24, 763, June 30, 1988.) Although we obtained interest rate informationon BAs and corporate paper at verification, we established that togetherthese forms of short-term financing only account for twenty percent oftotal short-term financing. Average interest rate information on the remaining80 percent of short-term financing in Canada is not available. We did however,verify that Algoma also has short-term financing, which is comparable toSysco's lines of credit. Therefore, we are using as the best informationavailable in this investigation the interest rate charged Algoma on itsshort-term financing. We chose this rate primarily because of the closecomparability between the two types of financing. When we compare Sysco'srate to this benchmark rate, we find that Sysco's short-term financingis not on terms more favorable than benchmark financing and, therefore,is not countervailable.B. Research Grant Received by AlgomaAt verification, we found that Algoma received a research grant from theGOC under the Industrial Energy Research andamp; Development Program fora project to study sulfur reduction at Algoma's Wawa mine.Research and development grants are considered to confer a countervailablebenefit when they are provided to a specific enterprise or industry orgroup of enterprises or industries and the results of such research anddevelopment are not made available to the public.An examination of the documentation related to this grant demonstratesthat, as a condition of receiving the grant, Algoma was obligated to makethe results of this study available to the public and had to show how thefindings of the study would be beneficial to energy conservation effortsin Canada. Furthermore, we verified that the results of Algoma's studyhave been made public. Therefore, we find that the grants under this researchprogram do not confer a countervailable benefit to Algoma.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Programs Determined Not To Be Used</ITAG>We determine, based on verified information, that the following programswere not used by manufacturers, producers or exporters in Canada of steelrail during the review period. For a full description of these programs,see our Preliminary Determination.A. Federal Programs<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Defense Industry Productivity Program (DIPP)</ITAG>Algoma received DIPP grants for the installation of hot metal desulphurizationfacilities in 1980 and 1981. We examined these grants in OCTG. Consistentwith the ``Subsidies Appendix'', we divide the sum of all grants receivedin each year by the total sales of the company in the same year. Algomareceived no other grants in 1980 and 1981. The calculated benefits in OCTGwere <T3>de minimis, i.e., </T3>less than 0.50 percent. Therefore, as in OCTG,we expensed them in the year of receipt. Because the DIPP grants receivedby Algoma were expensed prior to the review period and because no DIPPgrants were received by Algoma during the review period, we determine thatAlgoma did not use this program.<ITAG tagnum="81">2.

Income Tax Exemption for Sysco</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">Comments</ITAG>All written comments submitted by the interested parties in this investigationwhich have not previously been addressed in this notice are addressed below.<T3>Comment 1: </T3>Sysco argues that the short-term interest rate benchmarkshould be the interest rate on BAs and commercial paper, which representthe normal type of short-term financing for large companies. Furthermore,Sysco quotes from the Proposed Regulations that a short-term benchmarkshould be based on an average of the predominant interest rate.Petitioner contends that the short-term benchmark should be based on thepredominant form of short-term financing and the highest short-term rateobservable on that form of financing, which would be prime plus three percent.Petitioner maintains that corporate paper and BAs do not constitute thepredominant forms of financing because, together, they only account for20 percent of short-term financing in Canada. Petitioner also argues thatthere is no justification for a benchmark based on BAs and corporate paperbecause Sysco does not have the assets of a ``large'' company as definedby the GOC.DOC PositionAccording to past practice, the short-term benchmark is based on the averageinterest rate on the predominant form of short-term financing. (See RedrawRod.) Absent information on a single predominant form of short-term financing,we use as the short-term benchmark the weighted-average of the interestrates from two or more sources of short-term financing that together accountfor at least 50 percent of all short-term financing. We verified that BAsand corporate paper together account for only 20 percent of short-termfinancing in Canada. Average interest rate information on the remaining80 percent of short-term financing is not available. Therefore, we choseas the best information available, for purposes of this investigation,the rate charged Algoma on its short-term financing.<T3>Comment 2: </T3>Sysco contends that its five-year trust company loansshould be considered short-term loans. Sysco's argument is based on thefact that each of the trust companies has the option to demand paymentin full of the outstanding principal and interest with 30 days notice.In addition, as is characteristic of short-term loans, these five-yearloans have variable interest rates.Petitioner holds that Sysco's trust company loans should be consideredlong-term loans because on their face the loans have a term of five years.Furthermore, petitioner argues that Sysco has not demonstrated that thedemand option has ever been used or that Sysco has ever prepaid any ofthese loans. Moreover, petitioner points out that Sysco rolled over severalof these loans past their original terms.<T3>DOC Position: </T3>We have determined that Sysco's five-year trustcompany loans should be treated as long-term loans because: (1) They arerecorded as long-term loans in the audited financial statements of thecompany, (2) payment has never been demanded or made before maturity, (3)several of the loans have been rolled-over past their original term, and(4) Sysco has a grossly insufficient amount of liquid assets which couldbe used to pay these loans if they were demanded before maturity. Thislast point indicates that Sysco does not anticipate these loans being paidbefore maturity.<T3>Comment 3: </T3>Sysco argues that its five-year trust company loansshould be considered short-term loans because for all long-term loan benefits,and other benefits allocated over time, a ``grant equivalent'' can be calculatedand that for a long-term loan with a variable interest rate a grant equivalentcannot be calculated because the total amount of any countervailable benefitis contingent upon future benchmarks. Therefore, according to Sysco, wemust treat Sysco's five-year trust company loans as short-term.<T3>DOC Position: </T3>It is true that a grant equivalent cannot be calculatedfor a variable rate loan. However, simply because a grant equivalent cannotbe calculated does not prevent the Department from treating the loans inquestion as long-term for other purposes.<T3>Comment 4: </T3>Petitioner argues that the benchmark for the long-termvariable interest rate loans guaranteed by the GONS should be eight percentover prime, plus a risk premium.Sysco argues that petitioner's suggested benchmark should not be used becauseit was a ``guesstimate'' by a Canadian banking official. Sysco also pointsout that the Department in Groundfish stated that there was ``no comparablelong-term variable or fixed interest rate commonly available to Canadianfirms'' and that, as a result, ``a short-term benchmark interest rate wasused to calculate the benefit from long-term variable rate loans.''<T3>DOC Position: </T3>We have explained our choice of a benchmark forSysco's long-term variable rate loans in Section I.C.3. Petitioner's suggestedbenchmark is based on a statement made by a Canadian banking official,which we have determined to be too speculative for use. With respect toSysco's comment, regarding Groundfish, in this investigation we were ableto obtain information on a comparable long-term fixed interest rate; therefore,we did not use a short-term benchmark.<T3>Comment 5: </T3>Sysco argues that if the debenture guarantees are consideredcountervailable, the benefit is equal to an annual fee of one percent whichis charged under other government loan guarantee programs.<T3>DOC Position: </T3>We have determined that the most appropriate methodof measuring the benefit from a government loan guarantee is to comparethe terms of the guaranteed financing to the benchmark financing. (Seethe ``Analysis of Programs'' section.)<T3>Comment 6: </T3>Sysco argues that a ``put'' option on its debentureeffectively lowered the risk on the debenture issue and, therefore, loweredthe interest rate. Respondent refers to the ``Final Affirmative AntidumpingDetermination: Generic Cephalexin Capsules from Canada'' (Cephalexin),54 FR 26,820, June 26, 1989, in which the Department made the followingstatement regarding the treatment of a stock convertibility option: ``thisoption represents a real * * * cost to respondent over and above the costof the interest payments to the debenture holders.'' Sysco also submittedwith its case brief two debenture prospectuses, one with a ``put'' optionand the other without, and calculated the value of the option at 1.375percent.Petitioner first points out that Sysco never provided information concerningthe ``put'' option in its questionnaire responses. Petitioner further arguesthat Sysco has not adequately stated how the two debenture prospectusessubmitted are comparable to Sysco's debentures. Moreover, petitioner statesthat Sysco mischaracterizes its option as one of convertibility ratherthan redemption and that Sysco omitted a key portion of the quote fromCephalexin, which reads in full ``[t]his represents a real, though unquantifiablecost to respondent over and above the cost of the interest payments tothe debenture holders.''<T3>DOC Position: </T3>This issue was not raised in any of the questionnaireresponses of Sysco. It was first raised during verification. Thus, thisinformation was submitted too late for the Department to analyze priorto verification and for the petitioner to meaningfully comment upon. (SeeandSection; 353.31(a) of the Department's regulations published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on December 27, 1988 (53 FR 52306) (to be codifiedat 19 CFR 353.31(a).)<T3>Comment 7: </T3>Sysco argues that, because the interest rates on itsdebentures are at market rates, an appropriate benchmark for the U.S. dollardenominated debenture would be rates on comparable debentures issued in1973. Respondents submitted prospectuses for two debenture issues for useas possible benchmarks.Petitioner refutes respondent's suggested benchmarks by stating that theydo not represent a national average, do not follow the hierarchy of benchmarksfor long-term loans outlined in the Proposed Regulations and do not includethe risk premium calculated for an uncreditworthy company.<T3>DOC Position: </T3>According to our standard practice, our benchmarkin the case of long-term fixed rate financing provided to an uncreditworthycompany is the highest long-term fixed interest rate commercially availableto a marginally creditworthy company plus the risk premium. (See the ``SubsidiesAppendix'' and the ``Analysis of Programs'' section.) We are using therate on U.S. Baa corporate bonds as the highest long-term fixed interestrate.<T3>Comment 8: </T3>Respondent contends that for the final determinationthe effective interest rate on the Series C debenture should take intoaccount exchange rate fluctuations between the Canadian and U.S. dollars.Respondent argues that the fluctuations between the Canadian and U.S. dollarshave increased the effective interest rate to Sysco of its Series C financing.Petitioner argues that the Department's use of effective interest ratesis to ensure that, when a potentially preferential interest rate is comparedto a benchmark, both rates reflect the full cost of the loan to the borrower.Petitioner then lists other aspects of a loan, such as the prepayment ofinterest, which can change the actual cost to the borrower. Petitionerconcludes by stating that the declining value of the Canadian dollar isirrelevant and that the only question is whether the debenture guaranteepermitted Sysco to pay an interest rate lower than it would have otherwise.<T3>DOC Position: </T3>The benefit from the debenture guarantee is onethat arises from issuing the debenture on terms that were more favorablethan those commercially available. The currency in which the company choosesto issue the debenture is immaterial; this represents a risk chosen bythe company which is irrelevant to the terms and conditions of the issue.<T3>Comment 9: </T3>Sysco states that the Department erred in applyingthe specificity test to the individual subsidiary agreements and not tothe general agreements under the GDA and ERDA programs. Because GDA andERDA agreements cover all areas of Canada, these programs do not meet thespecificity test and, as such, are not countervailable. Finally, Syscoargues that any government assistance program if broken down into sufficientlysmall subparts can be found to meet the specificity test.Petitioner argues that GDA and ERDA benefits are specific and, thus, arecountervailable. Monies provided to Sysco were at the discretion of thegovernments and were provided to Sysco specifically. Lastly, petitionerstates that under Sysco's analysis, governments could avoid the impositionof countervailing duties by lumping all of their subidy programs into asingle overall program.DOC Position: We have found in our past cases that GDAs and ERDAs do notactually establish any government programs but instead ar merely legalagreements which, dual or conflicting jurisdictions, provide a frameworkto permit departments of the federal and provincial governments to cooperatein establishing and administering traditional government assistance programs.The implementation, administration and funding of industry- and regional-specificprograms occur exclusively through subsidiary agreements. Therefore, wehave decided that in determining whether subsidiary agreement programsare limited to a specific enterprise or industry or group thereof, theproper level of analysis is the subsidiary agreement. (<T3>See also </T3>Groundfish and ``Final Negative Countervailing Duty Determination:Certain Softwood Products from Canada,'' 48 FR 24,159, May 31, 1983.)<T3>Comment 10:</T3> Petitioner states that the basic seven percent taxcredit should be countervailed since it is provided only to specific investments,<T3>i.e., </T3>to ``qualified property.'' Petitioner also states that theDepartment erred in relying on past Department cases on this issue andnot verifying the program in this investigation. Petitioner states thatan amendment to the Act made by the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Actof 1988 now requires the Department to investigate whether a program isin fact provided to specific industries or groups of industries.<T3>DOC Position: </T3>The 1988 Act provision referred to clarified thatin all cases the Department must examine the availability and use of allegedsubsidy programs on a <T3>de facto</T3> as well as a <T3>de jure </T3>basis. Our prior investigations of the basic seven percenttax credit have satisfied us that this credit is not limited to a specificenterprise or industry or group thereof on either a <T3>de facto</T3> or <T3>de jure </T3>basis. Because the seven percent tax credit ws previouslyfound not countervailable, and petitioner did not provide the Departmentwith a sufficient basis to reexamine it, we did not include the programin this investigation. (<T3>See </T3>OCTG and Groundfish.)<T3>Comment 11: </T3>Sysco states that the Department erroneously treatedgrants for repayment of principal on its debentures as equity infusions.Petitioner states that the Department should countervail the equity infusionsmade by GONS and use the grant methodology as it did in the preliminarydetermination.DOC Position: As noted in the ``Analysis of Programs'' section and sectionI.C.4., the Department was not able to use its standard method of calculatingthe benefit from an equity infusion but had to treat all equity infusionsas grants. As such, this issue is moot.<T3>Comment 12: </T3>Petitioner states that in analyzing the freight rateissue the Department should not consider Algoma's ability to transportiron ore by truck or buy iron ore from other sources. Petitioner arguesthat the proper test is whether the freight service was provided at a preferentialrate. In support of its position, petitioner cites the ``Final NegativeCountervailing Duty Determination: Granite from Italy'' (Granite), 43 FR27,197, July 19, 1988. Petitioner states that the reductions in freightrates was a direct result of government action so that it constituted theprovision of a service on preferential terms, within the meaning of thestatue.Algoma argues that the grants to ACR did not benefit Algoma because (1)the ACR freight rates were the result of arm's length negotiations andwere not set by government intervention, (2) the ACR tour grants were tiedto ACR's tour operations, and (3) even if the tour grants resulted in lowerfreight rate to Algoma, they have provided no commerical benefits to thecompany and have had an insignificant impact on its cost of production.<T3>DOC Position: </T3>We verified that the lowering of Algoma's freightrates was part of a four party arrangement, which included the federaland provincial governments, ACR and Algoma, the result of which was thereduction in the freight rate paid by Algoma. Therefore, we have determinedthat the provision of grants to ACR provided an indirect subsidy to Algomain the form of reduced freight rates.We calculated the benefit by comparing the difference between the loweredfreight rates and the available trucking rates. This case is distinguishablefrom Granite because unlike Granite it does not involve a government-ownedrailway. Therefore, the issue is not the preferential provision of a goodor service by a government.<T3>Comment 13: </T3>Petitioner states that the Department erred in notinitiating an investigation on the alleged special tax subsidy to Algoma.Petitioner alleges that Algoma has accumulated ITCs which it was unableto use because it was in a loss position. In an attempt to utilize thesecredits and complete construction of a seamless tube mill, Algoma formeda partnership with its parent, the Canadian Pacific Railroad (CP). Accordingto petitioner, CP was able to reduce its tax liability by using the accruedITCs of Algoma, which had been transferred to the partnership. Later, Algomapurchased CP's partnership units, thereby dissolving the partnership.Algoma argues that petitioner did not allege in a timely manner facts sufficientto establish a prima facie case that warranted an investigation and that,even if petitioner did make a timely allegation, the ITCs are tied to theproduction of seamless tube mill and, thus, do not provide any benefitto Algoma's steel rail production.DOC Position: Our position concerning the alleged special tax subsidy hasnot changed since the beginning of this investigation. As we have statedpreviously in two memoranda to the file, we did not include this programin the investigation because the alleged benefit received by Algoma istied to a product not under investigation. All the information submittedby petitioner clearly indicates that the specific purpose of the Algoma/CPpartnership, and the attendant tax and financial transactions, was to completethe construction of a seamless tube mill. Thus, any benefit is tied toa product other than the merchandise under investigation. Nothing in theinformation submitted by petitioner indicates that any of the alleged benefitscan be tied to the production of the subject merchandise. Therefore, wedid not include the alleged special tax subsidy in the investigation.<T3>Comment 14: </T3>Sysco maintains that the treatment of the wharf loanshould be the same as at the preliminary determination. Sysco argues thatonly the principal amount of $7,734,483, uncollectible as of June 1978and forgiven in 1981, should be considered a grant and allocated over 20years.<T3>DOC Position: </T3>The wharf was completed in June 1978, and Syscowas to make payments beginning in June 1979. Sysco made no payments onthe principal and interest outstanding. The total outstanding was effectivelyan interest-free loan for the period 1979 through 1981. Therefore, we haveadded to the total original balance of $7,734,483, the interest that wouldhave been paid on the principal outstanding at the benchmark rate and treatedthis total amount as a grant given in 1981.<T3>Comment 15: </T3>The GOC raises the issue of whether HTS item number8548.00.0000 is properly included within the scope of this investigation.<T3>DOC Position: </T3>The HTS item number referred to by the GOC includescontact rail or ``third rail'' and, therefore, is properly included withinthe scope.<ITAG tagnum="84">Verification</ITAG>In accordance with section 776(b) of the Act, we verified the informationused in making our final determination. As mentioned previously, when wecould not verify the information, we used the best information available.During verification, we followed standard verification procedures, includingmeeting with government and company officials; inspecting internal documentsand ledgers; tracing information in the responses to source documents,accounting ledgers and financial statements; and collecting additionalinformation that we deemed necessary for making our final determination.<ITAG tagnum="84">Suspension of Liquidation</ITAG>In accordance with our preliminary affirmative countervailing duty determinationpublished on March 2, 1989, we directed the U.S. Customs Service to suspendliquidation on the products under investigation and to require that a cashdeposit or bond be posted equal to the estimated bonding rate. The instantfinal countervailing duty determination was extended to coincide with thefinal antidumping duty determination on the same product from Canada, pursuantto section 606 of the Trade and Tariff Act of 1984 (section 705(a)(1) ofthe Act).Under Article 5, paragraph 3 of the Subsidies Code, provisional measurescannot be imposed for more than 120 days without final affirmative determinationsof subsidization and injury. Therefore, we instructed the U.S. CustomsService to discontinue the suspension of liquidation on the subject merchandiseentered on or after July 1, 1989, but to continue the suspension of liquidationof all entries, or withdrawals from warehouse, for consumption of the subjectmerchandise entered between March 2, 1989, and June 30, 1989. We will reinstatesuspension of liquidation under section 703(d) of the Act, if the ITC issuesa final affirmative injury determination, and will require a cash depositon all entries of the subject merchandise from producer exporters, exceptentries by Algoma, in an amount equal to 113.56 percent <T3>ad valorem</T3>.
