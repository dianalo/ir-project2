Administration officials saluted the report as furtherproof that strong exports are pulling the country out ofrecession.   But manufacturers aren't so sure. Daniel J. Meyer,president of machine-tool maker Cincinnati Milacron Inc.,recently noted, as has nearly every executive with overseasbusiness, &quot;a softening in Europe.&quot; Germany's economy isstruggling with its unification process, while France and theUnited Kingdom are mired in recession. Then there's the DarthVader of exports: the stronger dollar, which makes U.S. goodsmore expensive for foreign buyers. If U.S. manufacturersdon't cut prices, they could lose market share to thelower-priced goods of overseas competitors. If they do slashprices, they lose profits.   Because of the strong dollar, it makes little sense for A.Schulman Inc. of Akron, Ohio, to export its plastic compoundsfrom Texas to Europe. Instead, the company is relying onEuropean manufacturing operations to supply that part of theworld. &quot;We haven't had the export opportunities we hadearlier due to the dollar situation,&quot; says President TerryHaines.   WEFA Group, an economics forecasting concern based in BalaCynwyd, Pa., expects the dollar to remain strong through thefourth quarter. Thomas Runiewicz, a senior economist at WEFA,notes that as industrial manufacturers scale back prices toremain internationally competitive, export prices of capitalgoods will fall 3.3% in 1991.   No one expects manufacturing exports to vanish. Companiesmaking car parts and plastic have made tremendousinternational inroads during the era of a cheap dollar andstrong foreign demand. Durable-goods exports, mesasured inbillions of dollars, have increased 88% from 1986 to 1990.And while the trade deficit widened marginally in April,exports were up 4.5% from the previous month to a record$35.56 billion. Manufacturers are loath to surrender thosegains. Moreover, exports enable companies to keep productionlevels high and operations more efficient, while avoiding thecosts of laying off workers and idle operations.   While the volume and number of products being exportedwill expand, high growth rates likely won't continue forindustrial manufacturers in the current climate. For example,exports by U.S. steelmakers have doubled since 1988 andsurged 36% in the first four months of 1991 from the yearago, but in recent weeks some steelmakers have begun toretrench.   &quot;Steel companies are beginning to pull out of the exportmarket,&quot; says Peter Marcus of PaineWebber. It's no wonder.Export prices have already fallen about 10% in recent months.Now, says Mr. Marcus, ubiquitous hot-rolled sheet steelfetches $245 a ton on the export market, even though averagepretax costs are about $300 a ton.   Moreover, steelmakers are finding the usually receptiveAsian market saturated: Japanese steel buyers are beginningto have excess inventories and the construction boom thereseems to be slowing.   Plastic and pulp makers aren't faring much better. Pricesfor plastic resins have fallen 30% to 35% since the beginningof the year, while list prices for pulp exports plummetedabout 28% in recent months.   &quot;There's simply too much production,&quot; says Russell Fulton,who directs pulp operations for Northwood Forest IndustriesLtd., a 50-50 joint venture between Mead Corp. and NorandaForest Inc. The U.S., Canada, Brazil and the Scandinaviancountries have continued to add pulp capacity even thoughdemand for paper is sinking along with advertising linage.   Northwood, based in Prince George, British Columbia,hasn't been driven from any markets by bare-bones pricing.But Mr. Fulton says, &quot;Whether or not we opt to get into amarket is now price-related.&quot; Other pulp makers are likewiseexpected to be more selective, resulting in fewer exports.Pulp exports are expected to grow by only 2% in 1991,compared with almost 5% in 90.   Snap-On Tools Corp., Kenosha, Wis., has already shiftedemphasis from its larger but weaker export markets -- Canadaand the United Kingdom -- to smaller, less mature markets,including Belgium and the Netherlands. While overseas salesof its automotive-related hand tools will be profitable,export profits won't be at their traditional level of 11% ofsales, the company said.   Nor is export growth expected to continue at double-digitlevels. &quot;We didn't anticipate a lengthy recession anywhere,&quot;says spokesman David Heide, adding that non-U.S. salesfigures are being revised downward. Analysts expect thecompany's exports to grow only about 7% in 1991, down from17% in 1990.   As world markets ease, foreign companies are turning tothe less-lethargic U.S., threatening domestic trade gains.Telltale signs are already emerging: According to a recentsurvey by the Steel Service Center Institute, whichrepresents steel buyers, 15% of the institute's members saidforeign mills were more actively seeking U.S. business, upfrom 10% in April. Steel imports rose 27.6% in April fromMarch.   WEFA Group expects net exports to be barely positive in1991, and turn negative in 1992, when exports expand by 3.6%and imports grow 5.3%   Some export areas remain strong. For example, whileprofits for Mead's pulp export business are down, business isbooming both in the U.S. and overseas for its coated boardproducts used in packaging wet and frozen foods. Food-relatedproducts are more recession-proof than durable goods.   And even in the depressed steel industry, there are someexceptions. Pittsburgh-based Allegheny Ludlum Corp. managesto maintain strong prices and profits for itscorrosion-resistant stainless steel used for offshore oilplatforms.   Still, profit margins are less attractive on exports thandomestic sales. John Tumazos, an analyst with DonaldsonLufkin andamp; Jenrette, says while Allegheny Ludlum shipped 2%more steel in the first quarter than in the year-ago periodthanks to exports, revenues per ton fell 6% reflecting inpart more-competitive export prices.   &quot;With the dollar, it's going to be a greater challenge tomaintain the export business,&quot; the company says. &quot;But youcan't go in and out of a market. We've worked very hard toincrease our export business and intend to stay there.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
