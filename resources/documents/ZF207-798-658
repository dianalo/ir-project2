X-MP/48supercomputer and on a Control Data Corp. Cyber 855, which serves as a frontend to the Cray machine.andP;  In order to develop the model, the center workedclosely with Cray technicians.andP;  In fact, the ECMWF, which began talking toCray in 1977, was the supercomputer vendor's third customer.andP;  Bengtssonbelieves that it was this close relationship with Cray that made the center'sprogress in computer modeling possible.andP;  &quot;Discussion with manufacturers at anearly stage is crucial [in such major modeling projects],&quot; says Bengtsson,adding that &quot;there is no official meteorological users group yet, but thereis a great need for one.&quot;andM;While the approach taken by model builders and computer manufacturers hasbeen reasonably successful so far, a much more comprehensive strategy will beneeded to tackle the enormous task of monitoring and predicting the long-termeffects of various substances on the ozone layer.andP;  The ECMWF itself isworking on creating a model that will project the long-term consequences ofongoing environmental changes.andM;ECMWF's West German partners in this effort are the Max Planck Institute andthe Deutsche Klimarechenzentrum, a national climate research center also inHamburg.andP;  The focus at the Klimarechenzentrum, which runs simulation modelsoff its Cray 2 supercomputer, is on the long-term effects of carbon monoxideon the earth's atmosphere.andM;To determine those long-term effects with a better degree of certainty,researchers need better models and machines.andP;  That opinion is voiced by ErnstMaier-Reimer, a senior scientist at the Max Planck Institute, who says that&quot;the ability to simulate what the earth's climate and atmosphere will be 20years from now is still not far enough in the future.andP;  We should be able tosimulate at least 50 years ahead.&quot;andM;To put more computational muscle into the machines, West Germany, under theauspices of its Research Ministry, is working on a high-capacitysupercomputer with parallel processing capabilities called the Suprenum.andP;  Thecomputer, which is being designed primarily for experiments in fluiddynamics, will also assist scientists in climate research related to ozonelayer damage and the greenhouse effect.andM;Super SolutionsandM;Guenther Marx, head of information processing at the West German ResearchMinistry says that Suprenum's 5 billion floating point operations per second(GFLOPS) capacity will help &quot;mankind gain time and perhaps eliminate the[environmental] dangers.andP;  Without supercomputers, we can't hope forsolutions,&quot; he says.andM;Outside the governmental research realm, private industry in Germany is alsokeenly interested in applying IS technology to help monitor, simulate and, insome cases, repair damage that has already been done to the environment.andO;West Germany, hit hard over the last five years by one environmentalcatastrophe after another, is particularly aware of the importance of suchtechnology applications.andM;West German interest in computer models has created a market demand forhardware and software associated with those models--a demand expected toaccelerate at a rate of over 40% per year, according to Gerhard Adler, ananalyst with Diebold Germany in Frankfurt.andP;  That demand could become evengreater if certain forecasts come true.andP;  Economists at Frankfurt'sCommerzbank, for example, are predicting that the whole area of environmentalprotection could evolve into one of the world's fastest growing industries.andM;In West Germany, companies such as Bayer AG are helping that industrydevelop.andP;  The giant pharmaceuticals firm, headquartered in Leverkusen, spentDM1.9 billion ($1.05 billion) on what it calls &quot;environmentally friendly&quot;measures--that's six times its total expenditures in 1970.andP;  Bayer usessupercomputers from every major manufacturer to maintain a chemicals databaseenabling the company to examine the toxic and ecological impact of everyproduct it's ever produced.andM;&quot;Our goal,&quot; explains Mathias Willig, an engineer and environmental researcherat Bayer, &quot;Is to have by the mid-1990s, a complete overview--to know thecontent of all our products and whether we should continue them or take themoff the market if environmental safety guidelines dictate that.&quot;andM;Bayer is also using computers to help undo some of the more general damagedone to the environment in the past.andP;  &quot;We use computers to examine theenvironment and think out strategies.andP;  We want to be able to notice suddentchanges and react quickly,&quot; says Willig.andM;Wolfhart Gilessen is a mathematician and researcher at theIndustrieanlagen-Betriebsgesellschaft (IABG), a quasi-governmentalorganization in Otobrunn near Munich that does research for both the privateand public sectors.andP;  He reports that his department's objective is to createa central database of environmental information.andP;  It's the data for themodels that Gilessen says is the important thing.andP;  &quot;Germans are hard workersand good model builders, but the model is separated too much from the data.&quot;andM;Assessing the DamageandM;Siegfried Schildmacher, head of the city of Hannover's Office ofEnvironmental Protection and Urban Development, recommends that technology befocused away from systems that merely monitor and mend the environment andtoward proactive systems that recognize damage early on so that strategiescan be developed to limit that damage.andP;  &quot;It's a future-oriented field,&quot;declares Schildmacher.andP;  &quot;The fact that we can measure minute changes in theenvironment [means that we] can bring immediate improvement in theenvironment.andP;  And it's certainly easier to bring about improvement when youknow more about the damage done.&quot;andM;This argument in favor of automation is not enough for Greens' environmentalcoordinator Wolfgang Helms.andP;  Helms says that although the Greens favor theexpanded role of computers in the war against environmental problems, theparty does not believe that technology is at the heart of the solution.andP;  &quot;Weare very skeptical about relying on computers for all the answers.andP;  They giveus more data about our dying forests and rivers.andP;  But then we end up with aflood of data and still no political solutions,&quot; he says.andM;Today in West Germany, the environmental issue is a political hot potato.andP;  Infact, a major debate is now raging over whether to incorporate &quot;the right toa clean and healthy environment&quot; in the country's constitution.andP;  If thathappens, officials at the West German Ministry of Environment predict thatcomputers could play a key role in keeping that pledge--a pledge that,ironically, could fuel the development of a new industry literally from theashes of old industries.andM;Peggy Trautman is a technology journalist based in Bonn.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
