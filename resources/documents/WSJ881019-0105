The Nasdaq composite index gained 1.24 to close at 386.25. Trading volume reached its highest level in seven sessions, with 132.3 million shares changing hands. Analysts said they expect the OTC market to snap out of the doldrums it has been in for the past two months once third-quarter earnings have been reported.    &quot;By the end of October, many companies will have already reported earnings, and we could start to get a little better action from these stocks,&quot; said George Constantine, a senior analyst at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets.    He said medium-sized companies -- those valued at $50 million to $500 million -- have performed poorly in the past two months but have the potential to &quot;move in line with the big averages and could outperform them for a short time.&quot;    Meanwhile, earnings reports are moving stocks both higher and lower. MCI Communications gained 1 1/8 to 22 1/8 on volume of almost six million shares. The company reported sharply higher third-quarter earnings. Another factor was a federal judge's order late last week aimed at the seven regional Bell companies that could benefit MCI and other long-distance telephone competitors.    Among stocks with bad earnings news was La Petite Academy, which fell 2 1/4 to 9 after reporting a third-quarter loss of $349,000. The day-care center operator had a year-earlier profit of $2 million, or 13 cents a share.    Software Services of America slid 1 3/4 to 11 amid apprehension over the company's earnings for its fiscal year ended in May, Dow Jones Professional Investor Report said. The problem was that there was no news; the earnings report had been expected to be released yesterday but wasn't.    For Vipont Pharmaceutical, the good news wasn't good enough. It fell 1 1/8 to 14 1/8 in spite of two seemingly bullish announcements.    The Fort Collins, Colo., company said it expects fourth-quarter earnings to be about 22% higher than last year's. Vipont also said it signed an agreement under which Colgate-Palmolive will make and sell products overseas based on Vipont's patented anti-plaque technology. But traders said some investors had expected the earnings to be still better, and others saw both pieces of news as an opportunity to take profits.    In its first day of trading, Metcalf andamp; Eddy rose 2 1/4 from its initial offering price to 16 3/4 after trading as high as 18. Volume was a brisk one million shares.    Traders and analysts said the Branchburg, N.J., concern's stock was received well because it's in a popular industry. Metcalf andamp; Eddy provides environmental treatment services to government and business clients.    &quot;The response to the Metcalf offering is an affirmation that the environmental services stocks have gotten too cheap,&quot; said Jack Sullivan, a principal at Van Kasper andamp; Co. a San Francisco brokerage firm specializing in new and over-the-counter issues. Like many other investors and traders, Mr. Sullivan says stocks in the group eventually will &quot;grow faster than the market and sell at a premium&quot; because government agencies and businesses will have to spend lots of money on cleanups of toxic materials in coming years.    &quot;These companies will be important as the country deals with its very real environmental problems,&quot; Mr. Sullivan said. &quot;The spending that will take place for cleanup is simply not optional, which will mean more business for these companies.&quot;    But such optimism about environmental spending can cause investors and analysts to be unforgiving when a company doesn't live up to expectations.    Finnigan is a clear example. The stock fell 2 7/8 to 16 5/8 even as it reported improved third-quarter earnings.    The market once had high hopes for the scientific instruments maker, which supplies spectrometers and gas chromatographs to the environmental services industry. But analysts and brokers have lost confidence, saying the San Jose, Calif., company hasn't coped well with increased competition and softened demand for its wares.    &quot;Finnigan is burdened with a high degree of skepticism because it hasn't been able to follow through on its early promise,&quot; says Van Kasper's Mr. Sullivan.    In an interview, Kurt Kruger, an analyst with Hambrecht andamp; Quist, said he lowered his earnings estimates for Finnigan and began recommending this summer that investors avoid the stock after learning that product orders had slowed and that its backlog is low.    T.Z. Chu, Finnigan's chairman and president, acknowledged that the lower backlog and orders have raised doubts about whether the company can continue to show earnings improvements. But he said the company has &quot;lived up to earnings expectations so far.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
