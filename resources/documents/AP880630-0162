The spokesman, Fred Hoffman, said he was unaware whether anydocuments involved in the Pentagon bribery probe had been destroyedin the Defense Department, but that the department was looking intosuch allegations.   People implicated in the investigation have destroyed documentson at least two occasions in the past two weeks, according toprosecutors who say making key information public would trigger acoverup by ``major felons.''   ``In the short time since the execution of the search warrantsbecame public (June 14), the government has already become aware ofseveral incidents of destruction of documents related to thiscase,'' U.S. Attorney Henry Hudson, who is coordinating the probe,said in a court brief released Wednesday.   In an affidavit, Assistant U.S. Attorney Joseph Aronica saidprosecutors have learned of two incidents of document destruction.   On Capitol Hill, members of Congress called on Defense SecretaryFrank C. Carlucci to make a ``dramatic move'' such as halting newPentagon contracts to win back public credibility in the wake ofthe bribery probe.   ``We're fighting a credibility problem here and it seems asthough tough action is required,'' said Rep. John Kasich, R-Ohio.   ``We would be glad to discuss with the Congress the question offreezing awards of new contracts while the Justice Department isinvestigating allegations of procurement fraud,'' said Hoffman.   ``But at this point we feel it would be imprudent to apply sucha freeze or moratorium,'' he told reporters at a briefing.   ``The innocent would suffer as well as the guilty. And such afreeze would be equivalent of debarment without due process. Youmay be sure that we will take precautions in any awards.''   ``Our contracts have adequate clauses which can be brought intoplay to repen them and take other action to protect the publicinterest,'' he said.   ``However, we wonder whether the members of Congress calling fora freeze or a moratorium have thought through the possibleconsequences, such as higher program costs, production lineshutdowns, widespread plant lay-offs and damage to the readiness ofour forces,'' he said.   Hudson, in his court brief, discussed the possibility of furtherdocument destruction in arguing against release of sealed courtdocuments.   ``Revealing the precise contours of the government's intentionsand current information may well encourage document destruction andother acts'' which ``would have the practical effect of puttingmajor felons beyond the reach of justice,'' said Hudson, the U.S.attorney in Alexandria, Va.   Newsday Inc. is asking U.S. District Judge Edward Korman inBrooklyn, N.Y., to lift the seal on several search warrants andsupporting affidavits in the probe: for Unisys Corp.'s plant inGreat Neck, N.Y.; Charles Gardner, a defense consultant to Unisysand former Unisys vice president; Dennis Mitchell, an employee atthe Great Neck Unisys plant; and the Hazeltine Corp. in Greenlawn.   Newsday said the seals should be lifted because theinvestigation has been extensively reported in the media, butHudson said previous news stories haven't disclosed significantportions of the material, ``particularly the wiretap information.''   Hudson also said disclosing the affidavit in support of a searchwarrant at Hazeltine would reveal the identity of a confidentialsource cooperating in the investigation.   Hudson did not provide any details on who destroyed what typesof documents, how they were destroyed or how they might have beenrelated to the probe of alleged bribes to Pentagon personnel inexchange for confidential information funneled to consultants anddefense contractors.   In Washington, the Pentagon's top purchasing official, Robert B.Costello, testified before Congress and said he would talk withCarlucci today about a suggestion to halt Pentagon contracts.   Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., said Carlucci should order ``absolutelyno contracts signed for 60 days (or) six weeks'' with companiesinvolved in the criminal investigation.   ``Carlucci could make a dramatic move,'' Aspin told Costello,the undersecretary of defense for acquisition policy.   ``We're going to write some tough language into these contractsso that we can recoup some of this stuff and make sure that allcontracts that are let, from here on out,'' are legal, said Aspin.   Aspin noted that contractors and weapons involved in theinvestigation include McDonnell-Douglas and the F-A-18, thetop-line Navy fighter. After the two-year investigation becamepublic, the Pentagon went ahead with contract awards for the plane,Aspin said.   On June 23, the Pentagon announced it was grantingMcDonnell-Douglas a $960 million contract for F-A-18 work, Aspinnoted.   ``It's clear the Pentagon hasn't come up with any plan fordealing with contractors under a cloud,'' he said.   Costello, during a day-long meeting of the House Armed ServicesCommittee, repeatedly defended the Defense Department procurementpolicies of the Reagan administration.   Congress can enact new laws and the Pentagon can pass newregulations, but there is no way to ensure against cheating,Costello said.   Costello shied away from his May 5 proposal last month to giveDefense Department officials authority to prevent searches ofcontractors' facilities by fraud investigators. Costello said hewouldn't write the same memo he had written May 5.   Rep. J. Roy Rowland, D-Ga., told Costello his proposal ``is notappropriate. ... It doesn't look good; it doesn't smell good.''   Costello declined to agree it was inappropriate, but added thathe wouldn't write it now. ``I can change my mind,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
