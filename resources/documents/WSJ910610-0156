According to bankers familiar with the situation, IslandCreek of China Coal Ltd., a 50-50 joint venture betweenOccidental and China Trust andamp; Consultancy Co., notified itscreditors last week that it would retire its debt in fulllater this month. Island Creek, which controls 50% of themine, has drawn down about $200 million of a $475 millionsyndicated loan arranged in Hong Kong for the project.</LP><TEXT>   Prepayment of the debt would remove the last major hurdleto Occidental's exit from the $750 million coal mine, thelargest joint venture between China and a foreign company todate.   Foreign investors and bankers applaud the development ontwo scores. By facilitating Occidental's exit, they say,China will bolster the confidence of potential investors. Inaddition, they say that by settling the venture's debtspromptly, China has earned some credibility for honoring aloan commitment at a time when many foreign banks are havingdifficulties trying to persuade Beijing to takeresponsibility for problem debts.   &quot;China is telling the world that . . . it is capable ofrepaying its debt any time,&quot; said an official with a foreignbank involved in the syndicated loan. &quot;It also is sending thesignal that foreign investors are allowed to come in andleave as they want.&quot;   Forty-one banks participated in the loan arranged by BAAsia Ltd., the Hong Kong merchant-banking arm of BankAmericaCorp. Spokesmen for BA Asia and Occidental declined tocomment on either the loan or the proposed sale of the minestake.   About a month ago, China Trust andamp; Consultancy, a unit ofstate-owned Bank of China, agreed to buy Occidental's 25%stake in the mine and assume the U.S. company's obligationsin the syndicated loan. Under the plan, the Chinese concern'sstake in the mine would increase to 50%. The remaining 50%has all along been held by China National Coal DevelopmentCorp. and China International Trust andamp; Investment Corp. Termsof the sale haven't been disclosed.   The prepayment decision came after Island Creek failed toobtain unanimous approval from creditors, as required by theloan agreement, for the Bank of China unit to take overOccidental's obligations.   Currently, the mine isn't officially completed because ithas yet to meet certain production requirements stipulated inthe loan agreement. Under that accord, the loan was to bejointly guaranteed by Occidental and the Bank of China unituntil the mine's official completion. Once the mine met itsproduction targets, only $100 million of the loan would havebeen guaranteed, meaning that the mine would rely mainly oncash flow from coal sales to meet debt repayments.   Occidental encountered initial opposition from Beijing toits desire to sell its mine stake. Chinese officialssubsequently relented, although it isn't clear whether thatwas because Occidental offered attractive terms or Beijingfeared how it would look to potential investors.</TEXT></DOC>
