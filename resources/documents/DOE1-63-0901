The results are for a specific harvesting systemand for procurement of forest biomass during summer-fall conditions.Based on the information generated from the initial forest biomass harvestingand burning experience, harvesting and burning of hardwood chips is betterthan a break-even operation at Bowater Newfoundland. The operation iscapable of profitably replacing oil; as oil prices increase, the profitmargin should increase. Mixing hardwood chips with bark increases theoverall boiler efficiency and steam production. The cost of harvestingbiomass over the three and one half month trial was $38.17 per greenton. This cost includes start-up costs and high chipper rental. At presentcapacity levels, cost could be reduced to $26-$28 per green ton if thechipper was charged off on a depreciated basis and start-up costs areexcluded. Production from the system can be increased and costs reducedfurther by the addition of two more skidders and two trucks. However,both of those changes require large capital expenditures to handle theincreased tonnage of chips that cannot be justified at present. Oil priceswould have to increase significantly and more experience is necessaryin biomass harvesting before such expenditures can be considered. Theonly negative aspect of the trials to date is an increase in air pollution.The forest management benefits of biomass harvesting appear to be positivebut no value has as yet been assessed. 18 figs., 19 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
