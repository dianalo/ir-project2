Some leading Democrats lean toward cooperation with theadministration _ perhaps culminating in full-fledged, high-levelnegotiations _ as the best way to forge a spending plan and to cutthe deficit to $100 billion, as required under the Gramm-Rudmanbalanced budget law.   House Budget Committee Chairman Leon Panetta, D-Calif., andSenate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, are among thoseadvocating a cooperative approach.   ``My sense is that as long as the administration wants to discussissues and look at options together, we're prepared to do that,''Panetta said in an interview.   Others, including House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, are lessdisposed to collaborate beyond the consultations already under wayamong White House and congressional budget writers, at least for now.   Some of these lawmakers argue that Democrats can gain politicallyby continuing to attack Bush's budget, and say there is no hurry towork out a bargain on the spending plan just yet.   ``It's the administration that feels an urgency to get thingsgoing,'' says Senate Budget Committee Chairman Jim Sasser, D-Tenn.   Others, including many liberals, are even more militant, arguingthat domestic programs would fare better if theDemocratic-controlled Congress wrote its own budget. An agreementwith the administration risks having Democrats share blame with Bushfor harsh cuts in popular programs, these legislators say.   ``The Bush budget has the rhetoric of a kinder, gentler America,but it has the fiscal numbers of an austere, harsh America,'' saysRep. William H. Gray III, a member of the House Democraticleadership and the former chairman of the House budget panel. ``TheDemocrats have to come up with their own budget.''   When Bush presented his spending proposal to theDemocratic-controlled Congress on Feb. 9, he simultaneously askedthe lawmakers to negotiate with him over its final shape.   Congressional Democrats complain that the president's blueprintis woefully lacking in details, especially on the cuts that would beneeded to meet overall spending limits envisioned in the plan. Theysay that before they agree to work out a budget jointly with Bush,they need specific figures indicating exactly how much theadministration proposes spending on the hundreds of separateprograms covered by the budget.   Some observers, however, believe Bush has won the first round ofthe public relations war.   ``Do you really think Joe Sixpack thinks it's unreasonable forthe president to say he wants to sit down with Congress and work itout?'' asked Carol Cox, president of the bipartisan Committee for aResponsible Federal Budget, which monitors budget activity.   ``At the moment, we're boxed in,'' says Rep. Richard Durbin,D-Ill., a budget committee member. ``The American people are lookingat Congress to make a move.''   Says Rep. Bill Frenzel of Minnesota, ranking GOP member on theHouse budget panel, ``It's been a pleasure to watch them writhe thisweek.''   Some Democrats say accusing Bush of producing a budget thatleaves about $10 billion worth of cuts for later bargaining _ andthat makes only tiny increases in priority domestic areas _ willeventually pay off with the public.   Gray and some other liberals say that rather than enacting Bush'splan, they prefer writing a Democratic budget that gets half of itssavings from domestic spending and half from defense.   That is the same formula under which the Gramm-Rudman lawautomatically slashes spending if the deficit target is missed, andthey argue that domestic spending would fare better this way.   Some Democrats fear that even if they negotiate a budgetsettlement with Bush, Republicans will campaign against them in thenext elections by blaming them for the cuts anyway.   If there are negotiations between the administration andCongress, a two-year budget _ rather than the usual one-year plan _could well emerge. This would get messy decisions for fiscal 1991out of the way before next year's campaigns, and free lawmakers toconcentrate on policy issues instead of spending woes.</TEXT></DOC>
