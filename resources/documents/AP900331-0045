(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   State troopers and corrections officerstoday blockaded entrances to the Ganienkeh Mohawk Territory aftergunfire they suspect came from the encampment struck a doctoraboard a military helicopter on a medical flight.   The doctor was hospitalized in good condition.   A Ganienkeh spokesman today denied Friday's shooting originatedfrom the settlement. State and federal authorities were meetingwith Mohawk representatives this morning to discuss the incident,Trooper Richard Garcia said.   The Mohawk tribe doesn't recognize federal or state jurisdictionon the land.   Busloads of people travel to the territory, about 150 milesnorth of Albany, every Friday evening to play high-stakes bingo,but the games were canceled Friday night.   After Mohawks refused to let troopers enter the land toinvestigate the shooting, at least 20 troopers and an undeterminednumber of corrections officers blockaded the four roads leading tothe territory, Garcia said.   ``We've turned back everybody,'' said Trooper Fred Curns, whowas at the scene. ``We'll turn back everybody until the powers thatbe decide it's safe to let them through.''   The Vermont Army National Guard helicopter was hit by threebullets fired from a rifle as it flew about 200 feet above theIndian territory, Garcia said. The settlement, which police say ishome to about 40 people, is on 700 acres of state-owned parkland inthe town of Altona.   The aircraft, carrying three military personnel and twocivilians, was on a medical flight from Burlington, Vt., toMassena, N.Y., to pick up a patient, said Lt. Lloyd Goodrow, AirNational Guard spokesman.   Dr. James Van Kirk of South Burlington, Vt., was struck in theright arm, Garcia said. Van Kirk, 27, the chief resident at MedicalCenter Hospital, was listed in good condition early today at theBurlington hospital.   Two of the bullets penetrated the fuselage and one hit the tailrotor, authorities said. The helicopter landed safely in a field inthe Mohawk territory.   ``We believe the shot came off the territory,'' Garcia said.``We can't determine who fired it without interviewing anyone. Theywon't let us interview anyone.''   Daryl Martin, a spokesman for the Ganienkeh, denied the shotsoriginated from the settlement.   ``There is no reason for us to provoke an incident like this. Wefeel we've been railroaded into this situation,'' Martin said.   State and federal law enforcement officers have not beenpermitted to enter the territory since it was established in 1979.   ``We set up our own barricades to protect our people. It was anatural thing for us to do,'' Martin said early today after Indianrepresentatives met with state and federal authorities to try toresolve the issue.   ``Our law is that no outside law enforcement are allowed. Wefeel they're pointing the finger at us,'' Martin said. ``They'rethreatening to do whatever they have to.''   One meeting among state officials, FBI agents and Mohawkrepresentatives broke down late Friday, but talks resumed earlytoday, Garcia said.</TEXT></DOC>
