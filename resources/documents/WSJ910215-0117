The central bank's quarterly bulletin, which followed therelease of several gloomy economic indicators, attempted todispel the most baleful comparisons with the wrenchingrecession of the early 1980s.</LP><TEXT>   One important difference is that during the earlierdownturn, all the major economies were sinking intorecession. Today, &quot;world demand remains relatively buoyant,particularly in Europe, where the consequences of Germanunification are providing a substantial stimulus,&quot; the banksaid.   Separately, the British government announced the 10thconsecutive monthly rise in unemployment, bringing the totalnumber of jobless to 1.96 million. And capital spending byU.K. manufacturers fell 7.5% in the fourth quarter of 1990from the previous three months; capital spending was down15.3% from the year-ago period.   Still, the bank's analysis suggests that British industrycan weather the storm better than 10 years earlier. In theearly 1980s, British prices were significantly out of linewith those on the Continent, a competitive disadvantagethat's much slimmer today. In addition, British industrykeeps a closer watch of inventories these days, and as aresult &quot;there's less fat to trim&quot; now that the recession hasset in, according to the bulletin.   The Bank of England's assurances indicate that thecountry's economic managers aren't likely to shift away fromtheir adherence to the exchange-rate mechanism of theEuropean Monetary System. The bank said the EMS, which someBritish industrialists and economists are attacking, &quot;is seenas a powerful influence&quot; for the easing of inflation. Thebank added that all EMS members share a &quot;determination toavoid realignment.&quot;   The high interest-rate policy of Germany is preventingother EMS countries from dropping their interest rates asmuch as their slowing economies might dictate. The pound wasbrought into the monetary system in October at a medianexchange rate of 2.95 marks -- a level critics say is forcingthe British government to maintain excessively high interestrates. This week, the U.K. cut base interest rates by half apercentage point to 13.5% -- still relatively high for acountry that's in a recession.   The Bank of England, in its report, said that &quot;fiscaltightening&quot; in Germany could help combat the inflationarypressure that's been stirred up by the massive spending informer East Germany, and enable the Bundesbank to maintain amore relaxed monetary policy.   The Bank of England also suggested that the Germaneconomic boom may be chilled by &quot;increased uncertaintyarising from events in the Baltic republics of the U.S.S.R.&quot;That, too, could ease some of the current strains in the EMS.</TEXT></DOC>
