SCHMID</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   An international conference concludedWednesday that the warming of the Earth from the ``greenhouseeffect'' is a crisis requiring massive scientific and politicalcoordination to stem the burning of fossil fuels and halve theemissions of carbon dioxide by the year 2030.   The effort must entail fundamental changes in lifestyle,including a rapid switch to solar, wind and other ``environmentallysound'' energy sources, new farming techniques and the abandonmentof some chemical products, the conference said.   It also recommended that the industrial nations forgive certaindebts of the Third World, as an incentive for poorer nations toconserve and replenish their tropical forests.   Representatives from 35 nations attended the three-day, GlobalGreenhouse Network First International Conference to formulaterecommendations for heading off what many scientists have warnedcould be a disastrous overheating of the Earth.   ``This crisis is of such overwhelming magnitude that it willrequire a truly global response,'' said Jeremy Rifkin, president ofthe Foundation on Economic Trends, which sponsored the meeting.   The greenhouse effect is a warming of the Earth caused by theincreasing concentration of carbon dioxide and other gases in theatmosphere.   The gases, largely a result of burning fossil fuels like coaland oil, allow radiation from the sun to warm the planet, but blockexcess heat from radiating back into space. The effect is similarto that of a greenhouse for growing plants.   ``Global warming is already occurring ... and the planet facesthe possibility of profound disruption in the coming decades,''said Philip Michael Kelly, a climatologist from the University ofEast Anglia in Norwich, England.   Scientists have warned that the consequences of even a slightglobal warming could include increased droughts and other severeeffects upon crop production. Moreover, they say it could melt theice caps, threatening coastal areas with higher seas, and evenproduce stronger hurricanes in future years.   Among the other recommendations of the conference:   _Taxes on use of carbon-based fuels and other penalties fordamaging the environment, targeted at industrialized nations. Themoney raised from these penalties would go to an international fundto assist nations seeking ways to cope with climate change.   _Rejection of nuclear, genetic-engineering and otherhigh-technology responses to the climate problem.   _Tax incentives and legislation to discourage use ofchlorofluorocarbons, a type of chemical used in refrigerators andother industrial processes which can damage the environment.   _Reduction of emissions of carbon dioxide by one-fifth by theyear 2000, and by half by 2030.   _Tax incentives and legislation to encourage energy efficiencyand conservation in industrial, residential and commercial uses.   _A switch by agriculture away from petrochemical fertilizers toorganic products.   ``It is recognized that these goals cannot be achieved withoutfundamental changes in lifestyle and consumption patterns in theindustrialized world and structural changes in socio-economicrelationships worldwide, '' the conference concluded.   The group also announced plans for a celebration of Global EarthDay in 1990, and designation of the 1990s as the EnvironmentalDecade.</TEXT></DOC>
