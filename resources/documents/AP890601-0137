The drug, epoetin, reduces the need for transfusions to add redblood cells to patients who under go dialysis because their kidneyshave failed, FDA Commissioner Frank Young announced.   Epoetin ``is great stuff'' said John G. Cole, an editor of TheJournal, Lorain, Ohio, a kidney patient who has participated intrials of the product over the last two years.   Once barely able to walk on the beach or carry out the garbage,Cole said he now plays half-court basketball, works 50-55 hours aweek and works out three times a week.   Young explained that patients with kidney failure often sufferanemia because of the loss of a natural chemical which stimulatestheir bodies to produce red clood cells.   Without those cells the body doesn't get enough oxygen, causinglsos of strength, chest pain and other problems.   In the past, transfusions have been used to provide new redcells, but with epoetin that will be unnecessary for most patients,Young said. The drug stimulates the body to make its own red cellsagain.   The kidney patients will still need regular dialysis treatments,he pointed out.   Epoetin is the eleventh drug to be licensed that is producedthrough genetic engineering techniques, said Young.   It was developed under the orphan drug program, designed tostimulate research on drugs needed by fewer than 200,000 people.Young said about 95,000 kidney patients would likely use the newdrug, although it could also prove useful for people with othermedical problems which cause anemia, includine AIDS and some formsof cancer.</TEXT></DOC>
