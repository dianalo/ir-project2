Sky Television, owned by Murdoch's News Corp., alleged in thesuit filed Monday that Disney and several of its subsidiariesrefused to follow terms of a joint venture announced last year toprovide two subscription satellite television services to Britainand Ireland.   The first of several satellite-to-home television servicesexpected in the United Kingdom in coming years, the internationalventure was to have been up and running this month or in June.   But the lawsuit, filed in Los Angeles Superior Court, maintainsthat Disney has failed to start up the service as agreed. The courtaction also alleges that Disney refused to reimburse Sky's costsand that Disney has threatened to withdraw from the agreement ifnot granted more favorable financial terms.   The suit asks for $500 million in general damages and $1 billionin punitive damages. It further requests that Disney be preventedfrom signing a new agreement with another television subscriptionservice in the United Kingdom.   Tom Deegan, Disney's director of corporate communications, wouldnot comment on the specifics of the suit.   ``We have great regard for Mr. Murdoch and the accomplishmentsof his organizations,'' Deegan said. ``But we are surprised at thissuit which has absolutely no merit.''   Under the original agreement, announced in a splashy newsconference last November, viewers in Britain and Ireland withsatellite dishes were to receive News Corp.'s Sky Movies, a newfeature film and entertainment service, and the Disney Channel ontwo separate channels.   Both companies declined to say how much they were investing inthe deal.   Disney was to have supplied 18 hours of daily programming, withchildren's shows in the day and family entertainment and mainstreamprograms at night. Sky Movies, started earlier this year, featuresmovies from 20th Century Fox, another of Murdoch's News Corp.'ssubsidiaries.   The venture was to have given Disney a foothold in a new marketas it expands globally, including the planned 1992 opening of aEuropean Disneyland near Paris. Sky Television was to havebenefited from the name-brand recognition of a family-orientedproduction company.   The two pay channels were to be sold as a package, withsubscribers charged a monthly fee of about $22 for the service.Subscribers also needed to purchase or rent a satellite decodingdevice.   News Corp. chief executive Murdoch said at the venture's launchthat he hoped 1 million satellite dishes would be in use in Britainand Ireland by early 1990, and that he expected the pay service tobecome profitable within two to three years.   Murdoch's Fox Broadcasting Corp., while hardly a rival for thethree U.S. television networks, has enjoyed some steady audiencegrowth in recent months. The Disney Channel, a domestic paytelevision service, now claims more than 4 million U.S. subscribers.</TEXT></DOC>
