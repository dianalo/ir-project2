Talks were scheduled to resume at 1 p.m. today, according tofederal mediator Jack Buettner.   Principals and administrative staff will reopen four highschools Monday for 3,600 seniors, Superintendent Alfred Tutelasaid. Teachers had planned to strike Thursday, but the districtdeclared a snow day and closed all buildings.   School officials and Cleveland Teachers Union members declinedto discuss the school board's latest offer, which was made at 6:30a.m. Thursday after two days of negotiations.   At a regularly scheduled school board meeting Thursday evening,Mildred Madison, board president, said she believed the board hadmade a fair offer.   More than 100 students and teachers attended the meeting, andmany were unhappy over negotiating efforts by school officials.   ``It's the students who really need the education here,'' ReubinFitzhugh, a senior at Cleveland's Aviation High School, told theboard. ``You have your education. Why can't we have ours?''   The school board reportedly has dropped its demand that amandatory career ladder system be included in the new contract,leaving wages as the major unresolved issue. A career ladder systemwould have linked teacher advancement and pay raises to performanceevaluations.   The school board initially offered a one-time 2 percent bonuspayment, with further raises contingent on passage of a tax levy.Union president Eugene Kolach said the board had revised its offerto a 2 percent raise retroactive to September, and another 1percent raise retroactive to Jan. 1. A pay raise in the second yearwould be linked to a levy approval.   Beginning Cleveland teachers are paid $17,600 a year. Theaverage teacher makes $29,000 annually and the highest paid teachermakes just more than $34,600. Of the 5,093 union members, 2,559 areclassroom teachers.   The last teachers strike in the district lasted 11 weeks in 1979.</TEXT></DOC>
