This paper compares preliminarytest plans for the Nevada, Washington, and Texas sites, identifying differencesand similarities among them. The final test plans will reflect an approachrecently adopted by the Department of Energy (DOE) to address each ofthe siting and licensing requirements in Federal regulations for geologicrepositories. This approach is discussed, and the rationale for determiningparameter needs and linking those needs to the test plans is presented.An example of how this rationale is used to identify specific tests isprovided.</TEXT></DOC>
