While it contains sectionsof clinical features it is not intended that readers should rely entirelyupon these for the diagnosis and management of the injured patient. Asin the diagnosis and treatment of all medical problems, fracture managementmust be carried out in a logical step-by-step fashion - namely, history,examination, investigation, differential diagnosis, diagnosis and thentreatment. Each section deals with a specific anatomical area and beginswith line drawings of the normal radiographs demonstrating the anatomy.Accessory views that may be requested, and the indications for these,are included. Any radiological pitfalls for the area in general are thendescribed. The fractures in adults are then examined in turn, their radiologicalfeatures described, and any pitfalls in their diagnosis discussed. Abrief note of important clinical findings is included. A brief mentionis made of pediatric fractures which are of significance and their differencesto the adult pattern indicated. Although fractures can be classifiedinto types with different characteristics, in life every fracture isindividual. Fractures by and large follow common patterns, but many havevariations.</TEXT></DOC>
