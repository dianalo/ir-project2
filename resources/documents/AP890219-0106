U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills, holding her firstdiscussions as the Bush administration's top trade negotiator, saidSaturday substantial progress had been made in the two days of talkswith representatives of the 12-nation European Community.   Frans Andriessen, the EC's top trade negotiator, said Sunday theagreement could help the two sides resolve the meat dispute.   ``I don't say we are close to a solution, but I think we are nowin a situation which makes it easier to come to a solution,''Andriessen said upon returning to Brussels from Washington.   The two sides agreed to establish a high-level task force tostudy the issue over the next 75 days with the goal of coming upwith ways to export hormone-free American beef to Europe.   The task force will also consider an American demand that a panelof experts should be established to consider whether growth hormonesconstitute a health risk.   ``We made good progress in working out a procedure with respectto our differences in the hormone area,'' Mrs. Hills told reportersafter the meeting ended. ``We have a high-level task force to dealwith that issue, to work out the differences if at all possible.''   Andriessen said talks with officials of the new Bushadministration gave him the impression ``we have a very positiveenvironment for cooperation.''   He said U.S. officials still contested the prohibition againsthormone-treated beef, but ``they have accepted now that to ship themeat (they) have to comply with our requirements.''   Both President Bush and European officials have expressed adesire to defuse the trade dispute, fearing that the battle couldaggravate tensions just at a time when the new administration istrying to forge closer ties with its European allies.   The current trade dispute began on Jan. 1 when the Europeansimposed a ban on shipments of U.S. beef because the meat containedgrowth hormones used to fatten American cattle.   The Reagan administration charged that the European action, whichaffected about $100 million in annual meat shipments, represented anunfair trade barrier and that there was no scientific evidence thatthe hormones were a health threat.   In retaliation, the Americans slapped 100 percent tariffs on $100million worth of European products, ranging from canned tomatoes tofruit wines and instant coffee. Those tariffs are just now showingup in higher prices at U.S. grocery stores.   The weekend negotiations were held in an effort to avoid acounter-retaliatory step threatened by the Europeans on Monday, whenthe governing body of the European Community will meet to considerimposing 100 percent tariffs on $100 million of American exports ofwalnuts and dried fruit.   Andriessen said Saturday he could not speak for the EuropeanCouncil of Ministers but he indicated that the progress made in thetalks would likely postpone the second round of retaliation.   Andriessen told reporters at a later briefing Saturday the UnitedStates had indicated it would lower its $100 million in tariffs byan amount equal to the shipments of hormone-free beef that theUnited States is able to make.   He said consideration would be given to doubling the quota forhigh-grade beef. Last year, the United States shipped $32 millionworth of such beef to Europe. Such a step would make it moreprofitable for U.S. ranchers to raise hormone-free beef.   Mrs. Hills and Andriessen also reported progress between the twosides over the U.S. demand to end all trade-distorting farmsubsidies, a position the Europeans have strongly objected to.   A U.S. official, briefing reporters on the condition that theofficial's name not be used, said that the United States offered anew proposal on the contentious farm subsidy issue and the matterwas to be discussed by Mrs. Hills, Andriessen, Agriculture SecretaryClayton Yeutter and Ray MacSharry, the European Community'scommissioner in charge of agriculture, during talks on March 10 and11 in Brussels.   The current round of talks being held to liberalize world trade,known as the Uruguay Round, have been stalled because of Americanand European differences over farm subsidies.   European officials characterized the get-acquainted talks, whichalso included Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher, as helpful inunderstanding the position of the new administration.   Trade between the United States and the European Communitytotaled $165 billion last year, making the 12-nation communityAmerica's largest trading partner.   Bush, referring to the beef dispute in his first address toCongress, said last week that the major industrial countries needed``to rise above fighting about beef hormones to building a betterfuture, to move from protectionism to progress.''   A basis for compromise on the beef question was put forward byTexas Agriculture Commissioner Jim Hightower.   The Texas plan would involve isolating untreated cattle frombirth through slaughter, giving them tests for artificial hormonesand establishing enforcement procedures. Texas officials say thatsimilar programs meeting European standards have been proposed byBrazil and New Zealand.   American officials have been anxious to get the dispute resolvedbecause the battle had raised questions about American beef.   ``The health ban is a signal that something is wrong with ourbeef,'' Mrs. Hills said last week. ``Nothing is wrong with ourbeef.''   Nearly half of American cattle are now treated with growthhormones. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has maintainedthroughout the dispute that the daily production of hormones inhumans, even in children, is far higher than the miniscule levelsleft in meat from treated animals.</TEXT></DOC>
