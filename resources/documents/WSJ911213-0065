But a report issued a few weeks ago by the Institute ofMedicine (IOM) in Washington says malaria has made a dramaticresurgence. Sickness and death &quot;are at almost unprecedentedlevels&quot; and increasing rapidly. &quot;The outlook for malariacontrol is grim . . . we are slipping behind the parasites .. . we are down to our last drugs . . . new tools aredesperately needed.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   What went wrong? Robert S. Desowitz, professor of tropicalmedicine and medical microbiology at the University ofHawaii, blames bureaucratic bumbling and scientific hubris.His book, &quot;The Malaria Capers: More Tales of Parasites andPeople, Research and Reality&quot; (Norton, 288 pages, $21.95), isa gripping account of how a one-celled protozoan hastriumphed over modern science.   &quot;In 1990 -- in this age of rocket ships and geneticengineering -- 250 million people will get malaria and atleast 2.5 million people will die&quot; of it, he writes, twice asmany as only a decade ago. &quot;In regions of intensetransmission, 40 percent of the toddlers may die of acutemalaria.&quot; The disease is found in 102 countries. In warmclimates favorable for mosquitoes, hundreds of millions areinfected more or less constantly.   Man and malaria go back a long time. &quot;The cuneiformmedical writings of the Sumerians repeatedly describe thetypical fevers of malaria,&quot; writes Dr. Desowitz, &quot;the Chinesemedical classic of 2700 B.C., the Nei Ching, also gives anaccurate description.&quot; Hippocrates thought &quot;a dank effluviumrising from the marshes caused an imbalance of the bodilyhumors.&quot; Malaria is mentioned in the writings of Aristotle,Plato, Horace, Chaucer, and Shakespeare, and it killed Dante.Horace Walpole introduced the modern word when he wrote fromRome in 1740 of &quot;A horrid thing called mal'aria {bad air}that comes to Rome every summer and kills one.&quot;   The first sighting of the protozoan was made in 1880 by aFrench army physician in Algeria. In 1897, British surgeonRonald Ross, working in India, demonstrated that the diseasewas transmitted by the bite of a mosquito. Italianinvestigators led by Giovanni Battista Grassi were the firstto show in 1898 that human malaria is transmitted byanopheline mosquitoes.   Ross advocated attacking the mosquito where it bred. Butthe eminent German bacteriologist Robert Koch disdained&quot;swatting flies&quot;; his dictum was &quot;treat the patient, not themosquito.&quot; These two &quot;stubborn, opinionated men,&quot; writes Dr.Desowitz, &quot;so permanently polarized the approach to malariacontrol that integrated, multifaceted campaigns have neverbeen carried out except for some rather half-hearted pilotprojects.&quot;   Ross's vector strategy resulted in the draining of swampsand other mosquito breeding grounds. It also promptedwidespread use of insecticides -- which ultimately made thecurrent generation of anophelines resistant: DDT doesn't fazethem. &quot;No amount of DDT alone could ever cause theinterruption of transmission,&quot; notes Dr. Desowitz.   Koch thought the parasite could be drugged intosubmission. Chloroquine (Aralen) was the kind of agent hesought. &quot;However,&quot; notes Dr. Desowitz, &quot;over the years thewidespread use of chloroquine led to the selection ofresistant strains&quot; of the parasites. Today, multi-drugresistant strains are found throughout the world andtreatment is &quot;a therapeutic challenge.&quot; In severely afflictedAfrica, infected patients -- if they reach a hospital at all-- run the risk of receiving AIDS through unscreened bloodtransfusions.   What about a vaccine to create immunity? Unfortunately,the malaria parasite undergoes a dozen stages of developmentand &quot;all stages are different; each would require its ownvaccine . . . There are notable exceptions to protection byvaccine -- the common cold, and AIDS. And malaria,&quot; hewrites. But this has not stopped the U.S. Agency forInternational Development (AID) of looking &quot;for a quick fix,&quot;claims Dr. Desowitz.   Part of his book is an attack on AID &quot;amateurs&quot; who havespent $100 million on vaccine research that has little hopeof success. In a final chapter, &quot;The Vaccine Felonies,&quot; hedescribes how a few scientists were corrupted by all thatmoney: &quot;One is in jail. One is about to go on trial, indictedfor theft, criminal solicitation, and conspiracy. Two othershave been indicted for theft. Others are underinvestigation.&quot;   Today, there is no more talk of eradication, nor of a&quot;magic bullet.&quot; Disillusioned health authorities pursue themore modest goal of reducing sickness and death to tolerablelevels. Research continues (though the IOM report notes that&quot;anti-malarial drug discovery and development is of littleinterest to pharmaceutical firms&quot;). But control, cure orprevention all require sustained funding -- precisely whatthe poor, tropical countries where malaria is endemic do nothave.   ---   Mr. Burns is a free-lance writer in Washington, D.C.</TEXT></DOC>
