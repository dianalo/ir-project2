Its proposal, in a request filed with the FederalCommunications Commission, calls for replacing traditionalrate-base regulation with a cap on prices at the currentlevels. The benefit to the company is that although itsprices would be capped, its costs are declining, so itsprofit margin would actually improve. But the company alsosaid it needed to be able to adjust its rates downwardquickly to stay competitive with the growing fiber-opticinternational business.</LP><TEXT>   The company provides satellite linkups for long-distancecarriers such as American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co., MCICommunications Corp. and US Sprint, a unit of UnitedTelecommunications Inc. Although these companies areincreasingly active in the fiber-optic business, they alsodepend on satellites to reach places that aren't yet servedby fiber-optics and as a backup for any disruptions infiber-optic lines.   Under traditional rate-base regulation, the company'sinternational phone service business is limited to a returnon investment of 12.48%. But because of exploding demand forinternational communications and declining satellitetransmission costs, the company has had to consistently cutrates to remain within the authorized rate of return, saidCharles Schelke, an analyst with Smith Barney, Harris Upham andamp;Co. New rates that took effect January reflected cuts of upto 58%, totaling approximately $14 million.   Betty C. Alewine, president of Comsat World Systems, whichoversees the international phone service business, said thenew form of regulation would make the company morecompetitive with the fiber-optic transmission business byallowing it to adjust rates quickly without having to gothrough regulatory proceedings.   International phone service accounts for about 30% ofComsat's total revenue, which in 1990 was $456.8 million.   While Comsat currently is the only company in the U.S.that is allowed to connect its satellite service to the U.S.phone network and carry international calls, it faces strongcompetition from fiber-optic cables. In addition, privatesatellite companies recently have been allowed to provideservices to private line networks and are likely to beallowed to connect with public phone networks by 1997.</TEXT></DOC>
