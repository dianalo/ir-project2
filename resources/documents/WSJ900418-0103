The proposal to crack down on the practice known as dualtrading was proposed in April 1989 by an exchange panel afteran undercover investigation of futures trading at the ChicagoMerc and the Chicago Board of Trade surfaced in January 1989.</LP><TEXT>   The practice has been widely scorned for making abuseharder to detect. The Commodity Futures Trading Commissionwants the exchanges to experiment with prohibiting dualtrading in a few pits entirely.   The Chicago Merc, which opposes that measure, saidyesterday that it will ask the regulatory agency to insteadapprove its member-adopted proposal.   The way the Chicago Merc proposal differs is that morepits would be involved, but not all the contracts in thosepits.   In each pit, traders swap contracts that expire atdifferent months throughout the year. In the hog pit, forexample, members are currently trading contracts that expirein eight different months.   Under the Chicago Merc proposal, dual trading would bebanned in contract months in which at least 10,000 contractson average are traded daily over a six-month period.   Based on that volume, the dual trading prohibition wouldprobably apply to the contracts that are nearing expirationin the pits that trade futures contracts for financial andcurrency instruments such as the yen and the Swiss franc.   But the rule probably would mean that dual trading couldcontinue in some lower-volume futures contracts forcommodities such as livestock.   The Chicago Merc said 76% of its members who votedapproved the proposal, which was also approved by its Boardof Governors in March.   In 1987, the Chicago Merc banned dual trading for itsmost-active stock-index futures brokers.</TEXT></DOC>
