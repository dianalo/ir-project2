The experimental results are compared to pre-experimentRELAP5/MOD2 calculations, and finally are related to expected pressurizedwater reactor (PWR) behavior during SBLOCA conditions. The simulationconducted in the Semiscale MOD-2C scaled-experiment facility was a 0.5%cold leg centerline break performed at high temperature and pressurewith initial conditions typical of a PWR (15.6-MPa pressure, 587-K hotleg fluid temperature). The Semiscale MOD-2C facility represents allmajor components of a large PWR. The facility includes active loops,steam generators, and a vessel with an electrically heated core. Thetransition from forced circulation to the various modes of natural circulationwas characterized in the Semiscale simulation. The natural circulationcooling modes observed include single-phase, two-phase, and reflux. Analysisincluded extensive decoupling of natural circulation heat rejection modesbetween the loops, and multi-dimensional effects within the steam generatorU-tubes. Comparison of RELAP5/MOD2 calculations with data shows correctqualitative calculation of the occurrence of single-phase two-phase,and reflux cooling during the Semiscale transient. Analysis of similitudecriteria for the Semiscale facility suggests that the Semiscale resultspreserve the first order effects though important for natural circulationphenomena expected in a PWR.</TEXT></DOC>
