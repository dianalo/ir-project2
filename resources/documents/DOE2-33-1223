<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-33-1223 </DOCNO><TEXT>A comprehensive theoretical study with concurrent supporting experimentalinvestigations has been started on coherent and semicoherent interfacesin ferroelastic martensites, including twin boundaries and twin bands,heterophase parent/product interfaces and inclusions, and transformationprecursors. This work is motivated by the need for understanding therelation between bulk properties and domain configurations, and the natureof transformation precursors and their role in the martensite nucleationmechanism. The theory is based on a nonlinear, nonlocal anisotropic elasticcontinuum model for proper FE martensites which can be used to calculatethe twin boundary energy and strain profile as well as the pretransformationstrain modulation from second and higher order elastic constants andfrom phonon dispersion data. Furthermore, we have calculated the strainenergy associated with habit plane interfaces and studied the dynamicalproperties of twin boundaries and their effect on the specific heat andon the superconducting transition temperature. Based on our theoreticalresults, we have also proposed a heuristic model for martensite formationwhich involves the pretransformation modulation as intermediate stepand would require only less potent defects for heterogeneous nucleationthan according to the prevailing view. 15 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
