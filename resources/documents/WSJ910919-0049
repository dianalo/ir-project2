But now the inexpensive hotel is turningout to be a new concept in advertising.   Increasingly, such hotels as Marriott, Hyatt and Hiltonare running ads touting prices that are only $10 or $20 morethan the rates of some roadside dives. It is an effort todrum up business in a lackluster year, and the hotel hype hasbeen one rare bright spot in a severe advertising recession.</LP><TEXT>   But even some hotel executives concede this is riskyground for an industry so obsessed with image and luxury.Moreover, the bogus bargains claimed in some top-name hotelads threaten to anger customers and do further damage to someclassy reputations.   Hotels have spent millions on new lobbies, health clubsand various marketing programs, all to differentiatethemselves from competitors. Now, frets Mike Ribero, a seniorvice president at Hilton Hotels Corp., &quot;As an industry, we'respending a lot of money telling people how cheap we are, nothow good our service is. That can be destructive.&quot;   Advertising with such a heavy accent on discounts &quot;onlytells the customer to pick hotels just on price,&quot; says JackTrout of Trout andamp; Ries, a marketing consultant in Greenwich,Conn. &quot;It destroys brand loyalty and turns hotels into acommodity.&quot;   The push to be inexpensive can backfire with businesstravelers, in particular. They often are more keen on servicethan price because their employers are paying the bill. Tosome degree, chains recognize this and run more conservativespots on the evening news and in other TV programs thatappeal to this group. &quot;There's an excruciatingly delicatebalance to strike here,&quot; says Marc Yanofsky, senior vicepresident of marketing at Hyatt Corp.   Most hotels are pushing price out of desperation. Theindustry has been in the dumps for five years, at firstbecause of glut of newly built properties and more recentlybecause of the nation's recession. In 1990, the industry hadlosses totaling about $350 million, and its vacancy ratetoday is 35% to 40%.   Faced with these vacancies, even upscale chains shiftedfrom strictly service-oriented ads to price promotions. About75% of Marriott Corp.'s hotel ads now plug low room rates --$39 a day, in some cases -- while the remaining 25% of itsads focus on service. In the mid-1980s, the ratio was thereverse. &quot;You have to work a lot harder to get customers,&quot;says Jackie Hurley, Marriott's ad director.   The Hilton chain currently hammers pricing in about halfof all ads, although it plans to reduce that to 35% nextyear. And some of the toniest inns shudder at the thought ofbeing so crass as to talk price. &quot;We appeal to a smallmarketplace that isn't oriented that way,&quot; says a spokeswomanfor Ritz-Carlton Hotels, where some suites go for more than$1,000 a night.   Successful or not, the price-peddling ads have at leastbeen a godsend for the recession-riddled ad world. While manyindustries have cut back, hotels and resorts tripled their adbudgets from 1987 to 1990, to $637 million. In the first halfof 1991, hotel ad spending rose less than 1%, but thatcompares with a 7.8% drop for all advertising, according toLeading National Advertisers, which collects dataadvertising.   Just one problem: Hotels aren't even delivering on some ofthese eye-catching bargains because many of the deals areloaded with restrictions. Experts say that's only to going toalienate more customers. Chekitan Dev, marketing professor atCornell University's Hotel School, says, &quot;You really harmyourself when you start playing some of the games airlinesdo.&quot;   Hotels are risking years of good will by bannering theirbargains without heavily highlighting all the restrictions.Usually the deals are valid only for a limited number ofrooms, and only on certain days -- but it says so only in thetiny print buried at the bottom of the page.   Marriott introduced the hotel industry's firstnonrefundable rates, long a sore point among customers ofairlines that do the same thing. But hotels have come up withsome new twists that even the airlines didn't think of. Arecent ad promoting a $240 weekend rate at New York's Pierre,part of the Four Seasons Hotels Inc. chain, bears apicturesque view of the hotel as seen from the greenery ofCentral Park. But in extremely fine print, the ad mentionsthat the rate doesn't apply to rooms with a view of the park.Those rooms continue to cost $430 a night.   Other hotel ads list cheap rates that turn out to requiretwo people staying in the room, each paying the advertisedrate. Stephen Gardner, an assistant attorney general inTexas, says the practice is &quot;clearly misleading.&quot; But hehasn't received enough complaints to warrant a probe. Therate might rarely work for single people traveling alone, henotes, &quot;depending on how much luck they have before they getto the room.&quot;   ---   Zwiren Joins Needham                                                                                                          Jan Zwiren has resigned as chief executive officer ofAyer's Chicago office to join Omnicom's DDB Needham unit,adding to speculation that Ayer may sell its Chicagooperation.   But Ayer spokesperson Victoria Horstmann denied rumorsthat Ayer would shed its Chicago office. &quot;We're staying inChicago,&quot; she said. &quot;We're trying to shore it up with addedsevices, like creative media research out of New York. We'rereinforcing the ties between New York and Chicago.&quot;   Ms. Zwiren, who wasn't available for comment, left ZwirenAyer, as the Chicago office had been known, to becomedirector of strategic business development at DDB Needham'sChicago office. New York-based Ayer's Chicago office will nowbe known as Ayer Chicago, and its chief operating officer,Frank Maher, assumes the top post of general manager.   Ayer acquired Ms. Zwiren's small agency less than twoyears ago, merging it with its own Chicago office and havingMs. Zwiren report directly to the president of Ayer U.S.A.,Dom Rossi. Her successor, Mr. Maher, will report to DeanProctor, an executive vice president in Ayer's New Yorkoffice. Ayer Chairman Jerry Siano couldn't be reached forcomment on rumors that the Chicago operation may be sold.   In addition, Tim Prosch, director of account services inthe Chicago office, and John Trusk, creative director, werenamed managing directors.   ---   Possible Ad Ban in Oregon                                                                                                          Voters in Oregon may get the chance to vote on whether toban virtually all alcohol and tobacco advertising in theirstate. But the Association of National Advertisers isfighting to keep the issue off the ballot.   Two Oregon residents, Anthony Taylor and Cheryl MacDonald,are collecting signatures to get their proposed ban on theballot for the November 1992 election. Included would be allforms of media advertising for alcohol and tobacco products,except &quot;ads on packages that aren't used for display,&quot; andlogos on letterhead and in trade journals.   But the advertiser group's executive vice president,Daniel L. Jaffe, has urged Oregon's secretary of state torefuse to accept the ballot initiative, claiming it violatesthe state's constitution and that it &quot;raises serious concernsabout the constitutional protections afforded by the U.S.Supreme Court to commercial speech.&quot;   A draft of the proposed initiative contends: &quot;Promoting orglamourizing cigarettes, tobacco products and alcohol adds tosocial problems and conflicts with sensible drug policy.Effects of these acts should be minimized.&quot; The ANA hopes topursue the matter with Oregon officials.   ---   Ad Notes. . . .
