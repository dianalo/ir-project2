The price of the corn contractfor December delivery slipped 1.25 cents a bushel to settleat $2.4975 a bushel.   U.S. grain officials had expected the Soviet Union toquickly use the guarantees to arrange bank credit to purchaseas much as 1.2 million metric tons of U.S. wheat, as well asquantities of soybeans and corn. However, snags weredeveloping before Mr. Shevardnadze's resignation.   Earlier this week, the U.S. government reportedly balkedat a request by Moscow to use part of the U.S.-backed creditto pay for the expense of shipping the U.S. foodstuffs toSoviet ports. The U.S. government apparently wants Moscow touse the credit solely to buy U.S. goods.   &quot;The resignation casts a further pall on the outlook forany quick shipments to the Soviet Union,&quot; said RobertLekberg, an analyst at Farmers Grain andamp; Livestock Corp.,Chicago. &quot;We don't know who is in charge.&quot;   Soybean prices also were depressed by reports that theSoviet Union bought a large amount of soybean meal from SouthAmerican sources instead of the U.S.   The U.S. credit guarantees were granted in part becausecredit problems had prompted the Soviet Union to slash itspurchases of U.S. crops, which in turn had depressed theprices received by U.S. farmers for corn, wheat and soybeans.   Some U.S. traders are speculating that prices of corn andsoybean futures contracts will approach theirlife-of-contract lows unless U.S. exports increase soon.   In other commodity markets yesterday:                                                                                                          ENERGY: Petroleum futures trading on the New YorkMercantile Exchange was extremely thin in a session traderstermed &quot;dead.&quot; Market players seemed more focused on holidayparties than on the Persian Gulf crisis that has dominatedoil market news in recent months. Generally, prices fell withthe only exception being the two nearest months of heatingoil futures contracts. Spurred by forecasts of harsh weatherencroaching upon the northeastern U.S., January heating oilprices rose 1.04 cents a gallon to settle at 78.88 cents. TheNortheast, the nation's principal heating oil market, hasseen unseasonably warm weather so far this winter. And sometraders doubt that the Northeast will see quite as severe acold wave as some of the rest of the country has. Still,dropping temperatures forced analysts and others to take noteof the supply picture for heating oil, which reflects thehalting of certain exports from Saudi Arabia. In crude,February contracts lost 54 cents a barrel to end the day at$26.39.                                                                                                          COPPER: Futures prices were strong, with the Marchcontract trading as high as $1.1130 a pound. It ended at$1.1005, up 1.15 cents a pound. The March contract traded ata low of $1.0550 on Dec. 7, but has since been locked in arange between $1.06 and $1.09, noted Richard Hirsch, metalstrader for Sharps Pixley Inc., New York metals brokers. Thefact that the contract rose above $1.10, a key resistancelevel, and retained the gain yesterday indicates that thecopper market is strong, despite the continued buildup ofcopper supplies, Mr. Hirsch said. One factor that enabled themarket to rise sharply was that traders who had previouslysold short had to buy contracts to cover their positions asprices rose, he said.                                                                                                          PRECIOUS METALS: Futures prices were mixed, with silverstrong, gold easier and platinum slightly higher. Marchdelivery silver ended with a gain of $10.30 cents an ounce at$4.2630, after rising as high as $4.40 (an intraday gain of24 cents) in early trading. February gold was off $1.30 anounce at $386.70. April platinum ended with a gain of $2 anounce at $423.90, but was well off its high for the day of$429. The thinness of the pre-holiday market contributed tosilver's strong advance, analysts said. The advance also wasaccelerated as the March contract rose through several keyresistance levels until it reached its high of the day, theysaid. The fact that it fell back so sharply from its bestlevel indicated that it was mostly a technical market, oneanalyst said. Continued uncertainty in the Persian Gulf wasalso a price-firming factor, according to analysts. Theresignation of Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadzeshould have had more impact on platinum than on silverbecause the Soviet Union is the world's second-largestproducer of platinum, and any internal unrest could affectthat nation's output, one analyst said.   ORANGE JUICE: Futures prices shot up on concern about aforecast of a cold front moving into California's citrusproducing areas. The January contract ended with a gain of9.95 cents a pound at $1.20, just under its intraday high of$1.2005. Wayne Barnes, a meteorologist at Weather ServicesCorp., in Bedford, Mass., said an Arctic cold wave thatbrought heavy snow to Seattle late Tuesday was moving downinto California. Frost advisories have been issued forSouthern California, including the citrus-growing areas, andtemperatures are expected to drop into the 20s tonight,tomorrow night and Sunday night. The coldest readings, in themid-20s, are expected tomorrow night and Sunday night, Mr.Barnes said. The anticipated cold wave is apparently evokingmemories of the devastating freeze that hit Florida aroundthis time last year and severely damaged the citrus cropthere, analysts said. But the California orange crop is minorcompared with Florida's, and the amount of oranges processedfor juice is even significantly smaller, said Merrill Lynchanalyst Judith Ganes. California is expected to produce onlyabout 20 million gallons of juice, while Florida's output isexpected to amount to 236 million gallons, Ms. Ganes said.She also noted that minor damage to the California crop couldbe more significant for the market than major damage thatmade some oranges unsuitable for picking and hauling. If onlycosmetic damage occurred, she said, it could result in moreoranges than normal going into processing for juice, addingan unexpected increase in the total orange juice supply.</TEXT></DOC>
