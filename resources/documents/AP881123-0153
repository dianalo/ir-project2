The 40-year-old Nemeth, a member of the ruling Communist PartyPolitburo, will be the youngest Hungarian premier since 1956. He waschosen to succeed Karoly Grosz, who said he would step down to focuson his position as party chief.   Nemeth's appointment is to be approved by parliament Thursday.Approval is expected.   Announcing the appointment, party Central Committee secretaryGyoergy Fejti said the government might introduce referendums onunspecified issues in the next few years.   Such a reform could give Hungarians a direct voice indecision-making. The only East bloc country to have attempted such amove is Poland.   ``There should be the possibility for citizens to make decisionsdirectly,'' Fejti told a news conference. He said citizensthemselves could initiate such referendums, but emphasized thatparliament would have the final say on passing any new laws.   Nemeth, an advocate of market reform who spent a year studying atHarvard University, will have the task of overseeing extensiveeconomic and political change.   He is expected to guide the country into a period of austeritycertain to irritate Hungarians, many of whom have grown accustomedto driving into neighboring Austria on shopping sprees for Westerngoods.   Before 1990 when a new constitution is to be adopted, parliamentis to pass a series of laws designed to introduce market forces intothe economy and to restructure political institutions.   Nemeth came to the ruling Politburo with the younger, morereform-oriented leadership that accompanied Grosz when he replacedJanos Kadar as party chief in a major reshuffle in May.   A graduate of Budapest's prestigious Karl Marx University ofEconomics and later a lecturer there, Nemeth first entered the upperechelons of power in June 1987, when he was named secretary foreconomics on the Communist Party's policy-setting Central Committee.   Nemeth has warned that neglecting deeper trade ties with theEuropean Economic Community could hamper the country's development.   Last month, parliament adopted legislation to ease restrictionson foreign ownership and joint ventures and further the flow offoreign capital into Hungary.   Like Grosz, Nemeth advocates a socialist market-style economy,blending state ownership with private initiative and substantiallycutting subsidies to loss-making heavy industry.   In a nine-page article in the November issue of the monthlySocial Review, Nemeth cited as a model for Hungary's future theexample of large U.S. oil corporations leasing gas stations tofamily operators.   In the article, widely seen as an informal program for hisgovernment, Nemeth also praised the McDonalds hamburger chain as anexample of combining large-scale management with individual serviceand initiative.   The premier-designate seems undeterred by the prospect of as manyas 100,000 people unemployed by 1990 if the austerity program isfully impelemented.   He may, however, be hampered in implementing reforms both byconservatives in the Communist Party and by popular discontent.   Grappling with double-digit inflation, the East bloc's firstpersonal income tax and a fall in real incomes, Hungariansincreasingly are demanding more say in how their country is run.   In December, parliament is due to adopt legislation regulatingthe establishment of independent groups, associations and unions.The new laws accept a multiparty system in principle.   Government leaders say further legislation is necessary todetermine the establishment and function of opposition parties.Those laws are not expected before 1990.   Also appointed Wednesday was Politburo member Reszo Nyers, whowas given the newly created post of minister of state for theeconomy.   Nyers' selection completes a comeback in Hungarian politics. Thefather of Hungary's pioneering economic reforms in the 1960s, Nyerswas dropped from the Politburo in 1974 when reforms were curbed.</TEXT></DOC>
