The indictments were the first substantial federalcriminal charges brought against BCCI since 1988, when thebank, then little-known in the U.S., was charged withmoney-laundering in federal court in Tampa, Fla.</LP><TEXT>   Critics in the Congress and elsewhere have questioned whyit took the U.S. so long to bring additional charges offinancial fraud in the matter, particularly when a countygrand jury in Manhattan and the Federal Reserve Board hadrespectively issued indictments and disciplinary orders inthe scandal as early as July.   But federal officials suggested that Friday's indictmentswere only the beginning of a new round of federal prosecutionin the scandal. Robert Mueller, head of the JusticeDepartment's criminal division, referred to the agency's&quot;continuing and expanding investigation of BCCI and itsofficials,&quot; adding that the BCCI investigation is being&quot;carried out by scores of prosecutors and investigators.&quot;   Acting Attorney General William Barr added that theindictment represented &quot;one more important step in theaggressive federal prosecution of BCCI.&quot; The department, headded, &quot;is pursuing all aspects of the cases relentlessly.&quot;   The indictment, alleging several violations of securitiesand banking laws, named three men who are already well knownas principal figures in the scandal:   -- Agha Hasan Abedi, the mercurial founder of BCCIHoldings (Luxembourg) S.A., who, according to the indictment,engaged with his two collaborators in a racketeeringconspiracy to commit bank fraud, wire fraud and mail fraud,in connection with a number of financial transactionsinvolving Independence Bank of Encino, Calif., and CenTrustSavings Bank of Miami. Mr. Abedi is in frail health andliving in Karachi, Pakistan, where officials have vowed hewould never be extradited to the U.S.   -- Swaleh Naqvi, the former president of BCCI, who isalready under house arrest in Abu Dhabi was indicted for hispart in the alleged wrongdoings. The ruler of Abu Dhabicontrols BCCI, and it is unclear whether the Gulf emiratewould ever permit Mr. Naqvi to stand trial in the U.S. orwhether it will bring a case against him in the United ArabEmirates.   -- Ghaith Pharaon, BCCI's globe-trotting front man,accused of hiding BCCI's ownership of Independence Bank andof involvement in a scheme to park $25 million of securitiesissued by scandal-plagued CenTrust Savings Bank in Miami. Mr.Pharaon, who owned about 25% of CenTrust, was also anintegral part of the scheme to park securities to &quot;deceiveregulators and investors as to the true market for CenTrustsubordinated debentures,&quot; according to the indictment.   &quot;We will make every effort to have {the three men} broughtto the United States to stand trial,&quot; said the JusticeDepartment's Mr. Mueller. But the department recognizes thatit won't be easy. &quot;We have no extradition with Pakistan atthis time,&quot; Jay Stephens, U.S. attorney for the District ofColumbia, told reporters. &quot;With Abu Dhabi, with regard toNaqvi, we have made a request for Mr. Naqvi.&quot; Mr. Muellersaid the department would cooperate with the Manhattandistrict attorney who indicted BCCI and Messrs. Abedi andNaqvi on July 29.   While many have accused the Justice Department offoot-dragging in the case, a New York lawyer for Mr. Pharaoncharged exactly the opposite. Richard Lawler called theindictment &quot;a precipitous step motivated by the politicalfrenzy surrounding BCCI, rather than any action by GhaithPharaon.&quot; The indictment, he said, is &quot;clearly the result ofthe clamor in Congress and the criticism in the media of theJustice Department for the perceived failures in theinvestigation of BCCI.&quot;   Mr. Pharaon, said Mr. Lawler, &quot;believes he hasn't violatedany U.S. laws and has acted properly in his ownership ofIndependence Bank and in all of his dealings here in theU.S.&quot; Mr. Lawler said he had no idea of his client's currentwhereabouts.   R. Kenly Webster, a Washington lawyer who represents Mr.Naqvi, didn't return telephone calls. Mr. Abedi has beenunavailable for comment.   The indictments involve incidents that have already beenwidely reported, in this newspaper and elsewhere. Inaddition, Mr. Pharaon's allegedly fraudulent acquisition ofthe Encino-based bank had been extensively laid out early inthe summer by the Federal Reserve which, in turn, had actedon information provided by Manhattan District Attorney RobertMorgenthau. The Fed made a referral to the Justice Departmentconcerning possible criminal misrepresentation relating tothe ownership of Independence Bank.   The CenTrust matter has been under investigation by theU.S. attorney's office in Miami for more than a year. Itinvolves the intersection of the BCCI scandal and thesavings-and-loan debacle, in which the failure of CenTrustwill ultimately cost U.S. taxpayers more than $2 billion.</TEXT></DOC>
