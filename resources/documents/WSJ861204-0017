In a speech to U.S. and foreign business executives yesterday, Toyoo Gyohten, vice minister of finance for international affairs, said Japan has always welcomed &quot;trustworthy&quot; securities companies and banks and has made &quot;substantial progress&quot; in liberalizing its markets.    Many in the audience interpreted the remarks by Mr. Gyohten, considered one of Japan's most influential officials, as a sign that the country won't give in to foreign pressure for a speedup but will continue to deregulate its financial system at its own pace. In recent months, some U.S. lawmakers and bankers have urged barring Japanese financial institutions from becoming primary dealers in U.S. government securities until Japan grants comparable status to U.S. concerns.    The U.S. units of Japan's four largest securities companies -- Nomura Securities Co., Nikko Securities Co., Daiwa Securities Co. and Yamaichi Securities Co. -- are seeking primary-dealer status, which would allow them to conduct transactions directly with the Federal Reserve. And in late October, J. Henry Schroder Bank andamp; Trust Co., a U.S. unit of Industrial Bank of Japan, agreed to purchase Aubrey G. Lanston andamp; Co., a primary dealer.    Mr. Gyohten also said Japan doesn't plan to abandon its system of using a syndicate of Japanese financial institutions to sell long-term government debt in favor of an auction system. Japan has been criticized for not allocating more primary issues of government bonds to U.S. companies, and some of its critics have said an auction system would be one way for it to indicate a willingness to open its markets further. In a recent 20-year bond issue, the Japanese syndicate allocated a total of only 0.77% to 11 U.S. concerns.    The Ministry of Finance official said the syndicate manager recently polled major foreign banks and securities concerns in the syndicate and found that they were &quot;not dissatisfied&quot; with their shares and don't currently seek an increase.    A senior official of one major U.S. securities company, who didn't want to be identified, disputed the finding and said he wasn't aware his firm had been queried.    Mr. Gyohten also said the ministry is &quot;exploring positively the possibility for U.S. commercial banks to enter (the) Japanese securities market&quot; under the rules that govern European universal banks. Unlike the U.S. and Japan, which separate commercial and investment banking activities, most European countries allow banks to conduct both. These so-called universal banks can enter Japan's securities market through offshore affiliates in which they hold a 50% or smaller equity stake.    Several major U.S. banks, including Morgan Guaranty Trust Co., Bankers Trust Co. and Chemical Bank, are seeking securities licenses. Chase Manhattan Bank and Citibank have acquired them through British subsidiaries. </TEXT></DOC>
