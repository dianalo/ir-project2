The issue has immense attraction across the politicalspectrum because of the tax relief it offers both employersand their lower-class and middle-class workers. Maneuveringhas especially picked up among some Republicans stillsmarting over last year's budget debate, which left the GOPdepicted as the party of the rich.</LP><TEXT>   Supporters got a surprise boost this week from anendorsement by Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell -- thefirst from a congressional leader of either party in the yearsince Sen. Daniel Moynihan (D., N.Y.) first proposed to cutthe tax, which supports the Social Security and Medicareprograms. The leaders, like President Bush, have beenconcerned that the proposal would add to the deficit andthreaten the future solvency of Social Security.   &quot;I was happily surprised&quot; by Sen. Mitchell's statement,said Sen. Robert Kasten of Wisconsin, a GOP co-sponsor of theMoynihan proposal. &quot;There's growing support among mycolleagues, but more importantly, among outside groups&quot;representing business and labor.   &quot;I think it's very encouraging,&quot; said D.J. Gribbin of theNational Federation of Independent Business.   One House Democratic leader suggested Sen. Mitchellplugged the tax-cut proposal to get out in front of histroops on the issue, recognizing it might pass this year. Theendorsement is more widely seen as the Maine Democrat'scounterproposal to Mr. Bush's call for a capital-gains taxcut, which for two years Sen. Mitchell has been instrumentalin defeating on the argument that it benefits the wealthydisproportionately.   Though other congressional leaders remain cool, all sidesare eyeing the issue. Under current law, employer andemployee each pays a 7.65% tax on wages -- 6.2% for SocialSecurity and 1.45% on Medicare. Sens. Moynihan and Kastenpropose to reduce the Social Security tax gradually to 5.2%in 1996, while raising the maximum wages subject to the taxto $82,200 a year from the present $53,400. Another proposal,from Rep. Tom DeLay (R., Texas) and Sen. Malcolm Wallop (R.,Wyo.), pairs a similar payroll-tax reduction with a lower taxrate on capital gains.   House Democratic leaders, who knew in advance of Sen.Mitchell's plans to bless the tax-cut proposal, have declinedto join with him. But they are studying options that combinea reduced payroll tax with a larger taxable wage base, in away that raises taxes on upper-income workers enough tooffset the tax break for lower-income and middle-incometaxpayers. An acceptable formula would allow Democrats toduck Mr. Bush's claim that proponents of the tax cut weretrying to &quot;mess around with Social Security,&quot; one said.   The trouble is, Democrats fear that any tax cut isn'tlikely to be great enough to get wide notice amonglower-income and middle-income taxpayers, while upper-incomeAmericans would object to their increased taxes. HouseMajority Leader Richard Gephardt (D., Mo.), who haspresidential ambitions, leans toward the tax cut, but SpeakerThomas Foley (D., Wash.) and House Ways and Means CommitteeChairman Dan Rostenkowski (D., Ill.) are opposed.   Except for Sen. Mitchell, other Senate leaders also remaincool.   &quot;I'm sympathetic to the idea of middle-income tax relief,but we can't do something like this without first making sureit won't harm the Social Security system,&quot; said Sen. LloydBentsen (D., Texas), chairman of the tax-writing FinanceCommittee. &quot;And second, I don't know how we pay for apayroll-tax cut of any magnitude.&quot;   Senate Republican Leader Robert Dole of Kansas, who hasbeen under pressure from some GOP conservatives to back thetax cut, said, &quot;We're looking at it.&quot; But he clearly remainsskeptical, and said of Sen. Mitchell, &quot;I don't think he knowshow to pay for it.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
