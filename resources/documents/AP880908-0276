Yanosuke Narazaki, of the opposition United Social DemocraticParty, filed the complaint with the Tokyo District PublicProsecutor's Office against the current and past officials ofRecruit Co. and its subsidiary, Rescuit-Cosmos Co., a real estatefirm at the center of an insider-trading scandal, a spokeswoman forthe lawmaker said.   According to Narazaki, one of the men, Hiroshi Matsubara, then atop aide to Recruit's president, brought him the equivalent of$37,000 in cash on Aug. 4, one day before the lawmaker was to takepart in the questioning of government officials about the insidertrading scandal.   Narazaki said he declined the money.   Recruit officials have maintained that Matsubara was actingindependently, but the lawmaker told reporters Thursday he believedthe alleged bribery attempt was carried out on behalf of Recruit.Narazaki claims a contact number left by Matsubara was that of thecompany, Kyodo News Service reported.   The two other officials named in the complaint were formerRecruit-Cosmos Chairman Hiromasa Ezoe and Recruit-Cosmos PresidentTomoyuki Ikeda, the lawmaker's secretary Aya Narazaki said.   In a statement, Recruit said it was unaware of the contents ofthe complaint, but would ``cope with the situation with a cautiousand sincere attitude.'' Company officials declined to discuss thecase further.   The insider trading scandal surfaced in July when it wasrevealed that aides to top politicians bought Rescruit-Cosmos stockin 1984 at bargain prices before it was put on the market, and thenmade hefty profits when prices soared after the stocks wereofficially traded.   Those who profited reportedly included aides to Prime MinisterNoboru Takeshita, Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa and other topfigures in the ruling Liberal Democratic party, as well as seniorbusiness and news media figures.</TEXT></DOC>
