Inside, a grinning Charles A. Corry,the company's chief executive officer, poses in front of ahuge tanker truck at an Ohio truck stop. At first glance, areader would never guess that USX is the nation's largeststeelmaker. And that is probably what Mr. Corry had in mind.He wants shareholders to see rich oil fields in the North Seawhen they think of USX, not hulking steel plants.   But convincing the world that energy is USX's mainstay islike arguing that the Queen Mary is a spaceship. The steeloperations, the nation's largest, are enshrined in a 62story, steel-framed office in Pittsburgh, home of theSteelers football team and Iron City beer. USX's MarathonOil, while growing and profitable, isn't even among thenation's 10 largest energy businesses and is dwarfed by Mobiland Exxon.</LP><TEXT>   Overhauling a century-old corporate image is a dauntingtask even for the unflappable Mr. Corry. He has managed towin one proxy fight and dodge a second with Carl Icahn, whilesimultaneously negotiating a three-year labor contract withthe United Steelworkers of America -- all within the lastyear.   But the image business may be trickier for an executivewho prefers sitting behind a desk to standing behind apodium. The reserved tax attorney is uncomfortable in therole of slick salesman. &quot;He's not dynamic, and he'd never beaccused of being a riverboat gambler,&quot; says a former USXexecutive. &quot;That's good except if there's a story to be toldhe needs to tell it, and so far he's not doing that.&quot;   Shareholders next month will be asked to approve a plan toseparate USX stock into two separate issues -- steel andenergy. The proxy material, filed in February and expected tobe mailed this week, presents details of two separateoperations -- U.S. Steel and Marathon Group -- givingshareholders a so-called &quot;pure&quot; investment. Mr. Corrybelieves the move can only enhance the price of USX's poorlyperforming stock. &quot;As the story gets told and a lot ofinformation&quot; is released, he says, &quot;we ought to get a hell ofa positive reaction in the market.&quot;   The 59-year-old Mr. Corry, who grew up in conservativeCincinnati and has spent his entire career at USX, rarelygets angry or pounds the table. But he does get frustrated.Marathon's gasoline sales are up 5%, the company added twiceas many reserves as it produced, and it has quietly doubledthe number of its profitable convenience stores, while otherchains have gone bankrupt. &quot;We haven't gotten credit in themarket,&quot; he says.   Few investors or the general public, for instance, realizethat Marathon's 1990 operating earnings exceeded those of theentire steel industry. And in Washington, most people thinkthe nondescriptive USX is a U.S. agency.   &quot;USX has an identity crisis of sorts,&quot; says Fred Leuffer,a veteran oil analyst with C.J. Lawrence.   In the past, whenever Mr. Corry approached investors oranalysts with good news about Marathon, they were moreinterested in knowing why steel prices were weak and retireemedical benefits high. &quot;The marketing task before him is toconvince people these are two viable stand-alone businesses,&quot;says Mr. Leuffer. Investors aren't convinced energy won'tshoulder steel's expensive medical liabilities or capitalimprovements, and they're still miffed about thestock-diluting acquisition of Texas Oil andamp; Gas in 1986. WhenMr. Leuffer recently mentioned USX at a lunch, someone threwa roll at him.   Robert DeVeer, an investment banker with First Boston,believes Mr. Corry has already proven himself a savvysalesman, having persuaded shareholders last year to votewith his relatively new management and against veteranwarrior Mr. Icahn. &quot;I'm hard pressed to find one of ourclients who has spent more time telling his story,&quot; says Mr.DeVeer. &quot;He must have talked to 200 to 300 institutionalinvestors over the last couple years.&quot;   Not only must Mr. Corry be a salesman, he must be apolitician, keeping his own employees happy and motivated.Any form of a spin-off creates uncertainty, says John Pound,a finance professor at Harvard's Kennedy School of Governmentwho helped organize a USX shareholder enhancement committee.&quot;It's like cutting an umbilical cord,&quot; he says.   It could be even more distressing for steel operationemployees. Mr. Corry, who has never worked in a steel milland helped to orchestrate the company's foray into energy,has made no secret of his intent to sell the steel side ofthe business.   Mr. Pound says Mr. Corry must move quickly to convince hisown management that the stock split is an opportunity. Oneadvantage he can point to: Managers will be free to raisetheir own money and plan investments, without fighting otheroperations for a limited pool of cash. &quot;The worst thing wouldbe to pretend things are different without really changinganything,&quot; he says. &quot;That would send a confusing set ofsignals.&quot;   Colleagues say the ever-cool Mr. Corry is well suited formaintaining order. He releases tension playing tennis, notverbally hammering managers. &quot;He's unflappable, which I thinkis great for people working for him,&quot; says an executive.&quot;People aren't running off half-cocked.&quot;   Moreover, he doesn't meddle, which will be even moreimportant to managers trying to run separate operations.While the bottom-line oriented chief executive encouragesMarathon executives to sell off costly and less productivereserves, the energy unit remains largely autonomous. &quot;That'swhy it's been a successful marriage,&quot; says Rex Cooley, asenior vice president.   Mr. Corry has even won the grudging respect of his formernemesis, Mr. Icahn. &quot;I respect what he says, and I believethat he will accomplish what he says he wants to do and sellsteel,&quot; Mr. Icahn says. &quot;He's got his shot now, and I thinkhe's going to take it.&quot;   ---                  USX: It's Not Just Steel                                                                                                                               1990 Sales                                                                                                        Energy                                        71% Steel                                         26% Diversified Businesses                         3%</TEXT></DOC>
