Two years later, the stateenacted a beach-protection law that blocked construction onMr. Lucas's land. Does South Carolina have to pay him thelost value of his land?   The Supreme Court will answer that question when itdecides the Lucas case, one in a series of &quot;economic rights&quot;disputes the justices have agreed to hear in coming months.The cases give the court an unusual opportunity to expandproperty rights at the expense of government's power toregulate the environment, industry and the housing market.</LP><TEXT>   Not since the 1930s has the Supreme Court used theConstitution aggressively to curtail government authority toset economic policy. The justices, to be sure, could resolvethe pending cases on narrow grounds, limiting theirsignificance. But the court's willingness to reach out andaccept cases that many expected it to refuse to hear is initself a tip-off that something big could be in the works.   If there is a charge to the defense of economic rights,lawyers expect that it will be led by Justice Antonin Scalia,with the court's newest member, Clarence Thomas, right behindhim. Justice Thomas &quot;has very strong views in the area andthinks that a lot of what the court has done since the NewDeal is wrong,&quot; says Clint Bolick, a conservative activistand former Thomas aide.   &quot;By the end of this term, we may be witnessing therebirth&quot; of constitutionally protected economic rights,asserts Jerold Kayden, a senior fellow at the LincolnInstitute of Land Policy in Cambridge, Mass., and a formerlaw clerk to retired Justice William Brennan. &quot;The court,&quot;Mr. Kayden adds, &quot;is going really nuts on this.&quot;   In addition to the Lucas case, the justices will consider:   -- A challenge by mobile-home-park owners in Escondido,Calif., to a local rent-control ordinance.   -- A development company's claim that denial of a buildingpermit by authorities in Puerto Rico deprived it ofconstitutionally guaranteed civil rights.   -- An attack by General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co. onMichigan worker-benefits legislation that retroactivelyincreased employers' obligations. The car makers contend thatlawmakers have violated the constitutional right to makecontracts.   Proponents of an economic-rights revival, who during the1980s gained attention in academic circles and in parts ofthe Reagan administration, are eagerly anticipatingvindication from the Supreme Court. &quot;While the court ismoving back on the privacy rights and criminal rights createdin the 1960s and 1970s, it is about to rediscover and restoreeconomic rights that liberals read out of the Constitution,&quot;says Mr. Bolick, who recently launched the Institute forJustice, a Washington, D.C., group dedicated to pushingeconomic rights in the courts.   Much of the debate in this area revolves around a part ofthe Fifth Amendment known to lawyers as the Takings Clause.It states that private property shall not be taken for publicuse &quot;without just compensation.&quot;   This provision obviously applies when a state puts a newhighway through someone's front yard and has to compensatethe homeowner for the loss. The more difficult question iswhether state regulation that restricts use of privateproperty requires &quot;just compensation.&quot; Put another way,should it be the state or the affected property owner thatpays the cost of government protection of the common good?   Liberals fear that the high court increasingly will stickgovernment with the bill, or even strike down regulationsaltogether. Sen. Joseph Biden (D., Del.) warned at the outsetof Justice Thomas's confirmation hearings of a possiblereturn to the constitutional theory the Supreme Courtdeployed in the early 1900s to invalidate laws limiting childlabor, creating a minimum wage and requiring safe workingconditions.   Although the court isn't likely to go that far, Mr. Bidenhas reason to fret. Forgotten in the furor oversexual-harassment charges against Justice Thomas were hiscomments as a Reagan administration official praising thenotion of an activist Supreme Court that would strike downlaws regulating economic rights.   Justice Scalia, considered by many to be the court's mostforceful intellect, has made property rights a pet project,according to lawyers who know him. He exerts influence notonly in his published opinions, but also in vigorouslywritten private memoranda that &quot;get people thinking&quot; in otherchambers -- particularly those of Chief Justice WilliamRehnquist and Justices Anthony Kennedy and Sandra O'Connor --say lawyers familiar with the high court's workings.   Property-rights enthusiasts see the Lucas case as theirbest chance for a breakthrough. Mr. Lucas, a wealthy builder,bought two beach-front lots in a heavily developed part ofthe South Carolina coast on which he planned to build twohouses, one for his family and one to sell. When the statepassed its coastline-preservation law two years later, Mr.Lucas didn't dispute the government's good intentions. Hesimply sued the state to get &quot;just compensation&quot; for the lossin value of his land.   A state court awarded him $1.2 million for the &quot;regulatorytaking&quot; of his property. The South Carolina Supreme Courtreversed that decision, declaring that a regulation &quot;enactedto prevent serious public harm&quot; doesn't obligate a state tocompensate land owners, regardless of the extent of theirlosses. The state's Legislature said it had stopped coastlineconstruction to prevent erosion, floods, harm to wildlife andsullying of &quot;a natural health environment&quot; that attractstourist dollars and benefits residents.   In his appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court, Mr. Lucas invokedthe high court's declaration in a 1980 case that land-useregulation results in a taking if it &quot;denies an ownereconomically viable use of his land.&quot; Justice Scalia embracedthat assertion in a decision in 1987, in which he concludedthat California would have to pay owners of beach-frontproperty for a state-mandated easement to allow other peopleto walk across their land to get to the water.   Mr. Lucas, a towering former University of South Carolinafootball player who spent his college summers working as agame warden in Alaska, says he likes &quot;open spaces as much asthe next guy.&quot; But his lots are on a stretch of beach packedwith houses put up before the 1988 law. &quot;There's one oneither side of my lots and one between my lots,&quot; he pointsout. &quot;If they want to take away my {right to build} withoutpaying, that's just plain theft.&quot;   The Escondido rent-control case allows the high court toconsider a more esoteric challenge to government regulation.Voters in the Southern California city passed an initiativein 1988 that prevents owners of mobile-home parks fromincreasing rent for space on their land without cityapproval, even when current tenants sell theirhomes-on-wheels to new occupants.   The park owners say the rent cap has made mobile-homeliving more attractive, allowing current tenants to sell at apremium. That premium -- reflecting the right to occupy atreduced rent -- is the &quot;property&quot; Escondido has taken (andthen given to current tenants), claim the park owners. Theywant $40 million from the city.</TEXT></DOC>
