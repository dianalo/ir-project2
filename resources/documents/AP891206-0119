The 219-1 vote was shy of the 228 needed for the two-thirdsmajority, but 84 deputies were absent and 30 abstained. Theparliament will vote again on the issue Thursday, said EduardasPotashinskas, an activist who watched a live television feed of thesession in the Lithuanian capital of Vilnius.   Also on Wednesday, the Armenian legislature failed to draw aquorum large enough to consider a similar constitutional change,said activist Karen Shakhbazyan in Yerevan.   In Moscow, green photocopied cards appeared Wednesday in subwaystations and main streets calling for a two-hour general strikeMonday to ask the Congress of People's Deputies to rescind the sameprovision in the national constitution.   Human rights activist Andrei D. Sakharov and five fellow membersof the Soviet legislature signed the appeal.   Article 6, which became part of the basic law of the SovietUnion with the Constitution drawn up by Leonid I. Brezhnev in 1977,makes the Communist Party the ``leading and guiding force of Sovietsociety.'' Eliminating it would help reduce the party's grip on onall spheres of life.   Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Poland and Hungary recentlydropped similar provisions in their constitutions granting specialstatus to their Communist parties.   ``Democracy is impossible with the kind of government with aconstitution, that sets the inequality of parties, and theinequality of people who are their members,'' Lithuanian deputyAlbertas Laurinchukas told his fellow deputies, according toPotashinskas.   Sakharov and his fellow deputies are calling for the generalstrike Monday to pressure the national Congress into rescindingArticle 6 and voting on draft laws on land, property and businessenterprises. Congress starts its second semiannual session Tuesday.   The government newspaper Izvestia refused to publish thedeputies' call for the general strike, said Sakharov's wife, YelenaBonner.   ``It is of great importance that Article 6 of the Constitutionbe abandoned,'' Sakharov was quoted as saying by the Soviet newsbulletin Interfax. ``We cannot afford to bob in the wake of changesthat are taking place in Eastern Europe.''   In Czechoslovakia, the parliamentary action was preceded by asimilar symbolic strike. Czechoslovak strike organizers publicizedtheir plan through massive demonstrations, wall posters, and directorganizing at factories.   There has been little publicity in the Soviet Union onSakharov's suggestion thus far, so the Izvestia publication wouldhave been invaluable.   Still, Bonner said, ``The whole country already knows about thisappeal.''   She said documents calling for the strike were distributed at aconference in Moscow on Dec. 2 attended by representatives ofVoters' Clubs from 60 cities around the Soviet Union. The appealalso was announced at the conference of Russia's Front, she said.   Shakhbazyan said he had seen no publicity on Sakharov's strikecall in Yerevan, located 1,100 miles south of Moscow.   Sakharov was quoted by Interfax as saying that dropping theprovision from the Soviet Constitution ``is extremely important inchecking the crisis of confidence in the country.''   He said that if the laws on property, land and businessenterprises are not considered at this session of the Congress,they cannot be approved until the next session, six months away. Atthe least, he said, the constitutional provisions standing in theway of certain reforms should be changed.   The Supreme Soviet working legislature is supposed to hammer outnew laws, but its parent body, the larger Congress, must approveany changes in the Constitution. The Congress meets just twice ayear.   The Supreme Soviet voted last month to place consideration ofArticle 6 on the congressional agenda, but the proposal failed by anarrow margin.   The Congress is the centerpiece of President Mikhail S.Gorbachev's political reforms. Its 2,250 deputies were elected inMarch in the country's first competitive elections in more than 70years.</TEXT></DOC>
