That's Henry's attitude.andP;  Dell has multi-processors internally, hesays, but has never shipped them, nor is it likely to.andP;  Our high-end productsare high-powered servers, he explains, and we rate the disk array technologyas being more important to users here than multiple processors.andP;  The onlysoftware that benefits from multi-processors, he says, is Santa CruzOperation Inc's Unix V.3.2 and Banyan Systems Inc's Vines software - NovellInc doesn't have multiprocessing software yet, nor is likely to have for sometime.andP;  Again, Dell is waiting for others to work at bringing out thenecessary applications software before it will commit itself to supportingthe technology.andP;  Then, and only then, will Dell consider doing amulti-processor card.andP;  So does Dell really believe in Unix? Well, Henryclaims that Dell is selective about its Unix business.andP;  The company beganshipping its own implementation of Unix System V.4 a year ago, followingcustomer demand but, according to Henry, Dell isn't interested inevangelising to new potential Unix users.andP;  Basically, Henry concedes, beingIBM's neighbour down in Austin provided the opportunity, or necessitated thechallenge, to get into Unix development.andP;  Dell's research and developmentspend is comparatively low - the company ploughs under 4% of revenues backinto product development.andP;  - Susan Norris</TEXT></DOC>
