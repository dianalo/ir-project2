Forty more people died in the deluge, bringing the deathtoll to 882, a newspaper reported.   ``Shortage of medicine, cooked food and drinking water iscausing untold miseries to millions of marooned people,'' said anofficial at the Relief Ministry in Dhaka.   Rains battered Dhaka on Sunday, where an estimated 500,000people have taken shelter from adjoining low-lying areas. Theirpresence and uncertainities over the floods caused prices of goodsto rise in the city. Prices for rice, a staple, have risen 40percent.   The capital remained cut off for the third day Sunday as moreareas of the runways at the international airport were submerged.   Relief officials were unable to reach many interior areas wherepeople were feared trapped with meager or no food and potablewater, officials from four areas told The Associated Press bytelephone. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity.   They estimated that 20 million people were marooned in 50 of thecountry's 64 districts that were battered by the floods.   The government issued new appeals for boats, helicopters and 3million tons of food to combat the deluge.   The Sangbad newspaper said 40 people died across the country onSaturday, taking the total death toll in the current monsson floodsthat began in June to at least 882. The government toll, consideredunderstated, stood at 300.   In Dhaka, several gas stations closed their pumps and hung ``NoGas'' signs.   ``Unless to get fresh supplies the pumps will remain closed,''said one station owner, Giasuddin Ahmed.   Annual floods are common in Bangladesh, one of the poorestcountries in the world. At least 1,500 people died in floods lastyear. In 1985, more than 10,000 people were killed when cyclonesand tidal waves hit low islands in the Bay of Bengal, about 130miles south of Dhaka.</TEXT></DOC>
