White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Friday there would beonly ``relatively minor changes'' from the stand the Reaganadministration took at the bargaining table in Geneva beforenegotiations were suspended seven months ago.   ``The previous administration left an excellent foundation onwhich to build,'' Fitzwater said.   Bush convened a meeting of the National Security Council onThursday before formulating instructions to Richard Burt and HenryCooper, who head the U.S. delegation for the strategic armsreduction and space-defense talks.   Among the items the president took up with his key advisers waswhether to shift the U.S. position on mobile missiles.   The chairmen of the Senate and House Armed Services committees,Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., and Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., wanted to push fora ban on mobiles with multiple warheads.   The U.S. position in the talks last year was that all mobilemissiles should be outlawed until ways are found to keep track ofthem and make sure any negotiated reductions are carried out.   Fitzwater said that remained the U.S. position in thenegotiations with the Soviets. But he stressed that on mobilemissiles and other weapons questions, ``we do reserve the right toreview these matters and make changes on an ongoing basis.''   Overall, the spokesman said, `'there will be a considerabledegree of continuity in the approach of this administration.''   While the talks formally reopen on Monday, negotiations do notbegin until Wednesday. That leaves time for Bush to make changes inthe instructions he gave to Burt and Cooper.   But a U.S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said hedid not expect the president to revise the U.S. position in the daysahead.   The talks are aimed at reducing U.S. and Soviet long-rangebombers, land-based missiles and nuclear submarines by 30 percent to50 percent.   Earlier, a senior administration official also said the Bush teamis taking an optimistic view about the Kremlin's approach to thenegotiations.   The official said the Soviets ``have indicated in their rhetoric... they are eager to get back to talks and that they have apositive attitude. We'll see.''   When the negotiations were suspended last November, about 90percent of the work was completed. The talks have been on hold eversince as Bush took office and ordered a review of U.S. policy onnational security issues.   The unfinished 10 percent of the agreement contains some of thethorniest issues, such as weapons ceilings, limits on air- andsea-launched cruise missiles, verification, and how to deal withmobile missiles.   A senior Pentagon official told reporters that U.S. negotiatorswould seek to turn the talks immediately to verification issues.   ``Intead of treating verification as the caboose on the train,and treating it at the end or after the end, during ratificationdebates, I think that we will probably see an effort to bring thatto a higher priority and get serious movement going on things thatcould substantially advance our ability to verify this agreementwhen it is done,'' said the official, speaking on condition that henot be further identified.   The Intermediate Nuclear Force Treaty, ratified by the Senatelast year, drew complaints from some senators that it would be hardto verify, although it allows unprecedented on-site inspection ofSoviet and U.S. military sites.   Of particular concern under the proposed START treaty, said theofficial, was the ability of the United States to verify the numberof Soviet mobile missiles. The Soviets have fielded two suchsystems, the SS-24 and the SS-25, whereas the United States has notyet developed one.   Bush has asked Congress to provide money for two mobile missiles,a rail-based MX, with 10 warheads, and the so-called Midgetman, withone or two warheads.   ``Whether under START it's going to be more desirable to permitmobiles or to continue to seek the ban on them is something that wemay not be able to determine'' until the verification issue issettled, said the official.   When the arms talks resume, parallel talks will begin again onspace-based defenses against ballistic missile attacks.   Both the senior officials who spoke to reporters said Bush ``hasindicated he is not going to make a 90-degree change in direction.''</TEXT></DOC>
