A majority of those who expect another world war believe it willhappen within two decades, the survey found. And if it does recur,most Americans fear it will escalate into an all-out nuclearconflagration.   A majority of respondents to the poll also said one of World WarII's darkest episodes could recur: A holocaust on the order of NaziGermany's murder of more than 6 million Jews.   The 1,163 respondents were asked: ``Do you think that kind ofthing could happen again _ that is, the killing of millions ofpeople because of their religion or ethnic background?'' Six in 10said it could.   More than a million German soldiers invaded Poland on Sept. 1,1939, prodding France and Britain to declare war on Germany a fewdays later. World War II lasted until 1945, claiming the lives of anestimated 50 million people.   The United States joined the war in 1941 after the Japaneseattacked the U.S. Pacific Fleet at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. Four yearslater, the U.S. hastened Japan's surrender by dropping atomic bombson Hiroshima and Nagasaki _ still the only time nuclear weapons havebeen used in war.   Six in 10 poll respondents said the Hiroshima bombing, in whichup to 200,000 people died, was right. Seventy percent of the men inthe survey supported the bombing; half the women agreed.   Two in 10 respondents said they sometimes think of Japan as theenemy because of the war. And with Japan now one of the world'sleading economic powers, nearly four in 10 said the United Statesdid too much to help rebuild Japan after the war.   A smaller group, 24 percent, said the United States did too muchto help rebuild West Germany, which also is one of the world'sstrongest economies today. One in 10 said they sometimes think ofGermany as the enemy.   Respondents strongly supported the reunification of Germany,which was divided after the war into democratic West Germany andcommunist-controlled East Germany. Seventy percent favored the twoGermanies' coming together again as one country.   Overall, nearly 70 percent considered themselves familiar withthe events of World War II. Older people were far more apt to ratethemselves as ``very familiar'' with the war _ 57 percent of thoseolder than age 64 chose that category, compared with just 12 percentof those younger than 45.   Familiarity with one aspect of the war was overwhelming:Ninety-five percent said they had heard of the Holocaust. Age wasnot a factor.   Respondents in the oldest group were less likely to believe therewill be another world war. But they were more likely to expect thatif one did occur, it would escalate into all-out nuclear war.   The expectation of another world war was greater among women (53percent) than among men (44 percent). Women also were more apt thanmen to fear nuclear escalation of a world war, 60-48 percent.   Of the 49 percent who said they expect another world war at somepoint, 6 percent said it was likely within five years, 29 percentwithin 10 years and 26 percent within 20 years. Thus 61 percent ofthis group _ or 30 percent overall _ foresaw World War III withintwo decades.   The poll was conducted by telephone July 7-16 among a randomsample of adults in the continental United States. It has a marginof error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.
