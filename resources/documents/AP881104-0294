DRISCOLL</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><TEXT>   Researchers today tried to trace a ``virus'' that infectedcomputer systems nationwide, slowing machines in universities, aNASA and nuclear weapons lab and other federal research centerslinked by a Defense Department computer network.   By Thursday night, the virus had infected hundreds of computerson what one expert said was the largest scale ever. Authorities saidthe virus apparently destroyed no data but temporarily halted someresearch.   The New York Times reported today that an anonymous caller to thenewspaper claimed that a graduate student had created the virus as aharmless experiment and became terrified of the consequences when itgot out of hand.   Viruses are tiny programs introduced to computers either as aprank or vandalism. They can attach themselves to other programs andspread through shared software or ``electronic mail'' systems thatlink computers.   Mild viruses may flash a message on a user's screen, while``deadly'' forms can destroy data or cripple a computer. This virusapparently did its damage by rapidly duplicating itself, therebyslowing computers' processing speed and taking up their memory space.   Many research centers shut down their computers Thursday in aneffort to purge the rapidly spreading virus, but not all expertswere confident they had eliminated the program, which could lingerin electronic mailboxes. In the past, ``antidote'' programs havebeen developed to seek out and destroy viruses.   ``The very scary thing is that this is a very sophisticatedcomputer program, and shutting them down may not be enough,'' saidRichard LeBlanc, associate professor in Georgia Tech's School ofComputer Sciences.   At Lawrence laboratory in Berkeley, Calif., computer scientistsnoticed their computers operating very slowly Wednesday afternoon.   They turned off the machines, flipped them back on again andwithin 30 seconds the virus was spreading again, said Lynn Yarras, aspokesman at the research center.   The computer problem also was discovered late Wednesday at theLawrence Livermore National Laboratory in Livermore, Calif. Thelaboratory's work includes design of the nation's nuclear weaponsand key work on the Strategic Defense Initiative, or ``Star Wars,''program.   However, spokesman Jeff Garberson said the virus affected theunclassified, non-secured computer systems and not the classifiednational defense system.   At the Los Alamos, N.M., National Laboratory, the virus infectedonly unclassified computers, said spokeswoman Barbara Mulkin.   Computer experts at the lab were analyzing the situation todetermine what damage might have occurred and to find a cure. Ms.Mulkin said that might take a day.   At Stanford University in Palo Alto, Calif., the virus was``mainly just slowing down systems and slowing data,'' said BobBeyers, a school spokesman.   ``The developer was clearly a very high order hacker,'' orcomputer buff, said John McAfee, chairman of the Computer VirusIndustry Association in Santa Clara, Calif.   ``He used a flaw in the operating systems of these computers'' toenter the electronic mail system of ARPANET, a computer networkestablished by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, theresearch arm of the U.S. Defense Department, McAfee said.   ARPANET links nearly every university in the United States,allowing researchers to ``communicate data and text very easily,''said Bob Finn, a spokesman for the California Institute ofTechnology.   The virus also infected a network called Science Internet thatserves many scientists and research labs, including NASA's JetPropulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., said JPL spokesman JimWilson.   Also attacked were computers at Harvard University, BostonUniversity, Purdue University, the University of Wisconsin inMadison, Georgia Tech, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology andother major research centers.   The Times reported today that the anonymous caller to the papersaid his associate was responsible for the attack and had meant itto be harmless. The caller said the hacker was a graduate studentwho made a programming error in designing the virus, causing theprogram to replicate much faster than expected.   The caller said the student realized his error shortly afterletting the program loose and now was terrified of the consequences,the Times said.   The Defense Communications Agency set up an emergency center todeal with the virus, the newspaper said. But no known criminalinvestigations were under way.   In September, a former Fort Worth, Texas, programmer wasconvicted of planting a virus in his employer's computer system inthe first such conviction in the nation. Two days after the employeewas fired, the virus activated, erasing 168,000 company records.   Charley Kline, senior research programer at the University ofIllinois, said Thursday's virus traveled between computer systemsthrough a process in which computer operators usually sendelectronic mail to each other.   He said once the messages were received, their coding told thecomputer to make copies of the virus. The copies then sought outother connected computers, he said.   ``This is the first time that I know of that it has happened onthis scale to larger systems,'' said Kline.   Whether the virus ultimately would have destroyed computer datawon't be known until its program is more thoroughly studied, McAfeesaid.   In 1986 and 1987, two brothers in Pakistan who sold inexpensivecopies of computer software let loose a virus known as the PakistaniBrain through surreptitious coding in the software.   ``It eventually was found in every country in the world, everystate in the union, every university computer,'' McAfee said.   At Boston University, Associate Provost John Porter calledcomputer viruses ``electronic vandalism.''   ``It's childish and infantile, done with no knowledge of theresults,'' Porter said.</TEXT></DOC>
