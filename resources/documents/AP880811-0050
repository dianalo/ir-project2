Koch.   On Wednesday night, about 500 demonstrators chanting anti-policeslogans marched on a Manhattan precinct house, some of thempainting swastikas on squad cars, to protest police actions inSunday's riot.   The marchers, led by New York Civil Liberties Union directorNorman Siegel, chanted ``the park belongs to the people'' as theywere met by two dozen police officers behind barricades. There wasno violence.   An effort by police to enforce a 1 a.m. curfew at TompkinsSquare Park last Sunday led to a protest that degenerated into aclash between hundreds of officers with nightsticks and rock- andbottle-throwing protesters. At least 52 people were injured,including 14 officers. Enforcement of the curfew was suspendedMonday.   Civilians accused the police of indiscriminately beatingprotesters and bystanders. By late Wednesday, 73 complaints ofpolice brutality had been filed.   Also Wednesday, a 29-year-old man filed a $50 million lawsuitagainst the city, saying police attacked him with ``stormtroopersavagery'' after he stumbled into the riot while trying to hail acab.   In papers filed in state court, Kenneth Fish said aclub-swinging officer opened a gash that required 44 stitches.   Early today, one man was killed and another injured in anapparently drug-related shooting near the park, police said. Thecurfew, which has been lifted, had been enforced after neighborhoodresidents complained the park had become a noisy and unsafegathering place for drug dealers and derelicts.   Ward said the preliminary report on the riot ``seems to me toshow a number of shortcomings and to answer some questions, but toraise a number of other questions as well.''   Among the questions, he said, were whether unnecessary force wasused; whether supervisors lost control of their personnel; andwhether motorists were trapped in cars, prompting a prematurecharge by mounted police.   ``I will require and demand answers to these still unansweredquestions as to whether or not we acted in our normal operatingprocedures,'' he said.   The report by Chief of Department Robert J. Johnston Jr. saidthe temporary police headquarters should not have been set up inthe park and reserves should have been mobilized outside the area.   Ward said officers moved against the protesters as quickly asthey did after receiving unconfirmed reports of people trapped incars on a street by the park, some of them screaming women and somegetting beaten by demonstrators.   However, he added that he did not have the identity of anytrapped person, or any reports on anyone who was aided.   He also said it appeared the ranking officer at the scene leftto return to the police station 12 blocks away to go to thebathroom at ``a very crucial time at the beginning of thisdemonstration.''   While the commander was absent, he was not replaced permanentlyat the scene by another high-ranking officer who could coordinatethe assignment of the hundreds of police officers who responded tobackup calls.</TEXT></DOC>
