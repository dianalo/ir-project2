Taking over the management of an institution is not a simple matter of cost and efficiency. It raises substantial policy and legal concerns.    It may be inappropriate, for example, to operate prisons with a profit motive -- which provides no incentive to reduce overcrowding (especially if the company is paid on a per-prisoner basis or its staff is given stock options), to consider alternatives to incarceration, or to deal with broader problems of criminal justice.    Cost-cutting may run rampant at the expense of humane treatment. In the words of one private-company official: &quot;We'll hopefully make a buck at it. I'm not going to kid any of you and say that we are in this for humanitarian reasons.&quot; Questions regarding people's liberty should not be contracted out to the lowest bidder.    Further, some of the financing arrangements for constructing private facilities may unfairly eliminate the public from the decision making. Traditionally, corrections facilities have been financed through tax-exempt general-obligation bonds that require voter approval. Privatization provides an end-run around the taxpayers when the company builds the institution and leases it to the government. The cost then comes out of the government's regular appropriation, avoiding the politically difficult step of raising debt ceilings.    One example of the potentially egregious effects of reducing accountability and regulation is a proposal by a private firm in Pennsylvania to build an interstate protective-custody facility on a toxic-waste site, which it had purchased for $1.    Many difficult legal questions (including standards implementations, use of force, strikes and bankruptcy) can, of course, be answered in a meticulously drafted contract. State and federal constitutional problems, however, cannot easily be contracted away. Privatization would not minimize the state-action liability of governmental entities under the Civil Rights Act, pursuant to which most prison-conditions litigation is brought. Indeed, by delegating the incarceration function a state's liability may actually increase, since the state may effectively be waiving the defense of sovereign immunity in ordinary-negligence actions.    A more extensive question -- which will provide the major legal challenge to privatization -- is whether delegation would be unconstitutional, for not all governmental functions can be delegated. Just as privatizing the criminal courts would likely violate the Constitution, so too might the privatization of incarceration.    While some public services -- such as firefighting and waste management -- have gone private in a few jurisdictions, running a prison is different: It is not only the provision of a service, it is also the doing of justice. Even if constitutional, therefore, privatizing prisons may be utterly unwise. Symbolically, it may weaken the integrity of the criminal-justice system when an inmate looks at his keeper's uniform and, instead of encountering an emblem that reads &quot;State Department of Corrections,&quot; he faces one that says &quot;Acme Corrections Co.&quot; I wonder what Dostoevski -- who wrote that &quot;{t}he degree of civilization in a society can be judged by entering its prisons&quot; -- would have thought about privatization.
