The paper then describes typical salt well construction andmodes pf operation, rates of production, and applicability to beddedand domed salt structures. This mechanism of solutioning is discussed,along with recent rsearch on cavern stability and modelling studies.A summary outlines some of the present and possible future utilizationsof caverns created by solution mining. The most significant uses of suchcaverns in the USA are for gas and crude oil storage. Salt caverns offersuch advantages as large existing capacity, low surface land requirements,safety and stability of storage, low costs, and (for gas) high withdrawalrate capability. 16 figs., 3 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
