The bank also will report a profit of $25 million to $26million, or 20 to 21 cents a share fully diluted, for thefirst quarter, said John W. Flynn, Fleet's vice chairman andchief financial officer. In the first quarter of 1990, Fleethad a loss of $98 million, or 92 cents a share.</LP><TEXT>   In a registration statement filed with the Securities andExchange Commission, Fleet, based in Providence, R.I., saidit plans to offer 8.75 million shares -- which would bring inabout $140 million at the current stock price. In compositetrading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, Fleet'sstock closed at $16 a share, down 25 cents a share.   The company, which has 111.3 million shares outstanding,said the funds will be used for general corporate purposesand possibly the acquisition of failed financial institutionsfrom government agencies.   &quot;The bank market is very receptive to capital plays, ifproperly pitched,&quot; said Gerard Cassidy, an analyst withTucker Anthony Inc. &quot;Fleet is clearly going to use that moneyfor acquisitions and they need to stress that in marketingthe issue, to show investors that their money will be used tobuy failed banks at good prices.&quot;   The bank, bidding jointly with the leverage buy-out firmof Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts andamp; Co., has offered to buy Bankof New England from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. InFebruary, Fleet was paid $19 million by the FDIC to take overMaine Savings Bank, which had $1.3 billion in assets.   With the sluggish New England economy hurting the bank'sloan portfolio, especially its regional real estate loans,earnings are increasingly being driven by Fleet's robustfee-based businesses. Breaking down the bank's net income forthe quarter, Mr. Flynn said the financial services group --which includes Fleet's mortgage banking, student loanprocessing and leasing businesses -- earned $35 million, a50% increase from the year-ago quarter. Fleet's New Yorkbanking group earned about $20 million, up from $5 million inthe year-earlier quarter.   The New England banking group lost $10 million to $12million, compared with a loss of $115 million. Other losses,which Mr. Flynn wouldn't specify, came from costs incurred bythe parent company, ostensibly expenses related to Fleet'sbid for Bank of New England.   &quot;We've had the same strategy for 20 years: functional andgeographic diversification,&quot; said Mr. Flynn about thequarterly profit, which came after a loss of $48.9 million in1990's fourth quarter. &quot;That strategy has served us well inthis economic cycle.&quot;   The bank's nonperforming assets rose slightly, Mr. Flynnsaid, to $1.45 billion from the year-end total of $1.38billion. Most of that rise, he noted, was in Fleet's New Yorkbanks, while Fleet's New England banks contributed only about$10 million to the rise. The bank added about $25 million toloan loss reserves -- bringing the total reserve to $725million. In the year-earlier quarter, the bank had $595million in loan loss reserves.   Fleet's return on assets will be about 0.35% for the firstquarter and its return on equity will be about 5%, said Mr.Flynn, who noted that shareholders' equity will have risenabout $50 million in the quarter to $2.1 billion.   The bank, with $32.5 billion in assets, made several movesto improve liquidity in the quarter, including borrowing $110million from private investors and entering a one-yearrevolving loan facility with a group of domestic andinternational banks for $550 million, he said.</TEXT></DOC>
