RoschandM;The cost of color is plummeting, and so is the price of thermal wax transferprinters.andP;  In less than two years, the cost of a PostScript-compatible colorthermal printer has fallen by more than half.andP;  With new designs crowding intothe market, prices are going in only one direction -- further down.andM;Behind these bargains lies a mixture of technical innovations and designrefinements that have helped printer manufacturers keep pace with theincreasing competition.andP;  For example, a number of these factors have combinedto enable QMS Inc., a manufacturer of PostScript-compatible printers, toslice the price of one thermal wax model by more than 35 percent since itsintroduction.andM;&quot;QMS introduced the first color PostScript printer in May of 1988 at a listprice of about $25,000,&quot; said Terry Harbin, manager of electronic publishingsystems at QMS in Mobile, Ala.andP;  &quot;Subsequently, because of falling DRAMprices, design improvements and market acceptance, we're now down to acurrent price of $15,995 for our ColorScript Model 30.&quot;andM;New, more technically advanced models have pushed prices further down.andP;  Abouteight months ago, QMS introduced a PostScript-compatible color printer, theModel 10, for $9,995.andM;Getting prices to that level was a challenge, but it was aided byimprovements in print engines and controllers, Harbin explained.andM;Hardware RefinementsandM;The print engine is the mechanical part of the printer that actually puts inkon paper.andP;  In a thermal wax printer, the engine transfers wax-based ink froma plastic film-based carrier onto special paper.andP;  Heat is generated to meltthe wax to allow the ink to flow.andM;The controller is the circuitry that translates computer-generatedinstructions, such as PostScript code, into the dot pattern the printer willtransfer to paper.andP;  In effect, it combines a raster-image processor with thelogic circuitry necessary to coordinate the functions of the engine.andM;New thermal wax printers are benefiting from improvements in both the engineand the controller.andP;  For example, the maturing of engine technology has ledto the design of smaller, more compact assemblies.andP;  Printer manufacturerstaking advantage of these advanced engines can make more affordable printerswithout compromising quality.andM;&quot;To get the price down, we're using a completely new print engine fromMitsubishi,&quot; said Harbin.andP;  &quot;The introduction of the G370 engine by Mitsubishilowered our costs and let us get a color product to the user at lower cost.&quot;andM;Key to making the new engine less expensive are a design change and a smallersize.andM;&quot;There are substantial changes in the engine,&quot; said Harbin.andP;  &quot;In particular,the print head is reduced to only 8.5 inches wide where it was 11 inches widein the earlier engines.andP;  There are cost savings there.&quot;andM;The smaller engine has a drawback, however.andP;  &quot;Our original machine used aMitsubishi G650 engine, which supported page formats up to 11 by 17 inches.andO;Our Model 10 is limited to pages measuring 8.5 by 14 inches,&quot; explainedHarbin.andM;Not only does a smaller page mean that a smaller, less expensive engine isrequired, it also means there is less data per page.andP;  And that, in turn,means a less expensive controller.andM;&quot;The primary consideration is memory,&quot; Harbin said.andP;  &quot;When doing four-colortechnology, you have to bit-map four complete planes of the image.andP;  When youtry to do that on a 11-by-17-inch page, you need about 8M bytes of memory.andO;The Model 10 only needs 4M bytes to handle its smaller page size.&quot;andM;But there's more to making an efficient controller than pulling off RAMchips.andP;  QMS also improved the printer's quality and reliability whilereducing cost.andM;&quot;QMS has designed a controller that uses not only less memory but also fewercomponents,&quot; noted Harbin.andP;  &quot;Fewer components means fewer things to gowrong.&quot;andM;Harbin sees continued price pressure on thermal wax printers.andP;  &quot;I think thatwe can safely assume we will see other printer vendors with competingtechnologies at significantly lower prices drive prices down,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;Isee a proliferation of ink-jet technology.andP;  It's improving all the time.andO;It's inherently lower-cost than thermal technology.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
