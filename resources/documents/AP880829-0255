Matsushita said Monday that a close U.S. business ally hasconcluded a licensing agreement with ATandamp;T and Sun to use theirSparc computer architecture in a new engineering workstation.   The Sparc design is tailored for use with ATandamp;T's latest versionof Unix. Unix is a base layer of software that allows programs torun on a variety of computer models.   The version of Unix developed by ATandamp;T with Sun has beenchallenged by an industry group that says the popular softwareshould not be controlled by one company. That group includes suchpowerhouses as International Business Machines Corp., DigitalEquipment Corp. and Hewlett-Packard Co.   Matsushita's decision to jump into the fast-growing workstationmarket ends an effective 24-year absence from the field ofhigh-powered computers. Workstations are fast computers with stronggraphics capabilities that are typically used by scientists andengineers.   Matsushita said it plans to build the central processing unitfor the workstations designed by Solbourne Computer Inc. ofLongmont, Colo., and Solbourne would supply the rest of theworkstation's components and sell it under its own brand name inthe United States.   Matsushita owns 52 percent of Solbourne, according to MikeKitadeya, a spokesman for Matsushita's U.S. subsidiary.   Solbourne hopes to put a workstation on sale in the UnitedStates early next year, Kitadeya said.   Matsushita's decision to enter the fray over Unix, thoughindirectly for the time being, on the side of Sparc could affectthe opinions of other Japanese electronics makers.</TEXT></DOC>
