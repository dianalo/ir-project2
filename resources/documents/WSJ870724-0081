Putco Ltd.'s blue buses havebeen burned, bombed, slashed and stoned. Some have beenhijacked.   In the past couple of weeks, though, Putco has become a target of something quite different: a takeover. Not a takeover of the sort familiar to Wall Street, but a takeover, apartheid-style.    It has all the standard South African racial ingredients. There are two suitors, one white, one black. There is black anger at the prospect of continuing white domination, and white fear that the blacks will take control. There are charges of racism, and there are anonymous threats. &quot;This deal would be a simple proposition in a normal society,&quot; says James Chapman, one of the participants. &quot;But South Africa isn't a normal society.&quot;    Putco's recent history began in 1971, when Gaetano Carleo, an Italian immigrant, purchased it from British Leyland (since renamed BL PLC). Under him, Putco became the largest bus company in the country, with a fleet of some 4,000 vehicles covering the roads around Johannesburg, Pretoria and Durban.    It also became an unwitting symbol of apartheid, for Putco, with government subsidies, provides the link between the townships and tribal homelands where blacks are forced to live, and the big cities where many of them work. The company is something of a barometer of the black mood: Damage to the buses is a measure of black rage, falling ridership is a sign of black labor unrest.    Then there are the suitors. On one side is the Southern Africa Bus and Taxi Association, or Sabta, a national organization of 45,000 black taxi owners and drivers. It has acquired an option to buy the company, reportedly for 140 million rand, or about $67.6 million, though it has yet to put together the financing. &quot;We're closer to the community,&quot; declares Mr. Chapman, Sabta's national adviser. &quot;In a company like Putco, you need to be open to community vibes.&quot;    But a rival group, a consortium of white businessmen led by taxi-company owner Anthony Mayer, worries about the implications of black control over a business that it labels &quot;strategic&quot; because it transports labor vital to South Africa's economy. It has offered Sabta five million rand for the purchase option and the Carleo family 150 million rand for the company.    Although he denies it now, Mr. Mayer was quoted in the local press as saying, &quot;We feel we cannot allow control of black transport to fall into black hands. They could disrupt the economy of South Africa any time they felt like it.&quot;    Reaction to the remarks was angry. The National African Chambers of Commerce, a black group, says the white businessmen are &quot;kindling a fire they may not be able to extinguish.&quot; Mr. Mayer claims he and his partners have received telephoned threats against their homes and families. He insists he has nothing against blacks in business, he just feels Sabta doesn't have the experience to run a huge company. He makes a comparison to the country's politics: &quot;Even if we believe we can share power with the blacks, we're not going to give them the whole government tomorrow,&quot; he says.    The Carleo family decided to sell its 52.5% stake in Putco early this year. Sabta, through an intermediary, made a bid several weeks ago. Johannesburg market analysts, though, wonder why anybody would be in a rush to buy the company. Last year, it posted an operating loss of about 12 million rand on revenues of 300 million rand. But more ominous than the bottom line is the unending threat of boycotts and violence.    A Putco spokesman rattles off a list of destruction over the past two years: 202 buses hijacked; 66 destroyed and 115 damaged by fire; 15,433 stoned. There's more: 38,840 windows broken, 227 front windshields smashed, 575 tires slashed.    &quot;To buy a company like this, you'd have to be out of your head,&quot; says a Johannesburg broker close to Putco. &quot;Either that, or into politics.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
