The Fed's policy-making group, the Federal Open MarketCommittee, is scheduled to meet today and tomorrow to map outnear-term monetary strategy.</LP><TEXT>   It's widely expected in the markets that the FOMC willauthorize another 1/4 percentage-point cut in the federalfunds rate target. The rate, now at 4.5%, is what bankscharge each other for overnight loans. The Fed has cut thefederal funds rate more than two percentage points so farthis year, the latest reduction of which occurred on Dec. 6.Although the Fed won't release any information regardingpolicy decisions made at the FOMC meeting for several weeks,market participants anticipate a signal of easier policylater this week.   In addition, some analysts believe that the Fed's Board ofGovernors may vote to cut the discount rate 1/2 percentagepoint to 4%. The discount rate is what the Fed charges onovernight loans to member banks.   The bond market's bellwether security, the 30-yearbenchmark Treasury bond, rose more than 1/8 point yesterday,a gain of about $1.25 for a bond with a $1,000 face amount.The issue's yield, which moves in the opposite direction ofits price, eased to 7.75% from 7.77% on Friday.   Bond prices were little changed for most of the day. Butprices of long-term bonds received a mild boost late in theday after it was reported on newswires that Deputy TreasurySecretary John Robson reiterated that the Treasury isconsidering selling fewer 30-year bonds at future auctions.The suggestion recently by Treasury Secretary Nicholas Bradythat the Treasury might reduce the size of its 30-year bondsales helped support what has otherwise been a shunned areaof the Treasury bond market.   Analysts say that the Fed's decisions to ease, or not toease, will likely have a marked impact on this week'sauctions of $13.5 billion two-year notes and $9 billionfive-year Treasury notes. The auctions are scheduled fortomorrow and Thursday, respectively.   In trading yesterday, the when-issued two-year notes werequoted at a yield of 5.07% and the when-issued five-year noteto be sold Thursday was quoted at a yield of 6.26%.   Analysts say those yields are approaching levels thatwould fully price in a 4.25% federal funds rate. If the Feddoesn't ease policy this week, the yields on those issueswill most likely rise.   &quot;People seem to be betting on a discount rate cut as earlyas {today},&quot; says Anthony Karydakis, senior financialeconomist at First Chicago Capital Markets.   Timing may be a critical factor for political purposes,analysts say, because Federal Reserve Board Chairman AlanGreenspan is slated to testify tomorrow morning before theHouse Ways and Means Committee, and he is surely to be askedwhat the Fed is doing to recharge the economy.   Economic data released yesterday had little impact on noteand bond prices, though it lent further weight to theevidence that the economy is faltering in the fourth quarter.   The Fed reported that industrial production declined 0.4%in November, a sharper contraction than the 0.2% declineforecast by a Dow Jones Capital Markets Report.                                                                                                          Treasury Securities                                                                                                          Treasurys ended unchanged to higher in quiet trading.   The benchmark 30-year bond ended modestly higher at aprice of 102 23/32 to yield 7.75% compared with 102 18/32 toyield 7.77% on Friday. The existing two-year notes, however,ended unchanged at a price of 100 26/32 to yield 5.04%.   The Treasury sold $20.52 billion of short-term billsyesterday at its regular weekly auction. The average discountrate on the new three-month bills was 4.14% and was 4.19% forsix-month bills.   The discount rate on three-month bills was the lowestsince the average of 4.06% at the auction on Aug. 21, 1972.The discount rate on six-month bills was the lowest since theaverage of 4.19% at the auction on June 12, 1972.   Here are the details of yesterday's auction by theTreasury of 13-week and 26-week bills:                                                                                                          Rates are determined by the difference between thepurchase price and face value. Thus, higher bidding narrowsthe investor's return while lower bidding widens it. Thepercentage rates are calculated on a 360-day year, while thecoupon-equivalent yield is based on a 366-day year.                                                                                                                                       13-Week          26-Week                                                                                                          Applications ..........  $30,197,545,000  $29,091,735,000   Accepted bids .........  $10,268,885,000  $10,252,940,000   Accepted at low price .              77%              38%   Accepted noncompet'ly .   $1,315,585,000     $933,600,000   Average price (Rate) ..   98.954 (4.14%)   97.882 (4.19%)   High price (Rate) .....   98.959 (4.12%)   97.892 (4.17%)   Low price (Rate) ......   98.954 (4.14%)   97.882 (4.19%)   Coupon equivalent .....            4.25%            4.35%   CUSIP number ..........        912794YE8        912794YT5                                                                                                          Both issues are dated Dec. 19, 1991. The 13-week billsmature March 19, 1992, and the 26-week bills mature June 18,1992.                                                                                                          Corporate andamp; Junk Bonds                                                                                                          The junk bonds of Amstar Corp. jumped on late news thatEssex Industries Inc. has increased its cash tender offer forAmstar's debt.   Essex makes architectural hardware, and Amstar is a makerof portable electric tools. Both are units of Esstar Inc., aholding company that is owned by Merrill Lynch andamp; Co.'sbuy-out funds.   Essex Industries said it has boosted the offer forAmstar's 11.375% senior subordinated notes to $750 from $550for each bond with a $1,000 redemption amount. The offer iscontingent upon Essex having received sufficient financing toenable it to buy $86.6 million of senior subordinated notesand related costs.   At least $86.6 million principal amount of bonds must betendered if the deal is to be completed. Essex Industriessaid it has extended the offer for Amstar notes to Dec. 30.   Even though the news was disseminated after the close oftrading, Amstar's bonds registered significant price gains inactive trading. Its 11.375% senior subordinated notes shot upfive points to 70. Some traders suggested the news was leakedout during the day, accounting for the sharp rise in price.   Meanwhile, in the broader high-yield market, junk bonds,or speculative-grade bonds with low credit ratings or nocredit ratings at all, were unchanged.   Investment-grade corporate bonds ended little changed.Only one high-grade company, Heller Financial Corp., steppedinto the market to offer nonconvertible debt, selling $200million of seven-year notes priced to yield 8.066%. The noteswere sold through underwriters led by Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co.                                                                                                          Municipal Bonds                                                                                                          Municipal bond prices finished as much as 1/4 point higheramid limited trading.   Among seasoned secondary issues, the Florida Board ofEducation's 6.70% issues of 2022 finished 1/4 higher, at 991/2 to yield 6.74%.   Elsewhere, New York City received a boost to itsforthcoming bond sale, as Standard andamp; Poor's Corp. assigned asingle-A-minus rating to $197 million of the city's uninsuredgeneral obligation bonds, part of a $985 million dealexpected tomorrow. Sandamp;P also assigned various ratings to$203.2 million variable rate bonds that will be part of theGO deal.   In new issue activity today, a top yield in the 7.30%range for bonds maturing in 2015 is anticipated on $191.7million of Metropolitan Transportation Authority, New York,commuter facility and service contract revenue bonds.Underwriters led by Bear Stearns andamp; Co. are expected to pricethe bonds sometime during the session.   A top yield in the 7.30% range would compare with a topyield of 7.13% in 2012 for the authority's $415.38 milliondeal sold last month.   A recent deluge of more than $3 billion of supply from NewYork issuers in the last few weeks is cited as the reason forthe higher yields expected on the coming MetroplitanTransportation Authority sale, dealers said.   The rating on the bonds are currently under review byMoody's Investors Service Inc. and Standard andamp; Poor's Corp.The outstanding commuter facility and service contract bondsare rated single-A by Moody's and triple-B-plus by Sandamp;P.                                                                                                          Mortgage andamp; Asset-Backed Securities                                                                                                          Mortgage securities prices ended slightly higher,supported by continued demand from dealers who needcollateral for real estate mortgage investment conduit deals.   Also in yesterday's session, six new Remic deals totaling$2.3 billion were announced.   In secondary trading, Government National MortgageAssociation 8% securities for January delivery were up 5/32at 100 16/32, Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. Gold 8%securities were 7/32 firmer at 100 7/32 and Federal NationalMortgage Association 8% securities were up 7/32 at 100.

Among those issues were Fannie Mae 8.5% issues,Fannie Mae 15-year 8% issues and Freddie Mac five-year 7.5%balloon mortgage securities.   The new securities are seen being absorbed by investorswithout much resistance.</TEXT></DOC>
