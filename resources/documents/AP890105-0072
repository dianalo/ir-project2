DALY</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Police officers stomped on a handcuffed suspect for10 minutes while he lay screaming on the ground, then told him towash his face before booking him, Massachusetts' attorney generalhas charged.   In a civil rights complaint filed Wednesday in Superior Court,Attorney General James Shannon said 13 officers either allowed ortook part in the beating. The man was accused of running a red lightand trying to elude police.   Shannon accused the officers of using excessive force, conspiringto keep the incident quiet and depriving the man of his civil rights.   ``This case is particularly disturbing because of the number ofofficers involved and the failure even to conduct aninvestigation,'' the attorney general said.   The suit asks the court to bar the 13 officers from furtherviolations and prohibit them from handling arrests until they take acourt-approved course in the use of force.   The officers have 30 days to respond to the complaint. They willremain on active duty pending any court action, police said.   Boston Police Commissioner Francis M. Roache is frustrated thatthe victim has refused to cooperate with the department, whichcontacted him after he wrote to the attorney general, said policespokesman James Jordan.   The suit said that John L. Smith Jr., 25, allegedly ran a redlight early on May 12 and sped off when a cruiser tried to pull himover. More than a dozen cruisers gave chase for about 15 minutesuntil Smith's car hit a curb.   According to the complaint, Smith turned off the engine and satin the car, but officers smashed the windows and hauled him out. Oneofficer then began beating Smith on the back of his head and kneeswith his baton, the complant said.   More officers arrived and Smith was handcuffed. Several officerssurrounded him, delivering kicks and other blows, the complaintcharged. Eventually 13 officers were present, some of whom stoodabout chatting during the beating, the suit said.   Officers took Smith to a police station for booking. He was toldto wash his face for photographing, the complaint said.   Smith was treated at a hospital for for cuts, bruises, pain andblurry vision.   Police charged Smith with such offenses as operating under theinfluence of drugs, failing to stop for a red light and assault.</TEXT></DOC>
