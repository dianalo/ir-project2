The federal agency's plan, which includes manyanti-pollution measures approved more than a year ago by theregional South Coast Air Quality Management District and theCalifornia Air Resources Board, seeks to cut carbon monoxideemissions in this part of the state by 86% by the year 2004,with the same reduction in ozone emissions by 2010.</LP><TEXT>   Daniel W. McGovern, EPA's western regional administrativedirector, said the agency &quot;reluctantly&quot; included guidelinesfor so-called no-drive days as a &quot;backstop measure&quot; forreducing carbon monoxide emissions if the state and localplans are unsuccessful by their own deadline, the year 2000.The no-drive plan would use odd or even numbers on autolicense tags to alternate driving days.   &quot;It is in the spirit of presenting all possibilities thatwe are presenting the no-drive day,&quot; Mr. McGovern said. &quot;Itis not one we are endorsing.&quot;   The EPA was forced to issue the plan as a result of a 1988lawsuit by the California Coalition for Clean Air and theSierra Club. An EPA official termed timing of the new plan&quot;awkward&quot; because state and local authorities were developingmore stringent pollution plans for the Los Angeles area thatmay render the federal plan unnecessary.   Mr. McGovern said that since Congress and the presidentwere revamping the federal Clean Air Act, the new plan soonmay become obsolete and require another revision.   Environmentalists who brought the lawsuit called the EPAplan insurance that will help make the state and regionalgovernments stick to their guns, although they noted that thefederal plan takes longer to achieve the goals set by thestate.   &quot;We're disappointed that they did not adopt the state'stimetable,&quot; said Jan Chatten-Brown, president of theCalifornia Coalition for Clean Air.   Most measures in the EPA plan don't take effect untilafter 1996, and then only if state and regional efforts havefailed to reduce pollution sufficiently.   The federal proposals that could become effective before1996 include winter and summer reductions in gasolinevolatility, increases in the oxygen content in wintergasoline and enforcement of federal guidelines to reformulategasoline to further reduce emissions.</TEXT></DOC>
