The laminates, sold under the Arborite trade name, are used in counter tops and other decorative surfaces. Sales of the business weren't disclosed. A Domtar spokesman said the two plants have a total of 250 employees.    &quot;It's a marginally profitable business because of its small size compared with its competitors,&quot; the spokesman said.    The company plans to continue its plants' production of low-pressure laminates, used in furniture and shelving, he added. Domtar is a maker of pulp and paper, building materials and chemicals. </TEXT></DOC>
