Voter opinions change in the course of a campaign, and therecent round of surveys testing Bush against Dukakis, with andwithout Jackson, may bear no resemblance to the outcome six monthsfrom now, pollsters said in interviews this week.   But the polls do establish a benchmark from which futuremovement can be judged, they said. And taken in context, the pollscan highlight candidate strengths and weaknesses, providing cluesto the campaign's likely course.   ``We're not clairvoyant. This the way it is right now. It'sApril. It's not November. It's close in April,'' said ABC News pollchief Jeff Alderman. ``If Dukakis was trailing Bush by 20 points,we could say something now.''   That lack of a big lead for the better-known Bush is oneimportant result of the recent polls.   ``It's not too early to know that it's a close race,'' said CBSNews poll director Warren Mitofsky. ``Obviously things are going tohappen between now and November that will change this. That's whatcampaigns are all about. But it's fair to conclude that there'sgoing to be a contest.''   The biggest spread between the likely nominees was in a pollconducted April 21-22 for Time magazine: Dukakis had an 11-pointlead over Bush, 50 to 39. A Gallup poll April 21-23 showed avirtual tie, Bush 45, Dukakis 43, as did a USA Today-CNN poll April20-21, Dukakis 45, Bush 43.   The margin of error was plus or minus three percentage pointsfor each of the three polls.   History demonstrates that such early polls don't always predictthe result. In late May 1984, an ABC News-Washington Post poll putWalter Mondale 11 points behind President Reagan among likelyvoters. Immediately after the Democratic convention, Mondale, on acrest of good publicity, pulled even with Reagan in some polls. Buthe lost in November by 18 points.   During the campaign, Mitofsky noted, Mondale came out for highertaxes. A similar ``silly'' move could cost Bush or Dukakis just asdearly, he said.   Because many voters have not made firm choices thus far thisyear, poll numbers are liable to ``jump around,'' partly throughdifferences in survey methods, said Andrew Kohut, Gallup'spresident. He said that could explain the Time poll's relativelylarge lead for Dukakis.   More important, while polls ``are a pretty good indication ofhow voters feel today,'' Kohut said, ``you have to keep in mindwhat today represents.''   The polls were done shortly after Dukakis' big win in New York,and thus amid considerable positive publicity for the Massachusettsgovernor, Kohut noted. In contrast, there was little news of Bushthat week. The result: a favorable bias for Dukakis.   That may change, Alderman said, as Dukakis becomes better knownand undergoes more critical scrutiny. The polls' key message forthe moment, he said, is that Bush is not the shoo-in some analyststhought him to be.   ``One of the myths of the election was that the Democrats can'twin,'' Alderman said. ``The Democrats can win. I think people arebeginning to see that now.''   There is less agreement among pollsters on surveys that suggestvice presidential candidates. Alderman said other polls haveindicated that most voters solely consider the presidentialnominee: Even the dramatic choice of Geraldine Ferraro asDemocratic vice presidential nominee in 1984 seemed neither to helpnor hurt the ticket.   Nonetheless, the recent polls did indicate an impact if Jacksonran as the vice presidential candidate. While the Gallup pollshowed Bush and Dukakis about even when their names alone weregiven, a proposed ticket of Bush and Rep. Jack Kemp, R-N.Y., had a10-point lead over a Dukakis-Jackson ticket, 50-40.   The USA Today-CNN poll, asking about Bush with an unnamedrunning mate against Dukakis and Jackson, had the Republicans up49-42. The Time poll, done the same way, had the Democrats ahead47-42, but had Dukakis farther ahead of Bush without Jackson on theticket.   ``I think it's clear ... that Jackson hurts the ticket,'' saidI.A. Lewis, pollster for The Los Angeles Times. Also, becauseopinions are not fully formed, the proposition of a Dukakis-Jacksonticket right now may be drawing uncritical support from bothDukakis and Jackson supporters, he said.   ``What you're not measuring now is the people who like Dukakisbut not Jackson, or the people who like Jackson but not Dukakis,''Lewis said.</TEXT></DOC>
