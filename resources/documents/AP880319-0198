(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Apple Computer Inc. is rocking thepersonal computer industry with a lawsuit against one of its mostimportant allies, Microsoft Corp., and rival Hewlett-Packard Co.   Apple is charging that Microsoft, of Redmond, Wash., andHewlett-Packard, of Palo Alto, are selling software that infringeson the copyright on the way information is presented and controlledon its Macintosh computer.   Hewlett-Packard on Friday disputed Apple's claims and said itintends to oppose the suit vigorously. Microsoft withheld comment.   Several computer executives expressed disappointment withApple's suit.   ``The whole industry has existed by taking what is there andimproving on it,'' Adam Osborne, president of Paperback Software ofBerkeley. ``Is that going to end? If so, it'll be a disaster for usall.''   In the suit, filed in U.S. District Court in San Jose onThursday, Apple seeks to prevent further sale of Microsoft'sWindows 2.03 program and Hewlett-Packard's New Wave softwareprograms.   Windows and New Wave were developed for personal computers madeby or compatible with those of International Business MachinesCorp., Apple's chief competitor, and are aimed at making thecomputers easier to use.   Like the Macintosh, they employ a mouse pointing-device, andsuch on-screen displays as icons, scroll bars, pull-down menus, anddialogue boxes. These features replaced more complicatedinstructions, and made the Macintosh one of the easiest computersto use.   Apple's chief operating officer, Delbert Yocam, said the companymerely is protecting its investment.   The suit could affect Apple rival IBM, whose audio and visualfeatures, called the ``user interface,'' for its new line ofcomputers is expected to resemble the Macintosh's. The program,called Presentation Manager, is being co-developed by IBM andMicrosoft.   Industry observers credit the Macintosh interface with givingthe computer a competitive edge over IBM's current line.Presentation Manager could eliminate that advantage.   In its complaint, Apple alleges Microsoft overstepped the boundsof a licensing agreement it made with Apple several years ago.Hewlett-Packard's New Wave, in turn, requires Microsoft's Windowsto operate.   Apple has sued before to protect its products. In 1982, thecompany challenged Franklin Computer Corp., which was developing acompatible version of its Apple II, and won.   Apple also has prevented the import of Apple II clones by Asiancompanies through legal challenges and cooperation with U.S.Customs.</TEXT></DOC>
