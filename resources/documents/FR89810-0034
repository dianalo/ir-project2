It is made in response toUnited States Customs Service (Customs) efforts to eliminate paper filings,informal industry requests for changes in the existing rules and procedures,and the FCC's desire to reduce the burden associated with handling theexisting Form 740. This proposal should result in the elimination of asignificant and duplicative regulatory burden upon the imports industry,allow Customs to move from a paper system to an automated system, and allowthe FCC to spend its limited resources on the most productive and importantaspects of its imports program.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATES: </T2>Comments must be submitted on or before September 28, 1989,and reply comments on or before October 13, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESS: </T2>Federal Communications Commission, Washington, DC 20554.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2>Richard B.
