Air pollution will grow more severe, water will be redistributed and demands on electricity will increase, according to the report by the Environmental Protection Agency.    Effects will vary from region to region. San Francisco Bay will grow saltier, soybean crops around the Great Lakes more robust and coastal cities, like Miami, will need more storm sewers.    A world significantly &quot;different from the world that exists today&quot; is outlined in the EPA study, the first comprehensive government report on the issue.    The idea of global warming, the so-called greenhouse effect that results from gases from fossil fuels trapping heat next to the earth, is accepted by scientists around the world. Changes to the environment are inevitable, the EPA said, because past greenhouse gas emissions already have locked in some future warming.    The study, which focused on the potential health and environmental effects of global warming, is the first of two that Congress has requested from the EPA. The second will examine policies that could lessen current concentrations of gases that contribute to global warming.    Last summer's drought, scientists have told congressional committees, was not caused by global warming, but hinted at what could lie in the decades ahead as the earth warms by 1.5 to five degrees Celsius.    &quot;The scientific consensus is very strong,&quot; said William R. Moomaw, director of climate, energy and pollution programs at the World Resources Institute in Washington. &quot;The science is very solid on this.&quot;    Mr. Moomaw, a member of the EPA science advisory board that will review the report before it is delivered to Congress, believed that it might prompt policy changes, because it addresses regions specifically. &quot;It's going to be much more meaningful for a member of Congress to see what it means for his district in Iowa or California or New England,&quot; he said.    Water availability will change, with coastal waters rising and water inland growing more scarce. A rising sea level, for example, could flood dry lands in the Southeast. In California's Central Valley, which accounts for 10% of the U.S. farming receipts, irrigation will have to be increased as spring runoff from the Sierras decreases.    Construction costs to compensate for these changes would be high. Costs to protect developed shorelines could reach $111 billion through the year 2100 if the sea level rises one meter, according to the study. The report estimates sea-level increases by that year at 0.5 meter to two meters, and says that despite efforts to protect shoreline an area the size of Massachusetts could be lost. More severe summer heat will increase demand for electricity, which could require spending $325 billion to build power plants.    Animal and plant life also will be affected by the global warming. Coastal fisheries could be damaged. And while climatic zones may move hundreds of miles to the north, the report says, animals and plants might not be able to migrate as quickly.    Human mortality rates also would be altered by the changing climate's effect on contagious diseases, like influenza, that are influenced by the weather. Respiratory diseases might become more severe as ozone air pollution increases in warmer temperatures.    The report also predicted, however, that basic requirements for food and water would be met in the U.S., particularly as the population adapts to a changing climate. But the ability of Third World countries to adapt is less certain. &quot;It may be much more difficult for poorer and less mobile societies to respond to climate change,&quot; the report said. </TEXT></DOC>
