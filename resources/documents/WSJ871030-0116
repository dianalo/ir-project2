The mood echoes the relaxed style these days of Mr. Chiang's policies. Under his leadership the Nationalist government has been shucking regulations that date as far back as 1949. That's when the communists conquered the mainland and forced Mr. Chiang's father and presidential precursor, Chiang Kai-shek, to retreat, with two million followers, to Taiwan. Chiang Kai-shek died in 1975, and Chiang Ching-kuo took over leadership of the Nationalist government first as premier and then, in 1978, as president.    It's just this past year that Mr. Chiang's reforms have moved fast enough to draw world attention. He has allowed an opposition party to organize, lifted martial law, cut back currency controls and -- earlier this month -- relaxed the longstanding ban on travel to the People's Republic.    The word on the street in Taipei is that the 77-year-old president is hurrying to make his political mark while his health holds out. He suffers from diabetes, and has recently begun making public appearances in a wheelchair. Probably more to the point, the Republic of China by now has weathered de-recognition by the U.S. President Carter switched recognition to the People's Republic in 1978, a move that panicked the Nationalists and set back Mr. Chiang's previous liberal shift. Taiwan's per-capita income has reached $5,000. Its foreign reserves, at $68 billion, are among the world's highest. The Nationalist Party feels it can afford to satisfy the growing public craving for political freedom.    The informal session with Mr. Chiang left an impression of a president who talks with acuity and good humor on a wide range of subjects. It's clear that -- whatever a skeptical world might say -- Mr. Chiang is determined to preserve the hope that a free China might someday extend its system back to the mainland. The current liberalizations are part of a plan for reunification that he says &quot;will be achieved not by force, but by political, social and economic means.&quot;    Mr. Chiang does not believe such a reunification could ever take place while mainland China remains communist. The theme of his observations is that communism, whether Chinese or Soviet, is the century's greatest problem. He should know. As a young man he left China to study in Stalin's Russia, and was forced by Soviet authorities to remain there 12 years. In 1937 he returned to China with his Russian wife, Faina. He then joined his father's Nationalist government.    From talk of Mr. Chiang's past, conversation turns to the challenges today. One concern is that the Nationalists' legislature is still filled largely with representatives from mainland constituencies -- elected before the communist takeover on the mainland. Taiwan is represented simply as a province. Under the Nationalist constitution there's no fully democratic solution to this problem short of retaking mainland China and calling elections. But in the interest of &quot;democratization&quot; and &quot;invigorating the Parliament,&quot; Mr. Chiang's administration has been turning over more seats to representatives elected on Taiwan, leaving vacant seats of mainland representatives who have died. This trend toward greater local representation will continue, he says, &quot;because of the increase in population and the age of our members.&quot;    Another step toward democratization, though Mr. Chiang doesn't mention it, is his apparent determination not to hand over the presidency to any of his children. His likely successor is Vice President Lee Teng-hui, who was born in Taiwan.    Another big issue within the Nationalist government right now is how to handle the foreign exchange that keeps flooding into the national till. The $68 billion in foreign reserves sounds pretty good, but when he's asked about it, Mr. Chiang shakes his head. &quot;The accumulation of reserves -- it's not funny,&quot; he says. &quot;It's a big headache for us.&quot; The problem is that the central bank must print money to buy all those dollars. Then, for fear of the money supply growing too fast, it borrows back that money and holds it largely in the form of U.S. government securities, incurring billions in foreign-exchange losses and crowding out domestic borrowing.    Mr. Chiang isn't yet ready to opt for dropping import barriers and letting people spend their dollars on more foreign goods. He waves the idea aside -- though he does say he worries about friction over Taiwan's growing trade surplus with America. &quot;I think the best way is to increase domestic expenditure,&quot; he says. &quot;We have already slashed tariffs on many items and we will continue to do that . . . but we cannot afford to take them all off because the government still depends on import tariffs for some of its revenue.&quot;    By now, though the president seems ready to go on chatting, his aides are getting restless. They remind him he's got other duties. Mr. Chiang apologizes that he cannot stand up to say goodbye, but sits slightly taller in his chair as his visitors shake his hand. The most vivid impression that remains is of a man who didn't hesitate an instant when asked what he considered the single most important lesson of a lifetime that has spanned most of this century: &quot;Eradicate communism.&quot;    ---   Miss Rosett is editorial page editor of The Asian Wall Street Journal. </TEXT></DOC>
