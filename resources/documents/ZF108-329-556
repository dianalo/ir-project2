 I'mreferring, of course, to the premiuer graphical user interface (GUI) forpersonal computers--the Microsoft Windows environment.andM;Similar to our other columns, productivity is the name of the game and ourmajor focus.andP;  To accomplish this goal, I will view and explore Windows from avariety of angles.andP;  Although I will deal primarily with matters affecting enduse, I won't hesitate to discuss technical issues or ignore the needs ofthose managing and developing Windows applications.andP;  Consequently, you'll bereading about a broad range of topics to help you to understand and useWindows more effectively.andM;Windows is not so much a program as it is an operating environment.andP;  Hence,software which runs under Windows is of substantial interest and I willreport on a variety of such programs.andP;  These will include flagship productsfrom major software houses as well as from the rapidly growing shareware andpublic domain collection of Windows utilities and programs.andM;Windows offers a complete, standardized, and fully supported user interfacewith rich graphics facilities.andP;  As a result, a number of companies are nowdeveloping specialized hardware with Windows as its controlling software.andP;  Inaddition, many firms are writing Windows programs to serve in-house corporateneeds.andP;  You will be surprised at the range of such activities and I will tryto keep you informed about these imaginative uses.andM;When Windows first appeared on the scene, its main target machines were XTand AT class computers with low-medium-resolution displays and dot matrixprinters.andP;  Little concern was expressed by hardware manufacturers to makespecial accommodations for the needs of Windows.andP;  Since then, however,hardware design has been influenced by Windows, especially in the realm ofhigh performance and high-resolution displays.andP;  I'll try hard to keep you upto date on these and related developments--it's quite important to know whathardware solution are best for optimizing how Windows is presented.andM;From the beginning, Windows has had its supporters and critics.andP;  ExperiencedMS-DOS users are often annoyed by the use of menus and dialog boxes toaccomplish tasks that can be handled more quickly by a simple command line.andO;Similarly, the lack of useful utilities also discouraged the use of Windowsas a full-time command shell.andP;  We've all discovered that although Windowsdoes provide some support for non-Windows applications, the relationship isnot always a happy one.andP;  Others are more comfortable in Windows and so theyalmost never revert to the DOS prompt.andM;But even Windows enthusiast have not been very pleased with its appearanceand functionality.andP;  In particular, new shells have been written and newmethods have been devised to customize Windows in certain ways.andP;  We'll keepclose tabs on some of these innovations as they develop.andP;  In fact, I willalso provide occasional utilities, similar to those found in our Utilitiescolumn, that will enhance the use of Windows in much the same way our regularutilities have enhanced the use of DOS.andM;Some people use only a restricted (run-time) version of Windows because theywant to run only a particular program.andP;  Others have the standard Windowsversion installed, but run it for the same reasons and almost never use it asa command shell.andP;  Finally, a few run Windows almost exclusively.andP;  I hope youwill share with us how you configure and use Windows along with yourquestions, concerns, complaints, and the topics you would like to seediscussed.andM;Windows itself is under constant development and has undergone severalchanges since its beginning.andP;  Today's Windows combined with improved hardwarehas overcome many of its previous limitations--lack of useful software, lowperformance, high memory demands, and a tenuous existence with non-Windowsapplications.andP;  Soon Windows will take a major step forward by offeringfeatures that rival OS/2.andP;  The new decade promises an exciting period forWindows and I look forward to providing you with the latest indepthinformation about this remarkable product.andM;Since this is a new column, I think it is useful to establish some commonground.andP;  So, before we take the plunge into actually working with Windows,let's begin by describing what Windows was and what it is today.andM;EARLY WINDOWSandM;Windows, Version 1.01, was released by Microsoft in November, 1985, after adevelopment effort of some years.andP;  All together it was a remarkable technicalachievement considering its many conflicting goals.andP;  The goals then were nodifferent than they are now.andP;  Basically, Windows tries to provide you with amultitasking windowing system that works across a broad selection of machinesand displays, by using a variety of keyboards and pointing devices for input,and by driving a representative group of printing machines while supportingboth Windows and other standard applications.andM;Following this direction, a number of interesting design decisions were made.andO;Many of these have continued to influence the appearance and thefunctionality of the product as well as the development of PresentationManager for OS/2.andP;  For example, Windows will multitask Windows applications.andO;However, the task switch is not carried out preemptively by a clock; instead,it depends on each application giving up control of the central processor ina timely fashion.andP;  Severly criticized by some, this non-preemptivearchitecture has proved to be much less troublesome than first thought.andP;  Evenso, those programs which need to carry out an extended process require somecare in design in order to be well behaved.andM;If there are several applications running at once, each one needs access tomachine and operating system resources.andP;  In DOS the appropriate libraryroutines are simply linked to the program when it is created.andP;  In Windows itwas impractical for each application to contain all the routines necessary toaccess the hardware.andP;  To eliminate such redundancy, the idea of the dynamiclink library (DLL) was introduced.andP;  Windows device drivers (those modulesthat control the hardware) are actually DLLs.andP;  so is the graphics deviceinterface (GDI), as well as many other modules in Windows.andP;  A givenapplication makes it final connections with these resources only at executiontime.andP;  In this way, many tasks can share the same code and data.andM;Because several applications may be present in memory at once, Windows alsoneeded a means of managing the available space in a transparent way.andP;  In DOS,programs requiring lots of memory are usually handled by overlays; theirmanipulation is the responsibility of the program itself.andP;  In Windows, theapplication writer divides the program into reasonably sized segments andspecifies their properties.andP;  when the program runs, Windows takes on theresponsibility of loading into memory only those segments required at thattime.andP;  Others are discarded or moved about, if necessary, to optimize usageof the available space.andP;  Dynamically allocated global and local memory blocksare managed similarly.andP;  In a transparent way, Windows provides a virtualmemory space much larger than the available real memory.andM;If Windows is to be useful, applications must be written to use itscapabilities.andP;  Even before its first release, interested ISVs (independentsoftware vendors) were provided with a development environment that includeda special version of the Microsoft C compiler and libraries.andP;  And althoughthe API (application programmer's interface) has greatly expanded, its coreremains substantially unchanged today.andP;  Programs which were written carefullyfor Windows 1.0x still work more or less correctly today.andM;In addition to providing support for ISVs, Microsoft also found itadvantageous to assist hardware, peripheral, and computer manufacturers inorder to extend the platforms available to Windows.andP;  A t the time whenWindows first appeared there were a number of MS-DOS computers on the marketwhich were either not 100 percent IBM compatible or had quite differentarchitectures.andP;  Many of these machines used superior video displays andfaster CPUs, but occupied a smaller market.andP;  Similarly, there were simply toomany different kinds of printing devices for Microsoft alone to support.andO;Therefore Microsoft found it necessary to provide a separate OEM (OriginalEquipment Manufacturer) adaptation kit to facilitate the porting of Windowsto additional hardware.andM;It was at this level that I first became acquainted with Windows.andP;  My firstjob in the personal computing industry was to use the rapidly changing andincomplete OEM kit to bring Windows up on the ATandamp;T 6300 using the excellent640- by 400-monochrome display developed by Olivetti.andP;  Later, I extended thiseffort to include a color display quite unlike the EGA, a keyboard mouse, atouch screen, and finally, a touch-screen and mouse combination (one thatseemed to offer the best of both worlds).andP;  it was a testimony to the basicWindows architecture (a virtual machine connected to the hardware throughdevice drivers) that such diverse means of getting input and displayingoutput worked so well together.andP;  An even more substantial accomplishment wasmade by Zenith Data Systems when they began to distribute Windows for theirZ100, an S-100-based MS-DOS machine with little resemblance to the IBM PC.andM;Finally, let us mention an additional, important feature of Windows, whichperhaps was not part of its original specification but appeared in its firstrelease--support for standard DOS applications.andP;  For this task, Windows wasdesigned to perform two jobs.andP;  If a DOS program is well-behaved, then awindow is created for it and the program runs as if it were connected to anANSI terminal.andP;  If, on the other hand, the program is less friendly to itsenvironment, Windows becomes a means for context switching between itself andthe program.andP;  It is even possible to have several different instances of suchapplications.andP;  Although if Windows itself is suspended, a degree of dataexchange is possible.andP;  When all this works, the user has the best of posibleenvironments.andP;  Alas, one soon runs out of memory and there is no protectionbetween tasks.andP;  Acting as a DOS-control program has never been one ofWindows' best features.andM;Of course, not all the concepts of Windows 1.0 have endured.andP;  For example,the most obvious characteristic was the use of tiled windows.andP;  Justified onthe grounds that the machines and displays of those days lacked the necessaryspeed and resolution, tiling has since been replaced by the overlappingwindows we see today.andP;  You cannot use a daisy wheel printer except as ageneric device.andP;  Light pens are no longer supported as pointing devices (atleast on the standard retail release) and, there is no longer a way toinstall Windows without a hard disk!andM;So, why was Windows 1.0 received with such mixed reviews?andP;  Performance wasone issue.andP;  Despite some clever coding, especially in display drivers, thedemands of Windows often exceeded the capabilities of 4.77-MHz 8088 machines.andO;The appearance, especially the tiled windows, made the product look somewhattoylike and the defaults chosen for color displays were less than subtle.andO;Experienced DOS users, with or without mice or other pointing devices, foundthemselves handicapped by what was supposed to be a more intuitive approach.andM;Most of all, Windows lacked a broad base of software support.andP;  Large softwarehouses did not rush to port their applications to Windows and it fell uponless well-known firms to begin the slow process of assembling theconsiderable offerings available today.andP;  Without basic software, there waslittle reason to use Windows except to access the desktop accessories or torun the excellent drawing programs from Micrografx.andP;  Of course, it was alwayspossible to try Windows as a control program for DOS, but Windows itselfmight easily take nearly one-half of the available memory, making theexecution of many old applications a doubtful prospect.andM;THE NEXT STEPandM;Almost two years after its first release, Windows 2.03 appeared sportingoverlapping windows instead of tiled.andP;  Thus, Windows had gone from the tidyto the untidy desktop motif.andP;  This is not a detrimental statement; rather itis a way of describing windows which may partially or completely obscure oneanother.andP;  The best analogy is a desk with papers scattered about and lyingone upon the other.andP;  Just as the papers can be moved around, rearranged, andhidden, so can the windows be moved and made into icons.andM;Other noticeable changes included greatly expanded machine, printer, keyboardand display support, and improved installation, but with the same desktopofferings.andP;  Of course, software from other vendors had grown considerably andAldus Pagemaker had been ported from the Macintosh to Windows.andP;  Internally, anumber of changes had occurred.andP;  Expanded memory support, although withlimitations, was added to facilitate the combined use of Windows and standardapplications.andP;  It became possible to move data to and from old applicationsthrough the clipboard and dynamic data exchange (DDE).andM;To handle the increased workload, several changes were made to improve thedisplay of graphical information on the screen.andP;  The major change wasincreased text-output speed, which required a change to the format of fontfiles.andP;  Bit-block transfer and line drawing were also improved by theaddition of special-case code.andP;  Naturally, the size of display drivers nearlydoubled, but in compensation the drivers were segmented more carefully sothat initialization and infrequently used code were not always present inmemory.andP;  Finally, when the hardware could perform the task, new code wasadded to save and restore bitmaps overwritten by pop-up menus and dialogboxes.andM;A SIDE TRIPandM;At the same time that Windows 2.0 appeared, Microsoft released a specialversion, Windows/386, to take advantage of the 8086 emulation mode on the80386 chip.andP;  The goal was to provide a better means of running Windows andstandard applications together.andM;When Windows/386 runs, a virtual 8086 machine is created and Windows isexecuted.andP;  At that point, you can execute a number of MS-DOS applications.andO;Each application starts in its own virtual machine and each virtual machineruns concurrently and can be scheduled preemptively.andP;  The program may be runin a full-screen display or in a window.andP;  Thus, for the first time, Windowswas operating in a protected-mode environment while taking advantage of allavailable memory.andP;  Windows/386 provides an operating schema more akin to OS/2and offers a choice of ways to manage the machine.andM;WINDOWS TODAYandM;During the summer of 1988, Windows, Version 2.10, appeared in two differentforms--Windows/286 and Windows/386.andP;  Although the implication is that Windowswill run only on 80286 or 80386 processors, the 286 version can run on an8086 machine.andP;  Similar to Version 2.03 in appearance, Version 2.10 provides anumber of bug fixes, upgraded printer and display device support, andimprovements in both extended and expanded memory utilization.andM;Microsoft Windows is certainly one of the best software bargains around.andO;Retailing at slightly less than $100, it is often discounted to about $60.andO;Quite often it is free with some other purchase or is bundled with hardware.andM;The package contains several disks containing nearly 200 files of varioustypes: Windows control programs and dynamic link libraries, Windows desktoputilities, Windows device drivers, Windows printer drivers, fonts, DOS devicedrivers and utilities, and extensive documentation.andP;  The files support a widerange of displays, computers, keyboards, mice, and printers, and areavailable in several languages including English, German, French, Spanish,Italian, Swedish, Dutch, and Kanji.andM;Installation of Windows is straightforward.andP;  A few questions are asked aboutdesired memory arrangement, printers, and country of use; displays andmachines are usually detected by the installation program but can be easilyoverridden.andP;  Device drivers, system and OEM fonts, the Kernel, and the Userand GDI libraries are assembled into a couple of large files--WIN200.BIN andWIN200.OVL.andP;  These files, along with the desktop utilities, some fonts, and afew miscellaneous files, are placed into the Windows directory and theprogram is ready to run.andP;  Unfortunately, you have to reinstall Windows if youwant to change keyboard language, the display, or the mouse, unless you knowsome of the secrets supplied to OEMs and ISVs.andP;  Perhaps the next version ofWindows will allow you a more flexible installation.andM;The desktop has scheduling activities (CALENDAR), a calculator (CALC), a game(REVERSI), a text editor (NOTEPAD), a clock (CLOCK), a file program(CARDFILE), a communications program (TERMINAL), a drawing program (PAINT),and a word processor (WRITE).andP;  The latter three programs represent asubstantial development effort on the part of Microsoft.andM;A shell program (MSDOS) controls Windows.andP;  From it you can perform suchoperations as changing directories, formatting disks, creating newdirectories, and executing programs.andM;Whereas Windows/386 provides its own expanded memory manager and requiresonly extended memory for operation, Windows/286 comes with a number of devicedrivers for use with AST and Intel expanded memory boards.andP;  In addition, bothcontain a RAM disk driver (RAMDRIVE) and a caching program (SMARTDRV) forMS-DOS that are Windows aware.andP;  Finally, a device driver called HIMEM hasbeen supplied which, among other things, allows Windows to use the firstsegment of extended memory, when available.andP;  Therefore, memory utilization ismaximized without having to switch into protected mode.andM;Today, you gain considerable productivity from Windows for several reasons.andO;First, there is an impressive range of professionally written softwarecovering nearly every aspect of computer usage.andP;  Both DOS and Windowsapplications can be run concurrently, and most importantly, they can sharedata with each other through a variety of means ranging from manual transfersthrough the clipboard to automatic data updates using DDE.andP;  Performance on80286 and 80386 machines is very good and the current crop of video boardsprovide high-resolution display in both color and monochrome.andP;  The quality ofprinted material is quite high and can be produced relatively fast.andP;  Memoryutilization within the limits imposed by MS-DOS has been optimized.andM;Yet, all of us who use Windows have felt that before Windows can reach itstrue potential the memory restrictions inherent in real-mode operation mustbe overcome.andP;  No improvement is more sorely needed in the next generation ofWindows.andP;  Figure 1 shows what Windows used to look like (Version 1.x), whileFigure 2 illustrates how it looks today (Windows 2.x).andP;  Figure 3 shows thePresentation Manager display--how thenext version of Windows will probablylook.andM;Well, that's it for a quick and dirty history.andP;  Next time I'll begin adetailed exploration of Windows.andM;Two things make a person more productive: knowledge of the environment, andthe proper tools to get the job done.andP;  Providing you with the knowledge andthe tools will be my job here.andP;  But remember that the lifeblood of any columnis user feedback.andP;  The bottom line is that for this column to succeed I needfor you to interact with me.andP;  It will be your job to send me your questionsand share your tips--if you've developed a handy utility send it and maybe wewill publish it.andP;  I look forward to hearing from you and sharing all thingsthat are related to Windows.andM;OPENING WINDOWSandM;Share your experiences with the Windows environment.andP;  We'll pay you $50 forany tips we print.andP;  Please send your letter on a disk along with a printout.andO;Mail your contributions to Windows, PC Magazine, One Park Avenue, New York,NY 10016, or upload them to PC MagNet (see the &quot;By Modem&quot;
