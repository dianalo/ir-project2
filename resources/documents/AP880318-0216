Oliver North, the fired nationalsecurity aide facing trial in the Iran-Contra affair, announcedFriday he has asked to retire from the Marine Corps and said he maysubpoena ``the highest-ranking officials in our government'' aspart of his defense.   North submitted his request on Thursday, asking that he beallowed to retire effective May 1 when he will have completed 20years of active military service, Pentagon sources said.   That is the minimum amount of service required to retire with apension. With 20 years of service, North is entitled to a pensiontotaling 50 percent of his base monthly pay, or slightly over$22,000 a year.   In a statement read in the office of his attorney, BrendanSullivan, North said the lawyer ``has informed me that the defenseagainst these charges may require him to issue subpoenas for thetestimony and records of the highest ranking officials in ourgovernment.''   ``That strikes me as a course of action incompatible with mycontinued service as a Marine officer,'' he continued.``Accordingly, with great sadness, I have tendered my request toretire from the Marine Corps.''   North, who wore a civilian business suit in place of his usualribbon-bedecked Marine uniform, refused to answer questions afterreading the statement.   North said he has ``silently endured a torrent of mediaspeculation'' during 16 months of Iran-Contra investigations. Hesaid he had not responded ``except when required by law,'' and that``further silence is a disservice.''   ``While on active duty, I am not fully free to speak out or totake other actions which may be necessary,'' North said.   A man, apparently a private security guard, controlled theaccess of reporters and photographers to the room where North readhis statement. Before North entered, the guard told the press to``keep your hands out of your pockets'' and to make no ``quickmoves.''   According to one official, who agreed to discuss the matter onlyif not identified, North has available a substantial amount ofaccumulated leave and probably will stop working as a staff officerat Marine Corps headquarters pending his retirement.   North was reassigned to headquarters in November 1986 afterPresident Reagan fired him as an aide to the National SecurityCouncil.   The sources said there was nothing to block approval of North'sretirement request.   They noted that Rear Adm. John Poindexter, North's former bossand Reagan's former national security adviser, exercised his rightto retire from the Navy late last year.   North, Poindexter and two others were indicted by a federalgrand jury Wednesday on charges they conspired to divert Iranianarms sales profits to the Nicaraguan Contra rebels.   The 23-count indictment, which also named retired Air Force Maj.Gen. Richard V. Secord and his business partner, Albert Hakim, saidthe defendants organized, directed and concealed ``a program tocontinue funding of and logistical and other support for militaryand paramilitary operations in Nicaragua by the Contras'' at a timeU.S. law barred such action.   North vowed after the indictment was returned to fight thecharges, declaring: ``I did not commit any crime.''   North, a much-decorated combat veteran of Vietnam and graduateof the U.S. Naval Academy, testified last year before Congress thathe always believed he had the approval of his superiors to take theactions he did.   Poindexter, during his testimony before Congress, said he neverinformed the president of his decision to divert arms sale profits.   The 44-year-old North is currently drawing a base pay of$3,693.60 per month. Under military retirement rules, he will beentitled to half that _ or slightly more than $22,000 a year.   According to one source, North was technically required toprovide the Marine Corps with four months' advance notice beforeretiring. The service is unlikely to balk, however, at granting hima waiver of that advance-notice requirement, the source added.   One Pentagon official said Gen. Alfred M. Gray, the Marine Corpscommandant, had already approved North's request and that it wasnow awaiting only the approval of the Navy secretary's office.   ``And that should come on Monday,'' said the source. ``This isall very routine.''   According to the Defense Department, the pension rights of Northand Poindexter are unlikely to be affected by the outcome of thelegal cases against them since both men served honorably for atleast 20 years.   ``Generally speaking, a conviction does not affect eligibilityfor a military pension,'' said Col. David Shea, a Pentagonspokesman.</TEXT></DOC>
