HilderStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 07/02/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> FIN GOVMT FBANKS, THRIFT INSTITUTIONS (BNK)TENDER OFFERS, MERGERS, ACQUISITIONS (TNM) </IN><TEXT>   Financial Corp. of America, parent of the nation's largest thrift, said it expects to report a second-quarter loss of $150 million to $200 million. Most of the loss apparently stems from an increase in loan-loss reserves of more than $100 million.    The loss will cut Financial Corp.'s net worth, or assets minus liabilities, about in half from $320 million at March 31. Thrift-industry executives believe the big loan-loss provision was at least partly the result of pressure from federal thrift regulators, and that it increases the chances that Financial Corp. will be acquired by another company with assistance from the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp.    Common shares of Irvine, Calif.-based Financial Corp. plunged 87.5 cents yesterday to close at a 52-week low $3.625 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading of more than 1.3 million shares.    Financial Corp. didn't say how much it will add to loan-loss reserves in the quarter. However, by subtracting other parts of the expected loss, it appears that the total second-quarter loan-loss provision will be between $115 million and $165 million, analysts said. Since 1984, Financial Corp. has added about $1.2 billion to its loss reserves.    Financial Corp. officials wouldn't comment on whether the company had been pressured to increase loan-loss reserves by the Federal Home Loan Bank Board. However, in a statement issued yesterday, Financial Corp. said, &quot;Still outstanding are some important regulatory-reserve and scheduled-items matters which are under discussion and review with the Federal Home Loan Bank regulators.&quot;    &quot;Scheduled items,&quot; which the Bank Board monitors closely, are generally defined as delinquent loans and foreclosed real estate. In January 1986, the Bank Board changed its definition of scheduled items in ways that thrift executives and analysts believed would force Financial Corp. to increase its loan-loss reserves. Financial Corp. hasn't yet completed a review of its American Savings andamp; Loan Association unit to classify loans and other assets according to the new rules.    &quot;What a disaster,&quot; said Jerome I. Baron, thrift analyst for Prudential-Bache Securities Inc., after Financial Corp.'s announcement. &quot;It makes it more obvious that there has to be some sort of FSLIC-assisted transaction for American Savings andamp; Loan to get out of this mess,&quot; Mr. Baron said.    &quot;It means also that any holder of any Financial Corp. security probably is at great risk,&quot; Mr. Baron said. He added that depositors at American Savings aren't at risk of incurring losses.    Financial Corp. officials declined to elaborate on the company's statement.    In last year's second quarter, Financial Corp. earned $11.6 million, or 23 cents a share. The results reflected loan-loss provisions of $60.1 million and an operating loss of $14.1 million, which were more than offset by $85 million in gains from the sale of mortgage-backed securities.    In yesterday's announcement, Financial Corp. said part of the expected second-quarter loss stems from the write-off of its $23 million investment in the FSLIC secondary reserve. The reserve, which totals $824 million, was wiped out in May when FSLIC was forced by government auditors to report that it is insolvent by about $6.3 billion.    Financial Corp. also said yesterday it expects to report a second-quarter operating loss that should be smaller than the $17.3 million operating loss reported in this year's first quarter.    Financial Corp. said other reasons for the expected loss report include a change in rules for accounting for renegotiated loans -- which will result in bigger loan-loss provisions -- and higher interest rates.    Financial Corp. didn't say how much of the loan-loss provisions resulted from the change in accounting rules, which took effect in April. However, Financial Corp. said the change &quot;had a severely adverse impact&quot; because the company renegotiated &quot;a large volume&quot; of loans in the second quarter.    At March 31, Financial Corp. had about $1.6 billion of renegotiated loans, on which borrowers were paying an average interest rate of between 5% and 6%, company officials said. The original interest rates on the loans averaged about 12%.    The rise in interest rates that began in April hurt Financial Corp. because it depressed the prices of mortgage-backed securities. Since 1985, Financial Corp. has depended on profits from trading mortgage-backed securities to offset operating losses and loan-loss charges.    Jonathan E. Gray, a thrift analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein andamp; Co., estimated that the market value of Financial Corp.'s mortgage-backed securities portfolio currently is $1.2 billion less than its $17.38 billion book value as of Dec. 31. Financial Corp. doesn't disclose unrealized losses on such securities on a quarterly basis.    As previously reported, the Bank Board has been seeking a buyer for Financial Corp. that would be willing to inject about $1 billion in capital into American Savings, to bring its capital up to the required level. The FSLIC would agree to absorb some of Financial Corp.'s future losses.    Finalists in the bidding are: Ford Motor Co.; an investor group led by former Treasury Secretary William E. Simon; and a partnership that includes Richard E. Rainwater, a former investment manager for the Bass family of Fort Worth, Texas, and Equitable Life Assurance Society of the U.S.    One official involved in talks between the Bank Board and the bidders said yesterday's action apparently &quot;reflects the fact that the Bank Board wants to have Financial Corp. do something.&quot;    It isn't clear how current Financial Corp. shareholders would be treated if the company is acquired, but the various proposals call for their ownership interest to be severely diluted or wiped out.    The second-quarter loss would reduce the capital of American Savings, as calculated under regulatory accounting principles, to between $361 million and $411 million, or between 1.1% and 1.2% of liabilities. American Savings is supposed to maintain its capital at 4% of liabilities plus 20% of scheduled items, or a total of $1.7 billion. </TEXT></DOC>
