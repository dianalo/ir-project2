Seven people were arrested.   About 50 Armenian protesters, members of the Organization ofNational Self-Determination, waved Armenian flags and held bannerssupporting nationalist leader Paryur Ayrikyan.   The group demonstrated without interference for about 30 minuteson the steps of Lenin Library. But riot police stopped them frommarching to nearby Red Square and twice pushed them through thedoors and down the stairs of a subway station.   Police ripped banners away and dragged away two protesters whoresisted. They detained five more who subsequently refused todisperse.   The nationalists said they had not requested permission fromauthorities to hold the demonstration. ``We didn't ask anybody'spermission. We don't ask, we demand,'' said demonstrator IgorGrigoryan of Moscow.   Police were negotiating with a handful of demonstrators todisperse them more than an hour after the protest began. They tolddemonstrators they were willing to release those who had beenarrested if the group dispersed.   One demonstrator, Lev Gambaryan, entered a bus where thearrested protesters were being held and he said they did not wantto come out.   Ayrikyan, a former political prisoner, was arrested in Moscowearlier this spring and exiled to Ethiopia. He now lives in theUnited States.
