But oppositionfrom insurance companies could hobble the initiatives.   Regulators and industry representatives say the meeting ofthe National Association of Insurance Commissioners inIndianapolis focused on tightening controls on the solvencyof insurance companies. &quot;You look at the agenda and you'llfind more than the usual number of solvency items,&quot; said JimLong, North Carolina's commissioner of insurance andpresident of the association.</LP><TEXT>   Regulators said they felt a sense of urgency as they aimedto forestall federal intervention in regulation of theindustry. &quot;We may have a window of opportunity to get thesechanges through,&quot; said William McCartney, Nebraska's chiefinsurance regulator.   Rep. John Dingell, (D, Mich.), is leading the charge amonglegislators in Washington for federal involvement inregulation of the insurance industry and has held hearings onthe effectiveness of the state regulatory system. AlthoughRep. Dingell's staff has put together a draft proposal, nobill has been introduced.   Among the measures discussed that would tighten regulationof financial health of insurers was a proposal to forcecompanies to conform to so-called risk-based capital rules.The measure would require insurers, who are now subject tolax state requirements, to raise large amounts of capital.That proposal is expected to be adopted by the end of theyear and could go into effect by the end of 1992.   Regulators also adopted a guideline that would, if adoptedby the individual states, limit insurance company junk bondholdings to 20% of assets. They also discussed a new set ofregulatory standards that state insurance departments need toadopt in order to be accredited by the NAIC. Among the ideascurrently being discussed is a proposal that would requiremulti-state insurers to conform to the rules of accreditedinsurance departments where they operate, even if thedepartments in their home states are not accredited.   But the regulators' race to put in place tougher standardsis being met with resistance from insurance companies. &quot;Ourcritics tell us we're moving too slow, but the industry sayswe're moving too fast,&quot; Mr. Long said.   Some regulators say the new get-tough attitude is causinga strain in the relationship between regulators and insurancecompanies. &quot;Maybe tempers are a little more short than inpast years,&quot; said Mr. Long.   Indeed, industry representatives, who have been allowed alarge role in shaping regulatory changes in the past, saythey now feel excluded from the process.   &quot;We see a trend of moving along very quickly without theindustry's involvement,&quot; said Larry Kibbee, vice president ofthe Alliance of American Insurers, a trade group for propertyand casualty insurance companies. Both the risk-based capitalrules and accreditation of state departments are moving alongquicker than the industry would like, he says.   Not everyone believes state insurance regulation ischanging at all, much less quickly enough. Nancy Turnbull,deputy commissioner in Massachusetts, objects to the level ofsocializing between regulators and the industry at the NAICmeetings. &quot;Last night in the restaurant we were at, it wasone contingent of regulators together with industry peopleafter another. It's unseemly,&quot; she says.   Other regulators say they object to the fact that industryrepresentatives vastly outnumbered regulators at theconference. &quot;There are four or five times the number ofindustry people we need here,&quot; said Nebraska's Mr. McCartney.   But efforts to restrict the industry's presence at themeetings have largely been unsuccessful. Six months ago, theNAIC decided to eliminate its opening reception to theconference, which usually attracts a large number of industryrepresentatives. But, according to Mr. McCartney, &quot;We had somany complaints from regulators who said this was the onlytime they got to see colleagues from other departments thatwe decided to put it back on.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
