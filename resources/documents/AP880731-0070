The television evangelist told about 200 Christians visitingfrom the United States and Canada that Jesus would return to themountain where they were seated.   ``I don't know if I'm coming back to this hotel, and I don'tknow if you'll be coming back, but I know Jesus is coming back,''he said. The Louisiana-based preacher was speaking after a dinnerat the Intercontinental Hotel restaurant on the mount.   After a sermon on Jerusalem's history, Swaggart called sinnersand nicotine addicts to gather around him so he could pray fortheir salvation.   ``People bound by nicotine _ you must be delivered fromnicotine,'' Swaggart said. ``There are worse things than nicotine,but this is a place to get free.''   Dozens of listeners raised their hands hesitantly, then stood upand approached the restaurant's makeshift pulpit.   ``I command the bondage to be broken... I am asking that Satan'shold be broken,'' Swaggart said in a special prayer for smokers.``These people belong to God...You are trespassing.''   The evangelist said he has never smoked a cigarette in his life.   Swaggart stepped down from the pulpit last February afterconfessing to an unspecified sin. A prostitute, Debra Murphee ofIndiana, later said he paid her to pose naked for him in a NewOrleans-area motel.   The Assemblies of God denomination revoked Swaggart's ministrycredentials in May, when he insisted on returning to hismulti-million dollar ministry instead of waiting out a yearlongsuspension demanded by the church.   About 350 American followers joined him on a weeklong tour toIsrael's biblical sites. The group arrived last Thursday.   According to the Bible, the Mount of Olives is the site whereJesus started his triumphal entry into Jerusalem and was laterarrested.</TEXT></DOC>
