But we just can't strive for the NIT. We want to getto the NCAAs.&quot;;   Coach Mike Montgomery has established a consistent patternof success, going 100-57 over five years, chalking up three 20-win seasons andthree seasons ago he led the Cardinal to its first NCAA tournament since 1942three seasons ago.;   Last season's NIT showcased Stanford at its best. Afterlimping through an 8-10 Pacific 10 Conference season without Andrew Vlahov,its toughest player mentally and physically, the Cardinal went 5-0 in the NITand beat four teams on the road.;   &quot;The NIT let us feel good aboutourselves,&quot; Coach Mike Montgomery said. &quot;There were times last year we weren'tfeeling good about ourselves. . . . To be able to go on the road and win madeus feel good. It was a constant building process.&quot;;   Yet the proverbialalso-ran label still dogs the Cardinal, and Stanford doesn't figure to shed itthis season.;   Stanford has an anchor in Keefe -- the 6-foot-9 forward-centerwho turned down NBA millions to play his senior season -- but precious littlestability elsewhere.;   For that reason, Pac-10 coaches picked Stanford tofinish eighth. One preseason publication picked it as high as 25th in thenation, lending credibility to NBA scouts' projections of Keefe as a lotterypick.;   But Keefe, no matter how great, is still the Cardinal's solereturning starter. Montgomery must pick a core of shooters and some up-frontphysical men from 17 players, including eight freshmen.;   &quot;I'm looking for 10or 12 guys who can play,&quot; Montgomery said, &quot;and I've got to find them in thefirst month.&quot;;   The Cardinal has a solid, and arguably more effectivesuccessor to point guard John Patrick in junior Marcus Lollie, who providesthe quickness and ball-handling Patrick didn't have. But after Lollie, there'sa gray area.;   Ideally, 6-foot-6 forward Brent Williams and 6-4 guard KennyHicks, both part-time starters last season, should get starting jobs. ButMontgomery questions both players' work ethics.;   &quot;Brent can be a greatplayer, but he hasn't shown it yet,&quot; he said. &quot;Same with Hicks.&quot;;   TheCardinal needs shooters to hit the open jumper when Keefe is double-teamed.Montgomery favors 6-5 junior Peter Dukes, who has shown leadership andshooting ability in early practices and is impressed by freshmen guards BobbyPatton (&quot;good shooter&quot;), Andy Poppink (&quot;very skilled&quot;) and David Harbour (&quot;atough kid&quot;).;   Stanford also needs more production out of center Jim Morgan,(2.9 points and 2.9 rebounds per game), but more importantly, Montgomery wantsto see more toughness from Morgan.;   &quot;Jim is a kid my mother loves, but weneed some mothers not to like him,&quot; said Montgomery, who is also looking forthe 6-11 sophomore to be a more consistent scorer. &quot;The days of catching theball and going up and and looking real good but missing the shot are over.&quot;;  Montgomery believes if Stanford can gain confidence in the preseason, the teamcould come together by the start of conference play in January. But he's alsoa realist.;   &quot;Sometimes I look at these kids and I'm encouraged and sometimesI think, 'Oh, my God,' &quot; Montgomery said. &quot;Frankly, I haven't seen them do thethings that it would take to make us successful.&quot;;   If somebody doesn't stepup soon, an NIT bid might be a lofty expectation.; (box) KEY STRETCH: Jan. 23through Feb. 8. After games against USC, UCLA, Washington State, Arizona andArizona State, Stanford ought to have a good gauge as to how good it is.;  (box) KEY STAT: Stanford will need better perimeter shooting to make up forthe 20 points-per-game provided by last year's backcourt of John Patrick andKenny Ammann.;   (box) KEY NEWCOMER: Could be Andy Poppink, a 6-foot-7freshman from Tecumseh, Michigan, who has the size, versatility andballhandling skills to play anywhere from power forward to point guard.;  (box) DID YOU KNOW: Stanford is picked to finish eighth by Pac-10 coaches butis picked as high as 25th in the nation by some publications.
