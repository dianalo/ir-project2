Section 28 of the Arms Control and Disarmament Act (22 U.S.C. 2568) providesthat ``A program for visiting scholars in the field of arms control anddisarmament shall be established by the Director [of the U.S. Arms Controland Disarmament Agency] in order to obtain the services of scholars fromthe faculties of recognized institutions of higher learning.'' The law states that ``The purpose of the program will be to give specialistsin the physical sciences and other disciplines relevant to the Agency'sactivities an opportunity for active participation in the arms controland disarmament activities of the Agency and to gain for the Agency theperspective and expertise such persons can offer. * * * Fellows shall bechosen by a board consisting of the Director, who shall be the chairperson,and all former Directors of the Agency.'' In honor of the first Directorof ACDA, William C. Foster, who served from the inception of ACDA in 1961to 1969 and died on October 15, 1984, scholars are known as William C.Foster Fellows. ACDA initially implemented this program by competitively selecting sixvisiting scholars for the 1984-85 school year to perform specific activitiesat ACDA for which their services had been identified as being needed. Thisprocess was repeated for the 1985-86, 1986-87, and 1987-88 school yearsand it is intended that the process will be used again this year with one-yearassignments beginning at a mutually agreeable time during the period fromJuly 1988 lasting until mid September 1989 for the positions in ACDA'sfour bureaus described in the Appendix to this announcement. Note thatthe emphasis is on the expertise and service which the visiting scholarscan provide rather than on general interest in arms control and the pursuitof the scholars' own research. It is planned that the visiting scholars will be assigned by detail andcompensated in accordance with the Intergovernmental Personnel Act. Inaddition to pay based on their regular salary rates, the visiting scholarswill receive travel to and from the Washington, DC area for their one-yearassignment and either per diem allowance during the one-year assignmentor relocation costs. Visiting scholars must be citizens or nationals of the United States andon the faculty of a recognized institution of higher learning. Prior toappointment they will be subject to full-field background security andloyalty investigation for a top secret security clearance including accessto Restricted Data, as required by Section 45 of the Arms Control and DisarmamentAct. Visiting scholars also will be subject to applicable Federal conflictof interest laws and standards of conduct. Selections will be made without regard to race, color, religion, sex, nationalorigin, age, or physical handicap which does not interfere with performanceof duties, and all qualified persons are encouraged to apply. Applicationsshould be in the form of a letter indicating the position(s) in which theapplicant is interested and the perspective and expertise which the applicantoffers. The letter should be accompanied by a curriculum vitae, and anyother materials such as letters of reference and samples of published articleswhich the applicant believes should be considered in the selection process.(If published materials are submitted, it is requested that they be providedin twelve copies, if possible.) Applications, and any requests for additional information, should be sentto: Visiting Scholars Program, Attention: Personnel Officer, Room 5722,U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, Washington, DC 20451.

Visiting Scholar Assignments to the Bureau of Multilateral Affairs ofACDA  <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Description of the Bureau of Multilateral Affairs  </ITAG>The Bureau of Multilateral Affairs (MA) has primary responsibility withinACDA for arms control issues dealt within multilateral fora. The Conferenceon Disarmament, the Mutual and Balanced Force Reduction negotiations, theConference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, and the United NationsGeneral Assembly are the most important examples. MA provides both technicalbackstopping and diplomatic support to these substantive activities aswell as to other negotiations which seek to reduce forces in Central Europe,to build confidence, to ban radiological weapons, to study negative securityassurances, to limit military expenditures, to research nuclear weaponsfree zones, and to eliminate chemical and biological weapons.  <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Nature of Assignment (MA/ISP)  </ITAG>The International Security Program Division of the Bureau of MultilateralAffairs (MA/ISP) has responsibility for the Conference on Disarmament (CD)which started life in 1979 as a multilateral arms control negotiating forumin Geneva, although its ancestry dates back to the Ten Nation DisarmamentCommittee of the late 1950's. The CD now consists of 40 members, includingmost members of the Warsaw Pact and NATO as well as 21 non-aligned nations.Its annual session is divided into two parts, February-April and June-August.Active items on its agenda include chemical weapons (the U.S. submitteda draft convention to ban all chemical weapons in 1984), radiological weapons,outer space and nuclear testing.  The First Committee of the United Nations General Assembly is the othermajor forum for which MA/ISP has responsibility. The U.S. delegation coordinatesthe U.S. position on disarmament resolutions with other Western and non-aligneddelegations, as appropriate, and participates in the general debate. TheGeneral Assembly has no direct authority over the CD, but the CD transmitsannual reports on its work to the United Nations, and the First Committeemay pass resolutions recommending courses of action to the CD.  A visiting scholar assigned to MA/ISP would study the CD and General Assemblyforums, in part through the daily responsibilities of interagency coordinationand delegation work. The Visiting Scholar would study selected issues onthe CD agenda to assess negotiating possibilities for the U.S.  The Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) will be insession in Vienna during this period, considering, among other things,the outcome of the Conference on Confidence and Security Building Measuresand Disarmament in Europe (CDE) which has recently concluded in Stockholm.The future of the CDE will be decided by its parent CSCE conference, witha key issue being the agenda of a follow-on CDE conference.  Closely tied to follow-on CDE conference issue are talks for a mandateon negotiations for the reduction of conventional forces in Europe, alsotaking place in Vienna, Austria. These negotiations will succeed the MutualBalance Force Reduction talks, ongoing since 1973 without notable progress. A visting scholar assigned to this Division of the Bureau of MultilateralAffairs (MA/ISP) would analyze the interrelationships of these variousnegotiations for the purpose of assessing their future roles within thelarger framework of U.S. national security policies. In addition, the scholarwould study the more general problems and the possibilities of conventionalarms control in Europe.  <ITAG tagnum="81">3.
