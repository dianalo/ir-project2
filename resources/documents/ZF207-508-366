 The agency complies with the Brooks Act and has acentral authority for IRM, which is delegated to me.andP;  I delegate to each ofthe management sectors in the regions, short of going to the General ServicesAdministration for delegation of procurement authority.andM;The regions report to regional administrators appointed by the president.andO;Within the limits of the statutes and federal regulations, I've tried toarrange it so there are few occasions when somebody needs approval inadvance.andM;My theory is, if there is a performance problem, it shows up.andM;GCN: Does autonomy cause problems in interoperability or standards?andM;HANLEY: No, it doesn't.andP;  My office budgets for, purchases, installs andsupports most of the computing technology in the regional offices.andP;  They playan active role in early decisions about the direction of our technical plans,but the decisions about the baseline technology and protocols we support weremade a long time ago.andP;  Our goal now is to stay current.andM;Beyond standard software packages, the only real policy we enforce -- andthis applies more to headquarters than regions -- says you can do anythingyou feel necessary within the privacy of your own workplace.andP;  Once you stepoutside your own unit and do things that require other people to submit datato you or learn new software or support new protocols, then it becomes mybusiness.andM;It's our responsibility to provide mainframe service and telecommunicationsnodes not only to regions but to state capitals.andP;  We also budget for andmaintain midrange processors in every EPA region.andM;The research and development laboratories around the country budgetseparately for midrange processors.andP;  We manage their acquisition andinstallation and the network that ties them together.andP;  Sometimes we buy abasic amount for every location.andP;  Sometimes we intervene to correctinequities.andM;GCN: How would you characterize the relationship of regional offices withstate governments?andM;HANLEY: Well, there is the theory and there is the fact.andP;  EPA attempts tohave a very close working relationship with state environmental agencies,attorneys general and other agencies involved in environment and naturalresources.andP;  Our success is mixed.andP;  The trend over the last four or five yearshas been toward better and closer working relationships.andM;Some states depend on our dollars.andP;  A larger number of states depend on thelegal and moral authority of the federal government to deal with powerfuleconomic forces.andP;  Large industries, for that matter, want a strong federalpresence so they won't have to deal with a tangle of environmental standardsfrom state to state.andM;We cannot accomplish environmental protection without the states, withouttheir public involvement.andP;  You can't get consensus by force.andP;  You cannoteffectively protect the environment over the long haul without the states'land use powers.andP;  There is no federal land use planning control authority, nopolice power.andM;Those authorities under our Constitution belong to state and localgovernments.andM;GCN: You've been an outspoken critic of some General Services Administrationinitiatives -- a new review board to settle disputes between vendors andagencies, and a GSA decision to require agencies to submit additional datawhen obtaining a delegation of procurement authority.andM;HANLEY: you mentioned two things, I don't think you could find many others.andM;I have agreed with much of what Frank Carr and Frank McDonough have done overthe years.andP;  I was concerned about reforms announced by Pat Szervo three orfour months ago.andM;The first proposal, the review process, essentially amounted to vendors'being able to appeal to GSA when they didn't like an agency's decisions,particularly the specifications, not so much the actual award.andP;  The secondreform was for GSA to ask for more information about some procurements.andP;  Ifound no problem with that.andM;The set of reforms changed from the time they were first discussed.andP;  The oneI objected to so strenuously has been dropped, as far as I can tell.andP;  Thesecond one is a fairly reasonable request for more specific information aboutcertain classes of procurements.andP;  For example, they're paying closerattention to IBM-compatible mainframe procurements, for obvious reasons.andM;The first proposal essentially meant vendors could run to GSA to complainonce they had failed to obtain satisfaction from an agency.andP;  It lessened thelikelihood for them to talk constructively to agencies.andP;  It had none of thefeatures of good government or due process that it ought to have, that theBoard of Contract Appeals has.andP;  There was no provision for any documentation,no public record, no independent body involved.andM;GCN: Some environmental groups say EPA is not getting the air and the watercleaned up.andP;  Have you got it pretty much covered in the area of automation?andO;Is the agency failing elsewhere?andM;HANLEY: Let me say, all [these programs] look wonderful and by comparisonwith what we had a few years ago, they are.andP;  We haven't had them that long.andO;I would be lying if If said we use technology as well as we should and will.andO;Our experience has been that it takes three years minimum for an institution,at least this one, to digest a new technology and start putting it to realuse.andM;If I go out tomorrow and buy a relational database, I don't care what thevendors and the slick articles say, it will be three years before there is acritical mass of programmers and managers who understand it and haverequirements that have been thought about so the technology can be brought tobear.andM;We rely heavily on contractors.andP;  Depending on what function you talk about,somewhere between half to 70 or 80 percent of our work force is contractors.andO;It takes a long time to get everybody up to speed.andM;We were one of the first agencies to set up separate professional acquisitionunits in both the IRM office and the procurement office.andP;  But that doesn'tmean we are using the technology or the information as well as we should.andO;We've just laid a foundation.andM;I'm here, like many people at EPA, because I believe in protecting theenvironment.andP;  I'm sure as hell not here for the money.andP;  In fact, the last payraise brought me up to the salary I made as a consultant in 1976.andM;We certainly haven't done everything well and wisely.andP;  But when thesecriticisms are leveled, I've noticed people conveniently fail to mention acouple of things.andP;  Quite often the federal statutes do not enable us to takethe action they want us to.andP;  We go to court and we lose when we makeexpansive interpretations of federal statutes.andM;Some people have been highly critical of us.andP;  Those who oppose the new cleanair legislation are saying, &quot;We wouldn't need the new Clean Air Act if EPAjust enforced the old one.&quot;andM;In fact, the apportionment of the burden of reducing sulfur emissions wasnegotiated with the Hill.andP;  The consensus involved protecting the softcoalindustry for a time.andP;  It's clear it didn't achieve the Clean Air Act goals,but the process of deciding how far to go in protecting the environment hasbeen difficult and incremental.andM;We haven't begun to scratch the surface as a society.andP;  I don't mean EPA.andP;  Icould tell you right now that we feel strongly that the agency has got tohave full access to a supercomputer.andP;  The new regulatory approaches on cleanair require very large models.andM;The new law, by the way, eliminates reliance on models in one area butyincreases it in another.andP;  EPA already is a heavy user of supercomputing inNational Science Foundation centers.andP;  But as the research is finished and themodels come online for regulatory decisions, we're going to need our own.andM;The criticisms aren't going to stop.andP;  And they aren't necessarily a badthing.andP;  I believe a lot of the criticisms have been unfair, but that doesn'tmean I'm right or the critics should be quiet.andP;  I really think most people inEPA regard this kind of criticism as a sign that what we do is important.andP;  MyGod, what could be worse than being ignored?andM;GCN: What did you do at the Valdez oil spill in Alaska?andM;HANLEY: The scooper boats don't work well with the high-density heavy crudes.andO;The clog 'em up.andP;  We've cleaned up stuff like that before but only in smallamounts.andM;We've never had [a cleanup] where the failings of the technology mattered agreat deal.andP;  The Bush administration has vested EPA with responsibility fordeveloping this technology and for leading an interagency effort forlong-term cleanup.andM;One of the things we're starting to work on in the emergency response officeis a simple-minded planning/tracking system we and the other seven or eightagencies involved in this long-term effort can use to record mutualcommitments and progress.andM;I should emphasize, not only because it's true but in the spirit ofinteragency cooperation, that some of the best stuff has been done by NOAA,often with EPA financing, ranging from the development of local emergencyresponse systems to remote-sensing meteorology.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
