Henley's announcement was its first since Santa Fe made a separate peace with Olympia andamp; York Developments Ltd., another suitor. That pact appears to have dealt a heavy blow to Henley's planned proxy battle.    Santa Fe stock surged yesterday following Henley's announcement, closing up $1.625 a share at $45.25 in New York Stock Exchange consolidated trading. The volume was heavy, at 2.2 million shares. Henley stock gained 25 cents a share to close at $20.875 on moderate volume of 589,000 shares.    Henley's latest purchases lift its stake in Santa Fe to about 15.7% from 14.95% reported Jan. 19. La Jolla, Calif.-based Henley, a manufacturing, engineering and financial services concern, said it now holds about 24.5 million of Santa Fe's 156 million shares outstanding.    Michael D. Dingman, Henley's chairman and chief executive officer, lashed out at constraints that seem to have allowed Santa Fe to drive a wedge between its unwanted suitors.    In a written statement, Mr. Dingman charged that Santa Fe &quot;manipulated its poison pill (defense) to give management an illegal advantage in the proxy contest.&quot; Henley already has challenged in Delaware state court last-minute changes that Santa Fe made in its shareholder rights plan, also known as a poison pill.    It's expected that the Delaware case may be broadened to incorporate new allegations since, as previously reported, Santa Fe reached an accord with Toronto-based Olympia andamp; York that calls for two officers of the closely held real estate development and natural resources concern to be nominated to the 17-member Santa Fe board.    Olympia andamp; York, for its part, agreed in the pact to support &quot;the direction of&quot; Santa Fe's planned restructuring -- a program calling for the sale of several units and real estate holdings and a $4.7 billion special distribution to shareholders. Olympia andamp; York currently holds a 10.15% stake in Santa Fe.    The two suitors were barred from talking to each other because of changes in Santa Fe's shareholder rights plan that could have triggered the so-called poison pill if two parties whose joint holding totaled more than 20% communicated with each other.    While Henley and Olympia andamp; York apparently weren't in direct communication, it was widely expected that Henley, in its proxy campaign, would nominate two Olympia andamp; York officials as part of its dissident slate for the five Santa Fe board positions open at the next annual meeting.    The loss of Olympia andamp; York's prospective support appears to have sharply undercut Henley's position. However, analysts noted that Henley may have a number of options open, including forceful pursuit of the proxy fight, litigation challenging Santa Fe's use of the poison pill to block talks between Henley and Olympia andamp; York while negotiating with Olympia andamp; York itself, and even a tender offer for the remainder of Santa Fe after payment of the huge $4.7 billion dividend.    Santa Fe's current stock price, minus the $30-a-share dividend, suggests that the stock may change hands at $15 a share when it begins to trade ex-dividend next Monday. At that price, it would cost Henley about $2 billion to buy the stock it doesn't now own -- an amount well within its ability to finance, analysts said. </TEXT></DOC>
