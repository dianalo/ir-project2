It reportedlycarried surveillance equipment to monitor Israel's Arab enemies.   The silver craft was set aloft south of Tel Aviv, wherewitnesses saw it arch and watched as booster rockets disengaged andfell to the sea. The launching made Israel the eighth country knownto possess a rocket powerful enough to put a satellite into space.   A spokesman for Jane's Defense Weekly, the London-based defensemagazine, said the Israeli satellite was believed to be ``carryinga 3-kilogram (1.2-pound) payload for surveillance purposes,''apparently for monitoring activity in Arab countries.   Foreign Minister Shimon Peres discounted fears that thelaunching would spur an arms race with its Arab enemies.   ``It's not an arms race,'' Peres said on Israel radio. ``TheArabs bought missiles and produce missiles and will do anythingthey can anyway.''   Tony Banks, a reporter for Jane's who is known to have closeties to Israeli military sources, said Israel was not thought tohave the capability to install its own sophisticated surveillanceequipment in a satellite.   ``U.S. optical equipment is assumed to have been used in thepayload,'' Banks told The Associated Press in London.   Foreign reports said earlier that the satellite was a test craftthat would precede the launching of a spy satellite.   Yuval Neeman, head of Israel's space agency, described thelaunching as ``all in all, very clean work.''   He called the craft a ``technological satellite'' butacknowledged: ``There's military potential in all this activity.''   Meir Amit, former head of Israel's Mossad secret service andcurrent chief of Israel's General Satellite Corp., said thelaunching could give Israel independent access to satellitepictures currently provided by the U.S. government.   ``If you ... are fed from the crumbs of others according totheir moods, this is very inconvenient and very difficult,'' Amitsaid on Israel radio. ``If you have your own, independentcapability, you climb one level higher.''   Neeman said the satellite, launched shortly before noon, ``roseto a height of about 250 kilometers (155 miles). That will be itsclosest point to Earth. It will reach a distance of about 1,000kilometers (620 miles).''   ``It will revolve around the Earth in about an hour and ahalf,'' Neeman said on Israel radio. ``The satellite will fly forabout a month. Afterward, it will burn up.''   The other countries known to possess the technology to launch asatellite are the United States, the Soviet Union, China, Japan,France, Britain and India.      The launching came a day after Israel's 10-member inner Cabinetapproved the mission, according to Israeli media reports.   Plans to launch an experimental satellite surfaced Sunday in theIsraeli media, which quoted reports in the British weekly FlightInternational and Time magazine as saying the test craft wouldprecede putting a spy satellite in orbit.   Israeli leaders refused to comment on those reports.   The Israeli daily Haaretz quoted experts as saying the odds werehigh that something would go wrong during Israel's first attempt tolaunch a satellite.   Unidentified defense experts told the Hadashot daily Sunday thata spy satellite would provide faster and more accurate informationabout enemy military movements on the ground and save money byreducing the number of reconnaissance flights.   But Gerald Steinberg, a former U.S. space expert now living inIsrael, told the Jerusalem Post a single spy satellite would be``almost meaningless'' in helping to defend Israel.   An entire system of satellites costing about $10 billion wouldbe needed to make a serious contribution, the Post quoted Steinbergas saying.   Until now, Israel has relied on reconnaissance aircraft andpilotless drones for intelligence-gathering.   Work on the Israeli satellite started in 1983, when Israel'sspace agency was created. The carrier rocket was built jointly bythe Rafael weapons development authority and space aircraftindustries.   According to foreign reports, Israel secretly fired amedium-range missile over the Mediterranean last May in preparationfor launching a spy satellite.   Israel has limited access to U.S. space satellite information.But some Israeli leaders have made no secret of theirdissatisfaction with this arrangement.   ``The relations between the United States and Israel, when itcomes to this, are those of a patron and his dependent,'' formerarmy intelligence chief Yehoshua Saguy told Hadashot.</TEXT></DOC>
