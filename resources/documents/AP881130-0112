ATandamp;T's cut, totaling $697 million annually, reflects lower costsfor its connections to the local network, while residential andsmall business customers will be paying a larger share of the coststo maintain the local phone network.   The rate reduction is ATandamp;T's seventh since 1984, when the companywas broken up by an antitrust lawsuit. During those five years, thecompany's prices for basic interstate long-distance have dropped atotal of 38 percent.   During that time, however, $2.60 has been added to the monthlybills of subscribers to lower the local network subsidies paid bylong-distance companies. That monthly expense will rise to $3.20 onThursday.   ATandamp;T estimates that subscribers who make at least $16 a month ininterstate long-distance calls would save enough money to offset thehigher subscriber line charge. The average residential customerspends $8.66 per month on interstate long-distance calls, thecompany said. Those totals do not include intrastate long-distancecalls.   ATandamp;T filed its reduced rate request with the FederalCommunications Commission in October. An ATandamp;T spokeswoman said thecommission did not disapprove the proposal, so the new rates will gointo effect as planned.   Other long distance companies have said they are reviewing thelatest ATandamp;T reductions.   Under ATandamp;T's proposal:   _Basic long-distance rates for calls of more than 124 miles willdrop 3.8 percent. Smaller cuts would be seen for interstate calls ofshorter distances, which account for about one-quarter of ATandamp;Tinterstate calls.   _Rates for Reach Out America, ATandamp;T's long-distance calling planfor residential customers, will be cut 4.9 percent.   _ATandamp;T WATS rates will drop 4 percent and the company willrestructure the service to bill calls individually based on time anddistance, rather than by the current hourly pricing method. Thisprice reduction would take effect Jan. 1, a month later than theothers.   _Rates for ATandamp;T's three PRO WATS calling plans for businesscustomers will be cut 3.8 percent overall. MEGACOM WATS rates willdrop 4.7 percent and MEGACOM 800 rates would decrease 4.8 percent.   _Basic ATandamp;T 800 service prices will go down 4 percent.   _Software Defined Network Service rates will see an overallreduction of 6.2 percent.</TEXT></DOC>
