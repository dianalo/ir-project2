For the diagnosis ofmany diseases, angiography is considered to be the most definitive procedureavailable. All angiographic procedures carry certain inherent risks,however, and some special circumstances many further increase the riskto the patient. Many of the risks of angiography are related to the potentialpathophysiologic effects of iodinated contrast media. In general, therisks increase with higher concentrations of contrast medium, longerduration of exposure, and greater total dosage. Potential hematologiceffects of intravascular contrast agents include red blood cell hemolysisand sludging in patients with sickle cell anemia and increased thromboemboliccomplications in patients with homocystinuria. Angiographic complicationsfrom catheter effects include hemorrhage, thrombosis, thromboembolism,vascular wall damage, and psuedoaneurysm of arteriovenous fistula formation.This paper discusses the indications and risks of angiography.</TEXT></DOC>
