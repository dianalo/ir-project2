Manglapus made the remark to reporters after a meeting withPresident Corazon Aquino during which he informed her the nearly4-month-old talks were suspended indefinitely.   ``I don't know whether the talks can resume ... but right now,our positions are so far apart that I don't think we can resume,''he said.   Manglapus, head of the Philippine panel in the negotiations,said Mrs. Aquino ``realizes that our position is a reasonable oneand that we should stick to it.'' He declined to elaborate, sayingrevealing more details could create more difficulties.   The Manila government is pressing for an increase in the $180million it receives annually from Washington for use of the bases.Before the talks began, Manglapus said $1.2 billion annually wouldbe ``more realistic.''   The talks are held every five years to review terms of the 1947agreement allowing the United States to maintain Clark Air Base,Subic Bay Naval Base and four smaller installations.   U.S. spokeswoman Mary Carlin Yates told The Associated Press ina telephone interview the break was temporary and the U.S. side,headed by Ambassador Nicholas Platt, expects the talks to resume``shortly.''   She denied the U.S. panel approved a statement that Filipinospokesman Leonides Caday described as a joint statement and read toreporters. It said: ``There was a substantial disagreement on thecompensation issue, as a result of which the (Philippine) panelmoved for the suspension of the talks.''   ``As has happened several times in the past, there has been atemporary break in the talks,'' Mrs. Yates said. ``We do notconsider the talks suspended. Such temporary breaks occur from timeto time particularly when one side needs time to consider aproposal from the other.''   During previous interruptions, however, neither side haddescribed the talks as ``suspended.'' In previous instances,spokesmen for both sides said talks had been temporarily recessedbecause of foreign travel by negotiators or to allow time to studyproposals.   On Monday, Manglapus said that the two panels were nearingagreement but that they may not complete the negotiations by anend-of-the-month deadline. The talks had initially been scheduledto end during the first week of July.   U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz has said the United Statesdid not oppose an increase in compensation but would not agree topaying any ``staggering amount.''   The talks do not directly affect the status of the bases after1991, but a successful review is widely expected to influenceManila's decision on whether to extend the agreement. Mrs. Aquinohas refused to reveal her position.   Meanwhile, the communist-led National Democratic Front, accusedMrs. Aquino maneuvering for ``an impending sell-out of our nationalsovereignty and interests.''   The front, an umbrella organization of 12 Marxist rebel groups,said in a statement delivered to news agencies by courier that theAquino administration ``has actually agreed to retain the basesbeyond (1991) in exchange for U.S. assurance of its survival.''</TEXT></DOC>
