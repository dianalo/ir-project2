Results of melter experimentsconducted at Pacific Northwest Laboratory (PNL) and Savannah River Laboratory(SRL) are presented for two feed compositions and five different liquid-fedceramic melters. The melter performance data including nominal feed rateand glass melt rate are correlated as a function of melter surface area.Comparisons are made between the actual melt rate data and melt ratespredicted by a cold cap heat transfer model. The heat transfer modelcould be used in scale-up calculations, but insufficient data are availableon the cold cap characteristics. Experiments specifically designed todetermine heat transfer parameters are needed to further develop themodel. 17 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
