Investors poured $10.5 billion into tax-saving limitedpartnerships last year, compared with a record $13.5 billion in1987, the Investment Partnership Association said.   In a limited partnership, the liability of the limited partnersin the business is limited to their capital contribution.Furthermore, partners share all earnings before taxes, whereas theowners of public corporations _ shareholders _ receive only apercentage of after-tax earnings as dividends.   The most dramatic decline in sales last year _ 73.1 percent _came in of master limited partnerships, which are traded publicly.Sales of MLPs plunged to $771 million from $2.87 billion theprevious year.   Fuhrman Nettles, vice president of Robert A. Stanger andamp; Co., aleading investment partnership research firm, attributed the slumpin MLP sales to federal tax law changes that took effect at the endof 1987.   Under the revisions, new master limited partnerships are taxed ascorporations unless they are engaged in energy, natural resources orreal estate. Before the change, only 25 percent of all MLPs met theexemptions.   ``MLPs are way down because of the tax law changes,'' Nettlessaid. ``Generally, it's made them moderately unattractive.''   The Investment Partnership Association said sales of real estatepartnerships were off 23.6 percent in 1987, equipment leasing was up1.1 percent, cable television was down 35 percent and oil and gasdown 55.8 percent.   Overall sales in limited partnerships for 1989 are projected todecline slightly, to $10.2 billion, Nettles said.   He projected that sales in oil and gas partnerships wouldincrease to $125 million from $89 million but that income from themwould be halved to $250 million.   Equipment leasing and cable television partnerships wouldincrease slightly, he said, while commodities partnerships wereunsure because of investigations into alleged corrupt trading in twoChicago exchanges.   Despite the 1988 decline, Nettles defended investments in limitedpartnerships as currently less risky than the stock market. He alsosaid limited partnerships remain a good way for companies to raiseequity in an economy heavily financed through debt.   ``It's been relatively stable compared with new issues of stocks,which have been up and down,'' Nettles said.</TEXT></DOC>
