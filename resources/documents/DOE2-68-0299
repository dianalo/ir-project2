The calculations use valuesfor the exchange interactions which were inferred from fits to the dynamicstructure factor describing inelastic neutron scattering at low temperatures.For x=0.35, 0.50, and 0.65 the specific heat is only weakly affectedby applied fields up to 10T. At the lowest concentration the applicationof a field of 10T leads to a significant reduction in the specific heat.Results are also presented for the distribution of magnon modes at variousconcentrations and fields.</TEXT></DOC>
