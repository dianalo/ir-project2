Ohio Bell and Wisconsin Bell reached tentative agreements withthe Communication Workers of America during the weekend, and talkscontinued with the other three companies that make up Chicago-basedAmeritech.   ``Negotiations are continuing to progress'' in Illinois, Indianaand Michigan, said Ameritech spokesman Steve Ford, ``and we'rehopeful that settlements will be reached in the not-too-distantfuture.''   In New York, NYNEX Corp. plans to resume bargaining with strikingworkers Wednesday, the first formal talks since that walkout startedalmost three weeks ago. The regional company serves New York andmost of New England.   Nationally, 200,000 workers in 20 states went on strike earlierthis month against four of the so-called ``Baby Bell'' regionaltelephone companies formed after the 1984 breakup of ATandamp;T. Tentativesettlements have been reached at Pacific Telesis, which servesCalifornia and Nevada; and Bell Atlantic, which covers WestVirginia, Virginia, Maryland, Delaware, Pennsylvania, Washington,D.C., and New Jersey.   While talks continued on local issues for some Bell Atlanticunits, Bell of Pennsylvania tentatively agreed on a new contractwith CWA Local 13000, representing more than 8,900 employees.   Union spokesman Alex Minishak said the settlement offers gains insuch areas as vacations, layoffs and the use of contract labor.   In the Midwest, Ohio Bell on Saturday agreed to a tentativethree-year contract with 10,000 CWA members. Wisconsin Bell settledwith its 4,200 striking employees Sunday.   Neither side would discuss details of the contract.   Talks with Bell subsidiaries in Illinois, Michigan and Indianarecessed Sunday night. Negotiators were scheduled to meet againtoday, officials said.   ``There's certainly momentum all around at this point, and we'rehopeful to reach settlements with all the companies,'' said CWAspokesman Steve Rosenthal.   ``We made excellent progress today and feel we're very close.Only a few minor details need to be worked out,'' said Indiana Bellspokesman Dennis McCabe after the two sides recessed theirnegotiations.   The union said pickets will remain up where settlements have beenreached until there are agreements in the other states.   But Ohio Bell said its expects employees to return to work.   ``It has been the company's point of view that we, in fact, havereached an agreement and what is going on elsewhere should not havean effect on our employees,'' said Mary Lou Ringle, spokeswoman forOhio Bell's Cleveland office.   About 35,000 CWA members struck the five Ameritech companies Aug.13, and there was little progress in bargaining until late last week.   In addition to the Bell companies, a settlement was reachedbetween the CWA and Ameritech Services, a subsidiary employing about600 warehouse workers in Indiana, Michigan, Ohio and Wisconsin.   Wages had been the issue in all five of the Ameritech companies,with the union balking at offers to pay a one-time, lump-sum amountas a part of any negotiated increase.   ``We paved the way to a settlement by moving some of the lump-summoney into wage increases'' in Ohio, Rosenthal said. ``Hopefully wecan do the same in the other companies.''</TEXT></DOC>
