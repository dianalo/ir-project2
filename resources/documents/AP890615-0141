McCLAIN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The operating rate for U.S. factories continuedto ease last month, the government reported Thursday, and economistssaid the slower pace so far this year should continue to coolinflationary pressures.   The Federal Reserve said the operating rate in May was 83.8percent, 0.3 percentage points below April's 84.1 percent. The Mayrate matched the rate in March, which had declined 0.1 percentagepoint from February. Rates peaked in December and January at 84.3percent, a 10-year high.   ``This is telling us that the economy still has plenty of room torun and the inflationary pressures are going to be cooling off,''said Maury N. Harris, chief economist at Paine Webber in New York.   The report ``should relieve concerns about too high a utilizationleading to inflation,'' agreed S. Jay Levy of Levy EconomicForecasts in Chappaqua, N.Y., adding that the general pattern also``should erase the fears of a too serious slowdown.''   The steady increase in operating rates last year had causedeconomists to worry about accompanying inflationary pressures. Thecloser U.S. industry gets to full operating capacity, the greaterdifficulty it has producing enough to meet demand, leading toshortages and price increases.   Until recently, the Fed had been pushing up interest rates in anattempt to cool those inflationary pressures without slowing growthso much that the economy slides into a recession.   ``It's (the slowing operating rate) consistent with the Fed'ssoft landing scenario,'' said economist Cynthia Latta of DataResources in Lexington, Mass. ``Certainly some of the pressure onthe productive capacity is easing and that should translate intoless upward pressure on prices.''   Last month's operating rate of 83.8 percent was up from 82.9percent a year earlier.   The operating rate fell 0.3 percentage points to 84.0 percent atmanufacturing plants, returning to the March operating level. Priorto April, the rate had declined since it peaked at 84.7 in January.   Analysts generally consider an operating rate of 85 percent orabove as an indication of inflationary pressures.   The rate at factories producing durable goods, big ticket itemsexpected to last more than three years, fell from 82.8 percent inApril to 82.5 percent in May, reflecting decreases in mostcategories.   The rate at factories producing non-durable goods edged down from86.3 percent to 86.0 percent last month.   In another report Thursday, the central bank said industrialproduction was unchanged in May after a 0.6 percent hike in April.Production had edged up 0.1 percent in March after falling 0.2percent in February, the first decline in a year.   The Fed's industrial production index stood at 141.4 percent ofits 1977 base, 3.9 percent higher than a year ago and the same aslast month's index.   Production fell 0.1 percent at manufacturing plants making bothdurable and non-durable goods.   Output at mines and oil wells rose 1.2 percent following a 1.0percent jump in April. The May output was 1.4 percent higher than ayear ago.   Production at utilities edged down 0.5 percent after remainingflat in May.</TEXT></DOC>
