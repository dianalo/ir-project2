As a sample,low calorie peat mined in Japan which included natural humic acid contentsof 38.5 % was selected and sized to 150 mesh or under. By the reactionfor 6 hours using nitrogen dioxide of 1 vol % with a space velocity of1000 h{sup -1} to the sample, a product containing 76 to 80 wt % humicacid was formed with a yield of 107 wt % based on the starting material.The reaction behavior was found to be similar to the reaction model ofJander's formula where velocity of chemical reactions forming humic acidis proportional to the 1/2 power of gas phase concentration and inverselyproportional to the grain size of peat. By increasing the nitrogen dioxideconcentration to 34 vol %, the reaction ended in 1/6 of the time takenfor the previous case. Recovery ratio of oxidizers which was less than30 % at the beginning of the oxidation increased to more than 70 % threehours later. (7 figs, 4 tabs, 13 refs)</TEXT></DOC>
