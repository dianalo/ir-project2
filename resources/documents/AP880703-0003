(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Officials named threeadditional sites where Soviet inspectors will monitor compliancewith the treaty to eliminate medium-range nuclear missiles.   One group was to leave Travis early Sunday for a cruise missiletesting and training facility at Fort Huachuca, Ariz., about 60miles south of Tucson, said Master Sgt. Richard Castillo, aspokesman at Travis.   Another group will visit Davis-Monthan Air Force Base nearTucson, a missile training center that later will be an eliminationsite where Soviets can monitor missile destruction, Castillio said.   A third team will inspect the Pebulo Army Depot in Pebulo,Colo., where Pershing II missiles are stored and repaired, he said.   The Soviet teams are part of a contingent of 70 missilespecialists who arrived at Travis on Friday night.   A group of 22 Soviet on-site inspectors was welcomed Saturday toSalt Lake City to begin its spot check at the Hercules AerospaceCo. missile plant in Magna, Utah, where Pershing II missiles bannedunder the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces Treaty were produced.   A group of U.S. inspectors arrived in the Soviet Union on Fridayunder the treaty signed by President Reagan and Soviet leaderMikhail Gorbachev in December.   The INF pact, the first to allow such on-site inspection, isviewed as a trial for the proposed Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty,which would slash arsenals of long-range superpower nuclear weaponsby 30 percent to 50 percent, and involve much more complicatedverification procedures.</TEXT></DOC>
