A series of headaches awaits Dinkins, the first black mayor ofthe nation's most populous city. And though they are common to mostcities _ crack, crime, AIDS, the homeless _ they've become nastymigraines in New York.   ``I congratulate him and I wish him well, but I don't envyhim,'' former Mayor John Lindsay said the day after Dinkinsdefeated Republican Rudolph Giuliani. ``New York faces toweringproblems and we've got nowhere to turn for help.''   Lindsay was referring to the underlying problem: money. Theeconomic boom of the '80s has passed, revenues are slipping andAlbany and Washington have problems of their own.   Dinkins will be staring at a potential billion-dollar deficit inhis first budget.   ``He faces enormous problems,'' said outgoing Mayor Edward I.Koch. ``The question will be, how will he handle the dollars thatare available?''   Giuliani, in conceding defeat, said, ``Our city is troubled indeep and serious ways.''   ``The city's physical facilities are in disarray,'' financierFelix Rohatyn, who helped rescue the city from its 1970s' fiscalcrisis, said earlier this year. ``Many of our bridges are crumblingor unsafe; many of our school buildings are a disgrace; and many ofour streets would embarrass a Third World country.''   Welcome to the 1990s, Mayor Dinkins.   _ Crack and crime. ``They're inseparable,'' said ThomasReppetto, director of the Citizens Crime Commission. And they leadto clogged courtrooms and overcrowded jails.   In 1988, New York set records for murders (1,896) and violentcrime (162,916 murders, rapes, robberies and assaults). Fortypercent of the murders were drug related, Reppetto said.   In 1981, there were 26,000 arrests on drug charges; in 1988,about 90,000; this year it will be about 110,000, he said.   _ AIDS. More than 22,000 New Yorkers contracted AIDS; more than12,000 of them have died. About 200,000 are infected with the AIDSvirus, according to some estimates, though some say the numbercould be as high as 360,000.   ``It's going to be bad,'' said Carisa Cunningham of the GayMen's Health Crisis. ``There's a perception that it's slowed down,but that's not the case.''   By the end of 1991, there will be 40,000 AIDS cases; by 1993,60,000, the city Health Department estimates.   _ Health care. ``We're extremely strained in terms of capacityand in terms of financial difficulties,'' said Bruce Vladeck,president of the United Hospital Fund of New York, a research group.   ``That's all hospitals,'' he said, ``though city hospitals aretaking the particular brunt of the epidemics of AIDS and crack andrelated illnesses.''   New York City hospitals, public and private, average more than90 percent occupancy, he said. The national average is 60 percent.   Even if a 10-year, $2.1 billion capital plan for city hospitalswent ahead full steam _ which it won't, he said _ ``that willachieve less than two-thirds of the modernization that, it isagreed by everyone, is needed.''   _ The homeless. There are about 74,000 homeless in New York, thePartnership for the Homeless estimates. The number is growing byabout 7 percent annually, but could skyrocket in hard economictimes.   ``We did a reasonably decent job of addressing the families inwelfare hotels, but in meantime ignored the mushrooming number ofsingle adults _ the ones you see on the subways and on thestreets,'' said Peter Smith, partnership president.   Between 8,000 and 11,000 of the homeless are infected with theAIDS virus, and that could reach 30,000 by 1993 ``unless somethingdramatic is done,'' Smith said. ``Where's he going to get the moneyto do it?''   _ Race relations. Racially motivated killings of blacks havesent tremors through the city and marches by thousands of blackskept the issue in the forefront.   ``There are signals that people are trying to find their waythrough this wilderness,'' said the Rev. Herbert Daughtry, a civilrights leader. ``David Dinkins' election is one of those signs.   ``I'm going to hang up my marching shoes,'' Daughtry said. ``Imay not put them in bronze, but I'll put them up for a while.''   _ Money. Contracts for nearly all union municipal employees mustbe negotiated in the coming year. Each percentage point increase inpay equals $130 million for the total payroll, said Raymond Horton,president of the Citizens Budget Committee.   ``There's a problem, but not a crisis,'' Horton said. ``He canraise taxes, he can cut expenditures, or he can manage theresources the city already has more efficiently.   ``I would tell him to focus as much as possible onproductivity.''   But Rohatyn says ``it is quite likely that, in retrospect, theyears of the fiscal crisis of '75 to 1980 will appear benigncompared to what New York City is likely to face in the years 1990to 1995.''</TEXT></DOC>
