As connoisseurs of this artful dodging, we wish to draw attention to a congressional masterpiece.    Members of Congress, along with other top government officials, are about to receive pay raises ranging from 2.4% to 15.6%. The members would get $89,500 a year. Readers no doubt recall what has always happened in the recent past when Congress has attempted to raise its own pay. A hue and cry goes up at the prospect of facing the voters, and the proponents of the pay increase shrink away in embarrassment. There's no suppressing creative minds, however.    Congress designed this week's successful pay-increase process in 1985. Leery of what a federal advisory board on the issue called &quot;public outcry&quot; over such raises, Congress delegated the task of setting the salary levels of top officials to the president. With the executive branch increasingly finding it difficult to attract talented people into public service, Mr. Reagan proposed the pay increases (at levels below the advisory board's recommendations) in the budget he submitted Monday. To rescind these proposals, both houses of Congress must pass a joint resolution within 30 days. If Congress does nothing, the proposals become law. Members of Congress get a pay raise without ever having to vote for it.    Congress first learned the attractions of do-nothing legislating back in 1974, when it was tearing its hair out over Richard Nixon's repeated attempts to impound appropriated federal spending to get the budget under control. Congress fixed Mr. Nixon's wagon. It passed a law, still in effect, that says any presidential spending rescissions automatically expire, and the money has to be spent, if Congress fails to vote its approval. It's as if a boxer could win a match by failing to answer the bell. This game works because Congress makes up the rules.    To achieve the pay increases, Congress had to bring off a second clever maneuver. The pay proposals had to be submitted with the president's budget. Congressional leaders pressured the White House last year to deliver the president's budget request this past Monday rather than in early February, as has been the recent custom. Sending the package to Capitol Hill in early January means it will be nearly impossible for members of the barely organized 100th Congress to pull themselves together for a vote to cancel the pay hike before the 30-day clock runs out. It also cuts short the efforts of a grass-roots campaign by consumer activist Ralph Nader and New Right leader Paul Weyrich to mobilize public opposition to the pay raises.    It is true that the new pay schedules for Congress still don't bring members up in real terms to the pay levels they enjoyed in the late-1960s. And one look at Washington, D.C., real-estate ads will convince anyone that it costs a lot more to live there than in Austin or Omaha.    Our argument with Congress is not that the job of senator or representative isn't worth $89,500 a year, but that voters shouldn't have to give a raise to a group of people who demonstrate a consistent inability to perform necessary tasks, such as passing a federal budget on time. If the executives of a major corporation presided over a company with a rising tide of red ink, used archaic and unworkable accounting procedures and couldn't even get the company's product out on time, the last thing shareholders would vote for is a merit raise for top management.    Of course Congress knows this. That is why it is using a mechanism of dubious constitutionality -- so that members can tell their grumbling constituents, &quot;The president made me raise my pay!&quot; Many voters won't buy that, but they will lack a roll-call score card to sort out which side the players were on.    In 1932, during the Depression, Congress reduced the salaries of members by 10% to set an example for other government agencies whose budgets had to be cut. No one is asking the 100th Congress to take that kind of step, but is it too much to ask that Congress approve any pay raises with a roll-call vote, for which members are accountable?    Thomas Jefferson once warned of the &quot;spontaneous movement of the people&quot; that would punish members of Congress who voted themselves large pay raises &quot;or skulked from the vote.&quot; At the very least, the backdoor financing of this latest pay raise merits some sharp questioning the next time members fly home to make what they traditionally call a &quot;frank and candid&quot; report to the voters. </TEXT></DOC>
