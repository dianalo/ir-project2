Congress is about to express itselfon the crisis, just as the European Community continues topress foward with its own peace effort. For flouting theWest's hard-won standards of civilized international behaviorand then standing up to the West's proclaimed intention toenforce those standards, Saddam may soon be rewarded with aMiddle East peace conference, which would bestow on him astatus and legitimacy he does not now possess.   We don't doubt that the resolve of the President and hismen is, if anything, stronger than ever. Only yesterday, Mr.Bush broadcast via satellite to 127 countries a forceful andeloquent speech on the stakes in the Gulf.</LP><TEXT>   While it's clear that President Bush can stand up toSaddam Hussein, it's another kind of struggle altogether tostand up to the Western elites who help shape public supportfor the coalition against Iraq. Britain's leadership, ofcourse, has been a notable exception to the latest round ofquavering.   Our immediate concern is that Saddam will sense thefaltering mood in the West's capitals and in the middle ofthe congressional debate offer something approximatingreasonableness or a negotiated solution. The dynamics of theGulf crisis would change overnight. With only a gesture,Saddam likely would cause Congress, the Europeans and notleast the world media to bring overwhelming pressure onPresident Bush to stand down and start negotiating.   Once this process begins, the air will quickly run out ofthe armies in the Saudi desert and of the coalition thatsupports them. King Fahd and President Mubarak, who joinedthe U.S. because they recognized Saddam's intent todestabilize the whole region, would see that they had beencompromised. Indeed, any Middle East conference would becomea forum for Saddam to use the Israeli issue as a wedgebetween Arabs and the West. The purpose, of course, would notbe to help the Palestinians but to undermine the Saudis. Wedoubt the Saudis would be enthusiastic about such a phonypeace process, but what options would they have?   The Saudis and the Egyptians would also conclude that theWest's political establishment would tire of the talks andeventually conclude an agreement with Saddam that would leavehis military machine intact and ready to grow. Accordingly,it would be seen in the interests of a united Arab world tomake Israeli intransigence on the West Bank a primary focusof the comprehensive discussions. Intellectual opinion in theWest would support this new anti-Israeli focus; it has doneso for years. And the Kuwaitis, dispersed and in exile, wouldhave about as much role in the negotiations set piece as theSouth Vietnamese had in theirs.   This scenario may seem dour, but we can't imagine whatother outcome the &quot;peaceful alternative&quot; crowd could have inmind. In point of fact, the &quot;peace&quot; now being pursued by theEuropean Community or Francois Mitterrand's emissary toBaghdad would be a false peace.   At worst it would be a peace made by Europeans seeking toprotect their commercial interests in the region, includingthe sale of arms such as the Exocet missile Saddam used tohit the USS Stark. At best it would be peace made by men whobelieve that the use of their own armies is a greater moralevil than negotiating &quot;peace&quot; with a man whose troops madewar crimes standard procedure in Kuwait, who bombed his ownpeople with poison gas and who has bought or stolen theWest's technology to assemble an arsenal of nuclear, chemicaland biological weapons to complement his army of one millionmen.   While one might expect the negotiations solution to beespoused by bishops or the president of France, it is harderto account for the extraordinary timidity of some Americanpoliticians. Surely most of them recognize that the continuedreign of Saddam Hussein is a formula for endless mischiefand, eventually, a war involving the U.S.   Iraq is quite literally a pirate nation; in no sense anormal nation, its existence now depends on its ability toconduct war. Left to its own devices, it will in time engageIsrael, Saudi Arabia or even Iran in another major conflict.   Is the West, with every subsequent Iraqi thrust, trulygoing to negotiate another -- and then another -- &quot;peacefulsettlement&quot; with Saddam? This is folly, but with only a weekremaining until the United Nations' January 15 deadline,President Bush is still standing almost alone in his owncountry opposing the folly of a false and dangerous peace.   The talk now is of taking a deal if offered, of rewardingSaddam Hussein for wrecking and then mocking the foundationsof a genuine international peace.</TEXT></DOC>
