Minister Michel Delebarre said in a statement that a preliminaryreport submitted Thursday by an investigating commission revealed``no failure of the aircraft or its equipment.'' The plane, hesaid, followed all the orders provided by the crew.   The computerized A320 is the latest Airbus model. The company, aEuropean consortium, says it is the fastest selling commercialplane in history.   In the June 26 accident near Mulhouse, the plane failed to comeout of a low pass, struck the tops of trees near a runway andcrashed into a forest.   Delebarre criticized the state-run airline Air France, operatorof the plane, for the ``inadmissible conditions'' of the aircraft'sparticipation and mission at the airshow.   He said he was suspending the two crew members because of``elements about the circumstances of the flight exposed by thecommission investigating the accident.'' There was no elaborationon either point.   There have been conflicting reports about the altitude of theplane at the time of the accident. The pilot has testified hisinstruments showed the plane was flying at about 90 feet, butsources quoted investigators as saying the plane was at 30 feet.   Examining Magistrate Charles Bertin said the minister's decisiondoes not influence a judicial investigation of the accident stillunder way.   ``It is purely an internal sanction,'' the French news agencyAgence France-Presse quoted Bertin as saying. ``It does not at allmean that the two pilots will be charged for penal infractions.''   Bertin, who is in charge of the judicial probe, added: ``Thismeasure has nothing to do with judicial decisions which couldeventually be taken.''</TEXT></DOC>
