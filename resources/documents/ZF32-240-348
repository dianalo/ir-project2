(Hewlett-Packarddeveloping fast laser printer for local area networks)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Damore, Kelley.andM;</AUTHOR><SUMMARY>HP is reportedly developing a 17-page-per-minute version of itsLaserJet III printer designed for high-volume use on local areanetworks (LANs).andP;  The new LaserJet IIIsi will print at 300dots-per-inch and is expected to sell for $5,200.andP;  It will comewith a choice of a Token-Ring or Ethernet module for connectingthe printer as a standalone network node and will come with atleast 2Mbytes of RAM as well as a 500-page cut feeder.andP;  Somespeculate that HP will offer a reduced instruction set computingprocessor and true Adobe PostScript compatibility in a laterversion.andP;  Industry observers note that key requirements for anetwork-capable printer are a heavy duty cycle, good paperhandling capabilities and the ability to switch between multipleenvironments on the fly.andP;  A printer that is a standalone networknode is available constantly to all LAN users without having toshare processor time with each microcomputer.andM;</SUMMARY><DESCRIPT>Company:   Hewlett-Packard Co.

(HP) is readying a 17-page-per-minute laser printer forrelease in the first quarter, according to sources close to the company.andM;The 300-dot-per-inch LaserJet IIIsi, expected to carry a retail price of$5,200, will offer users a choice of an Ethernet or Token-Ring module forconnecting the printer to a LAN as a stand-alone node, the sources said.andP;  HPcurrently offers add-on Ethernet and Token-Ring connections priced at $949and $995, respectively, for its LaserJet II and III printers.andM;The new printer is expected to come with a 500-page cut feeder and at least2M bytes of RAM; sources familiar with the company's plans said the printer'smemory could be expandable.andP;  In addition, a later version of the printercould include a RISC processor and true PostScript compatibility, they said.andM;A networkable printer needs to meet certain requirements, according toJonathan Seybold, president of Seybold Seminars in Malibu, Calif.andM;&quot;andlsqb;A networkable printerandrsqb; ideally needs a heavy-duty cycle and goodpaper-handling capabilities,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;In addition, the printer needson-the-fly switching between multiple andlsqb;environmentsandrsqb; as well as a networkinterface.andP;  These capabilities should be transparent to the user.&quot;andM;Industry observers said that allowing the printer to connect directly to anetwork would be a big plus.andM;&quot;As a stand-alone node, the printer is available all the time.andP;  In addition,the printer does not have to share time with the processor of the PC, whichcould slow down performance,&quot; said Bill Gott, senior industry analyst atInfoCorp, a market-research firm in Santa Clara, Calif.andM;&quot;In a typical environment, the printer would have to be connected to the fileserver or workstation, and this involves additional software.andP;  Having theprinter as a node is far more convenient,&quot; said Mark Cuban, president ofMicroSolutions Inc., a systems dealer based in Dallas.andM;Users, however, differed on whether the LAN option is attractive, consideringHP's expected pricing structure.andM;&quot;The LaserJet II is a nice printer.andP;  For about $2,100 I would prefer to buytwo andlsqb;LaserJet IIsandrsqb; rather than one 16-page-per-minute LaserJet andlsqb;IIIsiandrsqb;,&quot; saidDavid Waters, an application development manager for Sprint UnitedInformation Services in Kansas City, Mo.andM;&quot;Higher-speed, networkable printers are not all that they are cracked up tobe,&quot; said Mike Wyatt, a senior engineering fellow at Honeywell Inc. inClearwater, Fla.andM;&quot;The main problem is that you can have different people's output clashing andprinting on the same page.&quot;andM;Linda Wood, an information systems analyst for BayBank Systems in Waltham,Mass., disagreed.andM;&quot;We would find the LaserJet IIIsi an attractive option.andP;  We are putting moreLANs in different departments, and having the printer as a node would free upthe file server for other tasks,&quot; she said.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
