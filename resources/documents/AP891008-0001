WILSON</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>PISA, Italy (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The tower of Pisa has been leaning for 800years, so the keeper of the marble wonder can't understand what allthe latest fuss is about.   It's true that experts have been making dire predictions foryears. But there was a real tower tizzy after the minister ofpublic works, Giovanni Prandini, sounded an alarm recently thatscared all of Italy.   Newspapers immediately published headlines warning of a ``redalert'' for the tower, raising fears that one of the symbols ofItaly could, at worst, topple, or at best, be closed for repairs.   But Giuseppe Toniolo, chairman of the committee responsible forpreservation of the monument, says there's nothing to get excitedabout.   ``There is absolutely nothing new in the situation,'' he said inan interview. ``To say that the tower is in danger, so what? It'salways been in danger.''   ``What does the tower need?'' Toniolo added. ``It needs to beleft in peace.''   The 180-foot circular tower, begun by Bonnano Pisano in 1173,started to tilt almost immediately because the ground shiftedunderneath. It was completed by Tomasso d'Andrea with theconstruction of the belfry between 1360 and 1370.   The tower now leans about 13 feet off the perpendicular, butToniolo and other tower experts say it would not topple for morethan another century if it continues to tilt at its average rate.   According to the last measurement in June, the tower leaned anadditional 0.008 inches in the last 12-month period. The averageyearly tilt since the measurements began in 1918 is 0.047 inches.   ``The thing should fall over,'' Toniolo said, seated behind adesk in his office, the tower visible through Gothic windows. ``Howlong will this lean last? No one can say. But at a certain time, itwill reach the point where it falls. That will take more than 100years. It could be 200, 250 years.''   For decades, Italy has tried to come up with ways to save thetower. A number of national and international commissions haveproposed plans for stabilizing the monument, but none has ever beenimplemented.   ``The problem of trying to stabilize the tower is enough to makethe hands of great technicians tremble,'' said Gero Geri, atopography professor who has been measuring the lean of the towersince 1969. ``Who wants to risk doing something that could upsetthe equilibrium?''   The latest plan, approved by the government in 1987, is toimplant a wheel-shaped support below the base around the tower. Itwould be connected by concrete spokes to the marble foundation.   The Public Works Ministry appointed a commission a few monthsago to study the soil conditions to determine whether the plan cango ahead.   But Toniolo believes the tower can't be fixed until officialsfigure out what has kept the 14,000-ton structure standing allthese years.   ``All the technicians say it can't be understood,'' said thewhite-haired, 80-year-old retired radiologist who has headed themonument preservation committee for 12 years. ``This means thereare special conditions of the terrain which haven't yet beenexplained. If you can't understand this, how can you do a projectto save it?''   Prandini, a Christian Democrat who has been public worksminister for barely two months, apparently wants to find a solution.   After expressing his concern over the state of the tower,Prandini ordered a panel of technical experts to report backquickly on the feasibility of a stabilization plan. He also toldthem to devise a round-the-clock monitoring system for the tower.   Mayor Giacomino Granchi, a Socialist, accused Prandini ofexaggerating the situation and trying to get publicity for himself.   Prandini replied, ``I don't see why one wants to make acontroversy out of a well known problem only because there's thewill to act decisively and go from the study phase to concreterealization.''   The sense of urgency was heightened by the collapse in March ofthe 900-year-old tower of Pavia in northern Italy, killing threepeople. Experts said the 255-foot tower crumbled either because ofnatural decay in the mortar holding the bricks together or becauseof a sudden sinking following a dry spell that lowered the watertable.   ``The example of Pavia doesn't count because no one evermonitored it,'' Toniolo said. ``No other tower in Italy ismonitored like Pisa's. If Pavia had all the instruments that wehave, they would have known a few months before'' that it was indanger.   Toniolo said he receives an average of 40 proposals a year frompeople around the world, mostly Americans, for saving the tower.   The latest: erecting a huge statue of Saint Ranieri, Pisa'spatron saint, with arms raised to hold up the tower.   Some even suggest trying to straighten the tower, a notion thatmakes Toniolo shudder.   ``Never, for heaven's sake,'' he said. ``It was born tilted. Ourancestors built it that way eight centuries ago. It must remainthat way.''</TEXT></DOC>
