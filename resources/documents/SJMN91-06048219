I recall that about 10 yearsago you printed an essay on this subject. Father Theodore Hesburgh, presidentof the University of Notre Dame, sent it to you.;    It would mean a lot to meif you could find it and run it again.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Living  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  ANSWER TO ANTI-SEMITES  </HEADLINE><TEXT>  -- H.L., Los Angeles;    DEAR H.L. -- That column appeared in July 1981. Theessay was written by Sam Levinson. He called it &quot;An Answer to an Anti-Semite.&quot;Here is an updated version. The research was done by David Gaus, a student atTulane University Medical School in New Orleans.;    &quot;It's a free world. Youdon't have to like Jews if you don't want to, but if you are going to be ananti-Semite you should be consistent and turn your back on the medicaladvances that Jews made possible.;    &quot;I am talking about the vaccine forhepatitis discovered by Baruch Blumberg, the Wasserman test for syphilisdeveloped by August Von Wasserman, and the first effective drug to fightsyphilis developed by Paul Ehrlich. Bela Schick developed the diagnostic skintest for diphtheria. Insulin would not have been discovered if Oskar Minkowskihad not demonstrated the link between diabetes and the pancreas. It was BurillCrohn who identified the disease that bears his name. Alfred Hess discoveredthat vitamin C could cure scurvy. Casimir Funk was the first to use vitamin Bto treat beriberi. Jonas Salk developed the first polio vaccine, and later,Albert Sabin developed the oral version.;    &quot;Humanitarianism requires that weoffer these gifts to all people of the world, regardless of race, color orcreed. So the anti-Semites who don't want to accept these gifts can go aheadand turn them down, but I'm warning you, you aren't going to feel so good.&quot;;   DEAR ANN LANDERS -- Once again you have printed a letter from a woman whocomplained about her husband's &quot;dead battery.&quot; Since your readers have beenuncharacteristically silent on a subject I thought would bring them out by thethousands, it's up to me to speak out.;    Some of those &quot;dead batteries&quot;aren't dead at all. With a little recharging they could be as good as new. Iam a 66-year-old man who has a faithful, loving wife. My battery sometimesgets a bit sluggish but that is to be expected at my time of life. One thing Ido NOT do is look outside of my marriage for a jump start. This can bedangerous. If the cables get crossed, you could be in for big trouble.;    Iknow of no battery that comes with a lifetime guarantee, nor do I know of abattery that will last forever. So my advice is read this letter carefully --as many times as it takes for the contents to soak in -- and pay attention tothe message.; -- Bob J. in Northern Texas;    DEAR BOB -- Thanks for your highvoltage reply. I got a charge out of the metaphors and agree with your counsel.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Ann Landers column  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910217  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Sunday  </DAY><MONTH>  February  </MONTH><PG.COL>  2L  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  518  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Sunday February 17, 199100048219,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
