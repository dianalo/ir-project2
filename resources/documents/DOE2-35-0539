The presence of an underlying smooth nonthermal base-diskcomponent of the radio-continuum emission in M51 is confirmed; this componenthas a morphology similar to the old disk stars in the galaxy. The thermalradio emission in M51 correlates well with the optical H-alpha emissionfrom the giant H II complexes. There is no evidence that similar complexesare present but hidden in the dust. It is confirmed that the ridges inthe nonthermal radio emission correspond closely with the dust lanesalong major portions of the spiral arms in M51. A number of featuresnot previously recognized are described. Near the dust lane there isevidence that the cool-cloud component appears to separate kinematicallyfrom the component in which the nonthermal radio emission is embedded.24 references.</TEXT></DOC>
