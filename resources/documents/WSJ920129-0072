And why not? The 50-50 specialty chemicals venture withDow Chemical Co. contributed 27% of Corning's record 1991earnings. In one review, Corning Chairman James R. Houghtoncalled Dow Corning a &quot;classic example&quot; of how to &quot;speedCorning technology into the marketplace.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   But these days, Corning's darling is a prodigal son. &quot;Wedon't comment&quot; on separate companies, a spokesman says.   Dow Corning's breast implant debacle is shaping up to bethe biggest potential litigation and public relationsnightmare of Corning's 141-year history. The Corning name,once known for the squeaky-clean and well-managed companythat made casserole dishes, Pyrex beakers and medicalequipment, now is associated with faulty breast implants thatallegedly cause immune disorders and skin disease.   As angry women and product liability lawyers swarm to suethe Midland, Mich., venture for allegedly rushing theimplants to market without adequate testing, Corning's stockhas plunged from a 52-week high of $86.25 just a month ago toyesterday's close of $60.625 on the New York Stock Exchange.   Corning officials insist the collapse isn't justified.However, the incident shows how vulnerable a successfulcompany is to a questionable product that's associated withits name.   To be sure, the jury is still out on whether siliconebreast implants are unsafe. Just this week, Britain's chiefmedical officer issued a statement saying they are safe; butthe U.S. Food and Drug Administration has temporarily bannedthe implants. It meets next month to decide whether to makethe ban permanent.   The question now hovering over Corning is whether it isliable for Dow Corning's alleged misdeeds. That hinges on onekey issue: Does it or can it control Dow Corning? &quot;Or arethey funding it hoping for the best?&quot; asks Minneapolisattorney Bruce A. Finzen, whose firm litigated Union CarbideCorp.'s Bhopal, India, chemical disaster on behalf of theIndian government.   Corning clearly has a hand in Dow Corning's business.Besides owning half of the company, it has fiverepresentatives among the 14 members of Dow Corning's board,including Corning Chairman Houghton. (Dow Chemical also hasfive representatives on the board, while Dow Corning itselfhas four.)   Company literature also points to a research overlap. InCorning's 1990 annual report, Chairman Houghton said DowCorning was formed in 1943 to &quot;market the silicones createdin a Corning laboratory.&quot; A Corning spokesman says the 1940smarked the first and last time the two companies sharedresearch. Currently, &quot;we do not share our research withthem,&quot; he notes.   Thomas Talcott, a materials engineer who worked for DowCorning for 24 years before resigning over the breast implantissue, agrees that Corning wasn't involved in the developmentof the implants. &quot;I don't think they had any involvement,&quot;Mr. Talcott says, adding that his doubts about the implantsnever reached the board. &quot;I think what the board of directorsheard was, things are going great.&quot;   If courts agree, that could protect Corning. Mr. Finzensays Union Carbide was deemed culpable in its Indiansubsidiary's disaster at Bhopal partly because Union Carbidedesigned the plant from which poisonous gas leaked in 1984,killing or injuring thousands of people in the area, and ittrained Bhopal workers at Union Carbide facilities in WestVirginia.   But even if Corning isn't liable for its joint venture'spotential damages, the Corning, N.Y., company stands to losea big chunk of earnings if Dow Corning suffers. Last year,Dow Corning contributed 27% of corporate earnings, down from28.3% the year before and 30.3% in 1989.   That thinking caused investors to stampede out of Corningstock a month ago when it was trading in the mid-$80 range.But now that the stock is trading around $60, analysts arerecommending the stock. Corning &quot;is attractive even under aworst-case scenario&quot; of a Dow Corning bankruptcy, saysPrudential Securities analyst B. Alex Henderson, who onMonday changed his recommendation on the stock to &quot;buy&quot; from&quot;hold.&quot;   Wall Street's faith is based on Corning's mix ofprofitable businesses, including medical testing and opticalfiber, which is being used to replace copper wire intelephone lines. These businesses have been growing while DowCorning's contributions are shrinking, says PaineWebber Inc.analyst Kim Ritrievi.   Meanwhile, Corning's image has been tarnished. One companymanager, who asks not to be identified, says that he is oftenmistaken for a Dow Corning employee when he travels. &quot;A lotof people have that problem,&quot; he says.   The confusion partly arises from Corning's ringing silenceon how it has been affected by Dow Corning's problems. Mr.Houghton, who is usually accessible, has declined to comment.His only public statement was in a Jan. 14 press release, inwhich he complained that Corning stock's 10-point drop theprevious day was a &quot;gross overreaction.&quot;   Crisis management experts are dubious of Corning's publicrelations strategy. &quot;They're saying, `Gee, we don't have aproblem. Let's stick our head in the sand. Maybe it will goaway,'&quot; says Norman L. Harris, editor of Crisis magazine,Columbus, Ohio. Corning may want to avoid liability by notcommenting on Dow Corning's business, but it should commenton whether its investment in Dow Corning is safe, Mr. Harrissays.   ---                   Corning by the Numbers                                                                                                                            The Fundamentals                                                                                                                                               1990      1989                                                                                                          SALES ($ billions)                  $2.04     $2.44   NET INCOME ($ millions)              $292      $261   EARNINGS PER SHARE                  $3.10     $2.80                                                                                                          MAJOR PRODUCT LINES:                                                                                                          Celcor ceramic cores for catalytic converters; Siecoroptical fiber cable; Corning Ware, Visions and Corellecookware; Steuben crystal; Serengeti sunglasses.
