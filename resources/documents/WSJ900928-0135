Windows is expanding the domain of Microsoft whileconstraining the growth of Lotus Development Corp. andWordPerfect Corp., currently the two largest applicationssuppliers.</LP><TEXT>   Microsoft's Windows program adds a set of graphicalcommands to DOS, the basic software that controls theoperations of International Business Machines Co.'s personalcomputers and compatibles. Instead of controllingapplications through keystrokes and strings of letters, usersof Windows can choose commands from menus and point at iconsto launch operations, such as a picture of scissors standingfor a command to delete information. However, newapplications -- such as spreadsheets or word processingprograms -- are required to take full advantage of Windows.   Lotus and WordPerfect were caught without their flagshipproducts tailored to the new version of Windows whenMicrosoft introduced it in May. Now they are starting to paya price as sales of both Windows and Microsoft's applicationsfor it are taking off.   &quot;They're losing some of the new market for applicationsbecause they didn't realize how important Windows would be orhow quickly it would catch on,&quot; said Andrew Seybold, ananalyst at Dataquest Inc., a market researcher. Both Lotusand WordPerfect say they'll ship Windows versions of theirmost popular applications in the first half of next year.   WordPerfect, which supplies the most popular DOS wordprocessing program, acknowledges that it is losing businessbecause it lacks a Windows version of its word-processingprogram. &quot;Windows is taking away incremental growth we wouldhave had through the end of the year,&quot; said Willard E.Peterson, executive vice president at WordPerfect, a closelyheld firm that expects $425 million in revenue this year.   Mr. Peterson added that he believes he can regain lostshare with a solid Windows product next year, but &quot;if weshould do a bad job, our sales will level off or drift down.&quot;   Lotus, which has a networking product called Notes butnone of its popular spreadsheets on Windows, said it is toosoon to gauge the effect of Windows on its business. But JimManzi, Lotus's chief executive officer, said &quot;getting out ourWindows applications is the most important project at thecompany.&quot;   Other software suppliers without Windows applications alsoare feeling the pressure.   &quot;It's very clear that every major account is evaluatingWindows, and they've all called me in to explain my Windowsstrategy,&quot; said Fred Gibbons, chief executive officer atSoftware Publishing Corp.   Mr. Gibbons said his concern, one of the 10 largestsuppliers of PC software, plans in its coming fiscal year tospend more money on Windows development than any otherapplications projects. In the year ending Sunday, the companyspent virtually nothing on Windows development.   With interest in Windows running high, companies thatoffer Windows applications are drawing buy-out offers fromlarger competitors. Earlier this year, for instance, Mr.Gibbons offered to acquire Micrografx Inc., which suppliestwo Windows graphics programs, for $80 million in stock,according to J. Paul Grayson, Micrografx's chairman. Mr.Grayson said he refused the offer and his firm latercompleted a public stock offering. Mr. Gibbons declined tocomment.   Some customers are so enthusiastic about Windows thatthey've even stopped entertaining sales pitches from softwarecompanies that don't offer Windows applications.   &quot;If a company doesn't have any Windows applications, Idon't even want them to visit,&quot; said Darrell Owen, who headsan office automation group for the Bonneville PowerAdministration in Portland, Ore. Mr. Owen said he recentlyrefused to see salespeople from Lotus and Ashton-Tate becauseneither were peddling Windows applications.   Prospects for a sea-change in the word processing andspreadsheet markets -- the two biggest in PC applications --isn't likely, however, provided Lotus, WordPerfect and othersuppliers of popular DOS applications can quickly deliverWindows versions of their products. Most customers say theydon't want to abandon products with huge followings, but &quot;theday will come when we will switch vendors if Windowsapplications aren't available,&quot; warns Sheldon Laube, nationaldirector of information and technology at Price Waterhouse.   A new study by International Data Corp. underscores this.In a poll of 200 corporate PC users, the company found thatmore than 60% plan to buy both word processing andspreadsheet software tailored to Windows.   In the meantime, Microsoft hopes to expand its ownapplications business, which in recent years has grown morerapidly than its bread-and-butter operating softwarebusiness. William Gates, Microsoft's chief executive, saidthe company posted &quot;a significant increase&quot; in applicationssales in July and August, and he hopes to increase thepressure on competitors next week by offering a bundle ofthree Microsoft Windows applications at a 50% discount.   Prior to the introduction of the new Windows version inMay, many Microsoft competitors were skeptical about itsprospects, asserting that OS/2 would emerge as a strongeralternative. But in the past four months, Microsoft hasshipped more than one million copies of Windows while OS/2,another Microsoft operating system, flounders. Last week,IBM, one of the staunchest advocates of OS/2, even agreed tolicense Windows.</TEXT></DOC>
