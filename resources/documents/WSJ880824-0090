You might get it.&quot;    This old saying is getting quite a workout here as Israeli and U.S. officials grapple with the prospect of a new-style Palestine Liberation Organization.    For decades, Israel and the U.S. have called on the PLO to renounce terrorism and recognize Israel. Nine months into Israel's Palestinian uprising and 10 weeks from Israel's general election, the rumor among influential Palestinians on the West Bank and elsewhere is that PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat is indeed moving toward recognition of Israel, probably in a September speech to the United Nations.    If Mr. Arafat arrives at the U.N. -- this time without the empty pistol-holster he wore in 1974 -- and makes an unambiguous statement of recognition along the lines the U.S. has demanded since 1975, Washington will have little choice but to open a dialogue and urge Israel to do likewise.    The thought of this, and the political risks it entails, is enough to give presidential candidates nightmares. But ambiguity is the PLO's stock-in-trade, and U.S. officials aren't sweating yet. What is most likely, senior analysts say, is a vague statement that allows doves to hear recognition and hawks to hear rejection.    For many Israelis, hating the PLO for its years of terror and duplicity, even a speech of sparkling clarity, delivered in words of one syllable, won't assuage their suspicions. And, Catch-22, therein lies the snag that may forestall Mr. Arafat's ability to speak with clarity. The biggest risk he runs is to give the Israelis exactly what they have so long demanded and then to have the Israelis give him nothing to show his people in return.    The PLO launched a trial balloon on recognition of Israel at June's Arab summit in Algiers, in a document calling for mutual recognition and cooperation for the sake of &quot;our children and the children of the Israelis.&quot;    While the document drew condemnation from extreme PLO factions outside the occupied territories, Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza didn't repudiate it. Indeed, interviews with scores of Palestinians, from refugee youths to university professors, reveal an overwhelming majority in favor of recognition.    Those voices must be heard by an outside leadership that wants to retain both its credibility in the occupied lands and some of the credit for the struggle being waged there. And, indeed, the past few days have seen a flurry of statements by senior PLO officials seemingly paving the way for recognition.    This thaw in the PLO's position was accelerated by Jordan's King Hussein. His sudden renunciation of West Bank sovereignty late last month made the PLO the new address for any peace initiatives, and created great confusion among Israelis as they hurtled toward elections.    Israel's Labor Party, with a peace plank firmly resting on a &quot;Jordanian option,&quot; found its platform suddenly turned to rubber. An attempt to redraft its policy resulted in wording so murky that few can agree if the party means to accept negotiations with the PLO under certain circumstance or not.    The more-hawkish Likud bloc, meanwhile, has its own debate. Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir maintains that the king's move changes nothing and Israel's only response should be to build more Jewish settlements on the West Bank. But his influential trade minister, Ariel Sharon, has launched what amounts to a separate campaign, vigorously advocating annexation of almost all the West Bank.    Meanwhile, the uprising has spread from the occupied West Bank and Gaza into Israel's cities and suburbs. In separate incidents in the past few weeks, Israelis are being held in connection with the burning to death of three Palestinian laborers as they slept near a building site near Tel Aviv. Abu Nidal's PLO faction has claimed responsibility for a grenade attack at a Haifa cafe that wounded 25 Israelis, and two Palestinian workers were badly beaten by Israeli youths in attacks in Tel Aviv. </TEXT></DOC>
