Many reasons account for the shift overseas, butprimarily, it is that the Gulf contains mostly natural gas,not oil, and a stunning and unexpected drop in gas pricesthis year forced many companies to curb gas projects.</LP><TEXT>   The rigs that are leaving the U.S. are, increasingly, notheaded to some traditional reserves-rich countries. Becauseof the Persian Gulf crisis, companies have developed agreater appetite to find secure oil supplies outside of theMiddle East. In addition, Iraqi and Kuwaiti oil is nowexpected to take longer to come back to the market than manypeople expected. Also, the Soviet Union's exports havedeclined.   &quot;Other countries are trying to pick up the slack,&quot;including Venezuela and Nigeria, said Robert McWilliams, vicepresident of oil-rig company Rowan Cos. of Houston. He wasspeaking at an energy conference here sponsored by thesecurities firm Howard, Weil, Labouisse, Friedrichs Inc.   &quot;We've aggressively increased our exploration acreageoverseas,&quot; said Paul Hoenmans, executive vice president ofMobil Corp., based in Fairfax, Va. Phillips Petroleum Co.plans to spend more than half its $640 million explorationand production budget this year outside the U.S. &quot;By themid-90s we'll see 65% to 70% of our spending in foreignareas,&quot; said Glenn Cox, president of that Bartlesville,Okla., oil company.   Geology also drives companies out of U.S. waters. &quot;If youwant to find new oil, the big reserves just aren't in theU.S.,&quot; said James Payne, president of Santa Fe EnergyResources Inc. of Houston. Independents like Santa Fe, hadaccounted for a pickup in Gulf of Mexico drilling activitybut even these smaller companies are thinkinginternationally. &quot;If you're going to be a long-range playeryou have to go overseas,&quot; Mr. Payne said. The company islooking closely at Argentina.   Service companies are following the oil companies out ofthe Gulf of Mexico to international waters where demand andprices are higher. Since the beginning of the year, around adozen drilling rigs have left for overseas waters and anotherdozen could leave by summer, drillers said. There arecurrently 128 rigs working in the Gulf of Mexico, down from151 a year ago, while the number of rigs under contract ininternational waters has risen to 415 from 387, according tofigures compiled by Offshore Data Services Inc.   &quot;The Gulf has gotten ugly,&quot; said William Chiles, presidentof Houston's Chiles Offshore Inc. A Chiles drilling rig leftthe Gulf of Mexico a month ago to work for a Shell Oil Co.unit in Trinidad. Chiles will receive $35,000 a day for therig compared with the $12,000 a day it was earning in theGulf. Another Chiles rig is headed to Nigeria for Texaco Inc.and will receive a day rate of at least $10,000 more than inthe Gulf.   Tidewater Inc., the largest operator of oil-service boatsin the Gulf of Mexico, now has 57% of its fleet outside theU.S., and the shift has occurred in the past half-year, saidJohn LaBorde, chairman of the New Orleans company. A typicalsupply vessel can fetch several hundred dollars more than the$2,800 a day it charges in the Gulf.   Indeed, the evacuation sparked price cutting for equipmentthat remains in the Gulf of Mexico. &quot;In the last 60 to 90days that market has tipped over,&quot; said Russell Luigs,chairman of drilling contractor Global Marine Inc. ofHouston. Day rates for boats in December were $3,000. Bidsfor new jobs are now at $2,600 a day, said Mr. LaBorde.   The price war is more vicious for drilling rigs,particularly at the low end of equipment. Rowan has slashedrates on some rigs to $8,250 a day, several thousand dollarsbelow what that kind of equipment fetched several months ago.Said C. Robert Palmer, chairman of Rowan, &quot;If a price war iswhat's wanted a price war we'll give 'em.&quot;   Of course, with so much metal leaving the Gulf of Mexico,the availability of equipment could tighten and drive upprices later this year. Forrest Hoglund, chairman of EnronOil andamp; Gas Co., Houston, said that even though the company hascut spending plans 15% this year to $240 million, &quot;the waycosts are coming down we may not have to cut back.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
