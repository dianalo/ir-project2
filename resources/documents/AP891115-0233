Paramount said Tuesday that as a result its publishingoperations, which include Simon andamp; Schuster, Prentice Hall andPocket Books, will report a break-even performance for the yearended Oct. 31.   The charge reflects a writedown in the value of some publishingassets and accruals for costs associated with improving publishingtechnology.   Despite the charge, the company's overall results are expectedto be sharply higher. It previously announced a $1.2 billionafter-tax gain on the sale of its consumer and commercial financebusiness and a $12 million after-tax gain on the sale of two smallPrentice Hall units.   Paramount earned $384.7 million, or $3.21 a share, on revenue of$5.1 billion in fiscal 1988.   In late trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Paramount wasoff $2.12{ a share at $54.   ``The publishing side is not doing as well as I thought it wouldbe in the summer,'' said Andrew Wallach, who follows Paramount forthe investment firm Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.   But he said it is not unusual for a company to take charges whenit is also taking big one-time gains.   Martin S. Davis, Paramount's chairman and chief executive, said,``The charge against publishing earnings reflects changes in themarketplace affecting the entire industry, such as sharply risingproduct development and marketing costs and shorter revisionperiods for textbooks.''   He said the fundamentals of Paramount's publishing businesseswere ``extremely sound'' and should continue to represent animportant source of earnings and cash flow.   ``We are confident that fiscal 1990 results will showsignificant improvement and provide a solid base for growth in thedecade of the 1990s and beyond,'' he said.   Paramount previously announced that it expects to take an $80million charge for the costs of its failed bid for Time.   Time rejected Paramount's $12 billion takeover offer, boughtcontrolling interest in Warner Communications Inc. and changed itsname to Time Warner Inc. Time Warner expects to buy the remainingWarner shares later this year.   Counting both the publishing charge and the charge related tothe failed buyout bid, Paramount said it expects little change inits earnings from continuing operations for fiscal 1989 rcomparedwith $147.8 million, or $1.23 a share, in fiscal 1988.</TEXT></DOC>
