(AP)  </DATELINE><TEXT>   A former E.F. Hutton andamp; Co. broker was sentenced Friday to three months in prison and fined $3,000 for his part in a money-laundering scheme at the firm's local branch.    Brian J. Lareau, 46 years old, could have been sentenced to six years in prison and fined $6,000. Under a plea bargain, prosecutors had recommended no more than six months in prison.    The sentence imposed by U.S. District Judge Francis J. Boyle also calls for Mr. Lareau to perform 200 hours of public service for one count of violating the Social Security Act. Judge Boyle also sentenced the Jamestown resident to two years of probation for one count of money-laundering.    Mr. Lareau admitted laundering $183,950 from August 1982 to October 1984. He worked at Hutton's Providence branch from 1980 to 1985. The illegal activity occurred before Hutton's acquisition last year by Shearson Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., which has since changed its name to Shearson Lehman Hutton Holdings Inc., New York. Shearson is a unit of American Express Co., New York.    According to court documents, Mr. Lareau created a fictitious account with a fake Social Security number and used it to conceal a customer's money. Another former Hutton broker, Stephen S. Fusco, was accused of helping organized-crime figures launder illegal profits.    Authorities said Mr. Lareau and Mr. Fusco, who has since died, helped clients hide about $1.5 million in cash from the Internal Revenue Service and the Securities and Exchange Commission.    The Social Security count against Mr. Lareau is a felony, punishable by maximum penalties of five years in prison and $6,000 in fines.    The money-laundering count is a misdemeanor with a maximum penalty of a year in prison. It is a felony only if more than $100,000 is laundered in any 12-month period, and authorities said Mr. Lareau never laundered more than $99,000 in any one-year period.    Mr. Lareau will begin serving his sentence Aug. 16.    Hutton pleaded guilty May 16 to money-laundering and conspiracy and was fined $1 million for its part in the scheme. The fine was the largest ever imposed in a money-laundering case. </TEXT></DOC>
