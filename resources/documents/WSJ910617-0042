While the initial public offering looks tempting toshort-term traders, some long-term investors say they prefertwo rival companies, Shell Canada and Imperial Oil.</LP><TEXT>   About 35 million shares of Canada's second-largest oil andgas company are expected to be offered at as little as 15Canadian dollars apiece (US$13.12), a 45% discount to whatsome analysts figure is Petro-Canada's net asset value.Underwriters have been pitching the low price to drum upsupport for the offering. It could be priced as early as thisafternoon to raise as much as C$600 million.   Pierre Panet-Raymond, a Toronto investor, says he will buyPetro-Canada shares if they are priced &quot;appropriately&quot; atless than C$15. His goal is to make a quick buck by resellingthem immediately. &quot;This IPO is great for folks who want toflip stocks rather than for the long-term investor,&quot; he says.   With 25% of the offering earmarked for U.S. and Europeaninvestors, and preference given to investors seeking fewerthan 250 shares, Mr. Panet-Raymond and others are bettingthat institutions will drive up the price in the first fewdays as they seek to bolster their holdings of scarceCanadian big-company stocks.   Perhaps. But one long-term investor who won't be buying isStephen Jarislowsky. His Montreal investment fund managmentfirm, Jarislowsky Fraser, looked at Petro-Canada and decidedto pass. &quot;It may be priced so cheap that somebody can make aquick buck, but so what,&quot; Mr. Jarislowsky says. &quot;Imperial isfar more attractive to us, or Shell. We don't know how wellPetro-Can will do.&quot;   Petro-Canada has lined up so many brokerage firms asunderwriters that it's hard to find one that isn't&quot;restricted&quot; from discussing the company. But it clearlyhasn't lost its free-spending image, acquired during a decadein which Petro-Canada served as an instrument of former PrimeMinister Pierre Trudeau's nationalist energy policy. Then,its mandate was to find and develop oil and gas reserves toensure Canada's energy security, regardless of cost.   Since 1985 and the advent of a Progressive Conservativegovernment, Petro-Canada has been instructed to operate as anormal commercial enterprise, paving the way forprivatization. Yet critics say Petro-Canada is still betterat spending cash than at generating it. They point to itsinvolvement in costly frontier exploration such as the C$5.2billion Hibernia offshore oil project, at a time when evenChairman Wilbert Hopper acknowledges the company isdebt-laden and hungry for capital.   Petro-Canada's preliminary offering document says it couldspend as much as C$860 million this year on exploration,development and other capital programs, including C$100million for Hibernia. In 1992 and 1993, its annualcommitments for the project will increase to C$200 million ayear. &quot;There's going to be a lot more stock issued and a lotmore debt needed to cover those expenses,&quot; Mr. Panet-Raymondpredicts.   To lure investors, Petro-Canada has cut employmentsteadily, halving the number of senior managers. It hasrestrutured both &quot;upstream&quot; production assets and&quot;downstream&quot; refining and marketing. It has moved into newventures such as producing an octane enhancer, MTBE, andmarketing propane, which it expects will boost earnings andcash flow.   On the downside, output of conventional crude declined to52,000 barrels a day in 1990 from 61,100 in 1986. Output oflowerpriced, heavy crude climbed in the period. Abouttwo-thirds of Petro-Canada's conventional oil reserves arereaped through &quot;enhanced&quot; oil recovery, which boostsproduction costs. Its yields from its refining and marketingstill don't match its two big rivals. &quot;For us, Imperial andShell are far more attractive,&quot; says Mr. Jarislowsky. &quot;Theyare strong marketers and they are reasonably cheap.&quot; Bothtrade at multiples of about seven times cash flow. If pricedat C$15, Petro-Canada would be at less than five times cashflow.   Imperial, 70% owned by Exxon, is rapidly seeing benefitsfrom last year's acquisition of Texaco Canada. Shell Canada,78% controlled by Royal Dutch/Shell Group, has a 70% stake inthe big Caroline gas discovery. &quot;Caroline alone means Shelloffers superior prospects,&quot; said Jim Doak, vice president ofFirst Marathon Securities here.   Petro-Canada's spending plans suggest that the dividend itaims to begin paying in the third quarter will be much lessthan the industry average yield of 4.5%. The most frequentlyquoted figure is a modest 1% to 1.5%. &quot;In the long run, this{new stock} issue could be a boon to Shell and Imperial asinvestors realize what good value they already have in theirholdings of those companies,&quot; said Ian Doig, publisher of anoil industry newsletter.   ---                How Petro-Canada Has Done                                                                                                          Comparison of financial results for three month endedMarch 1991 and 1990.
