It was more than just a whodunit for Shannon. She found thepolitical immorality spread by the drug barons was pervasive inMexico and there was a massive cover-up.   She also found that the Reagan White House and State Departmentwere equally reluctant to see the murder investigation pursuedbecause it was disruptive of American foreign policy. Somecourageous officials, however, resisted pressure and pushed theinvestigation.   Camarena, an agent of the Drug Enforcement Administration, wasabducted on Feb. 7, 1985, in Guadalajara, Mexico. He was torturedand murdered by the drug lords he was trying to bring to justice.   Shannon tells the whole dirty story in her book ``Desperados,''which has been made into a six-hour NBC miniseries called ``DrugWars: The Camarena Story.''   The three-part series, to be shown this fall, stars Steven Baueras Camarena, Elizabeth Pena as his wife, Mika, and Craig T. Nelsonand Treat Williams as drug agents. Michael Mann (``Miami Vice'')was executive producer.   ``I traveled in Mexico and the Southwest, particularlyCalifornia, and talked to everybody I could find who knew about themurder,'' said Shannon on a visit to Los Angeles. Shannon, who isexpecting her first child next month, is married to Dan Morgan ofthe Washington Post. She spent 10 years covering the Department ofJustice for Newsweek, which she left after beginning the book. Shecurrently works for Time in Washington.   ``This is really about American policy. We have agents all overthe world. Are they being supported by our embassies and ourgovernment? I talked to Mexican officials last. I didn't want themfollowing me around and seeing who I was talking to.   ``There is a lot of information out there. I didn't have to usethe Freedom of Information Act at all. I talked to a lot of Customsagents who had seen the explosion of drugs coming in through theSouth. Cocaine and marijuana comes almost exclusively from LatinAmerica.''   With the help of investigators here and abroad, Shannon was ableto put together a picture of the corruption and cover-up.   ``In Mexico corruption is a way of life,'' she said. ``It'sessential to the drug traffic. Whenever corruption is exposed theperson is usually allowed to quietly resign.''   Shannon said Camarena, a very moral and dedicated man,volunteered for duty in Guadalajara because it's the only placeoutside of Colombia to find the drug lords. She said he was killedwhen he got too close to the drug bosses, as well as theirhigh-ranking allies in the Mexican government and police.   She describes an incident in the book in which American agentswatched helplessly as a top official of the Mexican FederalJudicial Police allowed an escape by a suspected drug kingpinbehind the murder. Informants told the agents he promised $270,000to the official.   Shannon also tells of opposition from the U.S. State Departmentand the White House to the murder investigation.   ``Not because of corruption but because the agents botherimportant people,'' she said. ``The American banking community alsoraised hell when the Customs Service ordered strict inspection ofvehicles at the border. It effectively shut down the border and thebankers complained that it disrupted trade.''   Shannon said she was pleased that Michael Mann produced theseries because drug dealers had been portrayed as villains on``Miami Vice.''   ``In so many movies you see the stars taking dope andgiggling,'' she said. ``Mann made these people the bad guys. I wasconcerned that the book not be cheap entertainment or lose itsdignity. He was zealous about the realism, and respectful of thecharacters.''   Shannon points out in her book that a number of agents andothers put their careers on the line to press ahead with theinvestigation and speak out against the corruption.   ``One of the messages I hope comes through in this is that whilelaw enforcement people can take direct action, all of us facechoices,'' she said. ``We can do things to help. We can refuse tobe a part of a lie. Many people I interviewed did that and Igreatly admire them.''</TEXT><TEXT>   Elsewhere in television:   HEART AND SOUL _ ABC's ``Home,'' looking at lifestyles and heartattacks this week, has a live report by satellite on Thursday.
