Without that stint across the border, the 57-year-old executive probably wouldn't now head a company that derived 98% of its 15.8 billion Swiss francs ($11 billion) in sales last year from abroad.    &quot;Italy taught me the trade,&quot; says Mr. Krauer, adding that the experience instilled &quot;confidence in dealing with people in the front lines&quot; -- subsidiaries in 60 countries on five continents.    A global outlook is crucial in small Switzerland, but few companies can match the export prowess of the Swiss chemical giants. &quot;In the long term, they have perfected the approach,&quot; says Ian Broadhurst, Swiss stocks analyst at Warburg Securities in London.    From its small base in Basel, Ciba-Geigy has grown into the world's No. 1 producer of dyestuffs, plastic-industry additives and organic pigments; No. 2 in agrochemicals and No. 3 in pharmaceuticals, after recently ceding the second spot to American Home Products Corp., New York.    A streetcar ride away are the headquarters of Switzerland's other two chemical leaders, Sandoz AG and F. Hoffmann-La Roche andamp; Co. Of Sandoz's 8.98 billion Swiss francs in 1987 sales, some 95% were foreign. Hoffmann-La Roche had 96% of its 7.7 billion francs in sales abroad.    Their aspiring staff members also are put to the foreign test. &quot;All our executives go through foreign job rotation,&quot; says a Sandoz spokeswoman. For Roche's chief operating officer, Andres Leuenberger, it was 10 years in Japan cultivating what is now a growth area for the company.    Indeed, analysts suggest that the Swiss big three have long followed the same general strategy, compensating for a tiny home market of 6.5 million people through foreign know-how, high-quality specialty products, heavy research investment and impressive cash resources built up through conservative accounting.    &quot;The small domestic market and the increase in the franc since 1973 have been true drawbacks,&quot; says Gilbert Puder, an analyst at Bank Sarasin andamp; Cie. in Basel. &quot;But they have learned how to live with it.&quot;    In 1973 the dollar stood at 3.763 francs; by 1980 it had fallen to 1.593. The U.S. currency picked up earlier this decade, reaching 2.65 francs in 1985. But then its decline resumed, to about 1.430 currently.    The Swiss chemical companies haven't escaped profit slowdowns or declines in recent years. Ciba-Geigy's net profit fell 21% in 1986 and 5.3% last year, to 1.1 billion francs. The company blamed translation from local currencies into Swiss francs for diminishing net by a total of more than one billion francs in the two years.    Yet Swiss chemical exports have continued to rise, reaching 14.5 billion francs last year. And the chemical sector has been consistently profitable, more than can be said for the Swiss machinery, textile and watch industries.    Albert Bodmer, president of the Swiss Society for Chemical Industries, says much of the &quot;limited sensitivity to the dollar&quot; stems from the chemical companies' production and research facilities outside Switzerland.    Combined 1987 sales of Ciba-Geigy, Sandoz and Hoffmann-La Roche at 32.5 billion francs were more than double total Swiss chemical exports, indicating the extent of the big three's foreign production. In 1986, the latest year available, they spent 2.09 billion francs on foreign research, almost as much as the 2.19 billion francs they allotted at home.    Some 85% of all Swiss chemical companies' sales come from exports, compared with 51% in West Germany and 47% in the U.K. &quot;I think you can say that in no other country are companies in the chemical sector so intertwined internationally,&quot; says Bernhard Buehler, a spokesman at the chemical industry society.    Swiss industry in general depends on exports, which supply around 47% of inflation-adjusted gross domestic product. But the stronger Swiss franc has had a greater impact on sectors that have kept the bulk of their production at home.    Employment in the textile and watch industries, hurt by competition from countries with cheaper labor costs, has been roughly halved since 1970.    Weapons maker Oerlikon Buehrle Holding AG has twice omitted its dividend after heavy losses. Troubled by slowing world demand for power plants, Brown Boveri, the country's largest machine maker, recently merged with Asea of Sweden.    Meanwhile, Ciba-Geigy, Sandoz and Hoffmann-La Roche are reaping the benefits of a foreign presence that dates back to the 19th century. The chemical sector has led the economy in industrial-production gains and has steadily increased employment, to 74,000.    Analysts say streamlining measures initiated in the early 1980s are paying off. Research and development spending has been stepped up in a drive for new products. Says Bank J. Vontobel analyst Claudio Werder: The companies &quot;are now in a position to react extremely quickly to market signals&quot; and &quot;be major players&quot; in a global trend toward consolidation of the pharmaceuticals industry.    But Mr. Krauer predicts no major acquisitions by Ciba-Geigy, as it concentrates on internal growth and smaller purchases that round off product lines.    Nor does he see an easy road ahead. &quot;To remain internationally competitive, we must constantly make up and compensate for the disadvantages of a high-cost country and the Swiss franc's position as one of the strongest currencies in the world,&quot; he told the annual general meeting in April. </TEXT></DOC>
