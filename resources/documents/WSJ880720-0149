The International Fabricare Institute has a laboratory that analyzes more than 46,000 a year.    Garments are submitted to us because of customer complaints after professional laundering or dry cleaning. The purpose of the laboratory is to determine who is responsible for the adverse conditions. Of the more than 46,000 garments handled last year, 47% were the responsibility of garment failure due to the manufacturer, 37.5% because of consumer error, and 15.5% due to dry-cleaner error.    The No. 1 complaint against manufacturers was the presence of dyes that weren't colorfast to dry cleaning when the garment was labeled dry cleanable. Another category was the presence of watersoluble dyes on garments that were labeled washable. A huge category of problems exists when decorative trim -- such as beads, sequins, leather or suede -- isn't colorfast to the care procedure.    Of the articles that we processed in the lab, approximately 70% of these manufacturer failures were imported fabrics. Knowing where the garment is made before purchasing can sometimes be an assurance to the consumer and the dry cleaner that the percentage of probable failure will be less with domestically made garments.    Norman Oehlke   Director, Member Services   International Fabricare Institute   Silver Spring, Md.   ---   We at Monsanto have been concerned about quality in apparel products for 26 years. That's why in 1962, we instituted our Wear-Dated program in men's dress shirts. Over the years, we have extended this program to include other apparel, upholstery fabrics and carpeting.    We test items for attributes the consumer can't see. In apparel, we look for seam strength and no bagging, sagging, snagging or pilling. Essentially, we want a garment that will continue to look good wash after wash. If a garment fails to give normal wear, we will replace it or refund the purchase price.    Monsanto has spent millions of dollars testing garments and selecting those good enough to carry the Wear-Dated label. We must be doing something right, because Monsanto is now the largest domestic producer of acrylic fibers in the U.S.    Earl N. Brasfield   Group Vice President   Fibers Division   Monsanto Co.
