A police officer, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said theblaze wiped out most of the shanties in the camp at Mirpour, northof the city. The fire was believed caused by an electricalshort-circuit.   The camp housed Biharis awaiting resettlement in Pakistan. TheBiharis, who are Moslems, originated in India but settled in theterritory once known as East Pakistan. The territory becameBangladesh in 1971, after a war with Pakistan.   Thousands of Biharis have been resettled in Pakistan, but nearly250,000 remain in Bangladesh awaiting transfer. The resettlementprogram has been suspended for lack of funds.   Nasim Khan, a leader of the Biharis, complained that there areoften fires at the refugee camps because of poor construction.   ``Our repeated requests to the concerned authorities to dosomething about it have produced no results,'' Khan said. Heestimated it would cost $3 million to rebuild the camp and replacethe families' lost goods.   There was no word on the conditions of those injured.</TEXT></DOC>
