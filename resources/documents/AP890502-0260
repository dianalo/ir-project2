The exchange said Monday that it has hired economist Sanford J.Grossman of Princeton University to study the practice inconjunction with the Board of Trade's own review of tradingpractices.   The announcement comes three months after disclosure of afederal investigation into suspected fraud that is said to involvedual trading at the Board of Trade and the Chicago MercantileExchange.   Dual trading allows traders to buy or sell futures contracts forthemselves and customers at the same time. Dual trading isn'tillegal but critics call it a conflict of interest and say itencourages fraud by unscrupulous traders who trade their ownaccounts first, profiting at the expense of their customers.   ``The Chicago Board of Trade has dedicated itself to evaluatingall aspects of trading practices and market surveillance,'' saidKarsten Mahlmann, chairman of the exchange. ``Commissioning thisstudy is another step in this process.''   Meanwhile, at a meeting Monday, Merc officials told more than200 exchange members that they have no choice but to reform tradingpractices or else invite government intervention.   ``In order to achieve the right to continued self-regulation, wemust act responsibly,'' said Leo Melamed, chairman of the Merc'sexecutive committee.   Merc officials leaving the meeting also said they expect areferendum will be held on the most controversial aspects of thereform package proposed April 19 by a special exchange committee,the Chicago Sun-Times reported today. Among proposals is a ban onmost forms of dual trading.   But Melamed said that ``much fine-tuning is required'' on theproposals.   Grossman, who will assess dual trading at the CBOT, was acontributor to a report on the 1987 stock market crash commissionedby the New York Stock Exchange.   The CBOT, at the request of the Commodities Futures TradingCommission, had previously conducted a study of dual trading. Thestudy said the practice of dual trading results in a better pricefor customers and adds to the liquidity of the market.   The study also contended that customers can choose to trade witha broker who does not trade for himself.</TEXT></DOC>
