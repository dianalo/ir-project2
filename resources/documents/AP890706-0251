Jeffrey Edelman, a retail analyst at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.,said industrywide sales were mixed with poorer tallies coming fromnon-clothing categories.   Among the leading general merchandisers, K mart Corp., thecountry's second largest retailer after Sears, Roebuck and Co., saidits June sales represented an improvement after a string ofdisappointing months.   Fast-growing discounter Wal-Mart Stores Inc., currently rankedthird, turned in another robust performance.   Higher inflation and costlier instalment debt payments, due topast interest rate increases, have pinched consumers. A spendingslowdown has shown up mainly in purchases of big-ticket items, likecars and home appliances, while outlays for less expensivemerchandise haven't been affected as much.   But Edelman said the moderation in consumer spending, the chieffuel for overall economic activity, has more to do with the aging ofthe business cycle.   ``The consumer is still healthy, still confident, but I think alot of demand has been satisfied,'' said Edelman. ``I think theconsumer is just tired and needs to rest a little bit.''   Industry analysts said general merchandise retailers' results inJune may have appeared a bit weaker than they actually were becausethey were being compared with one of 1988's better months. Bycontrast, results of apparel sellers may have looked better becauselast year was an exceptionally dismal one for fashion merchandising.   Analysts typically look to the results of Limited Inc. for signsof how the women's apparel business is doing.   Limited posted an 11 percent rise in sales to $387 million in thefive weeks ended July 1 from $347.5 a year earlier. Besides itsflagship women's clothing shops, Limited owns a number of otherstores such as Henri Bendel, Victoria's Secret and Abercrombie andamp;Fitch.   Sales at Limited's stores open at least a year rose 12 percent inJune. Retailers and industry analysts say same-store, or comparablestore, sales give a more accurate reading of a company's performancethan totals that include sales at newly opened stores. Not everyretailer reports same-store sales.   Last month's standouts included Dayton Hudson Corp., which saidJune sales rose 14.2 percent to $1.20 billion from $1.05 billion inJune of 1988, and its same-store sales rose 6.1 percent. Thedepartment store operator, which also runs Target's and Mervyn'sstores, reported strong gains in its apparel sales.   J.C. Penney Co. also attributed its sales pickup to demand forsummer fashions plus increased purchases of soft home furnishingslike bedding and bath goods. Its June sales rose 7.6 percent to$1.25 billion from $1.16 billion, and same-store sales increased 5.6percent.   Among the leading retailers reporting today were:   Sears said its sales rose 2.9 percent to $3.2 billion in the fiveweeks ended July 1 from $3.11 billion a year earlier. On acomparable-store basis, Sears' sales increased 3.6 percent.   K mart's sales rose 5.7 percent to $2.74 billion in the fiveweeks ended June 28 from $2.60 billion in the corresponding 1988period. Same-store sales went up 2.3 percent.   Wal-Mart's sales grew 25 percent to $2.03 billion in June from$1.63 billion a year before, and its same-store sales rose 10percent.   F.W. Woolworth Co. said its domestic sales increased 8.2 percentin June to $439 million from the year ago's $405 million, and itssame-store sales were up 3.6 percent.   The results reported today were from the biggest generalmerchandise chains and apparel retailers. Unlike monthly retailsales figures released by the federal government, they do notinclude sales at auto dealers, supermarkets or restaurants.</TEXT></DOC>
