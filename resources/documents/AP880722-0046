Maj. Gen. Avihu Bin-Nun said Israel's air force was investingheavily in pilot training, new tactics and technology to meet thechallenge of an unprecedented Arab arms buildup.   ``We are trying to keep the qualitative edge, but when you lookat the numbers, it gets more and more difficult all the time,''Bin-Nun told reporters Thursday at the Hatzerim Air Force base inthe southern Negev Desert.   But he added: ``We believe we can cope even with the newtechnology the Arab countries are getting from all over the world.''   Bin-Nun said most of the billions of dollars Arab countries havespent on weapons in recent years have gone toward beefing up theirair power. He said Israel was especially concerned about the armsbuildup in Iraq, Syria and Saudia Arabia.   ``The number of fighters that can attack Israel in 20 minutes offlight is more than 1,500,'' he said.   The London-based International Institute for Strategic Studiessays in its 1987-88 report that the Arab countries most likely toengage in a war with Israel have a combined force of 2,358 combataircraft, compared to 676 in Israel and 2,409 in the North AtlanticTreaty Organization's European deployment areas.   Israel was very concerned about the recent $30 billion Britisharms sale to Saudi Arabia, a country that has participated directlyor indirectly in all wars against Israel, Bin-Nun said.   The package includes sophisticated Tornado fighter planes whoserange enables them to hit any Israeli target from Saudi Arabia, hesaid.   ``We must take into account that in case of war (against Israel)the equipment either will be used by the Saudis or sent over to oneof the countries at war with us,'' Bin-Nun said.   He said the agreement with Britain did not bar the Saudis fromsending weapons to other countries.   In addition, Saudi Arabia has transferred billions of dollarsworth of arms purchased from the United States to Iraq, apparentlywithout U.S. approval, he said.   With the prospect of a cease-fire in the Iran-Iraq war, theIraqi air force also has become a greater threat, he said.   He said Iraq has sophisticated fighter planes supplied by theFrench and Soviets and has gained a great deal of experience duringthe 8-year-old Persian Gulf war.   But Bin-Nun said the Iraqis ``haven't achieved what an air forceof this size could have achieved after so many years ofexperience,'' and that Israel could cope with the threat.   The Iranian air force poses no threat because it is small andpoorly maintained, said Bin-Nun.   Another potential threat comes from Syria, one of Israel's mostimplacable enemies, he said.   Since Israel's 1982 invasion of Lebanon, Syria has tripled thenumber of ground-to-air missiles, and today batteries of SAM-5missiles are aimed at all of Israel's air space, he said.   ``If you fly over the southern part of Israel above 20,000 feet,you are under the cover of the SAM-5s,'' he said. ``You can shootdown airplanes over here from Syria.''   In addition, Syria reportedly is buying M-9 surface-to-surfacemissiles from China and, according to Israeli officials, isdeveloping chemical warheads.   ``We are taking the threat from Syria very seriously,'' Bin-Nunsaid, but ``if we have to fight the Syrians, we will suprise themagain.''   He also vowed that Israel would retaliate harshly against anymissile attack. During the 1973 Middle East war, for example, Syriaaimed a missile at a northern Israeli air force base, but struck anIsraeli village instead, he said.   ``The next morning, 80 bombs hit general headquarters in themiddle of Damascus,'' he said. ``The air force is capable ofhitting any target within any distance. We proved it once, and wehope we don't need to prove it again.''   In another development, Bin-Nun said Israel hoped to sign a newcontract with the United States soon for the purchase of additionalF-15 fighter planes. He would not elaborate.</TEXT></DOC>
