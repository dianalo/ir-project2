Rowan says hestill strongly opposes handguns, even though he used one to shoot ateen-ager who had taken an uninvited dip in his backyard swimmingpool.   ``I am absolutely for gun control. I still am,'' said Rowan.``But as long as we have a situation where druggies can get gunseasily, you have to protect yourself.''   Rowan shot the 18-year-old youth in the wrist early Tuesdaymorning at his home in an affluent section of the city. He said hefired only after the young man lunged at him.   The youth, Ben Smith of Chevy Chase, Md., disputed Rowan'saccount, saying he was trying to flee when Rowan shot him. ``That'sno reason to shoot a person _ for swimming in his pool,'' Smithsaid.   Smith and a companion were initially charged with unlawfulentry, but those charges were dropped later on Tuesday.   Police said the .22 caliber pistol Rowan used was not registeredwith the city, which has some of the toughest gun-control laws inthe nation. Rowan said, however, that it was registered with thefederal government.   The District of Columbia passed a law in 1976 saying that onlyguns already then registered were legal for private possession.Police said their investigation was continuing.   Rowan said he was awakened at about 1:55 a.m. by the sound ofsomeone outside his bedroom window.   ``I lay there thinking, `Did I dream that?' Then I heard a womanscream or shout,'' he said.   He said he peeked out, saw four people at his pool and calledthe police.   ``After I called the police, I got the gun,'' said Rowan.   He said the weapon was given to him by his son, Carl T. RowanJr., an attorney and former FBI agent, after he had receivedseveral threats.   ``When I saw the police cars arriving, I opened the pool doorassuming the police would want to come in that way.   ``I was confronted by a tall, young man striding over as ifcoming into my house.   ``First I said, `Freeze.' Then I said, `I warn you, I have agun.'''   ``He said, `Aw hell, man', and kept coming.''   ``That kid was at point blank range as he tried to come into myhouse. I was trying to let him know he was walking into peril. Iwas shooting at his feet, but he was lunging at me.''   Smith, who was treated at Georgetown University Hospital andreleased in good condition, told local radio station WMAL that hewas on Rowan's property, but didn't threaten him.   ``He had no right to shoot me. I mean I guess I was trespassing.That's no reason to shoot a person _ for swimming in his pool,''Smith said.   Smith said he was trying to flee when he was confronted by Rowan.   Smith and a companion, Laura Bachman, 19, of Bethesda, Md., werecharged by police with unlawful entry, but those charges were laterdropped by the U.S. attorney, which prosecutes all crimes in theDistrict of Columbia. Rowan said the others he saw at the pool gotaway.   A spokesman for the U.S. attorney's office, who asked not to beidentified, said the investigation of the case continued, as didD.C. police spokesman Capt. William White.   Rowan said the gun, which police confiscated, was purchased byhis son when he was with the FBI and is registered with the federalgovernment.   ``When he left the FBI he went to the district authorities tosee if it had to be registered with the district,'' said Rowan.``They said it didn't need to be.   ``He left the gun in my house to protect the family during aperiod a few years ago when we were receiving threats,'' Rowansaid. ``Last night was the first time I ever fired that weapon.''   Rowan was criticized as hypocritical by Wayne LaPierre,legislative coordinator for the National Rifle Association.   ``He's another example of someone who is out front for takingfirearms away from other people, but when they make the decisionfor themselves, they choose to own one,'' said LaPierre.</TEXT></DOC>
