In Kentucky's 1st District, incumbent Rep. Carroll Hubbardtraded charges of incompetence and unethical conduct withchallenger Lacey T. Smith in perhaps the most heated primary on theballot Tuesday.   ``The people have not only said yes to Carroll Hubbard, but theyhave said no, a loud no, to the type of campaigning that we've seenin this race,'' the 50-year-old congressman said after receiving 73percent of the vote in the most bitterly contested race.   With all but four of the district's 491 precincts reportingunofficial returns, Hubbard received 62,251 votes to 22,828 votes,or 27 percent, for Smith, a 48-year-old businessman who moved fromFlorida to seek Hubbard's seat.   Hubbard called Smith a carpetbagger and questioned hisdedication to his recently acquired Baptist faith. Smith accusedHubbard of incompetence and improperly investigating a loan Smithhad received.   Roll Call, a Washington weekly that calls itself ``the newspaperof the Congress,'' had labeled the campaign ``the nastiest in thecountry.''   The two other incumbent Democratic congressmen facing primaryopposition, William H. Natcher in the 2nd District and RomanoMazzoli in the 3rd District, also won easy renomination.   In the state's 3rd District, which covers Louisville, nine-termincumbent Mazzoli defeated Jeffrey Hutter, a Humana Inc. healthservices executive and former television news reporter, after acampaign in which Hutter claimed that Mazzoli had done little forthe district despite his seniority.   Mazzoli received 31,288 votes, or 61 percent, to 20,207 votes,or 39 percent, for Hutter with all 350 precincts reportingunofficial results. Former U.S. Attorney Philip Dunnagan easily wonthe Republican nomination against two perennial candidates.   Rep. William H. Natcher, who has represented the 2nd Districtsince 1953, defeated Bob Evans, a farmer whom Natcher beat by 79percent to 21 percent in the primary two years ago.   With all 414 precincts reporting unofficial returns, Natcher had26,918 votes, or 76 percent, to 8,319 votes, or 24 percent, forEvans.   Republicans selected former assistant U.S. Attorney PhilipDunnagan to carry their banner in the 3rd District in the fall.Martin A. Tori of Radcliff was unopposed for the Republicannomination in the 2nd District.   In Idaho, state Rep. Jeanne Givens of Coeur d'Alene, afull-blooded Coeur d'Alene Indian, manufactured a huge victory overBonners Ferry attorney Bruce Robinson and Lewiston apartmentmanager David Shepherd for the Democratic nomination to facefour-term Republican Congressman Larry Craig in the 1st District.   With 73 percent of the 418 precincts reporting, Mrs. Givens had63 percent to Shepherd's 21 percent and Robinson's 16 percent.   Voters in the conservative 2nd District of southern Idaho gaveformer state Sen. Dane Watkins of Idaho Falls the Republicannomination to challenge two-term Democratic Congressman RichardStallings in the fall.   With 68 percent of the precincts reporting, Watkins had 58percent and political novice Janet Reid of Idaho Falls had 42percent.   In Kentucky, attention centered on the Democratic contests,whose winners were expected to be heavy favorites in November inthe heavily Democratic districts.   Hubbard faces independent candidate Charles K. Hatchett inNovember. The incumbent had not faced serious opposition inKentucky's 1st Congressional District, which covers the state'swesternmost counties, since ousting incumbent Frank Stubblefield inthe 1974 primary.   Smith, his opponent, admitted that the carpetbagger image hurthim badly.   ``I think that he created enough of a question about mycommitment to western Kentucky. I think people just weren't able totake a chance on it,'' Smith said.</TEXT></DOC>
