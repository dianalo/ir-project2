As Richard W. Murphy, formerly one of the State Department's topMiddle East experts so aptly put it over the weekend, ``the bazaaris open,'' and the offers, counteroffers, threats and ultimatumsare starting to be heard from all sides. ...   It could be encouraging if it means that Iran and Syria arefinally ready to use their influence _ which means apply pressure _on Hezbollah, the radical Shiite group that holds the Westernhostages.   At the same time, the direct involvment of outside forces, eachwith its own priorities, promises to complicate any confidentialnegotiations aimed at pulling off a prisoner swap. ...   Complicating things still further are the family ties thataccount for at least some of the hostage-taking in Lebanon. Many ofthe 17 Shiites jailed in Kuwait for attacks on the U.S. and Frenchembassies, for example, are related to a single Lebanesehostage-taking clan, whose one demand from the beginning has beenfor their release. ...   If indeed, behind-the-scenes efforts are under way to constructa grand exchange, a lot of countries and a lot of parties will haveto be involved. It's going to be a hard and probably lengthybusiness, and given the disparate interests involved, the outcomecan by no means be taken for granted.</TEXT><TEXT>   Aug. 7   The Daily Republic, Mitchell, S.D., on the mandatory retirementof pilots:   United Flight 232 Captain Al Haynes did a great job of bringinghome an uncontrollable plane. Although he claims he's no hero, hisyears of experience resulted in the salvation of 185 lives.   However, in two years, Haynes will be forced to end his career,following 35 years of service. A 29-year-old nonsensical FederalAviation Administration rule requires 60-year-old pilots to handover their licenses. ...   Behind this mandate is a concern that pilots over 60 may be ahealth risk, with increased chances for a heart attack or stroke.   We, however, agree with Donald Engen, former administrator ofthe FAA, when he said, ``When push comes to shove, when everythingturns to worms, experience is what really counts.''</TEXT><TEXT>   Aug. 8   Topeka (Kan.) Capital-Journal on disaster aid:   Thanks To Sen. Bob Dole, farmers hurting from the drought _ orin some areas, floods _ finally will get relief.   Dole's compromise on the disaster-aid bill ... made the measureacceptable to both Democrats and President Bush. That is no smallfeat.   To satisfy administration concerns, Dole keyed payments toparticipation in crop insurance programs. The plan is more generousin payments to farmers who buy protection.   Perhaps Dole will spark a new trend toward compromise with hisexample on the disaster-aid bill. It would be a refreshing change.</TEXT><TEXT>   Aug. 4   Grants Pass (Ore.) Daily Courier on the federal drug war:   If there were any drug lords quaking over federal officials'declared war on drugs, the news of the past week should have calmedtheir fears. ...   The Senate voted ... to throw the drug soldiers a $1.7 billionbone, snipping that meager amount off the huge $295 billionsdefense budget. ...   Meanwhile, ... drug czar William J. Bennett's ... draft of anational strategy to fight drugs, the final version of which is dueSept. 5, is vague and gives little attention to dangerous drugssuch as methamphetamine, according to administration officials whohave seen it. ...   It calls for an all-out war on marijuana. Marijuana ... hardlypacks the punch or attracts the gun-toting people meth and heroindo. ...   Bennett's tentative plans, according to officials, ... call fortaking away educational and highway funds if states don't teach theanti-drug classes or yank the licenses of drivers convicted of drugoffenses.   Let's hope Bennett's strategy turns into a comprehensive planthat provides help, not just threats, for the states.</TEXT><TEXT>   Aug. 2   Daily Star-Journal, Warrensburg, Mo. on federal report on druguse:   If the numbers regarding those who have quit taking drugs overthe survey period could build into a trend, there is light to beseen at the end of the dark tunnel of drugs.   There cannot be a letup in the all-out fight against illegaldrugs. The stake are far too high to slacken the effort for onemoment.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
