The Arabs and Israelis seem like youngsters forever on asee-saw, incapable of finding the point of equilibrium thatcould permit them to dismount from their precarious perches.When one side is up, it merely revels in the advantage, andassumes it will last; when one side is down it merely pushesthat much harder to regain the heights. In the Mideast thereis no concept of balance of power; the only shared value issearch for advantage.</LP><TEXT>   The most remarkable statement by Iraqi President SaddamHussein, in the course of a recent 3 1/2-hour interviewreplete with bellicose talk of the increasing inevitabilityof war with Israel, was his admission that the Arabs made amistake passing up Israel's 1967 offer of land in exchangefor peace. Under that proposal Israel would have returned tothe Arabs most of the West Bank and Gaza, captured in theJune 1967 war, in exchange for Arab recognition of Israel.   &quot;The Arabs have made their mistakes,&quot; he said. So, here wehave the Arab world's most radical ruler musing about missedopportunities for peace -- but nearly a quarter-century toolate.   Meanwhile, in an Israel increasingly dominated bypolitical hardliners, that West Bank, once seen as abargaining chip for peace, is now considered an integral partof the divinely demarcated Land of Israel. &quot;The eternal rightof the Jewish people to Eretz Yisrael is not subject toquestion,&quot; say the new government's policy guidelines. Justas the Arabs say they are ready to offer peace for land,Israel is no longer willing to accept it. The prospect forpeace talks is dimmer now than at any time. Threats of warare louder.   There is every reason to believe Israel is repeating themistake the Arabs made -- missing a genuine opportunity. Itis however by no means certain that, if the West Bank wereback on the bargaining table, Saddam Hussein and his Arabbrethren indeed would trade land for peace.   The last clear opportunity was 1983. Then, Egypt wassidelined by the Camp David peace accord, Iraq was enmeshedin war with Iran, Syria was ensnared in Lebanese strife, theWest was well past its oil fright and, most important, Israelhad Ronald Reagan, a committed ally, in the White House. Theproblem: Arabs felt too weak while Israel believed itself toostrong.   Since then, the see-saw has begun to tip again. The startof the 1990s finds Iraq freed of its war with Iran but leftwith a million-man army. Israeli-Egyptian relations havesoured. Radicalized Palestinians are creating continuingturmoil in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza. Adispassionate President Bush and disgruntled James Baker havereplaced the pro-Israeli team of Ronald Reagan and GeorgeShultz. With the Soviet threat diminishing and U.S. budgetpressures growing, the rationale for spending $3 billion ayear in aid to Israel as a &quot;forward base&quot; in the globalanti-communist struggle seems less sustainable. Before thedecade is out, the West is likely to find itself needing moreArab oil -- and thus listening more to Arab views.   Finally, U.S. opinion polls are showing a tilt away fromunquestioning U.S. support for Israel. A recent New YorkTimes/CBS poll found support for a Palestinian homelandrising to 47%, compared with 40% two years ago. And, while61% of Americans favored high levels of aid to Israel, thefigure was 72% a year ago.   The logical opportunity to strike a deal for peace? Not inthe endlessly illogical Middle East. The Israelis, who lessthan a decade earlier felt themselves too strong to needpeace, now appear unaware of the degree to which the see-sawis swinging to their long-term disadvantage. The Arabs, asreflected by Saddam Hussein's staunch militancy, are probablyexaggerating how much it has swung in their favor.   In the decade since Egypt signed a peace treaty withIsrael, Arabs have come slowly to realize there is nomilitary option to regain the occupied territories; only apolitical one. Yasir Arafat, chairman of the PalestineLiberation Organization, has minimally done what Israel andthe world demanded -- accepted Israel's right to exist.Nearly two years ago, in a speech in Geneva that paved theway for the first-ever PLO-U.S. dialogue, Mr. Arafat saidthat the PLO accepts the &quot;right of all parties concerned inthe Middle East conflict to exist in peace and security . . .including the state of Palestine, Israel and otherneighbors.&quot;   While Saddam Hussein blusters about retaliating against anIsraeli attack with chemical weapons, it's hard to concludethat he seeks to initiate war. He and his key advisers appearto recognize that Iran, not Israel, will continue to beIraq's major strategic threat. Beyond that, Iraq remains abitter enemy of Syria's Hafez al-Assad. Syria and Iran areenough to preoccupy Iraq without war with Israel.   The saber-rattling reverberating from Baghdad appearslargely intended to maintain Arab political and financialsupport for Iraq. Most important, Iraq aims to keep the PLOunder its control rather than tolerate Syrian or Egyptianinfluence, on the theory that the Arab nation controlling thePLO and Palestinians wins Arab hearts and wallets.   So, the most immediate threat to Israel's security is theinternal Palestinian uprising. The use of force hasn't calmedPalestinians, who continue to insist on human rights and ahomeland. But neither the uprising, nor the longer trendsworking against Israel, has so shifted the balance thatIsrael ought to fear negotiating now. Israel remains far andaway the region's most powerful military power and continuesto enjoy strong U.S. support. The equilibrium is sufficientto allow both Israelis and Palestinians to talk, to take achance that they can climb off the seesaw.   ---   Ms. House is vice president, international, of Dow Jones andamp;Co., publisher of The Wall Street Journal.</TEXT></DOC>
