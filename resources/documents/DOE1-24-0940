Movement of theshaft over the past few years has been confirmed through survey levelsof the shaft collar and two plumbline surveys of the top 100 feet ofthe shaft. This 3-D finite element calculation was done to gain an understandingof the deformation of the Service Shaft due to the subsidence of thesurrounding material. Subsidence at the site results from creep closureof the bi-level room-and-pillar salt mine which is currently the reservoirfor 73 million-barrels of crude oil. The 3-D finite element model treatsthe southwest corner of the mine and contains 118 pillars on two levelsof the mine. The deformation of the Service Shaft is determined fromthe displacement of a vertical line of nodes in the model which is assumedto be the axis of the Service Shaft. The calculation shows that the ServiceShaft is tilting to the northeast and moving downward. The movement,however, is mostly a rigid body rotation and translation with very slightbending and stretching of the shaft. Because the bending and tensilestrains are insignificant, this calculation indicates that rupture ofthe shaft is unlikely. 23 refs., 17 figs., 2 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
