Today, trees line the streets where morning joggers in designer track suits run past rows of neat houses and elegant clubs. Tribal villages have given way to a bustling, prosperous city of 550,000 people, many of whom enjoy free housing and medical care.    Jamshedpur, an oasis of peace and prosperity in one of India's poorest and most violent regions, was hauled out of the mud by one company: Tata Iron andamp; Steel Co., the country's largest private concern and flagship of the Tata group.    But the citizens of Jamshedpur pay a price for the privilege of being pampered. This is one of the world's largest company towns and what Tata says goes. Tata owns all the land (25 square miles) and the utilities. It operates the transport service, patrols the streets and runs the hospitals. It writes the laws and arbitrates legal disputes. It even regulates where kites can be flown and how candy should be displayed in markets -- and fines offenders.    &quot;It's like '1984,'&quot; says Ronald D'Costa, an owner of the Boulevard Hotel and a third-generation resident, referring to George Orwell's novel. &quot;Big Brother watches over you all the time.&quot;    Jamshedpur is also one of the best-run cities in India. Municipal workers don't strike, the roads are repaired, garbage is cleared, and the water is clean. Erratic electric supply, a major problem in much of India, is unknown.    The city isn't India's only company town. Private and state-owned companies patronize the urban areas that mushroom around their factories. But none do it on Tata's scale. Its singular control over an entire city stands out in a nation that prides itself as a thriving democracy.    To be sure, some citizens resent Tata's control. A local social worker petitioned the Supreme Court in June to allow Jamshedpur to have an elected government. But democracy holds no special allure in a country where elected governments are usually inefficient and often corrupt. Many in Jamshedpur accept Tata's heavy-handedness as a small sacrifice for a markedly better life.    &quot;From time to time we're authoritarian, but certainly not cruel,&quot; says Tata Iron's 77-year-old chairman, Russi Mody. &quot;Here things work. Take Tata Iron away and in three years things will be like anywhere else in India.&quot;    In 1907, Tata set up a steel plant at Kalimati and Sakchi villages, which were near coal and iron mines and a railway route. The town that grew up round the plant was named Jamshedpur after Tata's founder, Jamsetji Nusserwanji Tata.    It was British India's first steel plant set up entirely with Indian capital. The audacious venture was viewed with disdain by the British, who disparaged native enterprises. Sir Frederick Upcott, a senior colonial bureaucrat, promised to &quot;eat every pound&quot; if the Tatas ever managed to produce steel to British specifications. During World War I, Tata supplied 1,500 miles of steel rails to British-administered Mesopotamia. A joke at Tata centers on the indigestion Sir Frederick would have suffered had he honored his word.    Tata Iron today produces 1.7 million metric tons of steel a year and is considered the most efficient maker in India's massive steel industry. It also is the biggest and most profitable part of the Tata group, which is involved in power generation and the automotive, hotel, computer, chemical, tea and publishing industries.    A third of Jamshedpur's population is directly supported by the steel mill; most others are economically dependent on it. The city is governed by 40 commissioners ostensibly chosen by the Bihar state government. In fact the company nominates the majority, the rest being politicians affiliated with Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi's ruling Congress Party. The company admits it controls the committee and is careful about who becomes vice chairman, the committee's executive head.    &quot;We haven't allowed politicians to get the vice chairman's post,&quot; says D.N. Choudhury, the current vice chairman, who is also a Tata executive.    Tata Iron last year spent about $28 million on Jamshedpur's upkeep -- a sum that includes subsidized electricity, schools, hospitals and free family-planning and vaccination programs. The company offers startup loans, through local banks, for small-scale businessmen. It also does development work, such as drilling wells in 300 villages around Jamshedpur. In August, the company donated $71,000 for victims of an earthquake in the region.    But Tata is also liberal with its ire. The company pressures local newspapers and makes life difficult for employees and bureaucrats whom it deems insufficiently loyal. Motif, a local English-language weekly, has a reputation for printing critical stories about Tata. In the mid-1980s, Tata and businesses dependent on it withdrew their advertising after Motif accused Tata of treating a local sports organization as its fiefdom.    Devi Chatterji, Motif's 77-year-old editor, says his son, an architect in Tata Iron's town-planning operation, was forced to resign. When editor Chatterji continued to criticize Tata, the company filed a still-pending $770,000 defamation suit.    Tata Chairman Mody admits withdrawing advertising. &quot;They printed the vilest things about us,&quot; he says. &quot;We stood it long enough.&quot; But he denies the editor's son was forced to resign.    Jamshedpur residents also tell how officials in company-controlled clubs and charities are eased out if they don't toe the Tata line. &quot;To survive, you have to be a sycophant,&quot; says a local journalist.    Mr. Mody agrees that sycophancy thrives in the town. But he says it &quot;springs from a fear psychosis. If there is one thing I want to achieve in Jamshedpur, it's don't fear Tata Iron.&quot;    Local labor leaders say there is good reason to fear the company. They cite a 1958 labor demonstration in which hundreds of protesting unionists were shot by the state police and allege that the police were prompted into such drastic action by Tata. Mr. Mody responds that the company wasn't to blame and says the incident resulted from inter-union rivalry. </TEXT></DOC>
