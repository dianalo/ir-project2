For yourreaders' benefit, however, I would like to correct somefacts.   The article says that &quot;in 1879 Chile launched a surpriseattack&quot; against Bolivia. The fact is that in 1873 Boliviasigned a secret agreement with a neighboring country thatplanned a war against Chile. In January 1879, Boliviaconfiscated Chilean properties in Antofagasta, forcing Chileto defend the interests of its citizens. On March 1 of thatyear, Bolivia declared war on Chile.</LP><TEXT>   The article also claims Chile &quot;robbed&quot; Bolivia of itsseaport (Antofagasta). The fact is that in 1904, 20 yearsafter the war had ended, Chile and Bolivia signed a peacetreaty establishing the boundaries of the two countries, andincluded the basic conditions of the right-of-way agreement.This treaty was unanimously approved by Bolivia's Congressand highly praised by Bolivia's press. Why would a treatyunanimously approved be called a robbery some years later?   Gaston Velasco, president of Bolivian Maritime Action,says Bolivia &quot;because of Chile {is} asphyxiated . . .underdeveloped . . . cut off from the world.&quot; The fact is,Chile grants Bolivia one of the most favorable right-of-wayagreements of any landlocked country in the world, wellbeyond what is called for by the Convention of the UnitedNations on Landlocked Countries.   Finally, Chile has not remained &quot;cold&quot; to Bolivia's needs.Chile's permanent policy is to facilitate Bolivia's access tothe sea. As an example, Chile and Bolivia have agreed toconstruct a connecting highway between La Paz, Bolivia, andArica, Chile. Although Chile's part from Arica to theboundary is close to completion, Bolivia's part is not.   I could comment further on Chilean-Bolivian relations andhistory, but my purpose here is to affirm the friendship andgood will of Chile and contribute to a fruitful andconstructive relationship between our two countries as wemove toward the 21st century.   Patricio Silva Echenique   Ambassador of Chile   Washington   ---   I was surprised to read in your story that &quot;Chile launcheda surprise attack&quot; and the Bolivian coast was lost. Althoughyou do not mention it, the conflict was known as the &quot;War ofthe Pacific,&quot; started when Peru and Bolivia ganged up onChile. The two aggressors soon found that Chile'sGerman-trained army and British-trained navy were more than amatch for the combined Peruvian-Bolivian forces. Boliviawithdrew from the conflict. The Chilean navy blockadedCallao, Lima's port, and the Chilean army proceeded up thecoast to Lima and occupied the city for about two years.   A peace treaty was finally drawn between Chile and Peru,and Chilean forces withdrew from Lima but still occupied aportion of Peru's southern coast. Bolivia was left out of thenegotiations, and the treaty provided that Peru eventuallywould recover all territory along the coast down to whateverbecame Chile's northern borders.   In modern times, Chile has provided free use of the formerBolivian port to Bolivia and has offered on several occasionsto return the port to Bolivia. Peru says this violates thatpeace treaty and strongly objects. It seems to me yourcharacterization of Chile's role in this conflict is at oddswith the facts and gives Chile no credit for its efforts toreach accommodation with Bolivia over the years since the warended.   Warren G. Leonard   Sarasota, Fla.   ---   In 1947 I was with John Orlasky, commercial affairsofficer in the U.S. Embassy at La Paz, 12,500 feet up in theAndes, when an urgent cable arrived from the DevelopmentOffice of the State of Alabama.   The cable inquired when the S.S. Alabama, which wascompartmented to display all the commercial offerings of thestate, could call at La Paz, as one stop on a voyage to allthe Latin American countries.   What a wonderful chance to reply in true StateDepartmentese. This cable went back over the ambassador'ssignature:   &quot;Terrain difficulties would seem to make such a tripinadvisable at this time.&quot;   Cooper Walker   Baltimore   ---   Your story about Bolivia having a navy despite being alandlocked country brought to mind the story that came out ofa 1950s meeting of South American military officers. AVenezuelan general, part of the top echelon of the MarcosPerez Jimenez dictatorship, sarcastically asked a Bolivianadmiral why Bolivia had admirals. To which the admiral issaid to have replied: &quot;Why does Venezuela have a minister ofjustice?&quot;   Dan Harrison   Briarcliff Manor, N.Y.</TEXT></DOC>
