The plan, which Treasury officials are discussing withbanking-industry representatives, is a milder version of aproposal that Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. ChairmanWilliam Seidman made last month to impose a one-timeassessment of $1 per $100 of deposits. Banks would like aneven more gradual buildup of the fund, and Treasury officialshave told bankers that they haven't ruled out a $25 billionpayment stretched over five years. However, the advantage ofthe three-year plan is a more rapid recapitalization of theFDIC's Bank Insurance Fund. Any assessment would come on topof annual premiums that banks already pay into the FDIC'sfund.</LP><TEXT>   The annual premium is 19.5 cents for each $100 ofdeposits, but Mr. Seidman has hinted that his agency mayboost the premium to 23 cents. Under either a three-year orfive-year payment of a special assessment, bank payments tothe fund would increase sharply at a time when earnings arefalling and many banks have become cautious lenders in orderto conserve capital.   Faced with large numbers of bank failures, the insurancefund, which protects deposits up to a legal ceiling of$100,000, will drop to a projected $4 billion at the end of1991 from $13.2 billion at the end of 1989, unless there is acapital infusion. Rebuilding the fund has become the mosturgent element in an evolving Bush administration plan torevamp banking laws to strengthen both the deposit-insuranceprogram and the banking system.   Banking industry officials have vowed to maintain the fundat adequate levels, and have proposed &quot;trigger&quot; plans thatwould require banks to boost payments if the fund falls belowa certain level.   Government officials want more than a promise of futurepayments; they favor a rapid increase in insurance fundreserves in order to maintain public confidence in theprogram.   Both the Treasury and the industry are looking for ways toaccount for a special assessment that could soften the impacton banks. One possibility is to require banks to pay a 1%assessment over three years but allow them to write it offover five years.   Aside from worrying that sharply higher payments willdrive more banks into insolvency, industry officials fear thegovernment will find it difficult to reduce the assessmentsafter they have been phased in. The assessments count asgovernment revenues and therefore help to shrink the deficitat a time when Washington is looking for every dollar it canfind.   The Treasury proposal also will contain measures to limitthe drain on the deposit-insurance fund. Although the legalceiling for deposit insurance is $100,000, most largedepositors in failed banks are covered in full. The FDIC alsohas protected deposits in foreign branches of U.S. banks --deposits that aren't legally covered by federal insurance.Among other things, the Treasury is considering limiting thenumber of protected accounts each depositor can maintain inone bank or paying less than the full amount of depositsbeyond the $100,000 ceiling.   Such limits on the scope of the deposit-insurance safetynet would be phased in over the period of the Bank InsuranceFund recapitalization plan.   The Treasury also will propose to Congress changes inDepression-era laws, thus enabling banks to operatenationwide and allowing banks to combine with securitiesfirms and possibly industrial companies.</TEXT></DOC>
