Are Duncan Hines Muffin Mix toppings really just sugar in disguise? Are theater sets for a Mozart opera works of art?    The U.S. Customs Service has to resolve such questions. But the answer varies depending on when you ask, and which Customs officials respond, according to frustrated businessmen who have to wade through the customs classification codes for imports. They contend the inconsistent replies have created such uncertainty that their ability to compete in international trade is threatened.    &quot;The service has developed a bad-cop mentality toward industry,&quot; charges John Donaldson, of the Joint Industry Group, a coalition of businesses involved in international trade. &quot;Customs is supposed to stop fraud and illegal activity, not stop imports and exports.&quot;    A House Ways and Means subcommittee today will ask U.S. Customs Service Commissioner William von Raab to answer the charges that his agency is playing a costly game of &quot;trivial pursuit&quot; with industry. Customs officials declined to comment before his testimony.    Among the complaints is one from Michael Laden, manager of customs operations for Fingerhut Corp. in Minnetonka, Minn. He says that a routine shipment of sewing kits was detained by customs officials in Seattle who insisted they were luggage and not sewing kits. If classified as luggage, the kits would have been subject to almost three times the duties required on sewing kits, and worse, they would be subject to strict import quotas.    A desperate Mr. Laden hopped on a plane, armed with one of his sewing kits, to plead with customs officials in New York.    &quot;It was difficult to understand, but the guys at Seattle insisted you could carry lingerie and shaving gear where you were supposed to put your yarns,&quot; says Mr. Laden.    Thankfully, says Mr. Laden, officials in New York reversed the Seattle decision, but not before hundreds of orders had to be canceled.    In another case, Cincinnati-based Procter andamp; Gamble Co., makers of Duncan Hines Muffin Mix, got into trouble with the Customs Service when they unexpectedly ran out of muffin topping. Forced to import some topping from their plant in Pointe Claire, Canada, Pandamp;G called a Customs Service import specialist in New York to determine the right classification.    Some six weeks after the agency cleared the topping supply, it sent Pandamp;G a notice that it had to return the mix because officials had decided the topping mix was subject to the U.S. import quota on sugar.    The company was forced to suspend production for more than seven weeks, at a cost of more than $200,000, before the Customs Service again reversed itself and said the importation was correct. If the agency had stuck with the sugar classification, Pandamp;G would have had to pay a $750,000 penalty for topping that had a sugar content worth $30,000.    David Elliot of Pandamp;G's international department said the enforcement attitude of customs officials has led to an &quot;undue level of fear of enforcement harassment. We just can't conduct international trade well on this basis.&quot;    Such disputes between importers and the Customs Service aren't just a recent phenomenon. One unresolved battle began in the early 1980s, when Washington-based opera organizers, Opera America Inc., imported theater sets for three Mozart operas. Opera America was told the sets were &quot;utility items&quot; subject to $24,000 in import duties. Theater sets previously had been classified as works of art, and hence were duty-free. The Customs Service never has explained why, or when, theater sets had been reclassified.    Jane O'dell, customs consultant to the National Retail Merchants Association, says textile importers often face the most tedious customs tests. In one case, a customs officer insisted that ladies' slips with pearl buttons were evening gowns, and therefore subject to higher duty, because the pearl buttons meant &quot;no one would use this inside,&quot; Ms. O'dell says. </TEXT></DOC>
