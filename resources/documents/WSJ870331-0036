Texaco's attack on the very court before which it is seeking a new hearing suggests a growing unease within the company over the course of future state-court appeals. Indeed, James Kinnear, Texaco's newly elected president and chief executive officer, recently wrote a letter to employees likening Texaco's experience in its appeals to that of a &quot;mugging&quot; victim, or to someone &quot;run over&quot; by a taxicab.    But the company's filing yesterday, made with the state's First Supreme Judicial Court of Civil Appeals, Houston, made it plain that Texaco is doing everything possible to ripen the case for eventual U.S. Supreme Court jurisdiction, should the Texas Supreme Court refuse to overturn the judgment.    The oil company argued, for instance, that a $10,000 campaign contribution by a Pennzoil lawyer to one judge in the case, and the involvement of another trial judge &quot;who acted as if he were a Pennzoil captive,&quot; violated Texaco's constitutional right to due process. The appeals court's alleged misuse of New York contract law, which governs in the case, violates the constitutional mandate that one state give &quot;full faith and credit&quot; to the laws of another, Texaco argued. And the extraordinary damages award &quot;raises problems of a constitutional dimension, as well,&quot; Texaco said, including the Eighth Amendment prohibition against &quot;excessive fines.&quot;    White Plains, N.Y.-based Texaco is also counting heavily on a federal statute to prove that despite the jury findings in the case, Pennzoil could never have secured the binding merger agreement with Getty Oil Co. that Texaco was found to have illegally interfered with. Pennzoil had agreed to purchase Getty Oil shares from a major shareholder, the J. Paul Getty Museum, while it also had a tender offer outstanding for publicly owned shares -- an apparent violation of securities laws barring private stock purchases while a public offer is pending.    Houston-based Pennzoil has dismissed Texaco's argument as &quot;hypertechnical,&quot; explaining that Pennzoil easily could have obtained an exemption from the statute from the Securities and Exchange Commission. But Texaco claims that under the statute Pennzoil's &quot;contract&quot; remained unlawful, and that therefore Pennzoil &quot;has no case.&quot;    Joe Jamail, Pennzoil's lead outside lawyer, called Texaco's attempt to &quot;manufacture&quot; federal issues &quot;bush league.&quot; Another Pennzoil lawyer, G. Irvin Terrell, said, &quot;Texaco is trying to cast every state-law issue in the case as some sort of federal-law complaint, but the U.S. Supreme Court is not in the habit of adjudicating the laws of the 50 states.&quot;    But Texaco asserted that the appeals court opinion went far beyond violating Texaco's federal rights. Texaco insisted that the appeals-court opinion uses &quot;inconsistent reasoning&quot; and where necessary &quot;ducks the issue&quot; -- all, Texaco said, to achieve &quot;one consistent conclusion: Pennzoil always wins and Texaco always loses.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
