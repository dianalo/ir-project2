Four new border stations were opened on the Hungarian-Sovietborder March 1, and most restrictions on travel for people livingin the border area were lifted.   Hungary has introduced some of the most liberal travel laws inEastern Europe, allowing its citizens to travel as often as theycan afford to. Other East bloc countries still restrict travel oftheir citizens to other Soviet bloc countries.   According to the state news agency MTI, authorities expected nomore than 350,000 people to cross the Soviet-Hungarian borderbefore the end of the year. In the first three months, however, 1.5million people have crossed the border, MTI said. Customs officialsprocessed 98,000 passports on a single day recently, 90 percent ofwhich were Soviet, MTI said.   Shops in the border area have insufficient stocks of items inhigh demand among Soviet tourists: toothpaste, soap, deodorant,margarine and brandy, it said.   The news agency compared the onslaught of Soviet shoppingtourists to the ``invasion'' of Austria in recent months byHungarian shoppers stocking up on electronic items and householdappliances. Nearly 1 million Hungarians traveled to Austria in theweek preceding the introduction of new customs regulations in April.   There are too few currency exchange offices and gas stations inthe Soviet-Hungarian border area, MTI said. Makeshift markets haveappeared in parking lots near the border where money can beexchanged on the black market and some goods are sold from cartrunks, the news agency said.   Officials are to meet this week to discuss the opening of moreborder-crossing stations, MTI said.</TEXT></DOC>
