Under the provisions of 42 U.S.C. 10601(d)(2)(A)(4)(iii),of the first $100,000,000 deposited in the fund in a particular year, 1%shall be available for grants as provided in 42 U.S.C. 10603(c) for trainingand technical assistance services to eligible crime victim service programsand for the financial support of services to victims of Federal crime byeligible crime victim assistance programs. OVC has made support for victimassistance to Native Americans in Indian country the highest priority foruse of this 1% of the Crime Victims Fund. OVC will contribute $100,000of its funds for this effort.Under the provisions of 42 U.S.C. 3751, the Bureau of Justice Assistanceis authorized to make additional Federal financial assistance availableto public and private agencies and private nonprofit organizations forthe purposes of undertaking educational and training programs for criminaljustice personnel and providing technical assistance to States and localunits of government. The Director of the Bureau of Justice Assistance hastransferred $200,000 of discretionary grant funds authorized under Section508 (b) of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act, as amended,to the Office for Victims of crime to address the purposes mentioned below.In November 1988, the Office for Victims of Crime awarded grants to ninestates to provide assistance to Native Americans who are victims of crime.Eligibility was limited to those states where the United States Government,through such agencies as the Bureau of Indian Affairs, the Federal Bureauof Investigation, or the U.S. Attorney's office, has the authority to investigateor prosecute crime in Indian country. The nine states_Arizona, Michigan,North Dakota, Oregon, South Dakota, Utah, Washington, Wisconsin, and Wyoming_receiveda total of $1,004,500. The grants ranged from $35,500 to $250,500. Thestate-designated victim assistance agencies are in the process of awardingsubgrants to tribes and Native American organizations on reservations locatedin their states. These grants will enable tribes to address the pressingneeds of Native American victims of crime who have very limited accessto victim assistance services. It is anticipated that the states will eventuallyaward a total of approximately 30 subgrants. The Indian tribes will usethe funds for a variety of victim related programs including: sheltersfor abused women; crisis response to sexual assault victims; grief supportgroups; child abuse treatment; training for law enforcement officers formore effective responses to the needs of victims; and general victim serviceprograms. Most of these projects will operate until April 30, 1990.The response to the Office for Victims of Crime's first grant program toassist victims of Federal crime in Indian Country was so great that theOffice announced a second grant program. On March 17, 1989, a total of$700,000 of discretionary grant funds was made available for the same purposein the <T4>Federal Register</T4> (<T4>Federal Register</T4> Vol. 54, No. 51, p. 11304). The Office anticipatesawarding $700,000 to states that have not received an award under the previousannouncement. The Office for Victims of Crime will make 6-8 grant awardsto the states. These awards will range from $30,000 to $200,000.In another part of this <T4>Federal Register</T4> notice, the Office for Victims of Crime is alsomaking funds available to Native American Indian tribal organizations toassist them in developing or expanding programs that improve the handlingof child abuse cases, especially child sexual abuse cases.  <ITAG tagnum="84">Purpose  </ITAG>The Office for Victims of Crime is making $300,000 available to a publicor private nonprofit agency, or consortium of agencies, to provide technicalassistance and training to those Indian tribes and Native American organizationsthat have received a subgrant from either of the two <T3>Assistance to Victims of Federal Crime in Indian Country</T3> discretionarygrant programs or received a discretionary grant made as part of the <T3>Children's Justice Act Discretionary Grant Program for Native Americans.</T3>The Office is seeking to ensure that all Native American tribes that havereceived support under any one of these initiatives are provided the trainingand technical assistance necessary to start and successfully operate theirprograms.  The Office recognizes the difficulties inherent in the development of newvictim service programs and the need for technical support and trainingso that programs can achieve their stated goals and objectives. Severaldifferent approaches to providing technical assistance and training areneeded because there are a variety of different types of programs beingfunded and the tribes that are implementing the programs have varying features,including: size, location, availability of resources and services, culture,legal structure and law enforcement jurisdiction.  <ITAG tagnum="84">Program Description  </ITAG>One project will be funded under this initiative. The project must be capableof providing a wide range of training and technical assistance servicesto all Indian tribes and organizations that have received a grant fromthe Office for Victims of Crime under either the Assistance to Victimsof Federal Crime in Indian Country or the Children's Justice Act DiscretionaryGrant Program for Native Americans.  Within 45 days of the grant award,, the grantee will be expected to surveyall eligible Indian grantees to assess their training and technical assistanceneeds.  Within 60 days of the grant award, the grantee will be expected to categorizeand establish priorities for the training and technical assistance requested. Within 60 days of the grant award, the grantee will be expected to submitto the Office for Victims of Crime a comprehensive 12-month plan for thedevelopment and delivery of technical assistance and training. The planshould be based upon information collected during the survey phase of theproject and should include such information as: the types of technicalassistance to be provided; the steps necessary to adapt suitable resources,the location for providing the assistance; anticipated attendance at training;the reason such training/technical assistance was selected; the cost ofsuch training; the method of be used to assess the effectiveness of suchtraining; and the period during which the training/technical assistanceis to be provided. Within 60 days of the grant award, the grantee willalso be expected to submit a plan for the assessment and delivery of adhoc training and technical assistance requests.  The plan is subject to review and approval by OVC. If the initial planis rejected, the grantee will have 15 days from the receipt of OVC's noticeof rejection and comments to submit a revised plan which will also be subjectto OVC's review and approval. Within 15 days of OVC's final approval ofthe plan the grantee should begin to provide on-site training and technicalassistance.  The Office for Victims of Crime recognizes that the requests for trainingand technical assistance may exceed the availability of resources. Therefore,it is very important that the grantee develop a delivery plan which maximizesavailable resources. This could be done, in part, by: providing trainingand technical assistance on a regional basis; using other on-going trainingand technical assistance efforts to support this program's needs; usingtraining and technical assistance material; brochures and guides that arealready developed; establishing clear priorities for the provision of trainingand technical assistance; and utilizing trainers and technical assistanceproviders who are knowledgeable about Native American culture, custom andlaw.  While this project will operate for eighteen (18) months the Office forVictims of Crime anticipates that a majority of the training and technicalassistance efforts will take place during the first twelve (12) monthsof the grant. The Office's priority is to ensure that all projects havethe training and technical assistance necessary to begin operating effectively. <ITAG tagnum="84">Selection Criteria  </ITAG>In determining which applications to fund, the Office for Victims of Crimewill consider the following:  1.
