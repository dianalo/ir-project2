Fernando Collor de Mello of Alagoas in the impoverishedNortheast is attacting voter attention with a clean-governmentplatform and pro-business views in a nation deep in debt andravaged by inflation.   He is leading national public opinion polls by a 3-1 margin,outscoring two previous front-runners, long-time populist LeonelBrizola of the Democratic Labor Party and unionist Luis Inacio Lulada Silva of the radical left Workers Party.   Collor de Mello's supporters call him a bold reformer, capableof ``moralizing'' Brazil's bureaucracy.   Critics maintain he is a shallow, prefabricated candidate withhazy ideas and questionable financial dealings as governor ofAlagoas.   But his popularity grows, nevertheless.   In mid-July, Collor de Mello got a 41-percent rating in a surveyby one leading poll taker. Brizola, his closest rival, had 12percent and Da Silva wound up with 7 percent. A Gallup poll at thesame time gave Collor de Mello 45 percent, with Brizola remainingat 12 and Da Silva dropping to 5{ percent.   ``I reached this position without the support of any governor,senator, big businessman, banker or the military,'' Collor de Mellosaid after the poll results were released. ``My candidacy was bornin the sentiment of the nation.''   Brazilians will choose a successor to President Jose Sarney onNov. 15 in the first popular balloting for president in 29 years.Direct presidential elections were banned by a right-wing militaryregime that ruled from 1964 to 1985.   Collor de Mello presents himself as an independent candidatewithout ties to vested interests. He calls himself a ``Christianreformer'' and ideologically left of center.   However, his opponents call him ``the new face of the right.''His pro-business ideas are drawing conservatives to his newlyformed National Reconstruction Party.   Collor de Mello first attracted national attention when, asgovernor, he refused to pay the exorbitant salaries of an elitegroup of civil servants, popularly known as ``maharajas.''   His refusal struck a chord among Brazilians who read almostdaily accounts of official graft and corruption, while most workersearn close to the minimum wage of about $40 a month.   His clean-government crusade has become the heart of hispresidential campaign.   Collor de Mello has been a sharp critic of Sarney, a 59-year-oldrancher and poet who took office in 1985 when the military steppeddown. Many blame Sarney's government for 1,000 percent inflationand rampant corruption.   Collor de Mello was born Aug. 12, 1949, into a wealthy andpowerful family in Alagoas, a state dominated by sugar barons andknown for its bloody political feuds. In Alagoas, he heads thefamily owned Gazeta media group, which includes a newspaper, a TVstation, three radio stations and a publishing house.   His political career began when he joined the military regime'sSocial Democratic Party in the 1970s. In 1979 he was appointedmayor of Maceio, the capital of Alagoas. Three years later he waselected to Congress.   In 1985, Collor de Mello sided with the military and voted forthe party's presidential candidate, Paulo Maluf, in an electoralcollege election. He says it was a question of party loyalty, butthe vote still haunts him.   Maluf lost to opposition candidate Tancredo Neves, who diedbefore taking office. His running mate Sarney became president.   In 1986, Collor de Mello switched to Sarney's BrazilianDemocratic Movement Party and was elected governor. Last year heresigned from the party in a split with Sarney and began his runfor president.   As a candidate, Collor de Mello has made crowd-pleasing promisesto sell Cabinet ministers' mansions in Brasilia and to disband thefeared National Intelligence Service, a secret police operation.   He claims Brazil's $112 billion foreign debt, the largest in theThird World, is ``unpayable,'' but he adds that he will not stoppayments on it. Instead, he proposes withdrawing the federalgovernment's guarantees on loans for state-run companies and stategovernments.   ``My proposal is unconventional,'' he says. ``I don't intend towelsh or declare a moratorium. I want to play within the rules.Withdrawing federal guarantees will send a signal to creditors thatwill promote a broad renegotiation.''   A top priority, he says, is attracting more foreign investment.   ``We need money, we need investment, we need development,'' hesaid.   ``I don't think like some who see in foreign capital thepresence of the dominator, the colonizer. That's a mistaken view.The only way to development is to establish a healthy partnershipwith capital.''   He also proposes to eliminate the controversial ``marketreserve'' policy that bars large numbers of foreign-made computersfrom Brazil.   ``This is backwardness, clientelism, paternalism,'' he said.``If we're going to install capitalism here, then let's do it allthe way. And this is anything but capitalism.''   Critics claim Collor de Mello's record belies his claims as acorruption fighter.   As governor, Collor de Mello made a settlement considered overlygenerous in a tax dispute with the state's sugar barons. And heappointed thousands to state jobs on the eve of his resignation torun for president.   Justice Minister Oscar Dias Correa ordered federal police toinvestigate the charges of corruption.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Fri PMs July 28</NOTE></DOC>
