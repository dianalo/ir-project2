At next week's meeting of the Federal Open MarketCommittee, officials expect little disagreement on thequestion of interest-rate policy for the coming weeks. Withsigns of economic recovery proliferating, the group is likelyto be unanimous in favoring no changes in short-term interestrates for now.</LP><TEXT>   But the Fed panel must also adopt money targets for nextyear during the meeting. With money growth becoming anincreasingly important guide to Fed policy, those targetscould hold the key to future economic growth and inflation.   The Fed is required by law to provide Congress with itsmoney-supply targets. In past years, those targets havesometimes seemed mere window dressing, which policy makersfelt free to ignore.   In the last two years, however, the importance of moneysupply has risen in internal Fed debates. Slow money growthhas repeatedly been cited as a principal reason for the Fed'scredit-easing moves, and the money numbers are being watchedclosely by Fed officials ranging from Cleveland Fed PresidentLee Hoskins, a leading advocate of tight-credit policies, toFed Gov. David Mullins, who in the year since joining the Fedhas led the push for easier credit.   At issue is whether to reduce the target range for annualgrowth in M2, which is the most closely watched money-supplymeasure and consists of cash, checking accounts and certainsavings accounts. Currently, that range is 2 1/2% to 6 1/2%.Over the last few years, the Fed has tried to gradually lowerits target range as a signal of its commitment to reducinginflation. Some Fed officials, eager to reinforce thatcommitment, would like to reduce the targets again to, say,2% to 6%.   But other Fed officials worry the lower range would forcethe Fed to follow a tight money policy that could choke offeconomic growth. And some outside economists even argue thatthe Fed needs to raise its targets in order to ensure ahealthy recovery.   Martin Feldstein, former chairman of President Reagan'sCouncil of Economic Advisers, wrote recently in the editorialpages of this newspaper that money needs to grow at an 8%annual rate -- well above the top of the Fed's target -- justto ensure a moderate 3% economic growth rate in the comingmonths.   Stephanie Murphy, an economist with Manufacturers HanoverSecurities Co., also believes money needs to grow at a 7% or8% rate. &quot;Lowering the target would be a big mistake and justabout guarantee a double-dip recession,&quot; she says. In adouble-dip recession, economic growth plunges again after ashort period of rebound.   Behind this debate is a monetary theory that says everynew dollar the Fed creates will be used either to buy moregoods and services -- which increases economic growth -- orto bid up prices -- which increases inflation. Thus, moneygrowth of 6% would allow for 2% growth and a 4% inflationrate, or, alternatively, 3% growth and a 3% inflation rate.   Since the first of this year, money growth has hovered atabout a 4% rate. But inflation has also hovered just under4%, leaving little room, Fed critics say, for any economicgrowth. Moreover, some economists believe the Fed needs togenerate additional money growth to make up for the slowgrowth in previous years. &quot;What concerns me is that the lastfive years have seen the lowest growth in M2 in 30 years,&quot;says Lacy Hunt, chief economist for Hongkong Bank Group.   The problem with this simple analysis is that therelationship between money growth on the one hand andeconomic growth and inflation on the other isn't very stable.It can change from time to time, reflecting variations insomething economists call &quot;velocity&quot; -- which is the numberof times a dollar changes hands in one year. If velocityrises for some reason, 4% growth in money could translateinto economic growth plus inflation that well exceeds 4%.   In testimony to the Senate Banking Committee on June 14,Mr. Mullins -- who is slated to become the Federal ReserveBoard's vice chairman -- said he thought money growth in the&quot;four to five percent area will be more than sufficient toaccommodate the economic activity foreseen in the rebound.&quot;He argued that velocity normally speeds up during an economicrecovery.   But Fed officials admit their record at forecastingchanges in velocity is mixed, at best. And Ms. Murphy saidyou have to go all the way back to 1961 to &quot;find a recoveryaccompanied by a rise in velocity.&quot;   White House economist Lawrence Lindsey, who has beennominated by President Bush for one of two vacant Fedgovernor seats, would probably have been a voice for fastermoney-supply growth if allowed to attend next week's meeting.He has made it clear in public statements that he focuses onproviding enough money growth to allow for adequate economicgrowth.   But the Senate Banking Committee has been dragging itsfeet on confirming Mr. Lindsey's nomination. BankingCommittee Chairman Donald Riegle (D., Mich.) is clearlyunenthusiastic about Mr. Lindsey, and Sen. Terry Sanford (D.,N.C.) has circulated a letter opposing the nomination.Committee aides nevertheless predict a vote soon afterCongress returns from its July Fourth holiday.   The money growth ranges decided on next week will berevealed when Mr. Greenspan testifies to Congress later nextmonth.</TEXT></DOC>
