Large pro-democracy demonstrations also were reported in severalother cities. In Shanghai, more than 300,000 people rallied on thewaterfront of the Huangpu River and 200,000 more gathered in thecity's People's Square.   The only violence reported was a clash between armed police andstudents in western Beijing on Saturday in which students said theywere attacked with electric cattle prods. One student injured inthe attack said 45 students were hospitalized.   The thousands of students staging a week-old hunger strike inthe 100-acre Tiananmen Square ended their fast Saturday, sayingthey needed to regain their strength in case troops moved in.   Students and their supporters in the square early Sundaynumbered about 200,000. Protests since the hunger strike began havedrawn hundreds of thousands.   The hunger strikers initially demanded a dialogue with thegovernment on reform, to be broadcast live, and an apology for aninitial official declaration that the student democracy movementwas a plot against the party.   But after Premier Li Peng declared martial law in parts of thecapital Saturday to put an end to the protests, most students andtheir supporters demanded Li resign.   The army's move Sunday apparently was aimed at stopping the flowof tens of thousands of people to the capital to join the protests.Citizens blockaded the station by parking coal trucks across theroad and hundreds of students sat in front of it as a furtherbarrier.   The army set up roadblocks around the capital about 12 milesfrom the city center, said a Chinese source who spoke on conditionof anonymity.   The source said 60,000 to 70,000 troops moved into the citycenter by subway Sunday and followed connecting tunnels to thewalled palace, the history museum and the Great Hall of the Peopleon three sides of Tiananmen Square. The subway was closed toregular traffic as of noon Saturday.   There was no outward sign of the reported troop presence in thecity center and it could not be confirmed.   Inside Tiananmen Square, the sun rose Sunday on a triumphant butweary and bedraggled crowd of at least 200,000 students, medicalworkers and ordinary citizens. The students spent the night sittingin rows with gauze wound around their mouths and noses forprotection against a possible tear gas attack.   Around the square and on roads throughout the city, citizensbarricaded the way with buses, trucks and anything available.Thousands also surrounded tanks and trucks filled with soldiers atseveral points in the suburbs, immobilizing them.   ``The people are strong,'' an elderly woman marveled as the longnight ended peacefully.   But soon after, five army helicopters swooped twice over thesquare as they did repeatedly Saturday, reminding the protestersthe standoff was not over. The students waved and cheered defiantly.   ``The danger is not over,'' said a medical student who washelping care for about 3,000 of the students who were weakened bythe hunger strike.   Student leaders had said over a loudspeaker Saturday night thatthe protesters should not resist if the army came.   ``Our principle is peaceful non-resistance,'' they said.   On Sunday, the student leaders held lengthy, private meetings todiscuss their next step. Nothing was immediately announced. Somereportedly favored staying in the square while others wanted tojoin citizens confronting army vehicles.   The widely ignored martial law regulations include bans onmarches, class boycotts, distribution of pamphlets, speeches, thespreading of rumors, attacks on party, government or militaryorgans and ``any other destructive actions.''   Li's hard-line stand toward the students appears to have forcedthe resignation of the more liberal Communist Party GeneralSecretary Zhao Ziyang.   Chinese sources said Zhao, highly respected for his pioneeringwork in economic reforms, resigned his post after failing topersuade Li and senior leader Deng Xiaoping to compromise with thestudents. There has been no official word on Zhao's future.   Li's political victory could be brief, however, if the militaryrefuses to cooperate in the crackdown.   Britain on Saturday urged that the Chinese government anddemonstrators use ``restraint and moderation'' in the crisis. TheUnited States and France recommended that their citizens not travelto the country.   Protesters in Beijing have demanded Deng retire.   Deng, 84, is widely admired for initiating market-orientedreforms in China. But he has come under sharp attack by studentsfor holding onto power too long and letting political reform lagbehind his economic reforms.   The students began the protests on April 15 after the death offormer Communist Party chief Hu Yaobang, a leading reformer who wasousted from his post for not cracking down on earlier studentprotests.   The rallies gradually grew in size as workers and others joinedin and evolved into the biggest show of defiance in China's 40years of communist rule.</TEXT></DOC>
