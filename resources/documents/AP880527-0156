Gorbachev is sending an unmistakeable signal thathe intends to seize the initiative during the pair's Moscowface-off.   The challenge facing Reagan as he awaits the start of the summitSunday is to maintain his well-rehearsed game plan _ or to alter itto compete with the Soviet leader.   The Soviets already have scrambled the schedule for the talksopening Monday and apparently imposed restraints on some of thepeople who hoped to meet with Reagan.   One of two summit sessions scheduled for Monday was scrubbed,although the time allotted for the two leaders to meet _ 6 hours _was maintained.   The Soviets gave no specific explanation, saying an ``internalfunction'' required the cancellation.   The White House, puzzled at first, decided to describe thedecision as ``mutual'' and not make a fuss.   Moreover, Gorbachev will take the unprecedented step of holdinga news conference next Wednesday, the day before the summit ends,according to an official Soviet source who spoke only on conditionhe not be identified.   Never before has a general secretary of the Soviet CommunistParty met formally with reporters on home territory, the sourcesaid.   Meanwhile, a Leningrad ``refusenik,'' Roald Zelichenok, said ina telephone interview that KGB secret police had warned him againstaccepting an invitation to meet Reagan on Monday.   The Jewish dissident, who has been refused permission toemigrate to Israel for more than 10 years, said he was told ``inlight of security measures'' around Moscow, he would not bepermitted to leave Leningrad.   There were reports, too, that some of the church officials dueto meet Reagan at the Danilov monastery also were being kept away.   The White House said Thursday that everyone invited to attendboth gatherings would be there.   And in Moscow, officials showed no concern over the meetings andsought to minimize their impact.   Vladimir F. Petrovsky said ``the U.S. President ... is certainlyfree to decide who of Soviet citizens he finds interesting anduseful to meet with outside the framework of the official events.''   But, he added, ``this American move is hardly aimed at improvingmutual understanding between the U.S.A. and the U.S.S.R.''   Reagan has arranged for Howard H. Baker Jr., the White Housechief of staff, to make a flight to Helsinki with the text of thetreaty the two leaders signed last December in Washington toabolish land-based nuclear ballistic and cruise missiles in therange of 300 to 3,4000 miles. The Senate is in the final stages ofratifying the pact.   If the Senate acts in time, Baker on Saturday will bring theinstruments of ratification with him to Helsinki. They will bepresented in ceremonial exchange with Gorbachev. Reagan intends touse the occasion to extol the agreement _ his only dent in thenuclear arms race in 7{ years in office.   Gorbachev clearly has another agenda in mind for the summit, onethat does not focus on human rights _ or even arms control.   With negotiations stymied on a bigger treaty to reducelong-range nuclear weapons, Gorbachev is looking elsewhere to givethe summit some substance. His sights are focused on regionalhotspots, and he has begun to make his moves.   The first, of course, was completing an agreement in Geneva towithdraw the Soviet troops that have occupied Afghanistan since1979.   The second was the word passed by Vietnam, a Soviet ally, thatit would withdraw 50,000 soldiers from Cambodia. Gorbachev's thirdmove, which could come at the summit or directly afterward, is theprospective withdrawal of 50,000 to 100,000 Soviet troops fromEastern Europe.   These bold initiatives are bound to win Gorbachev points forpeace around the world. And they could put Reagan on the defensivein Moscow.   Two years ago, at the Iceland summit, Reagan was forced torespond to Gorbachev's arms control initiatives.   This time, the president may have to adjust his script to theSoviet leader's oneupsmanship on the ground.</TEXT><HEAD>___</HEAD><HEAD>EDITOR'S NOTE: Barry Schweid will cover his seventh U.S.-Soviet</HEAD><TEXT>   summit for The Associated Press, in Moscow starting Sunday.</TEXT><HEAD>___</HEAD></DOC>
