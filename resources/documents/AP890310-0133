Lt. Col. Yuriy Nikolayevich Pakhtusov, 35, was told to leaveThursday. An FBI investigation had led to his arrest Wednesdaynight, just a day after the Bush administration opened a high-leveldialogue with the Soviet Union.   Pakhtusov was described by a U.S. source as a significant catchbecause he is a member of the Red Army's GRU intelligence arm. Oneofficial said Pakhtusov was caught ``red-handed.''   But the Soviet Embassy issued a statement saying the expulsionorder ``could be only qualified as a deliberate provocation againsta Soviet diplomatic official.''   It denied that Pakhtusov engaged in any wrongdoing and said theembassy has lodged a ``resolute protest'' with the State Department.   Asked about the Soviet allegations today, department spokesmanCharles Redman said, ``The reason for our actions is very simple. Hewas caught red-handed with the goods and no amount of verbiage canchange that.''   Redman added that the Soviets have informed the United Statesthat Pakhtusov will be leaving as requested.   He said there is no reaosn to believe the incident will affectU.S.-Soviet relations. The Soviets are aware that the United Stateswill protect its national security interests whenever it'sthreatened, he said.   State Department press officer Dennis Harter said the SovietEmbassy was informed that Pakhtusov was being expelled for``activities incompatible with his diplomatic status.''   According to one government source, Pakhtusov was asked to leaveby Saturday.   Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov called theexpulsion a ``gross provocation'' at a regularly scheduled newsbriefing today in Moscow, but he did not announce any retaliatorySoviet action.   He said ``the U.S. side is assuming all the responsibilities'' ofthe decision to expel Pakhtusov.   Repeatedly asked by reporters whether Pakhtusov was engaged inspying, Gerasimov responded: ``He did not violate diplomatic statuswith whatever he did.''   Violating diplomatic status is an oft-used diplomatic euphemismfor spying.   In Vienna on Tuesday, Secretary of State James A. Baker III metfor the first time with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A.Shevardnadze and announced plans for a visit to Moscow in May.   The FBI probe was set in motion in August, two months afterPakhtusov's arrival, when he approached an American employee of acompany that deals in classified information.   The American, who was not identified, reported the contact to theFBI, which began monitoring contacts between the two.   There is growing evidence that the Soviets are placing highpriority on gaining access to Western computers with sensitivemilitary, nuclear and space research information stored inside them.   A week ago, West German authorities charged a computer hackerwith espionage and said a total of eight people were suspected ofselling sensitive computer data from the United States and alliedcountries to the Soviets from 1986 through last year.   The German action was described by officials as the firstconfirmed case of Soviet computer espionage. A State Departmentofficial, who asked not to be identified, said there was noconnection between the German and Pakhtusov cases.   From Moscow the official Soviet news agency Tass today expressedoutrage at the expulsion and reported that Pakhtusov was arrestedwhile taking out the garbage at his home in Virginia.   Neither Tass nor other Soviet media said whether there would beany retaliatory action taken against Americans in the Soviet Union.   Soviet interest in penetrating Western computer banks has added anew dimension to the ongoing effort to make stored data securewithout making it inaccessible to those with a legitimate need forit.   Previously, the problem had been limited to hackers who try topenetrate computers as a hobby.   Pakhtusov is the first publicly acknowledged case of a Sovietenvoy being expelled by the United States since December 1987, whenMikhail Kathov, second secretary at the Soviet mission to the UnitedNations, was ordered home for trying to obtain information onmilitary technology.   In September 1986, the Reagan administration, alleging widespreadspying activities, ordered the expulsion in stages of 105 Sovietsfrom Moscow's U.N. mission. The Soviets retaliated by expelling anumber of American diplomats from Moscow.</TEXT></DOC>
