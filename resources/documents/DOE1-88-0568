A novel diapiric instability is proposed to occur if the oceanthins enough, mixing these layers and perhaps leading to resurfacingand groove formation. Rising warm-ice diapirs may cause a dramatic heatpulse and fracturing at the surface, and provide material for surfaceflows. Timing of the pulse depends on ice rheology but could agree withcrater-density dates for resurfacing. Origins of the Ganymede-Callistodichotomy in light of the model are discussed. Based on estimates ofthe conductivity of H{sub 2} (Jupiter, Saturn) and H{sub 2}O (Uranus,Neptune), the zonal winds of the giant planets will, if they penetratebelow the visible atmosphere, interact with the magnetic field well outsidethe metallic core. The scaling argument is supported by a model withzonal velocity constant on concentric cylinders, the Lorentz torque oneach balanced by viscous stresses. The problem of two-dimensional photoclinometry,i.e. reconstruction of a surface from its image, is formulated in termsof finite elements and a fast algorithm using Newton-SOR iteration acceleratedby multigridding is presented.</TEXT></DOC>
