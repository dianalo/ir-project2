Police arrested 77 people, the government radio announced.   The radio said six policemen and three demonstrators were killedand that 10 students and three women were among those arrested.Dozens were injured, it said.   The radio said the restrictions would last until Aug. 19.   On Tuesday, students from the Rangoon Arts and ScienceUniversity surged into the streets after authorities closed thatand other institutions.   The students had for the past week been peacefully demonstratingfor the release of detained students and the legalization ofstudent unions.   The one-party regime of Ne Win did not give in to the demands,and as it did against similar rioting in March, dispatched securityunits to swiftly quell the disturbances.   Ne Win, a socialist, has ruled this Southeast Asian nation withan iron hand since seizing power in a 1962 military coup.   The government earlier said five policemen were killed and 26seriously wounded ``as a result of an attack by an unruly mob armedwith swords, sticks and catapults.''   It said one rioter was killed and several wounded.   Government radio said the mob set fire to one police station andthe family quarters of another station and damaged government-ownedmovie theaters and traffic lights.   Authorities today suspended classes at three more institutionswhere students had staged peaceful rallies: the Institute ofMedicine, the Institute of Dental Science and the Rangoon Instituteof Technology.   There was no apparent extra security on the streets, which werecalm but with less traffic. Few people went to offices or schools.Markets were open but had few customers. Local officials went intoresidential areas warning people not to gather in groups of five ormore.   Witnesses said the fighting began as about 1,000 students of thearts and science university marched toward downtown Rangoon, withhigh school students joining them.   They said about 200 police officers swung batons and hurledstones to stop the marchers near the Singaporean embassy, about twomiles south of the campus.   The demonstrators, by then about 5,000 strong, hurled stones andother objects and forced the police to retreat a block south, wherea strong military barricade stood. The protesters then dispersedinto small lanes.   Sporadic clashes also were reported in the nearby Sanchaung areaof the city, where security personnel were said to have used teargas and firearms.   It was the worst rioting in the city since March 18, whenseveral days of student unrest at two universities climaxed in arampage by students and other protesters that was swiftly crushedby police and military units.   Diplomatic sources told reporters in Bangkok, Thailand, that asmany as 100 people may have died in the March 18 violence. Agovernment panel announced only two deaths, both students it saidwere shot by riot police.</TEXT></DOC>
