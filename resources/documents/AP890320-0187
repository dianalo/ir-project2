The soldiers were patrolling on foot near the town of LaCongolona, 100 miles southeast of Tegucigalpa, when they stepped onthe mines Thursday, according to armed forces spokesman Col. ManuelSuarez Benavides.   Military teams worked over the weekend to clear mines from a20-square-mile area at the border, he said.   ``The Sandinista army has intensified the mining of differentHonduran border zones with Nicaragua by making rapid incursions intoour territory with what appears to be an attitude of provocation,''Suarez Benavides said.   ``To avoid acts that we would later regret, the decision was madenot to permit journalists to enter Yamales.'' The area is along theYamales River, 102 miles east of Tegucigalpa; the road to Yamalesruns to within 200 yards of the border with Nicaragua in some places.   Contra rebels, who have operated from camps in Honduras since1981, also are known have planted mines when retreating across theborder.   Nicaraguan officials had no immediate comment. The two countriesregularly exchange accusations on border incidents.   Also Monday, Foreign Ministry spokesman Eugenio Castro Claramountsaid at least 14 Hondurans are among the 1,894 former Nicaraguannational guardsmen released last week in Nicaragua. He said theywill soon be returning to Tegucigalpa.   The Nicaraguan army reported 20 incidents of harassment fromHonduran troops across the border from Teotecacinte, near theYamales area, this year. No casualties were reported.   About 11,000 Contra rebels and their families retreated to basecamps in Honduras after the United States cut off military aid abouta year ago. They have been receiving food, medical supplies andother non-lethal U.S. aid.   For many years access to the camps was strictly restricted by theHonduran government, but foreign journalists have been able to visitthe camps frequently in recent months, usually traveling there byroad from Tegucigalpa.</TEXT></DOC>
