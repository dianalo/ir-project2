He is brave and cunning. Neither rivers nor deserts nor barbed-wire fences can stop him.    Yet this hero is on the run. He is haunted by troubles in his unhappy homeland and hunted by enemies in his inhospitable new land.    The hero is the illegal alien.    Long a major economic and political issue, illegal immigration is now emerging as the latest saga in Western folklore. As the protagonists of a passel of songs, movies and stories, illegal immigrants have inherited a mythological range once belonging to the cowboy, the outlaw and the oil man.    At KLAT in Houston, the city's largest Spanish-language radio station, Armando Reyna rarely finishes his listener-request show without a song from such popular groups as Los Ilegales (the Illegal Aliens), La Migra (the Immigration Officers) or Los Ramaleros (Those That Hide in the Bushes).    Like the names of their creators, many immigration ballads sound like the sort of radio fare one would expect to hear only on the police band. In his studio swivel chair, Mr. Reyna waxes nostalgic about such hits as &quot;Los Alambrados&quot; (&quot;The Wire Jumpers&quot;) and &quot;No Necesito Coyote&quot; (&quot;I Don't Need a Smuggler&quot;.    &quot;This is what the people want to hear,&quot; he says. &quot;It's about their daily lives.&quot;    For the same reason, Mexican film makers have found a profitable niche exporting movies and videocassettes about illegal immigration to the Southwest. &quot;They're like B movies,&quot; says Maria Herrera-Sobek, a folklore expert at the University of California at Irvine. &quot;The Mexicans pump them out and sell them in the Southwest because they know the illegals are better able to afford them than most of the people who stayed in Mexico.&quot;    Immigration has even landed on the funny pages. For three years, a Spanish-language paper in Houston touched its immigrant subscribers very close to home with a fatalistically comical cartoon strip called &quot;Zopilote and Mr. Migra.&quot; Zopilote, a luckless would-be immigrant, and Mr. Migra, his obsessive pursuer from the immigration service, do for northern migration what Bugs Bunny and Elmer Fudd do for hunting.    In this comic strip, however, the hunter always gets his man. In one adventure, Zopilote tries to sneak across the border by hiding inside a pinata. His scheme appears to be successful until the papier-mache decoration is purchased and cracked open for the toys and candy normally inside it by, you guessed it, Mr. Migra. In other rough crossings, Zopilote is reeled out of the Rio Grande with a fishing rod, frozen inside an ice block in a railroad refrigerator car, and stranded inside an unclaimed package at a post office.    Zopilote made his last sally north some months ago when the newspaper folded, and his disappearance greatly disappointed fans from the Houston barrio all the way to SoHo in New York. &quot;A woman called from New York and wanted to buy up all of the originals,&quot; says the strip's creator, Eduardo Licon, who was born in Mexico and for a time lived here as an illegal himself.    Folklore experts say illegal immigration is just the latest variation on a long-running theme: the struggle between Anglos and Latinos for control of the Southwest. &quot;Illegal immigrants have always been subjects of the folklore -- it's just that before now the illegals spoke German and English and came to Texas from the North,&quot; says Juan Bruce-Novoa, a professor of foreign languages at Trinity University in San Antonio.    Even today, many songs, such as &quot;Viven Los Mojados&quot; (&quot;Hooray for the Wetbacks&quot;), carry clear warnings about the dire effects of tighter immigration controls. &quot;When the wetback decides not to ever return,&quot; the song says, &quot;who is going to take care of the onion fields, the lettuce and the beets, the lemon and the grapefruit? All will rot in their place.&quot;    Other songs reflect the immigrants' nostalgia for their abandoned homelands. In &quot;Jaula de Oro&quot; (&quot;The Golden Cage&quot;), an illegal Mexican immigrant finds that moving to the U.S. has raised his income but robbed him of his native culture: His Americanized children no longer speak to him in Spanish. &quot;I'm like a prisoner in this great nation,&quot; he laments.    Still other singers play the immigrant dilemma for laughs. In one song, an illegal suffering from the poverty of Mexico escapes to the U.S. by marrying an American woman. But his new wife's atrocious cooking only increases his deprivation. &quot;Every day,&quot; the singer moans, &quot;was a fast like Lent.&quot;    Only a few of the various immigration themes appearing in the Latino media have been picked up in the mainstream Anglo media. Hollywood, for example, has made several films about illegal immigration, but most have merely updated stereotypical characterizations of the villainous Southern lawman.    Typical is a 1982 film called &quot;The Border.&quot; It stars Jack Nicholson as an immigration officer newly transferred to El Paso, where his colleagues are said to be &quot;so dumb they can't roll a rock down a hill.&quot; He quickly discovers, however, that they are savvy enough -- and unscrupulous enough -- to smuggle aliens for pay, murder competing smugglers and kidnap Mexican babies. Mr. Nicholson manages to break up the smuggling ring and recover a kidnapped child -- though he can't possibly salvage the overdrawn plot.    A more ambitious treatment of immigration came in &quot;El Norte,&quot; an independently made 1984 film about the painful adjustment of two Guatemalan illegals transplanted into glitzy Southern California. The movie was widely acclaimed for its portrayal of the culture shock that immigrants encounter in even the most mundane aspects of American life. After getting a job as a maid, one of the Guatemalans is so perplexed by the rows of dials and buttons on her employer's washing machine that she does the laundry by hand and lays it out to dry on the grass.    The recently passed Simpson-Rodino immigration law, under which businesses knowingly hiring illegals can be fined, may be as much of a threat to the illegals as barbed wire was to the cowboys of the open range.    But it hasn't damped immigration-inspired creativity. Earlier this month, a Mexican comedian opened a satirical play called &quot;The Simpson Law Doesn't Bother Me&quot; before an audience of about 100 Latinos in heavily Hispanic north Houston. He portrayed an illegal construction worker who is &quot;commissioned&quot; to buy lunch for his crew and, through a misunderstanding, is mistaken for the new &quot;commissioner&quot; of the immigration service.    &quot;The law is good for a laugh,&quot; says Javier Soto, an illegal immigrant in the audience. &quot;But in real life, they will never stop the illegal.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
