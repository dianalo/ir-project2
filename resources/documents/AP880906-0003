The protesters, who were in rubber dinghies,, were charged withdisorderly conduct after the incident Monday.   They tried to hang onto the hull of the USS Brewton, which wasmoored near Albany off the southern coast of Western Australia.   Cmdr. Kraig Kennedy, the Brewton's commander, said hoses wereturned on the protesters because they planned to deface the vesselwith spray paint. Earlier, the three attached a banner to the ship.   Kennedy said the action may have been ``heavy-handed'' but thatevery precaution was taken to prevent injury.   Jo Vallentine, a member of Parliament and an activist in theParty for Nuclear Disarmament, demanded an apology, saying oneprotester was treated at a hospital for an eye injury and facialbruises.   `I believe it is the U.S. Navy that should be charged withdisorderly conduct,'' she told reporters after a meeting withKennedy.</TEXT></DOC>
