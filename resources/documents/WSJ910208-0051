Testifying before the House Armed Services Committee,Defense Secretary Dick Cheney gave his most upbeat assessmentyet of how long the conflict is likely to last. He alsoexplained why top Pentagon officials are convinced they won'tneed to worry about shipping in replacements for the 500,000troops currently in the Gulf.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;I'd be very reluctant now to start rotating units home&quot;until the fighting ends, Mr. Cheney told the lawmakers,because that would deprive commanders of &quot;the maximum forceavailable&quot; to defeat Iraq quickly. &quot;But I am hopeful that'snot going to take too awful long, and then we'll be able tobring units home&quot; permanently.   Mr. Cheney didn't provide any specifics. But otherhigh-ranking Defense Department officials said the latestinternal plans envision major portions of the American forcereturning to the U.S. or bases in Europe by the summer if thebattle plan proceeds as anticipated. Many of the soldiershave been deployed in Saudi Arabia since August, and mostplanners agree that a year is the maximum amount of time theycan remain before some replacement policy needs to be putinto place.   Meanwhile, the Bush administration, determined todemonstrate its anger at a harsh speech delivered Wednesdayby King Hussein, announced that it has decided to reviewwhether to continue economic aid to Jordan. Although theamount of aid affected -- about $55 million a year -- isn'tgreat, the decision is a telling sign of how fast U.S.relations with Jordan and other Arab countries sympathetic toIraq have deteriorated.   King Hussein, while officially opposing Iraq's invasion ofKuwait, has been highly critical of the U.S.-led militarycoalition assembled in Saudi Arabia. He leveled his mostvitriolic attack yet on the alliance this week, when hedeclared that the allied air campaign against Iraq amountedto an unjustified attack on all Arab and Muslim people.   While Jordan remains an irritant, the comments of bothSecretary Cheney and Secretary of State James Baker, whotestified at a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearingyesterday, indicate that top Bush advisers already areformulating policies that look beyond the end of theconflict.   Mr. Baker, for example, made it clear that Iraq'streatment after the war, especially the issue of U.S.assistance in any reconstruction effort, will depend onwhether Saddam Hussein remains in power. &quot;There's nosuggestion on our part,&quot; he said, &quot;that the reconstruction ofIraq could proceed if the current leadership remains inpower.&quot;   Even if Iraq changes leaders, Secretary Baker testified,most of the money for postwar reconstruction would have to beraised among the Arab oil states themselves, not the U.S.Treasury. The secretary also proposed the creation of aMiddle East development bank, to help poor Arab countriesafter the war.   Separately, a senior administration official said the U.S.intends to do everything it can to ensure that Saddam Husseindoesn't emerge from this war as a hero in the Arab world. Theofficial insisted that eliminating Saddam Hussein still isn'ta &quot;war objective&quot; and that U.S. forces aren't trying to killhim. Still, he acknowledged that the U.S. has attackedcommand and control centers where the Iraqi leader might havebeen located.   Mr. Cheney, looking toward the future, strongly suggestedthat one way to maintain long-term stability in the Gulf maybe to store large amounts of U.S. military hardware in theregion permanently. Acknowledging that the Pentagon &quot;hasprobably been derelict in not spending&quot; enough time andresources to improve shipping capabilities, the defense chiefsaid, &quot;it may well be that we can reduce our (shipping)requirements if we make some wise decisions aboutpre-positioning equipment&quot; in the region.   In the Persian Gulf, the massive oil spill has begunwashing ashore near oil-production facilities anddesalination plants near Safaniya, on Saudi Arabia'snortheast coast. Because water from the desalination plantsis used to lower the salt content of oil produced in thearea, wells producing up to half of the field's daily outputof 1.6 million barrels could be affected. However, if one ofthe two desalination plants there could be kept operating,some water could be available for continued production. TheSafaniya field is the largest offshore oil field in theworld.   Moreover, the slick continues to move down the coastlineto Jubail and Ras Tannurah, the site of major loadingfacilities for oil exports as well as two major oilrefineries and water-desalination plants that providedrinking water for the Saudi capital of Riyadh.   At the front, where U.S. planes continued to pound Iraqipositions, there were new signs of damage to Iraqi defenses.While the intelligence community remains more cautious thanthe Pentagon in its assessment of the air campaign, thelatest indications are that the allies have suppressed thestill-large Iraqi air defense system.   Attack planes are now making multiple runs at a target,whereas in the case of heavy anti-aircraft fire, a pilottypically will make a single run and try to escape beforebeing targeted by enemy gunners. Jets are coming in at loweraltitudes, judging from changes in weaponry, and thesuccessful use of the A-10, a slow-flying plane, supports thenotion that it is safer to come nearer Iraqi troop positionsthan during earlier phases of the campaign.   In assessing the bombardment, attention has focused on themost visible targets. Pictures of collapsed bridges or burnttanks are graphic evidence of the impact of the air war. Butfrom a military standpoint, the continued strength of Iraq'sartillery may be more important if allied troops are sentinto ground action.   In Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, the British commander in theGulf, Gen. Sir Peter de la Billiere, called the current levelof allied bombing &quot;minor compared to what they have gotcoming.&quot; He told reporters that a ground war is &quot;inevitable,&quot;but said &quot;there are going to be massive air attacks on themover the weeks ahead until the ground war goes in -- it isgoing to be unrelenting and it is going to be designed todestroy that army on the ground unless it pulls out.&quot;   In yesterday's bombing, Iraq's elite Republican Guard innorthern Kuwait continued to take a pounding, while strikeswere stepped up against front-line regular Iraqi forcescloser to Saudi Arabia. The U.S. command said 600 air sortieswere flown against southern Kuwait.   The U.S. also reported the loss of a Navy F-18 fighter,though the military said it didn't appear the plane had beenhit by enemy fire. An American UH-1 helicopter also crashed,from non-combat causes.   ---   David Rogers contributed to this article.</TEXT></DOC>
