Robert Lichter </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><TEXT>   The shock of Michigan has forced the Democratic Party to take Jesse Jackson seriously. Will it have the same effect on the media? Jesse Jackson's detractors say the media give him a free ride. His supporters reply that he rides on the back of the bus. Until recently both were right. Mr. Jackson has always been portrayed as a desirable candidate but not a viable one. Recently, however, television has given his campaign a turbo charge.    In 1984, despite the &quot;Hymietown&quot; controversy, Mr. Jackson got more coverage and better press than any other Democratic primary candidate, according to a study by political scientists Henry Broady and Richard Johnston. Yet a recent report by the Joint Center for Political Studies concludes that TV news didn't treat Mr. Jackson as a legitimate contender, but as a &quot;horse of a different color.&quot; The JCPS report charges that media skepticism became a self-fulfilling prophecy &quot;guaranteeing&quot; Mr. Jackson's loss.    So what's the story on Jesse Jackson in 1988? My ongoing study of network evening news election coverage shows it started out as a rerun of 1984. Until the New Hampshire primary, on-air evaluations of Mr. Jackson were 90% positive, a level matched only by media favorite Bruce Babbitt. Unfortunately, his horse-race coverage also resembled Mr. Babbitt's. A majority of reports on Mr. Jackson's prospects were negative, compared with more than 50% upbeat coverage for Michael Dukakis.    After New Hampshire, though, TV news noticed Mr. Jackson was running stronger among whites than he had in 1984, and his viability ratings soared to 90% positive. Since New Hampshire, for the first time in his career, Mr. Jackson has gotten better horse-race coverage than any of his competitors.    Equally important, he's getting not just great press but a greater share of it. Before New Hampshire, he got less than half as much TV coverage as either Messrs. Dukakis, Gephardt or Simon. Since then his share of the coverage has nearly tripled, giving him parity with the other major contenders.    No other candidate this year has attained such high marks for visibility, desirability and viability. It's the media equivalent of a triple play -- as difficult, rare and dramatic in politics as in baseball. The glare of TV cameras normally produces as much heat as light, sending front-runners down in flames. Messrs. Hart, Biden, Simon and Gephardt have all seen their campaigns shrivel under the media spotlight. In fact, every other Democratic contender has gotten more bad press than good press from the networks since the Iowa caucuses.    While his opponents have fizzled on TV, Mr. Jackson has sizzled. A week of glowing reviews from Illinois was capped by a CBS election-night report that concluded, &quot;This week, Jackson has been King,&quot; and compared his campaign favorably with Robert Kennedy's 1968 crusade.    Does race have anything to do with this? Of course it does. A white opponent who attacks Mr. Jackson is more likely to alienate his black constituency than to make inroads into it. That leaves Mr. Jackson free to reach out to the liberal yuppies who form the core of his limited white support. (Exit polls show that white Jackson voters are disproportionately young, well-educated, and middle income or better).    Mr. Jackson is the exception because his campaign has been exceptional. By eschewing name-calling confrontations with his opponents, he avoids the debate zingers and attack-ad snippets that get replayed on the evening news, dragging everybody into the mud before a national audience.    So far, his media-borne message is getting across. He has jumped from 13% to 22% in the Democratic Preference Polls since February, with most of this gain coming among whites. The proportion of voters with an unfavorable view of him has declined even more dramatically, from 45% in January to 30% last week.    But history tells us that media honeymoons can't last. TV's previous romances with Jimmy Carter, John Anderson and Gary Hart all soured once they became serious contenders. Media fairness in elections doesn't mean treating the candidates equally. It means equalizing their chances by building up underdogs and slapping down top dogs. So Mr. Jackson should savor the moment. The media have given him a ticket to ride, but they're unlikely to leave him in the driver's seat for long.    ---   Mr. Lichter is co-director of the Center for Media and Public Affairs and a fellow at the American Enterprise Institute. </TEXT></DOC>
