Vice President George Bush lent his supportto President Reagan's veto of a civil rights bill, saying he's``not going to start differing with the president now.''   Democratic contenders Albert Gore Jr. and Paul Simon flew backto Washington to cast their votes for an override. Gore criticizedBush's loyalty to Reagan ``even when the proposals are ... dumb.''   Gephardt was angered by Dukakis' change-of-mind on tradelegislation and he accused the Massachusetts governor of aflip-flop to improve his chances in Saturday's caucuses inMichigan, where 138 delegates are at stake.   ``Now we're getting some battlefield conversions on trade. ...The acid test on trade is the Gephardt amendment,'' the Missouricongressman told senior citizens in Madison Heights, Mich.   Last night, Gephardt told reporters, ``On the central issue inthis campaign, Mike Dukakis is trying to have it both ways.''   Dukakis on Monday endorsed a trade bill put forward by MichiganSen. Donald Riegle, which Gephardt said was very similar to hismeasure. The Massachusetts governor has opposed Gephardt's bill.Riegle endorsed Dukakis Monday as did Michigan congressmen DaleKildee and Bob Traxler.   ``This is no change in my position,'' Dukakis responded at hisown news conference.   Michigan did not have the spotlight to itself as candidates fromboth parties are stumping in Connecticut, with its primary a weekfrom today, and Wisconsin, a week later.   Dukakis was making a foray into neighboring Connecticut today,where he appeared well-positioned to add to his string of wins onhis New England home turf. Campaign sources said Dukakis willreceive a sought-after endorsement on Wednesday from New JerseySen. Bill Bradley, who has been mentioned as a possible dark-horseDemocratic nominee if the convention is deadlocked.   Gore, still searching for a Northern breakthrough afterestablishing his candidacy in the South, met today withPennsylvania Gov. Robert Casey, who said afterward he still hasn'tdecided whether to endorse a candidate before the state's April 26primary. On Monday, the Tennessee senator met with New York Gov.Mario Cuomo, who said some nice things about him but didn't endorsehim.   Although Connecticut is one of Bush's home states _ his fatherrepresented it in the U.S. Senate, and his mother and brother stilllive in the state _ the vice president said he was taking nothingfor granted there.   ``I don't want to be beaten in this state,'' he said as hecampaigned in Bloomfield on Monday. In Connecticut, reporters askedBush whether he backed President Reagan's veto of a sweeping civilrights bill.   ``I'm not going to start differing with the president now,'' hereplied.   Later Bush told black supporters in Washington that he supportsthe idea that institutions receiving federal money should complywith civil rights laws. But he said the civil rights measure,passed overwhelmingly by both the House and the Senate, was flawed.   ``The legislation ... is imperfect and the imperfections shouldbe corrected,'' he said. Up until Monday, Bush had not saiddirectly whether he supported the veto.   ``I'm not going to start doing now what I haven't been doing forseven years, finding differences with the president, for whom Ihave great respect,'' he said.   The measure would forbid the distribution of federal funds toentire institutions, state and local government agencies and manycorporations if any part of them practices discrimination. Theadministration supports a plan that would grant religious schoolsand organizations as well as corporations more exemptions fromcivil rights laws.   Bush said he believed the president should have line-item vetopowers so he could ``take some of the extremes'' out of bills likethe one in question.   Earlier Monday, New Jersey Gov. Thomas Kean endorsed Bush, andNew Jersey's 21 county GOP chairmen followed suit. New Jersey'sprimary is June 7.   Bush's Republican opponent, down-but-not-out Bob Dole, was inWisconsin, where he again challenged the vice president to adebate. But Bush has rebuffed Dole's calls for a faceoff, saying itis time to turn the attention to differences with the Democrats.   Gephardt was campaigning in the must-win state of Michigan,wooing workers at a steel mill and making appearances with ChryslerCorp. chief Lee Iacocca at his side. Iacocca says he likesGephardt's trade stance, but isn't formally supporting him.   Gephardt's says his trade views _ raising the threat ofsanctions if foreign barriers don't come down _ are getting a goodreception in the industrial state of Michigan.   ``The people in Michigan are interested in someone who is reallygoing to stand up on the trade issue,'' he said in Highland Park.   Jesse Jackson made a visit to Colorado, which holds Democraticcaucuses on April 4, and met Monday with ex-candidate Gary Hart.   Jackson said Hart was going to advise his campaign on policymatters. Hart said, however, that he wasn't formally endorsingJackson. That, he said, would be ``old-fashioned.''   Hart abandoned his Democratic bid earlier this month, 10 monthsafter quitting the first time over reports about his relationshipwith a Miami model.   Jackson was campaigning in Michigan today.   Simon's campaign on Monday was talking up his plans for a bigmedia buy in Wisconsin. Simon won his home-state primary inIllinois last week without buying any television ads. He has saidhe hopes for a ``respectable'' showing in Michigan, although hecan't spend much money in the state.</TEXT></DOC>
