(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A federal judge ruled that the CustomsService must release about 1,200 semiautomatic rifles impounded atan airport as part of the Bush administration's ban on theimportation of assault weapons.   The decision was issued Wednesday by U.S. District Judge WilliamAcker Jr., who criticized the temporary ban, initiated by federaldrug policy coordinator William Bennett.   The ban was ``obviously the product of a `hurry-up' skullsession, if not a stampede reaction set off by Bennett,'' the judgesaid.   Acker did not overturn the ban for other rifle models importedto other cities. But he ordered federal officials to deliver to GunSouth Inc. of Trussville about 1,200 Steyr AUG-SA rifles impoundedby customs agents at the Birmingham Municipal Airport and another3,000 to be sent from Austria.   The company argued that the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco andFirearms approved import permits for the rifles before the Bushadministration announced its ban in late March.   The Justice Department was reviewing the decision and had notdecided whether to appeal the judge's ruling, said spokeswoman AmyBrown.   There was no immediate comment from the Customs Service.   ATF Director Stephen Higgins said in court documents thatreleasing the weapons would undermine the government's policyreview of the effects of the temporary ban.   Acker said the administration issued the ban without consultingAmerican gun dealers or foreign manufacturers of semiautomaticrifles, and without re-examining ATF's past approval of the SteyrAUG-SA.   The ban followed a schoolyard shooting in California involvingan assault rifle.   Gun South owner and president Don Wood, who sued four weeks ago,testified his company would face bankruptcy if it could not receiveand sell the rifles it has ordered and committed to pay for.   The company also claimed the Steyr AUG-SA rifle is used forhunting, the criterion on which ATF had approved previous shipmentsof the rifles.   The Justice Department argued that the public interest inhalting importation of semiautomatic and automatic rifles pending areview outweighed any potential harm the temporary ban might causeGun South.   ``This is a small case but a significant example of why ourjustice system enjoys the envy of the world. Once again, a federaljudge has enjoined the government from violating the right of wayat a constitutional intersection,'' said James C. Barton, anattorney for Gun South.</TEXT></DOC>
