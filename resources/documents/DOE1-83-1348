The kinetic measurements are carriedout under conditions where the carbon particle consumption rate is controlledby gas-particle interactions and not by mass transfer. Auxiliary surface-areameasurements on partially oxidized particles collected from the HTFFRindicate that the oxidation is controlled by external-surface ratherthan pore-centered reactions. The measured particle reactivities (g cm{sup-2} s{sup -1}) are x 10 smaller than predicted by the often-used Nagle-Strickland-Constablesemi-empirical model for carbon oxidation nor do the O{sub 2} dependencesconform to this model. Additional work is required to elucidate the reasonsfor this disparity.</TEXT></DOC>
