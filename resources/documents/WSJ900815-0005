Auto company executives, dealers and industry analystssaid they have seen little effect so far from Iraq's invasionof Kuwait, which caused gasoline prices to spike last week.Instead, they said, consumers seem to be pulling in theirhorns because of longer-term economic worries.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;I don't think people are going to stop buying carsbecause of high fuel prices,&quot; said Chrysler Corp. ChairmanLee A. Iacocca. &quot;I think they are going to worry about theirjobs and the uncertainty {over} a recession that this Iraqsituation may bring upon us.&quot;   The results from the Aug. 1-10 period this year stand insharp contrast to year-earlier sales, which were pumped up bybuyers taking advantage of huge rebates in order to avoid bigprice increases on the coming 1990-model cars and trucks.   Makers of domestic vehicles sold 246,772 cars and truckscompared with 302,940 vehicles in early August last year. Asa result, car sales in the first 10 days of this month hit aseasonally adjusted annual sales rate of 6.6 millionvehicles, according to a Commerce Department formula. That isfar below the 8 million car sales-rate from a year earlier.   Auto makers expected to see sales pick up in the secondhalf of this year after struggling through the first part of1990 by dishing out huge incentives but getting only weaksales in return. Now industry officials are expressingpessimism about the rest of this year.   Tom Webb, chief economist for the National AutomobileDealers Association, predicted seasonally adjusted annualsales rates will come in closer to a meager 6 million cars inthe months ahead because of deteriorating consumerconfidence.   &quot;I hope there's not more than another two weeks {of weaksales}, but that's living in hope,&quot; Mr. Iacocca said at aceremony for the start of 1991-model minivan production atChrysler's Windsor, Ontario, assembly plant. &quot;It could lastsix months.&quot;   Chrysler's sales in the period were by far the worst ofthe Big Three U.S. auto makers. Its domestic car sales fell asteep 38.6%, while its domestic trucks were hurt by newvehicles from competitors and slipped 22.5%.   General Motors Corp. reported a sharp sales decline withits domestic cars, off 22.2% as a result of weakerperformances from all five of its car divisions. Sales byGM's Oldsmobile division, which have been deteriorating allyear, fell a steep 41.4% in early August. Cadillac sales,meanwhile, dropped 41.6%.   Even GM's imported car sales, which have been a source ofstrength all year, plunged 39.7%. The No. 1 auto maker hashad trouble getting enough of the hot selling Isuzu-built GeoStorm because of Japanese import-quota limitations.   GM's domestic truck sales also suffered, falling 18.1%.But Ford Motor Co., helped by the popularity of its Explorersport utility vehicle, saw its truck sales fall only 4%. Thenews wasn't so good, though, for Ford's domestic car sales,which dropped 21.3% in the period.   Ford was hurt primarily because sales of the Escortsubcompact plunged 47.9% in early August. Sales of theredesigned 1991 Escort, which came out earlier this year, andthe older version were off 21.8% for the whole year. Sales ofthe Ford Thunderbird coupe dropped 47.9%, while the similarMercury Cougar saw its sales fall 50.3% in early August.   The sales decline didn't leave Japanese auto makersunscathed either. Honda Motor Co.'s domestic car salesplummeted 15.4%, while Nissan Motor Co. car sales fell 33.1%.Toyota Motor Co. showed a 64.3% improvement in domestic carsales.   ---          RETAIL U.S. CAR AND LIGHT TRUCK SALES-a                                                                                                                                      1990        1989       x-%                            Aug 01-10   Aug 01-10     Chg.
