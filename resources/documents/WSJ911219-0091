That's the outlook of economic and employment analysts whosee few industries but health care escaping deep cuts intheir employment levels because of the nation's weak economy.&quot;We see a tremendous number of people injected into the jobmarket in 1992,&quot; especially from large employers, says DanLacey, editor of Workplace Trends newsletter. &quot;It willprobably be a record number in terms of people who used towork for Fortune 500 employers.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   Work force reductions &quot;clearly will extend into 1993,&quot;predicts Scott Aguais, an economist at DRI/McGraw-Hill. Heanticipates business &quot;getting worse before it gets better&quot;and even when the economy starts expanding, &quot;it's not goingto be robust,&quot; he contends.   Many employment company executives also see further jobpurges next year. &quot;We expect a continuation of substantiallayoffs,&quot; says Peter Henderson of Jannotta Bray andamp; Associates,a large Chicago employment firm, who notes: &quot;I don't seescattershot reports of hiring.&quot;   Among industries, cutbacks &quot;are across the board&quot; exceptfor the health-care field, says Mr. Lacey, whoseCleveland-based newsletter has been tracking permanent staffcuts since 1988. He says they have been running at a rate of2,600 a day since October. &quot;Computers, aerospace, banking,food products, consumer products, oil, machine tools, youname it and it's on the list,&quot; Mr. Lacey says.   The paradox here is that, despite the tremendous wave oflayoffs, the unemployment rate isn't soaring. The nationaljobless rate stands at 6.8%, well below the peak of 10.8% inthe economic downturn of the early 1980s. The number ofdiscouraged workers is also much smaller than in the previousrecession.   One reason the jobless rate isn't soaring is that thenumber of new entrants into the work force hasn't grownduring the past year, reflecting a slowdown in the number ofcollege-age students, women and discouraged workers lookingfor jobs. The pool of eligible workers stands at 125.2million, virtually unchanged from 12 months ago.   The overall number of jobs in the U.S. rose about 0.3%between April and October of this year, but most of thosegains were lost in November. At some point during 1992,unless the economy deteriorates further, job growth shouldresume. The Blue Chip Economic Forecast of Sedona, Ariz.,calls for an average jobless rate of 6.5% next year.   What is more difficult to measure is whether the qualityof jobs is deteriorating, even as the quantity remainsconstant. What Mr. Lacey and others believe is thatonce-secure jobs with generous benefits at big companies arebeing eliminated, and are being replaced by jobs in smallercompanies with inferior benefits and little assurance oflong-term employment.   Smaller companies may be overrated as sources of new jobsnext year, though. &quot;Small business provided lots of jobgrowth in the 1980s, but it won't in 1992,&quot; says RichardBelous, senior economist at the National PlanningAssociation, a Washington, D.C., trade group. &quot;With thefinancial system in chaos, it's much harder for small- andmedium-sized businesses to meet the financial requirements&quot;of lenders, he says.   Regionally, the trend of substantially trimming staffsthat began on both coasts, especially in the Northeast, isgradually moving inward, notes Mr. Lacey. That's because thelayoffs trend hit the manufacturing sector, which is anchoredin the Midwest, later than industries such as financialservices. &quot;There's been more cutting in the Midwest thanpeople talk about, and there's a definite move into theoil-producing states,&quot; he says. The Southeast, however,continues to maintain a healthy employment picture.   The dismissal rate, of supervisors and managers as well asproduction workers, should quicken in the first quarter toreflect the deluge of job cuts that have been announced inrecent weeks. Employment analysts point out that it oftentakes months for announced staff reductions to begin to showup in jobless insurance numbers. That's particularly truewith fired white-collar workers, many of whom receivejob-placement help and severance packages that help tide themover for a while.   A TRW Inc. spokesman, for instance, says his company's18-month-long plan to reduce its staff by 2,500, including anestimated 1,000 dismissals, won't begin until January. AndInternational Business Machines Corp.'s announced drive toreduce its giant work force by another 20,000 jobs won'toccur until next year as well.   An upswing next year in permanent job cuts also issuggested in an American Management Association survey, eventhough it was taken in July. That survey of 910 employersindicated that 22% of them, far higher than any previoussurvey, plan to reduce work forces through June 1992.   American Management researcher Eric Greenberg notes thatmany of those cuts will come in next year's first half andthat the number of employers that actually reduce staff isusually two to three times the percentage initially sayingthey will. That suggests two-thirds of the surveyed companiescould cut back on staff by June 30. Mr. Greenberg alsoemphasizes that the economic outlook &quot;has gotten worse&quot; sincelast July's survey.   &quot;When this survey was taken, there was hope in the airthat we were undergoing some kind of recovery. That hope hasdisappeared,&quot; asserts Mr. Greenberg. According to hisresearch, the companies he surveys have eliminated 212,000jobs over the past three years, with about 80,000 of thosejobs representing supervisors, middle managers,professionals, and technical workers.   By business category, the survey suggests that employerscutting staff in the fiscal year ending June 30, 1992, wouldinclude 29.5% of financial services concerns, 27.1% ofwholesale and retail trade concerns, 21.4% of providers ofbusiness and professional services and of manufacturers, and19.6% of companies providing other services.   The deepest cuts were projected for wholesale and retailtrade concerns, which are expected to reduce their averagework forces by nearly 14%. Anticipated cutbacks averaged11.4% for financial-services companies, 9.5% formanufacturers, 4.6% for providers of business andprofessional services and 5.3% for other services concerns.   Not everyone anticipates that next year's hiring picturewill be as bleak as all that. Mitchell Fromstein, presidentof Manpower Inc., thinks many employers will reduce staffs bythe end of the month, figuring &quot;1991 is a throwaway year.&quot;   He also points out that the latest quarterly survey of15,000 companies by his Milwaukee-based temporary-employmentconcern suggests the best overall hiring outlook in 15 monthsin the first quarter. The new survey shows that 15% ofcompanies intend to add workers in the first quarter, thesame percentage planning to reduce their work forces. Thiszero gain compares to a negative 1 percentage-pointprojection in the year-ago quarter and in the first quarterof 1983, which followed the 1982 recession.   When adjusted for seasonal factors, including thepost-Christmas layoffs by retailers, the latest surveyresults suggest a positive 9 percentage-point gap betweenemployers planning to hire in the first quarter and thoseexpecting to pare jobs. &quot;The new figures seem to verify thepresence of an economic recovery but, at the same time,punctuate its slowness,&quot; says Mr. Fromstein.   However, he adds that IBM's announcement several weeks agoof hefty job cuts in 1992 could prompt other employers tofollow its example. &quot;The real trigger is IBM, which has beenan icon for full employment, high wages, and a strongculture,&quot; he maintains.   What hiring occurs next year probably will be at smallerand medium-sized companies, which already are lean and canmore quickly respond to improving business conditions. Asurvey early last month of nearly 200 such companiesindicates that nearly 75% of them expect to increase staffnext year by an average of nearly 16%.   &quot;These entrepreneurs will continue to be the engine thatwill lift the country out of the recesion,&quot; says Dan Garner,national director of entrepreneurial services at Ernst andamp;Young, the accounting firm that conducted the survey.   Platinum Technology Inc., for example, doubled itsemployment this year to 150 as its revenue surged, and the 41/2-year-old Chicago computer-software concern expects toagain double its work force in 1992, says Andrew Filipowski,founder and president. He contends that the heavy job purgesin the computer industry over the past three years reflect&quot;stupid, archaic and dying companies that aren't doing thingscustomers want.&quot;   Voca Corp., a Columbus, Ohio, builder and operator ofcustom group homes for the disabled, anticipates boosting itsemployment next year by about 200 to 2,500 as the 11-year-oldbusiness grows a projected 30%, says Vincent Pettinelli,owner and chief executive officer.</TEXT></DOC>
