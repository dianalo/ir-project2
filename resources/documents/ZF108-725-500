How do we evaluate the cost of errors?&quot;andM;He suggested the social impact of those systems will raise these furtherquestions:andM;*  Will they be considered tools for people or &quot;monitors and controls overus?&quot;andM;*  What problems will arise from replacing people with machines?andM;*  Will these systems be available to everyone? Or will they be restricted tothose who can afford them?andM;*  What will be the developer's sensitivity to errors?andM;*  Will the developers be aware of the social impact? Will they be aware oftheir responsibilities?andM;The panel consisted of three speakers.andM;* Rudy Estrada, Internal Revenue ServiceandM;The IRS opened their AI lab in 1985.andP;  They are investigating using AI systemsin a variety of ways  - both to enforce compliance and to provide service tothe tax payers.andM;Mr.andP;  Estrada reminded us  (unnecessarily) that the IRS has a reputation forgiving erroneous advice when taxpayers call in with questions.andP;  The problem,he said, is that the turnover rate among the  &quot;experts&quot; who answer thequestions is so high there is no &quot;institutional memory.&quot; That is why the IRSis experimenting with AI to answer questions.andP;  &quot;The degree of correctresponses has gone up [by a factor of 10]!&quot;andM;They have another Al system to handle written inquiries.andM;Those systems have to take into account &quot;the disparity of the clientele.&quot;andO;Corporate tax lawyers call with complex questions that require detailedresponses  - backed by references to the specific applicable laws  - chapterand verse.andP;  Naive taxpayers need completely simple answers.andP;  The present AIsystem is two-tiered for those groups.andP;  The intent is to provide amulti-tiered system to accommodate a wide variety of users.andM;Other systems under development include:andM;*  A neural-network system to handle problems with overseas taxpayers.andM;*  An internal IRS system to schedule their many computers  - thus improvingefficiency and avoiding the problem of a few years ago.andM;*  A system to pre-process tax returns, selecting those needing specialaudit.andP;  That work is now done manually by the auditors  - which consumes timethat could be spent auditing.andM;*  A system to determine &quot;reasonable cause&quot; for penalties.andP;  If done by animpartial machine, there will be less resentment and fewer accusations of&quot;special treatment.&quot;andP;  People don't mind paying their taxes if they feel thelaw is fair and being applied to everyone equally.&quot; CAN COMMENT: Interesting!andO;The IRS, with its huge complement of mainframes is a progressive,state-of-the-art user.andP;  Their new Al systems could be beneficial to allconcerned  - George Orwell notwithstanding.andM;* John G. Harper, University College, Dublin, IrelandandM;The system he described sounded extremely interesting.andP;  Unfortunately, for avariety of reasons, he was terribly difficult to understand.andM;His university is developing a &quot;European driving program&quot; to:andM;1.andP;  improve traffic efficiencyandM;2.andP;  improve traffic safetyandM;3.andP;  improve traffic science technologyandM;&quot;Present detection and deterrence is not working well.&quot; (Anyone who hasdriven in any of the major European cities can attest to that!) Europeandrivers, not unlike their American cousins, do not see traffic violations as&quot;criminal acts.&quot; They perceive penalties not as punishment for wrong-doing,but as punishment for being caught.andP;  Another problem is the long lag betweencrime and punishment.andM;This new, automated traffic system, dubbed  &quot;Autopolis&quot; in Dublin, will(theoretically):andM;* aid in the detection of violatorsandM;* shorten time-to-trialandM;* be perceived as impartial (They face the same problem of perception as doesthe IRS.)andM;How does the system work, you ask? (Get this!) A device is implanted in eachcar.andP;  It identifies the vehicle and allows it to be monitored as it is beingdriven.andM;Future plans call for each driver license to be a &quot;smart card&quot; that  willhave to be inserted in the device.andP;  The driver, not the car, will beidentified and monitored.andP;  With that data available, the police would knowthe driver's age, driving experience, and driving record.andM;&quot;We have a lot more thinking to do.andP;  There is a problem of socialacceptability.&quot;andP;  (He's got that part right!)andM;He reported that their survey found the police in favor of the system.andP;  Theybelieve it will help them enforce the law, and it will help the public'sperception of equal treatment under the law.andP;  The same survey found drivers&quot;not too happy&quot; with the system.andP;  CAN COMMENT: Their survey was onlyconducted in Ireland, England, Denmark, and The Netherlands.andP;  Ha! Wait untilthey get to France and Italy!!! This could lead to war!!! There goes 1992 !andO;*  Anatol Gershman, Anderson ConsultingandM;Instead of addressing an AI application, the speaker attempted to discuss tiequestions posed by the chairman in his opening remarks.andP;  Unfortunately, theresult was rambling and disjointed.andP;  It sounded totally unprepared.andP;  Theaudience began to leave early.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
