Nelson and Thomas Kamm (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> EUROP </CO><IN> TNM FIN INS </IN><TEXT>   Carlo De Benedetti and Andre Leysen have agreed to meet tomorrow amid signs that the rival bidders for control of the giant Belgian holding company Societe Generale de Belgique S.A. are considering negotiations to head off a long and bitter legal fight.    Statements over the weekend from both camps indicated that they may be seeking a compromise that would allow them to run the company together. At this stage, however, neither side appears ready to surrender prospective management control of the company.    Mr. Leysen suggested the talks with Mr. De Benedetti at a news conference Friday. Mr. Leysen, chairman of Gevaert N.V., said he had put himself in a much-improved negotiating position in the past week, receiving commitments valued at 30 billion Belgian francs ($861.6 million) from a group of Belgian and other European companies that support his cause. The group expects to control 34.25% of Generale de Belgique's share capital if a Belgian court rules in favor of a controversial share issue that Generale de Belgique made to defend itself from Mr. De Benedetti. A ruling is expected Wednesday.    Mr. Leysen said yesterday in a television interview that he had met with representatives of Mr. De Benedetti's group over the weekend and would meet with the Italian financier tomorrow.    Mr. Leysen claimed a new &quot;position of strength&quot; that he hoped would convince Mr. De Benedetti to negotiate shared control of Generale de Belgique. But he also noted that both sides risk losing the ruling by the Brussels Commercial Court about the legality of Generale de Belgique's issue of 12 million new shares, and emphasized that both groups could avoid the risk of a complete loss by negotiating before the court makes its ruling.    If the share issue is approved, it would dilute Mr. De Benedetti's current 18.6% holding to about 13% and make it virtually impossible for the Italian financier to acquire a controlling stake. If the court rules the issue illegal, Mr. De Benedetti would have a good chance of increasing his stake to about 25%, which he says would be enough to control the company in combination with several friendly Belgian partners.    &quot;If the court rules in our favor, we have won this battle,&quot; Mr. Leysen said. &quot;If it rules against us, I will be the first to call Mr. De Benedetti and congratulate him, because he will have won.&quot;    The Belgian Banking Commission still could delay further the launching of Mr. De Benedetti's bid for more Generale de Belgique shares, but most observers said they expect the bid to be approved tomorrow. That would give him the right to bid for an additional 15% of Generale de Belgique's shares. Mr. De Benedetti has agreed with the Finance Ministry to limit his holding to just under 25% and to sell any additional shares tendered to his group to Belgian partners of his own choosing.    One source close to Mr. De Benedetti said that because of the importance of Generale de Belgique in Belgian public opinion, Mr. De Benedetti's group felt it had &quot;an almost moral obligation&quot; to meet Mr. Leysen and talk over the situation.    Moroever, the source noted that Mr. Leysen had gathered the financial support of some of the most important business leaders in Belgium. &quot;All those that count in Belgium are behind Leysen now,&quot; the source said. &quot;They can't be ignored.&quot;    But Cerus S.A., the French investment firm through which Mr. De Benedetti is trying to take the controlling interest in Generale de Belgique, said in a communique that it wouldn't be willing to stop its legal action or give up hope to play the leading role in the company.    &quot;We are ready to make a certain number of compromises,&quot; said Alain Minc, managing director of Cerus. But whatever happens, he said, &quot;we are here and they'll have to deal with us.&quot;    Separately, Belgian Economics Minister Philippe Maystadt contacted the three principal parties in the takeover battle for a progess report, Belgian television reported late yesterday. The minister was reported to be concerned about the effect that the takeover could have on Belgium's electricity supply, a sector in which Generale de Belgique has a near monopoly. The minister asked to see Mr. Leysen, Mr. De Benedetti and Generale de Belgique President Rene Lamy. </TEXT></DOC>
