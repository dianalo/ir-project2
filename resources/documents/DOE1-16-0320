The mechanistic model for endotherms will ultimatelyprovide an enhanced means for generating and testing ecological hypotheses,such as environmental effects on herbivory rates, growth and reproductionrates, survival probabilities and population dynamics. The responsesof endotherms to environmental contaminants could also be assessed. Wehave linked individual physical and physiological properties directlyto population dynamics models. We have also begun to incorporate stochasticprocesses into the models to deal with uncertainty in environments andanimal physiological properties. 8 refs., 1 fig.</TEXT></DOC>
