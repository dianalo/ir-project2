Subjectiveevaluations of body odor are carried out in an environmental chamberas model tests and in classrooms as field tests. The experiments wascarried out with various combinations of temperature, humidity, occupancydensity and occupants sweating condition. From the results, we may concludethat the CO{sub 2} level is a potential index of body odor and 80% ofvisitors may be satisfied with indoor air quality, if CO{sub 2} levelbe kept less than 0.1% which is adopted as Japanese ventilation standards.</TEXT></DOC>
