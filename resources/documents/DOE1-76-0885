Monte Carlocomputer simulations have been used to compare some of the performanceparameters of a tomograph based on the new detectors to similar parametersof conventional small crystal machines. Three different variants of prototypedetectors have been constructed and many tests performed, including measurementsof transverse spatial resolution, depth-of-interaction resolution, energyresolution, time resolution, and high counting-rate capabilities.</TEXT></DOC>
