The National Conference of Catholic Bishops had asked for suchpermission at its November meeting, responding to a request fromArchbishop Francis T. Hurley of Anchorage.   The bishops, in announcing the approval from Rome, quoted Hurleyas saying, ``The church and canon law are not as rigid as some areprone to think.''   The Catholic Church ``has a history of adjusting toextraordinary situations,'' Hurley was quoted as saying in Friday'sedition of his church newspaper.   The extraordinary situation in Alaska, Hurley had said, was aland area bigger than many nations and served by only a few priests.   Hurley pilots his own airplane in order to travel the greatdistances between Alaskan parishes. In presenting his request lastNovember, he told fellow bishops that bad weather can hold him up,upsetting long-scheduled wedding plans.   Officially, the Vatican Congregation for Divine Worship grantedpermission for Hurley to delegate authority for weddings to nuns orlay people otherwise qualified _ knowing how to perform theceremony, licensed by the state and so forth.   Hurley's newspaper said the ruling in this case applies to fivenuns and one lay woman currently serving as parish administratorsin his archdiocese.   The permission applies only to Alaska for now _ for a trialperiod of five years _ but could be extended to other U.S. diocesesin similar situations pending requests to the Vatican by otherbishops.   Hurley said, ``There is no intention to take the priest ordeacon from the scene. Rather this permission will remove theuncertainty that at times hovers over a planned wedding when fog,rain or snow ... makes the arrival of a priest or deaconquestionable.''</TEXT></DOC>
