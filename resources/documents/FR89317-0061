The proposed exemption revision applies to two systems of records: USDA/OIIG-2,``Intelligence Records, USDA/OIG;'' and USDA/OIG-3, ``Investigative Filesand Subject/Title Index, USDA/OIG.''   The proposed revision reflects a proposed amendment to 7 CFR 1.122 publishedelsewhere in today's issue of the <T4>Federal Register </T4>that would provide a general exemption under5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2) for the two systems of records, and indicates thatthe preexisting exemption under 5 U.S.C. 552a(k) is more specifically under5 U.S.C. 552a(k) (2) and (5).   The proposed routine use revision applies to all OIG systems of records_USDA/OIG-1through USDA/OIG-6_and replaces previous routine use provisions with revisedand additional routine uses. Routine use means, with respect to disclosureof a record, the use of such record for a purpose which is compatible withthe purpose for which it was collected. The additional routine uses arecompatible with the purpose for which the information was collected andare needed to enable the agency to carry out its assigned mission. In addition,this revision recognizes recent developments in information law. Disclosurefor routine use is authorized by the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. 552a(b)(3),as amended.   The revision to the procedures for access to records or for contestingrecords applies to USDA/OIG-2, ``Intelligence Records, USDA/OIG.'' Theseprocedures are added to bring this system of records into conformity withother USDA/OIG systems of records procedures.   </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATE: </T2>This action is effective upon final publication of the additionof 7 CFR 1.122 published in proposed form elsewhere in today's issue ofthe <T4>Federal Register </T4>unless changes are made in response to commentsreceived from the public.

The publication of these routine uses would permitindividuals to determine what records pertaining to them are used or disseminatedby OIG. These routine uses are necessary and lawful, and would permit OIGto disclose records for purposes compatible with the purposes for whichthey were collected.
