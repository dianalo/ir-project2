These energysystems are significantly different from traditional electric-power generationbecause they are (1) more energy efficient: (2) usually smaller and decentralized;(3) not wholly owned by utilities; and (4) more flexible for industrialself-generators. A key factor in stimulating these energy systems hasbeen the implementation of Section 210 of the Public Utility RegulatoryPolicies Act (PURPA) of 1978. The major purpose of Section 210 was toremove institutional barriers to electricity generation by cogeneratorsand small power producers, primarily through requiring utilities to purchasepower from these alternative sources. This research characterizes federaland state implementation of Section 210 and assesses four factors expectedto be important to the overall implementation experience: (1) the technologicalor resource opportunities: (2) the characteristics of the state or regionalelectric power system; (3) the overall capacity of the state commission;and (4) the general political climate. This study concludes that Section210 has been successful. States put Section 210 rules and regulationsin place, despite the complex and controversial nature of the legislation.</TEXT></DOC>
