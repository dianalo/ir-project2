After several political campaigns and four years of New York state and local government, she says she enrolled in Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government to sharpen her skills for her next public sector job.    While completing her master's degree in public policy last June, however, Ms. Beer veered course. She is now an associate in public finance at Donaldson, Lufkin andamp; Jenrette Inc., a major Wall Street securities firm.    As William Mulrow, a senior vice president in the same department and a 1981 Kennedy School graduate, puts it: &quot;The things I liked about government were finance and politics. The only place to get that combination now is on Wall Street.&quot;    In an era when two consecutive presidents were elected on anti-government platforms and federal agencies, excluding Defense, have shrunk by more than 100,000 jobs, schools of public policy -- founded, as the Kennedy School was, &quot;to serve society's need for excellence in government&quot; -- have been forced to re-evaluate their goals.    Wall Street is luring away an increasing number of their graduates -- a full 32% of Ms. Beer's graduating class went into private industry. In response, the Kennedy School and Yale's School of Organization and Management this year will begin offering loan forgiveness programs to encourage students to enter the public sector.    And yet the schools are thriving. After experiencing a drop-off between 1979 and 1983, enrollment is once again climbing, as high as about 22,872 in 1985, according to the National Association of Schools of Public Affairs and Administration (this figure includes programs in public administration as well as public policy).    New programs, on both the undergraduate and graduate levels, are opening up around the country. The University of Chicago in November received a $7 million grant to establish a school of public policy.    Some don't see this trend as a contradiction. &quot;This was a natural, expected evolution,&quot; says Richard Darman, who resigned recently as deputy secretary of the Treasury and is now a managing director of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.    Mr. Darman, who taught at Harvard in the 1970s, says &quot;it was always assumed (in the public policy community) that the market for policy analysts in government wouldn't continue to grow as it did in the late 1960s and early 1970s. It was assumed that business leaders would benefit&quot; from having those with this kind of training around them, as well.    David D. Arnold, program officer in governance and public policy at the Ford Foundation, notes that there are simply more career opportunities available now to public policy graduates than there were 10 or 15 years ago.    He acknowledges that &quot;a lot of people at the schools have expressed concern that their students want to grow up and be investment bankers.&quot; But, he says, there has always been a revolving door between business and government. &quot;What is true is that there is an increased mobility between the public and private sector.&quot;    In a recent poll taken by the Kennedy School of graduates of its master's in public policy program, 77% of those who graduated between 1971 and 1984 said they plan to work in both the public and private sectors over the course of their careers. The school called the &quot;combined&quot; career path &quot;the wave of the future.&quot;    Many see the private sector as the place to start. Money plays a role in that decision -- with salaries in the federal government starting at $22,458 for those with master's degrees and no work experience.    But for Kemp Lewis, a 1984 Kennedy School graduate, there was also what he felt was &quot;a stigma attached to working for the government,&quot; especially at an entry level. Now a management consultant for Arthur Young andamp; Co., in Washington, he said he was afraid that after a few years of &quot;trying to get something done,&quot; he'd get &quot;bogged down by the federal bureaucracy.&quot;    Mr. Lewis adds that he sees himself eventually working for the government as some sort of &quot;deputy undersecretary,&quot; but that the surest way to reach that goal was through the private sector.    While the schools still place greatest emphasis on the public sector, they are subtly shifting focus and redefining &quot;the public interest&quot; to meet the realities of a tight government job market and students' financial constraints.    Kathy Kunst, assistant director for administration at Duke University's Institute for Policy Sciences and Public Affairs, said the school has to some degree been &quot;encouraging&quot; its students to enter the private sector because that's where the jobs are.    Guthrie Birkhead, dean of Syracuse University's Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs, notes that in recent years, businesses have &quot;raided&quot; his school and recruited around 10% of each graduating class.    &quot;But it's not that disturbing,&quot; he says, &quot;because the line between the public and private sectors is blurring. We think you can be serving the public good at the Moody's or the Goldman Sachses too.&quot;    A blurry line doesn't help the schools, which from the beginning have struggled to separate themselves from the more established law schools and business schools.    Born as an outgrowth of the influence of the Kennedy and Johnson administrations' &quot;whiz kids,&quot; and the social upheaval of the 1960s, the new schools differed from older schools of public administration in seeking to apply the tools of the social sciences -- economics in particular -- to the problems of governance. Affiliation with leading universities such as Harvard, Princeton, Duke, University of Texas and University of California (Berkeley) gave the new discipline academic credibility.    By now, the schools have evolved into sprawling centers for research, political debates and government executive training courses. Most offer mid-career programs, as well.    But the schools' hubs remain the twoyear master's programs, which lean toward quantitative analysis -- teaching techniques such as cost-benefit studies, mathematical modeling and statistics.    At the same time, the schools try to emphasize the institutional rivalries and political constraints inherent in public management. School officials argue that though many of the skills being taught are available at other professional schools, at the business and law schools they aren't applied in cases that reflect the interests unique to the public sector.    &quot;The notion that deciding what shelfspace to use for Cocoa Puffs or how to market lemon-scented furniture wax prepares you to negotiate arms control agreements, is ridiculous,&quot; says Calvin Mosley, assistant dean and executive director of the public policy program at the Kennedy School.    But Steve Wegler, a recruiter for the Office of Management and Budget in Washington, who says he gets about 75% of his entry-level budget examiners and policy analysts from public policy schools, says it's not because he isn't interested in hiring lawyers or business school graduates.    &quot;They're generally not interested in us,&quot; he concedes. &quot;It's self-selection. We do best at public policy schools largely because the students that go there are interested in the public sector.    &quot;But I don't know that I'd say that public policy students have something that business school students don't,&quot; he says.    The public policy degree hasn't quite established itself on the more political end of Washington, either, where many view it as a ticket only into the civil service bureaucracy.    &quot;I learn by example,&quot; says David Kahan, who decided after three years as a policy analyst for the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities (a liberal think tank) to enter law school this fall. &quot;I don't think public policy types are going into the 'mover and shaker' jobs. They're not in the policy-forming positions.&quot;    Those on Capitol Hill who hire say they look for people with knowledge of specific programs, familiarity with the political process and certain technical and analytical skills. They say they don't care much about where these traits were acquired.    The public policy degree is still &quot;relatively undefined,&quot; says Steve Pruitt, executive staff director of the House Budget Committee. Partly because of their youth, he explains, the schools &quot;haven't yet established the status of, say, a law school.&quot;    But he also attributes the schools' ambiguous status to &quot;an attitude that pervades Washington&quot; these days. &quot;You can't have an administration that purports to shrink government, to lessen the role of government, and at the same time, have these schools,&quot; he says.    Mr. Birkhead of the Maxwell School points out, however, that the current mood isn't unique in American history. &quot;Public spiritedness comes and goes,&quot; he says. Noting the &quot;substantially higher&quot; number of applications to his school since the drop in the early 1980s, Mr. Birkhead says he thinks the country &quot;is kind of worn out on bureaucrat bashing.&quot;    Professor Richard Neustadt, a former member of the Truman and Kennedy administrations, points to the irony of having helped found a public policy school in 1965 -- &quot;one of those rare upbeat moments&quot; that was yet on the eve of Vietnam and Watergate.    &quot;We get a self-selection of people who want to do good, who somehow want to be public, rather than private,&quot; says Mr. Neustadt, who still teaches at the Kennedy School. &quot;And we're here to keep the public flag aloft, in good times as well as bad.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
