In the six consecutive weeks of increases, assets have grown more than $8 billion. &quot;The autumn surge in assets of money-market funds continued and even accelerated last week,&quot; said Jacob Dreyer, vice president and chief economist at the Investment Company Institute, a Washington trade association. &quot;Total assets reached their highest level since May, while assets of general-purpose funds hit their all-time record for the third week in a row.&quot;    He attributed the recent surge to yield spreads that remain &quot;exceptionally large&quot; compared with those on other short-term instruments. In addition, sagging bond and stock prices lured investors to switch to the funds.    Assets of 224 general-purpose funds rose $828.5 million, to $87.21 billion. Assets of 101 broker-dealer funds rose $1.18 billion, to $116.11 billion. Assets of 128 institutional funds rose $596.7 million, to $71.31 billion. </TEXT></DOC>
