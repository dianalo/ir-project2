John R. Dempsey, 54 years old, resigned those posts and as a director of the oil and gas exploration and production concern. Global Natural's chairman, J.W. McFarlane, will assume the duties of chief executive. The office of president will remain vacant for the time being, a spokeswoman said.    Company officials declined to elaborate on the investigation or on Mr. Dempsey's role, saying only that the inquiry centers on purported misuse of company assets in connection with a construction project on land owned by Global Natural and disputed documentation of related transactions.    Repeated efforts to reach Mr. Dempsey for comment yesterday were unsuccessful.    The land in question, near College Station, Texas, is a parcel that Global Natural is in the process of improving in order to sell. The improvements on the property, which was at one time a coal-mining site, include road construction.    Members of the board's audit committee -- all outside directors -- are conducting the investigation. They were in Houston yesterday to meet with Mr. McFarlane and were &quot;reviewing things and conducting interviews of people who might have been involved,&quot; the committee chairman, John M. O'Mara, said.    The investigation could delay the scheduled May 19 annual meeting, an individual close to the company said, adding that the full board will hold a special meeting tomorrow to discuss the annual meeting date and Mr. Dempsey's resignation. The spokeswoman couldn't confirm that there would be a board meeting tomorrow.    Mr. O'Mara, managing director of Chase Manhattan Capital Markets Corp., New York, said Mr. Dempsey &quot;resigned when we started our investigation.&quot; Asked why Mr. Dempsey resigned, Mr. O'Mara said, &quot;He was the CEO and the buck stops there.&quot; Mr. O'Mara added that the suspected improprieties were brought to the company's attention by outsiders, but he wouldn't elaborate.    The company, which reported a loss of $2.2 million on revenue of $29.4 million for 1987, said that even though it isn't sure yet what happened, both the project and the amount of money involved are small and aren't expected to have a material economic effect on the company.    In composite trading on the American Stock Exchange yesterday, Global Natural shares closed at $6.125, down 12.5 cents.    Mr. Dempsey, who joined Global Natural in 1984, was nearing the end of a three-year contract covering his $275,000-a-year job, and the board had been set to keep him on, the individual close to the company said. Mr. Dempsey owns about 3.1% of the company's 22 million shares outstanding, according to Global Natural's latest proxy statement. </TEXT></DOC>
