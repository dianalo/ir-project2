It seemslikely that an appellate proceedings based on section 47, sub-sec. (7),1. sentence VwGO n.F. will be successful. The article in hand discussesthe parallelism of the problem pairs area development planning/licensingin accordance with air pollution abatement laws, and area developmentplanning/industrial installations licensing. The compromise developedby the Bavarian Higher Administrative Court in its decision of April2, 1987, namely to exclude the licensing requirements of section 7 AtomicEnergy Law and the radiological aspects, is not feasible, and would callfor an all-encompassing conflict solution. The effects of the judicialreview on the construction permits issued for the Wackersdorf reprocessingplant, the aspects of substantive law and the letter of the law, as wellas possibility to cure by subsequent presentation of reasons, or by re-interpretation,are discussed by the author. De jure, the author says, a cessation ofconstruction work would be the only proper solution, and would demonstratepolitical culture.</TEXT></DOC>
