Mary McCarthy has had to make sacrifices to get to be a senior vice president at MGM/UA Communications Co. &quot;What I've sacrificed along the way is my husband,&quot; she says. She's twice divorced. Maintaining a family life, adds Stephen Crosson, takes the same kind of effort as his real-estate appraisal company. But, he says, &quot;rather foolishly I felt I didn't need to pay attention to the domestic side of things.&quot; He, too, is getting a divorce.    Relationships are &quot;difficult&quot; while putting in 12-hour days seven days a week as president of Twentieth Century Fox's film division, says Sherry Lansing. She resigned, she says, in part because &quot;I felt I was missing certain things in life that were as valuable as work.&quot; Stresses are especially hard in a dual-career family; one of the spouses may have to &quot;hang back,&quot; maintains Judy Horton, an executive vice president of Georgia Federal Bank.    Marriage works if you &quot;share decisions and plans,&quot; says Terry Christiansen, president of Tracinda Corp.    PAY FOR PERFORMANCE: Problems persist, but companies plug away.    Allied-Signal Inc. says linking compensation with job accomplishments &quot;works very well.&quot; But it concedes it's sometimes difficult to get the message down to supervisors and workers on the lowest level. Consultant Wyatt Co. says only 28% of the workers it surveyed nationally see any clear tie between their work performances and the pay increases they receive.    General Mills Inc. boasts it has established a &quot;high correlation&quot; between the performance and pay of 600 of its managers. But it shies from any precise formula for establishing who gets what. &quot;That kind of tight linkage can cause strange things to happen,&quot; an official says. Foster Wheeler Corp. believes top managers can be measured against numerical goals; judging middle and lower managers, though, often boils down to a supervisor's subjective assessment, it says.    BLACKS COMPLAIN they're losing ground in executive suites.    Some 43% of the black managers surveyed by Richard Clarke, a minority recruiter, believe they have less opportunity now than five years ago to move up the corporate ladder. Only 15% say their promotion chances have improved; 42% think they're about the same. Half are convinced they'll never be able to make it to the top.    Most blame their quagmire on what the survey report terms the Reagan administration's &quot;retreat&quot; from affirmative action. &quot;It is the opinion and experience of these respondents that, once the corporations and businesses saw that they were no longer required to hire or advance blacks, many ceased to do so,&quot; the study contends.    &quot;In the absence of a big brother, people come out from under a rock to throw mud,&quot; Mr. Clarke charges.    TOP MANAGERS fret they're leading a balky horse. Learning International, a training company, says the executives grumble that the middle managers below them focus too much on fighting fires and resolving operational issues and not enough on the boss's grand plan.    WOMEN HOLD one in five appointive cabinet-level posts in state government, the National Women's Political Caucus says. There were 130 women in the positions last year, up from 124 in 1985 and 70 in 1981.    CONCRETE FACT: The National Concrete Masonry Association says the industry will need 119,000 masons within five years because 4% of the journeymen are leaving the trade each year and few youngsters are signing up as apprentices.    SECTION 457 PLANS are largely ignored. Most states and local governments allow workers to defer part of their pay to save on income taxes, much as employees in private companies can do with 401(k) plans. But, says Buck Consultants, only 16% of the eligible public-sector workers are taking advantage of the offer.    AT AIRLINES, middle age is in for new flight attendants.    Air carriers, which in years past used to retire stewardesses who saw their 32nd birthday, now are looking for men and women in their 40s to help fill cabin crews. &quot;More-mature attendants are better,&quot; says Dave Workman, head of Piedmont Airlines' human-resources division. Housewives with grown children, teachers and nurses &quot;make the transition to flight attendant with ease,&quot; he says. Its current training class has candidates ranging from 25 to 48 years old.    Delta Air Lines says it, too, regularly recruits older attendants, including some over 40. American Airlines says it recently employed a female attendant in her 50s to work an international route. Brisk hiring in recent years and a shrinking pool of younger applicants may be part of the reason for the shift to age, suggests Kit Darby, a vice president of the Future Aviation Professionals of America, a membership organization for people seeking airline careers.    Being a flight attendant is &quot;not quite as glamorous&quot; as it used to be, Mr. Darby declares.    THE CHECKOFF: Personnel directors say doffing a jacket at work is acceptable, but they get hot under the collar if executives work without a tie, recruiter Robert Half International finds. . . . Only one in three management consultants is still in the business after five years, one in 10 sticks it out for 10 years, Consultants News says. </TEXT></DOC>
