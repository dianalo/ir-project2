The Commerce Department, which runs the Malcolm BaldrigeNational Quality Award program, is considering taking entriesfrom universities, hospitals and other nonprofitorganizations.   Congress didn't envision such a need four years ago whenit created the annual quality-improvement prize and its threecategories: manufacturing, service and small business. Butmany nonprofits, too, are now adopting &quot;total qualitymanagement&quot; -- and see the Baldrige competition asinspiration.   The National Leadership Coalition for Health Care Reform,a Washington, D.C., advocacy group, recently wrote CommerceSecretary Robert Mosbacher to request a category for healthcare. Educators want in, too. &quot;The management concepts arethe same,&quot; says Gail M. Stephens, deputy executive directorof the American Association of School Administrators,Arlington, Va. &quot;We're all working with people. We're aservice business.&quot;   More than 20,000 of the 180,000 Baldrige applicationsrequested last year went to nonprofits, many of which areusing the contest criteria to help review and reorganizetheir operations.   But allowing them to compete could strain the prize'sbudget, judging capacity and cachet. &quot;If there are a lot ofawards all named Baldrige, there could increasingly be theappearance that the award doesn't mean a whole lot,&quot; saysCurt Reimann, director of the award program.   Still, Mr. Reimann says, &quot;it's conceivable&quot; thatnonprofits may be able to seek the Baldrige Award as early asnext year. The advisory panel that oversees the award isexpected to decide by this fall whether to seek thecongressional approval necessary to expand the program.                                                                                                          Judges Read Selectively   To Make the First Cut                                                                                                          HUNDREDS of corporate executives are racing to prepare upto 75 pages of data and essays to complete their bids forthis year's Baldrige contest. But a lot of the effort -- notto mention the money going to consultants and writers --won't even affect their chances.   That's because Baldrige judges weed out the bulk ofcompanies based on only a portion of their applications. Lastyear, for instance, examiners eliminated 71 of the 97entrants after evaluating their responses to just 13 of 33queries.   Award officials devised the practice to lighten thejudging burden, but insist they can sense an application'soverall strength with the selective reading. Just how narrowthis year's first reading will be isn't yet clear, butofficials believe they can reliably narrow the aspirant poolusing as few as seven items among the 32 on the 1991 form.   &quot;As you use a subset, you know you're going to somewhatsofter data,&quot; says Mr. Reimann, the award's director. But, headds, &quot;our statisticians tell us it's not that much softer.&quot;   To avoid depending solely on ever-narrower readings,however, officials added more examiners this year to helphandle an expected increase in entries. They'll get somesense of the volume next week (&quot;eligibility determination&quot;forms must be postmarked by tomorrow), but won't pick aweeding-out threshold until after April 3, when applicationsare due.   Even then, however, officials won't reveal which itemsjudges will focus on, lest future applicants concentrate onthem to boost their chances of surviving the first round.   Not all is lost for companies knocked out early. Allentrants eventually receive written evaluations of theirefforts -- based on their entire applications.                                                                                                          Outsiders Get Results   On Quality -- Sometimes                                                                                                          CAN GURUS, consultants and coaches help a company get inshape for a Baldrige bid? Word from the top is: It depends.   Two Baldrige judges, part of the ranking nine-member panelthat picks the winners, suggested earlier this month thatcompanies can benefit when hiring consultants for specificquality-improvement projects, such as reducing defect ratesand increasing employee participation. But, they warn,companies that delegate their entire quality effort riskceding too much control -- and getting caught up inoutsiders' doctrine and jargon.   &quot;Don't buy a chef, but ingredients,&quot; Baldrige judge DonaldM. Berwick said at a meeting run by the Conference Board, aNew York business research group. Citing several of the ninecompanies that have won Baldriges to date, judge W. KentSterett added that the most successful businesses havecultivated a &quot;house brand&quot; of quality management, featuringambitious goals, demonstrable results and &quot;leadership,leadership, leadership.&quot;                                                                                                          Odds and Ends                                                                                                          WHEN consultants Grant Thornton asked 250 executives torank quality-conscious manufacturers, International BusinessMachines, a subsidiary of which won a 1990 Baldrige Award,received the most mentions, 30; Westinghouse Electric, one ofwhose divisions was a 1988 winner, got just a single mention.. . . One-third of companies consider the Baldrige&quot;important&quot; or &quot;very important,&quot; while one-quarter havelimited interest in the prize and another quarter nointerest, according to a survey of 471 corporate controllersby the National Association of Accountants.</TEXT></DOC>
