<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-32-0164 </DOCNO><TEXT>A high intensity electron-impact x-ray source using a one-dimensionalPierce lens has been built for the purpose of calibrating a bent crystalx-ray spectrometer. This source focuses up to 100 mA of 20-keV electronsto a line on a liquid-cooled anode. The line (which can serve as a virtualslit for the spectrometer) measures approximately 800 {mu} x 2 cm. Thesource is portable and therefore adaptable to numerous types of spectrometerapplications. One particular application, the calibration of a high resolution(r = 10/sup 4/) time-resolved crystal spectrometer, is discussed in detail.</TEXT></DOC>
