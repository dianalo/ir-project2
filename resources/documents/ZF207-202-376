(standards).andO;Ticker:    IBM.andO;Topic:     Token Ring NetworksBridges (Connector)Boards-CardsLocal Area NetworksIEEEStandardsOpen Token FoundationGuidelines.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Token-Ring Bridges Require Just the Right BoardsandM;One agency project leader who manages token-ring local area networks hasfound that building bridges between those networks requires that interfacboards be mixed and matched carefully.andM;&quot;If you have a device doing bridging, whether it be a server or a dedicatedbridge, you're likely to need more than two boards in the system in order touse the bridge efficiently,&quot; said Harry E. Rogoff, LAN project manager in theOffice of the Secretary of Health and Buman Services.andM;Rogoff said the token-ring interface boards from IBM Corp. are designed so nomore than two of them can be used in any single device on the network.andP;  Thatlimitation means users may have to rely on compatible token-ring boards fromother vendors.andM;&quot;Exclusive reliance on IBM will paint into a corner probably anybody who'sdoing a really big network,&quot; Rogoff said.andP;  &quot;That's the main thing that'sdriving me to revisit this question of finding another vendor's card that Ican use.&quot;andM;In the HHS Office of the Secretary, the typical server has at least two IBMToken-Ring network connections.andP;  To have a third connection, such as he wouldneed to link that server to a backbone network, Rogoff said he must find athird-party token-ring board compatible with IBM's.andM;Software sometimes behaves differently across different vendors' token-ringcard sets, a problem that Rogoff is relying on a reseller to help the agencysolve, he said.andM;A committee that hashes out the details of the token-ring standard is in themiddle of debate over bridges and related technical issues.andM;The IEEE 802.5 token-ring working group is headed by Robert A. Donnan, ChpelHill, N.C., who said in a telephone interview recently, &quot;What is coming intobeing, in fact, what is under consideration in the committee today, issomething called multisegmented networks, where you hook multiple ringstogether.&quot;andM;The token-ring, as presently defined, he said, does not describe multiple, orsegmented, networks.andM;Two ways of bridging LANs are source routing and spanning tree protocols,with source routing favored by IBM for token-ring topologies, Donnan said.andM;Two Types of BridgingandM;&quot;For a number of reasons, the spanning tree is favored by some, and sourcerouting is favored by others,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;Where we stand in the 802[committee] is an agreement that the base means of hooking multisegmentednetworks together is the spanning tree.&quot;andM;The advantage of the spanning tree approach is that all of the communicationswork is done in the bridge, he said.andM;Ever-larger networks and the growing need for bridges and gateways betweenthem are partly the reason that a group of non-IBM token-ring vendors andusers have banded together and formed a non-profit consortium, the Open TokenFoundation.andM;&quot;Interoperability will be solved by a trial-and-error approach, by peoplerolling up their sleeves and learning from everyone's experience,&quot; saidWilliam D. Livingston, president and chief executive officer of Vance SystemsInc., Chantilly, Va.andP;  His company is one of the founding members of the OpenToken Foundation.andM;Standards are sufficiently complex today that you can have conformance butnot interoperability, or you can have interoperability but not conformance,Livingston said.andP;  To have both conformance and interoperability will requirehard work, he added.andM;&quot;People are just now moving to an understanding of conformance testing,&quot; saidLivingston, whose company builds conformance test equipment that thenon-profit Corporation for Open Systems uses to evaluate LAN products.andM;Vance Systems also recently won a contract worth nearly a half-milliondollars to develop token-ring LAN test equipment for the Naval SurfaceWarfare Center's Shipboard Advanced Fiber-Optic Embedded Network, or SAFEnet,which interconnects computers and intelligent devices on board Navy ships.andM;Compatibility WorriesandM;IBM's rivals in supplying token-ring products based on the IEEE 802.5standard are worried about compatibility.andM;&quot;What we found out in our Dec. 5 [1988] meeting is there are a lot ofcompanies .andP;  .  .  who share some of our concerns about the standard being amoving platform,&quot; said Bill Swift, newly elected treasurer of the Open TokenFoundation and token-ring product manager for 3Com Corp., Santa Clara, Calif.andM;The consortium members hope to promote agreement among manufacturers andstandards groups on basic technical requirements for token-ring products, hesaid.andM;&quot;IBM will choose either to join or not to join,&quot; Swift said in a telephoneinterview recently.andP;  &quot;A choice not to join could be based on a lot ofdifferent things .andP;  .  .  so we need to understand that if they decide notto, that may in no way be a statement that they're not in support of thegoals of the organization.&quot;andM;The consortium, more than anything, will be a discussion group, Swift said.andO;&quot;Probably our biggest goal as a group of industry vendors will be to producea stronger voice in what happens to the [token-ring] standard,&quot; he said.andM;IBM's dominance in setting token-ring standards has weakened the value of theIEEE 802.5 standard for token-ring, Swift said.andM;As IBM has introduced one innovation after another in recent months --16-megabit/sec transmission and early token release capabilities -- othercompanies that want to manufacture compatible token-ring products are findingthey must follow IBM's lead to stay competitive.andM;&quot;Do you advertise your product as being IEEE-compatible, or do we produce aproduct which is IBM-compatible?andP;  We're probably safer being IBM-compatible,&quot;Swift said.andM;The 23 companies represented at the initial Open Token Foundation meetingincluded IBM, 3Com, Ungermann-Bass Inc., Proteon Inc., Novell Inc., TexasInstruments Inc., National Semiconductor Corp. and AST Research Inc.andM;&quot;We'd like to have a stronger voice in controlling and managing thestandard,&quot; 3Com's Swift said, &quot;but ultimately what we all want is to havetoken-ring products we can market, produce and sell based on the merits ofthe products.&quot;andM;As measured by recent shipments to users, token-ring local area networks aremaking gains against Ethernet LANs, a new market study shows.andM;The $2,195 hardbound report by Venture Development Corp., Natick, Mass.,andO;forecasts token-ring LAN sales of $1.7 billion by 1993.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
