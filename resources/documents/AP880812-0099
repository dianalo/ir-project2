KNUTSON</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   President Reagan's spokesman today denouncedHouse-passed legislation to withdraw all U.S. investment fromracially segregated South Africa, while supporter announced acampaign to ensure its passage in the Senate.   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the bill would``destroy America's flexibility'' to seek change through diplomaticpressure. ``Such moves are more likely to stymie progress towardending apartheid rather than to accelerate its end,'' Fitzwatersaid.   The House on Thursday adopted, on a 244-132 vote, the SouthAfrica sanctions bill, which also would impose a near-total tradeembargo. The bill faces threats of a Republican filibuster and aReagan veto.   Supporters hailed the dramatic measure as a last-chanceopportunity to bring strong economic pressure to bear to help endSouth Africa's apartheid system of racial separation by expandingthe less sweeping sanctions adopted in 1986.   But Republicans said the bill represents a ``scorched earth''policy that amounts to declaring economic war against South Africa,a war they said would hurt the blacks it is designed to help bycausing millions to lose their jobs.   ``Apartheid is a morally wrong and politically unacceptablesystem which is the root cause of South Africa's disorder,''Fitzwater said.   ``However, the imposition of sanctions is not the solution,'' hesaid. ``Sanctions would hurt the very people that we seek to help.They would destroy America's flexibility, discard our diplomaticleverage and deepen the crisis.''   Groups supporting the bill told a news conference they stilllack the two-thirds majority needed to override a veto but believethey could get it signed by Democrat Michael Dukakis if he iselected.   Robert Brauer, legal counsel to Rep. Ron Dellums, D-Calif., saidproponents were meeting with key Senate aides today to discussstrategy for the Sept. 8 debate of the sanctions bill in the SenateForeign Relations Committee.   Damu Smith, executive director of the Washington Office onAfrica which has lobbied for an end to apartheid, said hisorganization will intensify a grass-roots campaign against athreatened Senate filibuster.   GOP members called on the House to reverse course and adopt apolicy of ``black empowerment'' to increase the economic andpolitical power of blacks and weaken the foundations of theapartheid system.   But Rep. Howard Wolpe, D-Mich., and other sanctions supporterssaid that course simply will not work.   ``Black economic empowerment in the face of apartheid is animpossibility,'' Wolpe said as the House voted down a trio ofRepublican-sponsored amendments designed to dilute or change thelegislation.   With the House and Senate eager to adjourn for the fallelections, little time remains to push the bill through Congress,especially since both houses likely would be faced with votes tooverride a presidential veto.   In a policy statement, the administration said Reagan's senioradvisers will recommend that he veto the sanctions bill if itemerges from Congress in its present form because it ``underminesthe president's ability to conduct foreign policy.''   It was likely that Senate opponents of the measure would launcha filibuster, since there is no limit on discourse in that chamber.Opponents have refused in the past to agree voluntarily to limitdiscussion on such issues, forcing the chamber to a cloture vote toshut off debate, a vote that requires the support of a two-thirdsmajority.   Many Republican opponents accused the House Democraticleadership of staging a political vote to score points among blackvoters for Democratic presidential candidate Michael Dukakis andfor political activist Jesse Jackson on the eve of the RepublicanNational Convention.   ``Some of us wonder if the real purpose of this bill is to beresponsive to the Jackson-Dukakis foreign policy,'' said Rep.William Broomfield, R-Mich.   ``We are not bringing this bill to embarrass Republicans,'' saidRep. Ronald Dellums, D-Calif., principal sponsor of the measure.``We are here to free black South Africa. This has nothing to dowith presidential politics.''   Dellums said White House officials, citing ongoing peacenegotiations in southern Africa, had asked him repeatedly over thelast several days not to bring up the bill until after Congressreturns from its Labor Day recess.   He said he agreed to do so, but only if Reagan promised inwriting not to veto the bill if it reached his desk.   Dellums said that in the end, the White House declined to makesuch a promise and he decided to go ahead.   In an emotional summary that drew a standing ovation from hiscolleagues, Dellums told the House:   ``I listened to those who said this is going to hurt blacks,it's going to hurt corporations. But human beings will struggle fortheir freedom, in peace if they can, in violence if they must. ...That pales every single argument you have made. We must end themadness of apartheid.''   The disinvestment legislation has its roots in the economicsanctions voted by Congress in 1986 and still in effect. Theybanned all new public and private loans and investments in SouthAfrica and barred certain imports and exports.   The bill contains these major provisions:   _All U.S. investment in South Africa would be banned and U.S.corporations with such investments would be compelled to divestthem. The investment ban would not apply to any business in whichblacks or other non-whites have at least a 90 percent ownershipinterest.   _All South African imports to the United States would be bannedexcept for certain strategic minerals and publications. The 1986sanctions law banned only agricultural products, coal, textiles,uranium, and military vehicles.   _All U.S. exports to South Africa would be prohibited with theexception of agricultural products, publications and U.S. publicand private assistance.   _The bill bars a U.S. company or vessel from transporting crudeor refined oil to South Africa. Americans also would be forbiddento engage in the production of nuclear material in South Africa.</TEXT></DOC>
