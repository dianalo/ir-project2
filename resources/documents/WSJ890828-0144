(FDIC), once exclusively the insurer of banks. The Sandamp;L deposit insurance agency, FSLIC, was scuttled by the thrift bailout bill and its functions turned over to the FDIC. But banks blocked thrift use of the FDIC logo. Congress had to require a new logo for thrifts, one that does not bear the initials FDIC. But that didn't stop the thrifts from saying in ads and commercials that they now are insured by the FDIC, so the banks are upset all over again. Maybe the whole problem could be solved by requiring both banks and thrifts to simply say that all deposits are guaranteed by American taxpayers. Clearly, that is the case. </TEXT></DOC>
