<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-17-1315 </DOCNO><TEXT>A simple and precise method for determination of welded joint yield strengthduring torsion based on step-by-step test of conical specimens is suggested.The moment of deflection of the longitudinal mark at the section thematerial of which began to deform plastically was regarded as the boundarybetween loading stages. An experimental test of cylindrical specimensof carbonic and low alloy steels is conducted. The suggested method basedon step-by-step torsion of conical specimens permits to determine yieldstrength of different zones of a welded joint during torsion for it excludesits contact hardening, as well as to reduce the number of tested specimens.</TEXT></DOC>
