(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   AMAX Inc. said Friday it has repurchased15.2 million shares from Chevron Corp. for $23 each, or about $350million.   A statement from the companies said Chevron has a one-timeoption to request additional payment for the shares over the nexttwo years if AMAX stock rises above $23 a share, with a ceiling of$28 a share.   Chevron, which acquired its interest in AMAX in 1975, was thelargest shareholder in the metals, oil and gas company.   Analysts said the move highlights Chevron's interest in focusingon its basic oil businesses.   Jordan Estra, vice president of S.G. Warbug andamp; Co. in New York,said, ``What it really means is Chevron is focusing its effort backto its basic businesses and its interest in diversification isdiminished.''   Alan Born, president and chief executive officer of AMAX, saidthe company will have to borrow to finance the repurchase, but heexpected the funds to be repaid from the current year's cash flow.   ``AMAX has completed a number of major steps to improve itsprofitability and potential and is experiencing significantimprovement in its operating results,'' Born said. ``This sharepurchase will not dilute the earnings of AMAX's remainingshareholders.   ``We are currently expecting AMAX's net income in 1988 to be inthe order of $4 per share and with this purchase of shares, thoseexpected earnings should increase to about $4.25 per share,'' hesaid.   The repurchase represents Chevron's total holdings in AMAX.   Although corporate headquarters for AMAX are in New York, thecompany's headquarters for its metals businesses are in Greenwich.Chevron is headquartered in San Francisco.</TEXT></DOC>
