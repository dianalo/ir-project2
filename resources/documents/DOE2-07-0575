The theory of TPD-MS is presentedand the method used to determine activation energies of desorption. Theease of oxygen loss from the catalysts heated in vacuo to 650 C increasedwith x. Subsequent adsorption of carbon monoxide leads to a further massloss for x = 0.3 but a gain in mass occurs for x = 0.7 suggesting strongadsorption at oxygen vacancies. Mass increases were recorded for theadsorption and reaction of sulphur dioxide at 500 C that increased withlanthanum content. Exposure to mixtures of sulphur dioxide and carbonmonoxide were accompanied by reaction yielding elemental sulphur, carbonylsulphide and great increases of mass of the catalyst. The X-ray diffractionpatterns of the catalysts after adsorption of carbon monoxide at 500C showed little change from the perovskite structure. However a mixtureof sulphates and sulphides in addition to the underlying perovskite werefound after exposure to sulphur dioxide, and for exposure to both gasesthe original structure was lost and replaced by a mixture of sulphidesand oxosulphides of the metals. No perovskite sulphides were detected.10 figs., 21 refs., 3 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
