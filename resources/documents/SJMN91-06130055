So who cares if Arco or Shell sinks a few oil wells inAntarctica? At least no NIMBYs would complain about derricks spoiling theview.;    But oil exploration and mining would ruin Antarctica. Developmentpotentially would disrupt scientific research there, and put at unacceptablerisk an unparalleled ecosystem.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Editorial  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  ICY, PRISTINE AND OFF-LIMITSRATIFY THE 50-YEAR MORATORIUM ON MINING ANDDRILLING IN ANTARCTICA  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Editorials  </MEMO><TEXT>     At a just-concluded session in Madrid, Spain, 39 nations reached atentative compromise on updating the Antarctica Treaty.;    Washington,dragging its feet all the way, needs steady pressure to accept the compromise.While other nations -- including Japan, Germany and New Zealand -- pushed fora permanent ban on commercial exploitation, U.S. and British delegates heldout for a short moratorium.;    Public pressure at home likely nudged theholdouts to accept a 50-year moratorium on mining and mineral exploration. Thedraft specifies that, when the moratorium expires, it may be lifted only withapproval of two-thirds of the signatories.;    Next month, the originalAntarctica Treaty will celebrate its 30th anniversary. What better way tohonor a model international agreement than to continue its tradition ofpreserving Antarctica for scientific research, and keeping it off-limits tomilitary bases, commercial development and mining.;    Antarctica is aspristine as environments come these days. With a climate harsher than theArctic's, it has less capacity for absorbing intervention and abuse.;    TheEarth endows us with a wealth worth vastly more than the artificial commodityvalue of its resources. It may turn out that preserving Antarctica will reaphumankind more benefits than the yield from digging up and selling off all itsgold, silver and oil.  </TEXT><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910509  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Thursday  </DAY><MONTH>  May  </MONTH><PG.COL>  6B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  281  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Thursday May 9, 199100130055,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
