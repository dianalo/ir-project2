The army responded with tear gas and rubberbullets.   The army said it will close all Palestinian schools in the WestBank for three days starting Tuesday in an effort to limit studentparticipation in the nearly seven-month Arab uprising.   In Jerusalem, police strengthened their forces after a riot inthe walled Old City on Sunday in which 15 Palestinians and severalIsraeli police officers were injured. The protest began over anIsraeli archaeological dig near a site holy to Moslems and Jews.   The disturbances were among the most violent since Dec. 8, whenPalestinians began their uprising against Israel's 21-yearoccupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. At least 215Palestinians and four Israelis have died in the violence.   Israeli officials view Arab schools as major centers of theuprising. So in February, the army closed about 1,200 schools inthe West Bank and Gaza Strip in a move affecting about 475,000students.   Schools in Gaza have been operating on and off since, but 800West Bank schools with 120,000 students stayed closed until thearmy reopened them in a three-stage operation ending June 6.   Brig. Gen Shaike Erez, head of Israel's military administrationin the West Bank, said reopening the schools had not quieted thestudents.   ``Instead of studies, there are disturbances,'' he said, addingthat he hoped the army decision would ``bring home to students andparents that the current level of disturbances is unacceptable.''   Erez said the closing was timed to coincide with a PalestineLiberation Organization call to rename all Arab schools on Tuesday,giving them more Palestinian, nationalistic names.   In Bethlehem, five miles south of Jerusalem, hundreds ofstudents demonstrated on the main road today, hurling stones attroops who responded with tear gas and rubber bullets.   Officials at Beit Jalla Hospital said they treated dozens ofstudents for tear gas inhalation. The army said it was checking thereports.   An Associated Press reporter saw one Bethlehem school that wasrenamed and had a sign ``Intefadeh,'' Arabic for ``uprising'',apparently in compliance with a PLO leaflet.   Police released new figures on unrest within Israel.Commissioner David Krauss said more than 1,000 protests hadoccurred in the last three months, including 730 in the Jerusalemarea.   He said there were 51 firebomb attacks and blamed Arabnationalists for 114 out of 210 cases of arson in forests andpastures. He also said 900 Arabs had been arrested on a variety ofcharges.   Krauss said 55 of the detainees were suspected of arson andinvestigations of more than 20 suspected arsonists would be soon becompleted.   He said police found it difficult to operate in the occupiedterritories after the PLO called for the resignation of Arabofficers, noting that only 300 policemen now remain in the occupiedlands out of the previous 850-strong force.   Sunday's clash began when workers for the Ministry of ReligiousAffairs started digging a hole on the Biblical Via Dolorosa, 30yards from a gate leading to the Temple Mount.   The Temple Mount, or Haram al Sharif in Arabic, houses the Domeof the Rock and Al Aqsa mosques and is the third holiest site inIslam.   Government archaeologist Dan Bahat said the dig was intended toopen a stairway giving access to an ancient tunnel runningalongside the Wailing Wall, Judaism's holiest site. The tunnel ison the outside of the Temple Mount.   Moslem religious leaders, using mosque loudspeakers, called onArabs to rush to the defense of the holy site and said they fearedthe Israelis would dig a passage into the mosque area.   Dozens of youths, some of them masked, darted out of the narrow,twisting alleyways to throw rocks at police.   The police rushed in reinforcements, closed off most of thegates leading into the old city and blocked off some of the mainstreets to keep more Arabs from joining the fray.   They waged a two-hour running battle with the protesters, firingtear gas and rubber bullets to disperse them. Police said sevenArabs were arrested.   An Arab girl about 6 years old was seen with her flower-printdress covered with blood. Witnesses said she was hit by a rubberbullet.   The violence spread to other parts of Jerusalem. In oneincident, three passengers were injured when the bus they wereriding was hit by stones as it drove past an Arab neighborhood.</TEXT></DOC>
