Barney Frank (D., Mass.) could face a House ethics inquiry after admitting that he paid for sex with a prostitute and then hired the man as a personal aide.    Some of Mr. Frank's House Democratic colleagues could ask the House Ethics Committee to begin the investigation to prevent Republicans from taking the initiative, according to House Democratic aides.    House rules call on members to &quot;act at all times in a manner which shall reflect creditably on the House.&quot;    Mr. Frank, who is homosexual, said he had hoped to lead Steve Gobie, 32 years old, away from prostitution to a better life. Mr. Frank, 49, said he fired the man 18 months later when he suspected that Mr. Gobie was using Mr. Frank's Capitol Hill apartment for prostitution.    In a news conference in Boston, Mr. Frank acknowledged that he wrote letters to Mr. Gobie's probation board on his behalf, hired a lawyer for him and paid for court-ordered psychological counseling. Mr. Gobie has been convicted of a variety of drug and sex-related charges. </TEXT></DOC>
