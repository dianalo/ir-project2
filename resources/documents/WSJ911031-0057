In addition to Armscor, these officials said, the U.S.attorney's office in Philadelphia intends to seek a pair ofindictments naming a host of individuals and smallercompanies in a case involving illegal export of missileparts, gyroscopes and other military hardware for SouthAfrica.</LP><TEXT>   Prosecutors have targeted James Guerin, the disgracedfounder of a former Pennsylvania-based global defenseconglomerate, and a number of his associates. Investigators,according to one official, also intend to seek chargesagainst a South African businessman who served as animportant link between the military and Armscor during the1980s.   A lawyer for Mr. Guerin declined to comment and said hisclient also wouldn't comment.   The climax of the three-year probe by the JusticeDepartment, Customs Service and Pentagon criminalinvestigators, according to persons involved in the case, isexpected to be the filing of export-violation charges againstArmscor. Only a last-minute change of heart by prosecutors orthe grand jury could change those plans, according to oneofficial involved.   Believed to be among the most sweeping internationalarms-smuggling and financial fraud inquiries in recent years,investigators in the U.S. and elsewhere are still trying tounravel what they contend is a passel of front companies, 39bank accounts and fraudulent profit reports used to createmore than $1 billion in fake defense contracts. The allegedscheme masterminded by Mr. Guerin almost destroyed FerrantiInternational PLC, one of Britain's most respected defensefirms in the late 1980s.   Law enforcement officials also said that they havetargeted more than 20 companies and individuals as potentialdefendants in the case, including R. Clyde Ivy, one of Mr.Guerin's former confidantes. Mr. Ivy, according to personsfamiliar with the investigation, at one point served on Mr.Guerin's payroll while working for a missile-makingsubsidiary of Armscor.   In a telephone interview from his Lancaster, Pa., home,Mr. Ivy denied that he engaged in illegal conduct. He saidU.S. authorities were aware of dealings between South Africaand Mr. Guerin's main company. He said that during the 1980s,he was regularly debriefed by the Central Intelligence Agencyon matters related to South Africa's military.   In addition, Mr. Ivy said that it was his understandingthat shipments of sensitive equipment were made by aGuerin-connected company, Gamma Systems, to South Africa. Mr.Ivy said that Mr. Guerin always told him that these shipmentshad &quot;Washington approval.&quot; Mr. Ivy added that he thoughtGamma &quot;was a CIA front company.&quot; The CIA declined to comment.   Paul Jacobs, a spokesman for the South African embassy,said he was unaware that any charges were being prepared.   One aspect of the broad-ranging investigation involvedcertain South African weapons Iraq acquired and then usedduring the Persian Gulf war. Prosecutors have been delvinginto whether any of Mr. Guerin's companies were connectedwith those specific weapons, according to people familiarwith the case.   The investigation has generated a lot of attention notonly because of South Africa's role in the case but alsobecause U.S. investigators previously said in court that Mr.Guerin &quot;directed&quot; the fraud. Mr. Guerin -- a charismaticengineer who turned a backyard business into a defense giantand then sold it to Ferranti -- was profiled in a front pageWall Street Journal story in January 1990.   His lawyers have said that Mr. Guerin has signed a pleaagreement with prosecutors in this case and has beencooperating with the government. The agreement remainssealed, but in the past lawyers familiar with the accord saidthat it deals with charges that Mr. Guerin's firms illegallyshipped certain electronics equipment to South Africa.   In the 1970s, Mr. Guerin was part of a top-secret U.S.plan to have South Africa share certain intelligenceinformation with Washington. Investigators and formerassociates contend that Mr. Guerin kept up his connectionswith Pretoria and later used his intelligence ties to helpcover alleged smuggling and financial fraud. Investigatorshave said that Mr. Guerin's network of shell companies wasused to shuttle money around the world and smuggle militaryequipment to South Africa.   As Mr. Guerin's principal South African operative, forexample, Mr. Ivy's office in 1983 helped arrange a visit toSarasota, Fla., by two South Africans who were on a secretmission to buy missile-guidance parts for Armscor, accordingto a senior law-enforcement official.</TEXT></DOC>
