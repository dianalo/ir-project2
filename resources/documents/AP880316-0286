On the New York Mercantile Exchange, contracts for Aprildelivery of West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark U.S. crude, rose9 cents to settle at $15.68 per barrel Tuesday.   The contract fell 70 cents Monday in response to reports thatSaudi Arabia, the largest producer in the Organization of PetroleumExporting Countries, had rejected calls for new restrictions oncrude production.   WTI rose above $16 late last week after OPEC members called fora meeting of the cartel's pricing committee to stabilize marketprices. Officials of non-OPEC producers also met to discuss similarconcerns.   Analysts said they didn't know what to make of Tuesday'srebound. Prices began lower but moved higher later in the session.   ``I think that what you're seeing here is a reassessment of themarket,'' said Peter Beutel, assistant director of Elders FuturesInc. ``I'm not saying that means it's a positive reassessment.There's a lot of uncertainty right now in the market.''
