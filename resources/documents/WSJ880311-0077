The parent company's preferred stock rating was raised to single-B-plus from single-B. About $650 million of securities are affected. Standard andamp; Poor's said the steel industry is benefiting from the weakening of the dollar, reductions in production capacity and improved demand. Those developments and Inland's recent restructuring and modernization efforts have improved the company's profit potential, the ratings concern said.    ---   GENERAL HOMES Corp. -- Standard andamp; Poor's Corp. said it lowered the rating on about $140 million of this Houston-based homebuilder's subordinated debt to triple-C-minus from triple-C. The ratings agency said General Homes' &quot;near-term financial flexibility is extremely constrained due to imminent refinancing risks and tenuous liquidity.&quot; Sandamp;P said the company's financial difficulties reduce its chances of renewing a revolving credit line that is set to expire April 15. Any portion of the approximate $200 million outstanding balance, if not renewed, will be payable over two years starting in June, Sandamp;P said, adding that available sources of liquidity are estimated to be insufficient to meet payment schedules. Sandamp;P also pointed to soft real estate conditions in General Homes' geographic area. A General Homes spokesman said: &quot;We are currently engaged in discussions with the banks in our line of credit for the purpose of revising our credit arrangement so it will be more appropriate for existing market conditions.&quot; The company added that it expects to work out a new arrangement, but declined to give details. </TEXT></DOC>
