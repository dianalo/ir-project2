Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell, D-Maine, and Sen. MaxBaucus, D-Mont., predicted their agreement would win support forclean air legislation. The compromise is not included in PresidentBush's clean air plan which is undergoing consideration by a Housesubcommittee.   Both the administration and Baucus-Mitchell plans are designed toreduce the major component of acid rain, sulfur dioxide, by 10million tons _ and prevent any growth of emissions after thereductions are achieved.   The Bush bill would require the reduction by the end of the year2000 and the Mitchell-Baucus requires the improvement by Jan. 1,2000.   The agreement would exempt states from making further sulfurdioxide reductions through the start of 2000, if more than one halfof their coal-fired power plants utilize pollution-reducingequipment called scrubbers.   According to a list handed out by the senators, the provisionwould benefit Baucus' state of Montana, Kansas, Minnesota, NorthDakota, New Mexico, Utah and Wyoming.   Current law requires all new coal-fired power plants to usescrubbers, including states that burn clean, low sulfur coal minedin the West.   ``This ... requirement has imposed a huge, and environmentallyunjustified, burden on the West,'' Baucus said. Mitchell said``millions of dollars'' have been spent on the scrubbers.   Acid rain is formed in the atmosphere from sulfur dioxide andnitrogen oxide, and is carried hundreds of miles before raining downto earth. Acid rain destroys aquatic life in lakes and streams,damages trees in forests and can damage human lungs.</TEXT></DOC>
