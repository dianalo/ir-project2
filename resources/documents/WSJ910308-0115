Afoul haze blankets both rims and seeps down, lingering overthe rugged floor. Splendid hues vanish.   In a similar way, the Appalachian vistas of ShenandoahNational Park are spoiled much of the year. During&quot;stagnation episodes,&quot; visitors can't see streams and valleysa mere mile or two away.</LP><TEXT>   Now, the parks are about to become focal points in afierce battle that pits natural beauty against economicgrowth. The fight marks the first attempt to use federalair-pollution laws to protect scenic vistas from thecountry's industrial hubs.   Much of the Grand Canyon's haze floats in from NavajoGenerating Station, a coal-fired power plant 80 miles to thenortheast that spews a plume of sulfur dioxide gas at ratesof up to 13 tons an hour. Shenandoah, 60 miles west ofWashington, D.C., has sustained the worst cumulative airpollution of any national park. Already the victim of Midwestsmokestacks, it faces the prospect of 19 new power plants inVirginia.   Later this month, public hearings about these problems arescheduled in Phoenix, Ariz., and Richmond, Va., respectively.Environmental groups want to use the two parks as legal andpolitical leverage to make utilities adhere sooner and morefully to regulations of the Clean Air Act.   Experts on both sides agree that the outcome could havebroad impact. About 70 other national parks and wildernessareas have scenic views that are shrouded, at leastintermittently, by industrial pollution. &quot;People assume thatour national parks are pristine, remote enclaves,&quot; says MollyN. Ross, assistant chief of air quality for the National ParkService. &quot;But these places are no longer immune. Pollutiontravels a long way.&quot;   And in many directions. For example, as winds shift,plumes from the Navajo plant also plague Zion, Bryce Canyon,Capitol Reef, Canyonlands and Arches national parks inneighboring Utah, as well as Mesa Verde in Colorado andMonument Valley and the Petrified Forest in Arizona.Shenandoah and its sister to the southwest, Great SmokyMountains National Park, often get heavy haze plumes fromAlabama steel mills and Texas refineries.   In the atmosphere, sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide gasesundergo chemical transformations. The resulting sulfate andnitrate particles create a whitish haze that scatterssunlight, often cutting visibility by hundreds of miles.   Scientific studies show that the same particles alsocontaminate streams and watersheds and damage plants andtrees. In 12 national parks, for example, biologists havedocumented substantial injury to white pines. In at leastfive parks, they have found long-term damage to yellowpoplar, white ash, black cherry, dogwood and redbud trees.And marble and bronze monuments and statues at such sites asGettysburg National Military Park are discoloring, crackingand decaying at accelerated rates because of acid rain causedby air pollution.   Amendments to the Clean Air Act require &quot;the greatestdegree&quot; of air-quality protection for national parksestablished by Aug. 7, 1977, that exceed 6,000 acres.Specifically, the amendments call for preventing andremedying impaired visibility caused by humans in these 48parks.   Furthermore, the law imposes special requirements toensure that any new or modified sources of air pollutionwon't &quot;adversely affect&quot; the natural, scenic and historicvalues of these parks. It also charges Interior Departmentofficials who manage the parks with &quot;affirmativeresponsibility&quot; to protect air quality and to work with localpermitting authorities.   Utility companies in Virginia want to build morecoal-fired and oil-burning plants to meet burgeoningelectricity demand. At Virginia Power, a unit of DominionResources Inc., energy demand has increased 5.3% annuallysince 1984, about twice the pace of the state's populationgrowth. And the company expects demand to jump 30% in thisdecade.   Even using the latest pollution-control equipment, theproposed plants would still emit about 37,000 tons of sulfurdioxide and 70,000 tons of nitrogen oxides annually. ButVirginia Power and the other companies insist the new plantswouldn't make Shenandoah's environment any worse. Indeed,they argue that denying the permits would mean greaterpollution, because existing plants with inferior technologywould have to raise output to meet demand.   State and federal officials say the Virginia Air PollutionControl Board is likely to grant all 19 applications. But theNational Park Service and the U.S. Forest Service arechallenging the new plants.   So far, the Environmental Protection Agency has sided withthe Virginia utilities. The Interior Department is trying topersuade the EPA to change its mind before next week'shearing in Richmond.   In Shenandoah, poor visibility is visitors' most frequentcomplaint. National Weather Service recordings indicate thatvisibility along the mountain ridges has declined about 50%since 1948. Last summer, Shenandoah officials started ahealth advisory system to alert visitors when ozoneconcentrations approached or exceeded national healthstandards.   &quot;When they come to the national parks, many peopleexercise beyond what they normally do at home because theybelieve the air is clean,&quot; says the National Park Service'sMs. Ross. &quot;But ozone can increase respiratory illness and cancause it even in healthy individuals.&quot;   In Arizona, owners of Navajo Generating Station promisedin 1971 to install a sulfur-dioxide removal system bymid-1975. They haven't done it, and the EPA dragged its feetfor so long on enforcement that the agency is under courtorder to impose corrective steps this year.   What's more, the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation owns a 24%interest in the plant, so that the federal government itselfis party to the Clean Air Act violations.   Now the Navajo plant's owners are trying to resistretrofitting their smokestacks with modern scrubbers. TheSalt River Project, which operates the plant and owns 22% ofit, charges that the pollution-assessment studies wereflawed. It also complains that installing the scrubbers wouldcost more than $2 billion.   But Interior Department estimates show that by amortizingthe expense over many years and collecting acid-rainpollution credits, the cost would fall to about $65 million ayear. For the average Arizona or Nevada residential customer,that amounts to an extra $1.60 or so a month.   The Bush White House, through its Office of Management andBudget, has pressured the EPA to seek a lower threshhold ofcompliance. The EPA backed off its original target of a 90%reduction in emissions.   &quot;It's true we are proposing only 70%, but we aren'tclosing the door on 90%,&quot; says an EPA spokesman. &quot;We arestill requesting public comment on 90%.&quot;   The bigger cut would yield far greater visibilitybenefits. According to federal estimates, the visual range atthe Grand Canyon on the worst days would be 380 kilometerswith 90% pollution controls, up from 283 kilometers with 70%controls.   ---          Pollution Levels in Some National Parks                                                                                                        Concentration in micrograms per cubic meter                                                                                                        PARK                            SULFATES*    OZONE**                                                                                                        Grand Canyon (rim)                  1.4        NA Shenandoah                         11.1       291 Acadia                              4.9       345 Yosemite                            1.7       245 Mesa Verde                          1.4        NA Crater Lake                         0.8        NA Great Smoky Mountains              10.4       228 Mount Rainier                       2.8        97                                                                                                        U.S. Health Standard                0.2***    235#                                                                                                          *1989 summer average concentration   **1988 highest hourly concentration   ***Natural background level established for Eastern U.S.   #National ambient air quality standard                                                                                                          Source: National Park Service</TEXT></DOC>
