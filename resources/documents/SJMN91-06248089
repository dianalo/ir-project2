Nevertheless, several economists say they don't expect things todecline much more because of attractive interest rates and what looks to besome faint signs of life in the local economy. San Jose board members accountfor about two-thirds of the county's residential transactions.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Business  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  HOME SALES HIT 7-MONTH LOWECONOMISTS DOUBT SKID WILL LINGER  </HEADLINE><TEXT>     &quot;I think the Silicon Valley housing market, like its economy, is going toskid along the bottom longer than the rest of the region,&quot; said RandallPozdena, the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco's vice president forbanking and finance. &quot;There is so much rhetoric on either side, but if I wasan outsider looking in and had job security I would see now as a relativelygood opportunity to buy.&quot;;   Others predict the slump to last through earlynext year, though they say it is too early to tell just how strong an economicand housing market recovery to expect.;   &quot;It's an uncomfortable calm,&quot; saidWells Fargo senior economist Joseph Wahed, who added that sales could dipanother couple hundred per month before rebounding early next year.;   Themedian price reported by the San Jose board in August for all types of homesstood at $223,000, down $2,000, or about 1 percent, from July and virtuallylevel with a year ago. The median is the point at which half the homes soldfor more and half sold for less.;   The 1,047 home sales recorded by theboard, however, were down 9 percent from July and nearly 13.5 percent fromAugust 1990.;   Economists and brokers say the sluggish summer market is inpart a reaction to two explosive months of sales last spring. Such quickrelease of pent-up demand -- 1,000 more homes sold in March than in August --combined with poor local economic news and consumer confidence, put the marketback in the doldrums. Not even interest rates at a five-year low generatedmuch buyer interest in August, surprising many in the industry.;   Not onlydid August produce the smallest number of sales by board members for anyAugust since 1984, but at the same time the total number of homes listed bymembers for sale also grew to 11,826 -- 108 off the record set July 1990.;  Pending sales as reported by the Peninsula Regional Data Service, coveringmuch of the valley's west side from Los Gatos to Woodside, were down 6 percentfrom July, though up one-third over August 1990. No median price wasavailable, but officials noted a bigger percentage of sales among homes pricedunder $300,000. One Sunnyvale brokerage hasn't closed a single transactionabove $280,000 in two months.;   &quot;The market is mixed with no clear-cutdirection,&quot; said Palo Alto Real Estate Board president Robert Stelzer. &quot;If ahouse is perceived to be a good value, then it's selling. If it's not, it'snot.&quot;;   What has many real estate professionals and sellers puzzled is whatconstitutes a good value for today's buyers.;   &quot;I think people are justnervous with the economy. But I don't know what more do (buyers) want,&quot; saidSan Jose Real Estate Board President Kathy Davis. &quot;They have all the inventorythey could ask for and the best interest rates in years.&quot;;   Real estateprofessionals report that homes priced considerably below similar homes aren'teven drawing traffic, let alone offers.;   &quot;From a psychological point ofview, there is no middle ground. People move in extremes, either everything isdown the drain or everyone jumps on the bandwagon,&quot; said John V. Pinto, aformer San Jose board president.;   So to close deals, some sellers areresorting to accepting fine art as down payments or lending the buyer 15percent -- or even more -- for a down payment. Most, however, are sittingtight, hoping for a turnaround soon.;   As for prospective buyers, few arebuying the real estate industry's pitch of &quot;buy now or you'll be priced out ofBay Area real estate forever.&quot; Many say they are waiting too, hoping forprices to drop further.;   &quot;Everyone is saying rates are at a five-year low.So what?&quot; said San Jose real estate appraiser Brian O'Neill, who has beencutting appraisal values by an average of about half a percent per month overthe summer months. &quot;Prices are twice what they were five years ago. Thetrade-off doesn't work out.&quot;;   San Jose financial planner Calvin R. Swinsonsaid tighter lending standards are making it tougher for some people toqualify for a mortgage, particularly if it's their first.;   &quot;You can't have asingle black mark against you,&quot; Swinson said. &quot;There's also a lot of concernif you have two people working to make a payment and one loses his or her job,they'll lose the house. Most people in this valley are overextended.&quot;;  Still, some are moving ahead when they see a good deal. Chris Molinari, ofHelp-U-Sell in Campbell, just closed a sale in which the seller of a $258,000Campbell home is lending her clients nearly $40,000 for a down payment andpaying closing costs. &quot;We looked at 48 homes and found two willing to loan 15percent (for) the down payment,&quot; Molinari said. &quot;The other sold, and we madean offer on this one.&quot;  </TEXT><BYLINE>  MARY ANNE OSTROM, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910904  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Wednesday  </DAY><MONTH>  September  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1C  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  CHART  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  952  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Wednesday, September 4, 199100248089,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
