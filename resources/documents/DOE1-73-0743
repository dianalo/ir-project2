To improve on this, convectionsuppression devices are in use. Based on natural convection studies ithas been found that slit structures with an aspect ratio of 0.1 or lesscan give the required suppression. However due to a conduction-radiationinteraction the radiative losses may increase when selective absorbersare used. Leaving a small (3 mm) gap between the absorber and the slitstructure improves on this. Measurements on the heat loss coefficientand the solar transmittance of slit structures have been made. Usingthe results an optimal structure has been applied on a flat plate collector.Significantly higher efficiencies have been found. For {Delta}T/G valuesup to 0.12 such a collector can give an efficiency better than or equalto the efficiency obtained in tubular vacuum collectors.</TEXT></DOC>
