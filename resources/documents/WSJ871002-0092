Scientists said the findings confirm theoretical expectations for the new materials and represent a significant step toward their application in electronics. &quot;This is very relieving because it hadn't been known earlier how well these materials would do when subjected to ultra-high frequency electrical pulses,&quot; said Alex Malozemoff, who coordinates new superconductor research at International Business Machines Corp.    But many fabrication problems -- which may take years to solve -- still must be overcome to build faster computers and other electronic devices with the superconductors.    The recent research involved measurements made with tiny slivers of the new superconductors, materials that conduct electricity without resistance. A group at the University of Rochester said it was able to conduct pulses of electricity as short as 10 to 15 trillionths of a second without distortion through a sample about one-fifth of an inch long. The sample was prepared by another group at Cornell University.    The experiment indicates that the materials eventually will be able to transmit data about 100 times faster than optical fibers, the fastest existing technology for shuttling data to and fro, according to Gerard Mourou, a researcher at the University of Rochester. At that speed, he said, one thousand Encyclopaedia Britannicas could be transmitted in a second.    IBM's Mr. Malozemoff said his company's researchers had made similar findings with somewhat different techniques. He added that using a hybrid device combining superconducting material with aluminum, &quot;We have pushed electronic pulses to about two picoseconds,&quot; or trillionths of a second.    The research involved new ceramic superconductors that work at temperatures that, although low, are more easily and cheaply attained than those necessary for earlier superconductors. The first of the new materials were discovered last year and inspired hopes for a technology revolution that would include everything from magnetically levitated trains to desktop supercomputers.    Scientists said that research with traditional metallic superconductors has indicated that the new materials would be able to handle ultra-high frequency electrical pulses. But until the recent experiments were completed, uncertainties about such predictions had remained.    &quot;We're not out of the woods yet, but we now have a reasonable first step&quot; toward using the new superconductors in faster electronic devices, said Richard Withers, a researcher investigating the new materials at Lincoln Laboratory, a federally funded research center in Lexington, Mass. He added that research at the center also indicates the new superconductors can transmit electrical pulses faster than conventional technology can.    Researchers said the new materials' recently demonstrated capacity to transmit data at high speeds makes them good candidates for connecting fast new computer chips that are being developed with gallium arsenide. Computer chips typically are connected through channels made of copper, gold and other metals. But such materials may not be able to handle data fast enough to keep up with the expected speeds of the new chips.    &quot;Anybody who wants to develop a computer system that is faster by a factor of five or more will have to use superconductor transmission lines,&quot; said Sadeg Faris, president of Hypres Inc., an Elmsford, N.Y.-based concern that makes electronic devices with traditional superconductors. </TEXT></DOC>
