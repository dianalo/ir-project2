But producer-director Michel M. Grilikhes (``Disney on Parade'')has attempted to do so with a live road show of ``The Wizard ofOz,'' which opened Wednesday night at Radio City Music Hall and willvisit 70 cities after it leaves New York April 9.   The $7.5 million production features flying monkeys and sparklinghuman snowflakes, a fire-throwing evil witch, a computerized YellowBrick Road and a house that chugs along an overhead dolly. But withall the stage gimmicks and pyrotechnics, it's a long, slow trip toEmerald City.   Grilikhes, who spent 12 years trying to adapt the 1939 filmclassic version of the L. Frank Baum stories, closely follows thefilm script and includes all the Harold Arlen and E.Y. Harburg songsfrom the original. But the staging is stiff, the pacing slow and thedirection falters.   Still, it is a delightful event for families, and in thosecommunities without repertory companies or little theaters, theproduction is a wonderful way to introduce children to liveperformances. However those under 3 might grow restless by the timeDorothy, the Scarecrow, the Tin Woodsman and the Cowardly Lion reachthe Witch's castle.   The story opens in Kansas, of course, with a set as flat as theplains. Fourteen-year-old Dorothy lives on a farm with her Auntie Emand Uncle Henry and three lovable farm hands. Her little dog, Toto,takes a nip out of mean spinster, Miss Gulch, who takes the poochoff to be dispatched to that great dog pound in the sky.   Toto escapes, finds Dorothy and they run away from home. Shemeets Prof. Marvel who persuades her to return home. She does, justas a tornado is twisting through the landscape.   The house is lifted by wires to a figure-eight dolly on the domeof the Music Hall, where it totters slowly over part of theorchestra like a car on a ferris wheel. The effect doesn't work.There is no brutal force _ even the sound effects and lighting arelimp.   The house crashes on the Wicked Witch of the East, Dorothy meetsGlinda the good witch, gets the bad witch's ruby slippers and headsoff to Emerald City to see the Wizard so she can be sent home.   As Dorothy, the diminutive 23-year-old Grace Grieg is appealing,but her singing voice is thin as she attempts ``Somewhere Over theRainbow,'' and the supposedly tiny Munchkins tower above her. Shewas spotted by Grilikhes while appearing as Snow White in a LasVegas production of ``Beach Blanket Babylon.'' Joe McDonough is noRay Bolger but does a splendid job as the Scarecrow. Joe Giuffre'sTin Man is less inspirational but adequate. Guy Allen is lovable asthe Lion. Polly Feale rivals Margaret Hamilton as Miss Gulch and theWicked Witch. In many respects, she's even more sinister. BartWilliams is the Wizard, Prof. Marvel and the guard at Emerald City.   Toto _ actually five trained terriers _ appears and disappearswith great frequency.   ``The Wizard of Oz'' includes a cast of 42 performers, huge setsand computer robotics. But one of the most interesting effects inthe show is a simple piece of theatrics. When the witch melts, sheflattens herself down a staircase, unseeen by the audience.   Bill Campbell's costumes are a whimsical treat, especially theornate Munchkin attire. The Yellow Brick Road, though, is adisappointment. It's difficult to see, and just sort of pops upevery now and then. Dorothy and crew half-heartedly trot along.</TEXT></DOC>
