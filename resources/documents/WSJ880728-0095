General Motors Corp. is a case in point. In April, GM's General Motors Espana S.A. unit hired 1,000 more workers after local unions agreed to a third work shift at an Opel auto assembly plant. Then, another GM unit, Adam Opel AG, said it planned to cut its West German work force 10% by 1991, eliminating 5,200 jobs. Unlike their Spanish counterparts, the higher-paid German workers won't work nights or weekends. They promptly staged a strike.    The message of 1992 to labor is clear: European Community countries with lower wages, flexible work forces and lower taxes will be more likely to attract manufacturing jobs. Affluent workers could see their demands diluted if less-privileged workers from abroad begin breaking down union controls.    West German management sees it another way. With the highest labor costs in Europe and stiffer international competition pressuring profits, business executives from big companies like Daimler-Benz AG and Nixdorf Computer AG, to managers of small businesses are thinking about expanding to other European countries. U.S. and Japanese companies looking for European production sites are bypassing West Germany, which in 1987 lost more industrial investment than it gained.    It isn't hard to see why. The average Portuguese industrial employee works 309 hours, or 18% more a year, than the average West German worker, and receives less than one-sixth the hourly wages and benefits. At $18 an hour, West German wage-and-benefit costs are the highest in Europe; they exceed hourly Japanese and U.S. costs by more than 30%.    Labor redistribution after 1992 is expected to level some of the wide national wage and work-time differences. Industry analysts also predict a gradual redistribution of industries and jobs in the EC.    So far, there hasn't been a mass exodus of manufacturing jobs from West Germany and other high-wage EC countries. But union leaders see hard-won national labor packages jeopardized by new competition for jobs as trade and capital controls dissolve and Europe's 44 million union members become a common labor pool with widely divergent interests.    West German labor is seething: &quot;All this talk about the high cost of production in West Germany is a propaganda technique by industry to export jobs to cheap-wage countries,&quot; charges Peter Seideneck, a German union official responsible for European coordination. Says Ernst Breit, the chairman of the German Union Federation: &quot;This means that employers -- in no way only Germans -- not only want to use the open frontiers to strengthen profitability of companies, but they also want to sweep away everything that has been achieved in the way of safety and workplace regulations as well as wage and benefits contracts.&quot; He concedes that the German worker &quot;has the most to lose.&quot;    Mr. Breit is also president of the European Trade Union Confederation in Brussels, an umbrella organization for 44 million organized workers from the 12 EC nations and nine other European countries, all with varying degrees of social benefits, job security, safety regulations and work weeks. European union leaders are pushing through resolutions to standardize &quot;at high levels&quot; many of these issues. But European unions are still far from achieving a seamless labor front.    There isn't a lot of common ground between the workers of, say, West Germany and Portugal. &quot;After all the . . . lip service is paid to common European labor goals, the unions will look after themselves when it comes to jobs,&quot; says Gino Guigni, an Italian labor expert and a socialist member of the Italian parliament.    The degree of union organization also varies widely. West Germany has 7.7 million unionized workers, about half the total work force. But union penetration ranges from 75% in Belgium to less than 20% in France. On average, about 40% of West European workers are organized.    Economic development varies widely. Spain has a 20% jobless rate, compared with just over 8% in West Germany, where the jobless benefits are much higher. Spanish workers are willing to work longer hours, take shorter vacations and receive half the wages and benefits of their West German counterparts.    &quot;Unions in countries like Spain and Portugal and so on would be foolish to allow themselves to be steered into adopting the job-killing principles being championed by the German unions,&quot; says Albrecht Matuschka, a Munich-based international management consultant.    West Germany's position on labor costs doesn't augur well for its labor-intensive manufacturing jobs. Even Franz Steinkuehler, chairman of the IG Metall metalworkers union, Europe's largest labor union, acknowledges the 1992 changes give companies &quot;a tremendous strategic advantage&quot; over organized labor. Mr. Steinkuehler is a leading advocate of solidarity strikes across national boundaries.    Yet rank-and-file discipline is beginning to show cracks even in West Germany, where some union shop councils are starting to work nights and weekends. German union leaders say weakness in their own ranks underscores the need for a uniform European labor program. The European Trade Union Confederation in May endorsed resolutions focusing on standardizing labor benefits and social regulations throughout Europe. But while health benefits and safety norms fall within the province of governments, most have little direct influence on other benefits, wages and work hours. Labor and management will have to square off over those issues.    Industry analysts say countries such as Germany, with higher wages and a wider pool of skilled labor, will remain the preferred sites for highly automated plants and high-technology enterprises, while heavily subsidized labor-intensive industry will shift elsewhere.    Some say this could force a long-overdue overhaul of West Germany's economy. Says Mr. Matuschka, the Munich management consultant: &quot;In the long term, it will make us more efficient. . .&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
