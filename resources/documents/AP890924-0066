(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Residents who threatened to stormthis barrier island that has been off-limits and under martial lawsince Hurricane Hugo struck will get their first look at thedestruction on Monday.   ``When you come to the island, you better wear boots. There aresnakes all over the place,'' Mayor Carmen Bunch told about 500angry homeowners at a meeting Sunday in nearby Mount Pleasant.   Ms. Bunch, who said her own house was demolished, told islandersthey will be taken by ferry for a brief look and then returned tothe mainland. It will be at least midweek before they can return tostay, acting police chief Capt. James Arnold said.   Many homes have been weakened by the storm or are standing onjust one or two stilts, Arnold said.   ``(Saturday) night we just sat here and listened and we couldhear them falling and breaking. It's a very unsafe situation,''Arnold said.   Brushing back tears, the mayor asked people not to try to reachthe island on their own.   ``We're going to build the island back. We've got to stop theanarchy that's been talked about. We're not going to let anyonetake over the city by force,'' she said.   Some threatend to return home after the mayor failed to show upfor a Saturday meeting.   Ms. Bunch, with the permission of Gov. Carroll Campbell, placedthe island under martial law to keep order. The National Guard andstate wildlife officials are patrolling waterways to keep out allbut commercial fishermen and emergency crews.   Several people have been arrested for looting, officials said,and there is a danger to boaters from submerged boats, appliancesand debris in the surrounding waterways.   The island's marina was blown 300 yards away. A pile of at leasttwo dozen yachts and sailboats, some worth $200,000 or more, arecrammed like sardines onto neighboring Goat Island.   Sullivan's Island Mayor Melvin Anderegg also imposed martial lawbut said a committee was set up to develop a plan to get residentsto their homes.   ``If I had my way, I would keep people off for a couple moredays, but they'd lynch me,'' he said.   John Selby, a resident of Sullivan's Island, said it was abouttime.   ``What the people are angry about is they can't go out, inspectthe property and maybe do a little damage control,'' Selby said.   The Ben Sawyer bridge, which connects Sullivan's Island and Isleof Palms to Mount Pleasant, is submerged in the IntracoastalWaterway. It could be one or two weeks before a temporary bridge isinstalled, said Herman Snyder, an engineer for the state Departmentof Highways and Public Transportation.   Sullivan's Island and Isle of Palms, located 15 miles fromCharleston, are home to about 6,000 people. They were the first tofeel the force of Hugo's 135 mph winds.</TEXT></DOC>
