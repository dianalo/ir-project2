The company said Minneapolis-based Northern States agreed in December 1985 to purchase 40% of its Clay Boswell Unit 4 electric-generating plant near Grand Rapids, Minn., as well as electric energy from generating facilities in North Dakota. The total value of the transaction was $179.5 million.    Minnesota Power said Northern States Power recently filed a lawsuit to nullify the sale agreement. A spokeswoman for Northern States Power said the company asked the district court in Hennepin County, Minn., to resolve a contract-interpretation dispute between the two companies. She said the purchase depended on the advanced approval by the Commission and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. The Minnesota Public Utilities Commission has already approved the purchase, but she said the FERC has &quot;refused to rule on the prudence of the investment&quot;, therefore the contract isn't binding.    The company said it isn't possible to predict whether the agreement will proceed, therefore, it must ask that the credit, which represents an average rate reduction of 3.15%, be suspended until it is clear that Northern States is required to proceed. Minnesota Power said that if the credit is suspended, the typical residential electricity customer could expect a bill to increase 1.06% annually.    The transaction with Northern States is scheduled to be phased in starting in May 1989, and Minnesota Power said its customers have benefited since July 1987 from rates that reflect the expected profit from the sale. </TEXT></DOC>
