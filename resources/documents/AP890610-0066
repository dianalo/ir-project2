Pat Swindall's attorneys havepared by five the 37 allegations of perjury for which he is on trialand are preparing to call at least three congressmen to testify.   U.S. District Judge Richard C. Freeman ruled Friday that the fiveof the 37 alleged statements that gave rise to perjury charges arenot relevant to the case.   But he did not throw out any of the 10 perjury charges outright,saying he would take defense motions for dismissal under advisement.The 32 remaining disputed statements are divided among the 10charges.   While the jury took a day off in the 2-week-old trial, Freemanalso indicated that he personally believes at least some ofSwindall's allegedly perjurious statements were indeed false.   Swindall was accused of lying to a federal grand jury in early1988 about his 1987 dealings with an undercover agent posing as amoney launderer, and with a Swindall associate since convicted ofmoney laundering. Swindall was negotiating to obtain $850,000 fromthe agent for construction of his home.   The statements eliminated from the case involved questioningabout whether two exact terms were used during Swindall's moneydiscussions _ ``narcotic'' and ``hiding'' as it pertained to thesource of the money.   Defense attorney Richard Hendrix has subpoenaed at least threemembers of Congress to testify in the case, presumably in an effortto refute the prosecution notion that Swindall should have beenfamiliar with money-laundering laws. The three are Rep. HowardCoble, R-N.C., Rep. Alex McMillan, R-N.C., and Rep. Barney Frank,D-Mass.   House officials have filed a motion to quash the subpoenas ofCoble and McMillan, which Freeman on Friday deferred ruling on untilit becomes obvious they are to be called. The Coble-McMillan motionsaid that Frank is expected to respond separately.   Hendrix did not say how many congressional representatives he hassubpoenaed, but he said some have indicated they will testify. Thejury returns Monday to begin hearing the defense portion of the case.   Swindall, a two-term Republican, lost his seat in a bitterlycontested race to Democrat Ben Jones, a former actor on television's``Dukes of Hazzard,'' last November, after the indictment wasreturned.   His attorneys contend he was duped by friend and associateCharles LeChasney, who acted as middleman in the loan deal.   Swindall testified before the grand jury that he ``walked away''from the money deal after a Sept. 13, 1987, meeting with LeChasneyand the undercover agent.   ``The evidence is clear he didn't walk away from it,'' Freemansaid in court Friday. ``The statement is literally false.''</TEXT></DOC>
