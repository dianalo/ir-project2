(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A New Jersey clothing manufacturer wassentenced to three years in prison in the nation's largest payrolltax evasion case, authorities said Monday.   Jerome A. Finkelstein, 63, could have received 35 years inprison for his guilty plea to charges he failed to pay income andSocial Security taxes on $1 million in wages paid to illegalaliens, mostly Polish, said U.S. Attorney Samuel A. Alito Jr.   Finkelstein owned a factory destroyed in a Labor Day 1985 firein Passaic, N.J., that destroyed 27 buildings housing 100 familiesand 60 companies and that caused an estimated $400 million indamage. Authorities said about 80 to 100 people worked atFinkelstein's factory.   U.S. District Judge Joseph H. Rodriquez in Camden also gaveFinkelstein, of Englewood, N.J., five years probation at thesentencing Friday.   He was accused of paying the $1 million in wages in 1981 and1982 out of a separate checking acount. He operated a group ofwomen's clothing companies under the umbrella name EuropeanTailoring Group Ltd. of Passaic.   Alito said it was the largest case of payroll withholding taxevasion in the United States.   In court papers, Finkelstein said hiring the aliens helped ``thepolicy of the United States government at that time ... to aid andassist those who were struggling for survival of the SolidarityLabor Union and otherwise seeking freedom from Communistoppression,'' according to Alito's office.   He claimed it was unfair to make illegal aliens pay taxes to thegovernment when they received nothing in return ``as a matter oflaw.''   Finkelstein's wife Ethel wrote the judge saying that herhusband's company made clothes for top designers including RalphLauren, Oscar De La Renta, Bill Blass and Calvin Klein, accordingto Alito.</TEXT></DOC>
