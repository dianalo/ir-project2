Environmental radioactivity is detectedusing GM counters, NaI scintillators and portable Ge detectors, the electronicinstrumentation is situated in a mobil station. Dose rates and radioactiveconcentrations in the soil are calculated by means of the Poker-Campcode. The in-situ measuring methods were comparatively evaluated. Internationalintercomparison runs approved the reliability of the analysis. Accordingto the natural background survey carried out between 1979-82 the environmentof the Paks Nuclear Power Plant had a moderate level of natural radioactivity.(V.N.) 14 refs.; 5 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
