Cardiologists have long wanted a way to check how wellblood is flowing through a patient's brain or heart topinpoint trouble spots that presage heart attacks or strokes.To measure blood flow today, doctors inject a patient with aradioactive substance and trace it with scanning machines forrelatively imprecise results.   A new technology, echo-planar magnetic resonance imaging,promises to produce &quot;videos&quot; of blood flow that computers canmeasure. The technology employs MRI machines, which hospitalsuse to create images of the brain, spine and organs.   Existing MRI machines are too slow to trace blood flow,spending as much as 12 minutes to produce the &quot;stack&quot; of 20images that make up a three-dimensional picture of an organ.In echo-planar MRI, the machines are rewired and reprogrammedto take a rapid-fire series of images in about 30 seconds,putting together what amounts to a short video.   A computer &quot;watches&quot; the movie and calculates how fastblood is flowing. Slow flow in a brain vessel could indicatea clot that could lead to a stroke; in part of the heart, itcould indicate an imminent heart attack.   Echo-planar MRI still requires a new contrasting agent, asubstance injected to highlight blood. Salutar, a Sunnyvale,Calif., maker of contrasting agents, and the University ofCalifornia are working with a grant from the state to developsuch an agent. A cardiologist at the university's SanFrancisco medical school says that echo-planar MRI has shown&quot;very promising&quot; results in animal tests, but that regulatoryapproval could take at least three years.                                                                                                          Desktop Publishers Try   To Agree on Colors                                                                                                          COMPUTER makers want color to do for desktop publishingwhat it did for television, but first they have to getequipment to agree on colors.   Today's computer printers, displays and scanners don't seecolors alike -- the red that a scanner &quot;sees&quot; may translateinto a different red on the computer screen and yet anotherhue on the printer. Such color disagreement is troublesome indesktop publishing, in which scanners electronically &quot;cutout&quot; images from paper illustrations and send them to thecomputer for editing and then on to a printer.   Computer and software companies are devising &quot;colormanagement&quot; software that understands the quirks ofindividual scanners, displays and printers, and gets them toagree on internationally standard colors. Electronics ForImaging, San Bruno, Calif., plans to sell a program to helpsoftware developers build color-management capabilities intoapplication software for Apple Computer's Macintoshes.Tektronix sells such software for workstations, while EastmanKodak Co. plans to sell software next year for Macs andIBM-compatible personal computers that will let usersautomatically calibrate their PCs with scanners and printers.                                                                                                          Superconductor Devices   Get a Head Start in U.S.                                                                                                          AMERICAN start-ups may get a jump on commercializinghigh-temperature superconductors.   When such superconductors -- ceramic materials that carryelectricity with no resistance at about minus 320 degreesFahrenheit -- were discovered in 1987, conventional wisdomhad it that the Japanese would be the first to bring them tomarket in superfast computer chips and extrasensitivesensors.   But several small California companies say they are closeto market with superconducting quantum interference devices(Squids), sensors that can detect minute magnetic forces.Biomagnetic Technologies, San Diego, has developed asuperconducting transistor, called a Josephson junction,that's &quot;quieter&quot; than any previous such device. It plans tobuild the transistor into Squids for use in medical equipmentthat detects faint electric pulses in the heart and brain.   Engineers at Conductus, Sunnyvale, Calif., are the firstto build a Squid that combines on a single chip a Josephsonjunction and a tiny antenna that can detect magnetic fieldsnearly a billionth the strength of the magnetic field thatturns a compass needle. Conductus, which plans to sell itsfirst Squid next year, says its device could be used todetect microscopic cracks in airplane wings, to find mineraldeposits or to predict earthquakes by picking up slightchanges in the Earth's magnetic forces.   Meanwhile, Hewlett-Packard, which has an equity interestin Conductus, says it has devised a method of depositing athin superconducting film on sapphire chips that can cut by90% the cost of making superconducting chips such as Squids.                                                                                                          Odds and Ends                                                                                                          SOME COMPANIES looking for an alternative to aerosols forspray products have turned to a technology that uses a rubberbladder to squeeze a liquid out of a nozzle. Pressure inexisting rubber-bladder systems, though, isn't as high asaerosols and tends to peter out as the bladder shrinks.Alipresus, a start-up in Santa Ana, Calif., has a bladdertechnology it says can deliver a steady stream throughout aproduct's life. Alipresus acquired the technology from BaxterInternational, which uses it to deliver intravenous drugs. .. . The PC has met &quot;The Far Side.&quot; Amaze, a Kirkland, Wash.,software house, has melded Gary Larson's popular cartoonsinto its calendar software. Mr. Larson added surprises,including random sequences such as a cartoon pterodactyl thatflies uninvited across the screen.</TEXT></DOC>
