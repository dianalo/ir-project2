The patent covers Recombivax HB, produced by Merck andamp; Co., a Rahway, N.J., health-products concern, which holds exclusive world-wide rights licensed under the patent, the university said.    The patent specifically covers the hepatitis B surface antigen produced from genetically engineered yeast and the resulting vaccine. The university said it developed the vaccine in a collaborative effort with the University of Washington and Merck.    Last April, Biogen N.V. in Cambridge, Mass., said it licensed a unit of SmithKline Beckman Corp. to make and sell genetically engineered hepatitis B vaccine products. Biogen's general counsel, Frederick A. Eustis, said the company hadn't any comment on the patent covering Merck's product pending a review by Biogen's patent attorneys. </TEXT></DOC>
