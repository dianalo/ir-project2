Maytag Chairman Daniel J. Krumm would not identify the potentialbuyers for Jenn Industries of Indianapolis, Ind., and Magic Chef ofBellevue, Ohio.   ``These are good operations, but the products they manufacturedo not serve markets that are significant to Maytag, nor do theycontribute substantially to our earnings,'' Krumm said in astatement.   Combined sales of the two companies totaled $86.7 million in1987, when Maytag reported total net sales of $1.9 billion.   Jenn Industries, which employs about 100 people, makes powerexhaust units and ventilation equipment. Magic Chef, with about 400employees, makes residential furnaces and air conditioners.   ``Selling these operations will permit us to concentrate effortsand financial resources in our core businesses of full-size majorappliances and vending equipment, which is where we can achieve thelatest long-term benefit,'' Krumm said.   The planned sales are part of a reorganization that beganshortly after Maytag and Magic Chef merged in 1986.
