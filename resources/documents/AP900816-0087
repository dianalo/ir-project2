U.S. District Judge James Rosenbaum instructed the jury toconsider separately whether the defendants are guilty of operatingan aircraft while under the influence of alcohol.   Rosenbaum said jurors should consider this definition of beingunder the influence of alcohol: When a person is so affected byalcohol that he lacks ``clearness of intellect and control ofhimself that he would otherwise have.''   Jurors got the case after hearing closing arguments andrebuttals Wednesday and today.   In their closing arguments, defense attorneys said their clientsmay have used poor judgment by drinking the night before flying aBoeing 727, but they are innocent of flying-while-intoxicatedcharges.   ``It's not against the law to drink alcohol and fly a plane.Maybe it should be,'' Peter Wold, attorney for Capt. Norman LyleProuse, said in closing arguments Wednesday. ``It's only againstthe law if you are under the influence ... and there is not onepiece of evidence suggesting he was.''   Prouse, 51, of Conyers, Ga., 1st Officer Robert Kirchner, 36, ofHighland Ranch, Colo., and flight engineer Joseph Balzer, 35, ofAntioch, Tenn., have been on trial since July 25 on charges ofoperating an aircraft while under the influence of alcohol.   Closing arguments for Balzer were scheduled today in U.S.District Court.   According to undisputed testimony, Balzer and Kirchner sharedbeer from at least six pitchers and Prouse consumed 15 to 20 rumand colas at a lounge in Moorhead, Minn., on March 7. A waitresstestified that Balzer and Kirchner left about 10:30 p.m. and Prouseleft about 11:30 p.m. Six hours later, on March 8, the trio flew aBoeing 727 with 91 passengers from Fargo, N.D., to the Twin Cities.   ``It was stupid of him (Kirchner) to stay in the bar,'' defenseattorney William Mauzy said.   But Mauzy cautioned: ``Don't condemn them because they were in abar, because that's not what they are charged with.''   The case marks the U.S. Justice Department's first prosecutionunder a 1988 federal law prohibiting operation of a common carrierwhile under the influence of alcohol. The law doesn't specify ablood-alcohol content for pilots. To return guilty verdicts, jurorsmust conclude the pilots were impaired.   Defense attorneys said the smoothness of the flight showed thepilots were not impaired.   ``There wasn't anything about that flight that wasn't perfect,''Mauzy said. ``That's the best evidence you need to know aboutwhether Bob Kirchner was impaired.''   Assistant U.S. Attorney Elizabeth de la Vega said in her closingargument that the pilots were able to handle Flight 650 because itwas routine. She reminded jurors that a Northwest pilot called as adefense witness described flying as ``hours of boredom punctuatedby minutes of terror.''   ``These three defendants were not capable to respond to thoseminutes of terror,'' de la Vega said.   In tests about two hours after the flight landed, Kirchnershowed a blood-alcohol concentration of 0.06 percent, Balzer showed0.08 percent, and Prouse showed 0.13 percent. Prouse'sblood-alcohol level was more than the legal limit for driving a carin many states, which is 0.10 percent.   The federal felony carries a maximum 15 years in prison and a$250,000 fine.   The three pilots were fired for violating Northwest's 12-hourprohibition against drinking before flying.   In a report in the New England Journal of Medicine today, twodoctors said even a little alcohol can hinder pilots' ability tofly, and recommended that federal rules bar pilots from taking thecontrols until at least 12 hours after their last drink.   ``The weight of the evidence suggests that even small amounts ofalcohol can have a profoundly negative effect on flight safety,''said Drs. Jack G. Modell and James M. Mountz of the University ofMichigan.</TEXT></DOC>
