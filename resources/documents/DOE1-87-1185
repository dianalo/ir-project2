Themost immediate impacts on the energy sector will mainly occur in theoil, uranium and electricity sectors. In the longer term, the intangibleand indirect impacts are likely to be considerably more important. Themore secure access to the US market will make the energy sector's realizationof its potential to generate revenues and create jobs throughout Canadamore likely. Enhanced investor confidence, due to creation of a morestable trading environment, will assist Canadian energy resource development.By improving the prospects for obtaining the economies of scale thatcan be obtained by access to US markets, the Agreement could facilitatethe development of certain megaprojects. Canada's energy security willnot be compromised, and there will be no significant impact on domesticenergy prices. While the Agreement does not preclude a Canadian regulatedprice for oil and gas which is less than the world price, it does makesuch a policy less attractive. While there is nothing in the Agreementthat precludes governments from setting domestic energy prices higherthan export prices, the Agreement constrains Canada's ability to useimport controls on US energy imports to achieve such an objective. Artificiallylow or high energy prices distort decision making possibly to the detrimentof overall economic growth. Under the current market-based energy pricingsystem, domestic prices will tend to equal export prices. The Agreementis thus consistent with the way Canadian energy pricing policy has beenevolving. 4 figs., 7 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
