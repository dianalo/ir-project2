The most obvious impact of the energy woes came in the losers' column, where four of the 10 companies with the biggest declines in percentage terms -- Extex Energy Development Ltd., Ensource Inc., Kaneb Sevices Inc. and Tidewater Inc. -- were oil and gas companies.    The biggest loser, First City Bancorp. of Texas, whose stock tumbled 74%, is a Houston-based bank holding company hit hard by problem loans for both energy and real estate.    Another, Dallas-based LTV Corp., became the largest industrial company to file for bankruptcy-law protection, partly because of its energy unit's woes, and also because of weak demand among energy companies for its tubular steel.    Even as it hammered the losers, the oil price drop, which saw one benchmark Texas crude fall from $26.57 a barrel in early January to $10.42 in March before rebounding to near $18 by year's end, also helped many of the winners.    Cheaper oil eased inflationary expectations, in turn lowering interest rates and boosting price/earnings multiples for all stocks. At the same time, lower gasoline prices and interest rates put more money in consumers' pockets, which helped a broad swath of consumer-related stocks.    Four of the 10 biggest gainers on the Big Board-Reebok International Ltd., Circuit City Stores Inc., Roper Corp. and Gap Inc. -- sell consumer goods. Reebok sells trendy sneakers, Circuit City is an electronics retailer, Roper sells appliances and tools, and Gap stores sell clothing. A fifth winner, Patten Corp., sells rustic home sites to individuals.    Turnarounds of companies whose results had suffered in recent years also played a big part in boosting many of the best-performing stocks, including the year's top gainer, Service Resources Corp., whose shares soared 235%.    Under the Norlin Corp. name, which it held until last March, the financial printer and back-office service provider saw its stock decline from $38.625 in early 1984 to a low of $3.625 in 1985 as it racked up heavy losses.    But a series of refinancings begun in late 1985 enabled the concern to trim its losses, and in December its Charles P. Young andamp; Co. financial printing unit launched a $305 million bid, subject to arranging financing, for Pandick Inc., another printer.    L.E. Myers Co. Group, a utility construction contractor, also cut its losses after restructuring its debt. First Capital Holdings Corp. boosted its earnings from a low base.    Mark Tavel, executive vice president at Value Line Inc., noted that Roper &quot;went from a defict to record earnings in 1986 due to strong appliance demand.&quot; And the Gap stores' shift from an emphasis on Levi denim to bright-colored shirts and other apparel has already become part of retailing legend.    One oddity on the winners list is Banco Central SA, Spain's biggest bank. Its shares were helped by the boom in the tiny Madrid stock market, which doubled in 1986 after Spain entered the Common Market. The company's American depository receipts are traded on the Big Board. Its high percentage of fixed-income loans also would have been an advantage as interest rates dropped during the year.    Another foreign stock, Philippine Long Distance Telephone Co., was the year's best performer on the American Stock Exchange. It was helped by a strong rally in the Philippine stock market following the departure of Ferdinand Marcos as the nation's president.    The biggest loser on the Amex was another energy victim, ConVest Energy Partners, a master limited partnership that suspended its quarterly distributions in July.    In the over-the-counter market, both the best and the worst results were turned in by telecommunications companies. The best, Digitech Inc., makes telecommunications and electronics products. And the worst, SpecTran Corp., posted losses on a steep drop in sales of its optical fibers.    Suresh Bihrud, chief investment strategist at First Boston Corp., said groups that have shown consistent earnings growth were helped the most by expanding multiples. They included pollution control, drugs, food, cosmetic and beverage stocks.    The falling dollar also helped such groups as chemicals and paper, and strong consumer spending helped retailers and household furnishings concerns, Mr. Bihrud added.    Groups that did the worst included basic raw materials such as aluminum, copper and steel, which need inflation to do well.    Another group that fared poorly was technology. Two of the 10 biggest losers were GCA Corp., which makes equipment for semiconductor companies, firms that have been ailing because of the computer slump, and Floating Point Systems Inc., a computer maker whose sales abruptly fell short of expectations.    Bruce Calvert, director of research for Alliance Capital Management, noted that in the second half, smaller, more volatile stocks underperformed steadier, big-capitalization issues. In that period, broader market indexes failed to keep pace with the 30 large stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial Average.    At the same time, a widely anticipated rotation of market leadership to cyclical, economically sensitive stocks didn't materialize because &quot;the economy never came through,&quot; said Laszlo Birinyi Jr., manager of equity market analysis at Salomon Brothers Inc.    ---             Big Board's 10 Best Performers               Closing   Net    Percent Common Stock  Price     Gain   Change   Comments Service       15 1/2+  10 7/8  +235.1%  Financial printer, Resources                               formerly Norlin                                         Corp., trimmed                                         losses and                                         restructured.
