For now, at least, they're getting a pretty good deal.    Money-fund yields, on average, are still almost two full percentage points above money-market accounts at banks and thrifts and almost a percentage point higher than most certificates of deposit. They're also ahead of Treasury bills.    But that doesn't mean that they'll always be the best investment. &quot;Don't look at them as a lifetime commitment,&quot; says Edward D. McCarthy, a Providence, R.I., financial planner. &quot;A lot of people put their money in and then sit there and watch the rates go down.&quot;    People certainly have been putting money in -- more than $1 billion in the latest week, alone. Assets of the 387 funds tracked by Donoghue's Money Fund Report, a Holliston, Mass., newsletter, now stand at a record $332.3 billion. William E. Donoghue, publisher of the publication, says assets could double in the next two years.    That's largely because yields are comfortably ahead of most comparable investments. The latest seven-day compound yield, which assumes reinvestment of dividends, averages 8.68%, according to Donoghue's, with the top funds yielding well over 9%. That compares with an average 7.01% on bank money-market accounts and 7.92% on six-month CDs, as reported by Banxquote Money Markets, a New York information service. Six-month Treasury bills sold at Monday's auction yielded 8.26%.    &quot;People are looking for the best rate that's out there,&quot; says Susanne Mahoney, vice president, marketing, at giant Fidelity Investments. Fidelity's Spartan Fund has been among the top performers since it was launched last January. Ms. Mahoney says Fidelity's own research indicates that much of the $125 million or so flowing into the Spartan Fund each week is coming from bank accounts. &quot;As CDs have matured, people haven't wanted to roll over at lower rates,&quot; she says.    Interest rates in general have fallen about a percentage point since the spring, although there have been some small increases in the last week as reports have indicated that the economy may not be weak enough for the Federal Reserve to ease credit further.    Money-fund managers can prop up yields by varying the maturities of their investments -- Treasury securities, certificates of deposit and commercial paper, or short-term corporate IOUs, for the most part. Maturities tend to lengthen as rates decline, to take advantage of higher rates for as long as possible, just as they shorten as rates rise to grab higher rates as soon as possible.    The average maturity of the funds tracked by Donoghue's was 40 days for the week ended Tuesday. That's down from 41 days last week and 42 days the week before, but average maturity was as short as 29 days at the start of the year as rates climbed.    The shorter maturities of the past two weeks are &quot;an indication that portfolio managers and analysts now feel that rates are going to go down gradually and slowly,&quot; says Susan Cook, editor of Money Fund Report. She adds that money-fund yields probably will decline a few hundredths of a percentage point each week for the next month or so. The seven-day averages for the latest week were unchanged from the prior week.    (The average seven-day simple yield remained unchanged at 8.33%. The average 30-day compound yield was 8.81% in the week ended Tuesday, down from 8.90%, and the average 30-day simple yield fell to 8.45% from 8.53%.)    At Dreyfus Worldwide Dollar Money Market Fund, Joseph DiMartino, portfolio manager and president of Dreyfus Corp., is keeping maturities short because short-term investments are currently the highest-yielding segment of the market. The fund's average maturity currently is 27 days. &quot;You have to give up yield to go long,&quot; he says, noting that the 30-year Treasury bond currently is yielding just about 8.10%.    Some fund managers also absorb all or part of the fund's expenses, either as a regular policy or to make a new fund more attractive. Fidelity, for example, currently is deducting only 0.10 of a percentage point to cover Spartan's expenses and has pledged that expenses won't go over 0.45% at least until May 7, 1992. Dreyfus Worldwide Dollar, which also began operations early this year, currently is waiving all expenses and says it will continue to do so at least until the fund's assets reach $3 billion, or Oct. 2, 1989, when it will consider a further extension.    The average fund's expense ratio, or annual expenses as a percentage of assets, is about 0.75%. That means a fund earning 10% in interest from its securities would deliver a yield to investors of 9.25%.    There's some disagreement among economists about which way interest rates are headed from here. Some predict rates will decline steadily; others predict a bump upwards and then a decline and still others forecast an increase. Such an uncertain outlook can make money funds more attractive. &quot;They allow an investor to make a decision without making a lot of other decisions,&quot; says Gerald M. Cole, executive vice president and managing director of Kemper Financial Services. Money funds can appear to be more attractive than other income-oriented investments when interest rates are falling because money-fund yields decline more slowly. But if interest rates continue to fall, investors who stick with the funds may regret having failed to lock in longer-term returns when yields were higher. As attractive as current money-fund yields are, investors could have locked in a full percentage point more by switching to a one-year CD in late April.    Some institutional investors have been taking advantage of the recent increase in rates by switching out of funds and into Treasurys and other money-market investments. While assets of general-purpose money funds, those aimed at individuals, rose $2.5 billion in the latest week, according to Donoghue's, assets of funds open only to institutions declined $1.1 billion.    Some professional money managers are reluctant to take a position on interest rates. &quot;With the volatility we have right now, it's really a question of day-to-day monitoring,&quot; says Michael D. Hirsch, senior vice president and chief investment officer for Republic National Bank in New York.    ---@ Money-Fund Yields @ (Week ended Aug. 15) @ 7-Day 7-Day @ Compound Simple @Fund/Assets Yield Yield @Harbor Money Market Fund* @$44.4 million 10.55% 10.04% @Dreyfus Worldwide Dollar** @$2.5 billion 9.65 9.22 @Fidelity Spartan** @$3.4 billion 9.53 9.11 @Alger Money Market Portfolio** @$58.8 million 9.42 9.01 @Vanguard MMR Prime @$10.0 billion 9.21 8.82 @AVERAGE TAXABLE FUND 8.68% 8.33%    *Yield includes capital gains, fluctuates widely from week to week    **Fund manager absorbing part or all of expenses @Source: Donoghue's Money Fund Report </TEXT></DOC>
