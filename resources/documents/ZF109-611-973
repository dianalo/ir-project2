 A'backlash' of workers and microcomputer managers who aredisappointed with the graphical environment has emerged; some'Windows victims' even talk of forming a support group for thosefrustrated by Windows' failure to show immediate, dramaticbenefits.andP;  Windows managers are pressured by users from below andby upper management, which is asking them to prove that the switchto Windows was worth its cost.andP;  One user says that Windows has notmade users more productive and has actually decreased productivityin some situations.andP;  Windows does not suffer from fundamentalflaws, but its benefits have been oversold or stated prematurely.andM;</SUMMARY><DESCRIPT>Product:   Microsoft Windows 3.0 (Graphical user interface) (Usage).andO;Topic:     Graphical User InterfaceSoftware SelectionUser BehaviorUser Groups.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>We are all focusing on the success of Windows 3.0 these days -- as I did inthis space last week, when I argued that wide acceptance of Windows is goingto drive the color-portables market.andM;I'm a believer .andP;  .  .  sort of.andP;  I use Windows a lot, but not all the time.andO;I use some Windows applications, but more &quot;old apps.&quot; And I like Windows3.0---not just better than I liked earlier versions of Windows (whichwouldn't be hard), but on its own merits.andM;Yet it's increasingly clear that not everyone who has installed Windows isquite so happy with it.andP;  There's a distinct &quot;Windows backlash&quot; of workers andmicro managers who have experienced results far short of the claimed benefitsof GUIs in general and Windows in particular.andM;That was brought home to me a couple of weeks ago, when I spoke at the annualvendor fair and conference sponsored by the Chicago Area MicrocomputerProfessionals (CAMP).andM;CAMP has emerged over the past few years as the largest and most powerfulgroup of microcomputer management and support people in the country.andP;  Ablyled by Julian Horwich, CAMP's reach far exceeds the Chicago area; it isnational in scope and impact, if not yet in name.andM;Bill Gates spoke at the conference, too, and gave anotherWindows-cheerleading speech.andP;  No criticism intended: That's his job aschairman of Microsoft.andP;  But his relentlessly positive &quot;the war is over --Windows has won&quot; comments annoyed a number of attendees in the &quot;I WentWindows and Regret It&quot; camp.andM;I spent several hours after the speech-making talking with CAMP attendees,and a lot of those &quot;Windows victims&quot; told me their tales of woe.andM;One of them asked me, entirely seriously, to come back to help him get a&quot;Windows Survivors Support Group&quot; started.andP;  He said he fell into that groupof people who had jumped too soon and now knew it, but didn't know what todo.andM;&quot;We need something like the support groups they have for the families ofpeople who have become addicted to something evil,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;We need helpgetting through the night.&quot;andM;The idea was a funny one, and I laughed.andP;  But he didn't.andM;Those who have been &quot;Windowed,&quot; in the words of another IC staffer who pulledme aside at CAMP, are getting hammered from below (by users) and from above(by management); they're being asked to deliver signs that the switch toWindows computing was worth it.andM;Those users -- often users who themselves clamored for moving to Windows --are coming back now, after two or three months or more of steady Windows use,and saying, in effect, &quot;Where's the beef?&quot;andM;&quot;When are these big benefits going to kick in?&quot; they ask.andP;  They're over thelearning hump; they're reasonably comfortable with Windows and itsapplications, but they're not any more productive.andP;  Worse, some things seemto take longer.andM;More than one IC manager has told me over the past couple of months that theyhave storerooms full of Windows packages they haven't yet put on users'machines, and that they've frozen further proliferation of Windows throughouttheir shops until they can get a better feel for how well the conversion isworking out.andM;There's nothing fundamentally wrong with Windows.andP;  There are a few technicalglitches, but nothing crippling.andM;But the benefits of Windows have been oversold.andP;  Or, at least, prematurelysold.andP;  White papers full of promises of increased productivity aren't provingto be very accurate predictors of real-world experience.andM;I don't shrink from my view that, for many PC users, Windows is a smart move,nor from the notion that the future of PCs lies in graphical environments.andP;  Ijust wish the noise level hadn't been so high this year.andP;  We might have beenable to hear those thoughtful voices asking if perhaps, for now, Windowswasn't a selective rather than a universal answer.andM;And a lot of us would have looked a little harder before we leaped.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
