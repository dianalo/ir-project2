In Bush's budget, trees make out like bandits,too. So do robots.   In every presidential budget proposal there are winners andlosers, but Congress often reverses their order by the time it hasworked its will, usually after August.   This year's loser candidates are familiar targets: owners ofboats, riders of trains, buses and subways, children from affluenthomes eating subsidized school lunches. Those kids would berequired, under Bush's budget, to pay the full cost of lunch,adding about 29 cents per meal to their outlay.   President Reagan tried to trim their subsidies, too. Congressbalked. Now Bush has taken up the call.   In an even more pragmatic attack on the deficit, Bush proposesto make it harder to get away with cheating on taxes. He wants to``close the gap between taxes owed and taxes paid.''   Toward that end, his budget seeks more money for enforcement ofthe tax laws, specifically for collecting delinquent taxes,checking out fake dependent claims, auditing mortgage interestdeductions, and matching what the taxpayer says he received ininterest against what interest payers say they paid.   In other time-worn economy proposals, Bush asks Congress to makerecreational and commercial boat owners pay a $25 fee; to quitsubsidizing Amtrak, a step that could jeopardize long-distance railtravel, and to end big city mass transit subsidies that help payfor day-to-day operations. Municipal taxpayers should shoulder thatburden, says Bush.   ``The federal government's responsibility is not to run therailroads,'' explained Richard Darman, the president's budgetdirector.   The president's budget, however, is intrigued with morefuturistic transportation, like magnetic levitation, ``a newtransportation technology that relies on the use of magnets forpropulsion and levitation rather than conventionalsteel-wheel-on-rail technology.'' Bush proposed spending $9.7million to check it out.   Along the same lines, the president calls for spending $192million on robots, ``intelligent machine systems that do physicalwork.''   Most robots today work in structured environments or under closehuman supervision, the budget notes, so federal research shouldfocus on building ``more autonomous'' robots ``capable ofinteracting with a changing and uncertain environment.''   Meantime, in a sharp break with predecessor Ronald Reagan, whosaid in his 1980 campaign for the White House that trees causepollution, Bush embraced trees. His budget proposed planting abillion of them a year on private land into the indefinite future.   He called for initiating a community ``plant a tree'' initiativethat would line the streets of America with 30 million more trees.In most cities, he said, only one tree is planted for every fourremoved.   The president said more trees would fight the threat of globalwarming, combat the pollution of streams, prevent soil erosion andsave energy.   Dense evergreens closely placed around a house can cut fuelbills by 20 percent, the president said, and an acre of woodland iscapable of removing as much as nine tons of carbon dioxide from theair.   Even though 3{ million acres of trees a year are planted in theUnited States, more are lost. Total woodlands decline by 700,000acres a year, the budget says.</TEXT></DOC>
