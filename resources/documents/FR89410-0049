Authority and Background  </ITAG>Section 315 of the CZMA, U.S.C. 1461, establishes the National EstuarineReserve Research System (formerly known as the National Estuarine SanctuaryProgram). Subsection 315 (e)(1)(B) authorizes the Marine and EstuarineManagement Division (MEMD) of the Office of Ocean and Coastal ResourceManagement (OCRM), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA),to make grants to any coastal state or public or private person for purposesof supporting research and monitoring within the NERRS.  <ITAG tagnum="85">II. Information on Established National Estuarine Research Reserves </ITAG>The National Estuarine Reserve Research System (NERRS) consists of carefullyselected estuarine areas of the United States which are designated, preserved,and managed for research and educational purposes. The reserves are chosento reflect regional differences to include a variety of types in accordancewith the classification scheme of the national program as presented in15 CFR Part 921 (49 FR 125:26502-26520). The uniqueness of each NERRS site lies in their suitability for supportinga wide range of beneficial uses of ecological, economic, recreational,and aesthetic value which are dependent upon maintenance of a healthy ecosystem.Each site provides critical habitat for wide range of ecologically andcommercially important species of fish, shellfish, birds, and aquatic andterrestrial wildlife. However, these varied activities occurring both withinand outside the reserves have caused varying levels of impacts that threatenthe health and survival of natural resources. On the national level, theseimpacts have been classified into five major environmental problem areas:toxic contamination, eutrophication, pathogen contamination, habitat lossand alteration, and changes in living resources.  Each reserve has been designed to be large enough and protected well enoughto ensure its efffectiveness as a conservation unit and as a site for long-termresearch. Since all of the reserves are part of a national system, theycollectively provide a unique opportunity to address research questionsand estuarine management issues of national significance.  Eighteen national estuarine research reserves have been established:  <ITAG tagnum="15">Weeks Bay, Alabama   </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Elkhorn Slough, California   </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Tijuana River, California   </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Apalachicola, Florida   </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Rookery Bay, Florida   </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Sapelo Island, Georgia   </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Waimanu Valley, Hawaii   </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Wells, Maine   </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Monie Bay (Chesapeake Bay), Maryland   </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Waquoit Bay, Massachusetts   </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Great Bay, New Hampshire   </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Hudson River, New York   </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">North Carolina System, North Carolina   </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Old Woman Creek, Ohio   </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">South Slough, Oregon   </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Jobos Bay, Puerto Rico   </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Narragansett Bay, Rhode Island   </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Padilla Bay, Washington  </ITAG>These reserves are depicted in Figure 1; on-site reserve contacts and addressesare provided in Appendix I.  <ITAG tagnum="84">III. Availability of Funds  </ITAG>Funds are available on a competitive basis on any state or university,or qualified public or private individual to conduct research within nationalestuarine research reserves.  Level funding for FY 90 research projects is expected. The approximaterange of Federal funding per successful project has been between $10,000and $40,000. For Fiscal Year 1990, a cap of $50,000 per project (Federalfunding) has been established. Proposals submitted may not exceed thisamount; those exceeding this established maximum will be returned to theproposer. Federal funds requested must be matched on an equal basis bycash or the value of goods and services directly benefitting the projectin accordance with 15 CFR Part 24, ``Grants and Cooperative Agreementswith State and Local Governments'' (see also OMB Circular A-102_``UniformAdministrative Requirements for Grants-In-Aid to State and Local Governments''),A-87, ``Principles for Determining Costs Applicable to Grants and Contractswith State, Local and Federally Recognized Indian Tribal Governments'',and A-110, ``Grants and Agreements with Institutions of Higher Education,Hospital, and Other Nonprofit Organizations.'' It is anticipated that projectsreceiving funding under this announcement will begin in the spring of 1990.Reseach funds are normally awarded through a research grant. Applicantsnot familiar with the requirements of a research grant or who need additionalinformation on application requirements are encouraged to contact the applicablereserve manager or MEMD. After final ranking and selection of proposalsby MEMD, a Standard Form 424 must be submitted to MEMD by the PrincipalInvestigator(s) for formal processing of the grant.      <ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Purpose and Priorities</ITAG>Research funds are primarily awarded to support management-related researchthat will enhance scientific understanding of reserve environments, provideinformation needed by reserve managers and coastal zone decisionmakers,and improve public awareness of estuaries an estuarine management issues.Research projects may be oriented to specific reserves; however, projectsthat would benefit more than one reserve in the national system are encouraged.Research proposals submitted in response to this announcement must addresscoastal management issues identified as having regional or national significance,relate those issues to the National Research Priorities described in thisannouncement, and indicate the appropriate reserve. Research projects arenormally funded for one year. Further funding, for up to three years, maybe considered if the applicant wishes to submit proposals for each succeedingyear and clearly demonstrates the benefits of the research to the reserveand the NERRS. Although priority funding consideration will be given toproposals that address the broad categories listed below, all topics willnot be relevant to all reserves in the NERRS. The research topic and thereserve must be carefully chosen to ensure that the resource managementissues of primary concern to the reserve and the NERRS are addressed. Itis thus very important that all prospective proposers contact the appropriatereserve manager before submitting a proposal responding to this announcement.<ITAG tagnum="84">A. National Research Priorities</ITAG>Although large data sets exist for many of the fundamental processes ofestuaries, there are significant gaps in the information needed to understandthe complex functions of most estuaries. To address this issue, some ofthe Nation's most capable estuarine researchers gathered in 1984 for thefirst in a series of national estuarine symposia. Based on the most currentdevelopments in scientific protocol, the researchers recommended researchdirections to enhance our understanding of estuarine processes and functions.This assessment of problematic needs resulted in five categories of researchdirections: water management, sediment management, nutrients and otherchemical inputs, coupling of primary and secondary productivity, and fisheryhabitat requirements. These research topics have been identified as beinga priority to all coastal areas of the United States, including Alaska,Hawaii, the Great Lakes States, Puerto Rico, Guam, and American Samoa.<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Water Management</ITAG>Armstrong (1984) defines water management as using ``whatever means possibleto provide water for beneficial uses.'' The uses and users of water aremany and varied, leading to one of the most important problems currentlyfacing the Nation: allocation of freshwater resources. The increase inthe consumptive use of water by municipal, commercial, industrial, agricultural,and recreational activities competes strongly with the availability ofwater to bays and estuaries. Changing land use practices near estuariesand their upstream tributaries affect the quantity, quality, and timingof freshwater inflow. Since estuaries, by definition, involve the inflowand mixing of fresh and salt water, these variances may cause significantchanges to estuarine productivity. Thus, the relationship between freshwaterinflow and estuarine productivity poses a prime research question (Copeland,1984). However, determining these inflows also depends on our ability tounderstand how they govern the salinity regime, provide nutrients, coupleprimary and secondary productivity, and sustain habitats (Armstrong, 1984).Thus, to answer questions regarding water management, i.e., the allocationof freshwater to estuaries, the following topics are considered to be priorityresearch issues:(a) Determining the basis to establish the amounts of inflows needed toestuaries and the reliability of freshwater inflow estimates;(b) Establishing the functional relationship between nutrient inflows tothe estuary with freshwater inflows and primary and/or secondary productivity;(c) Determining the quantitative relationship between freshwater inflowand fisheries production in specific estuaries and regional groups of estuaries;(d) Delineating the factors that control the response and recovery of estuarinebiological systems to large changes in water input;(e) Establishing the role of coastal upwelling in determining estuarineproductivity; and(f) Preparing nutrient budgets on estuarine systems to clearly elucidatethe roles of freshwater inflows, marshes, benthic systems, coastal waters,precipitation, and other sources, and to delineate the importance of eachsource in providing nutrients and recycling them.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Sediment Management</ITAG>Schubel (1984) states, ``Sediment, particularly fine-grained sediment,has had and continues to have, significant impacts on estuarine productivity.''Estuarine productivity is basically affected by the amount and qualityof the sediments entering the estuary (Copeland, 1984). However, theseprocesses are immensely affected by human activities in the watershedsof estuaries. In addition, long time periods (up to decades and centuries)are required for the movement of sediments into estuaries from drainagebasins of major rivers. Though the sediments may originate from external,internal, or marginal sources, external sediments along rivers are mostinfluenced by human activities. However, the effective management of estuarinesediment problems are limited to two ends of the sedimentation process_atthe source and at the sink (Schubel, 1984). Thus, the effective managementof sediments may depend upon: (1) Reducing sediment inputs through drainagebasins through proper soil conservation practices; (2) reducing contaminantinput through proper source control; and (3) developing and implementingmanagement strategies for sediment deposited in the estuary. On the otherhand, estuary size as well as estuarine processes are varied. Fine sedimentsmay not always be the most pressing problem in smaller estuaries, suchas those found along the West Coast. Sand deposits along costal sand barsand accumulation of materials from the watershed significantly affect manyof these smaller systems (Zedler and Magdych, 1984). In addition, sedimentinput may not necessarily be harmful to any given estuary as sediment deliveryplays an important role in the biological productivity of estuaries (Peterson,1984).The major impediment to research in this area is the impractical and infeasiblenature of critical experiments on the relationship between ecosystems andmajor changes in their environment. For instance, it is impractical andinfeasible to manipulate tidal flushing, flooding, and large-scale additionsor removal of substrates and maintain a control system for comparison.Thus, most of the work conducted to date has been ``before-and-after''studies of major events (Copeland, 1984).  It is therefore apparent that rational biological criteria must be usedto assess the relative merits of alternative sediment management schemes.However, information gaps must be filled before the criteria can be developed.Priority research topics include:  (a) Detailed studies of sediment dynamics to include the effects of sedimentationon flushing and sedimentation rates, accumulation rates and changes insediment composition between points of entry and accumulation, the jointimpacts of reduced freshwater inflow and sediment delivery, the impactsof sediment delivery rates, and shallow water sedimentation processes; (b) The testing and development of biological models that predict the impactsof sedimentation;  (c) Characterization of the processes that control absorption and desorptionof contaminants and other dissolved substances;  (d) Assessing the impacts of sedimentation on benthic and mobile fauna; (e) Determining the relationship of sediment to habitat types;  (f) Identifying the optimal balance between the long-term negative impactsand estuarine filling and the short-term positive stimulation of estuarineproductivity; and  (g) Examining the resilience and recovery rates of ecosystems after large-scalesedimentation events.  <ITAG tagnum="81">3. Nutrients and Other Chemical Inputs  </ITAG>With most of the human population of the United States living around estuariesand other coastal areas, estuaries are experiencing increasing nutrientproblems. It has been projected that by 1990, 75 percent of the UnitedStates' population will live within 50 miles of our Nation's coasts, includingthose of the Great Lakes (Nixon, 1984). There has also been an exponentialincrease in the use of inorganic fertilizers during the last 100 years,contributing to increased nutrient loads. Coupling this with the conversionof wetlands to urban and agricultural use overloads the estuary's abilityto act as a nutrient sink and increases nutrient levels. As a result, scientistshave assumed that the amounts of organic and inorganic nitrogen and phosphoruscarried by streams and rivers into estuaries have also increased markedly.However, as Nixon (1984) points out, the ``lack of adequate long-term datamakes it difficult to know if this is true or to make a quantitative assessmentof the increase loading over time . . .'' It is also noted that nutrientswill continue to be a major human-related input to estuaries and coastalwaters because of the great costs involved in removing inputs, recycling,and production is not well understood.  Little is known about how marine ecosystems respond to nutrient additionsbecause most knowledge of the effects of nutrient additions to the marineecosystem is based on laboratory studies of algal cultures or on short-termexperiments involving nutrient additions to plankton communities (Copeland,1984). However, another concern relates to the effects of chemical inputsinto estuaries and coastal areas. Estimates suggest that 70,000 syntheticchemicals are currently in commercial use, with 1000 new ones synthesizedannually (Malins, et al., 1984). Eventually, many of these chemicals enterestuaries and other environments, thereby altering those ecosystems. However,the effects of these inputs on the estuarine environment, from the benthicenvironment to fish and water quality, are not well understood, althoughevidence indicates that urban-associated estuaries may contain thousandsof anthropogenic chemicals that may cause serious, pollutant-related pathologicalconditions (Malins, et al., 1984). Also, there is little known about theinteractions of fertilizers and pesticides in agriculture.  The estuarine-like areas of the Great Lakes are also an important linkto the fisheries, as they serve as nursery areas for numerous commerciallyimportant species and their prey. They also serve as a trap for many pollutantsthat could adversely impact the Lakes' ecosystems. All five of the GreatLakes are among the fifteen largest lakes in the world and possess approximately95 percent of the surface freshwater in the United States, making the allocationof freshwater and the enhancement of water quality as issues of specialimportance to this area of the United States.  In other words, environmental managers presently base their managementstrategies on mostly provisional data. It is thus important to develop``focused and integrated multidisciplinary research programs * * *'' (Nixon,1984). In addressing management issues related to nutrients and chemicalinputs, priority research may focus on:  (a) Testing the responses of estuarine ecosystems to combinations of nutrientinputs and recycling by developing ecosystem-level experiments involvingmicrocosms, mesocosms, and field manipulations;  (b) Examining the fate of synthetic chemicals in estuaries through thechemical analysis of sediments; the performance of tissue-chemical, grosspathological and histological analyses; evaluation of community structures;conducting controlled laboratory and <T3>in situ</T3> field studies to identify chemicals responsible for field-observedand other toxic effects and determine their relationships; and developingresearch protocols to understand the long-term effects of exotic materialson estuarine ecosystems.  <ITAG tagnum="81">4. Coupling of Primary and Secondary Productivity  </ITAG>Estuarine ecosystems are characterized by high levels of primary and secondaryproduction (Teal, 1962; Marinucci, 1982; Odum, 1984), although their theoreticalrelationship to each other is generally unknown. While there is a theoreticalrelationship between the two, the documentation and relative importanceand ecological effeciencies of the pathways remains unresolved (Odum, 1984).Thus, broadly defined, this coupling includes nearly all food web interactions(Peters and Lewis, 1984).  Food chains in estuarine ecosystems are quantitatively and qualitativelyconnected. However, a clear understanding of the relationship between thequantity of biomass at one producer level and the quantity and qualityof biomass at the next level is lacking. The concept of trophic structuresin estuarine ecosystems is more of a food web than a food chain. In addition,the food web trophic structure found in estuaries is generally abbreviatedcompared to the longer food chains of the ocean and open waters of theGreat Lakes. Understanding the fundamental aspects of this issue is difficultbecause of the likelihood that a change in one trophic level impacts otherportions of the ecosystem by altering the directions or size of energyflow from one component to another.  The lack of documentation on the importance and ecological efficienciesof individual pathways leads to a fundamental management question revolvingaround the protection or improvement of secondary production by managingprimary production (Copeland, 1984). With this concept in mind, many ofthe most important questions relating to estuarine productivity may revolvearound the comparative importance of vascular plant detritus and algaeto estuarine trophic structures (Odum, 1984). Related topics are the degreeto which coastal fisheries organisms utilize detritus as an energy sourceand the impact of removing large tracts of detritus-producing areas suchas swamps, marshes, and seagrass beds.  Thus, the most important research need in this area is the developmentof a quantitative relationship between primary and secondary productionin estuaries. This requires a multidisciplinary approach to delineate thevarious food chains and relationships that exist in estuarine ecosystems.Thus, to address the information needs of estuarine managers and scientists,priority research topics should examine:  (a) The comparative trophic importance of vascular plant versus planktonorganic matter;  (b) The degree to which coastal fishery organisms utilize detritus as anenergy source; and  (c) The impact of removing large tracts of detritus-producing salt marshesand seagrass beds.  These may be accomplished through: (1) The use of multiple isotopes andother techniques to indirectly identify sources of organic carbon for primaryconsumers in estuaries; (2) Studies to determine the chemical composition and nutritional statusof detritus complexes of different age and particle size;  (3) Laboratory feeding experiments to detail the utilization of vascularplant detritus by consumers;  (4) Growth and ecological efficiency studies in large tanks or small pondsto investigate consumer diets;  (5) Controlled field experiments in ponds to determine the feasibilityof detritus aquaculture;  (6) Well-planned ``before and after'' investigations on the local impactof marsh, mangrove, or seagrass removal on fisheries; and  (7) Field investigations and laboratory experiments to investigate thepotential and realized importance of hypothetical reduced-sulfur food webs. <ITAG tagnum="81">5. Estuarine Fishery Habitat Requirements  </ITAG>Many studies have documented the value of estuaries as nursery areas formany commercially and recreationally important fish and shellfish species(e.g., McHugh, 1967; Tyler, 1971; Bayly, 1975; Pollard, 1981; Deegan andDay, 1984). However, some estuaries support larger fish populations thanothers. Three major reasons often proposed for estuarine habitat utilizationby fish are: (1) Food availability; (2) protection from predators; (3)a benign abiotic environment (Joseph, 1973). But understanding the roleof estuarine habitat and quantitative differences in fisheries productionis difficult. Current evidence points to the importance of shallow inshoreestuarine areas to fisheries production (Deegan and Day, 1984). In addition,marshes, seagrass beds, and nearshore shallow areas are particularly importantfish habitat areas. Yet, major questions related to the specifics of therelationships between habitat and fish production are largely unanswered. In order to formulate effective management programs, the most importantquestions revolve around the relationship between estuarine fish productionand the quantity and quality of nursery areas in terms of food availabilityand subsequent growth mortality. A clear understanding of his would beuseful for evaluation, design, and mitigation of activities affecting estuaries.To answer the question of why some estuaries are more productive than others,estuarine scientists need to address questions regarding habitat selection,species migration, species residence time, food quality and quantity, andthe effects of environmental variations on survival, growth, and fish andshellfish movement. Some specific research topics that need to be addressedinclude:  (a) Delineation of the characteristics of a good nursury;  (b) Fishery yield per acre of salt marsh and species-specific relationships; (c) Relationships and mechanisms between fish catch and river discharge,wetland/water ratios, and primary production;  (d) The roles of various sources of primary production and the varianceof these sources between estuaries;  (e) The effects of differing primary production sources on fish production; (f) The relative contribution of different habitat to total stock;  (g) Flow requirements for critical life stages;  (h) Hydrodynamic influences on distribution, abundance, and survival offishery species;  (i) Contaminant impacts on estuarine fields; and  (j) Food as a limiting factor to estuarine fish populations.

Disclosureof this information will not jeopardize chances for Federal funding.(13) <T3>Permits. </T3>The applicant must apply for any applicable state orFederal permits. Attach a copy of the permit application and supportingdocumentation to the proposal as an appendix. MEMD will not release fundinguntil it receives written notification of all required permits.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Submission of Proposals</ITAG>Proposals for research funds under section 315(e)(1)(B) Research Systemare solicitated annually for award the following fiscal year. Proposaldue dates and other pertinent information are contained in the announcementof research opportunities. A list of the appropriate reserve and MEMD contactpersons is attached to the research announcement. All proposals sent toMEMD must include a cover letter that cites and references the <T4>Federal Register </T4>notice in which the announcement appeared. Proposersmust submit an original and two (2) copies of each proposal they submit.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Proposal Review and Evaluation</ITAG>Proposals received by MEMD are acknowledged, forwarded to the appropriatereserve manager, and sent out for national peer review. All proposals arereviewed by the appropriate MEMD personnel including project managers,research coordinator, Chief, reserve managers and their research advisorycommittees, and by usually 3-10 other individuals who are acknowledgedexperts in the particular field represented by the proposal. Proposersare invited to suggest the names of at least 3 individuals who, in theiropinion, are especially well qualified to evaluated the proposal objectively.When a grant a awarded, verbatim copies of the reviews, excluding the namesof reviewers, are mailed, upon request, to the Principal Investigator/ProjectDirector.In order to provide for the fair and equitable selection of the most meritoriousresearch projects for support, MEMD has established criteria for theirreview and evaluation. These criteria are intended to be applied to allresearch proposals in a balanced and judicious manner. The criteria usedin the peer review process to aid MEMD in its final selection of researchprojects are listed below, together with the elements that constitute eachcriterion and the relative weight (in parenthesis):a. <T3>Scientific Merit </T3>(3.0). This is used to determine whether theobjectives of the proposal or of the observations is important to the fieldand to assess the likelihood that research will improve the scientificunderstanding of estuarine processes within the reserve as well as in othersimilar estuaries.b. <T3>Importance to Reserve Management and to Regional Coastal ManagementIssues </T3>(2.0). This is used to determine its importance to managementof the reserve (does its address management issues relevant to the siteand the region?) and its suitability for addressing coastal managementissues of regional and/or national importance.c. <T3>Relevance to National Research Priorities </T3>(2.0). This criterionis used to assess the relationship between the objectives of the proposedproject and the National Research Priorities established by NOAA (see SectionIV.A National Research Priorities).d. <T3>Technical Approach </T3>(3.0). This is used to assess the technicalfeasibility of the proposed project the reasonableness of the hypotheses,the degree to which the proposed timeline is realistic, the appropriatenessand scientific validity of the proposed analytical methods, and the degreeto which the proposal demonstrates an understanding of the reserve environmentand management needs, the current state of knowledge in the particularfield of research interest, and the total research requirements.e. <T3>Qualifications of P.I. and Key Personnel </T3>(2.0). This criterionrelates to the experience and past performance of the principal investigatorand key personnel, their familiarity with the geographic area of the proposedproject, and their publication record.f. <T3>Institutional Support and Capabilities </T3>(1.0). This relates tothe extent of institutional support for and commitment to the proposedresearch and what facilities, equipment, and other resources are availableto the principal investigator and key personnel for use in accomplishingthe proposed work. Because of the 50 percent matching requirement, thisis an especially important consideration.g. <T3>Budget </T3>(1.0). This criterion is used to determine whether thebudget is realistic and reasonable for accomplishing the proposed tasks.<ITAG tagnum="81">4. Reporting Requirements</ITAG>Awards for research are usually made during the second quarter of the fiscalyear. Quarterly performance reports, a draft technical report, and a finaltechnical report are required as conditions of the award.Performance reports should contain a summary of all work performed duringthe preceding quarter and show the overall progress against the milestoneschedule in the approved proposal. A statement of the milestone reached,data compiled, and analyses completed is included. In addition, a summaryof any significant technical, manpower, schedule, or cost problems encounteredduring the preceding quarter, an assessment of their probable impact onthe project's approved milestone schedule, and a statement of any correctiveaction taken or proposed is also required. Also required is a summary ofmajor work activities scheduled for the next quarter and any questionsor problems regarding the applicant's work that requires discussion withor resolution by MEMD.The draft and final technical reports are required to be prepared followingMEMD's ``Guidelines for Preparing Technical Reports on Research in NationalEstuarine Research Reserves'' which is appended to the award, but is alsoavailable upon request.<ITAG tagnum="81">5. Further Information</ITAG>For further information on research opportunities under the National EstuarineReserve Research System, contact the on-site personnel listed in this textor the Marine and Estuarine Management Division, Office of Ocean and CoastalResource Management, 1825 Connecticut Avenue, NW., Suite 714, Washington,DC 20235 (202) 673-5126.C. General RequirementsGrants for Federal financial assistance are subject to certain generalrequirements, such as compliance with the Civil Rights Act of 1964, TitleIX of the Education Amendments of 1972, and other laws and regulationsprohibiting discrimination; patent and copyright requirements; cost sharing;the use of U.S. flag carriers for international travel; and the use offoreign currency as appropriate to accomplish the objectives of a project.The requirements of Executive Order 12372, ``Intergovernmental Review ofFederal Programs,'' are applicable to the award of grants under this notice.However, the requirements of the Executive Order apply to individuals onlyif a state or local government is the provider of the Non-Federal funds.Applicants are also subject to the requirements of 15 CFR Part 26, ``GovernmentwideDebarment and Suspension (Nonprocurement) and Governmentwide Requirementsfor Drug-Free Workplace (Grants).''D. Adherence to Original ObjectivesThe Principal Investigator should feel free to pursue important leads thatmay arise during the conduct of the project. MEMD support will not be jeopardizedif the Principal Investigator discontinues or materially modifies the originallyplanned line of inquiry in favor of one that appears to have more promise.MEMD must, however, give prior written approval when a modification wouldresult in a major deviation from the original objective(s) or project scope,including activities specifically excluded from support when the awardwas made.E. Adherence to Original Budget EstimatesThe grant award includes or refers to a budget that lists the items forwhich funds are provided. All budget transfers are subject to the provisionsof 15 CFR Part 24 and OMB Circular A-110, as appropriate. While the PrincipalInvestigator has reasonable flexibility to alter direction of the projectwhen changes seem advantageous, the grantee organization must considerthe effect of any budget reallocations on the indirect cost portions ofthe budget, and must observe the conditions prescribed by the award. Anychange in the budget that will affect the match portion of the award mustbe approved in writing by MEMD. When any budget change requires MEMD approval,two copies of the request, signed by the Principal Investigator and bythe grantee organization's authorized official, should be sent to the assignedMEMD Contracting Officer's Technical Representative. The request shouldclearly state which budget items are to be changed and by what amountsand should explain the reasons for the change.F. Changes in PersonnelWritten MEMD approval is required for any permanent change in PrincipalInvestigator(s) or project director(s) or for any temporary change in excessof three (3) months, such as an investigator taking sabbatical leave. Further,MEMD must be informed when it appears that a Principal Investigator willdevote substantially more or less effort to the work than anticipated inthe approval proposal. Written prior approval is also required for anychange in senior personnel specifically named in the proposal and for theaddition of senior personnel not named in the proposal.G. Transfer of Principal InvestigatorWhen a Principal Investigator plans to leave an institution during thecourse of an award, the institution has the prerogative to nominate a substitutePI or request that the award be terminated and closed out. Substitute PIsare subject to written MEMD approval. In those cases where a particularPI's participation is integral to a given project and the PI's originaland new institution agree, MEMD will request a transfer of the grant andthe assignment of remaining unobligated funds to the PI's new institution.H. SubcontractsSubcontracts that become necessary after a grant has been made must besubmitted to MEMD for approval. The proposed performance statement andbudget, a statement indicated the basis for selection of the contractor,and a justification of the proposed arrangement must be provided.I. Suspension or Termination of GrantsMEMD grants may be suspended or terminated in accordance with the procedurescontained in the General Grant Conditions. Grants may also be terminatedby mutual agreement. Termination by mutual agreement shall not affect anycommitment or grant funds that, in the judgment of MEMD and the grantee,had become firm before the effective date of the termination.J. Proposals As Public RecordA proposal that results in a MEMD grant becomes part of the record of thetransaction and will be available to the public, upon written request,except as described below. Information or material that MEMD and the granteemutually agree to be of privileged nature will be held in confidence tothe extent permitted by the freedom of Information Act and other relevantlaws. Without assuming any liability for inadvertent disclosure, MEMD willseek to limit dissemination of such information to its personnel and, whennecessary for evaluation of the proposal, to outside reviewers. Accordingly,any privileged information should be in a separate, accompanying statementbearing a legend such as: ``The following is (proprietary) (specify) informationthat (name of proposing organization) requests not to be released to personsoutside the Government, except for purposes of evaluation.'' Appropriatelabeling in the proposal aids identification of what under law may be specificallywithheld from disclosure.A proposal that does not result in a MEMD grant will be retained by MEMDbut will be released to the public only with the consent of the proposeror to the extent required by the law. Portions of proposals resulting inawards that contain descriptions of inventions in which either the Governmentor the grantee owns or may own a right, title, or interest (including anonexclusive license) will not normally be made available to the publicuntil after reasonable time has been allowed for filing patent application.It is the policy of MEMD to notify the grantee of receipt of requests forcopies of funded proposals so that the grantee may advise MEMD of suchinventions described in the proposal.K. Inventions and Copyrightable MaterialsEach MEMD grant in support of research may be subject to a patent rightsclause. Normally, grantees may elect to retain principal rights to theiremployees' inventions, subject to the conditions set forth in the U.S.Department of Commerce's final rule published on March 18, 1987 entitled``Rights to Inventions made by Nonprofit Organizations and Small BusinessFirms (37 CFR Part 401). Each MEMD grant may be subject to several conditionsaffecting copyrightable material (reports, publications, software, etc.)produced in the performance of work under the grant. Normally, granteesmay own or permit others to own most rights to such material, with theGovernment receiving the right to use the material for Government purposes.MEMD encourages dissemination, especially through publication in refereedjournals and similar media of research performed under its grants. MEMDmay arrange for the publication of outstanding MEMD-funded research projectsin its NOAA Technical Memorandum Series and disseminate through the NationalTechnical Information Service (NTIS) of the U.S. Department of Commerce.<ITAG tagnum="21">Date: April 4, 1989</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Thomas J.
