Researchers at Cornell University in Ithaca, N.Y., reported that they found asbestos in treated municipal sewage, a common ingredient in some fertilizers. Donald Lisk, professor of toxicology and plant science at the university, said Monday that the group's findings raise safety questions about using treated municipal sludge as fertilizer.    Mr. Lisk said that while the Environmental Protection Agency prohibits use of sludge fertilizer if it contains dangerous concentrations of such carcinogenic materials as copper, zinc, arsenic, mercury, nickel, lead or PCBs, the EPA regulations don't cover asbestos in fertilizer.    A spokesman for the EPA, which recently gave out awards for the creative use of sewage sludge, said it isn't considering any regulation at this time.    Mr. Lisk said Cornell scientists tested sludge from 15 different New York communities and from five other cities -- Baltimore, Cincinnati, Dallas, Los Angeles and Philadelphia. He said the group found that the amount of asbestos in sludge ranged from trace amounts to 1% of total weight, &quot;which is quite large.&quot; He said about 25% of the sludge, a powdery residue from waste water treated in municipal treatment plants, is used as a soil-conditioning fertilizer for farmlands, golf courses and greenhouses. The rest is put in landfills or dumped in the ocean.    The researchers concluded that asbestos survives current sewage treatments. &quot;We found actual fibers,&quot; not only fine particles, in the treated sludge, Mr. Lisk said. On the other hand, he said, ash from incinerated sewage didn't contain asbestos. He said incinerator temperatures of as much as 1,000 degrees Celsius are enough to destroy the mineral. Currently, only 27% of sewage is incinerated.    &quot;We recommend incineration of sludge rather than any of the other disposal methods,&quot; Mr. Lisk said.    The researchers aren't sure how asbestos is ending up in the sewage. The material, once widely used for insulating and fireproofing, is being removed from residential and commercial buildings because it was found to cause lung cancer. Mr. Lisk said that some sewer pipes are made of asbestos and cement, and that acidic sewage is loosening the asbestos into free fibers. He doubted, however, that this would account for &quot;the large proportion of asbestos&quot; in the sludge.    He said the presence of asbestos in fertilizer poses dangers to human and animal health. He said greenhouse workers using soils with sludge fertilizer could inhale asbestos, as could golfers and cattle eating grass from sludge-fertilized land. </TEXT></DOC>
