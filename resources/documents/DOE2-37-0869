The SLB-type lead acid battery,manufactured by Japan Storage Battery Co., Ltd., is of the single-celltype or group-cell type for the discharge of both high and ultralow currents.This battery thus matches a wide range of applications in photovoltaicpower generation from short-time charge/discharge during sunny hoursand medium-time charge/discharge during the daytime and nighttime orsunny or rainy days to long-term charge/discharge over the seasons. Thispaper describes the discharge characteristics, charge characteristics,and service life characteristics of this battery, together with measuringequipment currently in practical use to properly maintain lead acid batteries.Photovoltaic power generation is highly evaluated as a power source forremote, mountainous regions. Many of the photovoltaic power generationsystems use a storage battery. In this case, a great importance is placedon a system to connect storage batteries and loads. (8 figs, 2 tabs)</TEXT></DOC>
