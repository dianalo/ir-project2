The Ministry of International Trade and Industry said DaikinIndustries, an Osaka-based air conditioner manufacturer, and TokyoBoeki, a small trading house, exported 860 tons of high-densityhalogenated hydrocarbon to the Soviet Union in 1986 and 1987 withoutministry permission.   Exporting such a solution in concentrated form to the SovietUnion or other communist nations is prohibited under Japanese exportcontrol laws and international agreements among Western members ofthe Coordinating Committee on Multilateral Export Control, or COCOM.   COCOM is an international watchdog body regulating the flow ofhigh technology products from Western nations to the communist bloc.The body, however, does not directly intervene in members' tradepractices nor impose penalities against violators.   In an earlier case, Toshiba Machine Co. was accused of sellingsophisticated milling equipment to the Soviet Union in 1986, also inviolation of COCOM regulations.   The Toshiba incident led to tough criticism from the UnitedStates, which claimed the equipment helped the Soviets buildquieter, harder to detect submarines. Washington later slappedsevere sanctions on Toshiba Machine and prohibited the company fromexporting to the United States for three years, beginning in 1988.   In the wake of the Toshiba Machine incident in 1986, the tradeministry strengthened its export control sections. Last year, thetrade ministry implicated three traders for illegally exportinghigh-tech digital equipment to China.   The Osaka Prefectural Police, notified by the trade ministry,searched Daikin and Tokyo Boeki offices Wednesday morning.   The ministry filed charges with Osaka police against the companyfor violating the Foreign Exchange Law by exporting the chemical,known as Halon-2402, with a purity of more than 99.8 percent bydeclaring it to be of lower purity.   Daikin executive Noriyuki Inoue said at a hastily called newsconference that the company did not deliberately export any illegalproducts.   ``It was the result of our deficient management, and we promisewe will never repeat the same mistake,'' he said.   Halon-2402 is 99.95 percent pure when it is produced, and it hadto be diluted with other chemicals to meet COCOM regulations, hesaid.   Daikin, which had been exporting Halon-2402 to the Soviet Unionfor use in fire extinguishers on fishing boats since 1979, said ithas exported about 900 tons of Halon-2402 for about $3.28 million in1986-87 through Tokyo Boeki.   Daikin stopped exporting the chemical in August, when it foundthe product violated COCOM regulations, the Daikin official said. Hesaid Daikin would discontinue producing Halon-2402.   Analysts said the trade ministry's action indicated itsdetermination to strictly clamp down on illegal exports of sensitivegoods to the communist nation.   ``I take it as something like a hello call to President-electBush,'' said Kazuhisa Ogawa, a defense analyst and noted author onU.S.-Japan military relations.   Halogenated hydrocarbon is a fluoric compound, commonly used infire extinguishers. But it can also be used as a coolant for guidedmissiles, Ogawa said.   Ogawa said the timing of the trade ministry's action, ahead of avisit by Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze, stressesJapan's loyalty to the United States. Shevardnadze is scheduled tovisit Tokyo on Dec. 19 for talks with Prime Minister NoboruTakeshita and Foreign Minister Sousuke Uno.</TEXT></DOC>
