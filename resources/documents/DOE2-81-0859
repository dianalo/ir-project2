In studyingcorrosion characteristics of implanted metals a strong dependence ofchemical passivation effect on technological conditions of ion-implantationand structure of initial material is stated. On the basis of developedmathematical model of chemical passivation effect it is shown that increaseof corrosion characteristics of implanted metals is defined by superpositionof surface and volumetric mechanisms.</TEXT></DOC>
