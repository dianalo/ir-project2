A report by the Democratic staff of the House Energy and Commercetelecommunications subcommittee says the FCC's proposal fails toassure that rates for regulated phone service will be ``just andreasonable,'' as required by the Communications Act.   The FCC has proposed to change the way it regulates AmericanTelephone andamp; Telegraph Co. and the regional Bell phone companies bylifting limits on the profits they can earn and instead set aceiling on rates. The price cap would limit rate increases to threepercentage points less than annual inflation.   The agency estimated the plan, which would be optional for thephone companies, could save consumers $1.6 billion over four yearsif all the companies participated. Long-distance bills would beabout one-half of a percentage point lower annually than they wouldbe under traditional profit regulation, the FCC said.   But the report by the staff of the panel headed by Rep. Edward J.Markey, D-Mass., said Congress intended that rate regulation of``dominant carriers'' _ phone companies controlling major portionsof the business in a market _ be based on the costs of providingservice.   ``As currently structured, the price cap scheme will permitcarriers to set prices that may deviate significantly from costs,''the report said. ``There is no assurance that rates would remaineven within a `zone' of reasonableness.''   FCC spokesman John Kamp said the commission had not received thereport, but ``the question of the commission's authority to move toa price-cap plan has been explored in detail throughout thisproceeding and we have concluded to date that there is no legalimpediment to commission action.'' He added: ``We will considercarefully any new legal issues contained in this report.''   FCC Chairman Dennis R. Patrick, who has long wanted to loosentelephone regulation with a system of price caps, has been pushingfor a final vote on the plan at the commission's Dec. 2 meeting,despite strong indications from Democrats on Capitol Hill thataction taken before Congress returns would intensify the badrelations between the FCC and lawmakers.   ``I will not rush this issue to judgment, but I also won't delayit beyond the time at which it's ripe for decision,'' Patrick saidlast week.   Patrick, who left earlier this week to spend the Thanksgivingholiday in California, could not be reached for comment on thereport or whether he would put the price-cap issue on thecommission's Dec. 2 agenda. Commission sources said a decision wouldbe made Friday, when the FCC must announce the items that will be onthat agenda.   Sources close to Patrick say he is not wedded to considering aprice-cap proposal at the Dec. 2 meeting and would be content to putit off until January. He said last week, however, ``It's something Iwant considered in my lifetime ... at the commission.''   Though he is not expected to leave immediately, many doubt thatPatrick will remain as FCC chairman for more than the first fewmonths of the Bush administration. They speculate that Bush willwant a new FCC chairman to repair the agency's tattered relationswith Congress.   The biggest problem for Patrick right now is getting a secondvote for his proposal. With two vacancies on the commission, he sitson the panel with two Democrats, and both have indicated concernsabout the plan.</TEXT></DOC>
