Jacobs, who has indicated he's prepared topersevere to gain control of the cosmetics maker.   As the board holds a regular meeting today at Avon'sheadquarters here, members are expected to renew their resolve tokeep the company on its current course.   Jacobs' bid represents the third unsolicited offer for Avon thisyear.   James E. Preston, Avon's chairman and chief executive, issued abrief news release Wednesday in which he revealed Jacobs' requestfor a meeting to negotiate a possible purchase of Avon, the world'sbiggest direct sales company.   Preston said the request would be reviewed at the board'smeeting and that he had sent a letter to Jacobs informing him thatin the past, board members stressed that Avon is not for sale.   Jacobs, who oversees his investment empire from Minneapolis,said in a telephone interview Wednesday that he's never been in abetter position to carry out an acquisition attempt and indicatedhe would be tenacious in his quest for Avon.   ``We've had the best year we've ever had,'' Jacobs said. ``Allthese things play a part. I have never been more serious about acommitment in my life.''   In three separate deals in the past year, Jacobs and investmentpartners reported making more than $164 million.   Jacobs' offer for Avon is worth about $2.25 billion based on54.91 million shares of common stock outstanding. Jacobs also saidin a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that hecontemplates redeeming Avon's preferred shares, which would cost$33.50 per share, or a total of about $603 million, raising theprice tag on Avon to roughly $2.85 billion.   In composite New York Stock Exchange trading Wednesday, Avonstock jumped $1 to $36.50 a share on word of Jacobs' proposal.   But investors may have refrained from bidding Avon sharplyhigher due to past disappointments. The company has slammed thedoor on at least two suitors in recent months.   In May, the Avon board rejected a hostile $39-a-share bid fromrival direct selling company Amway Corp. and indicated that itwould resist future acquisition attempts.   Only days later, Mary Kay Corp., parent of door-to-door makeupseller Mary Kay Cosmetics Inc., disclosed its interest in acquiringAvon but also got a cold shoulder.   Although Amway withdrew its bid of about $2.1 billion, thecompany still has a stake in Avon.   Through a partnership with Jacobs, Amway has an interest inabout 10.3 percent of Avon's common stock outstanding. Jacobscontrols about 55 percent of the Avon stock owned by A-JPartnership, as the alliance of Amway and Jacobs is called.   The partnership didn't act jointly in making the initial bid forAvon and Jacobs said they are not acting together now.   If he prevails in his takeover attempt, Jacobs said, he wouldkeep Avon's core direct-selling business in the United States andretain a significant interest in the company's internationaldivision.   There are about 475,000 Avon sales representatives operating inthe United States and 1 million selling Avon cosmetics, toiletriesand jewelry in foreign markets.   Jacobs said if he gets control of Avon he would sell Avon'sretail division, which consists of some of the country'sbest-selling perfumes sold at department store counters, includingGiorgio Beverly Hills and Red.   He also would finish divesting the health care businesses thatAvon has been selling.   The divestitures have been part of Avon's strategy to enhanceprofitability. In the second quarter, Avon earned $39.5 million onsales of $778 million compared with a loss of $82.5 million andsales of $704 million a year earlier.   Jacobs said he had no intention of selling any piece of Avon toAmway or to Mary Kay. He said he has not had any contact with Avonexecutives except a telephone call to acknowledge receipt of hisletter.   Jacobs said he has hired an investment banking arm of Citicorpto help him arrange financing for the all-cash offer for Avon.</TEXT></DOC>
