Taiheiyo coal was studied in tetralin solvent at conditionsof 400C, 30 minutes and nitrogen pressure (initial pressure of 40kg/cm{sup2}). 2,6-Di-t-butyl-phenol(2-6Bu{sub 2}t) which has especially largebonding energies to radicals and other hydroxy aromatic compounds wereused as additives. Additives which have low OH bonding energies or highhydrogen bonding energies between additives and ether in coal, were moreeffective. Radical bonding effect on 2-6-Bu{sub 2}t solvation effecton phenols and both radical bonding and solvation effects on o-cresolworked well. Guaiacol addition increased the solvent refining coal yield.2-6-Bu{sub 2}t had large radical bonding effect and gave better resultalso to storage stability of coal liquid.
