Bishop (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><DATELINE> NEW YORK  </DATELINE><TEXT>   A mysterious upsurge in narcotic-related deaths here may result from unrecognized effects of the AIDS virus, public health researchers reported.    The researchers said that since the AIDS epidemic broke out in 1982, the number of narcotics-related deaths here has skyrocketed an average of 32% a year, even though the number of drug addicts hasn't changed appreciably. A large portion of these deaths resulted from pneumonia, heart infections, tuberculosis and other causes that heretofore haven't been classified as related to AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome.    There are various indications that many of these &quot;non-AIDS&quot; deaths among drug addicts may have been the indirect result of an undiagnosed infection by the virus that causes AIDS, a team of government and university health researchers led by the New York City Department of Health reported in this week's issue of Science.    If that is true, they added, the total number of AIDS-related deaths in the city is actually 50% higher than is being officially reported, with most of the unrecognized cases occurring among drug addicts, many of whom are black and Hispanic.    Until the AIDS epidemic broke out among homosexual men and intravenous narcotics users, the number of narcotics-related deaths in New York averaged 488 a year, the researchers noted. In the wake of the AIDS epidemic, the number began climbing, reaching almost 2,000 deaths in 1986. However, only slightly less than half of these narcotics-related deaths were classified as involving AIDS, they said. The net result was that the non-AIDS death rate among drug addicts doubled by 1986.    This doubling of non-AIDS deaths among addicts occurred although &quot;the estimated population of intravenous drug users in New York City is believed to have remained stable during the period of the AIDS epidemic,&quot; the researchers said. Moreover, improved recognition and diagnosis of narcotics-related deaths couldn't account &quot;for an increase of this magnitude,&quot; they added.    A rechecking of death certificates, autopsy reports and hospital medical records showed that a large number of these non-AIDS deaths among drug addicts resulted from infections of the lungs, heart and blood, as well as from drug overdoses.    The AIDS virus, which is spread by the sharing of contaminated needles among drug addicts, wreaks its havoc by suppressing the immune system and leaving its victims mortally vulnerable to infections that are normally warded off by healthy persons. The diagnosis of AIDS, however, is restricted only to certain types of infections. The most common cause of death in AIDS patients, for example, is a pneumonia caused by a microbe known as pneumocystis carinii, which rarely afflicts healthy persons.    The bacteria causing the lung, heart and blood infections seen in the dead addicts were either unknown or weren't types ordinarily linked to AIDS. But, the researchers speculated, immune suppression caused by the AIDS virus could account for the fatal results of the bacterial infections. The rechecking indicated that 46% of the non-AIDS deaths were &quot;consistent with&quot; infection by the AIDS virus or a suppression of the immune system. They suggested the definition of AIDS may have to be expanded. </TEXT></DOC>
