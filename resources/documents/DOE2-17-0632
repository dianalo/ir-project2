New timing data obtained from measurementsof the 67-min cycle indicate that its period continues to decrease secularly.Interpreting this in the context of the intermediate polar model yieldsa probable mass accretion rate in the range 10-?/sup 11/ - 10/sup -10/solar mass yr/sup -1/. The orbital period has decreased over the interval1981-86 but the long-term trend is consistent with a sinusoidal variationnoted in earlier studies. This trend most probably reflects complex angularmomentum transfer mechanisms in addition to gravitational radiation andspin-orbit coupling.</TEXT></DOC>
