Zlatko Glamuzina, chief dealer at the New York office of Banco diSicilia, said the fact that other big U.S. banks didn't trim theirprime a half percentage point to 10.5 percent, as Chase did onMonday, indicated that interest rates weren't falling as rapidly aspreviously thought.   Economists said many banks probably were awaiting further signsthat the Federal Reserve was loosening credit policies in reactionto an economic slowdown before they lowered their prime.   ``The Fed seems to be easing (credit) extremely cautiously,''Glamuzina said.
