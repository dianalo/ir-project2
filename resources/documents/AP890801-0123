Administrations back to President Nixon's for the most part haveshied away from military retaliation when faced with terroristactivity, even when the provocation was great. Now Bush is the onefacing decisions after Monday's reported execution of Lt. Col.William Higgins.   A 1986 report on terrorism written by a task force headed bythen Vice President Bush summed up the difficulty: ``Our principlesof justice will not permit random retaliation against groups orcountries.''   The report also acknowledged that counter-terrorism operationsare high risk missions that ``can have a severe negative impact onU.S. prestige if they fail.''   Put another way, Bush is loath to order the dropping of500-pound bombs if, in addition to doing away with enemy targets,the action also claims the lives of innocent civilians andjeopardizes the remaining American hostages as well. Americanstraveling in the Middle East could become even more invitingtargets to terrorists intent on vengeance.   Compounding Bush's problem is that solid intelligence fromBeirut's shadowy underworld is hard to come by. The Americanhostages are believed to be never in the same place at the sametime so a rescue mission is regarded as extremely difficult if notfutile.   The administration has begun pursuing a diplomatic option fordealing with the terrorism issue but officials acknowledged Tuesdaythat this is a painstakingly slow process with little prospect ofquick results.   After conferring in Paris in recent days with Secretary of StateJames A. Baker III, Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze wasin Tehran Tuesday relaying American concerns about the unfoldingdrama in Beirut, according to the officials.   Beyond that, U.S. diplomats were in contact with a number ofgovernments thought to be in a position to influence the Iranians,who have close links to the Lebanese Shiite group which claimedresponsibility for Higgins' reported death.   Bush's decision to cut short his out of town schedule on Mondayand return to Washington raised the expectation that more dramaticmeasures were in the offing to register his horror over Monday'sdevelopments.   On the other hand, the almost unanimous opinion of privateexperts is that Bush's hands are tied.   ``Rhetoric is cheap, but decisive action is difficult. I don'tknow if there is very much we can do in the short term,'' saidGeoffrey Kemp, a former Reagan administration official who worksfor the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.   There are other inhibitions to a strong show of U.S. force. Inthe post-Khomeini era in Tehran, a bloody retaliatory raid couldsquander whatever prospects there are for an improvement inrelations with Iran.   The sense of anxiety here has been heightened with the threatthat another American hostage, Joseph Cicippio, will be killedThursday if Israel does not release a kidnapped Shiite cleric.   No president was more disposed toward dealing decisively withterrorists than Ronald Reagan, who took office pledging ``swift andeffective retribution'' against them.   But Reagan stopped short of carrying out that promise even inthe face of his darkest moment as president: the truck bombingdeaths of 241 American Marines in Beirut in October 1983.   Public demands for retaliatory action quickly dissipated whenAmerican attention was diverted by the U.S.-led invasion of Grenadabarely two days later.   In addition, Reagan felt that the options presented to him forretaliating for the deaths of the Marines were too costly.   Reagan did respond with a determined show of force 2{ yearslater after he concluded that Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi wasbehind the bombing of a cafe in West Germany frequented by Americansoldiers.   American F-111 bombers based in Britain struck at targets inTripoli and Benghazi, and administration officials said Gadhafi wasfar less adventuresome afterward.   While the link between Gadhafi and the cafe bombing appeared tobe clear, at least to the administration, the connection betweenIran and the Shiite Moslem group which announced the execution ofHiggins on Monday was more ambiguous.</TEXT><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE><TEXT>   George Gedda has covered foreign affairs for theAssociated Press since 1968.</TEXT></DOC>
