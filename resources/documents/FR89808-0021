The density of traffic and the type of operations being conducted in theairspace surrounding major terminals increase the probability of midaircollisions. In 1970, an extensive study found that the majority of midaircollisions occurred between a general aviation (GA) aircraft and an aircarrier, military or another GA aircraft. The basic causal factor commonto these conflicts was the mix of uncontrolled aircraft operating underVFR and controlled aircraft operating under instrument flight rules (IFR).TCA's provide a method to accommodate the increasing number of IFR andVFR operations. The regulatory requirements of TCA airspace afford thegreatest protection for the greatest number of people by providing ATCwith an increased capability to provide aircraft separation service, therebyminimizing the mix of controlled and uncontrolled aircraft. On August 22, 1987, the Secretary of Transportation announced nine locationsfor which the FAA would issue Notices proposing the establishment of TCA's.The nine candidates cited qualify for TCA status by meeting the criteriapublished in FAA Handbook 7400.2C, ``Procedures for Handling Airspace Matters.''The criteria for establishing a TCA are based on factors which includethe number of aircraft and people using that airspace, the traffic density,and the type or nature of operations being conducted. Accordingly, guidelineshave been established to identify TCA locations based on two elements_thenumber of enplaned passengers and the number of aircraft operations. To date, the FAA has established a total of 23 TCA's. The FAA is proposingto take action to modify or implement the application of these proven controltechniques to more airports to provide greater protection of air trafficin the airspace regions most commonly used by passenger-carrying aircraft.<ITAG tagnum="84">User Group Participation </ITAG>The TCA adopted by this amendment is the product of discussion with a broadrepresentation of the aviation community. In conjunction with this action,the FAA will continue to work cooperatively with local user groups to ensurethat the TCA is effective for all users by identifying any adjustmentsor modifications that appear necessary. Through joint FAA and user cooperation,any problems that arise can then be identified and corrective action takenwhen necessary.The TCA configuration adopted here has been developed through substantialpublic participation. Initially, informal airspace meetings were held onJuly 12 and 13, 1988, to allow local aviation interests and airspace usersan opportunity to present input on the design of the proposed CharlotteTCA. Subsequently, a TCA Ad Hoc Committee was formed comprising a crosssection of the aviation community with technical assistance and supportsupplied by Charlotte Tower personnel. After those initial meetings andafter extensive coordination with the TCA Ad Hoc Committee, a tentativeTCA configuration was prepared for public discussion. As a result of thoseefforts, further adjustments to the TCA configuration were made and werereflected in the FAA's modified configuration proposed formally for adoption.An additional opportunity for public participation was provided by a Noticeof Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on May 8, 1989 (54 FR 19860). Comments were receivedin response to the Notice. Due consideration has been given to these commentsas well as the comments received at the various meetings. <ITAG tagnum="84">Discussion of Comments </ITAG>In response to the TCA proposal, the FAA received eleven written commentsfrom individuals, pilots and owners of aircraft, local government agencies,and aviation trade and industry associations. In addition, the FAA hashad the benefit of considerable dialog at user group meetings. The FAAappreciates the thoughtful and meaningful contributions and the interestexpressed by all of those who took time to participate in the several stepsof this rulemaking proceeding. Following is an analysis of the commentsreceived. Several commenters, in lieu of the TCA, were supportive of the climb anddescent corridor concept which would keep jets in a narrow area and athigh altitudes until necessary to descend. They cited, ``it would enableall pilots (private and commercial) to know exactly where the incomingand outgoing passenger jet aircraft would be located and would focus ourattention in these four pathways.'' The primary concern in any proposedTCA action is providing the highest degree of safety while preserving themost efficient use of the available terminal airspace. A simulated testof the climb/descent corridor concept was conducted in the Boston, MA,area. One TCA and three corridor configurations were tested. It was concludedthat, while corridors do provide a degree of safety to aircraft arrivingand departing terminal areas, they do not provide adequate and/or sufficientairspace required to effectively vector, sequence, and meter the vast numbersof aircraft served in major terminal areas today. The use of corridorswould result in a drop in the capacity for most terminal areas becauseof the different performance characteristics of aircraft. Other commenters were critical of the Mode C veil (that airspace within30 miles of a primary TCA airport, as established in 53 FR 23356, June21, 1988) which would be established concurrent with the TCA. The ModeC rule requires pilots to have and operate a transponder with Mode C intheir aircraft when operating within 30 miles of any designated TCA primaryairport (commonly called Mode C veil) from the surface to 10,000 feet MSL.The advantages of transponder with Mode C are: (1) To provide automaticconflict alert and low-altitude alert warnings to controllers, which canbe quickly relayed to the pilot; (2) to provide the controllers with acontinuous, more complete traffic picture; (3) to reduce radio communications;and (4) to assist aircraft being controlled by ATC to avoid aircraft operatingwithout ATC assistance. One commenter opposed the TCA because it did not include a buffer area.1,200 feet above ground level (AGL) and 15 miles from the primary airportto the end of the Mode C veil, for instance, which would allow recreationaland business aircraft which are not equipped with Mode C equipment to flyto feeder airports. The floor of the TCA from 11 miles to 20 miles fromthe primary airport is 3,600 feet MSL; this area has the greater concentrationof satellite airports. This is more than adequate to allow VFR ingress/egressto satellite airports within the Charlotte terminal area. However, aircraftin these areas are required to comply with the Mode C transponder rule.One commenter felt the proposal was acceptable, but suggested the use oflong range navigation (LORAN) as a substitute for VOR or TACAN in the TCA.LORAN was originally developed for marine use and is presently being usedfor <T3>supplemental </T3>air navigation, primarily because of its low acquisitioncost and area navigation coverage down to the surface. LORAN C is intendedas an interim supplemental radio navigation system for aviation use providingat least single-level coverage for en route and terminal IFR navigationfor the contiguous United States. The use of LORAN C does not offer thesame navigational coverage throughout the United States as the presentsystem. Several commenters suggested Charlotte/Douglas International Airport doesnot have the volume of traffic to warrant a TCA. Although the criteriafor establishing a TCA include the number of aircraft, it is also basedon factors which include the people using that airspace, the traffic density,and the type or nature of operations being conducted. The annual enplanedpassengers at Charlotte/Douglas International Airport almost double the3.5 million necessary for consideration as a TCA candidate. Additionally,within the proposed boundaries, more than 700,000 flight operations areconducted annually. The Gastonia Airport Authority (GAA) suggested postponing the TCA untila Remote Communication Outlet (RCO) could be installed at Gastonia Airport.The RCO would allow departing pilots to request and receive departure instructionswhile on the ground in their aircraft. The GAA suggests without the useof an RCO, aircraft arriving and departing Gastonia would be restrictedto using the corridor to the west. The FAA agrees that the installationof an RCO would be beneficial to the operation at Gastonia Airport andwill support the GAA's effort to install and operate this equipment. However,until this equipment is installed and operational, pilots can use a dedicatedtelephone hookup located at Gastonia Airport. This telephone line is adirect communication link provided between the Gastonia Airport and theCharlotte Approach Control. As this telephone line is used by pilots atGastonia to obtain IFR clearance from Charlotte Approach Control, it canalso be used to obtain TCA instructions before departure.The Air Line Pilots Association (ALPA) suggested lowering the floor ofArea C and D of the proposed TCA to 6,000 feet MSL and adding a 25- to30-mile ring to include 8,000 to 10,000 feet. ALPA suggested this airspacewas necessary to insure B-727 jet aircraft containment in the TCA duringhot summer days. Conversely, The Soaring Society of America (SSA) suggestedthe elimination of Area D and all of Area C not aligned with Area E, thearrival descent corridors. Data developed by a local airline using itsB-727 flight simulator indicated the necessity for the 20- to 25-mile ringto contain B-727 departures during hot weather. Additionally, data suppliedby Charlotte Tower also indicates a need for this airspace to allow adequateairspace for departures and inbound mixing of aircraft. The SSA also suggested that a cutout was not provided for Chester Airportas recommended by the TCA AD HOC committee. Although the Chester Airportwas excluded from the TCA lateral boundaries, additional airspace willbe provided for soaring activities in the vicinity of Chester Airport undera Letter of Agreement between Charlotte Tower and the Bermuda High SoaringSchool. One commenter stated that Charlotte did not need a TCA with a 30-mile radius.It is the FAA policy to use only that airspace necessary to accomplishthe objective of the TCA. The airspace configuration about the CharlotteTCA extends to 30 miles only in four critical arrival descent corridors.This airspace is necessary to allow for safe transition from the en routeto the terminal environment while allowing adequate room for VFR operations.One commenter suggested in lieu of a TCA, the airport trust fund shouldbe used to build or invest in satellite airports close to the metropolitanarea that can be used by all. There are plans for a new Gastonia Airportwith improved facilities for GA, as well as, plans for a new reliever airportfor Cabasas County, east of Charlotte, to accommodate GA in that area.Federal funds have already been used to make improvements in the Rock Hilland Monroe Airports, south and southeast of Charlotte. <ITAG tagnum="84">The Rule </ITAG>This amendment to Part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations designatesa Terminal Control Area (TCA) at the Charlotte/Douglas International Airport,NC, using NAVAID radials and distances where practical to accommodate currenttraffic flows and provide a greater degree of safety in known areas ofcongestion involving controlled IFR and uncontrolled VFR flights. Consequently,the FAA has determined that establishment of a TCA at Charlotte/DouglasInternational Airport is in the interest of flight safety and will resultin a greater degree of protection for the greatest number of people duringflight in that terminal area. Charlotte/Douglas International Airport iscurrently served by an ARSA which is rescinded with the establishment ofthis TCA. <ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Evaluation Summary </ITAG>The FAA is required to assess the benefits and costs of each proposed rulemakingaction to assure that the public is not burdened with rules whose costsoutweigh their benefits. This section contains an analysis which quantifies,to the maximum possible extent, the costs and benefits of establishinga TCA at Charlotte, NC. This final rule is intended to lower the likelihood of midair collisionsby increasing the capability of the ATC system to separate all aircraftin terminal airspace around the Charlotte/Douglas International Airport.This action was prompted by data indicating that a high percentage of nearmidair collisions reported to the FAA in terminal areas involve VFR aircraftthat are not required to be under the control of ATC. Thus, the overallobjective of this rule is to substantially increase safety while accommodatingthe legitimate concerns of airspace users. Costs-Benefits Analysis <ITAG tagnum="81">a. Costs </ITAG>The FAA estimates the total cost expected to accrue from implementationof this rule to be $6.1 million ($3.4 million, discounted) in 1987 dollars.Approximately $2.7 million (discounted) or 80 percent of the total estimatedcosts will be incurred by the FAA primarily for training and additionalpersonnel. The remaining costs will be incurred by small GA aircraft operatorswho will be required under this rule to equip their aircraft with ModeC transponders sooner than they would have for the ARSA under the previousFAA rule: ``Transponder With Automatic Altitude Reporting Capability Requirement(Mode C)'' (53 FR 23356, June 21, 1988). This rule will be implementedin two phases. Phase I, which began July 1, 1989, will require a transponderwith Mode C at and above 10,000 feet MSL and in the vicinity (30 nauticalmiles) of TCA primary airports. There are currently 23 TCA's. Phase II will implement a transponder with Mode C requirement in the airspacein the vicinity (10 nautical miles) of ARSA primary airports. Phase IIbecomes effective on December 30, 1990, and will affect over 135 ARSA's.Also in Phase II, a transponder with Mode C will be required at other designatedairports for which either a TCA or ARSA has not been adopted. Consequently,most aircraft without Mode C transponders will need ATC authorization tofly within 30 nautical miles of a primary TCA airport, within 10 nauticalmiles of a primary ARSA airport, or within controlled airspace of otherdesignated airports that will also require Mode C transponders. Thus, this evaluation, as well as the Mode C rule, assumes that all aircraftwithout Mode C will acquire such equipment rather than circumnavigate thesubject airport. The only aircraft without this equipment will be thosewithout electrical systems. Costs to these types of aircraft operatorshave already been accounted for by the Mode C rule. As a result, aircraftoperators impacted by this rule will only incur the opportunity cost ofcapital by requiring them to acquire, install, and maintain Mode C transpondersone and a half years earlier than they would be required to do so in accordancewith Phase II of the Mode C rule. <ITAG tagnum="81">b. Benefits </ITAG>This final rule is expected to generate potential benefits primarily inthe form of enhanced safety to the aviation community and the flying public.Such safety, for instance, would take the form of reduced casualty losses(namely, aviation fatalities and property damage) resulting from a loweredlikelihood of midair collisions because of increased control in airspaceto be established by the TCA. In addition, potential benefits are expectedto accrue in the form of improved operational efficiency on the part ofFAA air traffic controllers. Ordinarily, the potential benefits of this rule will be the reduction inthe probability of midair collisions resulting from converting the existingARSA to a TCA. However, because of the recent Mode C rule (and to someextent, the rule for Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance (TCAS), 54 FR940, January 10, 1989), the number of potential midair collisions avoidedby this rule is expected to be significantly lower. Nevertheless, thisrule is still expected to accrue benefits in terms of enhanced safety,though on a much smaller scale.This point can be illustrated with the use of statistical models basedon actual and projected critical near midair collision (NMAC) incidentsin lieu of actual midair collisions (A critical NMAC is an event involvingtwo aircraft coming within 100 feet of each other; the fact that they donot collide is not due to an action on the part of either pilot; but, rather,it is due purely to chance.) Since midair collisions involving Part 135aircraft and especially Part 121 aircraft are rare, the use of criticalNMAC's will serve to illustrate, to some degree, the potential improvementsin aviation safety of implementing this rule. Simple regression analyses were prepared for this evaluation which focusedon critical NMAC's and aircraft operations in the 23 existing TCA's andin a random sample of 23 of the existing 79 ARSA's (as of 1986 and 1987).The results of these analyses indicated that TCA's have approximately 68percent fewer critical NMAC's annually, on average, than ARSA's. Whilethere is no demonstrated relationship between NMAC's and actual midaircollisions, the lower NMAC rate does indicate a more efficient separationof aircraft in congested airspace. As the result of these findings, if the existing Charlotte ARSA were toremain unchanged (and the recent Mode C and TCAS rules were not in effect),the Charlotte Terminal Area would be expected to experience approximately2.4 critical NMAC's annually (or 37 critical NMAC's over the next 15 years).If, however, the ARSA were to become a TCA, this figure would reduce toapproximately 0.7 critical NMAC's annually (or 12 critical NMAC's overthe next 15 years) Thus, over the next 15 years, this rule could resultin the reduction of approximately 25 critical NMAC's. However, it is importantto note that many, if not most, of these potential critical NMAC's wouldnever materialize as predicted primarily because of the ``Mode C'' ruleas it is applied to the Charlotte ARSA and, to some extent, the ``TCAS''rule. According to Phase II of the Mode C rule, all aircraft operating within10 nautical miles (except for flights under the outer 5 mile ``shelf'')of an ARSA primary airport must be equipped with a Mode C transponder.Phase I of the Mode C rule requires, as of July 1989, aircraft operatingwithin 30 nautical miles of a TCA to be equipped with a Mode C transponder.These requirements are expected to significantly reduce the risk of midaircollisions in ARSA's and TCA's. For this reason, the primary safety benefitof this rule to create a TCA in 1989 at Charlotte is that the safety enhancementsof the Mode C and TCAS requirements will occur one and a half years earlierthan they otherwise would be expected without this rule. A second safetybenefit would be in terms of the lowered likelihood of midair collisionsas the result of expanding the lateral boundaries of positive ATC by 20nautical miles through replacing the Charlotte ARSA with a TCA. The safety benefits of the establishment of a new TCA, while positive,will be less than would otherwise accrue in the absence of the Mode C andTCAS rules. Since this rule essentially extends the effects of the ModeC rule, virtually all of its potential safety benefits are assumed to bepart of that rule. Such benefits cannot be estimated separately and, therefore,are considered to be inextricably linked primarily to the Mode C rule.Over a 15-year period, the Mode C rule is expected to generate total potentialsafety benefits of $344 million (discounted, in 1987 dollars). (The ModeC rule benefits estimate of $310 million for 10 years has been adjustedto a 15-year period for the purpose of comparability with the TCAS ruleand other FAA rulemaking actions.) It is important to note that part ofthese safety benefits would be attributed to the TCAS rule. Thus, the potentialsafety benefits of this rule, and the Mode C and TCAS rules are consideredto be inextricably linked. Another potential benefit of this rule will be improved operational efficiencyon the part of FAA air traffic controllers. Under this rule, Mode C transponderrequirements will ease controller workload per aircraft being controlledbecause of the reduction in radio communications. The rule will also makepotential traffic conflicts more readily apparent to the controller. Asthe result of improved operational efficiency, the impact of the controllerworkload increased by separation requirements in the TCA will be somewhatoffset because of the controller's ability to adjust the volume of VFRtraffic in any given portion of the TCA. Improved operational efficiency should generate other types of benefitsin the form of significant reductions in the number of VFR aircraft requestsdenied and VFR aircraft delayed during busy periods. As the result of convertingthe existing Charlotte ARSA to a TCA, the improved operational efficiencywill accrue because of the availability of additional air traffic controllers.If the Charlotte ARSA were to remain intact, such air traffic personnelwould not be required. Therefore, potential benefits of improved operationalefficiency, which are not considered to be quantifiable in monetary termsin this evaluation, will be attributed to this rule rather than eitherthe Mode C rule or TCAS rule. <ITAG tagnum="81">c. Comparison of Benefits and Costs </ITAG>The total cost that will accrue from implementation of this rule is estimatedto be $3.4 million (discounted, in 1987 dollars). Approximately, 20 percentof this total cost estimate will fall on those GA aircraft operators withoutMode C transponders in the form of opportunity costs by requiring themto acquire such avionics equipment, including maintenance, one and a halfyears sooner than they otherwise would under the status quo. The typicalindividual GA aircraft operator impacted will incur an estimated one-timecost ranging from $126 to $280 (discounted) under this rule. (As the resultof the opportunity cost concept, the derivation of these cost estimatesare too complex to discuss briefly. Therefore, the reader should referto the detailed regulatory evaluation, which is contained in the docket,for a full explanation of the method by which these costs estimates weremade.) The potential benefits of this rule will be the lowered likelihood of midaircollisions from the conversion of the existing ARSA to a TCA. The numberof midair collisions avoided and their respective monetary values cannotbe estimated for this rule independent of the Mode C and TCAS rules, butthe FAA believes the risk will be substantially reduced. An FAA analysisprepared for this evaluation, however, has shown that critical near midaircollisions occur approximately two-thirds less frequently in a TCA thanin an ARSA. The FAA believes that even after the aviation community complieswith the Mode C and TCAS rules, locations converting from ARSA's to TCA'swould continue to experience reduced critical NMAC's. In addition, thisrule will generate improved operational efficiency benefits on the partof FAA air traffic controllers, though they are not considered to be quantifiablein monetary terms. Clearly, in view of the cost of compliance relative to the significantreduction in the likelihood of midair collisions as well as improved operationalefficiency in the Charlotte Terminal Area, the FAA firmly believes thisrule is cost-beneficial. The Regulatory Evaluation that has been placed in the docket contains additionaldetailed information related to the costs and benefits that are expectedto accrue from the implementation of this final rule. <ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Flexibility Determination </ITAG>The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (RFA) was enacted to ensure thatsmall entities are not unnecessarily and disproportionately burdened byGovernment regulations. The RFA requires agencies to review rules whichmay have ``a significant economic impact on a substantial number of smallentities.''The small entities which could be potentially affected by the implementationof this rule are unscheduled operators of aircraft for hire who own nineor fewer aircraft. Virtually all of the aircraft operators impacted by this rule will be thosewho acquire Mode C transponder capability. The FAA believes that all unscheduledaircraft operators (namely, air taxi operators) potentially impacted bythis rule already have Mode C transponders due to the fact that such operatorsfly regularly in or near airports where radar approach control servicehas been established. Even if some of these operators were to acquire,install, and maintain Mode C transponders, the cost will not have a significanteconomic impact on a substantial number of them. The annual FAA thresholdfor significant economic impact is $3,700 (1987 dollars) for a small entity.According to FAA Order 2100.14A (Regulatory Flexibility Criteria and Guidance),the definition of a small entity, in terms of an air taxi operator, isone with nine aircraft owned, but not necessarily operated. If we were to assume that a particular aircraft operator had nine aircraftwithout transponders, then the one-time cost per aircraft will be approximately$243. This figure represents the annualized cost for each impacted aircraft.The total cost per small entity will amount to an estimated $2,187. Thus,the annual worst case cost for a small entity will fall far below the FAA'sannual threshold of $3,700. Therefore, the FAA believes this rule willnot have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of smallentities.<ITAG tagnum="84">International Trade Impact Assessment </ITAG>This final rule will neither have an effect on the sale of foreign aviationproducts or services in the United States, nor will it have an effect onthe sale of U.S. products or services in foreign countries. This is becausethe rule will only potentially impact small GA aircraft operators withoutMode C, and not aircraft manufacturers. The average cost of acquiring ModeC capability is estimated to range from $900 (to upgrade from a Mode Atransponder) to $2,000 (to acquire a Mode C transponder without havinga Mode A transponder). The cost of acquiring Mode C capability is not consideredto be high enough to discourage potential buyers of small GA airplanes.<ITAG tagnum="84">Federalism Implications </ITAG>This regulation will not have substantial direct effects on the states,on the relationship between the national government and the states, oron the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levelsof government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, preparationof a Federalism assessment is not warranted. <ITAG tagnum="84">Conclusion </ITAG>For the reasons discussed under ``Regulatory Evaluation,'' the FAA hasdetermined that this regulation is not a ``major rule'' under ExecutiveOrder 12291 This rulemaking is considered a ``significant rule'' underDOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979).It is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impacton a substantial number of small entities. The FAA has determined that the users of the Charlotte/Douglas InternationalAirport and surrounding area will benefit from the implementation of theTCA. In order to obtain this benefit at the earliest time, the FAA willhave the TCA charted on the next available charting date, which is August24, 1989, and is making the implementation of the TCA effective on thatcharting date. Therefore, due to the need to implement the TCA at the earliestpossible time, the FAA finds good cause for making this amendment effectivein 16 days from the date of the publication of this amendment. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 71 </ITAG>Aviation safety, Terminal control areas, Airport radar service areas. <ITAG tagnum="84">Adoption of the Amendment </ITAG>Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me, part 71 of theFederal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) is amended as follows: <ITAG tagnum="56">PART 71_DESIGNATION OF FEDERAL AIRWAYS, AREA LOW ROUTES, CONTROLLEDAIRSPACE AND REPORTING POINTS </ITAG>1.
