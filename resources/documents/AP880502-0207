(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The United Auto Workers and ChryslerCorp. moved closer to a national contract settlement Monday afterwrapping up all but final details of related agreements coveringformer American Motors Corp. workers in Wisconsin, a union officialsaid.   ``It means now we can turn our full attention to the nationaltalks. They're going very well,'' UAW Vice President Marc Steppsaid, adding that since last week, Chrysler management's ``attitudehas changed for the positive.''   UAW President Owen Bieber, who on Monday joined nationalcontract talks covering 66,000 Chrysler workers in 15 states, saidChrysler and the UAW reached tentative settlements on a master pactcovering all former AMC workers in Wisconsin and a local contractcovering 6,500 workers in Kenosha, Wis.   ``We had to get this piece settled before we could settle therest. There was no way that we were going to put together thenational agreement and let these people hang out there bythemselves,'' Bieber said.   ``Now we can get down to the bigger things,'' he said, addingthe only deadline set for finishing national contract talks is ``assoon as we possibly can.''   The four-year Kenosha pact covers 5,500 workers who will be laidoff in the closing of an assembly plant at year's end and 1,000workers at an engine plant that will remain open.   The master Wisconsin pact, which covers all UAW workers who wereemployed by AMC in the state when Chrysler bought the ailingautomaker in August, will give Kenosha workers about 88 percent, or$57 million, of nearly $65 million AMC owed them, said Chryslerspokesman Lloyd Northard. He said $2.2 million of the $57 millionalready was paid in 1985.   The Kenosha payments, which will average between $6,000 and$8,000 per worker, will be 100 percent of the money AMC borrowedfrom workers early in the decade but will not include interest AMChad promised, Northard said. About 9,000 workers, including thoseemployed by 1982 at one time or another between 1982 and 1987, willbe eligible for the payments, Northard said.   Under the same pact, about 200 Milwaukee workers at a partsdepot and 425 laid off from a stamping plant there will receive thesame percentage of more than $5 million AMC owed them under themaster pact.   Bieber said the master pact would guarantee laid-off workers sixmonths of supplemental unemployment benefits, which are paid inaddition to regular unemployment compensation to provide 95 percentof regular pay. In addition, it makes it easier for workers toretire early and matches pension benefits to those at GeneralMotors Corp. and Ford Motor Co., he said.   Chrysler and the union are negotiating their national contractalong the lines of an industry-pattern contract established lastfall at GM and Ford, but have adapted some elements, including acrucial job-security provision.   Talks on Chrysler's contract, which expires Sept. 14, openedApril 18. Last week, the Wisconsin talks were moved to Detroit sobargainers for both sides could negotiate all contractssimultaneously.   The tentative Kenosha local pact appears similar to a five-yearagreement reached in October covering Jeep plant workers in Toledo,Ohio. Both pacts give the company more flexibility in using workers.   Ed Steagall, president of UAW Local 72 at Kenosha, said about 20percent of the Kenosha workers will be able to retire early andlaid-off Kenosha workers will have first crack at any new jobs atthe engine plant there.   Nick Romano, president of Local 75 in Milwaukee, said he alsowas pleased with the settlements, which will be voted on by nextweek.   ``I feel good about what's happening. I don't feel good aboutour plant being terminated in Milwaukee,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
