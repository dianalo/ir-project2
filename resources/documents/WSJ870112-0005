The unit, which comes 15 years after the computer maker introduced the world's first hand-held calculator, will retail for about $235, the company said.    Hewlett-Packard said the machine, known as the HP-28C, is designed primarily for engineers, scientists, mathemeticians and computer experts. It will allow them to tackle a range of problems not previously solvable on calulators by permitting the entering and storing of complex equations using mathematics symbols, the company said.    The calculator may be purchased with an optional battery-powered compact printer, priced at $135, linked to it by an infrared beam, Hewlett-Packard added. The company said it has already begun shipping the calculator and printer to retailers. </TEXT></DOC>
