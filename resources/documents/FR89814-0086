This proposed rate modification is a minor rate adjustmentpursuant to 10 CFR part 903. The Stampede Powerplant (Stampede) is a 3.65-MWhydroelectric facility that was placed in service on January 15, 1988.The current Stampede nonfirm energy rates were approved by the FederalEnergy Regulatory Commission (FERC) on February 10, 1987, at 40.45 mills/kilowatthour(kWh), or 27.86 mills/kWh plus annual operation and maintenance (Oandamp;M)responsibility. Western has not found a customer willing to purchase Stampedenonfirm energy at these approved rates. Presently, Stampede generationis being sold to Sierra Pacific Power Company (Sierra) under a short-termagreement at 80 percent of Sierra's quarterly weighted marginal cost. Thisnotice proposes a flexible annual rate formula that is intended to ensurethe maximum reasonable annual repayment of the Stampede power investmentat marketable rates.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</T2> Power rates for the Stampede Divisionare established pursuant to the Department of Energy (DOE) OrganizationAct of August 4, 1977 (42 U.S.C. 7101, <T3>et seq.</T3>); the Reclamation Act of 1902 (43 U.S.C. 372, <T3>et seq.</T3>), as amended and supplemented by subsequent enactments,particularly section 9(c) of the Reclamation Project Act of 1939 (43 U.S.C.485h(c)); and the Act of August 1, 1956, 70 Stat. 775, authorizing constructionof the Washoe Project. By Delegation Order No. 0204-108, effective December 14, 1983 (48 FR 55664),as amended May 30, 1986 (51 FR 19744), the Secretary of Energy delegated(1) the authority to develop long-term power and transmission rates tothe Administrator of Western; (2) the authority to confirm, approve, andplace such rates in effect on an interim basis to the Under Secretary ofthe Department of Energy; and (3) the authority to confirm, approve, andplace in effect on a final basis, to remand, or to disapprove such ratesto the FERC. On October 27, 1988, the Secretary of Energy issued a notice,DOE N 1110.29, amending Delegation Order No. 0204-108 by transferring authorityto place rates into effect on an interim basis from the Under Secretaryof the Department of Energy to the Deputy Secretary of the Department ofEnergy. This order was published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on January 26, 1989 (54 FR 3841). This noticeof proposed modification of rates is issued pursuant to the delegationto the Administrator and the rate adjustment procedures at 10 CFR part903, published at 50 FR 37835 on September 18, 1985. Western is developing these rates for Stampede Division, Washoe Project,in accordance with Reclamation Law, DOE financial reporting policies, procedures,and methodology (DOE Order No. RA 6120.2, September 20, 1979), and theprocedures for public participation in rate adjustments found in 10 CFRpart 903 (1985). This notice initiates the public proceedings for a minor rate adjustmentannouncing the rates under consideration and the beginning of the 30-dayconsultation and comment period. Neither a public information forum nora comment forum will be held. Under DOE procedures, such forums are optionalfor minor rate adjustments, which include rate adjustments for power systemswith installed capacity of less than 20,000 kilowatt (kW). Stampede capacityis 3,650 kW, well under the 20,000-kW limit. Western has decided not to hold public forums because this is a minor ratefor a small quantity of nonfirm energy, and the marketing of that energyis not expected to raise any significant or controversial issues of factor law. <ITAG tagnum="84">Background </ITAG>Stampede Dam and Reservoir are located on the Little Truckee River approximately8 miles above the confluence of the Little Truckee and Truckee Rivers.The dam and reservoir are in Sierra County, California, about 11 milesnortheast of the town of Truckee. The water source for Stampede Reservoiris the Little Truckee River drainage basin containing about 136 squaremiles of dense wooded slopes and grass meadowlands. When the Stampede Dam and Reservoir were authorized in 1956, hydroelectricpower development was included. Power facilities were not constructed atthe time Stampede Dam was built during the period 1966 to 1970 becausethe power function was not economically justified. Nevertheless, provisionswere made to facilitate the addition of power facilities at a later date.A preliminary reevaluation of Stampede was published in a special Bureauof Reclamation (Reclamation) report, ``Adding Powerplants at Existing FederalDams in California,'' July 1976. The report recommended construction ofa powerplant. Definite Plan Report studies were initiated in fiscal year(FY) 1977; the powerplant was constructed and went on-line in January 1988.Originally, operation of Stampede Dam and Reservoir was to fulfill threepurposes: flood control, fisheries enhancement, and recreation. Power generation,resulting from the addition of Stampede at the dam, adds a fourth purpose.Stampede provides approximately 10 million kWh annually. The power plantis operated as an unattended plant with automatic means for maintainingrelatively constant downstream water releases in the event of unit shutdown.Generator control is automatic with capability for complete shutdown. Under a contract with Western, Sierra constructed a \1/2\-mile, 60-kilovolt(kV) transmission line between the Stampede power facility and Sierra'sexisting 60-kV transmission system for the purpose of delivering energyto Sierra's system. All plant and switchyard controls are centrally locatedinside the powerplant. The energy generated by Stampede has an initial priority reservation fordesignated Washoe Project loads. The Lahontan National Fish Hatchery andthe Marble Bluff Fish Facility were designated by Reclamation and Westernas project loads of the Washoe Project. This designation makes the Fishand Wildlife Service facilities eligible to be served by Stampede on apriority basis. The projected demand of these facilities should not exceed500-kW peakload and 2 million kWh annually. Due to the current inabilityto receive Stampede energy, the designated project-use loads are not currentlybeing served by Stampede, and 100 percent of the output of Stampede isbeing sold to Sierra. Energy generated at Stampede is nonfirm, and exceptfor the energy (if any) supplied to serve the project-use loads, will besold as provided in this notice. On October 25, 1985, Western designated Truckee-Donner Public Utility District(Truckee-Donner) as the commercial customer for Stampede energy (50 FR43456). Western established a 50-year levelized repayment rate of 40.45mills/kWh approved by the FERC on February 10, 1987. From the time Stampedeenergy was allocated to Truckee-Donner through December 1988, Western attemptedto fulfill the contract with Truckee-Donner, but was not sucessful forvarious reasons. One key factor was that the Stampede levelized rate wasabove the region's nonfirm energy market levels. In the spring of 1989,Western determined a need to create an alternate rate approach. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATES: </T2>The consultation and comment period will begin with publicationof this notice in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>and will end September 13, 1989.

Coleman, Area Manager,Western Area Power Administration, Sacramento Area Office, 1825 Bell Street,Suite 105, Sacramento, CA 95825, (916) 649-4418.<ITAG tagnum="84">Proposed Rates</ITAG>Western is proposing an annual bidding process for Stampede nonfirm energy.Annual bids for Stampede generation will only be considered if they meetor exceed the minimum rate (or Floor Rate) Western considers necessaryto meet the expense of operating the plant. In addition, Western will annuallycalculate the conventional cost-based rate necessary to meet the Stampederepayment obligation. This rate will be considered the highest necessarybid (or the Ceiling Rate) for the Stampede energy. Western will annuallyissue a public notice in the appropriate publications in the region, aswell as letters to customers and interested parties, to the effect thatStampede nonfirm energy is available to the highest bidder at a rate rangingbetween the established Floor and Ceiling Rates contained in the publicnotice. Entities interested in purchasing the Stampede energy will submitbids to Western indicating the rate they are willing to pay within theseparameters. If the highest bid is submitted by more than one entity, selectionof the purchaser will be based on the criteria discussed later in thisnotice.The range of rates that Western will consider for Stampede nonfirm energygeneration will be as follows, as measured at the Stampede Substation andas determined by Western.<ITAG tagnum="84">Stampede NonFirm Energy Floor Rate (Floor Rate)</ITAG>The Floor Rate will be based on the greater of either (a) the rate necessaryto recover the projected annual Oandamp;M expenses for Stampede plus 2 millsper kWh, or (b) 85 percent of the purchaser's projected average annualmarginal energy cost as measured at its point of receipt for such energy.This rate is intended to, at a minimum, recover the annual power Oandamp;Mexpenses of the Stampede facility plus part of the annual interest expense.However, if the region's energy market is causing a potential purchaserto pay higher rates for energy than the calculated Oandamp;M-expense basedFloor Rate, then Western is proposing that the Stampede energy sale wouldoccur at 85 percent of the purchaser's demonstrated average annual marginalcost alternative, up to the Ceiling Rate discussed below.This proposal is intended to ensure that Stampede will only be operatedif there is an economic benefit to do so, and at the same time attemptsto ensure the maximum reasonable revenue recovery by the Stampede Divisionwhile still benefiting the purchaser.Estimation of a potential purchaser's average annual marginal cost alternativewill be based on marginal cost filings made with regulatory entities, projectedload and resource plans, as well as previous actual marginal cost experience.Western will review the basis for all bids as part of its annual selectionprocess. Within 120 days of the termination of any annual Stampede energysale, a recalculation of the Floor Rate will be made based on actual annualcost data. The bidder will be required to supply an analysis verifyingthat the Stampede energy purchases were made at or above 85 percent ofthe bidder's actual experienced marginal cost for the year. If the Stampedeenergy purchases were not at or above the actual annual Floor Rate, thenthe purchaser shall compensate Western for such difference in a lump sumpayment that will be billed to the purchaser by Western.<ITAG tagnum="84">Stampede Nonfirm Energy Ceiling Rate (Ceiling Rate)</ITAG>The Ceiling Rate will be the cost-based rate determined by Western to benecessary to repay the Stampede power investment and annual expenses overthe remaining repayment period of the power facilities. It is expectedthat this rate will increase annually to the extent that Stampede energyis sold below the Ceiling Rate each year.

Station-service and project-use loads will have first priorityto Stampede generation. All remaining generation will be made availableas generated at the Stampede Substation, hereinafter, the point of delivery.The purchaser is responsible for acquiring any transmission or utilityservices beyond the point of delivery.<ITAG tagnum="84">Bidding Process</ITAG>1. Western will contract to sell Stampede generation each year for a periodstarting October 1 and continuing through September 30 of the next year.Western will issue a notice requesting bids on or about April 1 of eachyear. Western's notice shall be in the form of letters to interested partiesand newspaper publications. Such notice shall contain the applicable Floorand Ceiling Rates, and the Stampede 1-year contract terms of the proposedsale. Western will accept bid responses received on or before August 1.Western will then review the responses and make a selection of a purchaseron or before September 1. Western will notify all parties that submittedbids of its decision in writing. Western's selection of a purchaser shallbe an acceptance of the purchaser's offer to purchase at the rate(s) bid.Western and the purchaser shall confirm the Stampede energy sale by letteragreement, which will be consistent with the contract terms contained inthe request for bids, as soon as practicable thereafter. 2. The timing and implementation of the first bid cycle is uncertain andwill be described in a schedule contained in the first bid notice.3. Bids shall be submitted in not less than 0.5 mill/kWh increments. Allfloor bids based on 85 percent of the proposed purchaser's average annualmarginal cost, must contain information supporting the marginal cost calculationand a discussion of the proposed purchaser's ability to take Stampede generationat the point of delivery identified in the contract terms contained inthe bid solititation.\2\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ All information submitted supporting a bid will be consideredproprietary and held as confidential to the extent allowed by Federal law.The actual bid rates received by Western may be disclosed to support Western'sdecision process.4. If a bid is not received at a level at or above the Floor Rate basedon the Stampede Oandamp;M expenses, Western will repeat its bid request quarterlyuntil such time that an acceptable bid is received. 5. If a tie occurs in the bidding process, Western will determine the purchaserto receive Stampede generation. Criteria that Western will use in thisdetermination are: a. Preference will be given to entities entitled to preference under 43U.S.C. 485h(c).b. Greater consideration will be given to entities that can assist Westernin delivering Stampede energy to the qualified project-use loads.<ITAG tagnum="84">FERC Process/Rate Approval</ITAG>1. Western is proposing that FERC review and approve this Stampede nonfirmenergy rate formula for 5 years. Western will retain the option of initiatinga rate-adjustment process at any time during the approved 5-year rate periodin accordance with 10 CFR Part 903, provided that any such new or adjustedrates shall not apply to a then-current purchaser for the remaining durationof its purchase from Stampede.2. Western will annually report to FERC the basis for the Floor Rate, theCeiling Rate, the status of Stampede Division repayment, and any decisionnot to operate the powerplant during a given period.<ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Flexibility Analysis</ITAG>Pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Act) of 1980 (5 U.S.C. 601,<T3> et seq.</T3>), each agency, when required by 5 U.S.C. 553 to publisha proposed rule, is further required to prepare and make available forpublic comment an initial regulatory flexibility analysis to describe theimpact of the proposed rule on small entities. In this instance, the rateadjustment for Stampede relates to nonregulatory services provided by Westernat a particular rate. Under 5 U.S.C. 601(2), rates or services of particularapplicability are not considered rules within the meaning of the Act. Sincethe rate for Stampede power is of limited applicability and is being setin accordance with specific regulations and legislation under particularcircumstances, Western believes that no flexibility analysis is required.<ITAG tagnum="84">Environmental Evaluation</ITAG>In compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 and DOEregulations published in the<T4> Federal Register</T4> (45 FR 20695-20701, as amended), Western isreviewing the environmental impacts of these proposed rates for the StampedeDivision and will determine whether it involves a major Federal actionhaving a significant adverse impact on the environment.<ITAG tagnum="84">Executive Order 12291</ITAG>The purpose of Executive Order 12291, dated February 17, 1981, is to reducethe burdens of existing and future regulations, increase agency accountabilityfor regulatory actions, provide for presidential oversight of the regulatoryprocess, minimize duplication and conflict of regulations, and insure well-reasonedregulations.The DOE has determined that this is not a major rule pursuant to the criteriaof section 1(b) of the order. Furthermore, Western has received an exemptionfrom sections 3, 4, and 7 of Executive Order 12291, and therefore has notprepared a regulatory impact statement.<ITAG tagnum="84">Availability of Information</ITAG>All brochures, studies, comments, letters, memorandums, and other documentsmade or kept by Western for the purpose of developing the proposed alternativerates are and will be available for inspection and copying at the SacramentoArea Office, Western Area Power Administration, 1825 Bell Street, Suite105, Sacramento, California 95825, (916) 649-4418.<ITAG tagnum="21">Issued at Golden, Colorado, July 21, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">William H.
