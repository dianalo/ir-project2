The move sparked street protests and was denounced byopposition parties and women's groups.   ``Like the water lily is the state flower, Islam shall be thestate religion,'' Information Minister Mahbubur Rahman toldreporters before Prime Minister Maudud Ahmed introduced the bill inthe house.   The bill was expected to pass easily because the ruling JatiyaParty of President Hussain Muhammad Ershad holds 251 of the 300seats.   ``The government is trying to divide the nation in the name ofIslam,'' opposition member Shahjehan Siraj said. ``Government seemsto have some bad motives behind it.''   Witnesses and opposition leaders said at least 50 people wereinjured when more than 1,000 opposition supporters stoned sixgovernment-owned buses in downtown Dhaka.   Bangladesh's 105 million people are 85 percent Moslem, withChristian, Hindu and Buddhist minorities. The country has had asecular constitution since it won independence from Pakistan in1971.   Ershad told a religious gathering in March that ``the day-to-daylife of the nation must be guided by the tenets of Islam and theideals of Prophet Mohammed.''   ``This law will curtail the activities of the fundamentalists,who are gaining ground because of Islamic slogans,'' said a seniorleader in Ershad's Jatiya Party, who spoke on condition ofanonymity.   The constitutional amendment is the first major bill to comebefore the Parliament, which was elected last March 3. Mostopposition parties boycotted that election, and only about half ofthe nation's 48 million eligible voters cast ballots.   Twenty-one opposition groups, which have been agitating sincelast November for the ouster of Ershad, pledged to oppose anyattempts by the Parliament to change the constitution. Theseparties, which have no seats in the house, contend Parliament doesnot represent the people.   But Ahmed promised that the bill would not be rushed to passage.``There shall be enough time for the opposition to speak on it,''he said.   ``The government will seek public opinion on the legislation,''he added.   Several women's rights groups have already held demonstrationsagainst the idea of making Islam the state religion.</TEXT></DOC>
