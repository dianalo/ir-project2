(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A woman at odds with her husband over whoshould have control of their frozen embryos says the eggs representlife and the case should be looked at as a custody battle.   Her husband says the eggs represent his future and that he shouldbe allowed to determine if he becomes a father or not.   The courts don't know what to say as there isn't much precedentconcerning in-vitro fertilization and divorce.   ``I consider them life,'' Mary Sue Davis, 28, said of the eggsthat she and Junior Lewis Davis placed in frozen storage a few yearsago as part of the in-vitro fertilization program at Fort SandersRegional Medical Center in Knoxville.   ``If I cannot have them, then I'd like to donate them to anotherperson,'' she said in an interview Saturday at the couple's log homein the foothills of the Smoky Mountains.   Davis, 30, filed a divorce petition last month that also askedfor a temporary restraining order preventing his wife from havingany of the seven eggs implanted. The document called them jointproperty.   Blount County Circuit Judge W. Dale Young quickly granted theorder as attorneys searched for any court rulings that could guidethem. No further court dates have been set.   Davis said his wife's ability to have the embryos implanted afterthe divorce violates his right to control his own future.   He did not ask that the embryos be destroyed.   It's unsettling ``to know that ... 10 years from now I could bewalking down the street and bump into my child and not know it,'' hesaid.   He also objects to Mrs. Davis donating the embryos to anotherwoman.   ``I would not let her donate,'' he said. ``If I would not let herhave them, why would I give them to a complete stranger?''   The Davises met while both were in the Army and stationed in WestGermany, he as a serviceman and she as a secretary.   After they were married in 1979, they moved to Tennessee whereshe works as a service representative at a boat company in nearbyKnoxville and he is an electrical technician for the MaryvilleHousing Authority.   The Davises were unable to conceive a child and gave up onadoption when they learned their only chances were for fosterchildren, who later could be taken away.   They opted for in-vitro fertilization, which involves surgicallyremoving a woman's eggs from her ovaries and fertilizing them with aman's sperm in a laboratory dish.   The embryos are then either implanted or frozen for futureimplantation.   Frozen embryos are viable for several years, the divorce petitionsaid.   The chances of a pregnancy are about 15 percent with each eggthat is implanted, in-vitro fertilization specialists say. Eachimplant costs between $4,000 and $10,000.   The couple said they never signed a contract before entering theprogram and never discussed what would happen to the eggs shouldsomething happen to either of them. Such contracts are fairly commonin ``test tube baby'' cases.   Mrs. Davis said the eggs are the result of years of surgery,tests and self-administered injections and are her best shot atbecoming a mother.   ``I would love to be a mother,'' she said. ``I'm not even sure Ican go through the program again. It's a very hard process, mentallyand physically.''   She also said that if she became pregnant with any of the embryosshe would consider raising the child by herself and not seek childsupport.   ``I respect her (view),'' Davis said. ``But the fact remains thatshe can still have a baby through another donor.''   The only case resembling the Davises' seems to be that of a LosAngeles couple killed in a 1983 airplane crash.   The couple, Mario and Elsa Rios, did not leave instructions onwhat to do with the embryos they had in frozen storage. Debatefollowed as to whether the fertilized eggs should be destroyed,implanted inside another woman or left frozen.   The embryos remain frozen and are stored at the MonashUniversity-Queen Victoria Medical Centre in Melbourne, Australia,where the Rios' had participated in an in-vitro fertilizationprogram, a hospital spokeswoman said last week.</TEXT></DOC>
