Woolpert, president; Graniterock; Watsonville;    Innovative, yes,perhaps. But if the county transportation commission has $17,000 sittingaround to help a successful, profit-making company purchase a carpool van, whynot use the money to help some non-profit group? It galls me to see taxdollars given to the private sector when there are so many deserving publicprojects. If you are so supportive of the plan, why not come up with the$17,000 yourselves on top of the maintenance and operating costs you'll bedonating toward the van project?;    P.S.: Thanks for sending a &quot;cc:&quot; of yourletter of complaint to my boss. I'm not certain that he always has the time toread each and every one of my columns and your note probably got him to payattention to my scribblings that one Monday.;  I WAS SURPRISED at yourone-dimensional view of the Westside Longs Drug matter. A more completeanalysis might have produced a broader and clearer view, and a betterassessment of community benefits . . .;    Once in a while a major retailer isso resoundingly successful it becomes a social institution. Longs is one ofthose . . . In nearly every case the coming of Longs has meant the going-awayof an independent pharmacist or two. This seems to be one of the ways a freesociety works. Economic Darwinism, perhaps.;    William M. Cox; Santa Cruz;   My &quot;one-dimensional&quot; view of Longs is neither pro nor con. But my view thatneighborhood integrity is threatened when projects unwanted by nearbyresidents are approved anyway is shared by many other Santa Cruzans.;  GREATCOLUMN, Lee . . . Other business would be affected, too, I think.;    DoniTunheim; Santa Cruz;    The two drugstores within a block-and-a-half willcertainly be affected. There is another pharmacy going in already at Laureland Mission. As far as other businesses, such as Z's liquor store, I guessthat's possible.;  I SWEAR I read your column twice because I thought surelythis was tongue-in-cheek; you were putting us on. But I guess you wereserious.;    Rex Boys; Watsonville;    Rex, I guess your comments are germaneto almost any of my columns. Forgive me if you ever think I'm writingsomething serious. Everything I write is tongue-in-cheek.;  YOUR COLUMN todaywas very interesting.;    You are mourning the loss of a single, unifiedvision of America built unconsciously around European and European Americanvalues, insights, ideas and goals. Best wishes with your exploration ofAmerica, the multicultural. Grasp the nettle and you will find riches ofexpression that we have been blind to.;    Dale Warner, secretary; EuropeanAmerican Study Group; San Jose;    I refuse to grasp the nettle. I've triedthat in the past and it always stings.;  ARE YOU still writing for the MercuryNews? Send me something you wrote.;    Dad; Wilmette, Ill.;    It's in themail.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Lee Quarnstrom column  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Santa Cruz/Monterey  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   911216  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Monday  </DAY><MONTH>  December  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  545  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Monday, December 16, 199100351190,SJ1  </DATELINE><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
