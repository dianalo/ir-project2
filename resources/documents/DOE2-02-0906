The concepts of both sensors are specified and some of theircharacteristics. The paper reports the application of the optical fibercolour recognition sensor in sorting objects of different colours andthe application of the optical fiber proximity sensor for collision avoidance.Although both sensors have been developed for robotics they can easilybe used in other branches of industry.</TEXT></DOC>
