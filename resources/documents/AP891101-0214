(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Carl Hofmann has lost house, work, wife andson.   ``When a person gets down low, it's hard to get your feet backabove water,'' said Hofmann, 49, who suffers from depression andstays in a Catholic Social Services residence for people who arehomeless and mentally ill.   Then he met Social Security field representative James Keeler,who helped him apply for federal disability benefits.   ``He took a lot of time with me. I really appreciated that.''   Hofmann and others like him are benefiting from a renewed effortby the Social Security Administration to reach the homeless. Theorders came in April. Then-Commissioner Dorcas R. Hardy, fightingto keep her job, directed employees to work more closely withcommunity and religious groups serving the homeless.   Gwendolyn S. King, sworn in Aug. 1 as Hardy's successor, hassaid she wants to expand programs to find homeless and needy peoplewho may not realize they are entitled to Social Security orSupplemental Security Income benefits.   Advocates for the homeless say the initiative is sorely needed,but contend that at the same time Social Security has turned itsback on a program that could bring more homeless people into thesystem.   Part of the problem is that homeless people have no permanentaddresses and may have physical or mental problems that hinderdealings with bureaucracy.   ``A lot of the homeless people do not trust social serviceagencies and, in particular, the federal government,'' said GaryVan Scoy, assistant executive director for Catholic Social Servicesin Scranton. ``Even though it might provide them a permanent sourceof income, it takes a lot of convincing.''   Many Social Security offices around the country have heededHardy's call:   _In Baltimore, a field representative roams streets to persuadehomeless people to apply for benefits, even taking applications onpark benches.   _In Omaha, Neb., Social Security and the Eastern Nebraska Agencyon Aging set up a seminar to help community organizations identifyeligible people.   _In Chula Vista, Calif., Social Security joined with othersocial service providers to help people cope with the closing ofmobile-home parks due to land development. ``Those people werereally faced with homelessness,'' said Pamela B. Smith, districtmanager. ``They had nowhere to go and no one to help them.''   _Homeless coordinators have been appointed in all 151 fieldoffices in Pennsylvania, Maryland, Delaware, Virginia, WestVirginia and the District of Columbia, said Dennis R. Conroy,external affairs officer in Philadelphia.   At a recent ``Help the Homeless'' seminar in Scranton, about 60social workers, housing officials and others learned about SocialSecurity programs as well as training, mental health, drug abuseand housing programs available under the Stewart B. McKinneyHomeless Assistance Act.   The majority of homeless people, especially in cities, tend tobe men in their 20s to 30s, Conroy said. Social Security mostlygets involved with those who are disabled, although it also canhelp the elderly, who become homeless because they don't haveenough money to stay in a home.   Supplemental Security Income is a federal program run by SocialSecurity for the needy aged, blind and disabled, but paid fromincome taxes. The basic SSI payment is $368 a month for anindividual or $553 for a couple.   All states but Arkansas, Georgia, Kansas, Mississippi,Tennessee, Texas and West Virginia provide an optional supplement.SSI eligibility also makes a person eligible for medical assistancein all but Connecticut, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Oklahoma,Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, New Hampshire, North Carolina, NorthDakota and Virginia.   ``That to me is more valuable than the money,'' said MarionChristmas, 53, a homeless Philadelphia man on SSI disability whohas gotten payments since he was set afire Nov. 10, 1985, whileasleep at a church construction site in Columbia, S.C. He wasseverely burned and lost his left forearm.   Hofmann, in Scranton, expects to hear within three to six monthswhether he will get disability benefits. ``This is my fight to getback on top. I really believe I'm going to get it.''   Disability decisions average 78 days on initial claims, Conroysaid. The first level of appeal takes an average 60 more days. Thenext stage, a decision by a Social Security administrative lawjudge, takes an additional 210 days.   ``I don't know anybody who got it the first time around,'' saidSister Josephine McGrory of Mercy Hospice, a Philadelphiaresidential program for mentally ill homeless women. SocialSecurity needs people who can come on short notice to the homelessto do medical or psychological exams, she said.   ``It is a big problem getting doctors to respond to requests,''said Dolores Jefferson, an advocate in Philadelphia for thePennsylvania Department of Public Welfare's Disability AdvocacyProgram.   ``We're talking about some rather bad areas,'' said MaryColeman, a supervisor in the advocacy program. ``We may be talkingabout doctors having to do the interview on the street. Mostdoctors aren't willing to do it.''   Social Security also has had 17,000 employees dropped over thepast five years. Homeless advocates say greater reliance ontelephoned claims limit the face-to-face contact that might make orbreak their eligibility determination.   ``It sounds nice to write a memo exhorting Social Security tomake a special effort for the homeless, but it doesn't necessarilyresult in any action,'' said Maria Foscarinis, director of theWashington-based National Law Center on Homelessness and Poverty.   In fact, Hardy's April memo followed one in March 1988 urgingrepeal of a program to help the homeless. Department of Health andHuman Services staffers warned in other memos against pushing forrepeal during an election year. The law center obtained the memosunder the Freedom of Information Act.   The program, which has not been implemented, was authorized byCongress in 1987 to help state and local governments set up teamsto identify homeless people potentially eligible for SocialSecurity benefits.   Since obtaining the memos in August, the center has gotten``only a pro forma response which says the Social SecurityAdministration has no intention of enforcing the program, but thatthey're undertaking a whole series of other initiatives for thehomeless,'' Ms. Foscarinis said.   Complicating the picture is debate on whether drug addiction oralcoholism should be grounds for disability. SSA has contended itcould only be grounds in combination with another factor, such asorgan damage.   But the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court ruled in 1983 and again in 1985that alcoholism alone could be a compensable injury. U.S. DistrictCourt Judge John B. Hannum ruled in August that Social Security``systematically, continuously, willfully and almost scornfullyignored'' the earlier rulings.   Hannum ordered Health and Human Services Secretary Louis W.Sullivan to reopen all disability claims denied since 1983 inPennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware and the Virgin Islands and toreevaluate them on the basis that alcoholism alone could be acompensable injury. SSA has appealed.   Meanwhile, education efforts like the program in Scranton willcontinue, Conroy said. Social Security offices are compiling adirectory of agencies that provide services to the homeless and arepreparing audio tapes that can be used in shelters and residencesto explain available services. The agency also has tried tostreamline its application process and improved computer systems.   Nonetheless, he said, ``I don't see this as a short-term type ofthing.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Monday AMs, Nov. 6</NOTE></DOC>
