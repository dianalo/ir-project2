Wilson has been involved with computers since 1975.andP;  His newestchallenge is expanding Oracle Corp.'s array of database management productsdeeper into the federal market.andM;Wilson plans to sell to U.S.andP;  government operations overseas, something hesaid has not been done successfully by any of Oracle's competitors.andP;  Wilsonjoined Oracle last October as a group vice president for original equipmentmanufacturers and strategic accounts at the company's headquarters inBelmont, Calif.andP;  In June, he was tapped to head Oracle's Federal Division asa company vice president.andM;Before coming to Oracle, Wilson spent three years as vice president ofcorporate sales at Ingres Corp. of Alameda, Calif.andP;  From 1975 through 1986,he worked in computer sales for Comshare Inc. of Ann Arbor, Mich.andM;Karen D. Schwartz, GCN associate editor for software, interviewed Wilson atOracle's Federal Division in Bethesda, Md.andM;GCN: How does the government's reliance on standards affect your plans?andM;WILSON: Since we as a company have decided to meet all those standards, andas we've moved toward Secure Oracle and government-compliant financials, wehave made a commitment not only to be compliant, but to help the governmentdetermine a lot of standards.andP;  We currently are Posix-compliant.andM;We also are involved in the Computer-Aided Acquisition and Logistics Supportproject with major commitments, not only technical but organizational ones.andO;We are working with many other contractors on joint efforts.andM;GCN: How does the release of Oracle's Government Financials fit into your bigpicture?andM;WILSON: We are working diligently to make each of our modules fullygovernment-compliant as it comes out.andP;  We believe value-added is where themarket-place is going.andP;  We're moving to be the first pure services/totalsolution company in the marketplace, and financials are a way to do that.andM;Relational databases are an integral part, because they have the versatilityto modify easily and change from one operating system to another.andM;GCN: What else is coming down the road for the government from Oracle?andM;WILSON: We started asking ourselves how we run our company, and whether weshouldn't be running on our own software.andP;  We are building the applicationswe need for the fastest-growing software company in the world.andM;The government has similar needs.andP;  However, it requires modifications thatare unique and mandatory.andP;  We expect to have a complete range ofgovernment-compliant financials by the end of this fiscal year.andM;We've installed our manufacturing system in two places in the government.andO;Right now, we are going through a lot of testing to find out where we mightand might not be totally compliant.andP;  In those things where we are not totallycompliant, we will become compliant.andM;GCN: What do you see as the hardware architecture trend among governmentagencies?andM;WILSON: It is awesome to see the amount of different hardware out there.andP;  Wejust did a deal with the Army Corps of Engineers, which uses tens ofthousands of PCs.andP;  And we're starting to see Macintoshes.andP;  People are movingto PCs as they get into things where they need more graphics.andM;This is a great benefit to us.andP;  It doesn't matter what hardware they choose,because there is no way we aren't going to run on it.andM;We have even signed an agreement with Cray Research Inc. to begindistributing Oracle on Cray machines.andM;We're now running on 93 different hardware systems.andM;GCN: What new technology is coming from Oracle?andM;WILSON: We think there will be a lot of changes as the government moves toUnix.andM;We think NCube [a Beaverton, Ore., company that sell multiprocessors] is thewave of the future.andP;  That technology is going to be so cost-effective thatthe government will find it very attractive.andM;So we're putting a lot of research into how we can be there when the marketis ready and when the government realizes the great cost-benefits with allthe cuts going on.andM;GCN: What are your thoughts about the proliferation of microcomputer localarea networks in government?andM;WILSON: We have a relationship with preferred systems integrators.andP;  We havesigned seven of the top 12 LAN integrators already, including Computerland,Sears and Businessland.andP;  We're using them because they know how to implementLAN products.andM;There are so many micro LANs and servers that people have difficulty tryingto figure out how to tie these things together.andM;We are better off dealing specifically with LAN professionals who know thatbusiness.andM;GCN: What is Oracle's reason for not submitting to third-party benchmarkingof your Unix versions by Neal Nelson Associates or computer publications?andM;WILSON: I'm not aware that we have ever passed up a benchmarking opportunity.andM;GCN: Why do you have a clause in your license agreement that prevents anyonelicensed from publishing benchmark results?andM;WILSON: Because we want to be involved in evaluating those benchmarks to besure they are done appropriately and are not put out in a bad light.andO;Benchmarks can be done well or poorly depending on who is doing them.andP;  Thereare so many different kinds of benchmarks that you have to make sure tocompare apples to apples.andM;We want to be very careful that people don't give out erroneous data.andP;  Ifsomeone wants a benchmark, they surely can have one, and if someone wants tosee audited benchmark results, we'll surely provide them.andM;But we're not going to put ourselves in the position of having somebody doingthe benchmark and publishing results that may not be valid.andP;  There are noplans to reverse that.andM;GCN: How do you compare in the government marketplace with other industryleaders?andM;WILSON: I would suspect we're probably larger than any two of our competitorscombined in the government marketplace.andP;  We did more revenue this year in thefederal marketplace than Sybase Inc. did as a company.andP;  We're probably fivetimes the size of Ingres Corp. in the federal government.andM;The reason is that we have made the commitment to the federal government,with more than 300 people for the federal marketplace.andP;  That's more thanSybase has as a company.andM;Also, ours is the only software that runs across all these platforms.andM;The only two companies that truly could compete with us are Digital EquipmentCorp. and IBM.andP;  They are the only ones with the financial wherewithal tospend money on research and development and build financial applications.andO;Sybase and Informix Software Inc. and the others can't do that.andP;  DEC and IBMcan't do it because they are committed to their own architectures.andM;GCN: What are Oracle's current market share and revenue in the governmentdatabase management system market?andM;WILSON: In the last four years, the federal group has grown from $4 millionto more than $75 million this past year.andP;  Federal revenues were about 10percent of overall company revenues.andP;  I plan to do $150 million this year, orabout 11 percent of Oracle's total revenues.andM;Our fourth-quarter company revenues were up from $216 million last year to$334 million, and our net income increased 58 percent.andM;Our fiscal 1990 revenues were $971 million.andM;GCN: Some say your pricing is too high compared with some of the others.andM;WILSON: Having dealt both inside and outside Oracle, I know that othersoftware companies place their pricing close to Oracle and map Oracle'sincreases.andP;  If our prices appear higher than some of our competitors', itprobably is because we perceive our value to be bigger.andM;GCN: Oracle recently announced an interface to Wang Laboratories Inc.'sIntegrated Image System so VS users can build applications to integrate withSQL Forms.andP;  It also announced Oracle Government Financials on RISC/Ultrix andDEC's VAX/VMS system.andM;Are there other announcements coming down the line?andM;WILSON: We are working with Pyramid Technology Corp., Sequent ComputerSystems Inc. and Hewlett-Packard Co. in the area of security.andP;  We're workingon having the database pass government compliance.andP;  We expect to have fourplatforms at the B1 level of security by November.andM;We also are trying to come up with imaging systems for both federal and stategovernments.andP;  We are working with Oracle Complex Systems Corp., Wang and DataGeneral Corp.andM;GCN: What are your plans for the federal marketing division of Oracle?andM;WILSON: I believe we currently are the most successful software company inthe federal market.andM;I intend to increase the percentage of dominance by Oracle, and thepercentage of federal compared to the rest of the organization.andM;We have never taken advantage of the government marketplace outside thecontinental United States.andM;There are opportunities all over Germany and France -- military bases, theAgriculture Department, the Immigration and Naturalization Service and othersoverseas.andM;We believe in total quality management.andP;  We are positioning ourselves toimprove our quality and we intend to win the Malcolm Baldridge award fortotal quality management within three years.andM;Instead of being evaluated this year on how much product they can get out thedoor, our developers are being evaluated on a matrix involving productdelivery, acceptance and quality.andM;We also have made a concerted effort to reduce the time from when a bug isannounced to when it is fixed.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
