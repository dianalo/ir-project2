The AD requires initial and repetitivereplacement of the FMU with new or serviceable units, at intervals notto exceed 150 FMU operating hours. AD action was necessary to prevent theinability to reduce engine thrust caused by angular separation betweenthe sector gears and metering valve feedback shaft in the FMU. There hasbeen one event where excessive wear in the FMU resolver pinion and sectorgears has caused temporary seizure of the gears and angular separationto occur between the sector gears and metering valve feedback shaft. Angularseparation between the sector gears and metering valve feedback shaft inducesan understated full flow signal to the electronic engine control (EEC).The understated fuel flow signal to the EEC results in convergence of theengine operating line and minimum ratio units fuel schedule controlledby the EEC, thereby precluding subsequent power reduction. In a recentservice incident, during landing roll, engine power could not be reducedafter the reversers were stowed, thereby causing an asymmetric thrust conditionand aircraft directional control problems during the subsequent rollout.Since it was found that immediate corrective action was required, noticeand public procedure thereon were impracticable and contrary to publicinterest, and good cause existed to make the AD effective immediately byindividual telegrams issued February 3, 1988, to all known U.S. ownersand operators of certain PW4152 engines installed in Airbus Industrie A310-300series aircraft. These conditions still exist, and the AD is hereby publishedin the <T4>Federal Register</T4> as an amendment to andSection; 39.13 of Part 39of the Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR) to make it effective as to allpersons. The regulations adopted herein do not have substantial direct effects onthe States, on the relationship between the national government and theStates, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among thevarious levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order12612, it is determined that this final rule does not have sufficient federalismimplications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. The FAA has determined that this regulation is an emergency regulationthat is not considered to be major under Executive Order 12291. It is impracticablefor the agency to follow the procedures of Executive Order 12291 with respectto this rule since the rule must be issued immediately to correct an unsafecondition in aircraft. It has been further determined that this actioninvolves an emergency regulation under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures(44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979). If this action is subsequently determinedto involve a significant/major regulation, a final regulatory evaluationor analysis, as appropriate, will be prepared and placed in the regulatorydocket (otherwise, an evaluation or analysis is not required).
