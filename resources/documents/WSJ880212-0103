Allen IV thought his zero-gravity days were over. But a White House announcement yesterday sent the former space shuttle astronaut into orbit once again.    Space Industries Inc., which Mr. Allen serves as executive vice president and all-around promoter, is by far the biggest potential winner in the new space-development policy launched by President Reagan at an afternoon news conference. As part of the program, the White House called for bids on a $700 million, five-year contract to develop an orbiting space station -- a contract on which Space Industries has a virtual lock.    &quot;It's a red letter day for the space community,&quot; Mr. Allen said -- and for no company more so than his own. &quot;It is indeed a significant milestone in Space Industries' development.&quot;    The ebullient, 50-year-old Mr. Allen, a physicist, is one of but six principals in Space Industries. The company's most noted leader is Maxime A. Faget, the president and chief executive officer, who helped to design Mercury, Gemini, Apollo and shuttle spacecraft. But in a business that is dominated by federal bureaucracy and that isn't exactly brimming with venture capital, Mr. Allen has taken the lead as fund-raiser, congressional liaison, engineer and head cheerleader.    He has also used his considerable clout in the space community to maintain Space Industries' hard-won spot on the shuttle manifest. This has ensured the private space station of passage into space even though most commercial projects have been pushed aside by military projects in the wake of the Challenger space shuttle explosion.    Mr. Allen traces his involvement with the private space station to 1974, when he took part in a massive space agency study. The mission was determining what the National Aeronautics and Space Administration should be doing at the turn of the century. The study group recommended building an &quot;outpost&quot; in space, and Mr. Allen, was intrigued.    Nine years later -- while still working as a space shuttle astronaut -- Mr. Allen began moonlighting with a small group of engineers who had the off-the-wall idea of launching a scaled-down, privately owned version of just such an outpost. Working in a tiny office suite just outside Houston, Mr. Allen and the others conceived of what they call the Industrial Space Facility -- a man-tended, zero-gravity laboratory and manufacturing plant.    &quot;I thought it was a long shot at best,&quot; he recalls. But, &quot;the boldness of this project appealed to me to no end.&quot;    Mr. Allen is retired from NASA, but he considers his corporate calling as every bit the adventure of his years at the agency. He served as a mission scientist for the Apollo 15 voyage and was a mission specialist on two successful shuttle flights -- the first to carry cargo to space, and later the first to retrieve an errant satellite -- the Westar VI, owned by Western Union Corp.    At Space Industries, his duties call for different strengths -- and shirt -- sleeves instead of space suits. &quot;I think the astronaut business is one that young people can do better,&quot; he says, &quot;but the wisdom you can apply elsewhere.&quot;    Mr. Allen has already presided over the negotiations with aerospace companies that will complete Space Industries' design, build the complex docking system and solar-power collectors and handle other jobs -- making Space Industries surely one of the smallest companies ever to sign up Westinghouse Electric Corp., Boeing Co. and Lockheed Corp. as sub-contractors.    But although it was privately organized and capitalized (with help from Inverness Securities Corp., a Houston investment-banking concern), Space Industries knew it needed a government-sized financial payload. Mr. Allen has explored a wide range of potential contracts with major corporations and government wishing to conduct research in space, from McDonnell Douglas Corp. to the Pentagon.    The potential contract announced yesterday, however, would seem to solve Space Industries' money worries. It so happens that the $700 million contract value estimated by the White House -- to lease space for the government aboard a space station -- represents the total investment that Space Industries has determined will be necessary to design and build the station, launch it aboard the shuttle and accumulate an inventory of spare parts.    Just the same, if the contract falls through and Space Industries can't find the a big customer elsewhere, it will prove itself no different from any other capitalist enterprise.    Says Mr. Allen, who helped raise the company's $30 million in funds: &quot;You've got private capital at risk.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
