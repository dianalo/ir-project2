She can tell at aglance if a handbag is cobra or crocodile, python or plastic. Nor isshe cowed by rawhide vs. Naugahyde, boa vs. bogus.   As the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service inspector at HartsfieldAtlanta International Airport, Carol Carson supervises the shipmentof wild animals, checks fish bound for restaurants, sees thatleather goods are properly imported and makes sure that endangeredspecies or items made from them are not allowed into the country.   If an item comes from an endangered species, such as thehawksbill turtle or white leopard, she doesn't monkey around. Theitem is confiscated, and the worst offenders can receive up to ayear in prison and a $20,000 fine.   Some travelers who have their souvenirs taken away submitquietly. Others have ``made me glad I had a customs inspectorstanding next to me and that he was armed,'' Ms. Carson said.   She rides herd on hunting trophies from an African safari beingshipped to a taxidermist in Birmingham, Ala., rare monkeys beingexchanged by zoos for breeding, and European salmon headed for someof the Southeast's finest restaurants.   For her territory _ the Southeast with the exception of Miami _Ms. Carson inspects products ranging from Italy's smartest leatherclothing and accessories to ``cheap junk, tanned so badly it willstart to smell in a few weeks.''   A big day was the interception of 100 illegal elephant tusks.This day's haul, though, included cheap items sent from Nigeria toan address in the Atlanta suburb of College Park.   Seated on plastic trash bags spread on the floor of the KLM RoyalDutch Airlines freight terminal, Ms. Carson cataloged and counted agrowing pile of purses, wallets and briefcases made of variousreptile hides.   A glance told her whether it was cobra or monitor lizard. Some,however, weren't that easy. Her fingers probed the trim on adrawstring purse.   ``It's fake,'' she finally said, grinning. ``It's trimmed in fakealligator.'' Fake is legal.   But she confiscated 239 items that didn't have proper permits orwere made from monitor lizards, whose skins cannot be brought intothe United States under the Endangered Species Act.   The rest of the shipment was either cowhide items or Africangarments colored with cheap vegetable dye. The clothing was possiblyillegal because of import quotas for textiles, but that was a matterfor the Customs Service.   Buried in a second shipment of cloth items and bags of shreddedgrass were two 12-foot python hides, two cobra skins, two antelopehides, five snakeskin handbags, three pairs of lizard shoes and theskin of a civet, a cat-like creature.   The bags of confiscated goods made a pile in the back of the vanwith a ``Lizard Lady'' plate on the front.   ``The international mechanics at Delta tagged me with that namewhen I first got here,'' Ms. Carson said.   A college wildlife major and onetime zoo volunteer, Ms. Carsonjoined the Fish and Wildlife Service as a secretary. When theservice decided to put an inspector at Hartsfield four years ago,``I was the only one around with a biology background who wantedit.''   ``I like the (Lizard Lady) designation now,'' she said. ``Itkeeps me high profile. Customs, the Agriculture Department, theairlines, they know who I am, that I am here. I'm sure I'm listed insome Rolodexes as Lizard Lady.''</TEXT></DOC>
