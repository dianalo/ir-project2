As a mid-level Justice Department official during the height of the Vietnam War, his no-nonsense prosecution of draft evaders caught the attention of the Nixon White House. As a U.S. attorney and most recently as chief judge of the Federal District Court in San Antonio, Texas, Mr. Sessions honed his reputation as an advocate for stiff jail sentences and as a stickler for detail and courtroom decorum.    But behind his self-described image as a &quot;West Texas tough guy,&quot; fellow judges, prosecutors and defense attorneys regard the silverhaired, 57-year-old Judge Sessions as a careful and scrupulously fair decision maker, and as a proven manager whose ramrod-straight bearing and sensitivity to public perceptions has won the respect of many critics.    That combination of conservatism and personal integrity is one of the main reasons that Mr. Reagan and Attorney General Edwin Meese turned to Judge Sessions to lead the FBI. And, while the Democratic-controlled Senate is expected to question Judge Sessions closely and probe into controversial parts of his background, there is strong bipartisan feeling on Capitol Hill that his nomination isn't likely to meet much opposition.    &quot;He's a law-and-order judge&quot; who doesn't carry the baggage of a close association with Mr. Meese or the rest of the Reagan administration, according to Sen. Lloyd Bentsen (D., Texas). Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd (D., W.Va.) praised the judge's reputation as &quot;particularly&quot; tough against drug offenders.    At a news conference after the White House announcement last Friday, Mr. Meese said Judge Sessions' &quot;character and his career performance strongly indicate that he will approach his work in the nonpartisan manner that is demanded by this very sensitive position.&quot;    Judge Sessions is slated to take over at a turning point in the FBI's history. Under former Director William Webster, who earlier this year became head of the Central Intelligence Agency, the bureau took on broad responsibilities in fighting drug trafficking, white-collar crime and terrorism, while improving its public image and developing good relations with Congress.    The next director, however, will have to make difficult choices about allocating scarce investigative resources and maintaining a tight rein over FBI use of increasingly sophisticated electronic eavesdropping and computer technologies that threaten personal privacy.    Moreover, the FBI and some of its top officials have been hurt by disclosures related to the Iran-Contra scandal. Critics contend that the bureau failed to aggressively investigate Lt. Col. Oliver North's early activities in Central America, and that senior FBI officials were manipulated and dissuaded from following clues that could have uncovered improper or illegal National Security Council operations.    Judge Sessions, described as reserved and even &quot;straight-laced&quot; by some acquaintances, has made his reputation as an effective manager rather than a legal scholar. He attracted national prominence in the early 1980s, when he presided over trials of conspirators in the assassination of a Texas federal judge.    Federal appeals court Judge Thomas Gee of Houston, who reviewed the 127-volume record in the case before rejecting appeals from those who were convicted, called Judge Sessions' performance &quot;a magnificent tour de force.&quot; Patrick Higginbotham, a federal appeals court judge who has known Judge Sessions since the mid-1970s, said he is &quot;a man of courage and integrity&quot; who &quot;sits tall under pressure.&quot;    An avid outdoorsman and mountain climber who has gone halfway up Mt. Everest, Judge Sessions applied unsuccessfully last year to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration to become the first judge to ride in space.    Judge Sessions was a minister's son who married his wife Alice while both of them were in high school, and he attended college at night before getting his law degree. His initial worries about accepting the FBI nomination, according to some friends and acquaintances, included concerns about disrupting the low-key, family-oriented life style he has prized over the years.    Critics are expected to focus on the judge's rulings that restricted press access to jurors under some circumstances, along with his early work as a federal prosecutor in several pornography and voter-fraud cases.    &quot;I cannot remember when a citizen's personal rights were expanded&quot; by a precedent-setting ruling issued by Judge Sessions, local civil rights leader Jerry Goldstein told a San Antonio newspaper recently. &quot;But I would rather try a case before him than any other judge.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
