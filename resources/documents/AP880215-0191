Titled ``The Informal Economy: Studies in Advanced and LessDeveloped Countries,'' it includes essays by 19 authors from Italy,Spain, Uruguay and Bolivia as well as the United States.   One author estimates the size of the underground economy at 4.4percent, another 10 percent, another 33 percent of totalproduction. The size also varies by place and industry.   ``Negative consequences of the (underground) process are endurednot only by workers _ who must cope with low wages, insecure jobsand lack of occupational safeguards _ but also by entireindustries,'' they say.   Bolivian cocaine processors, Soviet vodka distillers andthousands of New York unregistered cabdrivers are all consideredpart of a growing underground world economy that the says skewsstatistics as well as producing huge unreported and untaxed profits.   Whatever the amount, the underground activity rarely if evershows up on the official statistics used by nations and worldorganizations in making crucial economic policy decisions.   A decade ago the size of the underground economy in New YorkCity alone was estimated at more than $16 billion.   Saskia Sassen-Koob, director of the urban planning program atColumbia University's Graduate School of Architecture and Planning,says a survey in 1981 of four blocks in Manhattan found 90 percentof all interior construction being done without permits. Sheestimates that there are 21,000 ``gypsy'' taxicabs not licensed bythe city, twice the number of legal cabs.   A study based on a survey of 1,000 recent Soviet immigrants tothe United States estimates that in Soviet cities of the late1970s, 40 percent of the households received more than a quarter oftheir income from ``informal'' activities. These ranged fromdistilling vodka to market gardening, and from bootleg medicalservices to repairing private cars with parts stolen fromgovernment garages, according to former residents.   In Latin America about 40 percent of the workforce is believedto be ``informally'' employed, the editors say.</TEXT></DOC>
