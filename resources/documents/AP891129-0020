James Hansen, a researcher at NASA's Institute for SpaceStudies, said that chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs, make up about 25percent of the so-called ``greenhouse gases'' thought to be causingthe Earth to slowly heat up.   But if production of CFCs had not been reduced in 1974, he saidTuesday, the compound by now would have made up more than half ofthe greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and the planet would beheating faster.   ``If the growth of CFC production in the early 1970s hadcontinued to date,'' Hansen says in a paper published in Journal ofGeophysical Research, ``the CFCs would now cause a much largergreenhouse effect, greater than that for CO2 (carbon dioxide).''   In an interview, Hansen said that with an unchecked use of CFCs,``we would get to the large climate changes caused by greenhouseforcing (or heating) in 20 years rather than in 40 years as mostmodels (theories) now predict. The CFCs would provide a forcing atleast as large as CO2.''   The greenhouse heating effect of CFCs would be three timeslarger now if production of the chemical had not been reduced inthe 1970s, Hansen said.   CFCs once were used as a propellant in cans of such products ashair spray, paint and household cleaners. When studies showed thatthe chemical compound could harm the atmosphere, the use of CFCs asa propellant was stopped in the United States, Canada and in someEuropean countries. Starting in 1974, there was a sharp reductionin the production of CFCs.   The chemical, however, continues to be used as a refrigerant andin some industrial applications.   In addition to contributing to the greenhouse heating of theatmosphere, some CFCs also cause a depletion in the ozone layer ofthe stratosphere. High level ozone blocks solar ultraviolet rays, aprinciple cause of skin cancer. As a result of this ozone problem,the United States and some other nations have agreed to stopproduction of some CFCs in the 1990s and to develop other chemicalcompounds to use as refrigerants.   Hansen said that manmade gases, principally carbon dioxide, inthe atmosphere are thought to have caused the Earth to retain anadditional 2 watts of heat energy per square meter since 1890.   He and other scientists predict that this heat retention willincrease to about 4 watts per square meter in about four decades ifthe rate of carbon dioxide dumped into the atmosphere by humanactivities continues at its present, increasing rate.   Exactly how and when this will affect the Earth's temperature isa matter of controversy, Hansen said, ``because of the uncertaintyin climate sensitivity.''   But some experts have expressed fears that increasing thetemperature of the Earth by only a few degrees could force a risein ocean levels and seriously affect food production by changingthe climate in major farm areas.   The greenhouse effect is caused by atmospheric gases that actrather like a blanket by keeping heat from radiating from the Earthinto space. This could gradually force the globe to warm.   Carbon dioxide, the principle greenhouse gas, is produced bycombustion, such as in the burning of oil, gas, coal and wood.</TEXT></DOC>
