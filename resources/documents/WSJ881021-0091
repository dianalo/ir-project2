Drug industry officials generally applauded the FDA's announcement on Wednesday of the policy change, which had been in the works for much of the year and widely anticipated by drug companies. But some company executives and FDA watchers viewed the new policy with caution and skepticism, saying that previous streamlining efforts by the agency had failed to meet expectations.    Under the plan, the FDA said it will implement a program in which drugs for life-threatening illnesses and irreversible health problems can be evaluated for safety and effectiveness based on smaller and shorter human studies than presently required. Drug companies and the FDA must design studies aimed at producing these earlier results. Drugs approved this way would then be more closely monitored for potential problems once in use by doctors.    Kenneth Berkowitz, a vice president at Hoffmann-La Roche Inc., the U.S. unit of the Swiss drug and chemical giant, F. Hoffmann-La Roche andamp; Co., said the drug industry sees the proposal to quicken the approval as part of the agency's recent efforts under Commissioner Frank Young to &quot;expedite&quot; the flow of new drugs. Mr. Berkowitz and others said they hoped that if the faster release policy worked it could be extended to the approval of drugs for treating arthritis and heart disease, a process that currently can take years.    Several drug company executives expressed concern, however, that if a new commissioner were to be named by the next president, streamlining efforts might stall. &quot;The bureaucracy at the agency needs Young's strong hand to keep them convinced that some drugs can get out fast,&quot; said one drug company official.    Several industry analysts were dubious about how often the FDA and the drug companies would use the new rules. Sarah Gordon, an analyst at Hambrecht andamp; Quist, said, &quot;Previous proposals have been more talk than action.&quot; She noted that a program highly touted last year by the FDA to release some drugs before studies were completed had caused the early release of only one drug, a treatment for a type of pneumonia caused by the acquired immune deficiency syndrome virus.    Also, Ms. Gordon said, some companies might not want to participate in the new program. They have told her that the monitoring requirements under the new plan might actually be more difficult and expensive than doing lengthier studies prior to approval.    Nancy Buc, a drug industry lawyer in Washington, D.C., said many drugs for such diseases as cancer often have &quot;subtle effects that only show up after very large trials.&quot; Ms. Buc, a partner at Weil Gotschal andamp; Manges, said the FDA already can approve drugs based on early results, but that &quot;few early tests ever show approvable results.&quot; Her clients, she said, may be disappointed.    But FDA staffers said several drugs still under study could have benefited from the new approach. Ganciclovir, a drug for treating an AIDS-related infection, &quot;could be widely available if the first tests done on it were better designed,&quot; said an FDA official. Syntex Corp. of Palo Alto, Calif. is testing the drug; officials there couldn't be reached for comment.    Some activists who have pushed for FDA reform said the new rules don't go far enough. &quot;I think its crazy this program is voluntary,&quot; said Barry Gingell of the Gay Men's Health Crisis. &quot;Companies should be required by law to design streamlined studies.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
