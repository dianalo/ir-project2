Francis L. Young recommended reclassifying marijuana as aSchedule II drug so that it could be prescribed by physicians totreat the often severe nausea accompanying chemotherapy as well asmuscle spasms caused by multiple sclerosis.   Young, whose findings are not binding on DEA's head, John Lawn,acknowledged that ``strong emotions are aroused on both sides ofany discussion concerning the use of marijuana.''   ``Nonetheless it is essential for this agency, and itsadministrator, calmly and dispassionately to review the evidence ofrecord, correctly to apply the law, and act accordingly,'' he wrotein an opinion released Tuesday.   Young rejected as ``specious'' the argument that prescribingmarijuana cigarettes as a medicine ``will `send a signal' thatmarijuana is OK generally for recreational use.''   ``The fear of sending such a signal cannot be permitted tooverride the legitimate need, amply demonstrated in this record, ofcountless sufferers for the relief marijuana can provide whenprescribed by a physician in a legitimate case.''   Young cited testimony by doctors and patients during 11 days ofhearings that marijuana was an accepted and effective treatment fornausea among cancer patients and for multiple sclerosis, adebilitating and crippling neurological disease.   The hearings were ordered in 1980 by the U.S. Circuit Court ofAppeals here, which chastised DEA for ignoring its statutoryobligation to consider evidence that marijuana might have somemedical benefit.   The appellate court had twice previously overruled DEA'srejection of petitions, first filed in 1972, by the NationalOrganization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws (NORML).   The group's attorney, Kevin B. Zeese, vowed to take the caseback to the court if Lawn or his successor rejects Young'srecommendation.   DEA has historically opposed moving marijuana from the list ofSchedule I drugs, which includes heroin, PCP and LSD, to ScheduleII.   DEA spokesman Cornelius Dougherty said Lawn ``won't have anycomment until he has had a chance to look at'' Young's 68-pageopinion.   Dougherty said Lawn could opt to hold further hearings beforemaking a final decision.   Zeese hailed Young's decision, saying it marks ``the first timethere has ever been an unbiased hearing on whether or not marijuanais safe for use under medical supervision.''   ``It's a very important step in the process,'' Zeese said.   Even if DEA upholds Young's findings, the Food and DrugAdministration and state regulatory agencies would have to passjudgment before marijuana were made available as a drug.   Young determined that smoking marijuana was more effective atcontrolling nausea from chemotherapy than capsules that contain thesynthetic THC, the chemically active ingredient of cannabis.   When smoked, ``natural marijuana is inhaled and generally takeseffect more quickly than the synthetic capsule which is ingestedand must be processed through the digestive system before it takeseffect,'' Young said.   He also cited a seven-year experiment by at least 10 hospitalsin New Mexico that showed marijuana cigarettes were ``highlyeffective'' in controlling nausea after chemotherapy. Thecigarettes were supplied by the federal government underregulations that allow medical research.   Efforts by Louisiana at making marijuana a prescription drug forcancer patients were frustrated by the insistence of federalauthorities that it would only be made available as part of aresearch project, Young said.   Few doctors were willing to file the required paperwork toparticipate under those conditions, he said.   Young also rejected DEA contentions that marijuana was notproven a safe drug, saying: ``by any measure of rational analysis,marijuana can be safely used within a supervised routine of medicalcare.''   ``Marijuana can be harmful. Marijuana is abused. But the same istrue of dozens of drugs or substances which are listed in ScheduleII so that they can be employed in treatment by physicians inproper cases, despite their abuse potential,'' he said.   In the case of multiple sclerosis, there are few drugs to treatmuscle spasms and they often cause serious side effects, Young said.   Marijuana was also found to be an accepted and effectivetreatment of painful bone spurs caused by pseudo hypoparathyroidism.   Young said there was insufficient evidence that a ``respectableminority of physicians'' had accepted marijuana as a treatment forglaucoma, a degenerative optic-nerve disease that slowly causesblindness.   But he did note that ``two highly qualified and experiencedophthalmologists'' accepted marijuana's medical value for treatingthe disease.   As with multiple sclerosis, there are only a limited number ofother drugs to treat glaucoma, and they can cause serious sideeffects, Young said.</TEXT></DOC>
