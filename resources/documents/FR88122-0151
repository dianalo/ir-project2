Thelength of the connector is approximately 2.0 miles. The northern terminusand study area limit will be the northernmost end of the proposed rampsor mainline connecting I-176, south of the Shiloh Road overpass. The southernterminus and study area limit will be the connector with the proposed TurnpikeInterchange andplusmin;22, and PA Route 10. The project area will also includeproposed ramps to Mineview Drive (T-333) and Mineview Drive reconstructionbetween PA Route 10 and T-306.Alternates under consideration include: (1) No action; and (2) the constructionof a four-lane limited access connector between I-176 and Turnpike Interchangeandplusmin;22.
