ROSENBERG</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE><TEXT>   A post-Thanksgiving pickup in sales by the nation's biggestgeneral retailers is a positive sign for the important Christmasshopping season, industry watchers say, even though sales for all ofNovember were sluggish.   Sales tallied after the November reporting period _ which endedNov. 26 for most retailers _ showed modest improvement, ``leading usto the general conclusion that Christmas sales will be reasonablyhealthy,'' said Jeffrey Feiner, a retail industry analyst withMerrill Lynch andamp; Co.   ``Based on the end-of-the-month results, one could project we'regoing to have a moderately strong Christmas season,'' said WalterLoeb, an analyst with Morgan Stanley andamp; Co. Inc.   Retailers earn about half their annual profits during the crucialholiday period. But even if sales are slow, profits should improvein the fourth quarter because retailers are keeping theirinventories tight, Ronning said.   Many analysts predict retailers will have a 6 percent overallincrease in Christmas sales from last year. But Joseph Ronning, ananalyst with Brown Brothers Harriman Inc., warned that the salesimprovement might look better than it really is because results lastChristmas were disappointing.   November's sales ``were on the sluggish side, very similar to thetrends we saw in September and October,'' said Jeffrey Edelman, ananalyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. ``The first 3{ weeks werequite soft.''   Retailers have had slumping sales for nearly two years asconsumers have paid more for necessities and services and tried toreduce their high debt loads. Analysts and economists expect thistrend to continue into 1989.   Apparel retailers, who have had a year-long sales slide,continued their comeback last month. For example, Limited Inc., aleading specialty apparel retailer, reported its overall Novembersales rose 25 percent while sales at stores open at least a year _known as same-store sales _ picked up 18 percent.   The nation's largest retailer, Sears, Roebuck and Co., said itsoverall sales were up 8.8 percent last month and 6.2 percent for thefirst 43 weeks of the fiscal year. Sears' same-store sales rose 4.4percent in November and 2.3 percent for the year so far.   Retailers and industry analysts believe same-store sales are amore accurate measure of a company's performance than figures thatinclude sales from new stores. Not all retailers report same-storesales.   K mart Corp. said its overall sales were up 5.5 percent lastmonth and 5.6 percent for the year to date. K mart reported itssame-store sales rose 1.4 percent for the month and 1.9 percent sofar this year.   K mart's reporting period ended Nov. 23, so its sales report didnot reflect the beginning of the traditional Christmas season on theday after Thanksgiving.   Wal-Mart Stores Inc. said its overall sales rose 30 percentduring November and 29 percent so far in 1988. The discountretailer's same-store sales were up 13 percent for the month and 11percent for the year to date.   J.C. Penney Co. Inc. said its overall sales fell 1.8 percentduring the month and were up just 0.1 percent over the cumulative43-week period. Penney's same-store sales were off 3.8 percentduring November, and slipped 1.1 percent for the year to date.   Karen Sack, an analyst with Standard andamp; Poor's Corp., said thedecline in Penney's sales reflected the fact that the company haddiscontinued several merchandise lines over the past year. Penneysaid it would have recorded a gain if sales from discontinued itemswere excluded from year-earlier results.   Dayton Hudson Corp. reported its overall sales picked up 7percent during November and 14.8 percent over the 43-week period.The company reported same-store increases of 1.5 percent for themonth and 1.7 percent for 43 weeks.   May Department Stores Co. said its overall sales rose 19.7percent last month and 16 percent for the year to date. Same-storesales rose 2.8 percent in November and 1.9 percent for the year sofar.   F.W. Woolworth Co. said its overall sales picked up 9.3 percentlast month and 11.8 percent during the 43-week period. Same-storesales rose 4.8 percent in November and 5.8 percent for the year todate.   Montgomery Ward andamp; Co. said its sales were up 7.8 percent inNovember and 3.7 percent for the 43 weeks.   Sales for several of the big retailers continued to run wellunder the rate of inflation, which has increased by 4.6 percent sofar this year.   The results reported were from the biggest general merchandiseand apparel retailers. Unlike monthly retail sales figures releasedby the federal government, they do not include sales at autodealers, supermarkets or restaurants.</TEXT></DOC>
