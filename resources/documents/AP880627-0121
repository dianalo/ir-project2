The SEC filed a civil complaint against Stephen Wang Jr., ananalyst in Morgan Stanley's mergers and acquisitions department.   The complaint asked the federal court in New York to order thereturn of $19 million in alleged trading profits plus triple thatamount in damages.   Gary Lynch, the SEC's enforcement chief, said the case is thesecond biggest insider trading case ever handled by the SEC,dwarfed only by a case brought in late 1986 against Ivan Boesky.   Also named in the complaint was Fred C. Lee, a Hong Kongbusinessman who allegedly traded on the information supplied byWang.   Wang had been with Morgan Stanley for two years and had been inthe mergers and acquisition division for one year, Lynch said in aninterview.   ``Over the course of the last year, we allege that he funnelledinformation to Fred Lee, who then traded on that information,''Lynch said.   Investigators alleged in the complaint that Lee had attempted tomove money out of the United States and for that reason funds inbank accounts should be frozen.   Lynch said that investigators are alleging that the trading oninside information involved stock in about 25 different companiesincluding E.F. Hutton, Stop andamp; Shop Cos. and Utah Power andamp; Light Co.   Morgan Stanley said in a brief statement that it had suspendedWang pending an investigation. A source at Morgan Stanley, whospoke on condition of anonymity, said the firm had been cooperatingwith SEC officials for some time in connection with Wang'sactivities.   Wang, 24, was a junior analyst on a two-year training programfor college graduates, the source said. He was only months awayfrom completing the program when the SEC announced its actionagainst him.   The SEC complaint against Boesky was filed in November 1986.Boesky paid the SEC a record $100 million to settle civil chargesthat he traded stocks on the basis of insider information providedto him by Dennis B. Levine, a former investment banker at DrexelBurnham Lambert Inc.   Both Boesky and Levine are serving sentences in minimum securityfederal prisons.   The SEC complaint against Wang and Lee, who is a Taiwan citizen,comes after a House investigating committee charged earlier in themonth that the SEC was not doing enough to pursue insider tradingby foreigners.   A subcommittee of the House Government Operations Committeee hadcharged that insider trading by foreigners was growing as tradersbecame more sophisticated in cloaking their identity by purchasingU.S. stock through overseas banks.   But SEC Chairman David Ruder had defended his agency's handlingof investigations involving foreigners, saying the SEC had madesubstantial progress in coordinating investigations with othercountries.</TEXT></DOC>
