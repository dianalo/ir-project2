<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-79-0618 </DOCNO><TEXT>The future accelerator facilities of GSI, a heavy ion synchrotron (SIS)and a storage cooler ring (ESR) are described. With the combination ofthese rings heavy ion and radioactive beams will be produced with energiesup to 1-2 GeV/u at the highest possible phase space densities. Firstbeams are expected in 1989. A number of proposed experiments and experimentalfacilities are described. Various medium energy nucleus-nucleus collisionexperiments are planned to study nuclei at high excitation energy. Radioactivebeams are produced using projectile fragmentation, followed by isotopeseparation. They can be accumulated and cooled in ESR and made availablefor various nuclear structure experiments.</TEXT></DOC>
