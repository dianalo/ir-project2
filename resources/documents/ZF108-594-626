 And it'sready to serve the average computer user in the comfort of his home.andM;Like its challengers, GEnie and Alex, Suzy is hoping to become a householdname.andM;Giving systems a name is a tactic that is successfully shifting on-linesystems away from the domain of librarians and information specialists aloneand into lives of the average computer user.andM;&quot;I think it's great,&quot; says Ulla de Stricker, communications manager forMicromedia Ltd. of Toronto, and co-author of Business Online: A CanadianGuide.andP;  &quot;I think that the challenge for consumer-oriented services lies ingetting people to feel comfortable and getting them to think of it as thenatural thing as opposed to something exotic.&quot;andM;And by creating &quot;non-threatening&quot; names, the industry is making its pointthat on-line services don't have to be hard to use, she says.andM;&quot;I'm an on-line junkie,&quot; admits Alex Morton, president of Stratford SoftwareCorp. of Burnaby, B.C., which designs Suzy.andP;  &quot;I've used every on-line systemand the biggest flaw is that they've been all too difficult to navigatethrough.&quot;andM;That's why in Suzy, for example, Stratford has created something &quot;thatanybody can use,&quot; he says.andM;&quot;We did it partly by working with a group of data testers who were notcomputer wizards and knew nothing about on-line systems.andP;  We designed thesystems for all of them to be able to use without even picking up themanual.&quot;andM;Morton quips that the manual that comes with Suzy is there to make the boxheavier.andM;Stratford, formerly known as Bedford Software Ltd., started shipping its Suzysoftware late in April of this year.andM;Suzy retails for $29.95, and a user has to pay a fee of $10 or $12 an hour(depending on the time) each time the software is used to retrieveinformation.andM;Morton says he projects to have 50,000 users within a year.andP;  &quot;My goal is tohave a Suzy in every personal computer in Canada.&quot;andM;Anyone with a personal computer and a modem can use Suzy to call up a growingrange of information sources -- from international airline schedules to theNational Real Estate Service's catalogue of 30,000 listings.andM;Morton says the features Suzy offers are much more &quot;in depth than you'll findin Alex.andM;Alex is Bell Canada's interactive communications service for the homeavailable in Montreal and Toronto.andM;Says Morton: &quot;For instance in the stock market, we give you an instantsnapshot of what's going on, if you want to know the price of a stock youwant to know what it's trading at this minute.andP;  You don't want to know whatthe closing price was yesterday, that's all you can get in Alex.&quot;andM;Alex on the other hand offers customers a broad range of transactional andinformational services ranging from home shopping and electronic bill paymentto making car reservations.andM;Features such as the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CIBC)'s link up withthe Alex network is what makes Alex special.andM;CIBC is inviting Alex subscribers to &quot;bank by Alex&quot; by registering for LinkUpnext month.andM;Using LinkUp, CIBC customers in the London, Ont.andP;  area will be able to paybills, check the balances of their CIBC accounts and check the balance andpayment details on their Visa accounts.andM;Alex hopes to duplicate the French Minitel system in Canada.andP;  France has morethan 3.5 million Minitel terminals in use and 6,000 companies supplyingMinitel-based applications.andM;For Canada, it will be a long way before it resembles the French experience,according to de Stricker.andM;She says the Canadian culture doesn't encourage the moving out of shopping orbanking into one's home.andM;&quot;There's something about shopping and doing your banking on a terminal andfeeling less comfortable than doing it in person.andM;&quot;It took me a long time before I put my paycheque in a hole in the wall.&quot;andM;She says that in the last 15 years providing on-line services to the consumermarket has been &quot;tried and tried again with very mixed success.&quot;andP;  Morton saysthe problem has been that on-line systems have been traditionally too hardfor most people to use.andM;He agrees with de Stricker in that most on-line systems require that the userhas to go out and buy a modem.andM;&quot;If PCs were born with modems to start with, then the industry may have abetter chance,&quot; says de Stricker.andM;William Louden, general manager of GEnie -- the General Electric Network forInformation Exchange -- says that the company's philosophy is that theeasiest way to make someone adapt to a technology is &quot;to make it fun.andM;&quot;Users must be motivated to overcome technological barriers,&quot; he told anaudience at a videotex conference in Toronto last month.andM;GEnie, which became available to Canadians in June 1987, is an on-lineconsumer information service for personal computer enthusiasts that provideseverything from on-line tutoring to the traditional electronic mail and gamesprovided by most on-line systems.andM;Dave McIntosh, manager of sales support and administration with GeneralElectric Information Services Canada in Mississauga, Ont.andP;  says that GEniehas now over 200,000 subscribers in the U.S., Canada, Japan, West Germany,Switzerland and Austria.andM;&quot;The most popular areas of GEnie are the product support round tables,&quot; hesays.andP;  Round tables consist of bulletin boards, real-time conferences andlibraries of software and articles.andM;&quot;There are elements in our services that are for the business professional,but also for the PC enthusiasts.&quot;andM;In Canada, the service is available direct by modem in Toronto, Montreal,Vancouver and Calgary.andP;  A further 166 Canadian cities can access GEnie viaiNet 2000, which McIntosh says he regards as the &quot;predecessor to Alex.andM;&quot;I'd like to see GEnie in Alex,&quot; he says.andM;He says Alex is not a rival to GEnie particularly in the sense that Alex hasmore of a delivery capability.andP;  &quot;GEnie perhaps some day would be one of theservices that would be delivered in Alex.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
