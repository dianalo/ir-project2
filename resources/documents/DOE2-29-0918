Differentmethods for designing the pit slopes have been described. Back-analysisis the best means of characterising the mechanical behaviour of the rockmass, leading to different pairs (c/sub m/, phi/sub m/). In sizing asloper higher than the analysed slope, it is necessary to choose, amongstthe possible pairs (c/sub m/, phi/sub m/), the one with the minimum frictionangle. The obtained values are compared to laboratory results and classifications.9 refs., 5 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
