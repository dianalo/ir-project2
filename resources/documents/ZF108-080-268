 If &quot;information&quot; isn't on your productlisting, make a new list.andM;We used to say, &quot;Information is power.&quot;andP;  But, in the '90s, information ismore: Information is value.andP;  And effective use of information is your bestweapon for beating the competition, whether you manufacture ball bearings orfigure actuarial tables.andM;Effective use of information in today's climate is a group process.andP;  Officeautomation has traditionally focused on increasing the productivity of theindividual.andP;  Now we must empower the workgroup by providing tools to supportcollaboration and coordination among and between individuals.andM;To effectively compete in a world where information is the core of anyorganization and the workgroup is the functional model, we need a newparadigm for office computing.andM;Thus, the time has come to redefine office computing.andP;  We offer the followingdefinition: Office computing is a common set of horizontal services andapplications that enable the creation, management, dissemination, andanalysis of information across the network, as well as the communication andcoordination among members of the workgroup.andP;  These services and applicationsform a common infrastructure upon which users and vendors build specializedvertical applications.andM;This is but one example of how data has become a cash commodity.andP;  Already, wesee a proliferation in the number and the use of computer conferences (BIX,Compuserve, The Well), online data services (Dow Jones, Lexus), and CD-ROMservices (Lotus's One Source).andP;  And this trend will continue to grow,especially in view of the way the value of information is increasing in thecurrent economy.andM;Interorganizational Electronic Linkages.andP;  We will not only be accessing datafrom public/private online databases, but we will also be forging closeralliances with our suppliers and customers using technology.andP;  Electronic DataInterchange (EDI) was the first step.andP;  EDI started in the grocery, trucking,and automotive industries as a way to eliminate the piles of paperworkassociated with procuring supplies.andP;  But, besides reducing paper, EDI alsocut down on time--always a valued commodity.andM;The next logical step, which is happening to a small degree today, isallowing the parts suppliers to peek inside in-house inventory databases sothat orders can automatically be initiated when inventory runs low.andP;  Somesuppliers actually will maintain the inventory databases at their sites,allowing the client to access the database remotely.andP;  All ordering andbilling will be electronic, application to application.andM;This form of electronic connection between customers can go much further thanthe order/supply model.andP;  Even without specific EDI applications, being onlinewith customers via electronic mail is becoming quite popular.andP;  A direct lineof communication, not dependent on winning at telephone tag, can be created.andO;With a transparent system, you could send a message to your customer aseasily as sending one to your secretary.andM;Security.andP;  In this new era of data abundance and transparent access, securityis critical.andP;  With data a commodity in a world linked by electronicconnections, someone has to make sure that data is restricted to appropriateaccessors.andM;Security is required at all levels.andP;  The operating system providers mustoffer sophisticated security systems.andP;  The communications providers must dothe same.andP;  And the data providers have to work out complete sets ofpermissions.andP;  Another security-related consideration is billing for data.andO;Providers must establish billing methods based on the value of theinformation accessed rather than the amount of time it took to get it.andM;Security is every organization's concern.andP;  In order to offer the &quot;open door&quot;level of transparency that will be required in this information economy, asimilarly sophisticated system must be in place to slam certain doors shut.andM;Directories.andP;  Another pressing problem with all this data is how to find it.andO;The answer is directories.andP;  Soon, there will be directories of files,directories of objects, directories of people, directories of devices, anddirectories of directories.andP;  These directories, at least initially, will bebased on proprietary products, although they will migrate to the X.500standard when it is ready.andP;  X.500 provides a framework for directories anddirectory management that is flexible and extensible.andP;  The standard modelscomplex networks as collections of objects; each object knows about itselfand what it can do.andP;  The result is a directory structure that can be updatedto reflect new needs and changing conditions without delving into the detailsof each network object's connectivity intrinsics.andM;INCREASED CUSTOMIZATION.andP;  A major drawback to all this available data isinformation overload.andP;  All those computer conferences can add up to gigabytesof messages that you don't have the time or inclination to read.andP;  With theplethora of information available in the world today, most of us find itincreasingly difficult to wade through the material, both physical andelectronic, that lands on our desktop.andP;  And, as the world moves onlineinstead of on paper, we will see the proliferation of electronic junk mailcluttering up inboxes and wasting our time.andM;To the Rescue.andP;  Coming to our aid are a wide range of customization tools,some at the end-user level, some requiring programming by MIS or VARs.andM;* User interfaces.andP;  In the first half of the new decade, GUIs (graphical userinterfaces) will reign supreme.andP;  One of the attractions of graphical userinterfaces is that, in general, they are customizable.andP;  Icons can beredesigned and positioned anywhere on the desktop, menus can be customized,etc.andP;  Voice recognition should start playing a significant role in userinterface by 1995.andP;  While it will not permit the easy conversations seen inscience fiction movies, limited, but very useful, interaction with computerswill be voice based.andP;  Voice recognition technology has gone a long waytowards being able to recognize generic voices, no longer requiringcustomization to the individual voice.andP;  But these user interfaces willrequire customization.andP;  Systems will need to understand that when I ask for&quot;my report, please,&quot; I want a specific file in a specific location with tiesto specific tools.andM;* Filters.andP;  A filter does what you'd expect it to do.andP;  It weeds out thesuperfluous and leaves the good stuff.andP;  Filters are end-user tools, allowingthe user to specify on a list or from a menu which topics should be kept andwhich should be filtered out.andP;  An excellent example of a filter currently inuse is NewsEdge from Desktop Data Incorporated (Waltham, Massachusetts).andO;NewsEdge gives you real-time accessibility to several news services (e.g.,andO;Reuters, Dow Jones, etc.) through an FM rebroadcast (no modem orcommunications costs).andP;  But the exciting thing is the individual user profilethat flags all appropriate incoming news stories, which is based on auser-defined set of keywords.andP;  Filters can be permanent or ad hoc(single-session only).andP;  Searching can include boolean arguments, but not at asophisticated level.andP;  Other, more sophisticated filters, which make use ofartificial intelligence, are being developed in projects such as the MITObject LENS program.andM;* Macros.andP;  In some ways, macros have come a long way from stored phrases.andO;But the granddaddy of today's macro languages was Wang's glossary feature.andO;And that model is pretty consistent with the best macro languages today.andO;Macros can store keystrokes within an application.andP;  Most can store keystrokesamong applications within the same product line.andP;  Sophisticated macros canstore any keystroke sequence within a single session on the hardware.andP;  Manymacros can also be scripted, usually using an English-based syntax, butrequiring sophisticated knowledge and training.andP;  Both the captured keystrokescripts and the original scripts can be edited and can include logicalconditions and pause commands for user input.andP;  With macros, even the mostcomplex operation only needs to be done once.andP;  After that, one command canlaunch the entire procedure.andM;* Agents.andP;  Popularized--or soon to be popularized--by Hewlett-Packard'sNewWave, agents are sophisticated end-user macros that can manipulate avariety of applications.andP;  The real promise of agents is &quot;intelligence.&quot;andO;Unlike macros that run because they are explicitly launched, agents can begiven enough intelligence to determine if they should run; they can beinitiated by a command, event, or specified time.andP;  For example, agents canrespond to commands such as &quot;if corn prices drop to a certain level, create areport and send it to the appropriate personnel.&quot;andP;  Or &quot;read my calendar andlet me know 10 minutes before each appointment.&quot;andM;* Automated procedures.andP;  Just as you think of agents as automating yourpersonal tasks, you can think of procedural automation as automating groupworkflow.andP;  An automated procedure is a defined number of steps tied togetherwith conditional logic, audit trails, electronic mail, and timing factors.andO;Each step of a common business process is handled online.andP;  Electronic formsare designed that are identical to the paper forms the user is accustomed to.andO;Ties to underlying data and applications are established.andP;  (An auto insuranceclaims form, for example, can access more than one database: customerinformation and blue book prices.andP;  The first is an internal databasemaintained by the insurance company.andP;  The second is a public database.)andP;  Atappropriate points in the procedure, a document can be created from standardtext and database information.andP;  Or an electronic mail message can be sent,notifying someone of the status of the procedure.andP;  At any time, you can checkthe audit trail and see where an item is in the process.andP;  And, if a steptakes too long--if someone drops the ball--an automatic timer can notify theappropriate supervisor to ensure that action continues.andP;  At present, MIS or aVAR needs to set up the linkages in most available procedural automationtools.andP;  The actual steps, however, can be defined by an end user.andP;  Today,most users consider automated procedures as applicable only to clericaltasks--pushing paper around in a prescribed order.andP;  But, with the AI(artificial intelligence) tools that are being included in agents, proceduresthat require executive decisions can be automated.andP;  We believe strongly thatworkflow automation will be a driving force in how we all work within thenext five years.andM;* End-user programming.andP;  The ultimate in customization is the ability for theend user to program his or her own applications.andP;  And the tools are beingdeveloped to allow this.andP;  Today, we have systems such as Metaphor DIS orDigital's Blueprint facility, both of which allow &quot;programming by example.&quot;andO;The user actually works through a business scenario, and the system keepstrack of the steps taken, outlining the process as it happens.andP;  The outlinecan be edited, as can the underlying script.andP;  Agents can be included.andO;Logical conditions can be added.andM;The next step in end-user programming will be &quot;visual programming,&quot; where theuser uses a graphical front end to draw the outline or flow chart of anapplication, tying objects together from an object library.andM;Vendor-Provided Customization.andP;  Lately, a new word keeps cropping up in ourreading and in speeches.andP;  The word is narrowcast, a variation on broadcast.andO;Whereas broadcast sends out a single message to a large number of recipients,narrowcast sends out a customized message to a single or a small group ofrecipients.andP;  Examples of narrowcast are seen in computer conferences.andP;  Whenyou sign up for one of these online conferences, you specify which tracks youwant to follow, and pay accordingly.andM;In the '90s, the scope of narrowcasting will expand.andP;  Newspapers will offercustomized versions, as will magazines.andP;  You will indicate which areas are ofinterest, and a personal version of your newspaper will arrive on yourdoorstep (or desktop) containing only stories that relate to those topics.andM;Customization Downside.andP;  The major downside to filter and narrowcast types ofcustomization is the danger of missing vital information.andP;  Most users areeager to screen the information they receive, but they also want someone (anagent?) to electronically tap them on the shoulder and point out asignificant development in an unrelated area that might be of interest.andM;This is going to be tough.andP;  AI technology will improve over the next fewyears and become more mainstream, but the mind is still the best computer,and it may take real intelligence to anticipate what you might need to knowor to recognize obscure relationships between topics.andM;MULTIMEDIA WINDOW INTO INFORMATION.andP;  So we have all this data that we accessthrough communications networks, filtering out the unneeded and massaging thesalient.andP;  But now we have to put this information into context.andP;  We have topresent it in a form that we can understand, both individually and as groups.andO;We call this the multimedia window into information.andP;  And, today, this windowis the compound document.andM;A compound document combines objects, such as text, graphics, images, anddata from a variety of sources into a single view.andP;  Other objects, such asvoice and video, are being added to the compound document architectures.andO;Theoretically, any object can be added eventually.andP;  Compound documents arecurrently limited to two dimensions, but, conceivably, once holography issufficiently advanced, a document could include a three-dimensional holograminstead of a flat image.andM;Like office, the word document is probably no longer appropriate.andP;  Documentimplies static printed material.andP;  Compound documents are living entities thatchange continually as the information that they contain changes.andM;Appropriate Windows.andP;  Before you all throw up your hands in surrender at thethought of buying all employees multimedia workstations, relax.andP;  The key tothe window on information is appropriateness to the application.andP;  As mostapplications (we mean customized business application, not word processor,spreadsheet, etc.) are enhanced, they will include graphics, voice, etc.andO;But, for now, many still need only text.andP;  For example, in our automatedclaims procedure, the initial clerk may well be working on a text terminal.andO;But the form that he or she is working on is tied into several databases,and, when the form is completed, the exit command can automatically send theform to the next person in line, who may be working with images, and, thus,needs an appropriate window.andM;Current RealityandM;The new model for office systems is very exciting, but are users ready tofollow it?andP;  Some definitely are.andP;  Early adopters of the new paradigm arefinancial institutions, which, by definition, recognize the value of data asa commodity.andP;  At a leading mutual funds trading firm in New England, salesrepresentatives sit at workstations that display several windows.andP;  Eachwindow is linked to a different service or application, some remote, somewithin the company.andP;  For example, one window runs the ticker tape from theAmerican and New York Stock Exchanges, while another accesses the in-houseapplication that automatically takes information from the ticker tapes andprovides up-to-the-minute evaluations of each stock in a fund.andP;  A thirdwindow is opened into the database of customer portfolios, a fourth shows agraphic indicating performance of any specified mutual fund, and a fifthwindow contains an entry form for taking new orders, which, incidentally,reads prices off the stock exchange ticker and locks in the sales price atthe time of request.andP;  The data sources are remote; connections are madethrough communications networks.andP;  The display of these windows is customized,and the windows themselves are multimedia (graphics, text).andP;  You can easilysee how, once voice objects come into common use, voice input from thecustomer could be added as confirmation of an order, for example.andM;Other users are less likely to jump on the bandwagon.andP;  A systems manager at agovernment installation worries about whether his employees will be able toassimilate this new world.andP;  He feels that the new model requires a change inthe way business is handled as well as significant training in the newtechnologies.andP;  &quot;Do I want to give my people that much power at the desktop?&quot;andO;he ponders.andP;  The head of office systems at another, nonprofit organizationdisagrees.andP;  &quot;Empower the people.andP;  How else can they grow?&quot;andP;  However, shepoints out that she hasn't discussed this with her superiors in MIS.andP;  &quot;I justgive my people the tools and let MIS notice the increase in productivity.&quot;andM;But both point out that we have to clean up a lot of problems before most oftoday's organizations are ready for the new world.andP;  And the major problem isinteroperability.andP;  &quot;It's our biggest problem,&quot; admits the forward-thinkinghead of office systems.andP;  &quot;It is the scandal of our technology,&quot; states ourgovernment source.andP;  &quot;Interoperability simply isn't here.andP;  And I blame it ongreed.andP;  The vendors have made a smoke screen of standards.andP;  Standards, albeitboring, could solve the problem.andP;  But each vendor claims to adhere tostandards, and then modifies the standard slightly--'adds value,'&quot; hesarcastically remark.andP;  And thus, systems can't interoperate.andP;  &quot;Capitalismsays, 'Add value to make money.'andP;  Vendors have to realize that value-addedshould not be modifications of standards but differentiators within theapplications that run under these standards.&quot;andP;  We tend to think (hope?) thatvendors aren't as venal as this.andP;  The fact is that standards are writtenbroadly in some areas.andP;  And there are legitimate &quot;standards-based&quot; productsthat interpret the documents differently.andP;  The resulting lack ofinteroperability highlights the absolute need for some form ofconformance-testing.andM;Another reason cited for a slow move to the new paradigm is the continuingbattle between MIS and the desktop.andP;  Although this eight-year-old war isreally over and a winner has been declared (the desktop obviously), MIS won'tlie down and die.andP;  And, in an era of shrinking budgets, MIS seems to begaining new strength, demanding the lion's share of what money is availableto maintain the mainframe databases.andM;&quot;The problem is, who owns the data,&quot; says our public servant.andP;  &quot;MIS peopledon't realize that their job is just maintenance.andP;  They can't admit that,like the laser printer, the mainframe is a peripheral.andP;  It is a sharednetwork resource.andP;  MIS hasn't been included in the future.andP;  The only way thatcorporate America can move to the new paradigm is by dealing in MIS.andP;  Showmanagers how they fit in.&quot;andM;And there is a place for MIS in this new model.andP;  MIS still has itsmaintenance functions.andP;  In addition, MIS's job is to ensure data integrityand security.andP;  MIS is probably also responsible for the acquisition ofoutside data feeds and for maintaining the electronic links with customersand suppliers.andP;  The real creative work, though, is in customization.andP;  Whilebusiness end users will be able to do rapid prototyping of customizedprocedures, the back-end linkages will require programming know-how and anintimate relationship with the data in the glass house--especially once thatdata becomes for sale.andM;The Common DenominatorandM;As Allan King stated in his tirade against &quot;office&quot; (see box, page 5),business is transacted on a national and global scale.andP;  People are no longerrestricted by location.andP;  And, with distributed computing environments,neither is data.andP;  In this new decade--a decade of distributed resources, bothhuman and electronic--the focus will be on the transparent access to datathat is used to solve specific business problems in customized businessapplications--applications such as monitoring the health of your business andwhere it stands vis a vis the competition.andP;  This is the real strategicadvantage of global information.andM;Office In PerspectiveandM;YESTERDAY'S OFFICE: CLERICAL.andP;  In the late 1970s and very early 1980s, officemeant word processing and mail merge (list processing).andP;  Office automationwas a clerical technology meant to improve productivity of typists.andP;  Wordprocessors counted keystrokes, kept track of time, measured the individualproductivity of operators for the expressed purpose of identifying the &quot;best&quot;operators.andP;  The goal was to eliminate personnel by giving tools that madetypists type faster and more accurately.andM;Soon, these standalone word processing systems were combined with basicelectronic mail and some rudimentary decision support on minicomputers.andP;  Butthese systems were still secretarial tools.andP;  E-mail connected secretary tosecretary.andM;With the introduction of the PC in 1982, and its popularization starting in'83, the spreadsheet became a vital part of office automation, though itwasn't recognized as such until several years later.andP;  The popularization ofspreadsheets was the first step in expanding office functionality beyondclerical functions.andP;  A different breed of users needed spreadsheets, peoplewho made decisions based on computational data.andM;Around this time, personal calendaring systems were being put in officesystems so that the secretary could maintain his or her boss's schedule.andO;This was the first step in automating management.andM;So, basically, yesterday's office looked like this:andM;TODAY'S OFFICE: TRANSPARENT SHARED DATA.andP;  Starting in the late 1980s, webegan tying things together, recognizing that, though the PC and wordprocessors improved individual productivity, islands of automation weren'tsufficient to handle the distribution of information within a company.andP;  Withdistributed network computing and friendly front ends to SQL databases, usershave easy access to online databases throughout the organization.andO;Information can be shared.andP;  And these corporate databases become the backboneof office systems, the foundation upon which office applications relied fordata.andP;  Enterprise-wide electronic mail has become the central nervous system,spreading this data throughout the organization.andP;  Individual calendars havestarted talking to each other via scheduling packages.andP;  Word processing isturning into document processing with the advances in publishing capabilitiesand integration of graphics and external data (usually spreadsheets, which,though more functional, remain pretty much the same individual tools) withintext files.andP;  List processing grew up and became personal databases (thoughmail merge is less and less of a word processing feature and more of adatabase function).andM;The problems with the office of today is lack of connectivity among in-housesystems.andP;  A Digital VAX doesn't speak the same language as an IBM 9370.andO;WordPerfect doesn't understand Final Word.andP;  The temporary solution has beeninterpreters, translators, and gateways--the Soft Switches and Keywords ofthe industry.andP;  But interpreters and translators merely convert one fileformat to another, and gateways send mail between two disparate electronicmail systems.andP;  Although, with a lot of work on the part of the providers orthe MIS department, these intermediary steps can be relatively transparent,they are all merely bridges into totally separate worlds.andP;  There is no senseof a single, cohesive system.andP;  The proclaimed solution to this problem isstandards.andM;The Present Is Confused.andP;  The office of today is still elusive.andP;  Until clearstandards for interoperability within an organization are set and written to,the transparency and access to corporate data will not be as easy as it needsto be just to meet today's idea of what an office is.andM;Enabling TechnologiesandM;In many ways, the new office model will come into effect &quot;because it can.&quot;andO;Technology has finally reached a point where, conceivably, a global virtualcomputer network can be established and be somewhat affordable.andM;Certain technologies have paved the way for this new era in office computing.andO;And the success of the model is dependent upon continued growth in thesedirections.andM;DISTRIBUTED COMPUTING ENVIRONMENTS.andP;  A Distributed Computing Environment(DCE) provides transparent access to data, resources, and services across aheterogeneous virtual network.andP;  The immediate goal for DCE is to create anenvironment that allows for interoperability and transparency of data betweendifferent environments.andP;  Okay, what does this really mean?andP;  Simply that,eventually, applications, processes, software, and operating systems canreside in the most optimal place within an environment (see Illustration 2).andO;The software itself can be dissected and distributed to run on differentplatforms.andP;  DCE treats the component hardware and software as though theywere all part of one logical computer system.andM;The key word is logical.andP;  Computer systems no longer need to be tied to asingle location.andP;  Geography is no longer a factor.andP;  Thus, users cantransparently access applications and data that may well reside halfwayaround the world.andM;The technology to do these heterogeneous connections and to distributesoftware is here today.andP;  The biggest barriers are cost of entry and the lackof standards.andP;  Within the next two years, office systems should betransparently heterogeneous and location independent.andP;  Just like officeworkers are.andM;STANDARDS PROMISE INTEROPERABILITY.andP;  The new office model requiredtransparent interoperability.andP;  The promise of standards is interoperabilityamong disparate hardware platforms and software applications.andP;  But this isstill only a promise.andP;  A lot of valuable time is being spent on fighting overwhat the standards are to be--Unix V versus OSF/1, Motif versus Open Look,MicroChannel versus EISA, ODA versus CDA versus MO:DCA.andM;The truth is, users don't care!andP;  Or they shouldn't.andP;  The technologies offeredup as standards are similar in capability.andP;  While one choice might bemarginally superior, the time wasted fighting over it results in seriousdelays where it counts, in writing robust applications that adhere to thestandards and, thus, can interoperate.andM;We're getting to the point, in some areas, where standards could be selectedby the market rather than simply by committee or by IBM.andP;  For example, in thecompound document arena, ODA is the declared ISO standard.andP;  But Digital ishoping that it can deliver so much more functionality via its CDA, that itsarchitecture will become the de facto standard.andM;OBJECT ORIENTATION.andP;  A major enabler of our new office paradigm is objectorientation, a programming concept that is more than 20 years old.andO;Object-oriented programming raises system development to a high level ofabstraction.andP;  The programmer's basic building block is the object, broadlydefined as data that knows about itself.andP;  An object knows what it cando--print, copy, calculate a sum, and so on--and it interacts with otherobjects by sending them messages.andP;  Many vendors and users believe theobject-oriented programming model is the best way to deal with the growingcomplexity of information systems and networks.andM;Object orientation adds a degree of flexibility, function, and reusability tosoftware that is not possible with conventional procedural methods.andP;  Businessapplications are getting harder to create, given the increasing amounts ofdata, number of information sources, and visual presentations of results theyrequire.andP;  There's a real need for object orientation, where hundreds of linesof code can be contained in a single object, stored in a library ordirectory, and shipped around the (global) network to be used and reused byany number of people.andM;Object orientation has gained a large following today because the conditionsare right for it.andP;  Today's desktop computers, with large memory and fastprocessors, are better equipped to handle the overhead of object systems thanwere earlier generations.andP;  And technology supporting the concept has maturedconsiderably.andP;  Although there are still many questions about how best toapply object-oriented programming techniques, vendors are applying theconcepts of object-oriented programming that are well understood.andP;  Forexample, Hewlett-Packard's NewWave environment is an innovative yet practicalsolution that uses the object paradigm to simplify user interaction with aset of resources.andP;  Eventually, HP will need an object-oriented databasebehind NewWave, but that technology is just reaching maturity today.andP;  HP islikely to add an &quot;objectbase&quot; to NewWave later.andM;By the middle of the decade, object orientation will be so pervasivethroughout computing environments that we won't have to think about it atall.andM;VOICE/DATA INTEGRATION.andP;  The integration of voice and data in applications ishappening now.andP;  Users in different locations are beginning to be able tocarry on a telephone conversation while simultaneously viewing the sameinformation onscreen.andP;  Computer-assisted dialing and automated attendantapplications are also coming into wide use.andM;Related technology is video conferencing.andP;  People can talk face-to-face eventhough they are thousands of miles apart.andP;  In a few years, voice/dataintegration and video conferencing will be combined.andP;  A window on yourdesktop could show a live video image of someone (or multiple other people)while, in another window, the real-time transmitted data could be displayed.andM;Other applications that combine voice and data are starting to show up.andO;Collection agencies, for example, will respond to an &quot;I never spoke to youragency before&quot; claim by replaying a digitized recording of the last phoneconversation.andM;Integrated voice and data also allows computer-assisted dialing, coordinatedvoice call and data transfer, voice annotation of files, text-to-voiceconversion, and voice recognition.andP;  In general, integrating the spoken wordwith the electronic brings a new degree of ease-of-use for most of us.andP;  Mostpeople are more comfortable talking than typing.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
