The committee voted 11-5 for the bill, sponsored by Sens.Howard Metzenbaum (D., Ohio) and James Jeffords (R., Vt.).All the Democratic committee members and two Republicans --Mr. Jeffords and Sen. David Durenberger of Minnesota -- votedfor the measure.</LP><TEXT>   Separately, Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole is expectedtoday to urge that the maximum civil penalty for a violationof provisions of child-labor law be boosted to $10,000 from$1,000. In testimony prepared for delivery to the House LaborStandards subcommittee, Mrs. Dole will note that thedepartment's Employment Standards Administration already hasboosted penalties as much as fourfold by consideringdifferent violations involving one child separately, ratherthan as a single violation.   Two recent sweeps by the agency uncovered more than 2,800child-labor violations, and more than $6 million in penaltyassessments are expected, according to her testimony.   Under the bill approved by the Senate panel, employerviolations of the occupational safety and health law thatresult in worker deaths would become felonies, rather thanmisdemeanors. The legislation also would boost the maximumjail sentence to 10 years from six months and the maximumfine for such criminal violations under the worker safety andhealth law to $250,000 from $10,000 for each violation. TheJustice Department says maximum fines of $250,000 a violationfor individuals and $500,000 for companies already can beimposed under general criminal code.   Under the Senate bill, willful violations that result inserious bodily injury would become a criminal offense subjectto a jail sentence of as much as five years. And any federalpreemption of often-tougher state prosecutions of suchviolations on murder or other charges wouldn't be allowed.   The Bush administration supports the increasing criminalpenalties for employer violations that result in death andthe bar on federal pre-emption. But it opposes makingresponsibility for serious bodily injury a criminal offense;the Labor Department has said it is impossible to define withany clarity what constitutes such an injury.</TEXT></DOC>
