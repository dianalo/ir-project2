Forty-seven electoral votes,'' he saidon arrival Friday night at the Burbank airport.   ``We win this one, we win it all,'' he said.   Bentsen claimed the latest polls showed the Republican leadcollapsing and insisted the Democrats still had time to catch themby election day. Bentsen planned to attend a get-out-the-vote rallythis morning in East Los Angeles.   ``The Republicans are dropping like a rock in those polls,'' hetold the cheering crowd of several hundred at the airport rally.   Bentsen was in Texas and New Mexico earlier in the day. InHouston, Bentsen worked to highlight the Democratic ticket'scommitment to the space program, which has a major presence in Texasindustry and with the Johnson Space Center in Houston.   The Texas senator toured the Challenger Center at the HoustonMuseum of Natural Science. The center was founded as part of aneffort, in the wake of the 1986 Challenger space shuttle tragedy, toboost interest in science and technology among the young.   Bentsen looked at a mock space station to watch fourth gradersoperate various devices, and he took an electronic stress test. Agirl held wires to Bentsen's finger and measured only 1.6 on a scalein which 5 is considered normal.   ``That means I'm cool,'' the senator quipped.   Bentsen also met with a student audience in the museumauditorium, and made an unusual miscue.   The man Michael Dukakis has said would head up his cabinetcouncil on space asserted that the next space shuttle launched, theAtlantis, would be unmanned. In fact, the ship will have a crew offive for its secret military mission later this month.   Aides attributed the mistake to an incorrect briefing paper.   On his way to California, Bentsen stopped in Las Cruces, N.M.,for a rally at that airport with about 500 supporters, hosted bySen. Jeff Bingaman, D-N.M.   Bentsen said he wanted to ``set 'em straight'' on issues theRepublicans have distorted, such as gun control and defense. The LasCruces area is near the White Sands testing area, and governmentresearch dollars are important to the area economy.   Bentsen told the crowd a Democratic administration would spend $1billion a year on research on Star Wars. The Democrats currentlyoppose deployment of a space-based missile defense system.</TEXT></DOC>
