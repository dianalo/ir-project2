 The firststep in turning a 'flood' of data into powerful, usefulinformation is to define whether an information 'universe'consists primarily of external or internal information.andP;  Winnowingexternal news is relatively simple;

 Increasingly, we all face thequestion: How can I cope with this flood of information?andM;One solution is to close your door and unhook your PC.andP;  Take it off thenetwork.andP;  Close your mailbox (electronic or physical) and get a secretary todiscard everything for you.andP;  If that seems too drastic (there might besomething in that electronic flow that you want to know about), here are somemore moderate approaches.andP;  A lot of tools out there can turn this tide intohydropower.andM;First, you must define your information universe.andP;  Does it consist of outsidenews sources or internal information?andP;  If it's internal, is it a host ofword-processing documents or lots of 1-2-3 spreadsheets?andP;  E-mail messages ora corporate database you can't fool around with?andP;  Is it shared or is it allyours?andP;  Political, social, and organizational factors also come intoplay--subjects that could fill several columns.andM;If you interact with external news, winnowing information is relativelysimple.andP;  A remarkable amount of it exists in electronic form.andP;  Simply byshifting from paper to PC perusal of public information, you can let yourcomputer do the walking for you.andP;  Subscribe to something like ComputerLibrary on CD-ROM or a dial-up news-archive service such as Nexis or DowJones.andP;  Set tight search criteria for these services so that they can gleanwhat you need.andP;  Third-party redistributors of news such as Desktop Data andIndividual, Inc., also supply prefiltered news electronically (Individualalso supplies daily fax transmissions).andM;But if internal information defines your world, you're going to have to worryabout networking, incompatible data formats, and so forth.andM;The simplest tool (aside from knowing the names of the files you want) isplain old text retrieval--the ability to search with keywords.andP;  Your choicesrange from straightforward products such as Lotus Magellan and OnTechnology's On Location to industrial-strength ones such as Zylab's ZyIndexand Battelle's Basis.andP;  Some index your entire hard disk (or your wholeserver, as you direct); others search for words in any file you specify,without indexing in advance.andP;  (Indexing takes more time up front, but thesearches go more quickly.andP;  You have to determine what trade-off isappropriate.)andM;All of these filters can help you find information.andP;  But what about automatedways of handling information?andP;  The most exciting is smart e-mail.andP;  (Thisgenerally requires your correspondents to have smart e-mail, too--and Ibelieve most people will in the next few years.)andM;Consider the mail you get.andP;  Most messages use a lot of words: &quot;Please call meto set up a meeting about the budget plans for your department sometime nextweek.andP;  Thursday afternoon would be best for me.andP;  And please check to see ifJuan and Alice can make it too.andP;  Thanks!andP;  Gwen.&quot;andM;The guts of the message are simple: &quot;Meeting about budget plans.andP;  Thursdayafternoon.andP;  You.andP;  Juan.andP;  Alice.&quot;andP;  Gwen could type them into a meeting form inten seconds.andP;  And smart e-mail could look at your calendar and give Gwen aquick yes or an alternative time.andP;  Instead of expanding a memo into politeEnglish, it's simpler to put it into a form that can be handled by a computerprogram at the other end.andM;There's more to this.andP;  You can classify incoming mail, collect news articles,decide what to read on the corporate bulletin board, and program your systemto keep and classify what you want and discard the rest.andP;  You canautomatically send memos and reminders to other people--for example, you canaccompany sales reports with letters in an appropriate tone, as determined bycomparing results with quotas.andM;With the proper systems in place for &quot;mail-enabled applications,&quot; you caneven send &quot;memos&quot; to other applications telling them what to do, leaving youmore time to handle the nonroutine, interesting business.andP;  After all, thesteps that expand simple information into English at one end and thencondense it back into computer data at the other are really just a waste oftime.andP;  This is time that could be better spent turning more complicatedthoughts--about company goals, marketing strategies, and other ideas thatcan't be reduced to a simple calendar entry or sales report--into meaningfulprose.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
