They were spoken by RichardNixon 21 years ago this month. Since then, Mr. Nixon's wordshave become an eerie echo, bouncing unabated from onepresidential administration to another. And the problem hassimply grown worse.   Now, it is President Bush's turn to try to tame the healthcare monster. Yesterday, before an audience of Clevelandcivic leaders, he formally released the details of his $100billion health plan. In doing so, he repeated many of thesame themes articulated by Mr. Nixon -- the need to broadenaccess to medical care, to make its delivery more efficient,and to build upon the current system, rather than replace itwholesale. Mr. Bush even embraced what was under Mr. Nixon anovel approach to controlling health care costs: prepaidmedical plans such as health maintenance organizations, orHMOs.   In addition, the president put his own new spin on healthcare reform. Borrowing from the free-market plans ofconservative academics, his proposal includes tax vouchersand deductions to help millions of uninsured or underinsuredAmericans buy private medical coverage.   The early reaction among many Bush foes and alliessuggests the president's plan stopped short of the radicalreform necessary to make the nation's ailing health caresystem work. And as a result, it may stymie comprehensivehealth care legislation rather than advance it.   &quot;We finally have the political capital building to reformthe system,&quot; says Robert Laszewski, executive vice presidentof Liberty Mutual Insurance Group. But by taking a piecemealapproach, the administration risks &quot;expending the politicalcapital for change&quot; and still leaving &quot;a system that is outof control.&quot;   Mr. Bush's plan largely sidestepped two critical issues.First, how to fund the expensive tax breaks. Mr. Bush dumpedthe biggest part of that job in the lap of Congress. Andsecond, how to control health care costs, which pose asignificant financial burden for U.S. corporations and is theroot cause why so many Americans end up without insurance.   By giving millions of Americans the means to buy moremedical care -- without a comprehensive cost-containmentstrategy -- health policy experts say Mr. Bush's planthreatens to make health care costs climb even faster. Healthcare costs are expected this year to consume 14% of thenation's output, exactly double what it was under PresidentNixon two decades ago.   The Bush plan &quot;is the most inflationary suggestion I haveheard in memory,&quot; said Bruce C. Vladeck, president of theUnited Hospital Fund, a philanthropic group that supports NewYork hospitals. &quot;And what do you get for it? An enormousincrease in public expenditures and all you really do isenrich the insurance companies.&quot;   Not even all the insurers are pleased. &quot;Each of the pointsthe president has suggested are good ones, and they are goingto work,&quot; says Mr. Laszewski of Liberty Mutual. But &quot;we haveto recognize that cost is the issue, and from what I've seenfrom the president's list so far, I'd give him anincomplete.&quot;   A big part of Mr. Bush's problem, according to many of hisown supporters, is that when his big moment finally arrived,the president couldn't pull the trigger. The finalpreparations of his health plan were marked by politicalmissteps, alienating key congressional supporters. Suddenly,with his election-year plan in danger of sinking, Bush aidesfrantically began throwing key proposals overboard.   Angry over being excluded from the decision-makingprocess, Rep. Willis Gradison, the ranking Republican on akey House health subcommittee, confronted Bush aides in astormy, closed-door meeting. The White House responded bydropping a measure that would have taxed employer-paid healthbenefits of wealthier workers -- a provision intended tobring price-sensitivity and competition to the health caremarket. Bush aides also jettisoned a proposal to cut morethan $40 billion in future growth from the Medicare program,replacing it with a 38-page suggestion box of where Congressmight find money to pay for the new tax breaks.   The resulting Bush plan lacks the imagination of theinnovative market reforms like those proposed by the HeritageFoundation, and also ignores the down-to-earth governmentbudget controls proposed by Democrats.   &quot;I liken it to a train that was supposed to go down onetrack, and somebody pulled a switch, and now its going downanother, where no one knows what awaits it,&quot; says Uwe E.Reinhardt, a Princeton professor of health economics.   Robert Helms, director of health policy studies at theAmerican Enterprise Institute, notes that the cost controlsin the plan are almost entirely directed at public programsproviding health insurance to the poor. &quot;You have to givepeople an incentive to produce private cost containment inaddition to public cost containment,&quot; he says. Removing thetax deductibility of health care coverage would have donethat, Mr. Helms says.   White House Budget Director Richard Darman argues that Mr.Bush's health plan, even in its current form, &quot;is still moredetailed than 29 of the 31 plans that are out there.&quot; Iffully adopted, Mr. Darman says, &quot;every poor person inAmerica&quot; will be able to get some health insurance coverage.He called the tax-credit provision &quot;a fairly radical pro-poorreform.&quot;   Moreover, administration officials privately suggest thatyesterday's proposal may only be the first step. The WhiteHouse will be willing to offer more comprehensive proposalsafter the election.   But many health experts are still unimpressed. Theydispute Mr. Darman's claim, for instance, that every poorperson in America would be covered by this plan. And it won't&quot;really solve the problem of the uninsured non-poor,&quot; saysMark Pauly, executive director of the Leonard Davis Instituteof Health Economics at the University of Pennsylvania.   State officials are particularly angry at the president'ssuggestion that the tax credits could be funded in part bycapping federal Medicaid payments. &quot;In a state like Vermont,we will simply be able to cover less people,&quot; says Gov.Howard Dean, a Democrat and a physician. Medicaid funds forlong-term care, in particular, may be cut back, experts fear.The White House counters that low-income people will now beable to buy private health insurance so the caps won'tmatter.   The plan also contains incentives to promote the use ofHMOs and other fixed-price health plans, where patients aredirected to pre-selected health care providers. While someHMOs have been successful at providing quality care at lowercosts, government investigators have repeatedly found thatpoor and elderly people have suffered at the hands ofunscrupulous HMO providers. &quot;HMO oversight has been abysmal,&quot;says Dennis O'Leary, a physician who heads the JointCommission for Accreditation of Health Care Organizations.His group doesn't accredit HMOs.   Mr. Bush's 24-minute speech, to the Greater ClevelandGrowth Association, drew tepid and sporadic applause from hisbusiness audience. He sought to walk a delicate line betweenadvocates of reform and the status quo, describing the U.S.health care system both as in &quot;crisis&quot; and &quot;the best in theworld.&quot; Plainly on the political defensive after delayinghealth reforms until the fourth year of his term, he spent asmuch time criticizing rival Democratic proposals as outlininghis own.   Under Mr. Bush's plan, certain poor Americans would beentitled to a tax credit or deduction of as much as $1,250for individuals, $2,500 for married couples and $3,750 forfamilies of three or more, to be used for purchasing healthcoverage. When fully implemented in the next five years, thecredits would be available to Americans with incomes belowthe threshold for filing income taxes, which is now just over$15,000 for a family of four. Lesser credits would beavailable to those with incomes below 150% of the filingthreshold. The credits would be indexed for inflation.   States would be required to develop a benefit packageequal to the value of the credits.   Middle-income Americans -- earning up to $50,000 forindividuals, $65,000 for married couples and $80,000 forfamilies -- could receive either a pared-down tax credit or atax deduction. But the deduction would be reduced by thevalue of any health benefits already provided by theemployers.   The proposed plan is estimated to cost $100 billion over afive-year phase-in period and $35 billion a year thereafter.   President Bush's plan also contains the followingelements:   -- It would require health insurance companies to provideguaranteed renewable coverage to all employers requesting it,even if their employees have expensive medical conditions.   -- It would allow small businesses to pool together, evenacross state lines, to buy health insurance at lower prices.These &quot;health insurance networks&quot; would be exempt from stateinsurance mandates.   -- It would reform malpractice laws to cap the amount ofdamages plaintiffs could receive.   Even before the president delivered his noon speechannouncing the plan, the House Select Committee on Aging helda hearing to attack it. Among the witnesses were HouseMajority Leader Richard Gephardt (D., Mo.) and Sen. HarrisWofford (D., Pa.).   Some Democrats, however, welcomed the proposals,regardless of their content. &quot;When the president is out ofthe debate, it's hard to carry on a debate,&quot; said Rep. SanderLevin (D., Mich.), a member of a House health subcommittee.&quot;At least, he's now in the arena of debate.&quot;   ---   John Harwood contributed to this article.</TEXT></DOC>
