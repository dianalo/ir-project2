This trend does not only exist in the manufacturing of carbody and equipment parts but also of parts of the running gear, steeringand drive systems. In the choice of alternative materials it must beconsidered that economic efficiency plays an important role in additionto the often diverse requirementss of function and reliability. In thiscontribution the dynamic and static test bench results obtained withcomponents of different materials are shown and compared.</TEXT></DOC>
