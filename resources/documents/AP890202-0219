Redman said.   Asked about a CBS News report implicating Syria and Libya, Redmansaid ``the investigators have not yet reached any conclusion aboutwho is responsible.''   A total of 270 people perished in the Dec. 21 crash, including259 persons on the 747 jet and 11 persons in the Scottish village ofLockerbie, where the plane hit. The flight originated in Frankfurt,West Germany, and then went to London before taking off for New York.   Secretary of State James A. Baker III said Wednesday night hecould not confirm the CBS report. ``I don't know that anyresponsibility has been determined,'' Baker said at a White Housereception.   According to CBS, the attack on Flight 103 was in retaliation forthe U.S. bombing of Libya in 1986 and was also spurred by the U.S.decision in December to talk with the Palestine LiberationOrganization. The network quoted sources ``deep within the terroristmovement.''   The principal architect of the bombing was Ahmed Jibril, head ofthe extreme Palestinian group, the Popular Front for the Liberationof Palestine-General Command, CBS said.   Jibril, based in Syria, was working for Libyan leader MoammarGadhafi, although he was also required to clear the operation withSyrian intelligence officials, the network reported.   Gadhafi sent a distant cousin, Sayed Gaddafidam, to Jibril, whois known to hate the United States, CBS said. Three years ago,Jibril told a news conference in Libya: ``There will be no safetyfor any traveler on an Israeli or U.S. airliner.''   Jibril, a former officer in Syrian military intelligence, clearedthe operation for an American target with Syrian intelligence and,with full backing of the Libyan secret service, moved to Frankfurt,West Germany, and made the Pan Am plane his target, CBS said.   The network quoted Omar Shehabi, a Jabril spokesman, as sayingthrough an interpreter, ``I tell you that we didn't do it and we arenot involved. We don't practice terrorism and we condemn suchactions.''   Investigators ``are close'' to accepting that chain of events asthe official version, CBS said.   Investigators believe that the bomb that destroyed Flight 103 wasput aboard in Frankfurt.   In Edinburgh, Scotland, Radio Forth reported the bomb was plantedby Palestinian terrorists in the luggage of a CIA agent.   The radio report, citing information from unidentified Scottishpolice sources, said the CIA officer was returning from Beirut withfive colleagues after a mission to negotiate release of the nineAmerican hostages in Lebanon.   Scottish investigators refused comment on the Radio Forth report.   In December, U.S. officials in Washington, speaking on conditionof anonymity, told The Associated Press the CIA's chief in Beirutwas among the jet's passengers. They did not give the agent's name.   Radio Forth did not name the agent it said was on the jet. Itsaid investigators believe a three-pound charge of Semtex explosiveand a timing device were slipped into the agent's luggage byPalestinian terrorists who infiltrated the secret Beirut mission.   The radio report said the baggage was shipped from Beirut viaHelsinki to Frankfurt, where the agents caught the flight for NewYork. The timer was believed to have been activated during the stopin Helsinki, the report said.</TEXT></DOC>
