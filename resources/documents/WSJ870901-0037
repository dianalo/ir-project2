On that day, at 2 a.m., Senate Republicans narrowly passed a sweeping deficit-reduction package, including cuts in Social Security cost-of-living adjustments.    It was &quot;the most exciting vote I've ever cast in the 26 years I've been around this place,&quot; Sen. Dole contends.    The excitement didn't last long. Under pressure from Rep. Jack Kemp and other House Republicans, President Reagan later withdrew his support from the package and killed what Carol Cox, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, calls &quot;the last best chance we had of a balanced budget in the foreseeable future.&quot;    Instead, the president will leave behind him the largest peacetime deficits in the nation's history, an uncomfortable legacy for the GOP, which for more than a century has wrapped itself in balanced-budget rhetoric. Republican presidential contenders are now struggling with that troublesome legacy, and their positions reflect deep ambivalence.    Aside from Rep. Kemp, most of them agree the deficit is cause for very serious concern. Vice President George Bush calls it a &quot;megaproblem&quot;; Sen. Dole says it is the &quot;biggest single problem in America&quot;; Pat Robertson insists deficits are &quot;fiscally and morally wrong&quot;; and Alexander Haig says reducing the deficit is the &quot;first step toward greater prosperity.&quot;    But for the most part, they are loath to endorse the politically painful measures that experts say are needed to close the budget gap. Moreover, their political advisers tell them that voters don't care much about the problem anyway.    &quot;The deficit issue has never been articulated in a way that makes it have a meaningful influence on the life of the average voter,&quot; says Lance Tarrance, a pollster for Rep. Kemp. &quot;It just doesn't cut as a political issue.&quot;    &quot;It's hard for people to understand what the problem is when interest rates are down, unemployment is down, inflation is down and the stock market is up,&quot; agrees former Louisiana Republican Rep. Henson Moore, a board member of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.    The deficit is expected to drop sharply this year to about $157 billion from $221 billion last year, thanks primarily to cutbacks in defense spending, lower interest rates and an unexpected windfall from tax reform. But estimates by both the White House Office of Management and Budget and the Congressional Budget Office show the deficit rising over the next two years if no further cuts are made.    So far, Sen. Dole has stressed the deficit issue most among the GOP presidential hopefuls. His staff cites polls showing that people are indeed worried about the deficit. By touting that 1985 budget vote, he reminds voters of the key role he has played over the last six years in attempts to close the budget gap by raising taxes or cutting popular programs.    But even Sen. Dole won't go so far as to actually endorse new taxes or cuts in middle-class entitlement programs like Social Security. He says only that &quot;tax rates&quot; shouldn't be raised, and steers clear of other specifics.    At the other extreme, Rep. Kemp argues that economic growth will take care of much of the deficit problem. Without ever mentioning Sen. Dole by name, Mr. Kemp criticizes those in both parties who &quot;would meet the challenge of budget deficits by increasing taxes, cutting back on Social Security and weakening our national defense.&quot; He opposes any tax increase or change in Social Security and he supports more spending for the costly Star Wars defense program.    &quot;That's vintage Kemp,&quot; says former Rep. Moore. &quot;He's still on the Laffer curve.&quot; (The Laffer curve suggested tax cuts could pay for themselves by boosting economic growth.)    For Vice President Bush, the deficit problem is particularly sticky. Like Sen. Dole, he comes from a Republican tradition that believes deficits are a serious concern. And he is quick to acknowledge the problem.    But so far, Mr. Bush has done nothing to separate himself from the president's policies. Like Mr. Reagan, he supports the defense buildup, opposes changing Social Security, and believes that higher taxes &quot;are not the answer.&quot; That leaves only a third of the federal budget to bear the brunt of deficit reduction.    While Mr. Bush's deficit quandary may not matter much to some voters, it does cause concern among establishment Republicans, many of whom privately agree with former House GOP leader John Rhodes that &quot;the Reagan administration has really had its head in the sand as far as the deficit is concerned.&quot; Rep. Kemp's strategy is to ignore such conventional Republicans. But Mr. Bush will have to compete with Sen. Dole for their support in order to win the nomination.    Former Delaware Gov. Pierre S. du Pont IV has staked out a position closer to Rep. Kemp's. &quot;He's concerned about the deficit,&quot; says research aide Jeff Eisenach, &quot;but he doesn't place it at the top of the list of large problems.&quot;    Mr. du Pont's deficit stance is further muddied by his proposal to overhaul the Social Security system, which would add tens of billions of dollars to the budget deficit in the near term. But Mr. Eisenach argues the plan would greatly improve the government's &quot;balance sheet,&quot; since it would replace large future liabilities of the Social Security system with private retirement plans.    Mr. Haig is closer to Sen. Dole's position. Mr. Haig believes that the president and Congress should &quot;strike a grand compromise&quot; on the deficit, an approach President Reagan has specifically rejected this year for fear it would lead to new taxes. The principal concern of the former secretary of state and NATO commander is that defense not be forced to &quot;bear the entire burden&quot; of deficit reduction. He says taxes should only be considered &quot;after all areas have been scrutinized.&quot;    Mr. Robertson supports the Gramm-Rudman law's approach to the budget, requiring across-the-board cuts if Congress fails to act. The television evangelist opposes new taxes &quot;of any kind,&quot; and even supports expanding the costly personal exemption given to taxpayers for their dependents. His preferred method of deficit reduction: turning government programs over to the private sector.    Whether the deficit issue will become a major issue among the GOP candidates remains to be seen. Mr. Tarrance believes it would take months of sharply rising interest rates &quot;to inflame the political debate over the budget.&quot; And political scientist James Savage at the University of California at Berkeley says there has never been an election &quot;that turned on the issue of the deficit.&quot;    Ms. Cox of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget says she'll be just as happy if deficits are kept out of the political campaigns. &quot;If they just don't go around promising not to raise taxes and promising not to cut Social Security,&quot; she says, &quot;then we will have won a major victory.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
