John J. Shields, president and chief executive officer,said in an interview that much of the staff reduction will beaccomplished by attrition. He noted that the revenue slowdownalso is affecting many of Prime's competitors, which alreadyhave reported lower earnings or losses for the first quarter.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Shields declined to disclose Prime's first-quarterresults, saying they will be reported tomorrow. However, hesaid, &quot;I don't see any problem with our ability to generatethe cash to meet our obligations,&quot; in terms of interestpayments.   Prime, Natick, Mass., is heavily indebted because of aleveraged buy-out by DR Holdings Inc. two years ago. Itdoesn't have any public stock outstanding, though some of itsdebt is publicly traded. DR Holdings is a unit of J.H.Whitney andamp; Co., a closely held venture capital and buy-outfirm based in New York. American Express Co.'s ShearsonLehman Brothers Inc. unit holds $500 million in DR Holdingsand Prime debt as a result of making a bridge loan for theacquisition that it wasn't able to refinance.   A spokesman for Shearson said, &quot;Prime is current with itspayments, and we're comfortable with the credit.&quot; ChrisMahoney, an analyst at Moody's Investors Service Inc. whocovers Shearson, said Prime's &quot;cash flows have exceededprojections. We're relatively comfortable with theperformance of the loan.&quot;   Prime makes midrange computers and computerized designsystems. Both parts of its business are facing technologicalrevolution, as well as problems induced by the recession.   Last year, aided by strong sales in Europe and a vigorouscost-cutting program that reduced the work force to 8,700people from 10,670 at the beginning of the year, Prime'srevenue grew 4.7% to $1.59 billion from $1.52 billion, and DRHoldings' net loss narrowed to $135 million from $277million. Despite the losses, Mr. Shields said there's amplecash flow to cover interest payments. Last year, Primereported operating profit of $82.2 million. Much of its lossreflects noncash charges for depreciation and amortization,totaling $276.5 million. In addition, of the $222.8 millioninterest expense last year, $42.4 million was payment inkind, with paper rather than cash interest payments.   &quot;They had a much better year last year than I expected,&quot;said Charles Foundyller, president of Daratech Inc., aCambridge, Mass., market research firm. &quot;They had acceptancelast year, and that doesn't just disappear in a quarter.&quot;   However, the past few months have been rough on Prime.Many computer makers have said that European business, whichhad been very strong for several years, has tailed off.Moreover, the rise in the dollar against major Europeancurrencies presumably hurt Prime's first-quarter results.Last year, Prime got 65% of its revenue from internationalmarkets, mostly in Europe.   In other bad news, Prime's Computervision division failedto win a piece of a big Navy contract that was awarded torival Intergraph Corp. last month. And Prime had to slash theprices of some of its major software packages by as much as50%.   Mr. Shields said Prime hadn't added workers inanticipation of winning the Navy contract, adding that itwould have produced only $35 million in revenue over fiveyears. He said the price cuts &quot;will open up more marketopportunities for us.&quot; He also confirmed that Prime plans tostart selling most of its computerized-design software aspackages separate from hardware systems and said Prime willtry to attract independent resellers for the first time.   But some industry watchers and competitors say that Primewill have an uphill struggle. &quot;This is a company in adownward spiral,&quot; said John Dunkle, an analyst with WorkgroupTechnologies Inc., Hampton, N.H. &quot;Their technologies arebeing eclipsed, and their customer base is migrating to otherproducts.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
