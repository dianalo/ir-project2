Take William Donoghue, a newsletter publisher and chairman of Donoghue Organization Inc., a Holliston, Mass., research concern. In a special report released last week, he told subscribers their &quot;risk of loss is too great to ignore.&quot; He added: &quot;Sell now and switch to a fund with little or no South African exposure.&quot;    The South African skittishness stems from a U.S. anti-apartheid bill that would make it illegal for U.S. citizens -- and mutual funds -- to hold South African securities. The bill has passed the House and a version now is before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee; a vote could come this autumn.    But some investors and fund managers plan to stick it out. They say, for one thing, that passage isn't a certainty, and they also believe President Reagan would veto such a bill.    &quot;It's our opinion at the moment that there will be no sanction legislation signed into law in '88,&quot; says J. David Edwards, portfolio manager for the $210 million United Services Gold Fund, which holds only South African shares and plans to continue to do so. The fund has been battered this year. Its value has plunged more than 38% through last Thursday, according to Lipper Analytical Services Inc.    Some investors also will hold on. Brian Gennity, a Houston lawyer and shareholder of ASA Ltd., says that although he opposes apartheid, he believes the U.S. bill is unconstitutional and won't be passed. What's more, he plans to keep his holdings &quot;on principle,&quot; although he concedes it's risky.    A recent Wharton Econometrics survey estimated that the market value of U.S. investors' holdings in South African gold companies could decline $1.2 billion if they were all forced to sell within a six-month period, the legislative time frame.    The study was sponsored by New York-based International Investors Inc., the nation's largest gold fund. It said U.S. investors held about 14% of all South African mining shares outstanding at year end. Those holdings had a total market value of more than $4.5 billion, of which more than $3.2 billion was in gold mining shares.    Though the study only covered the gold mining industry, it said U.S. investors could face other large losses in shares of platinum and diamond companies. Investors might also be hurt by exchange-rate changes triggered by sudden dumping of shares on the market, said Gerald Godshaw, who wrote the study.    Some managers who run gold funds aren't waiting to learn the sanctions bill's outcome. The $276 million Franklin Gold Fund, for instance, has gradually lowered its exposure in South African holdings this year to 25% -- the lowest it's ever been -- and plans to lighten up still more. In addition to the political concern, the fund has picked up better buys in Australian and North American mining issues, says Martin Wiskeman, fund manager.    So, too, has Caesar Bryan, who runs the $98 million Lexington Gold Fund. As a result, he's cut the fund's percentage of South African gold mining shares to 10% of the portfolio, and likely will pare it down to closer to 5%.    &quot;On a risk-reward basis, it just seemed sensible to reduce the holdings,&quot; Mr. Bryan said.    Even if the sanctions bill doesn't become law this year, he added, there could be selling pressure if Michael Dukakis is elected president. Mr. Dukakis favors stricter sanctions against South Africa than his opponent, Vice President Bush.    Some managers, meantime, suggest that the sanctions bill already has been factored into the depressed prices of South African mining shares. &quot;We think South African shares are about as beat as they can get,&quot; says Mr. Edwards of United Services Gold Fund. &quot;All those that have listened to {talk of getting out of the South African market} have acted on it,&quot; he added.    Thus, if a bill isn't passed, Mr. Edwards contends, &quot;The surprises on the upside could be pretty dramatic.&quot;    That doesn't sway Mr. Donoghue, the newsletter writer. He says that even if the market has discounted the sanctions pressure, &quot;Who knows how far this thing could go?&quot;    ---   THERE'S GOLD IN THAT THAR INDEX: Some gold funds don't invest at all in South Africa, of course. The newest: the Benham Gold Equities Index.    But it's what the Benham fund does invest in -- the shares of 30 major U.S. and Canadian gold-mining companies -- that makes it different. As such, it calls itself the first gold index fund, and Benham officials expect it to mirror the trends of the North American gold industry as a whole.    Tracking any gold market hasn't been very profitable this year, though. Gold funds have been by far the worst-performing mutual fund group through September, according to Lipper, skidding more than 13%. </TEXT></DOC>
