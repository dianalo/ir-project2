North took the stand shortly after George Bush was identified incourt as an intermediary in President Reagan's secret plan to aidthe Contras.   North, who faces a dozen charges in connection with his role inthe Iran-Contra affair, said, ``I was particularly admonished'' tokeep secret ``that another country was providing millions ofdollars to help the Contras.'' Saudi Arabia supplied some $32million in aid to the Contras, beginning in mid-1984.   Asked by defense lawyer Brendan Sullivan who told him he wasgoing to be running the operation, North identified then-nationalsecurity adviser Robert McFarlane, his deputy John Poindexter, andCIA Director William Casey.   Under questioning from his lawyer, the former White House aidedepicted himself as a Marine officer with plans to take command ofa battalion at Camp LeJeune when top officials in the Reaganadministration enlisted him to run the secret Contra operation in1984.   North testified in his own defense after his attorneys read intothe record a lengthy account of the Reagan administration's effortsto keep alive the Contra struggle against the leftist government ofNicaragua.   The account, a legal ``admission of fact'' read to the jury withthe agreement of the prosecution, said Bush personally told thepresident of Honduras in 1985 that extra aid was being funneled tohis country as payment for helping the Contras.   The account also said a representative of Panamanian militaryleader Manuel Noriega offered in a meeting with North toassassinate the Sandinista leadership in Nicaragua. North was saidto reply that the United States wanted no part of any such plans.   Deputy White House press secretary Stephen Hart said, ``I haveno comment'' on the developments, adding that ``this is part of anongoing trial.''   A short while after the ``admission of fact'' statement wasread, North was on the stand and fielding questions from his ownattorney.   ``Was there a time when you were stepping in'' to help theContras, asked North lawyer Brendan Sullivan.   ``I was not stepping in, I was brought in,'' responded North.   ``I was told not to tell anybody'' about his role in taking overfrom the CIA in overseeing the Contras' needs, North testified.   Prosecutor John Keker objected when Sullivan asked whether North``understood'' that President Reagan had designated him as theContras' new provider. U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesellsustained the objection and North didn't answer.   North said he ended up handling ``everything that had beencoming from the CIA.''   ``Everything that they had, from the little tents that theylived in ... to food, to bullets, to intelligence'' had come fromthe CIA, said North.   ``I don't recall there was any specific break point'' when allthe Contras' needs fell on his shoulders, but he was carrying theload by the time the cutoff in military aid went in effect inOctober 1984, North testified.   North recalled how he went to Casey to get bank account numbersso he would know where money to the Contras was to be funneled andwhich factions of the splintered Contra movement to contact.   Dressed in a dark suit, North sat down in the witness box sevenweeks after a jury began hearing testimony in the case.   ``So you're Colonel North,'' his attorney, Brendan Sullivan,began as the former White House aide took the stand. ``Yes sir, Iam,'' he replied with a smile.   It was disclosed earlier in North's trial that President Reaganpersonally approved a secret deal early in 1985 to funnel $110million in extra aid to Honduras in exchange for that country'ssupport for the Contras.   The deal with Honduras was one of the quid pro quo arrangementswhose details have emerged at North's trial showing how the UnitedStates secretly enlisted the aid of other countries in support ofthe Nicaraguan rebels at a time when Congress had cut off militaryaid to the Contras.   After Reagan approved the assistance, Bush, then vice president,told Honduran President Roberto Suazo ``that President Reagan haddirected expedited delivery of U.S. military items to Honduras,''said the statement read by North's lawyer.   ``Vice President Bush also informed Suazo that President Reaganhad directed that currently withheld economic assistance forHonduras should be released,'' said the statement.   Bush also said ``that the United States would provide from itsown military stocks critical security assistance items that hadbeen ordered by Honduran armed forces; and that several securityprograms under way for Honduran security forces would beenhanced,'' the statement said.   Noriega's representative offered the assassinations in mid-1986on behalf of the Panamanian leader ``in exchange for a promise''from the U.S. government ``to help clean up Noriega's image,''according to the statement.   Also to be part of the deal, according to the statement, was thelifting of a ban by the U.S. government on military sales to thePanamian defense forces.   After lengthy criminal investigations, Noriega was indicted inthe United States on Feb. 4, 1988, for alleged involvement ininternational drug trafficking.   North told the representative at the meeting that ``the U.S.government could not be involved in assassinations,'' said thestatement read by his lawyer.   The Panamanian representative pointed out that Noriega hadhelped the United States the previous year ``in blowing up aSandinista arsenal,'' the statement said.   When North told his boss, Poindexter, of the Panamanian offer,Poindexter responded, according to the statement, that the U.S.government ``could not be involved in assassination, but Panamanianassistance with sabatoge would be another story.'' Poindexterrecommended that North speak with Noriega directly, it said.   The prosecution said in a motion earlier that North should becompelled to produce his notebooks and ledgers if he testified.   North chronicled his daily activities at the National SecurityCouncil in a series of notebooks. He also kept a ledger of the useof travelers checks he received from Contra leader Adolfo Calero.North told Congress he destroyed the ledger but the prosecutorshave been under orders not to read his immunized testimony.   The government had issued a subpoena to produce the documentsMarch 3, contingent on his testifying.   Other information detailed in the statement read by North'slawyer included:   _Reagan ``urged'' the Saudi head of state in 1985 that the SaudiArabian government ``continue its support'' for the Contras.Subsequently, the Saudis gave $25 million.   _In 1983, CIA Director William Casey became involved in a secreteffort known as Operation Tipped Kettle to persuade Israel to makeavailable weapons captured from the PLO. Casey discussed the matterwith Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger.   _The CIA advised that it would use the weapons for variouspurposes. Several hundred tons of the weapons were shipped to theContras as congressionally appropriated funds to the rebels ran out.   _In 1984, under an operation known as Elephant Herd, the UnitedStates was to tell Israel it would be as flexible as posible withinthe constraints of the law ``to compensate'' Israel with aid inexchange for the weapons it had gotten from the PLO.   Earlier today, former hostage David Jacobsen testified thatNorth's eyes filled with tears following Jacobsen's release becauseother Americans held captive in Lebanon had not been released.   Jacobsen said that on a plane flight to Germany North toldJacobsen he was ``discouraged'' because the other hostages hadn'tbeen released and ``they can't enjoy the same'' happiness ``you areenjoying.''</TEXT></DOC>
