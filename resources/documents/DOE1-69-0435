The relationship between CT findings and histopathologicalfindings was also investigated in 15 of them and in additional 5 patientswith small HCC. Iso-density of the tumors was the main cause of failurein detection by either precontrast or postcontrast scan. However, mostof the tumors showing iso-density were successfully detected by combinedapplication of the both scans when the size was larger than 2 cm. DynamicCT was useful in the differential diagnosis of tumors detected, becauseit demonstrated the capsule and showed a typical dynamic pattern. However,it was not useful in the tumors with no staining. In precontrast scan,the density of tumor was closely related to bleeding, necrosis and fattydegeneration of cancer tissue, and fatty degeneration of surroundingnon-cancer tissue. Furthermore, it was indicated that the appearanceof capsule finding was related not only to the thickness of capsule butalso to fatty degeneration of surrounding non-cancer tissue. In postcontrastscan, the density of tumor was also related to bleeding, necrosis andfatty degeneration. Staining in the arterial phase of dynamic scan wasnot observed in one case of severe fatty degeneration of cancer tissue.Thus, CT is useful in the diagnosis of small HCC and may be availablefor assessment of therapeutic effects because it reflects histopathologicalchanges of HCC.</TEXT></DOC>
