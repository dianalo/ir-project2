Generale des Etablissements Michelin won another contest to keep unions out of its North American production plants.    The Nova Scotia Labor Relations Board, a government agency, said yesterday that workers at Michelin's three plants in the province voted against the Canadian Auto Workers union's being certified as their bargaining agent. The board, which counted the ballots, didn't disclose details.    The result marked the fourth defeat in 10 years for major union efforts to organize Michelin workers in Canada. Michelin also has five nonunion plants in the U.S. The previous organizing drives in Canada were made by other unions.    The Canadian Auto Workers, an aggressive breakaway union formerly associated with the United Auto Workers union, campaigned strenuously for Michelin certification. A union victory would have been a coup for its high-profile leader, Robert White. Mr. White said he was disappointed by the result.    Industry sources said some Michelin workers voted against union certification because of fears that Michelin would close its Nova Scotia plants if they were unionized. About half the plants' output is exported to the U.S.    The company, with a Nova Scotia work force of 2,900, is the largest private-sector employer in Nova Scotia. Unemployment in Nova Scotia is currently 14% of the province's work force. Michelin workers' wages are in line with those in the Canadian auto industry and higher than most in rural Nova Scotia, where the three tire plants are located.    Mr. White blamed the union's loss partly on a Nova Scotia law that has been nicknamed by some &quot;the Michelin bill&quot; because it is widely viewed as favoring the company. The law, passed in 1980, prevents unions from getting plant-by-plant recognition as bargaining agent. Unions must simultaneously seek certification from all of a company's plants in the province. </TEXT></DOC>
