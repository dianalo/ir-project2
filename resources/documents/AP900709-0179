The bad news is that ``Northern Exposure'' has no bear.   This new CBS summer series, which premieres Thursday, has onlythe young New York doctor, the small Alaskan town and anopening-show script that starts amusingly, then comes down withattack of the feebles.   This does not bode well for a one-hour series that hopes to gobeyond the eight weeks CBS is giving it.   Be that as it may, Rob Morrow stars here as a cocky New Yorkyuppie _ pardon the redundancy _ fresh out of Columbia MedicalSchool. His first job is in Alaska because that state, in need ofdoctors, financed his education.   In return, he must work there for four years. Leaving behind hislaw-school fiancee, he nervously arrives in Anchorage, bearing golfclubs and telling a state official he needs a few days to get acondo, cable TV and such.   Er, we now have too many doctors, the official says. But thestate will set him up in the backwoods hamlet of Cicely. The youngsawbones, falsely told he can leave the town if he doesn't like it,decides to give it a shot.   Thus is the stage set for a clash of cultures, the big-city kidused to bright lights and brie versus the sturdy, stoic inmates ofa world so removed from New York that one inhabitant even asks,``What's a bagel?''   Well, sure as heck, the new sawbones wants out. With seven showsto go, though, you can safely lay 100-to-1 odds he won't make it.   Some observers might contend that ``Northern Exposure'' is afaint echo of ABC's ``Twin Peaks,'' which also is set in a smallbackwoods town. Not so. For one thing, ``Twin Peaks'' occurs inWashington State.   For another, ``Peaks'' has stoplights. ``Exposure'' doesn't. Andthere is no murdered homecoming queen in CBS' show (althoughsuppose its homecoming queen is a bear? Naaaah).   However, like ``Peaks,'' ``Exposure'' does have characters whoare a little ... eccentric. One even is a kid who wears a blackleather jacket and whose black hair is parted in the middle.   Another is a woman who brings a sick beaver in for treatment,saying, ``I think his teeth hurt.'' There's also a man who, shot inthe leg by his wife, explains, ``She said, `Loud doesn't work withme anymore.' ''   There's a beautiful charter pilot, a native of wealthy GrossePoint, Mich., whose true love froze to death on a glacier. And atavern owner whose best friend vows to shoot him dead if the latterever speaks to him.   This is because, the bar owner (John Cullum) explains, hisfriend imported a beautiful young woman to marry, but one day sheshowed up alone at his bar, ``and said if I wanted her, she wasmine.'' A pause. ``I did.''   The friend (Barry Corbin), a middle-aged former astronaut, owns15,000 acres, the town newspaper and its radio station. He'sCicley's biggest booster and, it turns out, ready to do harm to itsnew doctor if he tries to leave.   ``We've got an outstanding little town here, Joel, ready to stepup in the world,'' he says when they first meet. ``We've gotnatural resources, we've got land, we've got wildlife just waitingto be fondled.''   Despite such strangeness, these characters are basically decentfolk and have none of the deapan madness of the ``Twin Peaks''citizenry.   Morrow, as the young doctor, is very good, even in a script thatafter a few nice touches of whimsy just sort of wanders off to afinale featuring a town festival where our hero munches morosely ona mooseburger.   In a way, `Northern Exposure'' may remind some of ``LocalHero,'' a 1983 film about a Texas oil yuppie who finds the meaningof life while on business in a remote seacoast town in Scotland.   But that clash-of-cultures exercise was both funny and moving.   CBS' Alaskan expedition, created by ``St. Elsewhere'' creatorsJoshua Brand and John Falsey, is more like what happens when youeat a mooseburger. It's mildly interesting at the start, and thenit just sits there.</TEXT><TEXT>   Elsewhere in television ...
