Strikes, inflation and interest rates _ the economic diseasesMrs. Thatcher has fought for 10 years to eradicate _ are hauntingBritain again, and now comes a trouncing for her Conservative Partyin European Parliament elections.   The government, while admitting its dismay, insists this doesn'tmean the end for Mrs. Thatcher's free-market crusade. It says votersalways use elections to the European Parliament to register protestagainst governments in midterm, and that the turnout of 36 percentis too low to shape lasting judgments.   Nonetheless, the opposition Labor Party is jubilant, having wonits first national election victory since 1974. Labor has emergedwith 45 of the 78 mainland British constituencies and the Tories 32,fully overturning the 45-32 advantage the Tories held in the 1984Euro-election.   Labor, having revamped some of its more stridently left-wingpolicies to broaden its appeal, has ``been making steady progresssince early this year,'' said the party's foreign policy chief,Gerald Kaufman.   ``I like the pace of it _ don't want to go too fast, don't want asurge that can fall again'' before before Britain's next electionwhich must be held by June 1992, he said.   On Thursday, Labor won both seats in two special elections forvacancies in the House of Commons _ in London and in Glasgow,Scotland.   Conservatives called both districts ``safe'' Labor seats that theparty should have won. In the Vauxhall district of London, Labor'sKate Hoey increased the party's majority. In Glasgow Central, Laborhalted a challenge by the Scottish National Party, and its candidateMike Wilson won with a reduced but respectable majority.   Former Prime Minister Edward Heath, an outspoken Thatcher foe inthe Conservative Party, believed she was in serious trouble, saying:   ``If after 10 years of government you've still got nearly 2million unemployed, you've got an overall deficit on your trade andother dealings of 15 billion pounds ($23 billion), you've gotinterest rates up to 14 percent and you've got inflation up to 8.3percent and rising, then people are bound to say ... is this reallywhat we want?''   Energy Secretary Cecil Parkinson said: ``We recognize all thosethings. We agree that inflation is a great curse. We're tackling it,and one isn't popular while one is serving up the medicine.''   The inflation is widely ascribed to Thatcherism's own success inreviving the economy through tax cuts, deregulation, sellingnationalized industries, abolishing foreign currency controls andcurbing trade union rights.   The result has been a national spending spree, a sharp increasein the trade deficit, bigger wage demands and higher interest rates.   The unrest triggered by rising wage demands has raised the numberof worker days lost to strikes from 38,000 in December to 82,000 inApril. Wage increases are running at 9.3 percent, compared with 7.5percent two years ago. On Wednesday, Britain faces its firstnational rail strike since 1982.   A wage-inflation spiral would be a nightmare for any government.But even more trouble awaits Mrs. Thatcher over her plans to shakeup the legal, teaching and health services, her widely unpopularproperty tax reform and her insistence on privatizing the nationalwater and electricity industries.   Voters may also have been put off by her combative stance towardthe European Economic Community, which she has portrayed as abureaucracy bent on forcing socialism down the British throat.   ``I think the general public are fed up with Euro-bashing,'' saidHeath.   Despite Thatcherism's difficulties, no neutral observer is readyto write her off. Mrs. Thatcher has hit low patches before, hersupporters say, yet she remains the only British prime minister inmore than 160 years to win three consecutive elections.   Strikes may be recurring, but the number of days lost is nothingnear the 30 million in the last year before she ousted Labor in1979. Inflation has yet to approach the double-digit permanency ofthe years immediately before Mrs. Thatcher's ascent.   Many voters seem to feel that having spent 10 years tacklingBritain's real problems, she is now attacking non-existent demons.On issues like health and water a widespread feeling prevails of``if it ain't broke, don't fix it.''   Simon Jenkins, writing in the pro-Thatcher Sunday Times, said theEuro-vote, and the surprising 15 percent share of the vote won bythe environmentalist Green Party, reflected a yearning for acommunity spirit that has suffered in the hardheaded enterpriseculture favored by Mrs. Thatcher.   Everywhere, he said, voters were distressed by what they perceiveas a deregulating spirit gone too far _ from the government'srefusal to impose dog licenses to combat a wave of dog attacks, tothe ease with which entrepreneurs can knock down historic buildingsand put up bland office blocks.   Mrs. Thatcher, he concluded, ``must reconstruct late-Thatcherismand must do so urgently.''</TEXT><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE><TEXT>   Marcus Eliason, The AP's London news editor, hasbeen covering Britain for 5{ years.</TEXT></DOC>
