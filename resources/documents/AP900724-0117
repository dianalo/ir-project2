The vice foreign minister, Jose R. Viera, demanded the``unconditional and voluntary'' departure of the 25 Cubans nowbeing sheltered at three European embassies.   On Sunday, three Cubans entered the Swiss Embassy. Earlier, 18had sought refuge at the Spanish Embassy and four at the ItalianEmbassy.   Viera said it is ``not admissible'' for a Cuban desiring toemigrate to circumvent normal procedures by forcing his way into aforeign embassy.   If Cuba acquiesced in this practice, ``the embassies in Cubawould not be able to function'' and embassies throughout the ThirdWorld might be overrun by people wishing to emigrate, Viera said.   At several points during his hourlong talk, Viera blamed exileradio stations in Miami for inciting the incidents at theembassies. The first incident occurred at the Czechoslovak Embassyon July 9.   Cuban reports said at least three of the exile radio stationscan often be heard clearly in Havana but the Cuban reports wereunable to substantiate Viera's claims that they have been beenencouraging Cubans to seek refuge.   The reporters said one of the stations is operated by theCuban-American National Foundation. Another is run by a groupcalled Cuba Independent and Democratic, they said.   Viera sought to portray the incidents at the embassies asunrepresentative of the overall situation here.   He said the annual carnival celebration this week has beenproceeding normally. The events at the embassies have led to asubstantial increase in security around many diplomatic missions ofNATO countries.   The highlight of the carnival celebration is a speech Thursdayby President Fidel Castro commemorating the 37th anniversary of hisdebut as a rebel fighter. Castro took power in Cuba in 1959.   The incident at the Spanish Embassy has led to a deteriorationin Cuba's relations with Madrid.   While Cuba has called the asylum-seekers ``scum'' and habitualvagrants and said it will never allow them to leave the island,Spain has said it will not expel the Cubans and will try instead tonegotiate their departure.   Last week, reflecting escalating tensions between the twocountries, Spain suspended a $2.5 million aid program to Cuba,recalled its ambassador and sent four guards to bolster security atits embassy in Havana.   Spain's foreign minister, Francisco Fernandez Ordonez, had saidCastro is afraid his hard-line Communist government will fall likethose in Eastern Europe if he allows Cubans to leave. FernandezOrdonez also urged a transition to democracy in Cuba.   The wave of embassy break-ins began two weeks ago, not longafter similar incidents were occurring at foreign embassies inAlbania. Albania, like Cuba, is a hard-line Communist state.</TEXT></DOC>
