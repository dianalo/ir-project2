The legislation, on which debate began in Manila this week,would prohibit nuclear weapons at the two major U.S. military basesin the Philippines and would ban port calls by U.S. warships andplanes carrying such arms.   State Department spokesman Charles Redman said the United Stateshad told the Philippines that the bill ``would permit noflexibility on nuclear matters and would be incompatible'' withU.S. policy.   That policy prohibits the United States from revealing whetherits ships and planes are carrying nuclear weapons.   Redman declined to further discuss the Philippine legislation,saying it was still in its early stages. The bill is expected topass the 23-member Senate, but would face strong opposition in the200-member lower house.   The United States has expressed strong opposition to such bansin other countries. It expelled New Zealand from a Pacific defensealliance with Australia after New Zealand adopted a nuclear ban,and has protested similar action being considered in Denmark.</TEXT></DOC>
