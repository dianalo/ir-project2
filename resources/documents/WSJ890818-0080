New York-based Citicorp said a Budapest-based financing affiliate yesterday completed a 700 million Hungarian forints ($12 million) management buyout of state-owned stationery supplier Apisz. The buyers are an investor group led by senior and middle managers of the 730-employee company. Most of the work force also are buying a stake, either directly or through an employee stock plan, Citicorp said.    Citicorp, which financed the transaction, will retain more than a one-third holding in the company, a retail-paper supplier based in Budapest with about $86 million in annual sales. And the U.S. bank believes the transaction could eventually lead to more Western-style deals in the future.    Hungary has been in the vanguard of Eastern bloc nations in opening up its centrally planned economy to greater individual initiative and market forces. The transaction &quot;was made possible by recent changes in Hungarian legislation through which the government is actively encouraging the privatization of state-owned enterprises,&quot; Citicorp said. In one of these recent changes, such companies have been allowed to recapitalize as joint-stock companies, in which outside investors are allowed to hold a stake. </TEXT></DOC>
