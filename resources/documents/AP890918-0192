Schwarz.</TEXT><BYLINE>By JO ASTRID GLADING</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>DOVER TOWNSHIP, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Never mind how Scott Chinery made hismoney. Consider instead that he claims the largest collection ofpre-Castro Cuban cigars this side of Havana.   He counts between 11,000 to 12,000 of them, some 30 to 40different brands.   Add to that about 100 guitars, dozens of valuable watches, 14expensive cars, up to 3,500 comic books _ including first editionsof Batman and Superman _ and a Batmobile and a Batcycle with sidecarfrom the 1960s television series. The latter two items cost him$240,000, but with Batmania revived by the new movie he says he'sbeen offered $2 million for the car alone. He isn't selling.   In short, Scott Chinery, a multimillionaire by age 29, is largerthan life.   In fact, he's 6-feet-6 inches tall, weighs in at 275 pounds.Shaking his hand is like grabbing hold of a small ham.   He'd be smaller today, but as a kid he wanted to be bigger, and acollege football coach told him steroids would do it. He quicklyadded 25 more pounds of muscle to an already impressive frame.   That's how he made his money, selling what he calls a safealternative to steroids to others, who, like him, want to be biggerthan nature intended.   The Batmobile investment brought him fame faster than steroidsput muscles on a 98-pound weakling.   ``Want to go for a ride in the Batmobile?'' he offers. ``You canbe Robin.''   A visitor to his palatial garage has to step past the Bentleyconvertible, the Rolls-Royce, the Lamborghini Countash and the 1958Thunderbird before getting to the sleek, black piece of televisionAmericana.   The Bentley, incidentally, sports a $40,000 sound system, thefloor strewn with compact discs, including his favorites, the Judds.``I'm in love with Naomi Judd,'' he confesses. The rest of his cars,a mint condition 1962 VW bug and a 1961 Corvette among them, arewarehoused.   The Batmobile, Chinery's prize possession, still bears its``Gotham City'' license plates. Its sister vehicle, the only otherin existence, remains impounded in Australia where it was involvedin an accident.   But at the risk of disappointing middle-age Bat fans, theBatmobile is a stretch Thunderbird (14 inches longer), laden withwhat are nothing more than Bat props.   The red Bat Phone is just a metal facsimile held to the holder bya magnet. The Bat Chute is just a red button. So are the Bat Ram,the Bat Ray, the Bat Scanner, the Bat Detect-A-Scope and theautomatic tire repair.   It's a virtual Bat sham. Only the television works, and it'sblack-and-white.   New York developer Donald Trump called one day to ask for a ridein the Batmobile and Chinery agreed to a three block spin, from thePlaza Hotel to the Trump Tower, providing Trump returned the favorwith a ride in his helicopter.   As they soared over Manhattan, Chinery recounts, ``He said, `I'llshow you what I own,''' promptly pointing out just about everythingin sight.   Now Chinery is ready to roll, but the Batmobile is out of gas. Heruns down the battery trying to start it.   Like a kid with lots of toys but a short attention span, he moveson to other pursuits and asks his aides to push it out of thegarage, pump some gas and give it a jump-start from the Batcycle.   A ruthless practical joker, Chinery's home security system hasone camera trained on the front door. To torment visitors, he canhit a button next to his desk and spray the unsuspecting callerswith water.   For his daughter's first birthday, he ordered a full-fledgedcircus for the back yard.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
