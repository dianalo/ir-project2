Background </ITAG>Pursuant to Public Law (P.L.) 97-415, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission(the Commission) is publishing this regular biweekly notice. P.L. 97-415revised section 189 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act),to require the Commission to publish notice of any amendments issued, orproposed to be issued, under a new provision of section 189 of the Act.This provision grants the Commission the authority to issue and make immediatelyeffective any amendment to an operating license upon a determination bythe Commission that such amendment involves no significant hazards consideration,notwithstanding the pendency before the Commission of a request for a hearingfrom any person. This biweekly notice includes all notices of amendments issued, or proposedto be issued from May 18, 1989 through June 2, 1989. The last biweeklynotice was published on May 31, 1989 (54 FR 23306). <ITAG tagnum="84">NOTICE OF CONSIDERATION OF ISSUANCE OF AMENDMENT TO FACILITY OPERATINGLICENSE AND PROPOSED NO SIGNIFICANT HAZARDS CONSIDERATION DETERMINATIONAND OPPORTUNITY FOR HEARING </ITAG>The Commission has made a proposed determination that the following amendmentrequests involve no significant hazards consideration. Under the Commission'sregulations in 10 CFR 50.92, this means that operation of the facilityin accordance with the proposed amendments would not (1) involve a significantincrease in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated;or (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident fromany accident previously evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reductionin a margin of safety. The basis for this proposed determination for eachamendment request is shown below. The Commission is seeking public comments on this proposed determination.Any comments received within 30 days after the date of publication of thisnotice will be considered in making any final determination. The Commissionwill not normally make a final determination unless it receives a requestfor a hearing. Written comments may be submitted by mail to the Regulatory PublicationsBranch, Division of Freedom of Information and Publications Services, Officeof Administration and Resources Management, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,Washington, DC 20555, and should cite the publication date and page numberof this <T4>Federal Register </T4>notice. Written comments may also be deliveredto Room P-216, Phillips Building, 7920 Norfolk Avenue, Bethesda, Marylandfrom 7:30 a.m. to 4:15 p.m. Copies of written comments received may beexamined at the NRC Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street,NW., Washington, DC. The filing of requests for hearing and petitions forleave to intervene is discussed below. By July 14, 1989 the licensee may file a request for a hearing with respectto issuance of the amendment to the subject facility operating licenseand any person whose interest may be affected by this proceeding and whowishes to participate as a party in the proceeding must file a writtenpetition for leave to intervene. Requests for a hearing and petitions forleave to intervene shall be filed in accordance with the Commission's ``Rulesof Practice for Domestic Licensing Proceedings'' in 10 CFR Part 2. If arequest for a hearing or petition for leave to intervene is filed by theabove date, the Commission or an Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, designatedby the Commission or by the Chairman of the Atomic Safety and LicensingBoard Panel, will rule on the request and/or petition and the Secretaryor the designated Atomic Safety and Licensing Board will issue a noticeof hearing or an appropriate order. As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition for leave to intervene shall setforth with particularity the interest of the petitioner in the proceeding,and how that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding.The petition should specifically explain the reasons why intervention shouldbe permitted with particular reference to the following factors: (1) thenature of the petitioner's right under the Act to be made a party to theproceeding; (2) the nature and extent of the petitioner's property, financial,or other interest in the proceeding; and (3) the possible effect of anyorder which may be entered in the proceeding on the petitioner's interest.The petition should also identify the specific aspect(s) of the subjectmatter of the proceeding as to which petitioner wishes to intervene. Anyperson who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or who has beenadmitted as a party may amend the petition without requesting leave ofthe Board up to fifteen (15) days prior to the first prehearing conferencescheduled in the proceeding, but such an amended petition must satisfythe specificity requirements described above. Not later than fifteen (15) days prior to the first prehearing conferencescheduled in the proceeding, a petitioner shall file a supplement to thepetition to intervene which must include a list of the contentions whichare sought to be litigated in the matter, and the bases for each contentionset forth with reasonable specificity. Contentions shall be limited tomatters within the scope of the amendment under consideration. A petitionerwho fails to file such a supplement which satisfies these requirementswith respect to at least one contention will not be permitted to participateas a party. Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, subjectto any limitations in the order granting leave to intervene, and have theopportunity to participate fully in the conduct of the hearing, includingthe opportunity to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses. If a hearing is requested, the Commission will make a final determinationon the issue of no significant hazards consideration. The final determinationwill serve to decide when the hearing is held. If the final determination is that the amendment request involves no significanthazards consideration, the Commission may issue the amendment and makeit immediately effective, notwithstanding the request for a hearing. Anyhearing held would take place after issuance of the amendment. If the final determination is that the amendment involves a significanthazards consideration, any hearing held would take place before the issuanceof any amendment. Normally, the Commission will not issue the amendment until the expirationof the 30-day notice period. However, should circumstances change duringthe notice period such that failure to act in a timely way would result,for example, in derating or shutdown of the facility, the Commission mayissue the license amendment before the expiration of the 30-day noticeperiod, provided that its final determination is that the amendment involvesno significant hazards consideration. The final determination will considerall public and State comments received before action is taken. Should theCommission take this action, it will publish a notice of issuance and providefor opportunity for a hearing after issuance. The Commission expects thatthe need to take this action will occur very infrequently. A request for a hearing or a petition for leave to intervene must be filedwith the Secretary of the Commission, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,Washington, DC 20555, Attention: Docketing and Service Branch, or may bedelivered to the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building,2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC, by the above date. Where petitionsare filed during the last ten (10) days of the notice period, it is requestedthat the petitioner promptly so inform the Commission by a toll-free telephonecall to Western Union at 1-(800) 325-6000 (in Missouri 1-(800) 342-6700).The Western Union operator should be given Datagram Identification Number3737 and the following message addressed to (<T3>Project Director</T3>): petitioner's name and telephone number; datepetition was mailed; plant name; and publication date and page number ofthis <T4>Federal Register </T4>notice. A copy of the petition should also besent to the Office of the General Counsel, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,Washington, DC 20555, and to the attorney for the licensee. Nontimely filings of petitions for leave to intervene, amended petitions,supplemental petitions and/or requests for hearing will not be entertainedabsent a determination by the Commission, the presiding officer or thepresiding Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, that the petition and/or requestshould be granted based upon a balancing of factors specified in 10 CFR2.714(a)(1)(i)-(v) and 2.714(d). For further details with respect to this action, see the application foramendment which is available for public inspection at the Commission'sPublic Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington,DC, and at the local public document room for the particular facility involved.<ITAG tagnum="84">Carolina Power andamp; Light Company, et al., Docket Nos. 50-325 and50-324, Brunswick Steam Electric Plant, Units 1 and 2, Brunswick County,North Carolina </ITAG><T3>Date of application for amendments: </T3>April 28, 1989. <T3>Description of amendment request: </T3>The proposed amendments woulddelete the organization charts from Technical Specifications (TS), incorporateorganizational changes to Section 6.0, Administrative Controls, and updateTS Section 6.5.4.9 to reflect current 10 CFR 50.72 and 10 CFR 50.73 reportingrequirements. <T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazard consideration determination:</T3>The Commission has provided standards for determining whether a nosignificant hazard consideration exists as stated in 10 CFR 50.92(c). Aproposed amendment to an operating license involves no significant hazardsconsideration if operation of the facility in accordance with the proposedamendment would not: (1) involve a significant increase in the probabilityor consequences of an accident previously evaluated; or (2) create thepossibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previouslyevaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.The Carolina Power andamp; Light Company (CPandamp;L) has reviewed the proposedchanges to the Brunswick Steam Electric Plant Technical Specificationsand has determined that the requested amendment does not involve a significanthazards consideration for the following reasons: <ITAG tagnum="21">1. The proposed amendment does not involve a significant increasein the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluatedbecause deletion of the organization charts, updating of individual titles,and removal of two Plant Nuclear Safety Committee (PNSC) members from theTechnical Specifications does not affect plant operation. As in the past,the NRC will continue to be informed of organizational changes throughother required controls. The Code of Federal Regulations, Title 10, Part50.34(b)(6)(i) requires that the organizational structure be included inthe Final Safety Analysis Report (FSAR). Chapter 13 of the FSAR providesa description of the organization and detailed organization charts. Asrequired by 10CFR5071(e), the company submits annual updates to the FSAR.Appendix B to 10CFR50 and 10 CFR 50.54(a)(3) govern changes to the organizationdescribed in the Quality Assurance Program. Some of these organizationalchanges require prior NRC approval. Also, it is CPandamp;L's practice toinform the NRC of organizational changes affecting the nuclear facilitiesprior to implementation. The company intends to continue this practicefor future organizational changes. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. The proposed amendment does not create the possibility of a newor different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated becausethe proposed changes are administrative in nature and involve no physicalalterations of plant configuration or changes to setpoint or operatingparameters. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">3. The proposed amendment does not involve a significant reductionin the margin of safety because CPandamp;L, through its Quality AssurancePrograms, its commitment to maintain only qualified personnel in positionsof responsibility, and other required controls assure that safety functionswill be performed at a high level of competence. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Therefore, removal of the organization charts from the Technical Specificationswill not affect the margin of safety. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Also, revising Section 6.0 to reflect current organization by revisingindividual titles, removing two Plant Nuclear Safety [Committee] (PNSC)members, and adjusting the quorum requirements will not affect the functionof the organization or PNSC. The PNSC will continue to review, overview,evaluate, and maintain plant operational safety; therefore, the marginof safety will not be affected. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Updating the Technical Specifications to reflect current 10 CFR 50.72and 10 CFR 50.73 reporting requirements which superseded the old reportingrequirement of 24-hour written notification will not affect the marginof safety. </ITAG>The licensee has concluded that the proposed amendment meets the threestandards in 10 CFR 50.92 and, therefore, involves no significant hazardsconsideration. The NRC staff has made a preliminary review of the licensee's no significanthazards consideration determination and agrees with the licensee's analysis.In addition, the NRC staff has observed from the proposed amendment thattwo members to be removed from the PNSC quorum are: Manager of Technicaland Administrative Support and Assistant to Plant General Manager. Thesetwo positions had been dissolved due to a recent reorganization; however,the technical expertise on the PNSC quorum remains the same as before and,therefore, the effectiveness of the PNSC to evaluate changes to the plantoperational safety issues will not be affected. Accordingly, the Commissionproposes to determine that the requested amendment does not involve a significanthazards consideration. <T3>Local Public Document Room location: </T3>University of North Carolinaat Wilmington, William Madison Randall Library, 601 S.

Currently, the licensee canonly use the ``Mass Point'' method, in accordance with the Technical Specifications.Appendix J permits the Total Time method, the Point-to-Point method, orthe Mass Point method. The modified technical specification would simplyreference Appendix J. <T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazard consideration determination:</T3>The Commission has provided standards for determining whether a nosignificant hazard consideration exists as stated in 10 CFR 50.92(c). Aproposed amendment to an operating license involves no significant hazardsconsideration if operation of the facility in accordance with the proposedamendment would not: (1) involve a significant increase in the probabilityor consequences of an accident previously evaluated; or (2) create thepossibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previouslyevaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.The Carolina Power andamp; Light Company (CPandamp;L) has reviewed the proposedchanges to TS and has determined that the requested amendment does notinvolve a significant hazards consideration for the following reasons:<ITAG tagnum="21">1. The proposed amendment does not involve a significant increasein the probability of any accident previously evaluated. ANSI N45.4-1972specified data analysis methodologies (Total Time or Point-to-Point), ANSI/ANS56.8-1987 specified Mass Point data analysis methodology, and BN-TOP-1,Revision 1, specified reduced duration criteria, using the Total Time dataanalysis method. Each of these is an NRC Staff endorsed methodology forthe calculation of primary containment integrated leakage rates duringtests. These methods, or any other calculational method used to determinecontainment leakage rate during testing, are not considered to be an initiatorof any accident previously evaluated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The proposed amendment does not involve a significant increase inthe consequences of any accident previously evaluated. As stated in 10CFR50,Appendix J, the purpose of the required tests is to assure that ``...leakagethrough the primary reactor containment and systems and components penetratingprimary containment shall not exceed allowable leakage rate values...''10CFR50, Appendix J endorses the data analysis methodologies (Total Timeand Point-to-Point) specified in ANSI N45.4-1972 as well as the Mass Pointmethod specified in ANSI/ANS 56.8-1987. Thus, the proposed change meetsthe purpose of the rule and therefore, does not significantly increasethe consequences of a previously evaluated accident. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. The proposed amendment does not create the possibility of a newor different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. Theproposed amendment only provides for the use of NRC Staff endorsed andapproved methodologies for the calculation of containment leakage ratesduring tests. No possibility of a new or different kind of accident iscreated since the technique used to calculate leak rates during tests,in itself, it not considered to be an initiator of an accident, transient,incident, or event. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">3. The proposed amendment does not involve a significant reductionin the margin of safety. The proposed amendment allows BSEP to use eitherBN-TOP-1, Revision 1, which requires use of the Total Time method whenperforming reduced duration tests, or the Mass Point method with a minimumtest duration of 24 hours. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">As stated in the NRC February 17, 1988 SER, ``The Mass Point methodhas been recognized by the professional community as superior to the twoother methods, Point-to-Point and Total Time, which are referenced in ANSIN45.4-1972 and endorsed by the current regulations.'' The preference isbased on the fact that the Total Time method is dependent on selectionof the first point and it's [sic] relation to the remaining points, whilethe Mass Point method places equal emphasis on each point. Therefore, withthe Mass Point method, an error in the first point is not as critical.This means that the upper 95% confidence interval of the leakage for theTotal Time method may be higher than that of the Mass Point method. However,this does not decrease the margin of safety in that the acceptance criteriaof an integrated leak rate test is based on leakage at the upper 95% confidenceinterval being less than the acceptance criteria. Therefore, any data scatterin the Total Time method is accounted for in the statistical analysis andmust be within set limits for the test to pass. Such an error would typicallyyield test results which would pass using the Mass Point method, but wouldnot pass using the Total Time method. Thus, to successfully perform a reducedduration BN-TOP-1, Revision 1, test, the test data must be more consistentthan what is required for successful performance of a Mass Point test.For this reaason, CPandamp;L has concluded that the propsed amendment doesnot significantly decrease the margin of safety. </ITAG>The licensee has concluded that the proposed amendment meets the threestandards in 10 CFR 50.92 and, therefore, involves no significant hazardsconsideration. The NRC staff has made a preliminary review of the licensee's no significanthazards consideration determination and agrees with the licensee's analysis.Appendix J permits the use of any one of the three test methods. The TSchange will reference Appendix J. Accordingly, the Commission proposesto determine that the requested amendment does not involve a significanthazards consideration. <T3>Local Public Document Room location: </T3>University of North Carolinaat Wilmington, William Madison Randall Library, 601 S.

Operation of the facility, in accordance with the proposed amendment,would not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequencesof an accident previously analyzed because the testing proposed is performedwhile the reactor is in cold shutdown/refueling and the systems testedare not required to be operable. In addition, there is no accident previouslyanalyzed that is initiated by the AFW or SW systems components involved.Also, since no accidents for which AFW provides a mitigation function occurwhile the reactor is in cold shutdown/refueling, no accident consequencescan increase. The SW valve involved is redundant to other valves whichisolate cooling to the nonsafety-related secondary system plant auxiliariesfollowing a station blackout coincident with a Safety Injection actuationto minimize the non-safety loads on SW during that event. The testing tobe performed is done at a time when accidents coincident with station blackoutare not postulated, therefore, no accident consequences can be increased.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. Operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendmentwould not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accidentfrom any accident previously evaluated because no changes to existing equipmentare involved, and the breakers being tested and their associated valveswill be verified operable prior to returning the plant to a condition requiringtheir operability, therefore, no failure mechanisms are introduced. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">3. Operation of the facility, in accordance with the proposed amendment,would not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety since thetesting noted will not alter any accident mitigating function required,and assures the breakers will perform their intended function. The existingmargin of safety is preserved. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In addition, the proposed amendment is similar to Example ii of amendmentslikely to involve no significant hazards consideration: ``[a] change thatconstitutes an additional ... control not presently included in the technicalspecifications,'' as published in the Federal Register on March 6, 1986.</ITAG>The licensee has concluded that the proposed amendment meets the threestandards in 10 CFR 50.92 and, therefore, involves no significant hazardsconsideration.

The proposed changes relate only to the consequences of an accidentas they do not in any way impact the manner in which any systems or componentsinvolved in the initiation of an accident function. To evaluate the impacton consequences, three distinct areas are covered: 1) maintaining the fuelrack Keff less than or equal to 0.95; 2) maximum heat load generated bythe fuel in the fuel pools; and 3) impact on radiological dose. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The proposed change specifies a new Technical Specification requirementon the maximum reactivity an assembly may have at any time in its life.Credit can be taken for burnable poison integral to the fuel in determiningan assembly's reactivity. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">This new requirement assures that Keff will remain below 0.95 in thefuel racks; therefore, the consequences of storage of higher enriched fuelremains unchanged. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">An evaluation has been performed to determine the impact of higherenriched fuel on the pool heat load analysis presented in the FSAR. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">An evaluation assuming batch average discharge exposures up to 50,000MWD/MTU (lead rod exposures of 60,000 MWD/MTU) has shown that the currentheat loads assumed in the FSAR remain bounding. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Westinghouse has performed an evaluation to determine the potentialimpact of higher enrichment (and burnup) on the radiological consequencesof the accidents presented in the FSAR. They have concluded that the impactof enrichments up to 5.0 w/o and lead rod burnups up to 60,000 MWD/MTUcan be bounded by assuming a 4 percent increase in radiological dose. Thepotential increase in consequences is not significant based on the largemargins to the 10CFR100 limits present in the existing analyses. Furthermore,it is concluded that if one takes into consideration that the current FSARanalyses are based on a power level of 2900 MWT (for determining fissionproduct inventory in the gap) instead of 2775 MWT, the current FSAR radiologicaldose consequences are bounding. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The changes to the numbering sequence of Section 5.6.1 are administrativein nature and, therefore, cannot involve an increase in the probabilityor consequences of an accident previously evaluated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2.

According to 10 CFR 50.92(c),a proposed amendment to an operating license involves no significant safetyhazards considerations if operation of the facility in accordance withthe proposed amendment would not: 1. Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequence ofan accident previously evaluated; or 2. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from anyaccident previously evaluated; or 3. Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The proposed amendment removes motor-related valves OSX063A and OSX063Bfrom Technical Specification Tables 3.8-2a and 3.8-2b. A modification wasperformed which converted the valves from motor-operated valves to manualvalves by removing the electrical connections. The valves are maintainedlocked open and no longer require thermal overload protection devices and,therefore, do not meet the criteria for inclusion in Specification 3.8.4.2.The basis for operability of the thermal overload protective devices onmotor-operated valves is to ensure that these devices will not preventsafety related valves from performing their function. These valves arethe essential service water inlet valves to the control room chillers.These valves were originally designed to isolate essential service waterfrom the chillers if the essential service water temperature was near freezing.It has been determined that this function was not necessary because essentialservice water temperatures during winter conditions do not decrease toa point requiring chiller isolation. The modification converted the motor-operatedvalves to manual locked open valves, thereby, ensuring an essential servicewater supply to the control room chillers and minimizing the potentialof an electrical or mechanical failure interrupting the water supply. Sincethe valves perform their required function and no longer have thermal overloadprotective devices, the proposed amendment does not involve a significantincrease in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.The proposed amendment does not create the possibility of a new or differentkind of accident from any accident previously analyzed. The proposed amendmentis essentially administrative in nature, removing valves from a TechnicalSpecification table that no longer applies. This amendment does not affectthe valves' functional ability to provide essential service water to thecontrol room chillers. The proposed amendment does not involve a significant reduction in themargin of safety. The change to the Technical Specifications is administrativeand does not affect a margin of safety. Converting the valves from motor-operatedto manual locked open enhances their reliability to provide essential servicewater to the control room chillers, since the service water supply pathis less susceptible to electrical or mechanical failures. Therefore, based upon the above analysis, the staff concludes that theproposed amendment to the Technical Specification does not involve a significanthazards consideration. <T3>Local Public Document Room location: </T3>The Rockford Public Library,215 N.

As orginally submitted,the proposed amendment would remove excessive testing requirements forother systems or subsystems of the Emergency Core Cooling Systems or StandbyGas Treatment Systems when one system or subsystem is inoperable. The currentsupplement to the original submittal provides clarification to the wordingof the footnote in proposed Table 4.5.1 concerning High Pressure CoolantInjection (HPCI) surveillance requirements and clarification of how theproposed amendment meets the intent of Standardized Technical SpecificationSection 4.5.1 provisions related to the Emergency Core Cooling System line``keep fill'' requirements and valve position verifications. In addition,the following two changes were requested in this submittal to be addedto the proposed amendment. One change proposes that a surveillance requirement(SR) be added to the Containment Cooling Service Water System (CCSW), toassure system readiness that is similar to the Standard Technical Specificationfor the Residual Heat Removal Service Water System (STS SR 4.5.1.a.3).The second change which is purely administrative inserts the words ``notused'' under Section 3/4.5.G to indicate that it was deleted by a previousamendment. <T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3>The Commission has provided standards for determining whether a significanthazards consideration exists as stated in 10 CFR 50.92(c). A proposed amendmentto an operating license for a facility involves no significant hazardsconsiderations if operation of the facility in accordance with the proposedamendment would not; (1) involve a significant increase in the probabilityor consequences of an accident previously evaluated; (2) create the possibilityof a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated;or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The licensee addressed the above three standards in the amendment applicationas follows: <ITAG tagnum="21">(1)Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequencesof an accident previously evaluated because: </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The additional LCO action statement for the HPCI system and proposedSR for the CCSW system aid in the early detection of potential inoperabilityof essential systems. These additions and the Technical Specification Section3/4.5.G administrative change will not affect the probability of any accidentpreviously evaluated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2)Create the possibility of a proposed or different kind of accidentfrom any previously evaluated because: </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">No new modes of operation will be created by these changes nor willthe plant be allowed to operate beyond prescribed limits. These supplementalchanges to the previously proposed amendment are all enhancements or administrativein nature. Therefore, the probability of new or different accidents hasnot been created. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(3)Involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety because:Implementing the proposed supplemental changes will not create any challengeto the existing safety analyses. The addition of valve position verificationscan only aid in the early detection of inoperability of the CCSW system.The proposed HPCI system LCO action statement will not allow reactor startupto continue until HPCI operability is assured. The Technical SpecificationSection 3/4.5.G change is purely administrative. Therefore, the marginof safety is maintained. </ITAG>The staff has reviewed the licensee's no significant hazards analyses givenabove. Based on this review, the staff proposes to determine that the proposedamendments meet the three 10 CFR 50.92(c) standards and do not involvea significant hazards consideration. <T3>Local Public Document Room location: </T3>Morris Public Library, 604Liberty Street, Morris, Illinois 60450. <T3>Attorney for licensee: </T3>Michael L.

Operation of Indian Point Unit 2 in accordance with these changeswould not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequencesof an accident previously evaluated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The proposed Technical Specification test requirement is currentlyrequired by the February 11, 1980 Confirmatory Order Item A.5. This proposedamendment merely transfers the test requirement from the Confirmatory Orderto the Indian Point Unit 2 Technical Specifications. Moreover, the consequencesof doing or not doing this testing have been previously reviewed by NRCin various submittals; namely our March 14, 1980 response to NRC's February25, 1980 Generic Letter ``LWR Primary Coolant System Pressure IsolationValves, and NRC's Confirmatory Order dated February 11, 1980 and subsequentCommission rescission of that Order dated July 5, 1985. By committing totest the SIS low head injection line check valves 897A-D and the RHR checkvalves 838A-D whenever RCS pressure has decreased to within 100 psig ofthe RHR system design pressure, the probability of coincident disc ruptureof the two series check valves, as analyzed in the Indian Point ProbabilisticSafety Study (IPPSS), is reduced to approximately 2.9 x 10-7/reactor yearfrom 4.4 x 10-6/reactor year. The latter value is based on IPPSS methodologyusing five year average failure rates to represent the ``no testing'' case,which is consistent with WASH-1400. Since Indian Point Unit 2 has a normallyclosed motor-operated valve in the injection flow path in addition to thetwo series check valves, the probability of an intersystem loss-of-coolantaccident (Event V) via this path, as analysed in the IPPSS, is furtherreduced to approximately 2.6 x 10-9/reactor year. All failure rates quotedabove are mean valves. </ITAG>2.

The proposedamendment only transfers the requirement to perform the particular testfrom the Order Item A.5 to the Technical Specifications. It has previouslybeen demonstrated that by performing the test the margin of safety increases.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The Commission has provided guidance concerning the application ofthe standards for determining whether ``significant hazards considerations''exist by providing certain examples at 48 FR 14870 (April 6, 1983; InterimFinal Rule) and at 51 FR 7744 (March 6, 1986; Final Rule). </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Example (ii) of 51 FR 7744 (Vol. 51, No. 44, Page 7751), which appliesto the addition of the surveillance requirement in the Indian Point Unit2 Technical Specifications, states: </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">``(ii) a change that constitutes an additional limitation, restriction,or control not presently included in the technical specifications, e.g.,a more stringent surveillance requirement.'' </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In addition, example (i) of 51 FR 7744, which applies to the editorialchanges, states: </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">``(i) A purely administrative change to technical specifications:for example, a change to achieve consistency throughout the technical specifications,correction of an error, or a change in nomenclature.'' </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Therefore, since this application for amendment satisfies the criteriaspecified in 10 CFR andSection;50.92, and is similar to examples for whichno significant hazards considerations exist, the licensee has made a determinationthat the application involves no significant hazards considerations. </ITAG>The staff agrees with the licensee's analysis.

This elevation is statedin Item 2.a. of Technical Specification (TS) Tables 3.3-7 and 4.3-4. Therelocation of the monitor was required because of operability concernsassociated with its previous location. A description of the inoperabilityand the plans to relocate the monitor were submitted by Duke Power Companyin a special report dated February 24, 1989. The changes are applicableto Unit 1 only. Unit 2 is included administratively because the TSs arecombined in one document for both units. <T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3>The Commission has provided standards for determining whether a significanthazards consideration exists (10 CFR 50.92(c)). A proposed amendment toan operating license for a facility involves no significant hazards considerationif operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendmentwould not: (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequencesof an accident previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of anew or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated;or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The proposed amendments would not involve a significant increase in theprobability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated becausethe new location of the monitor meets the intent of Regulatory Guide 1.12.The monitor will be operable and capable of performing its intended safetyfunction. The new location would not have any impact on the operation ofstation and would not affect the previously evaluated accidents. The proposed amendments would not create the possibility of a new or differentkind of accident from any accident previously evaluated because the monitorrelocation would not introduce any new modes of operation. Moreover, themonitor would be operable and capable of performing its intended safetyfunction. The proposed amendments would not involve a significant reduction in amargin of safety because the proposed changes would alleviate the operabilityconcern of the monitor. As such, they may enhance the safety margin. Based on the above considerations, the Commission proposes to determinethat the proposed amendments do not involve a significant hazards consideration.<T3>Local Public Document Room location: </T3>York County Library, 138East Black Street, Rock Hill, South Carolina 29730 <T3>Attorney for licensee: </T3>Mr. Albert Carr, Duke Power Company, 422South Church Street, Charlotte, North Carolina 28242 <T3>NRC Project Director: </T3>David B.

The licensee provided a Westinghousereport titled ``Plant Safety Evaluation for Beaver Valley Power StationUnit 1 Fuel Upgrade and Increased Peaking Factors'' to support the requestedchanges. <T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3>The Commission has provided standards for determining whether a significanthazards consideration exists in accordance with 10 CFR 50.92(c). A proposedamendment to an operating license for a facility involves no significanthazard consideration if operation of the facility in accordance with theproposed amendment would not (1) involve a significant increase in theprobability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated, (2) createthe possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accidentpreviously evaluated, or (3) involve a significant reduction in a marginof safety. The licensee stated that the proposed changes have been assessed from acore design and safety analysis standpoint. Extensive reanalyses were undertakento demonstrate compliance with the revised technical specifications. Themethods used to perform the analyses have been previously approved by theNRC. The results, which include transition core effects, show changes inthe consequences of accidents previously evaluated. The results are allwithin NRC acceptance criteria. The major components that determine thestructural integrity of the fuel assembly are the grids. Mechanical testingand analysis of the VANTAGE 5H Zircaloy grid and fuel assembly have domonstratedthat the VANTAGE 5H structural integrity under seismic/LOCA loads willprovide margins comparable to the currently used STD 17 x 17 fuel assemblydesign and will meet all design bases. Therefore, the proposed amendmentdoes not result in an increase in the probabilities or consequences ofa previously evaluated accident. The proposed changes are improvements over, and are comparable to the existingcore design. These changes do not significantly affect the overall methodand manner of plant operation. Thus no new accidents could result fromthese changes. Finally, while new analyses were performed, the acceptance criteria wouldnot be changed from existing criteria. The new analyses show that the upgradedcore design results in no significant change in safety margin. The staff therefore proposes to determine that the requested amendmentinvolves no significant hazards considerations. <T3>Local Public Document Room location: </T3>B. F.

This total response time is defined as thedelay from when the temperature in the reactor coolant loop exceeds thetrip setpoint until the control rods are free to fall into the core. Anevaluation of the results of the initial startup test indicated that the6.0 second time response assumed in the FSAR was not met. The licenseedetermined that the control rods were responding slower than expected.The proposed amendment would increase the above response times by 1.5 secondsto accommodate the slower response. The licensee has evaluated the design-basis accidents affected by thisincrease and concluded that the negative effects on the consequences onthese accidents are minimal and that all safety acceptance criteria continueto be met. <T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3>The Commission has provided standards for determining whether a significanthazards consideration exists in accordance with 10 CFR 50.92(c).

As stated above, since reanalyses of design-basis accidents show that theincreased response times have minimal effects, it follows that the proposedamendment would not involve any increase in the probability or consequencesof previously analyzed accidents. No hardware, software or operational procedures are changed. Hence no newaccidents could be created. Finally, since no previously analyzed accidentsare affected, no safety margins need to be reduced.

The proposedchanges to action requirements would eliminate unnecessary shutdowns byallowing for the performance of engineering evaluations of non-conformingconditions. The proposed changes to surveillance requirements incorporateplant-specific design, installation, and material considerations, and providegreater detail regarding test methods and acceptance criteria. <T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3>The Commission has provided Standards for determining whether a significanthazards consideration exists as stated in 10 CFR 50.92. A proposed amendmentto an operating license for a facility involves no significant hazardsconsideration if operation of the facility in accordance with a proposedamendment would not: (1) involve a significant increase in the probabilityor consequences of an accident previously evaluated; or (2) create thepossibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previouslyevaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.In regard to the proposed amendment, the licensee has determined the following:<ITAG tagnum="21">1. The proposed change does not involve a significant increase inthe probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. Theproposed change revises the action requirements and surveillance requirementsof the Containment Structural Integrity Technical Specifications. The changedoes not involve any physical alteration of the containment or any changeto a setpoint or operating parameter. The change does not add any new equipmentwhich could be the source of a malfunction or accident. Since the changedoes not affect equipment involved in the initiation of previously evaluatedaccidents, the probability of such accidents is not increased. With respectto the consequences of previously evaluated accidents, the change ensuresthat the mitigation capability of the containment is not decreased. Theproposed changes to action statements b and c are as restrictive as thosein the current Technical Specifications in the sense that a condition ofsignificant structural integrity degradation is required to be correctedwithin 72 hours or the unit(s) shut down. For conditions not involvingsignificant degradation, the proposed action statements do not dictateunit shutdown; however, continued structural capability is required tobe verified within 72 hours. The proposed action statements continue torequire an engineering evaluation of deviations from acceptance criteria.The proposed surveillance requirements provide greater detail regardingtest methods and acceptance criteria, and incorporate Vogtle-specific design,installation, and material considerations. Removal of the upper limit onlift-off forces eliminates needless entry into an action statement fora condition not involving abnormal degradation. Revisions to tendon detensioningand retensioning requirements minimize the possibility of damage duringtesting. Performing visual inspections of end anchorages and adjacent surfacesduring tendon surveillance as opposed to during Type A testing will resultin more uniform application of test criteria. Based on the above discussion,the proposed action requirements and surveillance requirements assure thatcontainment structural integrity will be maintained at or above the levelrequired by the current Technical Specifications. The containment will,therefore, continue to be capable of mitigating accidents as discussedin FSAR Chapters 6 and 15. Hence, the consequences of previously evaluatedaccidents are not increased. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. The proposed change does not create the possibility of a new ordifferent kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. Thechange does not add any new equipment to the plant or require any existingequipment to be operated in a different manner from which it was designedto operate. Since a new failure mode is not introduced by the change, anew or different kind of accident could not result. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">3. The proposed change does not involve a significant reduction ina margin of safety. The change does not affect any safety limits or limitingsafety system settings. The change does not involve a reduction of acceptancecriteria where the potential for significant structural integrity degradationexists. The proposed action statements and surveillance requirements assurethat the capability to withstand the maximum containment pressure of 41.9psig in the event of a main steam line break is maintained over the lifeof the facility. Margins of safety are therefore not decreased. </ITAG>The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's determination and concurs withits findings.

Do not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequencesof an accident previously evaluated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">As detailed in NEDC-30851P-A, Supplement 1 the sequence of eventsnecessary for an unmitigated rod withdrawal error includes failure of theLocal Power Range Monitor (LPRM), failure of the Average Power Range Monitor(APRM) upscale trips, failure of the APRM upscale rod block, dual channelfailure of the Rod Block Monitor, and of course operator failure to recognizeand respond to any of these events. The BWR Owner's Group evaluated theimpact of increased STIs on the probability of control rod block failureand concluded that a rather small increase in scram frequency results.However, both the absolute and relative increase is acceptably low andoffset by the benefits of extending the Reactor Protection System (RPS)test intervals [(see NEDC-30851P and the PSEandamp;G to NRC submittal datedFebruary 6, 1989.)] Therefore, it can be concluded that the proposed changesdo not involve a significant increase in the probability of an accidentpreviously evaluated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The consequences of an unmitigated rod withdrawal error were alsoaddressed in NEDC-30851P-A, Supplement 1. Specifically, such an incidentis very mild compared to the limiting reactivity accident - a control roddrop accident. The BWR Owner's Group indicated that the severity of a controlrod drop accident bounds a rod withdrawal error due to the higher rateof reactivity addition. HCGS Updated Final Safety Analysis Report (UFSAR)Section 15.4.9 and Tables 15.4-15 and 15.4-21 provides the plant specificevaluation of the control rod drop accident. As a result of consequencesof a rod withdrawal error were shown to be substantially less than thoseassociated with a dropped rod accident and less than 1% of the specifiedsite boundary dose limits. This low consequence combined with the low probabilityof an unmitigated rod withdrawal error results in a negligible increasein risk which is offset by decreased risks associated with reduced testingof rod block and RPS instrumentation. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. Do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accidentfrom any previously evaluated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The increased Control Rod Block surveillance test intervals do notalter the function of the instrumentation nor involve any type of plantmodification. Additionally, no new modes of plant operation are involvedwith these changes. Therefore, it can be concluded that the proposed changesdo not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident thanany accident previously evaluated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">3. Do not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The NRC staff has reviewed and approved the generic study containedin Licensing Topical Report NEDC-30851P-A, Supplement 1 and has concurredwith the BWR Owner's Group that the proposed changes do not significantlyaffect the reliability or availability of the Control Rod Block instrumentation.Hence it can be concluded that the proposed changes do not adversely affectplant safety margins. </ITAG>The staff reviewed the licensee's determination that the proposed licenseamendment involves no significant hazards consideration and agrees withthe licensee's analysis. Accordingly, the staff proposes to determine thatthe proposed license amendment does not involve a significant hazards consideration.<T3>Local Public Document Room location: </T3>Pennsville Public library,190 S.

Butler <ITAG tagnum="84">Public Service Electric andamp; Gas Company, Docket No. 50-311, SalemGenerating Station, Unit No. 2, Salem County, New Jersey </ITAG><T3>Date of amendment request: </T3>May 5, 1989 <T3>Description of amendment request: </T3>The licensee proposes to reviseSection 4.7.9.e.1 of the Salem Unit 2 Technical Specifications. The changewill delete an aspect of mechanical snubber surveillance test acceptancecriteria which requires a verification that the snubber drag force hasnot increased more than 50% since the previous functional test. This changewas approved for Salem Unit 1 on an emergency basis on May 12, 1989. <T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3>The existence of the 50% drag force increase criterion in the mechanicalsnubber inservice inspection program represents an unnecessary constrainton the verification of snubber operability. A snubber with a drag forcegreatly below the specified limit may experience an increase in drag forcethat is small in absolute terms, but exceeds 50% of the previous test result.This results in an increase in the test population under the present program.The snubber manufacturer (Pacific Scientific) has published a test reportrelated to mechanical snubber drag force loading (Test Report 871, datedApril 13, 1984). The results of these tests indicate that an increase indrag force from one inspection period to the next does not establish atrend that can be used to predict pending snubber failure. The proposedchange does not change the following aspects of the snubber surveillanceprogram: 1. Visual inspections and associated acceptance criteria, which includemanual certification of freedom of movement where possible. 2. Retesting of any snubbers and/or replacements which failed the previoustest. 3. Testing of all snubbers of the same design as a snubber selected forfunctional testing that fails to move or fails to lockup due to a designor manufacturing defect. 4. Verification that the drag force is less than the specified allowablevalue. 5. Verification that activation is achieved within the range of velocityor acceleration specified for both tension and compression. 6. Verification of acceptable release rate or ability to withstand loadwithout displacement, as applicable. 7. Compliance with ASME Section XI per Technical Specification 4.0.5. The measures listed above comprise an adequate program for assuring snubberoperability. Verifying that drag force is within its specified allowablelimit (Item 4 above) is the primary means of determining that the dragforce is acceptable. The requirement being deleted by this proposed changemay cause an unnecessary increase in the snubber test population even ifthe drag force is well below the acceptance criteria. This represents aninappropriate use of resources and an increase in radiation worker exposure.The Commission has provided standards for determining whether a significanthazards consideration exists (10 CFR 50.92(c)). A proposed amendment toan operating license for a facility involves no significant hazards considerationif operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendmentwould not: (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequencesof an accident previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of anew or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated;or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The licensee has analysed the proposed amendment to determine if a significanthazards consideration exists: <ITAG tagnum="21">1)Operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendmentwould not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequencesof an accident previously evaluated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The aspects of the snubber inspection program discussed (in SectionIII) above address the needed snubber functional requirements and shouldtherefore be deemed acceptable for determining snubber operability. Theproposed change does not adversely affect the snubber inspection program.The relevant specified parameters for each snubber subjected to functionaltesting will still be verified to be within allowable limits. Consequently,the proposed change does not increase the likelihood of snubber inoperability,nor does it increase the adverse effects of such inoperability on the associatedsystems. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The snubbers are included in the system design to mitigate the effectsof a seismic event and allow for thermal expansion of the piping. The functionaltesting described above will determine the capability of the snubber tomeet these requirements. The 50% drag force load comparison currently requiredby Technical Specification 4.7.9.e.1 does not supplement the operabilitydetermination of the snubber and can be deleted without adverse impacton the associated system. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Therefore, it may be concluded that the proposed change does not involvea significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accidentpreviously evaluated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2)Operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendmentwould not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accidentfrom any previously evaluated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The proposed change does not involve changes to the design or applicationof snubbers. It does not involve any design or configuration changes tothe plant. No new accident scenarios or new component failure mechanismsare introduced. Therefore, it may be concluded that the proposed changedoes not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accidentfrom any previously evaluated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">3)Operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendmentwould not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Snubbers provide assurance that the structural integrity of the fluidsystems subjected to dynamic loads is maintained. The margin of safetyassociated with snubbers is related to the specified allowable limits imposedon performance parameters, including maximum allowable drag force. Thischange proposes to delete a test acceptance criterion related to a changein the measured drag force, and does not increase the maximum allowablevalue. Therefore, it may be concluded that the proposed change does notinvolve a reduction in a margin of safety as defined by the Technical Specifications.</ITAG>The staff has reviewed the licensee's submittal and significant hazardsanalysis and concurs with the licensee's determination that the proposedamendment does not involve a significant hazards consideration. Therefore,the staff proposes to determine that the proposed amendment involves nosignificant hazards consideration. <T3>Local Public Document Room location: </T3>Salem Free Public library,112 West Broadway, Salem, New Jersey 08079 <T3>Attorney for licensee: </T3>Mark J.

Table3.6-1 contains a list of containment isolation valves with a notation indicatingthe maximum permissible closure time for each valve. The proposed changewould include administrative changes to the table, add 12 previously installedvalves to the table, decrease the maximum closure time for the reactorcoolant pump seal return valve from 71 seconds to less than 60 seconds,and revise the maximum permissible closure time for selected valves. Themaximum closure time for these valves is presently between 3 and 21 secondsand the proposed change would increase the permissible maximum closuretime to 25 seconds. <T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3>The Commission has provided standards for determining whether a significanthazards consideration exists as stated in 10 CFR Part 50.92. A proposedamendment to an operating license for a facility involves no significanthazards considerations if operation of the facility in accordance witha proposed amendment would not: (1) Involve a significant increase in theprobability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated: (2) Createthe possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accidentpreviously evaluated; or (3) Involve a significant reduction in a marginof safety. A discussion of these standards as they relate to the amendment requestfollows: <T3>Standard 1 - Involve a Significant Increase in the Probability or Consequencesof an Accident Previously Evaluated</T3> The proposed amendment would increase the maximum closure time to 25 secondsfor selected containment isolation valves that are not in direct flow pathsfrom the containment atmosphere to the environment. The increase in closuretime to 25 seconds of these selected isolation valves has, by licenseeanalysis, been determined to result in offsite doses that remain within10 CFR Part 100.11 limits. The licensee determined that at a maximum closuretime of 25 seconds, these selected containment isolation valves would notallow a radiation release to the Exclusion Area Boundary (EAB) or Low PopulationZone (LPZ) during the worst accident condition (LOCA) that would exceedthe limits of 10 CFR Part 100.11. This change would not involve an increasein the proba- bility of an accident previously evaluated but does slightlyincrease the radiological releases above the values from the previous analysis.The licensee contends that the radiation releases to the EAB and LPZ underthe worst accident conditions would result in radiation exposures thatare well below the guideline values allowed by 10 CFR Part 100.11. The proposed amendment would decrease the maximum closure time of the reactorcoolant pump seal return valve (SFV-24004) from 71 seconds to less than60 seconds. This is a more restrictive requirement and complies with StandardReview Plan (SRP) 6.2.4, therefore, not increasing the probability or consequencesof an accident. The proposed amendment would add 12 valves to Table 3.6-1. These containmentisolation valves were installed during the 1983 refueling outage and addingthe valves to Table 3.6-1 is purely administrative. Based on the above, the proposed amendment does not, therefore, significantlyincrease the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.<T3>Standard 2 - Create the Possibility of a New or Different Kind of AccidentFrom Any Accident Previously Evaluated</T3> The proposed amendment would not create the possibility of a new or differentkind of accident from what had been previously evaluated. The increaseof maximum closure times of the selected containment isolation valves doesnot introduce a design or operational change that could result in a newor different accident potential that would be worse than the LOCA alreadyconsidered. The proposed amendment would add 12 valves to Table 3.6-1. These containmentisolation valves were installed during the 1983 refueling outage. Addingthe valves to Table 3.6-1 does not change the function of the valves andis considered to be purely administrative. Based on the above, the proposed amendment does not create the possibilityof a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.<T3>Standard 3 - Involve a Significant Reduction in a Margin of Safety</T3>The proposed amendment would not involve a significant reduction in a marginof safety. Although increasing the maximum closure times of the containmentisolation valves from the presently specified range of from 3 to 21 seconds,to 25 seconds, does represent a slight increase in exposure, licensee calculationsconfirm that there remains an adequate margin to the guideline exposuresestablished in 10 CFR Part 100.11. Additionally, the proposed amendmentwould add 12 valves to Table 3.6-1. These containment isolation valveswere installed during the 1983 refueling outage. Adding these valves toTable 3.6-1 does not affect the design bases or function of the valves,and is considered to be purely administrative. Based on the above, theproposed amendment does not involve a significant reduction in a marginof safety. Based on the above reasoning, the Commission proposes to determine thatthe proposed amendment does not involve a significant hazards consideration.<T3>Local Public Document Room location: </T3>Martin Luther King RegionalLibrary, 7430 24th Street Bypass, Sacramento, California 95822. <T3>Attorney for licensee: </T3>David S.

The Commission has determined foreach of these amendments that the application for the amendment complieswith the standards and requirements of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, asamended (the Act), and the Commission's rules and regulations. The Commissionhas made appropriate findings as required by the Act and the Commission'srules and regulations in 10 CFR Chapter I, which are set forth in the licenseamendment. Because of exigent or emergency circumstances associated with the datethe amendment was needed, there was not time for the Commission to publish,for public comment before issuance, its usual 30-day Notice of Considerationof Issuance of Amendment and Proposed No Significant Hazards ConsiderationDetermination and Opportunity for a Hearing. For exigent circumstances,the Commission has either issued a <T4>Federal Register </T4>notice providing opportunity for public commentor has used local media to provide notice to the public in the area surroundinga licensee's facility of the licensee's application and of the Commission'sproposed determination of no significant hazards consideration. The Commissionhas provided a reasonable opportunity for the public to comment, usingits best efforts to make available to the public means of communicationfor the public to respond quickly, and in the case of telephone comments,the comments have been recorded or transcribed as appropriate and the licenseehas been informed of the public comments. In circumstances where failure to act in a timely way would have resulted,for example, in derating or shutdown of a nuclear power plant or in preventionof either resumption of operation or of increase in power output up tothe plant's licensed power level, the Commission may not have had an opportunityto provide for public comment on its no significant hazards determination.In such case, the license amendment has been issued without opportunityfor comment. If there has been some time for public comment but less than30 days, the Commission may provide an opportunity for public comment.If comments have been requested, it is so stated. In either event, theState has been consulted by telephone whenever possible. Under its regulations, the Commission may issue and make an amendment immediatelyeffective, notwithstanding the pendency before it of a request for a hearingfrom any person, in advance of the holding and completion of any requiredhearing, where it has determined that no significant hazards considerationis involved. The Commission has applied the standards of 10 CFR 50.92 and has made afinal determination that the amendment involves no significant hazardsconsideration. The basis for this determination is contained in the documentsrelated to this action. Accordingly, the amendments have been issued andmade effective as indicated. Unless otherwise indicated, the Commission has determined that these amendmentssatisfy the criteria for categorical exclusion in accordance with 10 CFR51.22. Therefore, pursuant to 10 CFR 51.22(b), no environmental impactstatement or environmental assessment need be prepared for these amendments.If the Commission has prepared an environmental assessment under the specialcircumstances provision in 10 CFR 51.12(b) and has made a determinationbased on that assessment, it is so indicated. For further details with respect to the action see (1) the applicationfor amendment, (2) the amendment to Facility Operating License, and (3)the Commission's related letter, Safety Evaluation and/or EnvironmentalAssessment, as indicated. All of these items are available for public inspectionat the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street,NW., Washington, DC, and at the local public document room for the particularfacility involved. A copy of items (2) and (3) may be obtained upon request addressed to theU.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, Attention: Director,Division of Reactor Projects. The Commission is also offering an opportunity for a hearing with respectto the issuance of the amendments. By July 14, 1989, the licensee may filea request for a hearing with respect to issuance of the amendment to thesubject facility operating license and any person whose interest may beaffected by this proceeding and who wishes to participate as a party inthe proceeding must file a written petition for leave to intervene. Requestsfor a hearing and petitions for leave to intervene shall be filed in accordancewith the Commission's ``Rules of Practice for Domestic Licensing Proceedings''in 10 CFR Part 2. If a request for a hearing or petition for leave to interveneis filed by the above date, the Commission or an Atomic Safety and LicensingBoard, designated by the Commission or by the Chairman of the Atomic Safetyand Licensing Board Panel, will rule on the request and/or petition andthe Secretary or the designated Atomic Safety and Licensing Board willissue a notice of hearing or an appropriate order. As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition for leave to intervene shall setforth with particularity the interest of the petitioner in the proceedingand how that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding.The petition should specifically explain the reasons why intervention shouldbe permitted with particular reference to the following factors: (1) thenature of the petitioner's right under the Act to be made a party to theproceeding; (2) the nature and extent of the petitioner's property, financial,or other interest in the proceeding; and (3) the possible effect of anyorder which may be entered in the proceeding on the petitioner's interest.The petition should also identify the specific aspect(s) of the subjectmatter of the proceeding as to which petitioner wishes to intervene. Anyperson who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or who has beenadmitted as a party may amend the petition without requesting leave ofthe Board up to fifteen (15) days prior to the first prehearing conferencescheduled in the proceeding, but such an amended petition must satisfythe specificity requirements described above. Not later than fifteen (15) days prior to the first prehearing conferencescheduled in the proceeding, a petitioner shall file a supplement to thepetition to intervene which must include a list of the contentions whichare sought to be litigated in the matter, and the bases for each contentionset forth with reasonable specificity. Contentions shall be limited tomatters within the scope of the amendment under consideration. A petitionerwho fails to file such a supplement which satisfies these requirementswith respect to at least one contention will not be permitted to participateas a party. Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, subjectto any limitations in the order granting leave to intervene, and have theopportunity to participate fully in the conduct of the hearing, includingthe opportunity to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses. Since the Commission has made a final determination that the amendmentinvolves no significant hazards consideration, if a hearing is requested,it will not stay the effectiveness of the amendment. Any hearing held wouldtake place while the amendment is in effect. A request for a hearing or a petition for leave to intervene must be filedwith the Secretary of the Commission, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,Washington, DC 20555, Attention: Docketing and Service Branch, or may bedelivered to the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building,2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC, by the above date.
