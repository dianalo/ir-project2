Huffington Inc., reflecting the increasing desire of foreign companies to acquire U.S. reserves.    The acquisition fits in with Elf's strategy of &quot;adding little by little&quot; to the company's reserves, said a spokesman for the parent, Elf Aquitaine Group, in Paris.    Neither company would disclose the purchase price, but the spokesman for Elf said the acquisition would increase its U.S. reserves 40%. Given Elf's U.S. year-end reserves of about 24 million barrels of oil, that would put the Huffington acquisition at about 10 million barrels. Based on recent transactions, that would put the purchase price at around $60 million.    There were rumors within Huffington that Elf and Huffington reached an agreement about a month ago that was subsequently called off and that Total Minatome Corp., a unit of another French company, was also interested. Earlier this year, Total bought the oil and gas unit of CSX Corp. for $612 million.    In a recent interview, Gilbert M.A. Portal, president of Elf's U.S. unit, said foreign companies were interested in U.S. reserves for several reasons, including political stability, relatively favorable tax conditions and access to strong markets. Mr. Portal was on vacation in France and couldn't be reached.    Huffington's U.S. operations are fairly small, although the company was &quot;one of the first small-to-midsize independents to go after farm-ins&quot; in the Gulf of Mexico, said John Rogers, treasurer of one of the Huffington companies. Through farm-ins, companies drill on leases owned by other concerns, picking up the costs in exchange for potential future production.    The company's founder and chairman, Roy M. Huffington, a geologist, is one of a dwindling number of independent oil men in Texas. Mr. Rogers said the chairman was traveling out of the country and couldn't be reached.    The crown jewel of Huffington's oil empire is a joint venture in Indonesia, formed in 1969. Discovery of the first major gas field was made in 1972, and a Huffington unit is the operator, with a 20% interest. Other large companies with interests in the venture are Union Texas Petroleum Holdings Inc. and Ultramar PLC. </TEXT></DOC>
