(SDRC) has added an Xwindows interface to its I-Deas solids software for mechanical designautomation.andM;The program has also been enhanced to further automate the process of productdevelopment, officials said.andM;The X interface features pop-up windows, cascading menus, dialogue boxes andicons.andP;  The new interface is consistent with the Open Software Foundation'simplementation of Motif, SDRC officials said.andM;New design technologyandM;SDRC has implemented a new variational design technology to make it easierfor engineers to construct and modify the geometry of their designs.andM;The engineer can make a free-form sketch on screen and the system will&quot;capture the intent of the design engineer and execute the geometry,&quot; saidBrad Morley, SDRC's vice president and general manager.andM;Similarly, when a user changes a dimension, the program changes the geometryautomatically.andM;The program will also automatically analyze an engineer's design.andM;&quot;You can simulate how things work and get guidance from the system to find abetter way&quot; to design any given part, Morley said.andM;The release includes a library of standard features, such as slots andpockets, to which the engineer can make additions.andM;Other features include more complete surface modeling capabilities and theability to generate mesh models and annotated drafting drawings automaticallyfrom a solid model, as well as an extended zoom ability, a symbols library,better IGES support, and faster access to the drawing base, Morley said.andM;In addition, an on-line solver will calculate the kinematic motion of openand closed mechanisms once an engineer defines the joints and motion of anobject.andM;SDRC has also extended the program's testing capabilities by adding newcategories of data acquisition and better ways to group, recall and processtest and time history data.andM;With the advent of the program's new capabilities, the purchase price hasrisen 7 percent, officials said.andP;  Shipments of the new version of I-Deas willbegin in April.andP;  The software is priced from $6,000 to $54,000 per concurrentuser, depending on the number of modules purchased.andM;Users of the present version of I-Deas who have maintenance contracts willreceive the upgrade at no charge.andM;The software runs on DEC's VMS and Ultrix systems, as well as on Apollo,Hewlett-Packard, IBM, Silicon Graphics, Sun Microsystems and Tektronixworkstations.andM;Structural Dynamics Research Corp. is located at 2000 Eastman Drive, Milford,OH 45150-2789, (513) 576-2400.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
