LOUIS  </DATELINE><TEXT>   General Dynamics Corp. said the Greek air force agreed to purchase 40 F-16 fighter aircraft for about $900 million.    The weapons and aircraft maker said the first of the jets is scheduled for delivery in October 1988 and that deliveries will continue for 12 months after that. The F-16 is widely used and General Dynamics said it expects to build 286 of the jets this year.    As part of the agreement, General Dynamics said it and two other U.S. companies -- Fairfield, Conn.-based General Electric Co. and Pittsburgh-based Westinghouse Electric Co. -- will form a Greek concern that will invest $50 million in technology ventures there. General Electric will make the engines for the F-16s and Westinghouse will make the radar.    In composite trading yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange, General Dynamics stock closed at $74.25, up $1.125. </TEXT></DOC>
