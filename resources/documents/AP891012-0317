Mattox said Travelers Insurance Co. and St. Paul Fire and MarineInsurance Co. also agreed to stop certain industry activities in asettlement agreement signed by state District Judge Pete Lowry ofAustin.   In the agreements, both companies denied any wrongdoing orliability. The pacts say each $500,000 payment is for investigativeand legal costs and ``does not represent a fine or penalty.''   ``In essence, these companies have entered a nolo contendere (nocontest) plea and have agreed to testify for the state as thelawsuit continues against the other defendants,'' Mattox said.   The state accuses the insurance industry of seeking to create aphony ``insurance crisis'' several years ago in which insurersclaimed that an increase in lawsuits was forcing them out of thecommercial liability field.   Mattox in March 1988 sued eight major insurance companies andother insurance groups, accusing them of illegally conspiring toboycott, coerce and intimidate insurance consumers in order todrive up rates, cut back coverage and create a false insurancecrisis in the commercial liability field.   Several other states joined a similar suit filed in federalcourt in California.   ``We fully intend to proceed with our legal action against allthese other defendants. As a prosecutor, I can explain it to youlike this: Sometimes you cut a deal with one member of a gang inorder to put the entire gang out of business,'' he said.   ``We are asking the court to set us a trial date as soon aspossible for the rest'' of the defendants, Mattox said.   The state's lawsuit seeks civil penalties and restitution forconsumers.   The civil penalties could range up to $1 million for eachviolation of the state's antitrust law by corporate defendants andup to $100,000 for each violation by individuals.   Spokesmen for both Travelers and St. Paul Fire and Marine saidtheir companies believe they would have won but decided to settlebecause of the costs involved.   ``We look at this as a very cost-effective way for the companyto avoid further legal expense, a lot of inconvenience and a lot ofburden on our shareholders,'' said St. Paul spokeswoman Suzi Hagen.   ``We feel confident that if it would have gone to itsconclusion, there would have been a ruling in our favor. But thecosts of doing this would have far outdistanced the benefits wewould have been getting,'' said Travelers spokesman Dan Kaferle.   Mattox recalled a television advertising campaign in which theinsurance industry contended that the crisis would hindereverything from high school football games to fire protection.   When his suit was filed, Mattox charged the insurance industrywith ``the most insidious consumer fraud perpetrated upon theAmerican public in decades.''   Mattox's investigation began with a letter from the Austinsuburb of Westlake Hills, which was notified in 1985 that itsliability coverage was being canceled.   ``After years with the same liability carriers, Westlake'scoverage was suddenly canceled despite the fact that the city hadonly one minor claim since becoming a city in 1953,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
