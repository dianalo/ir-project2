Police reported three people killed and 10 wounded in shellingduels that raged from late Wednesday night through Thursdayafternoon, further undermining cease-fire efforts by Arab Leagueenvoys.   Thursday's casualties raised the toll to 409 killed and 1,614wounded since fighting erupted March 8.   Christian army commander Gen. Michel Aoun hinted he might usesurface-to-surface missiles against Syria if it keeps the blockadein place, the Mideast Mirror newsletter reported Thursday.   Tension has risen over the reported delivery of Soviet-designedFrog-7 missiles to Aoun's troops by Iraq. The missiles have a rangeof 43 miles, enough to hit the Syrian capital of Damascus if firedfrom the eastern edge of the Christian enclave.   The Christians have never had that capability in Lebanon's14-year-old civil war.   The London-based weekly quoted Aoun saying that ``as far as theblockade is concerned ... there is so much one can take before anexplosion occurs.   ``I'm not for a Frogs war with Syria, but patience has itslimits,'' Aoun was quoted as saying in the telephone interview.   The Syrians, alarmed at the reports of the missiles, last weektightened their naval blockade.   However, police said the tanker that broke the blockade docked atthe port of Byblos, 19 miles north of Beirut, at noon and beganunloading its cargo, triggering a fierce Syrian bombardment.   Christian army gunners retaliated, firing 155mm howitzers atSyrian batteries along the seaside Ein Mreisseh boulevard in Moslemwest Beirut, a police spokesman said on condition of anonymity.   He declined to name the tanker or say how much fuel it carriedfor the 1 million Christians trapped in their 310-square-mileenclave for 16 weeks.   The Syrians have been trying to stop fuel, food and arms fromreaching the Christian forces led by Aoun, who also leads theChristian half of this country's dual government.   It was not clear how the tanker dodged Syrian gunboats patrollingoff the Christian coast. They have turned back several ships tryingto run the blockade this week.   Several others have been sunk by Syrian shellfire.   Three shells hit the campus of the American University of Beirut,which overlooks Ein Mreisseh, during the night. Classes have beensuspended, and there were no casualties.   But customers at Uncle Sam's restaurant across the street wereblown off their chairs.   ``The whole place turned orange with the blast,'' saidphotographic technician Janine Haidar.   Beirut's Moslem sector also was rocked overnight Wednesday bygunbattles between rival Shiite militiamen who traded hit-and-rungrenade assaults on each other's strongholds behind mortar barrages.   No casualties were reported from the fighting that raged in thesouthern slums between the Syrian-backed Amal militia andpro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of God.   The hostilities ebbed into sporadic sniping at daybreak as Syriantroops in charge of west Beirut's security sought to enforce acease-fire, the police spokesman said.   Eighteen people have been killed and 51 wounded in two weeks ofsporadic street battles.   The secular Amal and fundamentalist Hezbollah have been vyingsince April 1988 to control Lebanon's 1.2 million Shiites, thecountry's largest sect. The fighting flared after several months ofrelative calm.   The artillery duels between the Syrian and Christian forcessmothered the festive mood of Moslems marking the first day of Eidal-Adha, or the Feast of Sacrifice, which is Islam's holiest.   Children who were setting off firecrackers fled the streets.Packed candy stores and sidewalk cafes quickly emptied.   The shelling underscored the failure of three Arab League envoys,the foreign ministers of Morocco, Algeria and Saudi Arabia, to endthe war.   The ministers have talked with Syrian President Hafez Assad inDamascus and Iraqi President Saddam Hussein in Baghdad in the lastfew days. All three left Wednesday to spend the feast holidays intheir own countries.   Iraq, Syria's main Arab foe, backs Aoun and has been supplyinghis estimated 20,000 troops, which are outgunned and outnumbered4-to-1 by the Syrians and their Lebanese Moslem allies.   Saddam seeks to thwart Syrian ambitions in Lebanon, which Assadconsiders vital to his country's security, and take revenge forAssad's support of Iran in the eight-year Persian Gulf war.   Aoun has vowed to drive the Syrians out of Lebanon, where theycame in 1976 under an Arab League peacekeeping mandate.</TEXT></DOC>
