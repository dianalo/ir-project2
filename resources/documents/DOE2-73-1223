The next century anticipates a markedly risingenergy demand; to meet which, entirely new energy systems or forms willnot be available, while environmentally acceptable and renewable energiescould only relieve limited extent of the problem. Oil, natural gas, coaland nuclear energy will thus have to be the main energy supply for thetime being. Therefore energy conservation will continue to be necessaryand a matter of urgency. The need to introduce energy-saving technologiesand environment-friendly technologies will in the long run lead to higherenergy prices.</TEXT></DOC>
