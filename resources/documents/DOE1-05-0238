Themodel was originally developed using the modified Bubble Assemblage Model.Physical design specifications of the fluidized bed were found to havelittle influence on the quality of the product gas; in fact the compositionof the gas was found to depend almost exclusively on the degree of approachto equilibrium. Overall thermal efficiency could be improved only byincreasing the dry wood to oxygen ratio and reducing the moisture contentin the wood feed. Because wood gasifiers produce volatiles that greatlyenhance the chance of slugging, the influences of the design and operatingvariables on the occurrence of slugging were also investigated. The onsetof slugging was found to be related most strongly to the dynamic bedheight. 18 refs., 5 figs., 12 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
