One manufacturer the companycontacted turned out to be a maker of concrete garbage cansthat had no interest in golf-teeing machines, says Mr. Weber.   Today, Mr. Weber, who lives in Lakewood, Colo., is stillliving off odd jobs, scraping together $100 a month to payback his family's friends. And he still awaits the royaltiesthat Innovation Center thought so likely to gush. &quot;I wouldn'twish them on my enemies,&quot; he says of the firm.   In written responses to questions from this newspaper,Innovation Center said, &quot;We are confident we have providedevery service timely and professionally&quot; to Mr. Weber. Itsaid Mr. Weber knew the company didn't guarantee success inmarketing his invention and added that Innovation Center hasmany happy customers and is a &quot;well-respected member&quot; of theinvention-marketing industry.   Mr. Weber isn't alone in his complaints aboutinvention-marketing firms. Inventors and others contend someof these firms are bamboozling thousands of inventors out oftens of millions of dollars annually. &quot;These companies aresimply ripping off inventors,&quot; says Tim Pope, an Oklahomastate legislator who helped push through a law to regulateinvention marketers in his state.   The problem is growing because amateur inventing isenjoying an upsurge. Between 1985 and 1990, the number ofpatents granted annually to individuals rose 40%. And, itturns out, aspiring inventors are vulnerable to a sales job,for they usually have no idea how to market their gadgets.   While nobody claims that all invention-marketing firms areunethical, several states have, like Oklahoma, recentlypassed or are considering laws to curtail alleged abuses. Andyesterday, in its biggest crackdown on the industry in morethan a decade, the Federal Trade Commission announced it hadsigned consent decrees with three companies to settle chargesof false claims that it says cost customers hundreds ofthousands of dollars.   The targets were American Idea Management of Stoneham,Mass., which is now largely inactive, and its two successorcompanies, Idea Management andamp; Patent Assistance Corp., ofStoneham, and Technology Licensing Consultants Inc., ofPittsburgh. The FTC charged them with making phony assertionsthat their research reports are &quot;honest, competent andobjective,&quot; that they have special access to manufacturers,and that many clients have made money.   Among other things, the consent decrees obligate thecompanies to make refunds of more than $570,000 and disclosetheir success rates to future customers. &quot;We allege that thesuccess rate of these companies is zero,&quot; says Phoebe Morse,director of the FTC's Boston office.   The companies, in signing the decree, didn't admitwrongdoing. Idea Management said its services will continue&quot;at the same high level of quality.&quot; Technology Licensingsaid the accord &quot;reaffirmed our commitment to the higheststandard of ethics.&quot;   The FTC is also investigating Invention Submission Corp.of Pittsburgh, according to FTC filings in federal court inWashington, D.C., and people familiar with the probe. An FTCspokesman declines to discuss the investigation. InventionSubmission denies any wrongdoing.   An FTC official estimates that tens of thousands ofinventors sign up with marketing companies annually. Some ofthe firms advertise nationally in magazines and newspapers(including this one) and on late-night television. GeraldUdell, a professor at Southwest Missouri State University andowner of the Innovation Institute, which evaluatesinventions, estimates that revenue in the invention-marketingbusiness totals more than $100 million a year.   Company records obtained by law-enforcement officials andthis newspaper show that less than 1% of customers ever get apenny from their inventions, despite fees of up to $10,000that they pay the marketing firms. For example, IdeaManagement says only 18 of its 2,219 clients in the pastseven years licensed their idea to a manufacturer, and only&quot;some&quot; of those have earned a profit.   Some invention-marketing concerns aren't new to criticism.In a 1986 complaint filed in Milwaukee state court, theWisconsin Department of Justice charged Innovation Center(operating under the name American Patent Research) withroutinely telling prospective customers that their ideas were&quot;innovative and marketable&quot; and that the ideas would produce&quot;large financial gains,&quot; when the firm knew that in mostcases that wasn't true.   The company, without admitting wrongdoing, settled thecharges by agreeing not to make such claims in the future andto offer refunds. Innovation Center says it notifies clientsthat invention-marketing is a &quot;risky business&quot; with noguarantee of success. It says it markets only 10% of the&quot;thousands&quot; of ideas it receives each year.   One inventor chosen was Mr. Weber, the golf-tee man. Likemany customers of marketing firms, he was a first-timeinventor. His story is similar to tales told by otherinventors who have dealt with marketing companies. But unlikemost of them, Mr. Weber recorded some of his telephoneconversations with Innovation Center and supplied excerpts ofthose tapes to this newspaper. He says he made the tapes sohe could reflect on the positive things the firm was sayingabout his invention, and so he could share the comments withfamily and friends.   The company's sales representative, Robert Evans, showeredenthusiasm on Mr. Weber after the inventor sent in adescription and crude drawing of the device, essentially aplatform with a hole where the ball pops up. The machine cantee up a couple of dozen balls a minute for use at drivingranges, saving golfers the time of teeing up by hand.   &quot;We can envision this being sold in units of thousands,&quot;said Mr. Evans in one taped conversation. &quot;It is a greatidea.&quot; While Mr. Evans reminded Mr. Weber there were noguarantees of success, he emphasized Innovation Centerbelieved Mr. Weber had a winner. &quot;I was totally elated,&quot;recalls Mr. Weber.   Of course, Mr. Evans added, &quot;it takes money to makemoney.&quot; That meant $790 for a research report, in whichInnovation Center would &quot;thoroughly review&quot; the feasibilityof Mr. Weber's idea. When the inventor said he didn't have$790, Mr. Evans dropped the price to $650. Mr. Weber cashedin his burial-insurance policy and ordered his report.   Running more than 40 pages, the document informed Mr.Weber that golf was a popular sport as evidenced by &quot;the manygolf greens in every community.&quot; It added that an improvingeconomy could mean more money to spend on leisure activitiesand that sufficient national supplies of aluminum andplastics existed to meet the production needs of Mr. Weber'sdevice.   The report didn't mention that people have tried to sellautomatic golf-teeing machines for years. &quot;It just isn't avery saleable item,&quot; says Robert Wittek, owner of Wittek GolfSupply Co., a Chicago maker of equipment for driving ranges.Innovation Center says the fate of earlier teeing devices&quot;does not determine whether Mr. Weber will be successful withhis new product concept.&quot; In fact, the company says, it hasalready &quot;successfully negotiated a license agreement&quot; foranother inventor's golf-teeing device, though it won't givedetails.   After Mr. Weber got the product research report, he paidInnovation Center $7,900 to try to interest a manufacturerand to get any necessary patent protection. If Mr. Webermarketed and patented the invention on his own, it would be a&quot;$50,000 proposition,&quot; Mr. Evans said.   Mr. Evans said his company was carefully selecting up to50 potential buyers for the invention. With that manyprospects, &quot;you are bound to get a good percentage that willrespond in a positive light,&quot; he said. Mr. Weber borrowed themoney from friends of his father.   After he sent it in, Mr. Weber says Innovation Center senthim 40 form letters and product-information fliers to mail tomanufacturing prospects. One responded, says Mr. Weber(Innovation Center says it was three). When Mr. Weber calledthe firm, it turned out to be a maker of concrete garbagecontainers. It apparently got on lists of golfing-equipmentsuppliers because it sold 600-pound trash cans astheft-resistant markers to show golfers where to tee up.   Mismailings by marketers are commonplace, says LeonaGould-McElhone, an investigator for Detroit's ConsumerAffairs Department. She says one company sent a new formulafor peanut brittle to a door company. Clayton Williamson, thepresident of the Kansas Association of Inventors, saysanother firm claimed to have sent an idea for an exercisemachine to 50 manufacturers. But he says 19 of the supposedrecipients couldn't be located at the addresses given, whilethe others turned out to be makers of punch presses andnon-related equipment.   Innovation Center also sent Mr. Weber a set of one-pagepress releases about his invention, which he was to mail togolfing magazines. He says none of the magazines he sentreleases to responded. Mr. Weber also says Innovation Centertold him his idea was being listed in new-product catalogs atinvention trade shows and in computerized data banks, whichcan be perused by manufacturers. No nibbles yet, says Mr.Weber.   The &quot;junk-mail type of approach&quot; that invention-marketingfirms use often repels manufacturers, says RonaldWeingartner, director of inventor relations for the MiltonBradley division of toy maker Hasbro Inc. Whenever he gets ona marketing firm's mailing list, he asks to be removed.Patrick Roosevelt of Detroit says Invention Submission toldhim that it had sent his idea for a novelty baseball hat todozens of companies. This newspaper checked four of thefirms, and all said they routinely junk unsolicitedproposals.   &quot;I turned out to be just another fool on ISC's list,&quot; saysMr. Roosevelt, who paid $4,890. After complaining to thecompany, he says, he plans to accept an offer of a partialrefund. The company declines to comment on Mr. Roosevelt'scase but says that, in general, &quot;individuals who havecomplained have insufficient understanding of the costs ofproviding professional services.&quot;   Some inventors hesitate to complain about service they getfrom marketing firms because they fear breaking theconfidentiality agreements they have signed. But others dosquawk. Mr. Weber is negotiating with Innovation Center for apossible refund, though the company has said that it feels itlived up to its obligations. Craig Scheffler of Port Huron,Mich., says Innovation Center last year returned $4,250 ofhis $7,000 fee after he sent complaint packages to about adozen law-enforcement agencies.   Innovation Center declines to comment specifically on Mr.Scheffler. It says that Mr. Evans, the representative whoworked with Mr. Weber, is now employed by another company,which contracts services from Innovation Center. If Mr. Evanswas estimating royalties for Mr. Weber he was violatingcompany policy, Innovation Center says. Mr. Evans declined tobe interviewed.   Innovation Center also arranged for interviews with threehappy customers. All say the company was instrumental ingetting them licensing agreements with manufacturers, whichhave produced enough revenue to pay back their marketingfees. And they say they are hopeful of earning much more. Oneinvented a quick-draw harness for carrying a hunting rifle,another a pillow with a pocket to relieve pressure on the earwhile sleeping. Both echo Rosemary Deitz, a Sidney, Ohio,inventor of a new kind of butter dispenser, who says thatInnovation Center is &quot;the best company I could possiblyhave.&quot;   About 10 years ago, a law-enforcement push closed someinvention marketing companies and curbed some abuses. Butother firms simply changed their names or locales and kept onselling. Edward Kuhn, a Kansas inventor of a solar-poweredflower planter who fruitlessly spent $5,400 with onemarketer, says he recently heard another outfit advertise onthe radio. &quot;I said to myself, `I hope nobody else getstaken.' But I know somebody will.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
