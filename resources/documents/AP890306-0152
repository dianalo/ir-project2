Newspaper reports have put the death toll from last week's riotsover price increases as high as 600 and the number of injured atseveral thousand. Two Caracas hospitals alone reported treating2,300 people.   Police recovered at least five more bullet-riddled bodies onMonday in one of the slum areas ringing Caracas, and officials saidthe search for more bodies continued.   The riots were the bloodiest in this nation's modern history.   The defense minister, Gen. Italo del Valle Alliegro, said the 8p.m. to 5 a.m. curfew _ Venezuela's first in 25 years _ was liftedin view of the ``normality prevailing all over the country.''   The curfew was imposed Feb. 28, one day after riots and lootingbroke out. The unrest was touched off by steep increases in busfares, gasoline and other basic consumer goods and services _ partof a government austerity plan.   Independent reports said many people were killed by stray bulletsduring battles between security forces and snipers. Heavy fightingwent on until Friday, and sporadic gunfire was heard over theweekend.   The five bodies found Monday were of victims 20 to 25 years oldand were discovered in the San Jose area, scene of fierce fightingThursday and Friday. The neighborhood is a mile north of thegovernment's Miraflores Palace.   Army units were deployed in west and east Caracas to quell anysnipers.   About 15,000 troops joined police in guarding main avenues,supermarkets and government buildings throughout the capital as longlines of people waited to buy food.   Under martial law, soldiers can search houses without warrantsand detain suspects indefinitely without charge.   Student leaders said at least 100 Caracas students were underarrest and 12 were missing.   ``Many were taken from their houses by police and national guardsand the only explanations their parents received was that civilrights had been indefinitely suspended,'' said Jazmin Jaimes, amember of the University Students Federation of Caracas' CentralUnivesity.   Ms. Jaimes said police tortured one student, Vanessa Davis.   ``She was arrested Monday, and witnesses have told us she hasn'teaten anything since,'' she said.   There was no official comment on the claim.   But the defense minister denied on TV the reports of missingpeople, saying the armed forces went onto the streets ``not torepress but to re-establish the order which had been altered.''   Primary and kindergarten schools resumed classes Monday, andsecondary schools were expected to reopen this week.   When universities would reopen was not clear. Universities havetraditionally been centers of protest.   President Carlos Andres Perez ordered the price increases as partof an austerity program arising in part from Venezuela's $33 billionforeign debt.   Venezuela is Latin America's fourth-largest debtor nation behindBrazil, Mexico and Argentina.</TEXT></DOC>
