An increase in overseas rates &quot;could take some of the glitter away from the dollar,&quot; but that's about it, he says.    Players have grown particularly fond of the dollar following reports that the U.S. trade deficit narrowed to a seasonally adjusted $9.89 billion in April, its smallest level in more than three years.    &quot;Trade numbers don't change on a dime,&quot; says Francoise Soares-Kemp, a foreign exchange and Treasury specialist at Credit Suisse in New York. &quot;Personally, I have turned bullish,&quot; she says.    The trade data have been a mixed blessing for the dollar, propelling it to sharply higher levels but also sparking an uptick in interest rates overseas.    Japan raised its one-month and two-month bill discount rates Wednesday by 1/16 point, showing that it is well-prepared to move against an excessively strong dollar as well as concerns about inflation in Japan.    Economic growth there rocketed to an inflation-adjusted annual rate of 11.3% in the first quarter, the highest level in a decade.    In Europe Thursday, Switzerland raised short-term customer time deposits, and Handelsblatt, a German business daily, reported that the Bundesbank central council voted to increase the rate on its securities repurchase agreements to 3.50% from 3.25% Tuesday.    In contrast, U.S. analysts say the Federal Reserve is not likely to raise rates without fresh evidence that the economy is growing at more than a 3% to 3.5% rate or that inflation is picking up substantially.    Following tightening by the Fed three times since early April, the federal funds rate, which banks charge on loans to each other, has steadied at about 7 3/8%, up nearly one percentage point.    Currency market participants have already discounted this week's possible shifts in the global interest rate picture, according to Howard Levine, first vice president of institutional futures at Shearson Lehman Hutton.    The recent firming of rates here has nudged the dollar into the category of high-yield currencies, and this is also undergirding it. Outside of &quot;significant further firming&quot; in overseas rates, the dollar will remain in its upward mode, Mr. Levine says.    Market participants are anxiously looking to the Group of Seven major industrialized nations' economic summit in Toronto, which started yesterday. The G-7 nations are: the U.S., Canada, Britain, France, Germany, Italy, and Japan.    The officials are widely expected to congratulate themselves on the dollar's general stability, a sign their policies are working. But players will be watching closely for clues about the course of rates.    Even if the G-7 were to agree to a &quot;coordinated uptilt in rates,&quot; Mr. Levine says, the U.S. would probably go along, by at least giving the nod to a firmer fed funds rate.    Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said recently that more declines in the dollar would not do much to pare the nation's trade deficit and could actually hamper its improving trend.    Although the presidential election may hit the dollar, some players see it sustaining few injuries and closing the year above its current levels.    Regardless of the election winner, &quot;There is a growing consensus that you're going to see a cut in defense spending and higher taxes,&quot; which will lead to a lower budget deficit, says Arthur Greco, managing director of Rinfret Futures Inc.    He sees the dollar at 1.90 marks by year end. The dollar remains strong against the mark, although the Bundesbank has unloaded an estimated $5 billion in the last month, largely outside of open market intervention.    Meanwhile, Mr. Greco sees the dollar closing the year at 131 yen. The yen refuses to surrender much ground, mainly because of the robust Japanese economy.    ---   Friday's Currency Activity   The dollar finished narrowly mixed in thin trading as many participants headed to the sidelines on the eve of the G-7 meeting.    The U.S. currency moved higher on technical factors in Asian and European trading. The Frankfurt market was closed for a holiday. The dollar fell back early in the U.S. afternoon as the bond market reacted to reports that a U.S. House committee may consider a provision to impose a 5% withholding tax on portfolio interest paid to foreigners. As bonds fell sharply, the dollar eased against the mark but held steady against the yen. The dollar staged a partial recovery and then eased to its closing levels.    Late in the New York day, the dollar was quoted at 1.7495 marks, little changed from Thursday, and at 125.75 yen, up from 125.63 yen. In midmorning trading Monday in Tokyo, the dollar was slightly firmer. It was quoted at about 126 yen, up from 125.84 yen at the opening. The price of gold was quoted at $455.40 an ounce early Monday in Hong Kong.    On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery settled at $454.50 an ounce, up $4.50. Estimated volume was a moderate 3.5 million ounces.    ---                     LATE NEW YORK TRADING                     Friday, June 17, 1988   Based on average of late afternoon buying and selling rates.
