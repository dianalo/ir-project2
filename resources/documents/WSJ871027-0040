The two sides met for about an hour at the White House and agreed on little more than the mechanics for carrying out negotiations and the need to begin moving quickly to signal the plunging stock market that the government is intent on controlling its deficits.    The administration will begin pushing harder this afternoon at a meeting in the Capitol, where it plans to give lawmakers a list of specific spending cuts and revenue-raising measures.    &quot;The president said we need to arrive at an agreement as quickly as possible, so as to remove any doubts on the future of the economy,&quot; said White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater. Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd (D., W.Va.) added: &quot;We need to begin quickly, which we're going to, and work as hard and as fast as we can.&quot;    Administration aides and lawmakers continue to assert that it will be hard to agree on deficit cuts much beyond the $23 billion mandated by the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law for the 1988 fiscal year, which began Oct. 1. But administration officials also acknowledged that the continuing unrest in the markets is raising pressure on negotiators to go further, to show the government's ability to act decisively.    The administration is focusing first on a $23 billion deficit-cutting package but will &quot;go beyond it if we can,&quot; said one official privately. Publicly, Mr. Fitzwater asserted: &quot;We want to achieve as much budget reduction as possible.&quot;    The administration team plans to go to today's meeting with a number of suggested spending cuts as well as a list of proposed revenue-raising measures, officials said. Their proposal is likely to include plans for curtailing certain income-tax breaks that were left untouched by last year's tax-overhaul legislation. Treasury officials worked over the past weekend to prepare a list of options for the team.    There also is increasing interest within the administration in hammering out a deficit-reduction plan that stretches beyond one year. The White House is interested in discussing two-year budgets, particularly in military spending, and other revisions in the budget process that might ensure savings.    The administration also is interested in a spending freeze at fiscal 1987 levels, as well as additional reductions in Medicare and farm-subsidy programs, according to congressional aides.    For their part, Democrats, particularly those in the House, are more interested in using their own pending deficit-reduction bill, which is about half tax increases and half spending reductions, as the launching point for further talks. The House is expected to pass this bill Thursday and send it to the Senate.    Because of the difficulties the negotiators will face in bridging their differences, both congressional and administration aides continued to express skepticism that the negotiators can go beyond $23 billion in deficit reductions. When House Speaker James Wright (D., Texas) mentioned working for a package of more than $23 billion, his comment was greeted by silence, aides said.    Still, negotiators on both sides agree that roughly half the deficit-reduction package should consist of new revenue and half should be spending cuts. They also recognize the need to hold down signs of partisan squabbling, which would only exacerbate market fears that the government can't come to grips with its budget problems. So the administration and Congress agreed yesterday to a &quot;truce&quot; on criticism of each other, and the White House said there would be a news lid on details of the negotiations.    The White House negotiating team, as expected, will consist of Treasury Secretary James Baker, White House Chief of Staff Howard Baker and Budget Director James Miller. The congressional negotiators will include the leaders and ranking minority members of the budget, appropriations and tax-writing committees of the Senate and House.    While no specific plans exist, there already is some discussion in the executive branch of expanding any domestic budget agreement into an international one. If the deficit reductions are big enough, the administration is likely to try to use them as leverage to win new economic concessions from West Germany and Japan, an approach that might produce a three-way package that could have a strong positive impact on financial markets. </TEXT></DOC>
