From $1.5 million in 1988, U.S. shipments of computers andother electronic data-processing equipment jumped to $72.4million in 1990 and are on a pace to reach $90 million thisyear, the department said. The department attributed thetrend to the easing of U.S. controls on various computersthat have become widely available from other sources.</LP><TEXT>   Most 32-bit personal computers are now freed for sale tothe Soviet Union, although the Pentagon still insists oncertain conditions on shipping workstations equipped withso-called reduced instruction set computing, or RISC, chips.   The U.S. still denies shipments of the most advancedcomputers to all countries except those in Western Europe,Japan and other allies.   Assuming continuing economic reforms and some degree ofpolitical stability, the department predicts rising Sovietdemand for other U.S. products. In that country, &quot;there are46 cars for every 1,000 people, compared to 571 cars per1,000 in the U.S.,&quot; Thomas Duesterberg, assistant secretaryof commerce for international economic policy, told theSenate Finance Committee. He also said the Soviets have 130telephones for every 1,000 people, compared with 950 in theU.S. and 700 in Europe.   A U.S.-Soviet trade commission is working to increaseSoviet purchases of U.S. products in the oil and gas,construction, food processing, and medical fields, Mr.Duesterberg said.</TEXT></DOC>
