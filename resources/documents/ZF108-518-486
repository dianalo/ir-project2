Thurston.andM;</AUTHOR><DESCRIPT/><TEXT>SLAPPING SEYMOUR'S WRISTandM;To the Editor:andM;I was surprised to see how hard Jim Seymour came down on Cornell hackerRobert Morris (May 14).andM;Seymour said he was &quot;burned up&quot; because Morris didn't get more cell time.andO;The three years of probation, the 400 hours of community service and the$10,000 fine amounted to just a &quot;slap on the wrist&quot; as far as Big Jim isconcerned.andM;Makes me wonder if Jim has ever been in a prison.andP;  I have only visited one,and I would have to think long and hard before putting someone behind bars.andM;It reminds me of the time when I was a mischievous little boy andaccidentally burned up half an acre playing with matches.andP;  If Jim had beenour county sheriff, I'd still be doing time.andP;  But our kind-hearted sheriff&quot;sent exactly the wrong signal&quot; to other would-be pyromaniacs by letting mego with just a stern warning.andM;Jim's column was so full of fire and brimstone I was expecting to see himcall for the death penalty.andP;  Maybe he's right.andP;  People like Morris can causea lot of trouble.andP;  Perhaps we should rally around Jim and help him sponsorlegislation to permit summary executions for breeding viruses.andP;  After all,public beheadings have an enormous deterrent effect.andM;Good work, Jim.andP;  It gives me a warm feeling to have you protecting theright-wing fringes of computer science.andM;Ed MitchellandM;Senior Software EngineerandM;HunterLabandM;Reston, Va.andM;CONSTRUCTIVE REHABandM;To the Editor:andM;The May 14th column by Jim Seymour lambasting our justice system for nothanging a hacker was too much to stomach.andP;  It amazed me to read that he felta $10,000 fine and three months of full-time community service was &quot;trivial.&quot;andO;Then he followed it up with &quot;the judge now shares the blame&quot; because thesentence was merely slapping Morris' wrist.andM;It's not fair to view a &quot;hack&quot; of this nature as a wanton criminal act.andO;Sure, malicious acts deserve to be treated as such, but make the punishmentfit the crime.andP;  How about a three-month sentence at the FBI helping them withtheir artificial-intelligence programs that analyze criminal minds, or atCIA/NSA helping them develop even more sophisticated ways of analyzingunfriendly data?andP;  The kid would be so enthralled by their awesome equipmenthe'd end up staying another 20 years.andM;It's time the stuffed shirts like Seymour realized that computers are likegiant toys and you're supposed to play with them.andP;  It helps you build betterones.andP;  So what if 6,000 people came &quot;grinding to a halt&quot; on a network.andP;  Theyprobably needed a day off.andM;David SmithandM;WashingtonandM;ALIVE AND KICKINGandM;To the Editor:andM;I take exception to Rob Garretson's May 7th editorial, &quot;The Ghost of PCjr HasTaught IBM a Lesson.&quot;andM;The PCjr is not dead.andP;  IBM did cease production in April 1985, but kept theirJunior Hot Line active until February of last year and still promise thatspare parts will be available from them for five more years.andM;I'm the editor of the Phoenix, a PCjr newsletter published in New York, andreceive numerous copies of similar publications from around the country.andP;  Ahost of third-party firms are still active selling and, yes, manufacturingJunior hardware.andM;You would be hard-pressed to find an original 64K single-drive unit with the&quot;click it&quot; keyboard, but most of the half-million made survive.andM;R.andP;  Thurston ClarkandM;Senior Systems AnalystandM;Columbia UniversityandM;New York</TEXT></DOC>
