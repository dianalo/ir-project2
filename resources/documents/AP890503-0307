The barriers include quantitative restrictions, exportsubsidies, customs barriers, public procurement policies,countervailing duties, anti-dumping procedures and tax policies,the EEC report said.   Its release came five days after the U.S. administrationreleased its report on foreign trade practices it considers unfair.   EEC Commission spokesman Claus Ehlermann said the timing of therelease of the EEC report was not linked to the U.S. report. Hesaid the EEC report was an annual event and its release simply``coincided'' with the report by the Office of the U.S. SpecialTrade Representative.   The EEC report criticized the 1988 U.S. Fair Trade Practices Actwhich, it said, will ``make it more likely that unilateral actionwill be taken to redress allegedly unfair trade practices,''   ``Such unilateral action...without authorization from theGeneral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade is illegal.''   The report also cited the ``Buy American'' provision of the U.S.Trade Act that ``has created permanent discrimination in favor ofU.S. products.''   The clause provides for action by the U.S. Administrationagainst foreign countries which discriminate against U.S. productsor services in government procurement, including a ban against``offending'' countries.   Another category of restrictions includes U.S. measures whichhave been found to violate international trading rules, and inwhich the United States has neither modified nor offeredcompensation to its trade partners for trade damage caused.   As examples the report cites the ``U.S. failure'' to implementfindings of the GATT on the illegality of the ``Superfund'' oillevy and the ``non-conformity'' of the U.S. system of customsusers' fees.</TEXT></DOC>
