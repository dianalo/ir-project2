 It makes sense.andP;  More users needto manipulate and store extremely large files, with the result that harddisks boasting 150-Mbyte capacities are becoming more prevalent.andM;But if those files comprise scanned images, 3-D graphics and sound, each ofwhich can eat up multiple megabytes of hard disk space, even a 150-Mbyte harddisk can become cramped.andM;That's why optical storage has entered the picture.andP;  WORM(write-once-read-many) drives are addressing the needs of Macintosh ownerswho need to archive vast amounts of data.andP;  The media vary in capacity fromabout 600 Mbytes for the MW-5D1 WORM from Mitsubishi Electronics to 732Mbytes offered by Storage Dimensions' LaserStor to up to 3.2 Gbytes providedby the WDD-3000 Drive from Sony Corp. of America.andM;Scads of data.andP;  One way to look at WORM storage is to compare it withmicrofiche, once the only way to permanently store large amounts of data in asmall space.andP;  In fact, many microfiche users who want to avoid the hassle ofaccessing microfiche sheets through a reader have turned to WORM drives.andP;  Anexample is the accounting firm of Arthur Young in New York.andM;The company uses a Sony WORM drive-based system developed by value-addedreseller Micro Dynamics Ltd. of Silver Spring, Md., to support its legaldepartment of 20 trial attorneys.andP;  During the pre-trial discovery period, thedepartment receives mounds of documents from opposing attorneys.andP;  Beforepurchasing Micro Dynamics' MARS (multi-user archival and retrieval system),the firm had to photograph the documents onto microfiche, then haveparalegals type an index to the microfiche onto a Data General computer.andO;When attorneys needed a document, they would either use the Data Generalindex to find the document's number or have a paralegal do the search.andM;Once the document numbers were determined, a clerk would pull the microfichedocuments, enlarge and deliver them.andM;According to Paul Gussenhoven, system manager at the company, the process wastime-consuming, expensive and inefficient.andM;&quot;Attorneys didn't always receive the document they thought they were going toget, and the whole system required a lot of running around and a good deal ofwasted time,&quot;  Gussenhoven said.andM;Using MARS, attorneys now can access the index from a local or remote Macrather than have to use the Data General index.andP;  More important, they can usetheir Macs to access the actual documents, which are all scanned in and savedon Sony discs.andP;  &quot;Giving the attorneys direct access to the documentsthemselves as well as to the index probably decreased our turnaround time fordocument retrieval by 70 percent,&quot; he said.andM;Cue up the jukebox.andP;  Since all the data must be available to the Mac at alltimes, Arthur Young has turned to Sony's jukebox, a system made up of WORMplatters that are selected by the computer and physically moved into placemuch like a musical jukebox.andP;  The Sony jukebox, which is sold only throughvalue-added dealers, hold 50 platters of 3.2 Gbytes each.andP;  Although scannedimages take up a lot of space, Gussenhoven said he doen'st expect to fill uphis 160 Gbytes of storage in the foreseeable future.andM;Appearances can be deceiving.andP;  The inability to erase WORM discs is not aproblem for Gussenhoven.andP;  He rarely has to modify the index, and when hedoes, he makes use of software created by Micro Dynamics that gives theappearances of altering data.andP;  In reality, the old versions of the fileremain on the disc.andM;A number of VARs provide software that make WORM discs appear to be erasable.andO;A few vendors, such as Corel Systems Corp., sell such packages separately.andO;But even with this software, there are always pointers that allow the user tosee previous versions of the data.andM;This has encouraged many state legislatures and the Internal Revenue Serviceto declare that WORM diss legally can be used for document storage, just asmicrofiche is, as long as strict auditing procedures are maintained.andM;But the final decision stsill rests with the courts.andP;  One IRS memo concluded,&quot;Our opinion $(that WORM drives can be used in the same way that microfichecan$) is as certain as it can be given the possibility that an individualjudge may in a particular case find that an original return is required.&quot;andM;Captive audience.andP;  The biggest problem with WORM drives is mediaincompatibility.andP;  At present, virtually every WORM manufacturer's equipmentrequires its own platter.andP;  As a result, you can't read data created on onedrive using a competing drive.andM;This can create some serious inconveniences.andP;  For example, you can't senddata by mailing a disc to another company using a different type of drive.andO;And once you have written to a number of discs you're basically a captive ofthat one vendor, since a second drive from another vendor won't read yourlibrary.andM;Even so, WORM discs can be ideal for those who require large, permanentstorage.andP;  The media are conservatively estimated to last 10 years from thetime they are written to, and some tests point to a shelf life of up to 30years.andM;Moreover, they require much less environmental control than do magneticmedia.andP;  They can be stored almost anywhere and will probably maintain theirdata even if the cooling and heating systems are turned off on weekends.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
