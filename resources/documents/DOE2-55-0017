<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-55-0017 </DOCNO><TEXT>A laboratory-scale apparatus was developed for the direct measurementof the heat of gasification for solid fuels. The apparatus was designedto simulate radiant energy transfer rates found under actual fire conditionsand designed in such a way that the energy gains and losses with respectto the sample surfaces are well defined. Calculation of the time dependentheat of gasification for solid fuels relies on the ability to measureaccurately and continuously the time dependent energy transfer ratesand material responses. Tests were conducted in which samples of polymethylmethacrylatewere subjected to incident heat fluxes ranging from 1 to 4 W/sq cm. Testresults indicate that, under these conditions, the heat of gasificationis significantly influenced by the time-dependent thermal propertiesof the material and approaches an asymptotic value that varies with incidentheat flux. The asymptotic values decrease with increasing incident heatflux and approach a value of 1600 J/g consistent with values publishedby other investigators. Refinement of the apparatus and the testing ofother materials is continuing. Results for two additional materials,fir and oak are included as Appendix A.</TEXT></DOC>
