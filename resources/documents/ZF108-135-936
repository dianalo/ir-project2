Malia, director of the Office of Information Resources ManagementPolicy, said the office automation environment will consist of a series oflocal area networks linked to the department's Executive Computer Network(ECN).andM;Labor's Directorate of IRM began installing ECN in 1987 for the secretary,deputy and assistant secretaries, and their staffs.andP;  The executive networkhas expanded to serve agency administrative officers and regionaladministrators with electronic mail, word processing and spreadsheetexchange.andM;&quot;Standard office automation was what we were trying to put in place,&quot; Maliasaid.andP;  &quot;By extending ECN into the administrative area, we allow all the basic[operations] of the department to go over this office automation network.andM;&quot;We end up with a tree structure, with the secretary and assistantsecretaries at the top.andP;  Then each agency has a LAN underneath that ties tothe ECN.&quot;andM;ECN now connects about 150 IBM-compatible 80286-based micros on a fiber-opticEthernet backbone.andP;  The department awarded a contract in 1987 to Syscon Corp.andO;of Washington, for the LAN installation.andP;  Network Solutions Inc. of Vienna,Va., and Computer Data Systems Inc. of Rockville, Md., furnish networksupport.andM;Although agencies can order equipment and support for their own operationsthrough the departmental contracts, many do not.andP;  The Labor IRM office givesagencies freedom to find their own technical solutions so long as they adhereto the basic architecture.andM;Under FTS 2000, more than 400 department sites throughout the country willget some type of dial-up access.andM;&quot;Because of the nature of what we do, the department has many small fieldstations with one or two people,&quot; Malia said.andP;  &quot;Any number of communitiesneed assistance from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration andthe Employment Training Administration.&quot;andM;But Malia said this decentralization will not hinder the move to FTS 2000,because most Labor agencies already have government-owned protocol converterstied into lines leased from Tymnet, McDonnell Douglas Network Systems Co. ofSan Jose, Calif.andM;&quot;Interestingly, our telecommunications environment is closer to beingstandardized than anything else,&quot; she said.andP;  &quot;So the FTS 2000 move will notbe as much of a change as if we had every agency in a separate environment.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
