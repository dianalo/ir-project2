(graph)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Diversity at the Low EndandM;In Europe, diversity dominates and divides the varous countries and cultures.andO;That same diversity is also discernible at the low end of the informationsystems spectrum, where there exists a wide range of market conditions andapplication needs.andP;  However, cutting through this diversity are commonattitudes toward technology and its associated risks and rewards.andM;Overall, the European market for PCs and workstations is reasonably buoyant,with user interest picking up in both the private and public sectors.andP;  Yet,despite some nationalistic tendencies toward homegrown wares--particularly inFrance and West Germany--most of the PC and workstations being purchased inEurope today are of foreign vintage.andM;To fully understand the market, you must understand the mentality at work inEurope.andP;  While Europe is made up of discrete countries at various stages ofIS implementation, these countries share many of the same attitudes regardingPCs and workstations.andM;Right now, most European users are saddled with DOS systems, and the softwareproblems associated with these PCs are beginning to surface.andP;  At the sametime, users are currently reluctant to bring in new machines, choosinginstead to maximize their current investments.andP;  Aware of these problems,European users are demanding more from their current PC products.andM;This conservative trend, which is much more prevalent in Europe than in theUnited States, should slow the pace of European PC purchasing.andP;  Thisnaturally runs counter to optimistic predictions that the European PC marketwill continue to grow at a healthy clip well beyond 1993, when many ofEurope's economic borders will come down.andM;What will burgeon is the number of PCs connected to local area networks,however.andP;  Consequently, the revenue from LANs should actually grow more thanthe revenue from PCs.andP;  The demand for high-end network servers in Europeshould also increase as more PC users connect their machines directly toLANs.andM;Multiuser Systems Turning to UnixandM;The most significant expansion in the PC market is expected to come frommultiuser machines targeted at the lower end of various vendors' minicomputerlines.andP;  Multiuser systems based on PCs will inevitably turn to UNIX.andP;  Whatthat means for the future of office workstations is still not certain, sincethe battle will be raging for some time to come over whether UNIX or IBM'sOS/2 operating system will dominate desktops in Europe and the United States.andO;Nevertheless, it is reasonable to speculate that OS/2 will be the choice ofEuropean companies in the private sector, which persist in clinging toproprietary products.andM;But the move to OS/2 promises to be a slow march because the operating systemis still immature and the cost of the hardware remains prohibitive.andP;  As aresult, OS/2 is not expected to become a major force in the European officeworkstation market before 1992.andM;In the public sector, meanwhile, UNIX will be favored.andP;  Influenced bypolitical decisions and supported by the national Post, Telephone andamp; Telegraph(PTT) authorities, European governments are making strong commitments to bothUNIX and the International Standards Organization's Open SystemsInterconnection (OSI) model.andP;  And, indeed, many public organizations inEurope are already specifying UNIX as the mandatory operating system.andM;With the big push by the European public sector for standards, UNIX and OSIpromise to spark sales of multiuser PCs and possibly even officeworkstations.andP;  Still, the bulk of the office workstation business in Europewill come from private sector firms because the cost per user--runningroughly at $7,000 for a 7-megabyte PS/2 model 70--is far too high for publicsector organizations.andP;  As a result of these cost considerations, PC/DOSmachines, warts and all, will continue to remain strongly present in thepublic sector for the foreseeable future.andP;  And both sectors are contributingto the growth of PC/DOS-based LANs.andM;Similarly, with the exception of a few application areas such as geophysicalresearch, European governments have not been heavy users of engineeringworkstations.andP;  The dominant users of engineering workstations in Europe havebeen in the private sector, where shipments have soared over the past fewyears.andM;Vendors With AppetitesandM;In 1988, shipments of engineering workstations in Europe skyrocketed 82% to66,000 units, according to International Data Corp. of Framingham, Mass.andP;  Thecurrent installed base in Western Europe of 2,148,000 engineeringworkstations is expected to continue to expand before leveling off in 1994.andO;The real growth in the market promises to come from reduced instruction setcomputing (RISC) machines--growth that could hold big payoffs for the currentmarket leaders, IBM and Silicon Graphics Computer Systems Inc.andM;There are no noteworthy European engineering workstations.andP;  As in the rest ofthe world, U.S.andP;  vendors Apollo Computer Inc., Digital Equipment Corp.,andO;Hewlett-Packard Co. and Sun Microsystems Inc. share stakes in the engineeringworkstation market in Europe.andP;  HP, however, is still the biggest shareholderin that market, which will continue to be dominated by U.S.andP;  suppliers.andM;European vendors, hungry for a slice of this juicy segment, are expected tolink up with other foreign suppliers, marketing the resulting workstationwares under their own labels.andP;  Many of these deals will be with smallercompanies that produce less popular RIS machines.andP;  Such collaborations couldwind up giving front-runners IBM and Silicon Graphics a real run for theirmoney in Europe.andM;This link-and-label approach is all too familiar to European vendors, most ofwhich have dropped the ball at the low end and filled in their PC product gapwith machines manufactured in the Far East and sold under their ownproprietary names.andP;  Most are IBM-compatible machines that are chiefly soldthrough dealer networks.andM;Martin Healey is chairman of the board of Technology Concepts Ltd. inCwmbran, South Wales.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
