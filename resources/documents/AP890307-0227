JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Supreme Court's refusal to intervene in anacid rain dispute between the Northeast and the industrial Midwestleaves the problem of interstate air pollution up to President Bushand Congress.   For nearly a decade, a group of northeastern states has waged alegal campaign to try to get the Environmental Protection Agency tocrack down on industrial polluters as far away as Illinois, claimingpollution from those states is ruining their lakes and forests.   On Monday, the Supreme Court decided against considering thecase. It let stand a federal appeals court decision agreeing withthe EPA that the states had not shown that their pollution problemsstemmed from emissions hundreds of miles away.   But some environmentalists and EPA officials suggested Mondaythat the legal fight may no longer have the importance it once had,anyway. Congress is expected this year to enact new federallegislation specifically addressing acid rain pollution.Environmentalists hope the legislation will curb emissions of sulfurdioxides and nitrogen oxide from coal-burning power plants andfactories.   These pollutants often travel hundreds of miles and fall to theground as highly acidic rain destroying freshwater life and forestvegetation in areas where the air otherwise is considered largelyfree of pollution. The New England states have been among thosecomplaining about acid rain caused by the industrial Midwest.   In the early 1980s, petitions to the EPA by Maine, New York andPennsylvania claimed that soot, smoke and sulfur dioxide wereblowing from the industrial Midwest and making it impossible forthem to meet federally required air pollution requirements.   They cited pollutants from coal-burning utility plants andfactories in Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan, Ohio, Tennesseeand West Virginia.   But the EPA argued that the complaining states were responsiblefor maintaining their own air quality and that they had not producedsufficient evidence that the pollution stemmed from smokestakes inthe states cited. The EPA also argued that federal law is notspecifically designed to cover such long-range pollution.   Last July a federal appeals court agreed and, deferring to theagency's expertise, said the EPA's position was reasonable.   Although New York did not pursue the matter to the Supreme Court,Maine and Pennsylvania were joined in the petition before the highcourt by Vermont, New Hampshire, New Jersey and Connecticut.   The case has never specifically cited acid rain because there isno federal acid rain legislation. Instead it has focused on theamount of certain pollutants that were found in the air.   According to a national acid rain assessment program, theindustrial belt stretching from West Virginia to Illinois accountsfor high emissions of sulfur dioxides and nitrogen oxide.   Federal clean air legislation enacted in 1970 directed thatindustrial and utility smokestakes be heightened, a requirementwhich improved air quality near such plants, but sent the emissionshigher into the air where they traveled farther.   Scientists believe that about two-thirds of the sulfur dioxideemissions in the United States come from coal-burning electric powerplants and another 11 percent from industrial fuel combustion.Nearly half of all nitrogen oxides are believe to come from electricpower plant and industrial fuel combustion, while nearly 38 percentcomes from transportation.</TEXT></DOC>
