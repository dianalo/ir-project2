Minister for European Affairs Edith Cresson said Europeansshould work together to defend French as well as Italian, Germanand other languages ``because language is also culture and we mustbe able to talk to each other.''   Interviewed on RTL radio, the minister said plans to eliminatethe borders among the 12 European Economic Community countriesshould not apply to language.   ``There should not be a single language in Europe, because itwould inevitably be English,'' she said.   ``Children in the Netherlands or Denmark all speak a foreignlanguage and sometimes two,'' she said. ``There is no reason whyour children, if we start them young learning languages in anattractive and lively way, could not do it.''</TEXT></DOC>
