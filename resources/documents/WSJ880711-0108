The child gets a place to live at school, the parents get a real-estate investment that presumably can be sold at a profit when the child graduates.    Now financial planners and accountants are recommending a wrinkle on the same idea -- the minidorm. To use this tactic, says James Avedisian, a tax partner with accountants Coopers andamp; Lybrand, &quot;buy a house on campus for several kids to share and hire your own child as live-in rental manager.&quot;    The minidorm has one large advantage over the kiddie condo: The child is paid a salary for finding tenants, collecting rents and the like, and uses the money to pay college expenses. But on the parents' tax return, says Mr. Avedisian, the salary is considered an expense and can be used to offset the minidorm's taxable rental income. Thus, the strategy transforms nondeductible college expenses into deductible business expenses.    Furthermore, income taxes for individuals don't kick in until earnings top $3,000. So, as long as the child's salary doesn't exceed that amount, it won't be taxed. And even if it does, it usually will be taxed only at the lowest rate of 15%.    Minidorms make especially good sense for parents with adjusted gross incomes of less than $100,000, according to Sidney Kess, a tax partner at accounting firm Peat Marwick Main andamp; Co. That's because the Internal Revenue Service allows these people to use up to $25,000 in losses on the minidorm to offset salary or other taxable income.    For parents earning more than $100,000, however, the deductible amount is gradually reduced until it disappears completely at the $150,000-in-earnings mark. Still, there is a way to keep losses in the family: Put the house in the name of a grandparent making less than $100,000, suggests Mr. Kess.    Despite the minidorm's attractions, there are risks, especially since the property's manager is a youth. &quot;He might bring in friends to share the house who don't pay rent,&quot; says Mr. Avedisian. &quot;If they don't pay rent, it's going to be a losing proposition for Mom and Dad.&quot; What's more, he says, &quot;if the kids trash the place, the property's value could decline.&quot;    Given those potential problems, some parents may prefer a similar, but simpler strategy. This one will only work for those with a family-owned business and calls for the parents to hire the college-age child as an employee of that business. There won't be any rental-property losses to deduct, and the child won't have a free place to live. But, as with the minidorms, the child's salary can be written off as a business expense. And, once again, the child won't pay taxes on the salary as long as it doesn't exceed $3,000.    But be careful. Simply paying a child to clean the family pool and then calling the payments salary is not something smiled upon by the IRS. &quot;The money has to be earned in connection with a trade or business,&quot; says Mr. Avedisian.    A child who can only work in the family business during the summer might be retained as a &quot;consultant&quot; the rest of the year, accountants say. &quot;Kids who've grown up in a family business, especially retail businesses, often have some good thoughts about what kind of inventory to stock (and) what sells,&quot; Mr. Avedisian notes. </TEXT></DOC>
