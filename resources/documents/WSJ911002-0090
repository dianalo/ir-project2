But behind thepublic statements of approval lies a very real Soviet worrythat the proposals might be a trap to ensure American nucleardomination in the future.   As a result, the Soviets are taking pains not to committhemselves to following the U.S. lead until they are certainthey won't be left as the losers. Instead, they are hastilydispatching top-level officials to Washington to seek&quot;clarification,&quot; and working on their own counterproposals.</LP><TEXT>   At the same time, Moscow is eager not to be seen asdragging its heels on nuclear disarmament -- particularly nowthat it is seeking huge financial aid from the West.Officials here have been stressing that it has been theSoviet Union during the Gorbachev era that played a key rolein starting the process of arms reductions leading to Mr.Bush's landmark speech.   President Mikhail Gorbachev hinted at this dilemmayesterday after he met with Austrian Chancellor FranzVranitzky. &quot;Without a doubt, the U.S.S.R. president supportsPresident George Bush's initiative,&quot; he told reporters. But,&quot;in such questions, rushing on the side of the Soviets andtheir president could lead to poorly thought-out steps in thearea of disarmament.&quot;   Soviet officials say they have little quarrel with one ofMr. Bush's most sweeping unilateral proposals: theelimination of ground-launched tactical nuclear weapons.These short-range missiles have become almost meaninglesswith the collapse of the Warsaw Pact and the unification ofGermany. Indeed, as the U.S.S.R. breaks up, the tacticalmissiles scattered throughout the republics could prove to bea dangerous liability if they fall into the hands ofnationalist extremists.   The Soviets have already moved to match one of Mr. Bush'sother unilateral measures. Yesterday, Mr. Gorbachev'sspokesman, Andrei Grachev, said the U.S.S.R. would removefrom alert status ballistic missiles covered under therecently signed Strategic Arms Reduction treaty, or Start.   More troubling to the Soviets, however, are the U.S.proposals on reducing land-based intercontinental nuclearmissiles, particularly those with more than one warhead. Mr.Bush proposed an early agreement with Moscow to eliminatesuch weapons, which he described as &quot;the most vulnerable andunstable part of the U.S. and Soviet nuclear forces.&quot;   Because of the different composition of their nucleararsenals, these missiles make up the core strength of theSoviet nuclear forces. The Start agreement, signed byPresidents Bush and Gorbachev in July, will eliminate some ofthe Soviets' most deadly type of land-based missile withmultiple warheads, the SS-18.   But notably absent from Mr. Bush's initiative was aproposal to eliminate the U.S. arsenal of multiple-warheadmissiles based on submarines. Soviet officials complain thatthose U.S. sea-based missiles represent a threat thatcorresponds to their land-based ones. So far, the U.S. hasbalked at limiting this type of weapon.   Soviet strategists also appear concerned by Mr. Bush'sinsistence on continuing with the Strategic DefenseInitiative, the so-called Star Wars space-based missiledefense system first proposed by President Reagan. Moscow hastoned down its objections to SDI over the past two years,partly because it believed the U.S. Congress wouldn't providethe funding. But officials here still have strong misgivingsabout the program.   After Mr. Bush's speech, Soviet officials aren't willingto discuss such doubts in public. But privately, the tone isfar less enthusiastic of the U.S. initiatives than Moscow'sofficial statements.   &quot;Is it a trap?&quot; asked a senior official. &quot;It certainlycould be, and that's why we are being wary. We don't want thenext round of disarmament to be completely lopsided.&quot;   Such worries were echoed by Col.-Gen. Bronislav Omelichev,the deputy chief of staff, who told Tass Monday that thequestion of intercontinental ballistic missiles should beconsidered &quot;within the framework of talks on strategicstability.&quot; This issue, he stressed, &quot;will require thoroughstudy.&quot;   To mask their concerns and regain the public-relationsinitiative, Soviet officials are now saying they will producetheir own counterproposals to the Bush plans. Mr. Gorbachevhimself has given instructions to Soviet planners to producesuch proposals within one week, according to Mr. Grachev, thepresident's spokesman.   Among other things, the Soviet counterproposals are likelyto reiterate an old demand for a ban on nuclear testing,something to which the U.S. has never agreed. The issue hasassumed enormous political importance in the U.S.S.R. becausethe leaders of both Kazakhstan and Russia, the two maintesting sites, are balking at further tests in theirrepublics.   The State Department did announce yesterday that U.S.nuclear weapons specialists, who will depart for Moscow in afew days for talks on Mr. Bush's disarmament proposals, wouldbe willing to discuss the longstanding Soviet proposal for atest ban. &quot;We would be in a position obviously of listeningto whatever they come back with,&quot; department spokeswomanMargaret Tutwiler said. In any event, she added, &quot;the amountof {underground} nuclear testing we have been doing has beengoing down,&quot; and implementing Mr. Bush's plan would result ineven fewer test explosions.   Moreover, the U.S.S.R. is apparently hoping to broaden thedisarmament talks to include the strategic arsenals of othernuclear powers, especially Britain and France, and othercategories of weapons, such as chemical and biological ones.Vladimir Petrovsky, a deputy foreign minister, told reportersMonday that the Soviet counterproposals would include&quot;unilateral, bilateral and multilateral&quot; steps. AlthoughBritain and France may follow the U.S. lead on cuttingtactical nuclear forces, both insist they will continue theirlonger-range strategic missile programs.   Meanwhile, the Bush administration has said the continuingtalks between Moscow and Washington could result in afour-nation meeting of foreign ministers in November or evena summit with Messrs. Bush and Gorbachev, French PresidentFrancois Mitterrand and British Prime Minister John Majorattending.   Whatever the Soviet misgivings over details, Moscow isclearly eager to avert the risk of nuclear proliferationamong the increasingly assertive republics and to find waysto reduce military spending, estimated at a quarter of grossnational product. Deputy Defense Minister Pavel Grachev gavean early indication yesterday that Moscow is considering bigcuts in conventional forces, telling a parliamentarycommittee that the size of the Red Army could be halved toabout two million men. Independent analysts have alreadysuggested that such a drastic cutback would be in order.</TEXT></DOC>
