A civil complaint filed at federal court in the District ofColumbia accused the Shreveport, La.-based concern and itspresident and chairman, Wesley Godfrey Jr., of failing to disclose,among other things, that the company's primary asset, SecurityNational Bank, had been declared insolvent.   The SEC complaint alleged that an independent auditor's reportprepared for inclusion in the company's 1988 annual report to theSEC was substantially altered and some parts were omitted entirely.   ``Basically, it was a cut-and-paste job on the auditors' opinionon the annual report,'' said Bruce Hiler, an SEC attorney inWashington.   There was no answer at Security National Bancorp on Tuesdayevening and it could not otherwise be reached for comment.   The SEC complaint further alleged that the company's 1988 filingfailed to disclose that the independent auditors had resigned threeweeks before the annual report was filed; failed to disclose in atimely manner that Godfrey obtained control of the company inDecemeber 1988; and failed to disclose that the Comptroller of theCurrency declared the company's sole subsidiary and primary asset,Security National Bank of Shreveport, insolvent and put it underthe control of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.   Hiler said the company's shares were not traded on any exchangeor the National Association of Security Dealers quotation systemfor over-the-counter stocks.   The lawsuit seeks a court order barring the company and Godfreyfrom any further alleged violations of securities law and requiringcompliance with SEC disclosure rules.
