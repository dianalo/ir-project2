(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   When Herman Krone's drought-stricken farmin southern Illinois was picked for a visit Thursday by PresidentReagan, his corn crop was shriveling and his pastures were parched.   But his farm recorded nearly 2 inches of rain this week, turningthe fields into muddy pastures.   And 25 miles away in Marion, near the Williamson County Airportwhere Air Force One will land, motorists drove through floodeddowntown streets.   Still, agriculture experts insist that recent rain _ up to 4inches over some of the flatland region _ won't help much of thealready damaged corn crop. But the Reagan visit, they say, is agood gesture on the president's part and should help get federalaid for farmers who have substantial crop loss.   Reagan is scheduled for stops in Moline, Ill., and neighboringDavenport, Iowa, before he returns to Washington.</TEXT><DATELINE>OAK BROOK, Ill.
