Mr. McMillin, vice president and manager of Olympia Oyster Co., a processor, has nursed the small, coveted bivalves through near-fatal bouts of pollution and predation over the past 39 years.    He recalls that several years ago the mollusks had become the world's rarest oysters, and that their survival was in grave doubt. He received a telephone call about that time from the chef at New York's Four Seasons Restaurant, seeking a rush order because of a food critic's glowing account of the tasty mollusks.    Mr. McMillin could only reply with a sigh that he might spare a pint of the oysters -- if the chef was willing to wait a year or so.    This year was supposed to be a different story. With acres of healthy Olympias sitting on the bottom of this sleepy little bay last January and a Hong Kong millionaire ready to snap them up at the premium price of $200 a gallon, Mr. McMillin figured the oyster's time had come.    He figured wrong. &quot;I went away for a weekend vacation, and we got hit with the worst storm of the century,&quot; he says. Mr. McMillin raced home to find a blizzard blanketing Puget Sound and record-low temperatures freezing his oyster beds. Three-quarters of the Olympias perished. The Hong Kong high roller disappeared.    &quot;Sometimes,&quot; says Mr. McMillin, nearing the fourth decade of his fight to save the Olympia, &quot;I don't think God wants me to sell these oysters.&quot;    Olympias, once prevalent all along the northern Pacific Coast, now are found in commercial quantities only in Totten Inlet and a neighboring small bay at the foot of Puget Sound. But the Olympia has spawned a cult of admirers far and wide among food experts. James Beard, the legendary chef and food writer, was so taken with the Olympia's flavor that he included a recipe for them in his autobiography. Another fan, Julia Child, says, &quot;They're so unusual, so small, so rare.&quot; Adds New York cooking school owner Peter Kump, &quot;They're like truffles. What you can't have, you want.&quot;    Olympia devotees sometimes show up at the door of Mr. McMillin's ramshackle oyster processing plant here, begging for samples. Even during months without the letter R, when oysters are usually avoided because their spawning affects the taste, calls for Olympias come from aficianados as far away as Boston and Washington, D.C. &quot;Olympias taste like heaven,&quot; says Stephen LaHaie, general manager of Shaw's Crab House in Chicago.    Jon Rowley, a Seattle-based seafood restaurant consultant, becomes positively lyrical in describing the Olympia's flavor. &quot;It's very sweet, with a high metallic finish that is characteristic of oysters from Europe,&quot; he says. Others say the Olympia's size -- about the diameter of a quarter-- is appealing to some consumers who might be skittish at downing larger raw oysters.    More than a century ago, gold-rush gourmets paid up to $20 for a plate of Olympias. (Archeologists recently unearthed a 12-foot-thick vein of Olympia shells behind the remains of one Gold Rush-era eatery in Sacramento.) The &quot;Hang Town Fry&quot; -- a concoction of eggs and oysters -- is said to have been invented during the last century by a condemned man in Placerville, Calif., who requested the two most expensive items in town for his last meal.    When entrepreneurs discovered they could make more money digging oysters than panning gold, they cleaned the Olympias out of every coastal bay as far north as Washington State. Water pollution and oyster predators just about completed the job over the next century. Olympia production, which stood at more than 90,000 gallons at the turn of the century, dwindled to only about 500 gallons a year in the 1980s.    Mr. McMillin is spearheading the Olympia's last stand. A 64-year-old marine biologist of bulky girth and near-infinite patience (his hobby, grafting fruit trees, is another pastime not for the fidgety), he has nursed the slow-growing and finicky Olympias along ever since he came to work for the oyster company in 1950.    When a local pulp mill pouring chemical waste into a nearby bay threatened to wipe out his oysters, he sued the mill. Although he lost the suit, the pulp makers eventually gave up the fight and closed the mill in 1957.    The next crisis resulted from the importing of Pacific Oysters from Japan as insurance against the erratic Olympia harvest. But along with the Pacifics came a predator, the Japanese Oyster Drill. The tiny crustaceans had a hearty appetite for the Olympias, easily boring through their thin shells and gobbling them up. Mr. McMillin watched with anguish as his beds were again decimated. &quot;We brought in the Pacifics to make sure we could make enough money to save the Olympias,&quot; he says, &quot;and they almost wiped us out.&quot;    Sitting in his office overlooking the oyster beds, Mr. McMillin relates with relish the tale of the Olympia's dramatic rescue from the Oyster Drill's clutches: Just as the Olympia looked like a goner, he says, the black-clawed crab, another tiny underwater denizen that had been nearly wiped out here by pollution, made a sudden reappearance. Like the cavalry coming over the hill, the crabs attacked the Oyster Drills, and the Olympia was saved.    With the pulp-mill pollution gone and the Oyster Drill routed, Olympias began to thrive. The oyster takes about four to five years to reach full maturity -- more than twice as long as most other oyster species. But Mr. McMillin recalls going out on his carefully diked oyster beds late last year to find Olympias everywhere, nearly ready for harvest. &quot;Thousands of bushels,&quot; he says, eyes alight at the recollection. &quot;I said, 'Thank you Lord.'&quot;    Although the January freeze ended that dream, Mr. McMillin remains optimistic about the Olympias' future. The bitter cold apparently caused a boom in crustacean fertility. The oyster beds are alive with little Olympias.    He pulls on a pair of hip boots and invites a reporter to slog along out on the tidal flats where the oyster beds are located. Indeed, tiny Olympias are everywhere in the muddy beds, clinging to the shells of their departed ancestors.    Mr. McMillin moves into slightly deeper water, reaches down, and gathers up a handful of survivors from last winter's depredation. He pulls out a pocket knife and pries open several of the little oysters, which he shares.    The oysterman listens as his guest describes the flavor: a clear, briny tang, with a low, mellow undertone. All true, he says, but there is another quality that is probably the real reason for the rare little oyster's allure.    And what is that? Pearls? No, these aren't pearl oysters. Mr. McMillin pops an Olympia into his mouth and smiles. &quot;Snob appeal,&quot; he says. </TEXT></DOC>
