Now, Ms. Hassan, whose husband is fighting with rebelforces against the Somali government, fears that new rulesrestricting asylum will force her to move again -- back toAfrica.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;If we go home, we die,&quot; she says.   Sweden, long famed as a sanctuary for U.S. draftresisters, Chilean dissidents and other exiles, is rapidlyclosing its doors. With the number of asylum-seekers soaring,and its generous welfare state already strained, Sweden haseffectively sealed its southern sea border and stepped updeportations of recent arrivals.   &quot;It is sad, but Sweden cannot keep trying to solve all theworld's problems on its own,&quot; says Marleen Andersson, animmigration official in Malmoe. Gazing wearily at the moundof asylum applications on her desk, she says about 80% ofsuch requests were granted last year. In 1990, she expectsthe rate to be half that.   Swedish officials point out that they have long taken morethan their share. Last year, 30,000 refugees poured into thecountry. In neighboring Finland, the figure was 174. Therenow is about one refugee in Sweden for every 50 natives.   But the change in Sweden also reflects the anti-immigrantsentiment sweeping across Europe. Isolated, bland andoverwhelmingly blond, Sweden always was an awkward haven forexiles from war and famine-torn Third World nations. Now,hostility towards &quot;svartskallar&quot; -- blackheads -- isincreasingly coming out of the closet.   &quot;There is a good climate in Africa and the Middle East, sowhy can't people make a good life there?&quot; asks Carl Herzlow,a right-wing politician and popular radio host in Malmoe.Answering his own question, he says, &quot;these people don'twork, that's why.&quot;   Echoing the view of many European officials, Mr. Herzlowsays the money spent on settling refugees could be used moreefficiently in the form of foreign aid. &quot;Houses in the MiddleEast are much lighter than in Sweden,&quot; he says. &quot;For everyone we build here, we could put up 10 in Africa.&quot;   Such talk strikes a chord among young Swedes, many of whomnow wait months for housing and other services. During Mayand June, there were repeated firebombings of refugee campsacross Sweden. At a mosque in Malmoe, young Swedes havesmashed the imam's car and threatened Moslems by mail andphone.   Liberal-minded Swedes fear their country has betrayed itsrole as a conscience to the Western world. &quot;We are stillsmall and rich, we don't have the excuses of a Germany orEngland,&quot; says Nils Sjoestrom, a Baptist pastor who workswith refugees in the southern port of Trelleborg. &quot;If wedon't offer refuge anymore, who will?&quot;   The answer, for now, is that no one is likely to pick upthe slack. Until June, refugees poured into Trelleborg aboardboats from East Germany, a common transit point for travelersfrom Africa and the Middle East. Now, Sweden regards EastGermany as a country of &quot;first asylum,&quot; so refugees arrivingfrom Germany can now be sent back to seek refuge in Berlin. Asimilar ruling earlier this year allowed Sweden to turn backhundreds of refugees arriving by boat from Poland. In Marchand April, as many as 500 refugees arrived by boat each dayin southern Swedish ports. In late July, the average was 35.   Robleh Ali and three other young Somalis had the bad luckto arrive from East Germany just hours after the new ruletook effect. They spent two nights in a Trelleborg apartmentbefore being put back on a boat. &quot;They are East Germany'sresponsibility now, not ours,&quot; says the deporting officer,assistant police chief Leif Pegreus. He adds that they were&quot;economic refugees&quot; rather than political exiles. Except inrare cases, Sweden now hews to the Geneva Conventiondefinition of a refugee as someone with a &quot;well-founded fear&quot;of persecution or imprisonment in his own country.   To Mr. Ali, such distinctions seem strange. With a civilwar that has destroyed the Somali economy and resulted inthousands of civilian deaths, &quot;the police do not need toarrest me,&quot; he says. &quot;The whole country is already a prison.&quot;   The 21-year-old student and his friends fled theirhometown, Hargeisa, on foot and walked for 10 days throughthe bush to reach Djibouti. There, they paid several hundreddollars for crudely forged Djibouti passports. Mr. Ali laterspent the rest of his money on a frayed black tuxedo jacket,during a stopover in Cairo. &quot;I was told in Europe they wearnice clothes,&quot; explains the youth, who chose Sweden as adestination because fellow Somalis told him it was &quot;peacefuland nice to refugees.&quot;   Mr. Ali's first view of Europe was a dingy East Berlintrain station where hundreds of East Europeans, many of themgypsies, bed down each night because they have nowhere elseto go.   It was to the train station that the Somalis returnedafter being deported from Sweden. &quot;I do not speak German, Ido not know any Germans,&quot; Mr. Ali says, counting what's leftof the money given to him by a generous Swede: $40, to besplit four ways. Unable to find any officials to help them,and bewildered by the chaos and anti-immigrant feeling inBerlin, the group eventually decides to find a way back toAfrica.   &quot;There is no place for us to run now,&quot; Mr. Ali says,&quot;except maybe the moon.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
