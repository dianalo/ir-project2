Leaving a Capitol Hill meeting with Republican senators, Bushsaid he told the lawmakers the House had ``acted decisively'' inapproving a capital gains tax cut last week and he wanted them tofollow suit.   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the administrationopposes a proposal to remove the capital gains tax cut from a majordeficit-reduction bill to consider it separately.   ``We believe capital gains (reduction) is important. It's beenpart of the process from the very beginning. It's already passedthe House, and we believe now is the time to include it in thebill,'' he said.   Asked if Bush would veto the overall measure, needed to reducethe budget deficit for this year to below $110 billion and thusavoid across-the-board spending cuts, Fitzwater said: ``We want thecapital gains tax cut in there.''   Fitzwater said Bush stands ready to veto the overall measure ifit contains items ``that he finds onerous or inappropriate.'' Theadminstration ``can live with'' the automatic spending cuts thatlikely would be triggered later this month by such a veto ``if wehave to,'' the spokesman said.   Earlier, Sen. Bob Packwood, R-Ore., told a reporter he sensedthe White House wanted a promise from Democrats for clear shot at avote on capital gains. ``If they get that promise, I think theywill be happy to strip this bill,'' he said.   Sen. Pete V. Domenici, R-N.M., said Republicans won't drop thecapital gains tax cut from the bill if the only thing Democrats arewilling to do in return is to drop their proposal for a restorationof IRA deductions.   ``We're not going to do that kind of business,'' Domenici saidupon emerging from the meeting with Darman and Brady.   Sen. Bob Packwood, R-Ore., said he personally was willing tosettle for a promise by Democrats that the capital gains issuewould be considered as an amendment to another bill, possibly mustlegislation to raise the ceiling on the federal debt.   However, Packwood, who attended the meeting with Darman andBrady, added, ``That doesn't reflect the views of theadministration.''   As an amendment on the debt ceiling bill, Republicans would onlyhave to muster 50 votes instead of the 60 that might be needed toshut off a possible filibuster delaying its consideration on thebudget reduction bill..   Asked about criticism from some Democrats that thebudget-reconciliation bill is weighted down with the issues notrelated to cutting the deficit, Bush told reporters that thecapital gains cut was ``not an extraneous matter with me.''   The president thanked the lawmakers for ``extraordinarycooperation and leadership'' but added that ``there are bound to bedifferences between the White House and Senate'' on how to approachthe tax-and-spend issues.   Capital gains, which are profits from the sale of investments,now are fully taxed at the same rates as other income. Under theHouse-passed bill, the top rate of 33 percent would be cut to 19.6percent until 1992, when it would be raised to 28 percent and``indexed'' to avoid taxing gains arising solely from inflation.   Republicans have supported Bush on the tax cut, while mostDemocrats have opposed the idea.   Bush said that capital gains was ``not an extraneous matter withme'' and that he wants quick Senate action on the proposal.   The president also met with Senate Majority Leader GeorgeMitchell, D-Maine.   After the meeting with Mitchell, Bush walked onto the Senatefloor briefly, shaking hands with a few of the lawmakers there. Heleft just a few seconds later. Presidents normally appear only inthe House chamber for State of the Union speeches or other formaladdesses to joint sessions of Congress.   Associate Senate historian Don Ritchie said he had no record ofany previous chief executive casually strolling onto the floor.   Bush's appearance on Capitol Hill came as Republican senatorsworked with the administration to devise a capital gains tax cutthat could win enough Democratic support to pass the Senate thisweekend.   Packwood already had begun soliciting support for his owncapital gains plan. That proposal, which failed in the SenateFinance Committee on a 10-10 vote earlier this week, is expected tobe the starting point for whatever plan the Senate considers.   Under Packwood's proposal, the longer an investment was held,the less of its profits would be taxed when sold. Packwood seeks toadd the plan to a giant deficit-reduction bill as a substitute fora Democratic saving incentive that would expand tax-deductibleIndividual Retirement Accounts.   The House on Thursday passed its version of the deficit billthat included the capital gains reduction.   A surprise new element into the capital gains issue wasintroduced in the Senate on Thursday night.   Senate leaders expressed hope that the budget bill could bestripped of the hundreds of provisions attached to it that havenothing to do with reducing the deficit. Should that come about andif the House went along, it could prevent approval this year ofeither a capital gains cut or an IRA expansion.   Mitchell said so much has been tacked onto the budget bill thatit will be impossible to complete congressional action on it intime to prevent automatic across-the-board spending cuts from beingtriggered on Oct. 16.   Those cuts are required by the Gramm-Rudman balanced-budget lawwhen Congress cannot agree on revenue increases and spendingreductions.</TEXT></DOC>
