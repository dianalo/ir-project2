The billionaire property mogul has teamed with Milton Bradley,maker of some of the country's most popular games, and on Tuesdaythrew a media event in the glittering atrium of Trump Tower onManhattan's swank Fifth Avenue to unveil ``Trump The Game.''   Never known for hiding his light under a bushel, Trump stoodbeside a much-larger-than-life replica of the board game box cover _emblazoned with his widely familiar likeness _ as he tossed out aceremonial 14-karat die.   He drew applause from onlookers when he revealed he will donateto charities his share of the proceeds from sales of the game, whichgoes on store shelves in April for about $25.   ``I'll do as well as I can for Milton Bradley,'' said Trump. Henamed several charities, including AIDS research and helping thehomeless, as intended beneficiaries of his undisclosed portion ofthe profit.   George Ditomassi, Milton Bradley's president, declared ``Thisdeal is one that we truly believe is a golden opportunity for MiltonBradley. People are obviously fascinated by Donald Trump's world ofmultimillion-dollar wheeling and dealing.''   The company, a division of the big toymaker Hasbro Inc., intendsto make marketing the Trump game its top priority this year, hesaid. Milton Bradley will keep its percentage of the profit.   Milton Bradley and Trump teamed up to develop the game, whichtries to recreate the dealmaking of high-rolling real estatedevelopers.   Players advance their ``T'' tokens around the board and attemptto outbid each other for big-ticket properties, such as luxuryhotels, glitzy casinos and airlines. Once all the real estate hasbeen snapped up, players cut deals attempting to controlincreasingly bigger pieces of the action.   The game comes with ``Trump cards'' that players draw as theycarry out their buying and selling fantasies and fake cash with nodenominations smaller than $10 million. No need to mention whosepicture is on the play money.   ``Essentially, it's a much more sophisticated version ofMonopoly,'' said Trump, referring to the hugely successful ParkerBrothers game. ``I love Monopoly. I've played it all my life in manyforms.''   Will average Americans take to ``Trump The Game?''   Apparently, Milton Bradley is convinced of it. Lawrence I.Bernstein, a vice president for marketing, said more money will bespent promoting the game than on any other in the company's history.That covers famous titles like Candy Land, Chutes and Ladders andthe The Game of Life.   In an interview, Milton Bradley's president, Ditomassi, said thatjudging by the people who have read Trump's autobiography, ``Trump:The Art of the Deal,'' Trump has a following among people of allbackgrounds, not just millionaires.</TEXT></DOC>
