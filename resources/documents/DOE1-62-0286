It is now well established that virulentstrains of these bacterial species transfer a piece of bacterial DNAinto plant cells, thereby transforming these into tumor cells. In researchmuch attention has been paid to the agrobacteria for several reasons.First is the desire to develop a system for the genetic engineering ofplant cells based on the natural system for gene transfer between Agrobacteriumspecies and plant cells. Second, there is a striking resemblance betweenthe etiology of animal cancers and the plant cancer crown gall that wasrecognized as early as in 1927. This led to basic studies on the processof plant tumor induction and on the recovery of plant cells from thetumorous state. A third important interest lies in crown gall as a diseasethat is the cause of economically important losses in agriculture anhorticulture in Europe, North America, and Austrailia. Research has beenaimed at finding means to prevent crown gall and to cure plants of thisdisease.</TEXT></DOC>
