People really are concerned about the inflation outlook,&quot; said Alan C. Lerner, a managing director at Bankers Trust Co.    Prices of actively traded 30-year Treasury bonds plummeted about two points, or $20 for each $1,000 face amount. Early in the day, these issues had been up more than half a point.    The bond market collapse killed a powerful rally in stock prices. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which was up more than 44 points at 2:30 p.m. EDT, finished with a decline of 15 points at 2307.30.    In just the past six weeks, some long-term Treasury bonds have plunged more than 13 points in one of the sharpest setbacks ever. The latest 30-year Treasury bond now yields slightly more than 8 3/4%, an increase of nearly 1 1/4 percentage points from March 26. Corporate and municipal bond prices also fell yesterday, although much less than Treasury issues.    The main focus of attention was the extraordinary run-up in the Commodity Research Bureau's futures-price index. The index, which tracks 26 raw-material prices, is viewed by many investment managers as a good barometer of inflation pressures. Yesterday, the index jumped more than six points to 235.41 in one of the largest one-day increases ever.    Rapid increases in commodity prices have alarmed many investment managers amid widespread fear that higher inflation will translate into even higher interest rates soon. Concern about inflation already is running high because of the dollar's sharp drop in the foreign exchange markets, which has made imported goods more expensive and encouraged domestic producers to raise prices.    The dollar rose slightly against most other major currencies yesterday, although it eased slightly against the Japanese yen. For a change, though, it failed to produce much reaction in the credit markets. &quot;Everybody was watching the CRB index&quot; yesterday, said Alan Bozian, a first vice president of Union Bank of Switzerland.    Surging commodity prices may convince the Federal Reserve that it needs to go beyond its recent credit-tightening move and raise its discount rate, some analysts say. The discount rate, now 5 1/2%, is the rate the Fed charges on loans to banks and savings institutions.    Federal Reserve officials, as usual, haven't divulged their credit policy plans. Some analysts say a discount rate increase is badly needed to reassure investors that the Fed is serious about combating inflation.    Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker said yesterday that all the recent volatility in exchange rates and interest rates provides &quot;a little taste&quot; of how vulnerable the U.S. financial markets and economy have become to what foreign investors believe.    In a speech at Emory University in Atlanta, Mr. Volcker warned that the U.S. is in danger of losing control over its economic destiny. He also said criticism of other countries, including Japan, is misplaced as long as the U.S. can't get its own house in order.    Although that warning is similar to the message Mr. Volcker has been delivering in other recent commencement speeches, the Fed chairman's gloomy remarks added to the bond market's woes yesterday, several dealers said. They fear the dollar will drop again soon unless the Fed takes forceful action to raise interest rates.    The Fed &quot;must raise the discount rate to at least 6%, perhaps even 6 1/2%&quot; to help prop up the dollar, according to Charles F. Eaton III in the Campbell andamp; Eaton Report of UBS Securities Inc. He contended that the Fed &quot;has run out of options.&quot;    &quot;Volcker's comments about the U.S. losing control of its destiny certainly didn't help&quot; the bond markets yesterday, said E. Craig Coats Jr., a managing director of Salomon Brothers Inc. He also stressed the importance of commodity price movements, adding: &quot;From now on, as the CRB goes, so goes the bond market.&quot;    All the new Treasury notes and bonds auctioned last week by the government now are selling below their average auction levels. The Treasury's new 8 3/4% bonds due 2017 fell yesterday to a price of 99 21/32 from 101 23/32 Friday, as the yield rose to 8.78% from 8.59%. The Treasury auctioned the new issue last Thursday afternoon at an average yield of 8.76%.    The government's new 8 1/2% notes due 1997 dropped to 99 10/32 from 100 1/2 Friday, while the yield rose to 8.6% from 8.42%. The Treasury sold the issue last Wednesday at an average annual yield of 8.52%.    The Treasury's new 7 7/8% notes due in three years fell yesterday to a price of 99 3/4 from 100 6/32, while the yield surged to 7.96% from 7.8%. The average annual yield at the three-year note auction last Tuesday was 7.91%.    Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.'s index of long-term Treasury bonds dropped 20.41 points to 1278.44. It ranged between 1276.10 and 1306.29.    Rates on short-term Treasury bills rose sharply compared with Friday's closing levels, mainly reflecting speculation that Congress will approve an increase in the nation's debt ceiling soon. Earlier in the day, when the Treasury held its weekly bill auction, traders said they had expected yet another snag in passing the debt-ceiling increase, which in turn would have forced the Treasury to postpone next week's sale.    The average rate on new 13-week bills sold yesterday was 5.47%, down from 5.81% at the previous auction last Monday, while the average rate on new 26-week bills declined to 5.74% from 6.16%.    In the corporate new-issue market, a $250 million issue of Ford Motor Credit Co. notes, due May 15, 1994, was offered to investors. The 8 7/8% notes were priced at 99.65 to yield 8.943%, according to Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co., which headed the underwriting group. The notes, which are non-callable, are rated double-A-2 by Moody's Investors Service Inc. and double-A-minus by Standard andamp; Poor's Corp.    In the municipal market, a proposed offering of about $260 million of revenue refunding bonds by the Kentucky Turnpike Authority was tentatively priced yesterday by underwriters led by Cranston Securities Co. Under the preliminary scale, yields range from 6% on bonds due 1991 to 8.6% on zero-coupon bonds due 2006.    Here are details from yesterday's Treasury bill auction:    Rates are determined by the difference between the purchase price and face value. Thus, higher bidding narrows the investor's return while lower bidding widens it. The percentage rates are calculated on a 360-day year, while the coupon equivalent yield is based on a 365-day year.                                13-Week         26-Week Applications ............. $20,818,585,000  $22,249,950,000 Accepted bids ............. $6,411,525,000    6,403,100,000 Accepted at low price ................ 14%              41% Accepted noncompet'ly ..... $1,127,485,000     $794,800,000 Average price (Rate) ........ 98.617(5.47%)   97.098(5.74%) High price (Rate) ........... 98.630(5.42%)   97.118(5.70%) Low price (Rate) ............ 98.610(5.50%)   97.083(5.77%) Coupon equivalent ..................  5.64%           6.01%   Both issues are dated May 14.
