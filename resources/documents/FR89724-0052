We conducted verification of the questionnaireresponses of the Government of Canada and the provincial governments ofAlberta, Manitoba, Ontario, Quebec and Saskatchewan in Canada from May15 to June 1, 1989. Respondents submitted amended responses and additionalclarifying information requested at verification on May 24, June 13, June14, June 15, June 22 and June 30, 1989.Both petitioner and respondents requested a public hearing in this investigation.Case briefs were filed by petitioner and respondents on June 23 and rebuttalbriefs were filed on June 27, 1989. The hearing was held on June 28, 1989.During the hearing, one party presented oral arguments which had not beenincluded in a rebuttal brief. Under section 355.38(b) of the Commerce Department'sregulations, published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on December 27, 1988 (to be codified at 19 CFR355.38(b)), during the hearing ``an interested party may make an affirmativepresentation only on arguments included in that party's case brief andmay make a rebuttal presentation only on arguments included in that party'srebuttal brief.'' For this reason, that party's rebuttal presentation hasbeen stricken from the transcripts of the hearing. We wish to remind allinterested parties that, in all hearings before the Department, we willstrictly enforce the requirements of section 355.38(b).<ITAG tagnum="84">Scope of Investigation</ITAG>The United States has developed a system of tariff classification basedon the international harmonized system of customs nomenclature. On January1, 1989, the U.S. tariff schedules were fully converted to the <T3>Harmonized Tariff Schedule </T3>(HTS), and all merchandise enteredor withdrawn from warehouse for consumption on or after that date is nowclassified solely according to the appropriate HTS item number(s). TheDepartment is providing both the appropriate <T3>Tariff Schedules of the United States Annotated </T3>(TSUSA) item number(s)and the appropriate HTS item number(s) with product descriptions for convenienceand Customs purposes. The Department's written description of the productsunder investigation remains dispositive as to the scope of the productscovered by this investigation.The products covered by this investigation are fresh, chilled, and frozenpork, currently provided for under TSUSA item numbers 106.4020 and 106.4040,and currently classifiable under HTS item numbers 0203.11.00, 0203.12.90,0203.19.40, 0203.21.00, 0203.22.90, and 0203.29.40. Specifically excludedfrom this investigation are any processed or otherwise prepared or preservedpork products such as canned hams, cured bacon, sausage and ground pork.<ITAG tagnum="84">Application of Section 771B</ITAG>Section 1313 of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988 amendedthe Tariff Act of 1930 to include a new section 771B. This section readsas follows:<ITAG tagnum="24">In the case of an agricultural product processed from a raw agriculturalproduct in which_</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">(1) the demand for the prior stage product is substantially dependenton the demand for the latter stage product, and </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">(2) the processing operation adds only limited value to the raw commodity,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="20">subsidies found to be provided to either producers or processors ofthe product shall be deemed to be provided with respect to the manufacture,production, or exportation of the processed product.</ITAG>The subject merchandise in this investigation is an agricultural product,fresh, chilled, and frozen pork, processed from a raw agricultural product,live swine. Therefore, in this investigation, we must analyze the elementsof section 771B to determine whether the subsidies provided to producersor processors of live swine shall be deemed to be provided with respectto the manufacture, production, or exportation of fresh, chilled, and frozenpork. For the reasons discussed below, we determine that the elements ofsection 771B are met.Prior to the enactment of section 771B, the Department considered a benefitto producers of a raw agricultural product as a benefit to producers ofa processed agricultural product. See <T3>Certain Fish from Canada: Final Countervailing Duty Determination </T3>(43FR 25996, June 16, 1978); <T3>Lamb Meat from New Zealand: Preliminary Affirmative CountervailingDuty Determination </T3>(46 FR 58128, November 30, 1981); <T3>Final Affirmative Countervailing Duty Determination: Live Swine andFresh, Chilled, and Frozen Pork Products from Canada (Swine) </T3>(50 FR25098, June 15, 1985); <T3>Final Affirmative Countervailing Duty Determination and Order: LambMeat from New Zealand (Lamb Meat 1985) </T3>(50 FR 37708, September 17,1985); <T3>Preliminary Affirmative Countervailing Duty Determination: Red Raspberriesfrom Canada </T3>(50 FR 42574, October 21, 1985); <T3>Final Affirmative Countervailing Duty Determination and Order: Ricefrom Thailand </T3>(51 FR 12356, April 10, 1986); and <T3>Final Affirmative Countervailing Duty Determination: Certain FreshAtlantic Groundfish from Canada (Groundfish) </T3>(51 FR 10041, March 24,1986). For example, in <T3>Swine</T3>, respondents argued that the Department should apply theupstream subsidy provision, section 771A of the Act, to determine if benefitsto hog producers passed through to pork producers. We disagreed becausewe did not consider live swine to be an ``input'' into unprocessed pork.Instead, we considered benefits to hog producers as direct benefits topork producers. Therefore, since we otherwise did not find reasonable groundsto believe or suspect that an upstream subsidy was being paid or bestowedwith respect to unprocessed pork, we did not conduct an upstream subsidyinvestigation. We clearly spelled out in <T3>Swine </T3>our reasons for determining that benefits to hog producersdirectly benefit pork producers. ``We believe there are two characteristicswhich evidence that live swine should not be considered an `input' intofresh, frozen, and chilled pork products. These characteristics are levelof value added and the role of the producer.'' First, in our discussionof value added we said, ``A low level of value added at a given level ofprocessing is an indication that the prior stage product entering thatlevel is not an input into the processed product.'' Second, in our discussionof the role of the processor and whether the processor merely makes theproduct ready for the next consumer we said, ``The salient criterion isthe degree to which the demand for the prior stage product is dependenton the demand for the latter stage product.'' Respondents in <T3>Swine </T3>appealed the Department's decision not to apply the upstreamsubsidies provision. The Court of International Trade (CIT) remanded <T3>Swine </T3>to the Department of conduct an upstream subsidy investigation.The CIT ruled that Commerce had to apply the upstream subsidy provisionbecause it found no exception to that provision for agricultural productseither in the statute or in the legislative history. <T3>See, Canadian Meat Council </T3>v. <T3>United States, </T3>661 F. Supp. 622 (1987). The decision of the CITcan only be considered advisory, however, because its later decision touphold the ITC's negative injury determination regarding the domestic industryfor pork products mooted its remand instructions. <T3>See, National Pork Producers Council </T3>v. <T3>United States, </T3>661 F. Supp. 633 (1987). In light of the Court'sdecision, Congress amended the Act by adding section 771B to codify theDepartment's practice. 133 Cong. Rec. S8814-16 (daily ed. June 16, 1989).In this investigation, we determine that the first criterion of section771B is met because the demand for live swine depends substantially uponthe demand for fresh, chilled, and frozen pork. Swine producers raise mostswine for slaughter. Pork constitutes the primary product of the slaughteredpig. Thus, the demand for pork and for live swine are inextricably linked,a fact recognized by the provincial hog marketing boards, which activelypromote the consumption of pork to increase the demand for live swine.The demand for live swine to be processed further, <T3>e.g., </T3>into canned ham or sausage, still requires that the liveswine first be processed as fresh, chilled, and frozen pork. In this regard,the demand for fresh, chilled, and frozen pork incorporates both the retailcustomer who demands fresh, chilled, and frozen pork for consumption andthe wholesale customer who demands fresh, chilled, and frozen pork forfurther processing. The second criterion of section 771B is also met in this investigationbecause the processing operation used to manufacture fresh, chilled, andfrozen pork adds limited value to the live swine. We verified that porkproducers in Canada add, on average, approximately 20 percent in valueto the live swine. This figure, however, encompasses various levels ofprocessing that often go beyond the initial steps needed to first makea pig into pork. That is, to make the product under this investigation,the pork manufacturer immobilizes, kills, washes, dehairs, eviscerates,and splits the hog. After the pork producer weighs the carcass, he thenremoves the head and kidneys and trims air pockets or diseased portions.The split carcass now classifies as fresh, chilled, and frozen pork.  While a percentage figure for value added helps focus our evaluation ofthe second element of section 771B, it does not resolve the question ofwhether the processing operation adds only <T3>limited </T3>value to the raw commodity. The pork producers incur mostof their cost in processing the live swine into split carcasses. The additionalcost associated with processing the split carcass into primal or trimmedcuts is small relative to the price which these cuts receive in the market.For example, we verified that, in some cases, a flick of the knife transformeda primal cut into a more expensive, trimmed cut. As explained by the GeneralManager for the Canadian Meat Council, ``It has made practical and economicsense for the industry to do this additional fat trimming at the plantlevel due to high returns for the fat credits and, in many cases, the fatis removed without additional labour.'' Thus, the figure of 20 percentvalue added to a degree corresponds to the higher profits earned in themarketplace by product presentation, and not the cost of processing thesplit carcass into primal or trimmed cuts. For these reasons, we find inthis investigation that the processing operation adds only limited valueto the raw commodity because the processing represented by the figure of20 percent has not changed the essential character of the live swine.Therefore, for the reasons set forth above, we determine that subsidiesfound to be provided to live swine shall be deemed to be provided withrespect to the manufacture, production, or exportation of fresh, chilled,and frozen pork in accordance with section 771B of the Act.<ITAG tagnum="84">Analysis of Programs</ITAG>We streamlined this investigation because of the large number of programsinvolved, the large number of swine and pork producers in Canada, and thefact that we have previously examined most of the programs upon which weinitiated, and decided to examine only swine and pork producers in theprovinces of Quebec, Ontario, Alberta, Manitoba, and Saskatchewan. Thesefive provinces accounted for 92.5 percent of hogs slaughtered in Canadain 1987, the most recent year for which such information is available.We used our standard methodology to calculate benefits under grant programs.Grants provided on a recurring basis are expensed in the year of receipt.For non-recurring grants, we totalled the grants provided under each programand divided that amount by the total sales value of the subject merchandisefrom the five provinces examined for purposes of this investigation. Ifthe sum was less than 0.5 percent of the sales concerned, we expensed suchgrants in the year of receipt. Since we have not received sales informationfor the years prior to the review period, we used as best information availablethe sales value for 1988, as reported in the response, to determine ifgrants received prior to 1988 should be allocated over time or expensedin the year of receipt. Based on this methodology, all grants were expensedin the year of receipt.In both <T3>Swine </T3>and this investigation, we have used a conversion factorto calculate the percentage of pork yield from live swine. This percentageis then used in calculating the subsidy. Both respondents and petitionerhave made suggestions as to the appropriate conversion factor. We haveselected a conversion factor of 79.5 percent as verified for the reviewperiod.We believe that 79.5 percent is the most appropriate conversion factorto use because the two largest countervailable programs in this investigation,the tripartite program and the Quebec Farm Income Stabilization InsuranceProgram, both use similar conversion factors. Of the conversion factorswhich have been proposed in this investigation, the factor of 79.5 percentmost closely approximates the conversion factor used by the stabilizationprograms and the provincial marketing boards and packers in determiningthe final price to be paid for the live swine.In the <T3>Final Results of Countervailing Duty Administrative Review; Live Swinefrom Canada, </T3>54 Fed. Reg. 651 (1989) <T3>(Live Swine Review), </T3>separate rates were calculated for markethogs and for sows and boars. Sows and boars were determined to be a distinctsubclass of merchandise. Both respondents and petitioner have argued thata separate rate should be applied for sow and boar meat. In light of thepractice established in the administrative review, and the arguments providedby respondents and petitioner, we have calculated a separate rate for sowand boar meat. For those programs where sows and boars are not eligiblefor benefits, we have allocated payments only to market hogs. For additionalinformation on this issue, see Comment 11.We discovered the Quebec Reimbursement of Municipal and Educational TaxesProgram, which may provide different levels of tax rebates to farmers basedon regional criteria, too late in the investigation to gather sufficientinformation to be used in this determination. If a final countervailingduty order is issued in this investigation, we will examine this programin any subsequent 751 review.For purposes of this final determination, the period for which we are measuringsubsidies (``the review period'') is calendar year 1988.Based upon our analysis of the petition, the responses to our questionnaire,verification, and written comments from respondents and petitioner, wedetermine the following:I. Programs Determined To Confer SubsidiesWe determine that subsidies are being provided to producers or exportersin Canada of fresh, chilled, and frozen pork under the following programs:<ITAG tagnum="81">A. Federal Programs </ITAG>1. <T3>Tripartite Programs under the Agricultural Stabilization Act. </T3>TheAgricultural Stabilization Act (ASA) of 1958 was passed by the federalgovernment to provide for the price stabilization of certain agriculturalcommodities. In 1975, the ASA was amended to revise the list of named commoditiesto cattle, hogs, sheep, industrial milk and cream, corn, soybeans, andoats and barley grown outside the Canadian Wheat Board designated areas.The support formula was update to a minimum of 90 percent of a five yearaverage market price plus an index to reflect production cost changes.In January 1985, the ASA was further amended by Bill C-25, which authorizedthe Minister of Agriculture, with the approval of the Governor in Council,to enter into tripartite agreements with the provinces and/or producersto provide price stabilization schemes for any natural or processed productof agriculture. The Minister may enter into a tripartite agreement onlyafter he determines that it will not give a financial advantage to someproducers in the production or marketing of the product not enjoyed byother producers of the same product in Canada and that it will not providean incentive to overproduce. The Bill also amended the Act by (1) changing``sheep'' to ``lamb and wool,'' (2) adding to the list of named commoditiesspring and winter wheat grown outside the Canadian Wheat Board designatedareas, and (3) providing for different support periods with respect todifferent commodities (<T3>e.g.</T3> quarterly periods for livestock). Tripartite agreements on hogs were signed effective January 1, 1986, withAlberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, and Ontario. An amended agreement wassigned on February 8, 1989, adding the Provinces of British Columbia, Quebec,New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, and Nova Scotia. Under the terms ofthe tripartite agreements on hogs, the provinces, with the exception ofQuebec, may not offer separate stabilization plans or other <T3>ad hoc </T3>assistance for hogs, nor may the federal government offercompensation to hog producers in a province not a party to the agreement.The tripartite scheme provides for a five-year phase-in period to adjustfor differences between the tripartite scheme and previously existing provincialprograms. Existing provincial stabilization plans, with the exception ofthe Quebec Farm Income Stabilization Program, are to be completely phasedout by 1991. The tripartite agreements on hogs are administered by the StabilizationCommittee (``Committee'') in conjunction with the Agricultural StabilizationBoard (``Board''). The Committee calculates the stabilization paymentson a quarterly basis in the following manner. First, it calculates a ``supportprice,'' which is equal to the cash costs of production in the current13-week period plus 95 percent of the average margin in the same 13-weekperiod for the preceding five years. The margin for any period is equalto the national average market price for the period minus the nationalaverage cash costs in that period. The difference between the support priceand the average market price is the amount of stabilization payment. Stabilizationpayments are triggered in any 13-week period that the market price fallsbelow the support price. Payments are made only on hogs indexing 80 orabove, thereby automatically excluding sows and boars. To date, tripartite ageements have been signed for the following commodities:hogs, cattle, cows/calves, lambs, sugar beets, apples, white pea beansand other dry edible beans, honey, and yellow seeded onions. We verifiedthat producers of one commodity, asparagus, requested a tripartite agreementand were rejected. Producers of two other commodities, sour cherries andcorn, have also requested agreements, but no agreements are being drawnup for these commodities. Support payments under the tripartite agreements for various commoditiesare calculated in the manner described above, using a formula ranging from85 to 95 percent of the average market price over the past five years plusan index to reflect production cost changes. We verified that the supportlevel for beef and apples, both of which are covered under tripartite agreements,is 85 percent, as compared to the 95 percent used for hogs. As federal and provincial payments to hog producers are now made pursuantto tripartite agreements, rather than as named commodities under the ASA,we must, as respondents have argued, focus on the tripartite program andconsider whether it is, <T3>de jure </T3>or <T3>de facto, </T3>limited to a specific enterprise or industry, or groupof enterprises or industries, within the meaning of section 771(5)(B) ofthe Act. We typically consider three factors in determining whether a program islimited to a specific enterprise or industry or group of enterprises orindustries: (1) The extent to which a foreign government acts (as demonstratedin the language of the relevant enacting legislation and implementing regulations)to limit the availability of a program; (2) the number of enterprises,industries, or groups thereof that actually use a program, which may includethe examination of disproportionate or dominant users; and (3) the extent,and manner in which, the government exercises discretion in making theprogram available.Pursuant to the first factor, we verified that there is no <T3>de jure </T3>limitation as to which commodities may be covered undertripartite agreements. Thus, we find that the federal government did notact to limit the availability of the tripartite program. Pursuant to the second factor, by its terms, the ASA, as amended, providesthat any agricultural product may be covered under a tripartite agreement.However, since the January 1985 amendment authorizing tripartite agreements,only nine out of an innumerable number of agricultural commodities havebeen incorporated under such agreements. Furthermore, not all producerswho request tripartite agreements for their commodities obtain such agreements.For example, agreements for sour cherries and corn have not been drawnup because of ``administrative difficulties'' involving the valuation ofland and other factors, despite the fact that an agreement already existsfor apples, a commodity with similar valuation problems. Asparagus growerswere rejected because government officials deemed there was little needfor an asparagus agreement due to the rising price of asparagus and therelatively small value of asparagus sales. Pursuant to the third factor, we found that discretion in the administrationof the tripartite program, which results in different treatment for differentcommodities, is exercised in the following ways. First, there are no explicitor standard criteria for evaluating tripartite agreement requests. Neitherthe ASA, as amended, nor the regulations and guidelines concerning tripartiteagreements, establish procedures or criteria for when a commodity is tobecome subject to a tripartite agreement. In practice, it is ultimatelyat the Ministry's discretion whether to implement a request for a tripartiteagreement (see Comment 7). Second, we verified that the level of price stabilization and the termsof each scheme varies, at the discretion of the government, from commodityto commodity. For parity of benefits among the producers of different commoditiesto exist, it is essential that the cost of production elements in the stabilizationformulas for various commodities be comparable to one another. That is,the cost of production model used for the swine program should reflectthe actual cost of production experience of swine producers to the sameextent that the model for other commodities reflects the actual cost ofproduction experience of producers of those commodities. At verification,we learned that cost of production models do not necessarily reflect theexperience of the relevant producer group. Furthermore, the support level has varied historically for the same productand is ofter different for different commodities. For example, the supportlevel for hogs was raised from 93 percent to 95 percent in an effort toget Quebec to sign a tripartite agreement on hogs. Moreover, as noted above,the suport level for apples and beef is only 85 percent., We were toldduring verification that the Committee worked with different support modelsfor these commodities, and that a model was originally devised for beefin which the support level would be 50 percent. However, due to oppositionto that support level, it was raised to the present level but elementsin the cash cost component of the model were dropped. Thus, the incomesof producers of certain covered commodities are being stabilized to a significantlygreater or lesser extent than those of others for no objective reasons.Even among swine producers, benefits are not available on equal terms.Indeed, it appears that, by allowing Quebec to keep its provincial hogstabilization program, the Ministry is undermining the general guidelinesof the tripartite program by giving an advantage to some producers in theproduction of hogs not enjoyed by other producers of the same product inCanada.For the foregoing reasons, we determine the tripartite program to be limitedto a group of enterprises or industries, and therefore countervailable.To calculate the benefit under this program, we first calculated the dressed-weightequivalent of hogs marketed during the review period in the five provincesexamined for purposes of this investigation (less sows and boars). To obtainthe dressed-weight equivalent, we used the live-weight to dressed-weightconversion factor of 79.5 percent as verified for the review period. Sincethe stabilization payments are disbursed from a pool of funds made up ofequal contributions from the federal government, provincial governments,and producer premiums, plus interest, we multiplied the stabilization paymentswhich we verified were made to hog producers during the review period bytwo-thirds to factor out the producer premiums. We then allocated the resultover the dressed-weight equivalent of hogs marketed in the five provincesduring the review period (less sows and boars) to obtain an estimated netsubsidy of Can$0.027486/kg. (Can$0.012468/lb.) for fresh, chilled, andfrozen pork. Because sows and boars are ineligible for benefits under thisprogram, we determine the benefit to be zero for sow and boar meat.2. <T3>Feed Freight Assistance Program. </T3>The Feed Freight Assistance Programwas administered by Agriculture Canada until 1967, when the Livestock FeedAct (LFA) was passed and the Livestock Feed Board was formed to administerthe program. Parliament enacted the LFA in response to domestic feed grainsupply problems and price fluctuations in eastern Canada and British Columbia.The Board ensures the availability of feed grain to meet the needs of livestockfeeders, the availability of adequate storage space in eastern Canada forfeed grain, and price stability for feed grain in eastern Canada, BritishColumbia, the Yukon, and the Northwest Territories. Only users of feedgrain, <T3>i.e., </T3>those who buy it to feed livestock (commercial mills andlivestock producers), are eligible for assistance.Eligibility for the program is restricted to feed grain millers in ``designatedareas'' (Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta and parts of British Columbia)whose grain is fed to livestock, and to livestock owners in parts of easternCanada and British Columbia, and in the Yukon Territory and the NorthwestTerritories.To qualify for assistance, the feed grain must be transported outside thefarm where it is grown and moved through commercial channels. Commercialchannels are defined as transactions that provide an invoice, weight certificate,grade certificate, and bill of lading. Payments are made only on grainthat will be fed to livestock.Benefits are provided for transporting and storing feed. Payments for feedgrain transportation are set per ton according to the destination of thegrain. Feed grain storage payments are made on a product-specific basis.Because this program is limited to feed grain millers in the above described``designated areas'' whose grain is fed to livestock, and to livestockowners in parts of eastern Canada and British Columbia, and in the YukonTerritory and the Northwest Territories, we, determine that it is limitedto a specific enterprise or industry, or group of enterprises or industries,and is therefore countervailable.Of the five provinces we are examining for purposes of this investigation,livestock owners in only Ontario and Quebec are eligible for assistanceunder the program. We found that no benefits were provided to hog producersin Ontario. Therefore, we are only considering the assistance providedto Quebec producers. We verified that 2.7 percent of all payments underthis program went to livestock owners in Quebec. At verification we foundthat 50 percent of feed grains were consumed by hogs. Therefore, to calculatethe benefit to hog producers, we used 1.35 percent (50 percent of 2.7 percent)of total payments as the benefit to hog producers. We divided this totalby the dressed-weight equivalent of hogs marketed during the review periodin the five provinces to obtain an estimated net subsidy of Can$0.000034/kg.(Can$0.000016/lb.) for fresh, chilled, and frozen pork and for sow andboar meat.3. <T3>Western Diversification Program. </T3>The Western Diversification Programwas established by the federal government in August 1987 to diversify theeconomic base of western Canada (British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewanand Manitoba). The program was established as a five-year program witha $1.2 billion diversification fund. Assistance is provided in the formof ``contributions,'' either repayable or non-repayable. The amount offunding provided, as well as the terms and conditions attached to it, aredetermined on a project-by-project basis. The federal government fundsthe program; provincial governments do not. Interest is rarely chargedon repayable assistance. Eligible projects include new product development,plant establishment, new market development, industry-wide productivityimprovement, feasibility studies or new technology. Upon approval of aproject, an offer of financial assistance is made. Contributions are disbursedquarterly, usually after the project is completed.Because this program is limited to western Canada, we determine that itis limited to enterprises or industries located in a specific region ofCanada, and is therefore, countervailable. We verified that, of the projectsapproved to date, only one provided benefits on the production of hogsor the processing of pork during the review period.To calculate the benefit, since we do not have the calendar year 1988 figures,we used as best information available the non-repayable contribution disbursedto the one hog/pork-related project during fiscal year 1988-1989 and dividedit by the dressed-weight equivalent of hogs marketed during the reviewperiod in the five provinces to obtain an estimated net subsidy of Can$0.000105/kg.(Can$0.000048/lb.) for fresh, chilled, and frozen pork and for sow andboar meat.4. <T3>Western Transportation Industrial Development Program.</T3> Under thisprogram, assistance was provided by the federal government to manufacturing,processing and related service industries in Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Albertaand British Columbia. This program expired in June 1988 and was incorporatedinto the Western Diversification Program.Because this program is limited to firms in the four provinces of westernCanada, we determine that it is limited to enterprises or industries locatedin a specific region of Canada, and is therefore countervailable.To calculate the benefit under this program, we divided the grants attributableto pork production during the review period by the dressed-weight equivalentof hogs marketed during the review period in the five provinces to yieldan estimated net subsidy of Can$0.000054/kg. (Can$0.000025/lb.) for fresh,chilled, and frozen pork and for sow and boar meat.<ITAG tagnum="81">B. Federal Provincial Program</ITAG>1. <T3>Canada/Quebec Subsidiary Agreement on Agri-Food Development</T3>: TheSubsidiary Agreement on Agri-Food Development is pursuant to an Economicand Regional Development Agreement (ERDA) between the Government of Canadaand the Province of Quebec. Programs funded under the Subsidiary Agreementinclude the following:<ITAG tagnum="15"/><T3>Program 1:</T3> Research and Development; A. Contract Research; B.Food Research<ITAG tagnum="15"/><T3>Program 2:</T3> Technological Innovations and New Initiatives; A. AgriculturalProduction; B.

Soil and Water Conservation Research; C.Technology Transfer in Soil and Water Conservation</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Funding for each program and subprogram for the duration of the SubsidiaryAgreement is estimated at Can$35 million, and is split evenly between thefederal and provincial governments.Of the seven subprograms available, we verified that only three, 1.A.,2.A. and 3.B., include hog-related projects. Of these projects, those undersubprogram 1.A. were contracted with universities or research institutions,and the one under subprogram 3.B. was contracted with a consulting firm.We verified that the projects under these two subprograms included provisionsfor making the research results publicly available. (See Section II ofthe notice, <T3>Programs Determined to be Not Countervailable</T3>, concerning subprograms1.A. and 3.B.) The hog-related projects under subprogram 2.A. were contractedwith private individuals or farmers, and do not involve research.Because projects under subprogram 2.A. are limited to Quebec, we determinethat the federal government's contribution is limited to enterprises orindustries located in a specific region of Canada and is therefore countervailable.Because we verified that projects in subprogram 2.A. involve a large numberand a wide variety of agricultural products, we determine that the provincialgovernment's contribution is not limited to a specific enterprise or industry,or group of enterprises or industries, and is therefore not countervailable.To calculate the benefit, we summed the grants provided to hog-relatedprojects under subprogram 2.A. during the review period and multipliedthis sum by one-half to factor out the Government of Quebec contribution.We divided the result by the dressed-weight equivalent of hogs marketedin the five provinces during the review period to obtain an estimated netsubsidy of Can$0.000019/kg. (Can$0.000009/lb.) for fresh, chilled, andfrozen pork and for sow and boar meat.<ITAG tagnum="81">C. Provincial Programs</ITAG>1. <T3>Alberta Crow Benefit Offset Program</T3>. The purpose of this program,which is administered by Agriculture Alberta, is to eliminate market distortionsin feed grain prices created by the federal government's policy on graintransportation.Assistance is provided on feed grain produced in Alberta, feed grain producedoutside Alberta but sold in Alberta, and feed grain produced in Albertato be fed to livestock on the same farm. The government provides certificatesto registered feed grain users and registered feed grain merchants, whichcan be used as partial payments for grains purchased from grain producers.Feed grain producers who feed their own grain to their own livestock submita claim directly to the government for payment.Hog producers receive benefits in one of three ways. Hog producers whodo not grow any of their own feed grain receive certificates which areused to cover part of the cost of purchasing grain. Hog producers who growall of their own grain submit a claim to the Government of Alberta fordirect payment. Finally, hog producers who grow part of their own grainbut who also purchase grain receive both certificates and direct payments.Because this program is limited to feed grain users, we determine thatit is limited to a specific enterprise or industry, or group of enterprisesor industries, and is therefore, countervailable.Since we do not have precise data on hog consumption of feed grain, asbest information available, we are using data published in <T3>Agriculture in Alberta</T3>, which states that hogs consumed 15 percentof the province's barley production and that barley is the primary grainfed to hogs. Therefore, to calculate the benefit, we allocated 15 percentof the total amount of benefits to feed grain users in Alberta over thedressed-weight equivalent of hogs marketed during the review period inthe five provinces. On this basis, we calculated an estimated net subsidyof Can$0.003228/kg. (Can$0.001464/lb.) for fresh, chilled, and frozen pork,and for sow and boar meat.2. <T3>Alberta Department of Economic Development and Trade Act. </T3>Thepurpose of this program is to foster economic development in the province.Assistance may be provided in the form of grants, loans, or loan guarantees.However, only loans and loan guarantees have been provided under the program.Loans and loan guarantees are only provided to firms which cannot receivefinancing or equivalent financing from commercial sources. Two pork producersin Alberta have received benefits under this program. Gainers Inc. hasreceived both a loan and a loan guarantee from the province under thisprogram, and Fletcher's Fine Foods has received a loan guarantee.In order to determine whether a domestic program confers a countervailablesubsidy, we must determine whether the benefits provided under the programare limited to a specific enterprise or industry, or group of enterprisesor industries, in accordance with section 771(5)(B) of the Act. We typicallyconsider three factors when making this determination: (1) The extent towhich a foreign government acts (as demonstrated in the language of therelevant enacting legislation and implementing regulations) to limit theavailability of a program; (2) the number of enterprises, industries, orgroups thereof that actually use a program, which may include the examinationof disproportionate or dominant users; and (3) the extent, and manner inwhich, the government exercises discretion in making the program available.(See, <T3>Final Affirmative Countervailing Duty Determination and CountervailingDuty Order: Carbon Steel Wire Rod from Malaysia (Wire Rod), </T3>53 FR13303, April 22, 1988, and the DOC Position to Comment 7.)During verification, we found no standard criteria for either the approvalor rejection of applicants under this program. We were unable to reviewapplications of successful and rejected companies under this program. Wewere also unable to determine why certain companies were approved for eithera loan or a loan guarantee, including both pork packers under investigationin Alberta. Provincial officials were unable to provide us with a listof rejected companies. They were also unable to determine the number ofcompanies that have applied for benefits under this program. In addition,we noted that there was no formal or standard application process.Since we were unable to review the documents necessary to make an adequateevaluation of two of the three factors cited above, as best informationavailable, we determine that the program is limited to a specific enterpriseor industry, or group of enterprises or industries. In making this determination,we note that, of the amount of loans granted under this program from itsinception in 1986 through March 1989, approximately 75 percent went toGainers. Also, in any given year there were only a limited number of loanguarantees provided.We determine this program to be countervailable because the terms of theloan and loan guarantees are inconsistent with commercial considerations.During the review period, two loan guarantees and one loan were providedto pork packers. In considering the guaranteed loans, we assumed that thepackers would not have received loans at the interest rates provided withoutthese guarantees because this program is available only to companies thatcould not otherwise receive financing. In addition, we found that loanguarantees are not provided as a normal banking practice in Alberta.One loan guarantee was used to obtain a short-term interim loan. Therefore,to calculate the benefit from this loan, we used our standard short-termloan methodology, comparing the interest rate on this guaranteed loan toa benchmark rate for non-guaranteed loans. No guarantee fee was paid onthis loan during the review period; therefore, we did not deduct a guaranteefee from the net benefit.The other loan guarantee was used to obtain a long-term loan, and we thereforeused our standard long-term loan methodology. We used as our benchmarkthe average long-term corporate bond rate during the review period. Tothat, we added our standard risk premium to reflect the fact that thisprogram is available only to uncreditworthy companies. We considered asthe principal of this loan only the amount attributable to pork operations.Because the firm paid part of the guarantee fee during the review period,we subtracted that portion of the fee attributable to the loan for porkoperations from the net benefit.We followed the same methodology for the one loan provided under this programwithout a guarantee, except that no guarantee fee was subtracted from thebenefit.We then totalled the net benefits from this program and divided the resultby the dressed-weight equivalent of hogs marketed in the five provincesduring the review period to yield an estimated net subsidy of Can$0.000018/kg.(Can$0.000008/lb.) for fresh, chilled, and frozen pork and for sow andboar meat.3. <T3>Alberta Grant to Fletcher's Fine Foods. </T3>During verification wefound that Fletcher's Fine Foods had received a grant from the provinceof Alberta. Company officials stated that the grant was received priorto the review period, but no supporting documentation was provided. Theywere unable to tell us under which program this grant was provided.The grant from the province of Alberta is limited specifically to Fletcher's,and is therefore countervailable. Because we were unable to verify thatthis grant was provided prior to the review period, as best informationavailable, we are attributing the full amount of the grant to the reviewperiod. We divided this grant by the dressed-weight equivalent of hogsmarketed in the five provinces during the review period to yield an estimatednet subsidy of Can$0.000066/kg. (Can$0.000030/lb.) for fresh, chilled,and frozen pork and for sow and boar meat.4. <T3>Ontario Farm Tax Rebate Program. </T3>The Ontario Farm Tax Rebate Programreplaced the Ontario Farm Tax Reduction Program. While the Ontario FarmTax Reduction Program provided a rebate of 60 percent of total propertytaxes levied on eligible farm properties, the current program providesa rebate of 100 percent of taxes levied on outbuildings and propertiesonly. Taxes levied on the residence and one acre of land are no longerrebated.Any resident of Ontario may receive a rebate if he or she owns and paystaxes on eligible properties. Eligible properties are farming enterprisesthat produce farm products with a gross value of at least Can$8,000 insouthern and western Ontario and Can$5,000 in northern and eastern Ontario.We determine that this program is limited to enterprises or industrieslocated in a specific region within the province, and is thus countervailable.However, since all farmers in Ontario whose gross output is at least Can$8,000are eligible to receive a rebate under this program, the program is countervailableonly to the extent that farmers in northern and eastern Ontario whose grossoutput is between Can$5,000-8,000 receive benefits. Based on data taken from the <T3>1986 Census of Agriculture, Statistics Canada,</T3> the last year forwhich complete information is available, the Government of Ontario estimatedthat 4.7 percent of all Ontario swine farmers have sales valued withinthe Can$5,000-8,000 range. To calculate the benefit, we therefore multipliedthe total amount paid to swine producers in eastern and northern Ontarioduring the review period by 4.7 percent. We divided the result by the dressed-weightequivalent of hogs marketed in the five provinces during the review periodto obtain an estimated net subsidy of Can$0.000020/kg. (Can$0.000009/lb.)for both fresh, chilled, and frozen pork and for sow and boar meat. 5. <T3>Ontario (Northern) Livestock Improvement and Transportation AssistancePrograms.</T3> The purpose of these programs is to assist livestock producersin northern Ontario by reducing their relatively high costs of maintainingand improving herd quality. Livestock producers in northern Ontario arereimbursed up to 20 percent of the cost of purchasing breeding stock and50 percent of the transportation cost associated with the purchase of suchbreeding stock.Because these programs are limited to livestock producers in northern Ontario,we determine that they are limited to a specific enterprise or industry,or group of enterprises or industries, and therefore countervailable.To calculate the benefit to swine producers, we allocated the reimbursementsmade to swine producers during the review period over the dressed-weightequivalent of hogs marketed in the five provinces during the review periodto obtain an estimated net subsidy of less than Can$0.000001 in eitherkilograms or pounds for fresh, chilled, and frozen pork and for sow andboar meat.6.<T3> Ontario Pork Industry Improvement Plan (OPIIP).</T3> The purpose ofthis program is to foster excellence in farm business management and theadoption of improved production technologies. Assistance is provided undera number of subprograms. To be eligible for any of the subprograms, a producermust have at least 20 sow equivalents (one sow equivalent is equal to onesow or 15 market-weight hogs marketed annually) and must submit the requiredproduction records.Grants are provided to hog producers under the following subprograms: SwineProduction Analysis, Enterprise Analysis, Swine Ventilation, Productivityand Quality Improvement, Artificial Insemination, Rodent Control, PrivateVeterinary Herd Health, Education, Feed Analysis and Herd Health Improvement.In addition to the above subprograms, there are three other subprogramsunder OPIIP. One provides grants to the Ontario Swine Artificial InseminationAssociation, a farmer cooperative organized for the purpose of developingswine semen production facilities. This Association is the only licensedproducer of swine semen in the province. The other two subprograms providegrants to support (1) research projects related to swine production and(2) local chapters of the Ontario Pork Producers' Marketing Board. (Foradditional information on these last two subprograms, see Section II ofthe notice, <T3>Programs Determined to be Not Countervailable.</T3>)Because the OPIIP provides grants under the remaining subprograms onlyto swine producers, we determine that these remaining subprograms are limitedto a specific enterprise or industry, or group of enterprises or industries,and are therefore, countervailable. To calculate the benefit, we summed the grants provided under these subprogramsduring the review period and divided the result by the dressed-weight equivalentof hogs marketed in the five provinces during the review period to obtainan estimated net subsidy of Can$0.002324/kg. (Can$0.001054/lb.) for fresh,chilled, and frozen pork and for sow and boar meat. 7.<T3> Ontario Marketing Assistance Program for Pork (MAPP).</T3> This program,instituted in 1986, assists Ontario port processors in their efforts toimprove domestic market prospects for pork sales and to sustain and enhancetheir ability to compete in global pork markets. Pork processors receivegrants of 25 percent of the total cost of plant upgrading, new technologyadoption or new product development. Because this program provides grants to only pork processors, we determinethat it is limited to a specific enterprise or industry, or group of enterprisesor industries, and is therefore, countervailable. A consumer survey was also financed under MAPP. For additional informationon that project, see Section II of this notice, <T3>Programs Determined to Be Not Countervailable. </T3>In addition, therewas an export promotion subprogram which was not used during the reviewperiod. To calculate the benefit, we summed the grants provided under this programduring the review period and divided the result by the dressed-weight equivalentof hogs marketed in the five provinces during the review period to obtainan estimated net subsidy of Can$0.000613/kg. (Can$0.000278/lb.) for fresh,chilled, and frozen pork and for sow and boar meat.8. <T3>Quebec Farm Income Stabilization Insurance Program.</T3> This programwas started in 1976 to guarantee a net annual income to participating producers.It is administered by the Regie des Assurances Agricoles du Quebec (theRegie). The program covers calves, feeder cattle, potatoes, piglets, feederhogs, corn, oats, wheat, barley, heavy veal, and sheep. There are no establishedcriteria and no authorization for designating additional commodities tobe covered. To be eligible for the piglet or feeder hog programs, a producermust own the hogs or sows he insures, be personally involved in raisingthe hogs or piglets, own at least 300 insurable hogs or 15 insurable sows,and enroll in the scheme for at least five years. The coverage year runsfrom April 1 to March 31, for the feeder hog program, and runs from July1 to June 30 for the piglet program.The support level is calculated according to a cost of production modelthat includes an adjustment for the difference between the average wageof farm workers and the average wage of all other workers in Quebec. Paymentsto growers are calculated on a yearly basis and are made at the end ofthe coverage year. The program is funded two-thirds by the provincial governmentand one-third by producer assessments. Producer and government contributionsare made once a year and are kept in one account from which all disbursementsare made. Pursuant to an amendment of July 13, 1988, producer assessmentsand the stabilized net annual income are set according to the size of production,effective in the 1988-89 coverage years. Payments received from anothersource, <T3>e.g.,</T3> under a tripartite agreement, are deducted from any stabilizationpayments made by the Regie. Since several major agricultural commodities, such as eggs, dairy products,and poultry, are not covered under this program, we determine that it islimited to a specific enterprise or industry, or group of enterprises orindustries, and is therefore countervailable. We calculated the benefit by multiplying the total amount of stabilizationpayments made under the piglet and feeder hog programs during the reviewperiod by two-thirds to factor out producer assessments. We then dividedthe result by the dressed-weight equivalent of hogs marketed in the fiveprovinces during the review period (less sows and boars) to obtain an estimatednet subsidy of Can$0.043170/kg. (Can$0.019582/lb.) for fresh, chilled andfrozen pork. Because sows and boars slaughtered for meat are ineligiblefor benefits under this program, we determine the benefit to be zero forsow and boar meat.9. <T3>Quebec Productivity Improvement and Consolidation of Livestock ProductionProgram (Farm Building Improvements Subprogram).</T3> This program wasstarted in 1987 and is designed to aid small producers. It is divided intoeight subprograms. Swine growers are only eligible for one subprogram,the Farm Building Improvements Subprogram. With regard to hogs, this subprogramprovides grants to consolidate production so that the process from farrowingto finishing takes place on the same farm. The grants cover up to 30 percentof the actual cost of the conversion. To be eligible for assistance, applicants must be recognized farm producersaccording to the Farm Producer's Act and be registered with the Bureaude Renseignements Agricoles. Producers operating farrowing facilities mustmaintain between 40 and 80 sows, and finishing farms must maintain between500 and 1,000 hogs. The maximum assistance is Can$200 per sow and Can$25per hog, with a maximum of Can$15,000 per farm operation for the durationof the program.Because this subprogram is limited to livestock producers, we determinethat it is limited to a specific enterprise or industry, or group of enterprisesor industries, and is therefore countervailable. To calculate the benefit, we summed the grants provided under this programduring the review period and divided the result by the dressed-weight equivalentof hogs marketed in the five provinces during the review period to obtainan estimated net subsidy of Can$0.000010/kg. (Can$0.000005/lb.) for fresh,chilled, and frozen pork and for sow and boar meat. 10. <T3>Quebec Regional Development Assistance Program (Livestock TransportationSubprogram).</T3> This program was started in 1987 to promote regionaldevelopment in Quebec. The program consists of four subprograms, only oneof which, the Livestock Transportation Subprogram, is available to hogproducers. This subprogram provides financial assistance to eligible producersfor transporting animals to a government inspected slaughterhouse. Quebecis divided into twelve agricultural regions, only five of which (threefull regions and parts of two others) are eligible for aid under the subprogram.These five regions are divided into seven zones based on the distance fromthe Montreal-Quebec triangle, where most of the slaughterhouses are located.The assistance offered varies according to the zone in which the applicant'soperation is located. Because this subprogram is limited to livestock producers in specific regionsof Quebec, we determine that it is limited to a specific group of enterprisesor industries located in a specific region within the province, and istherefore countervailable. To calculate the benefit, we divided the amount of payments made to hogproducers during the review period by the dressed-weight equivalent ofhogs marketed in the five provinces during the review period to obtainan estimated net subsidy of Can$0.000025/kg. (Can$0.000011/lb.) for fresh,chilled, and frozen pork and for sow and boar meat. 11. <T3>Saskatchewan Hog Assured Returns Program (SHARP).</T3> SHARP was establishedin 1976 pursuant to the Saskatchewan Agricultural Returns StabilizationAct. SHARP provides stabilization payments to Saskatchewan hog producerswhen market returns fall below a designated ``floor price.'' The programis administered by the Saskatchewan Pork Producers' Marketing Board onbehalf of the provincial Department of Agriculture. Under the SaskatchewanAgricultural Returns Act, the provincial government may establish a stabilizationplan for any agricultural commodity. However, in practice, only hogs andcattle have such plans. To be eligible, a producer must own market hogs raised and finished toslaughter weight on the production unit or purchased as weanlings or feederhogs and fed a minimum of 60 days. Coverage is limited to 1,500 hogs perproducer per quarter. The program is funded by producer premiums and matching funds from theprovincial government. When Saskatchewan joined the tripartite agreementon hogs effective January 1, 1986, SHARP payments were reduced by the amountof payments received through the tripartite program. No producers havebeen eligible to join SHARP since December 31, 1985. SHARP payments arebeing phased out and will be terminated by March 31, 1991.Stabilization payments are based on the sum of the producer's cash costsplus 75 percent of the sum of non-cash costs for each quarter. Paymentsare made approximately four weeks after the end of each quarter. Unlikethe tripartite program, under which all producers of a commodity receivethe same payment per unit of that commodity, each producer under SHARPis paid the difference between his average market price and the supportprice. Although the Saskatchewan Agricultural Returns Act allows the provincialgovernment to establish stabilization plans for any agricultural commodity, in practice, only hog and cattle producers have such plans. Because stabilizationpayments under this program are limited to only hogs and cattle, we determinethat the program is limited to a specific group of enterprises or industries,and therefore countervailable. To calculate the benefit, we multiplied the total amount of stabilizationpayments made to hog producers during the review period by one-half tofactor out producer premiums. We then divided the result by the dressed-weightequivalent of hogs marketed in the five provinces during the review period(less sows and boars) to obtain an estimated net subsidy of Can$0.001408/kg.(Can$0.000639/lb.) for fresh, chilled, and frozen pork. The estimated netsubsidy is zero for sow and boar meat because sows and boars are ineligiblefor benefits under this program. 12. <T3>Saskatchewan Livestock Investment Tax Credit Program. </T3>The SaskatchewanLivestock Investment Tax Credit Program was introduced in March 1984, underthe Saskatchewan Livestock Investment Tax Credit Act. The program is administeredby the Economics Branch of Saskatchewan Agriculture. It provides incentivesfor the finishing of livestock in Saskatchewan. The program provides atax credit on a per head basis for feeder cattle, hogs and lambs sold forslaughter. Dairy cows, hogs and lambs used for breeding purposes do notqualify for assistance. Poultry is also not eligible for tax credit underthis program. To be eligible for a tax credit, hogs must index 80 or above and be ownedby a resident of Saskatchewan for at least 60 days. (This qualificationautomatically excludes sows and boars.) There is a credit of $3.00 perhog and a $100 deductible per claimant per year. Any unused portion ofthe tax credit can be carried forward for seven years and applied to provincialtax payable. Because this program is limited to livestock producers, we determine thatit is limited to a specific enterprise or industry, or group of enterprisesor industries, and is therefore countervailable. To calculate the benefit, we divided the tax credits net of deductiblesclaimed by swine producers during the review period by the dressed-weightequivalent of hogs marketed in the five provinces during the review period(less sows and boars) to obtain an estimated net subsidy of Can$0.000721/kg.(Can$0.000327/lb.) for fresh, chilled, and frozen pork. The estimated netbenefit is zero for sow and boar meat because sows and boars are ineligiblefor benefits under this program. 13. <T3>Saskatchewan Livestock Facilities Tax Credit Program. </T3>This program,implemented on January l, 1986, provides tax credits to livestock producersfor investment in livestock production facilities. The credit may onlybe used to offset provincial taxes and applications for tax credits mustbe received by Saskatchewan Agriculture no later than six months afterthe project is completed. Unlike the Investment Tax Credit Program, livestock covered under thisprogram can be raised for either breeding or slaughter. Eligible livestockinclude cattle, horses, sheep, swine, goats, poultry, bees, fur-bearinganimals raised in captivity, or any other designated animals. Investmentscovered under the program include new buildings, improvements to existinglivestock facilities and any stationary equipment related to livestockfacilities. The program pays 15 percent of 95 percent of project costs, or 14.25 percentof total costs, in order not to overlap the Business Investment Tax CreditProgram, a federal program. As with the Livestock Investment Tax CreditProgram, participants may carry forward any unused credit for up to sevenyears. Because this program is limited to livestock producers, we determine thatit is limited to a specific enterprise or industry, or group of enterprisesor industries, and is therefore countervailable. To calculate the benefit, we divided the total tax credits claimed by hogproducers by the dressed-weight equivalent of hogs marketed in the fiveprovinces during the review period to obtain an estimated net subsidy ofCan$0.000355/kg. (Can$0.000161/lb.) for fresh, chilled, and frozen porkand for sow and boar meat. II. Programs Determined To Be Not Countervailable 1. <T3>Special Canada Grains Program. </T3>The Special Canada Grains Program1987 Extension provides grants to grain, oilseed, special crop and honeyproducers who have experienced dramatic drops in income due to internationalagricultural policies. To be eligible, farmers must have seeded acreagein Canada of eligible crops harvested in 1987 or have seeded acreage whichwas cut for silage, greenfeed, ploughed down, or left for summerfallowdue to a natural disaster. Eligible crops include wheat, oats, barley,mixed grains, rye, corn, and high moisture grains which are intended tobe harvested as grains or fed to livestock. Because this program is based on seeded acreage of eligible crops, we determinethat it does not provide a countervailable benefit with respect to theproduction or exportation of pork. To determine whether this program providesa benefit to hog producers, it would be necessary to conduct an upstreamsubsidy investigation. However, petitioner did not make a sufficient upstreamsubsidy allegation, and we therefore did not undertake such an investigation.This program is distinguished from the Feed Freight Assistance Program(FFA), which we did find countervailable. Under the FFA, the benefit wasprovided directly to the hog producer for the purpose of purchasing feed.Under the Special Canada Grains Program, payment is made to a grain farmerbased on his grain production.2. <T3>Research Projects under the Canada/Quebec Subsidiary Agreement on Agri-FoodDevelopment. </T3>At verification, we examined three subprograms underthe Subsidiary Agreement, 1.A., 2.A. and 3.B., which include hog-relatedprojects. Of these projects, those under subprogram 1.A. were contractedwith universities or research institutions, and those under 3.B. were contractedwith a consulting firm. We verified that the research results of projectsunder these two subprograms are made available to the public, includingproducers of fresh, chilled, and frozen pork in the United States. Therefore,we determine that projects under subprograms 1.A. and 3.B. are not limitedto a specific enterprise or industry, or group of enterprises or industries,and are thus not countervailable. Subprogram 2.A. is discussed under SectionI of the notice, <T3>Programs Determined to be Countervailable. </T3>3. <T3>Research Projects under the Canada/Saskatchewan Agricultural DevelopmentSubsidiary Agreement. </T3>Under the Canada/Saskatchewan Agricultural DevelopmentSubsidiary Agreement, pursuant to the ERDA between the federal governmentand the Province of Saskatchewan, a variety of research projects are funded.These projects involve crops, livestock, soil, irrigation, and human resources.The livestock projects include a number of hog/pork-related projects, includingthe Swine Herd Technology Transfer Program. Some projects are 100 percentfunded by the federal government, while others are 100 percent funded bythe provincial government. In the end, however, dollar amounts for allprojects work out to be split 50/50 between federal/provincial financing.We verified that the research results of projects related to hogs or porkfunded under the Subsidiary Agreement are made available to the public,including producers of fresh, chilled, and frozen pork in the United States.Therefore, we determine that projects under the Subsidiary Agreement arenot limited to a specific enterprise or industry, or group of enterprisesor industries, and are thus not countervailable. 4. <T3>Alberta Processed Food Market Expansion Program. </T3>This programpromoted consumer awareness of Alberta products throughout the province.The promotion was for all agricultural products produced in Alberta. Becausethis promotion is designed to increase domestic awareness, and thereforeis tied to the sale of products to a market other than the United States,we determine that it does not provide a countervailable benefit to theproduction or exportation of fresh, chilled, and frozen pork. 5. <T3>Alberta Food Processors' Promotion Assistance Program. </T3>This programreplaced the Processed Food Market Expansion Program. The objective ofthe program is to promote Alberta agricultural products within Alberta.Because this promotion is designed to increase domestic awareness, andtherefore is tied to the sale of products to a market other than the UnitedStates, we determine that it does not provide a countervailable benefitto the production or exportation of fresh, chilled, and frozen pork. 6. <T3>MAPP Consumer Survey. </T3>The Ontario Ministry of Agriculture andFood commissioned a survey on U.S. consumer attitudes toward pork. Thecost of the survey was Can$250,000 and was financed under MAPP. The resultsof the survey are publicly available both inside and outside of Canada.Therefore, we determine that the benefits from this project are not limitedto a specific enterprise or industry, or group of enterprises or industries,and are thus not countervailable. 7. <T3>Research Grants under the OPIIP. </T3>Research grants under OPIIP areprovided to support research projects related to swine production. We verifiedthat the results of such research are publicly available both inside andoutside Canada. Therefore, we determine that the benefits of such researchgrants are not limited to a specific enterprise or industry, or group ofenterprises or industries, and are thus not countervailable. 8. <T3>Education Grants to the Ontario Pork Producers' Marketing Board underthe OPIIP. </T3>Grants are given to local chapters of the Marketing Boardto help defray the costs of general agricultural education programs. Theamount of the grants is determined by the membership of the organization.Because these grants are paid to the marketing boards for agriculturaleducation programs, we determine that there is no countervailable benefitto the production or exportation of pork.9. <T3>Grants to the Pork Producers' Marketing Boards.</T3> During verificationwe found that some marketing boards had received funds from the provincialgovernments to defray the cost of pork promotion campaigns. Because thesepromotions were designed to increase domestic consumption, and thereforewere tied to the sale of products to a market other than the United States,we determine that they do not provide a countervailable benefit to theproduction or exportation of fresh, chilled, and frozen pork.III. Programs Determined Not To Be UsedWe determine that the following programs were not used by producers orexporters in Canada of fresh, chilled, and frozen pork during the reviewperiod:1. <T3>Export Expansion Fund. </T3>This fund covers the costs of federal governmenttravel to foreign countries for trade consultations or technical seminars.The fund also brings foreign officials to Canada. No funds were used tofinance travel related to the exportation of pork to the United Statesduring the review period.2. <T3>Canada/Alberta Subsidiary Agreement on Agricultural Processing andMarketing. </T3>This subsidiary agreement operates under the ERDA betweenthe Government of Alberta and the Government of Canada, which became effectiveJune 8, 1984. The agreement is jointly funded and administered by the federaland the provincial government. The purpose of the agreement is to enhancethe agricultural processing sector of Alberta's economy.Applicants who carry out approved projects within the agricultural processingsector receive non-repayable contributions toward eligible costs incurred.Eligible projects include the establishment, expansion, and modernizationof processing operations and testing and research facilities, as well asfeasibility studies and product research and development.We verified that no assistance was provided to federally-inspected porkproducers (the only pork producers eligible to export) during the reviewperiod. 3.<T3> Canada/Alberta Livestock Drought Assistance Program.</T3> This programprovided relief to livestock producers in certain areas affected by drought.The program was jointly funded by the provincial and federal governments.Eligible livestock included beef cattle, dairy cattle, bison, sheep, goatsand horses. Hog producers were not eligible for benefits under this program.4. <T3>Alberta Livestock Assistance Program.</T3> This program provided assistanceto livestock producers living in areas not covered by the joint federal-provincialdrought program. Livestock eligible for this program were the same as forthe joint program. Hog producers were not eligible for assistance underthis program.5. <T3>Alberta Red Meat Stabilization Program.</T3> This interim program providedassistance to livestock producers before the tripartite agreements weresigned. We verified that no assistance was provided to hog or pork producersduring the review period, as all payments were made during 1985.6. <T3>Alberta Grants to Pork Producers.</T3> The province of Alberta agreedto provide funds to two pork producers in the province under the same termsand conditions as the Canada Alberta Subsidiary Agreement on AgriculturalProcessing and Marketing. However, the grants are to be fully funded bythe province. We verified that no funds were disbursed during the reviewperiod.7. <T3>Manitoba Development Corporation. </T3>During verification, we discoveredthat East-West Packers received a forgiveable loan from the Manitoba DevelopmentCorporation. We requested additional information on the Manitoba DevelopmentCorporation but none was submitted. However, using our methodology, theforgiveable loan was received too late to have provided a benefit to thecompany during the review period.8. <T3>Manitoba Hog Income Stabilization Program.</T3> This program providedincome support payments to hog producers when the market price for hogsfell below an established price support level. It was funded by premiumsfrom participating producers and from the provincial government. This programwas terminated effective June 28, 1986. We verified that no assistancewas provided to hog producers during the review period, as the last payoutunder this program was made in July 1986. 9. <T3>Ontario Export Sales Aid.</T3> This program assists agriculture andfood producers and processors in developing markets abroad by providingfinancial and technical support for various promotional activities. Weverified that no assistance was provided to hog or pork producers duringthe review period. 10. <T3>Ontario Small Food Processors Assistance Program. </T3>This programassists eligible small food processing companies by improving their accessto market information, strengthening their business planning skills andcapabilities, and providing financial assistance on eligible capital investments.We verified that no assistance was provided to hog or pork producers duringthe review period. 11. <T3>Quebec Meat Sector Rationalization Program.</T3> Under this program,the Ministry of Agriculture assumed part of the eligible capital costsof investments for the establishment, standardization, expansion, modernizationor amalgamation of slaughterhouses and meat processing plants. The programstarted in 1975 with a three-year mandate, after which it was renewed fourtimes for one year at a time. The program officially terminated in 1982,with financial assistance granted until 1984. We verified that there wereno benefits to slaughterhouses or pork packers under this program duringthe review period. Comments All written comments submitted by the interested parties in this investigationwhich have not been previously addressed in this notice are addressed below.<T3>Comment 1.</T3> Respondents assert that the application of section771B in this investigation is inconsistent with U.S. obligations underthe General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) which states that a signatorycannot impose a duty in excess of the subsidy. Respondents maintain thatunless it can be shown that benefits completely pass through from the producersof the raw agricultural product to the processors of that product, thecountervailing duty on the procesed product may be greater than the actualsubsidy to the producers of the processed product. Petitioner argues that the application of section 771B is not a violationof the GATT because the type of analysis contained in that section hasbeen used in several previous agricultural cases where a ``pass through''analysis was deemed inappropriate. According to petitioner, in cases involvingagricultural products which are closely related, such as hogs and pork,any subsidy paid on the raw product is itself paid on the initially processedproduct. Moreover, petitioner claims that the government of Canada hasapplied a similar analysis in a countervailing duty investigation involvingboneless beef from the European Economic Community. Petitioner contendsthat in that investigation the Canadians considered benefits to cattleproducers as direct benefits to producers of boneless beef. <T3>DOC Position. </T3>Section 771B is consistent with Article VI(3) ofthe GATT. Article VI(3) of the GATT holds, in part, ``No countervailingduty shall be levied on any product * * * in excess of an amount equalto the estimated bounty or subsidy determined to have been granted, directlyor indirectly, on the manufacture, production or export of such productin the country of origin or exportation * * *'' First, section 771B simplyrecognizes that, due to the nature of the market for certain agriculturalproducts, the subsidy on such products is deemed to be provided directlyto the manufacture, production, or exportation of the processed product.See <T3>Application of Section 771B. </T3>Second, section 771B does not inflatethe subsidy given on the raw or processed product. In fact, to accuratelymeasure the subsidy, we used a conversion factor to calculate the percentageof pork yield from live swine. For these reasons, section 771B remainsconsistent with the GATT. <T3>Comment 2. </T3>Respondents contend that section 771B supersedes anyprior administrative practice regarding raw and processed agriculturalproducts. Respondents argue that the Department's practice in such caseswas not consistent and consequently could not be considered to be codifiedin section 771B. <T3>DOC Position.</T3> The criteria codified in section 771B are the samecriteria used in <T3>Swine. </T3>In fact, as the legislative history clearly shows, Congresspassed this amendment in order to codify the Department,s practice in pastinvestigations regarding agricultural products, particularly the <T3>Swine </T3>investigation. For these reasons, we consider previous finaland preliminary determinations that discussed these past practices to berelevant to this investigation. <T3>Comment 3.</T3> Petitioner argues that the Department's determinationthat 20 percent value added was not limited in <T3>Initiation of Countervailing Duty Investigation: Certain Table Winefrom France </T3>(50 FR 40480, October 4, 1985) (<T3>Table Wine</T3>), is not relevant to this case because, unlike hogs,grapes have several other end uses. Petitioner argues that the value addedthreshold for a product with multiple alternative retail uses is not necessarilythe same as for a product dedicated to a single end use. Respondents argue that the Department should find the 20 percent valueadded by pork packers to be more than limited, as it found in the initiationnotice for <T3>Table Wine. </T3>Respondents argue that in <T3>Table Wine </T3>the Department refused to consider benefits to grapegrowers as benefits to wine producers because the value added by wine producerswas at least 20 percent. <T3>DOC Position.</T3> We have determined that, in this investigation,it is reasonable to consider the 20 percent added by pork producers tolive swine to be limited value, as the term is defined under section 771B.Because we never reached a preliminary or final determination followingthe initiation of <T3>Table Wine, </T3>the initiation notice for that investigation carriesno precedential weight. <T3>Comment 4.</T3> Petitioner contends that the Alberta Crow Benefit OffsetProgram is countervailable because it provides direct benefits to livestockproducers who use either farm-fed or purchased grains. Respondents assert that the Alberta Crow Benefit Offset Program is notcountervailable because the program only partially offsets the disadvantageto grain users created by the federal Crow Benefit Program. Respondentsargue that it is consistent with Department practice to find such offsettingprograms not countervailable when there is no gross subsidy to the producer.Respondents cite the <T3>Final Affirmative Countervailing Duty Determinations: Certain SteelProducts from the Federal Republic of Germany </T3>(47 FR 39345, September7, 1982) (<T3>FRG Steel</T3>), and the <T3>Final Affirmative Countervailing Duty Determinations: Certain SteelProducts from Belgium </T3>(47 FR 39304, September 7, 1982) (<T3>Belgium Steel</T3>), as examples of cases involving offsetting programswhich were found not countervailable. In addition, respondents claim thatif there is any benefit to hog producers, that benefit goes to an input,grain, and therefore an upstream subsidy investigation is required. Sinceno upstream investigation has been carried out, respondents contend thatany possible benefit to hog producers cannot be measured. <T3>DOC Position.</T3> Unlike the Special Canada Grains Program, this programis not tied to grain production; it is limited to feed grain users andmerchants. Therefore, we have determined that it is countervailable. The fact that a program is designed to offset the economic effects of anothergovernment program or policy does not exempt it from investigation underthe countervailing duty law. For example, programs designed to exempt certaincompanies from income taxes in order to offset the effect of an extremelyhigh national income tax policy are still potentially countervailable.In order to be considered an offset, the criteria of the offset provisionsof section 771(6) of the Act must be met. Clearly, these provisions werenot met here.We reject respondents' claim that this program is analogous to <T3>FRG Steel. </T3>In that investigation, the German Government choseto impose an import ban on coal and to subsidize coal production. We foundno countervailable benefit to steel producers resulting from the coal subsidybecause the price that steel producers were paying for coal was higherthan the world price. Since the<T3> FRG Steel </T3>determination, we have adopted an upstream subsidyanalysis, which would now be applied to determine whether benefits to coalproducers passed through to steel producers. In this investigation, thebenefit is paid directly to grain users and not to grain producers. Thus,there is no need to conduct an upstream subsidy analysis.The precedent set in <T3>Belgium Steel</T3> also does not apply to this investigation. In <T3>Belgium Steel</T3>, the government assumed responsibility for fundingthe cost it imposed on the steel companies by mandating early retirementof certain workers. We determined in that case that this assistance wasnot countervailable because it benefitted only the workers and not thesteel companies.<T3>Comment 5.</T3> Petitioner asserts that the Department should determinethat at least 50 percent of all benefits under the Alberta Crow BenefitOffset Program are paid to hog producers because hogs account for about50 percent of total feed consumption in both eastern and western Canada.Petitioner contends that the 12 percent figure used in the preliminarydetermination should be rejected because it is based on the relative valueof swine with respect to other livestock and, therefore, is not relevantto the amount of feed grains consumed by hogs.Respondents argue that the Department should not use the 50 percent figurerequested by petitioner because (1) it is unverified, (2) it relates tofeed consumption in western Canada and not Alberta, and (3) it is unclearwhether this 50 percent figure relates to all feed grains or just cornand barley. Moreover, respondents claim that the 12 percent figure usedin the preliminary determination was based on the cash receipts for hogproducers over the cash receipts for all livestock producers. Respondentsargue that it would be more accurate to use the cash receipts for hog producersover cash receipts for all agricultural production because this programbenefits grain producers and not livestock producers. Respondents claimthat the correct percentage of payouts which can be attributed to hog producersis 5.48 percent.<T3>DOC Position.</T3> We have used, as best information available, datacontained in the publication<T3> Agriculture in Alberta,</T3> which stated that hogs accounted for15 percent of the consumption of the province's barley production, andthat barley is the primary grain fed to hogs in Alberta. We consider thisto be the most appropriate measure of the benefits conferred on hog productionunder this program. We have rejected respondents' 5.48 percent figure becausethe relative value of hogs to other agricultural commodities bears no relationshipto the amount of grains fed to hogs. The 15 percent figure published in<T3>Agriculture in Alberta</T3> is the only data we have on the amountof grain consumed by hogs in Alberta and represents the best informationavailable to measure the countervailable benefit under the program.<T3>Comment 6.</T3> Petitioner argues that the full amount of rebates tohog producers under the Ontario Farm Tax Rebate Program should be foundcountervailable because some farmers, namely those with a gross value ofproduction of less than Can$5,000, are ineligible for benefits. Petitionermaintains that in two prior cases, <T3>Final Affirmative Countervailing Duty Determination and CountervailingDuty Order: Lime from Mexico</T3> (49 FR 35672, September 11, 1984) and<T3> Groundfish,</T3> programs which provided higher benefits to certaingroups or classes of producers were found countervailable to the extentthat there was a differential between the most and the least preferredproducer. Since the least preferred producer in this program receives nobenefits, petitioner contends that all benefits to hog producers shouldbe found countervailable.Respondents argue that this program is generally available to all <T3>bona fide</T3> farmers and that only rebates to swine producers innorthern and eastern Canada with a gross value of production between Can$5,000and Can$8,000 are countervailable. Respondents also claim that the programscited by petitioner are not relevant in this investigation because underthose programs, even the least preferred producer was included in the program,whereas those farmers with a gross value of production of less than Can$5,000are not even eligible under this program. Respondents assert that thesefarmers are not eligible because they are not considered to be bona fidefarmers.<T3>DOC Position.</T3> For purposes of this program, the province of Ontariohas defined a bona fide farmer as one with a gross value of productionof at least Can$5,000 a year. We find that definition to be reasonableand one that does not restrict benefits to any specific group within agriculture.However, we do find the program countervailable to the extent that farmersin southern and western Ontario need a gross value of production of Can$8,000to qualify for the program. Our decision is consistent with the cases citedby petitioner. In each of those cases, we only countervailed the differencein the level of benefits based on regional distinction.<T3>Comment 7. </T3>Respondents argue that the Department is not authorizedto examine the process by which benefits are conferred in determining whetherbenefits under the tripartite program are limited to a specific enterpriseor industry or group of enterprises or industries. They state that theCIT has ``never approved * * * the examination of governmental discretionor intent'' in determining whether a program is limited to a specific enterpriseor industry or group of enterprises or industries. They cite <T3>Cabot Corp.</T3> v.<T3> United States,</T3> 620 F. Supp. 722, 730 (1985)(<T3>Cabot I</T3>), in which the Court ruled that the Department ``mustexamine the actual results or effects of assistance provided by foreigngovernments and not the purposes or intentions.''Petitioner counters that the <T3>Cabot I</T3> citation is part of a  larger discussion having nothingto do with the role of intent or discretion, and that ``the passing referenceto intent'' is therefore <T3>dicta.</T3> Petitioner argues that, ``in the absence of any reliableevidence of specific criteria for extending tripartite coverage to givencommodities, the Department must examine discretion and intent in orderto determine how the tripartite schemes, as a group, operate.''<T3>DOC Position. </T3>We typically consider three factors in determiningwhether a program is limited to a specific enterprise or industry or groupof enterprises or industries: (1) The extent to which a foreign governmentacts (as demonstrated in the language of the relevant enacting legislationand implementing regulations) to limit the availability of a program; (2)the number of enterprises, industries, or groups thereof that actuallyuse a program, which may include the examination of disproportionate ordominant users; and (3) the extent, and manner in which, the governmentexcercises discretion in making the program available. With respect tothe third factor, it is our general policy when verifying domestic programsto review the procedures for approving or rejecting applications for benefits.We must examine relevant documents to ensure that a situation does notexist where a program, which based on the statute appears to be availableto all companies in a country, is being administered in a manner that isdistortive. See, for example, <T3>Wire Rod.</T3>At verification, we found no standard criteria for establishing or operatingtripartite agreements. Instead, we found that (1) tripartite agreementsonly exist for nine agricultural commodities; (2) tripartite agreementsdo not exist for all commodities requested by producers; (3) differentlevels of stabilization exist among commodities covered by tripartite agreements,and (4) even among swine producers, benefits are not available on equalterms, due to the fact that Quebec is allowed to maintain its provincialstabilization program while other provincial stabilization programs mustbe phased out. <T3>Comment 8. </T3>Petitioner argues that the benefit from the tripartiteprogram should be calculated on a credits-as-earned basis. Petitioner statesthat this methodology is consistent with the Department,s past practice,and cites <T3>Final Affirmative Countervailing Duty Determination and CountervailingDuty Order: Certain Steel Wire Nails from New Zealand </T3>(52 FR 37196,October 5, 1987), in which benefits under the Export Performance TaxationIncentive (EPTI) program, a New Zealand tax program, were calculated inthis manner because there was ``no uncertainty as to eligibility, no needfor complex tax accounting, and no dependence on ultimate tax liability.''Petitioner asserts that the tripartite program is similar in that thereis ``no uncertainty as to eligibility, no need for complex accounting,and no adjustments for individualized circumstances.'' Petitioner addsthat the credits-as-earned methodology would yield the most accurate cashdeposit rate because it is ``based on market conditions which actuallyexisted during the review period.'' The Canadian Pork Council (CPC) argues that, if the Department does determinethat the tripartite program and provincial stabilization programs are countervailable,the benefits should be based only on government contributions to the stabilizationfund, regardless of payments to producers. It characterizes the tripartiteprogram as an insurance scheme in which ``the actual benefit to producers* * * should be viewed as the income security that is available on a continuingbasis'' which ``should be measured not by the amount of any particularpayment a producer may receive in any given year, but by the funds availablein the `insurance' plan, made up of premiums paid by producers, provincialand Federal governments, and any interest on the accumulated funds.'' TheCPC counters petitioner by stating that this methodology would result in``a more predictable level of countervailable duties from year to year,and avoid significant differences between deposits and assessed duties.''The Canadian Meat Council and Canada Packers, Inc., (CMC and CP) agreewith the CPC but add that if the Department decides not to use the governmentcontribution approach, it should use the credits-as-earned methodologysuggested by petitioner. The CMC and CP qualify this point by arguing thatthe time period used should be fiscal year 1988/89 (April 1, 1988-March31, 1989). They state that the credits-as-earned method and the fiscalyear 1988/89 time period would result in a deposit rate ``that is mostconsistent'' with any final duties which might later be assessed in anadministrative review. <T3>DOC Position. </T3>The Department has consistently used the cash flowmethod in determining when benefits are received. There are two exceptions. One applies to certain situations involving bigticket items, the production and delivery of which may extend over severalyears. In such situations, the application of the cash flow method wouldenable certain countervailable subsidies to go unremedied. <T3>See Final Affirmative Countervailing Duty Determination: Offshore PlatformJackets and Piles from Korea, </T3>51 FR 11779 (1986). This is not thecase with payments under the tripartite program, which would be capturedat the time they are paid out to producers. The second exception involves an export benefit provided as a percentageof the value of the exported merchandise (such as a cash payment or anoverrebate of indirect taxes) on the date of export. This exception isbased on the New Zealand EPTI program cited by petitioner. The EPTI exampleis not applicable here, however, because the recipients of the EPTI paymentsknew at the time they made their export sales what their cash payment wouldbe. By contrast, hog producers enrolled in the tripartite plan for hogsdo not know what cash payments, if any, they will receive until their checksare sent out. Certainty as to the amount to be received does not occurwhen the federal and provincial governments contribute to the stabilizationfund or when hogs are sold. Regarding our use of the cash-flow methodology for determining when benefitsare received, we note that under Article VI(3) of the GATT we are not allowedto countervail more than the actual amount of a subsidy. Our cash-flowmethodology ensures that we do not exaggerate the actual subsidy paid ona product during the period under review. The accrual method suggestedby respondents could lead the Department to finding a subsidy when, infact, pig farmers have received no payments at all or to finding no benefitwhen pig farmers actually received substantial payments. As for the argument made by the CMC and CP that we change our review periodto the Government of Canada's 1988/89 fiscal year, the Department has consistentlyrefused to change the review period in an investigation after the preliminarydetermination. To change the review period after the preliminary determinationwould substantially prejudice the position of all parties to the proceedingby decreasing their ability to comment on our findings. <T3>Comment 9. </T3>Petitioner states that there are discrepancies betweenthe tripartite payouts reported in the March 9, 1989 response and thosereported in a subsequent response. Petitioner argues that the Departmentshould therefore use the higher figures contained in the later response.Respondents state that the Department verified the figures reported inthe March 9 response and that the figures contained in the subsequent responseare hypothetical amounts based on 100 percent participation in the tripartiteprogram, <T3>i.e., </T3>participation of all ten provinces and all federally andprovincially inspected plants and all exports of market hogs, rather thanthe actual amounts paid out under the program. <T3>DOC Position. </T3>We have based our calculations on verified information.<T3>Comment 10. </T3>Respondents argue that we should allocate the benefitsprovided to the production of swine over the entire live weight of swine.Citing <T3>Groundfish, </T3>respondents contend that when analyzing benefits froma domestic subsidy, the Department's practice is to allocate those benefitsover all domestic production. They state that the Department allocatedthe benefit over all fresh fish and shellfish, even though shellfish wasnot under investigation. They also cite <T3>Lamb Meat 1985, </T3>in which the Department allocated the domesticsubsidy over all products produced during the slaughter operation, includingthe meat, pelts, wool and offal. <T3>DOC Position. </T3>Respondents cite <T3>Lamb Meat 1985 </T3>as an instance where the Department allocated thedomestic subsidy over all products produced during the slaughter operation.This case is not relevant to the present investigation, however, as hogsare raised for the sole purpose of producing pork. Lambs, on the otherhand, are raised for two primary purposes, their meat and wool. <T3>Groundfish </T3>also has no relevance to this investigation. In <T3>Groundfish, </T3>the Department did allocate certain program benefitsover fish and shellfish. We did so because benefits under those programswere provided to both fish and shellfish and could not be segregated tothe subject merchandise. <T3>Comment 11. </T3>Petitioner argues that slaughter sows and boars shouldbe excluded from the denominator used to calculate benefits under any programthat does not cover sows and boars. Sows and boars are not eligible underthe tripartite program and were considered a distinct subclass of merchandisein the Department's first administrative review of the countervailing dutyorder on live swine. For that review, the rate for all programs under investigationwas recalculated by deducting 2.1 percent of production to account forsows and boars. Respondents, citing the <T3>Live Swine Review, </T3>also argue that the Department should calculatea separate rate for sows and boars and, in addition, determine which benefitspass through to producers of sow and boar meat. They maintain that if theDepartment does not calculate a separate rate for sows and boars, it willbe determining that benefits from programs for which sows and boars areineligible pass through to sow and boar meat. They maintain that sow andboar meat should not be subjected to any countervailing duty on fresh,chilled, and frozen pork produced from market hogs. They contend that sowand boar meat is distinguishable from market hog meat by its color, weight,and consistency, and that boar meat must be stamped as such. <T3>DOC Position. </T3>We have calculated a separate rate for sows andboars. Sows and boars are not eligible for stabilization under the tripartiteand other subsidy programs. Additionally, sows and boars were considereda distinct subclass of merchandise in the Department's <T3>Live Swine Review. </T3>Following the methodology used in that review,we have deducted 2.1 percent of hog production to account for sows andboars, where appropriate, from our subsidy calculations. <T3>Comment 12. </T3>Respondents contend that the Department's use of totalpork production in the five provinces as the denominator is accurate. Theymaintain that, unlike imports of live swine, pork imports are not identifiedby their province of origin. Additionally, hogs often originate in oneprovince but are exported as pork by another province. For these reasons,respondents state that calculating the countervailing duties using thetrade-weighted approach would be inaccurate. <T3>DOC Position. </T3>We agree. We verified that hogs are often shippedacross provincial boundaries for slaughter and cutting into pork. Therefore,any countervailing duties based on the trade-weighted approach would overstateor understate the level of benefit depending on whether the province isa net importer or exporter of hogs. <ITAG tagnum="84">Verification </ITAG>In accordance with section 776(b) of the Act, except where noted in thisdetermination, we verified the information used in making our final determination.We followed standard verification procedures, including meeting with governmentand company officials, examination of relevant accounting records, andexamination of original source documents. Our verification results areoutlined in detail in the public versions of the verification reports,which are on file in the Central Records Unit (Room B-099) of the MainCommerce Building. <ITAG tagnum="84">Suspension of Liquidation </ITAG>In accordance with section 703(d) of the Act, we instructed the U.S. CustomsService to suspend liquidation of all entries of fresh, chilled, and frozenpork from Canada which is entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption,on or after May 8, 1988, the date of publication of our preliminary determinationin the <T4>Federal Register. </T4>The liquidation of all entries, entered or withdrawnfrom warehouse, for consumption will continue to be suspended, and as ofthe date of publication of this notice in the <T4>Federal Register, </T4>the Customs Service will require a cash depositor bond for all entries of fresh, chilled and frozen pork equal to Can$0.08/kg.(Can$0.036/lb.), and zero for all entries of fresh, chilled, and frozensow and boar meat. <ITAG tagnum="84">ITC Notification </ITAG>In accordance with section 705(d) of the Act, we will notify the ITC ofour determination. In addition, we are making available to the ITC allnon-privileged and non-proprietary information relating to this investigation.We will allow the ITC access to all privileged and business proprietaryinformation in our files, provided the ITC confirms that it will not disclosesuch information, either publicly or under an administrative protectiveorder, without the written consent of the Assistant Secretary for ImportAdministration. If the ITC determines that material injury, or the threat of material injury,does not exist, this proceeding will be terminated and all estimated dutiesdeposited or securities posted as a result of the suspension of liquidationwill be refunded or cancelled. If, however, the ITC determines that suchinjury does exist, we will issue a countervailing duty order, directingCustoms officers to assess countervailing duties on all entries of fresh,chilled, and frozen pork from Canada entered, or withdrawn from warehouse,for consumption, as described in the ``Suspension of Liquidation'' sectionof this notice. This determination is published pursuant to section 705 (d) of the Act[19 U.S.C. 1671d(d)].<ITAG tagnum="6">Eric I.
