Overall heat-transfer coefficients, determinedfrom the average gas temperature for different packed heights, were usedwith expressions for the effective thermal conductivity to calculatewall-film heat-transfer coefficients. The Nusselt number for the wallfilm increased with D/sub p//D/sub t/ as well as with the particle Reynoldsnumber, but the effective thermal conductivity decreased with D/sub p//D/subt/ for a given Reynolds number. These trends led to a fairly broad maximumin the curve of overall coefficient versus D/sub p//D/sub t/, with themaximum shifting to lower values of D/sub p//D/sub t/ at higher flowrates. For the same size packing, the overall coefficients for the differentshapes were nearly the same over a 10-fold range of flow rates.</TEXT></DOC>
