Vernon of the Wyatt Co., a consulting firm that conducted atwo-year national survey on nursing, called ``I Love My Work. IHate My Job.''   Besides higher pay, nurses should have more influence on theirjobs, fewer menial or non-medical tasks, more chances foradvancement, and more scheduling flexibility where possible, thestudy says.   A separate Wyatt study issued in July showed that one in 10hospital-nursing jobs is unfilled, and that one in five registerednurses leave their hospital employ every year, Vernon said.   ``There really is not a shortage of registered nurses in theUnited States,'' said Claudia J. Wyatt, a consultant in Wyatt'sChicago office.   The shortage is of those willing to work in hospitals, she said.   ``Keeping nurses in hospital-based nursing is the keypriority,'' Ms. Wyatt said.   For the two-year study, Wyatt conducted interviews _ somelasting several hours _ with more than 500 people, includinghospital administrators, nursing managers and more than 200 currentor former nurses, Ms. Wyatt said.   The sample of people at 100 hospitals in 10 states was designedto be nationally representative, including nurses with a range ofjobs from hospitals of all sizes, she said.   Spokeswoman Pamela Towne of the Chicago-based Illinois NursesAssociation said the group's parent organization, the AmericanNurses' Association in Kansas City, Mo., issued a set of similarsolutions to the nursing shortage a year ago.   Improved salary and benefits, better working conditions, andhelping part-time nurses return to full employment were among thesuggestions, she said.   According to the Wyatt study, the average staff salary for aregistered nurse in August was $26,000, ranging from a low of$22,800 in the rural Southeast to a high of $30,400 in West Coastsuburbs.   The average starting annual salary for a newly graduatedregistered nurse was $22,300, ranging from a low of $20,400 in arural hospital in the north-central region to a high of $25,500 inthe West Coast suburbs.   The report noted that no relationship was found between salariesat facilities that perceive a nursing shortage and those that donot.   Ms. Towne also said that an increasing demand for nurses, ratherthan nurses giving up hospital work, appeared to be creating theshortage in Illinois, where 100,000 registered nurses work.   She said nationwide, 2 million registered nurses are licensed,and 1.6 million _ the most ever _ are working. Of those, 65 percentto 68 percent work in hospitals, Ms. Towne said.   Ms. Wyatt said giving nurses more say in defining their jobs,and more options concerning shifts and part-time work can pay offfor hospitals.   ``Nurses are true white-collar professionals who love being inthe front line of patient care,'' she said, ``but sometimes theyfeel they get treated like blue-collar workers.''   The survey was conducted at hospitals in Alabama, Florida,Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Illinois, Ohio,Texas and California.</TEXT></DOC>
