The biotechnology company said the trials will be conducted through Biocine Co., a 50-50 joint venture with Ciba-Geigy Ltd. organized last October.    Chiron declined to estimate when the trials could begin or how soon an AIDS vaccine, assuming successful clinical trials, might be available. But the company is already at the forefront of the race to produce genetically engineered vaccines, having last fall received FDA approval of its recombinant hepatitis-B vaccine, which is being produced and marketed in an agreement with Merck andamp; Co., Rahway, N.J. It was the first vaccine produced by gene-splicing to gain FDA marketing clearance.    Biocine was formed to develop and put on the market a line of genetically engineered vaccines against a variety of infectious diseases including AIDS, oral, genital herpes, malaria and several strains of hepatitis. The venture is located in Emeryville.    Chiron is contributing its gene-splicing technology to the venture while Summit, N.J.-based Ciba-Geigy is providing cash and its expertise in developing general immune system boosters. The amount of Ciba-Geigy's cash infusion wasn't disclosed.    Genetically engineered vaccines prevent disease by employing synthetic facsimiles of disease-causing viruses, thus tricking the body's immune system into a protective response. The gene-spliced vaccines are considered safer than those produced from live viruses, which sometimes cause the disease they seek to prevent. </TEXT></DOC>
