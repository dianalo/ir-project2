(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Great Montana Centennial Cattle Drivethundered into Billings just after sunrise today as 2,700 cattle and2,400 riders moved slowly down Main Street in the morning chill.   The sound of hooves and the rumble of the iron-shod wheels of 200covered wagons reverbrated along the three-mile parade route.Thousands of people gathered before dawn to watch the procession,led by a Union cavalry unit and brought up by the mass of cattle.   The herd of largely longhorn cattle swept across the six lanes ofthe parade route, nearly surrounded by the 105 drovers who hadherded them over the plains during the past six days. A few peoplereached out to touch the animals.   The six-day journey, which began at Roundup about 60 miles northof Billings, was to end tonight with a country-western concert.   The drive was part of Montana's centennial celebration and alsocommemorated the great cattle drives of the last century, whichbegan when Nelson Story brought the first herd of Texas longhorns toMontana in 1866.   Billings took extraordinary steps to welcome the sprawlingcaravan.   The U.S. Postal Service suspended mail delivery in north Billingsfor today and all off-duty police officers and street sweepers werecalled in.   Assistant City Administrator John Lawton also urged viewers touse ``extreme caution'' near the herd out of concern of a stampede.   ``No one can predict with certainty how the animals will react,''Lawton said Friday.   Words of caution have been heard for days, but the experiencedwranglers tending the herd managed to head off any major problems onthe trail.   Trail boss Jay Stovall, noting that he and 20 ranch handsroutinely herd 3,000 head of cattle between pastures on his ranch,said having 100 top hands to handle the chore made the task simple.   ``If we had 100 people who didn't know what they were doing, itwould be way too many,'' Stovall said. Experienced hands``anticipate problems before they happen.''   Thousands of Billings residents greeted the travelers Thursday atthe fourth-night camp about 21 miles north of the city _ and createda miles-long traffic snarl.   Cool, gray skies and light rain hung over the drive Fridaymorning as the participants began their last day on the trail, butthe mood was exuberant.   Hundreds of cars, trucks, mobile homes and even buses lined U.S.87 north of Billings on Friday afternoon as spectators again swarmedto watch the arrival of the wagon train and, a couple of milesfarther out, the cattle herd.   The head of the column began to gather at a giantred-and-white-striped ``beer tent.''   Within minutes, Friday night's camp was set.   The cattle were led to a pasture near the highway, and spectatorsclimbed over and through a barbed-wire fence to shake hands with thedrovers.</TEXT></DOC>
