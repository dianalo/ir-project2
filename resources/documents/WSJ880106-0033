FDIC Chairman William Seidman had previously said he was close to agreement with other federal bank regulators to require so-called full opinion audits of banks with assets exceeding a threshold of between $100 million and $150 million. He said it would help regulators and the public monitor bank fraud and mismanagement.    Mr. Seidman said he dropped the idea because he learned that 90% of banks with assets exceeding $100 million already are independently audited, so the rule wouldn't produce enough benefits.    Applying such a rule to smaller banks was resisted by the Federal Reserve Board and the Comptroller of the Currency because of the expense and questions about full audits' usefulness to the banks. Instead, Mr. Seidman said the FDIC staff would try to develop a framework for independent reviews of small banks that would be less extensive than a full opinion audit.    Of banks with assets of less than $100 million, only 58% obtain outside opinion audits. The FDIC currently requires independent audits of institutions with more than $50 million in assets only at the time they seek to convert to FDIC insurance coverage. </TEXT></DOC>
