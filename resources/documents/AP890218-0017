Authorities reported no violence. But they said the U.S.-runClark Air Base closed its main gate while the two groups held rivalevents within a few hundred yards of each other at a park nearby.   The anti-base concert featured dance and vocal performances withno speeches. City authorities earlier withdrew a permit they gavethe group, but they later reissued it under pressure from members ofthe Senate.   Many senators have criticized the presence of the bases onPhilippine territory and pressed President Corazon Aquino to demandthey be removed.   Groups for and against the bases have faced off here before.   Last month, several thousand residents of Angeles City, about 50miles north of Manila, prevented hundreds of base opponents fromentering the city during a march from Manila. The protesters weredemanding closure of Clark, Subic Bay Naval Base and four othersmaller U.S. facilities in the country.   Saturday's march through the city and the rally near the basewere organized by the city's Chamber of Commerce. Participantsincluded local officials led by Mayor Antonio Abad Santos and atleast a dozen government soldiers who marched in civilian clothes.   Abad Santos said Clark should not be closed because most of thecity's 200,000 residents depend on it for their livelihood.   ``Even our pickpockets will run out of business if the base isclosed,'' he said.   Last year, the U.S. and Philippine governments concluded anagreement allowing the United States to keep the bases until 1991 inexchange for $962 million in military and economic aid during thenext two years.   Mrs. Aquino has given no indication of her position onmaintaining the bases beyond 1991.</TEXT></DOC>
