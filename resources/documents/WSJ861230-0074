The cornfields are disappearing beneath heavy snow. The ice on the Kennebec River, once cut in blocks and shipped around the world, is thickening with each hour. The green dome of Maine's State House is barely visible from the other side of Capitol Street.    But inside the white shingles and green shutters of the Blaine House, for nearly seven decades home to Maine's governors, the lights are on, the fire is crackling and two men -- of different parties, different generations, different styles -- are discovering that their lives are about to undergo a transformation as dramatic as a change of season in Maine.    Here in this dreary outpost at the gateway to Maine's remote northern lakes and mountains, Democratic Gov. Joseph Brennan and Republican Rep. John McKernan are exchanging advice -- and jobs.    &quot;Wait until you see the mail I'm leaving you,&quot; warns Rep. McKernan, who is to become Maine's 70th governor next month. Gov. Brennan, who is leaving Blaine House after eight years for the U.S. House of Representatives, has a warning, too: The peculiar architecture of the governor's mansion means that Mr. McKernan must enter his new bedroom through the bathroom.    This unusual job swap, which provides insights about the nature of both positions and the texture of political life, elevates a two-term congressman to the highest office of a state Arnold Toynbee once called &quot;an unsophisticated museum piece inhabited by woodmen and watermen and hunters.&quot; At the same time, it is transforming a popular two-term governor who can't succeed himself again into a freshman congressman -- the first time in more than a quarter of a century that a governor has sought and won a House seat.    &quot;I don't see how anyone who's been governor can escape a big period of adjustment,&quot; says Republican Sen. Robert Stafford of Vermont, who relinquished the governor's office in Montpelier in 1960 when he unseated Democratic Rep. William Meyer. &quot;You find that you don't have any power at all.&quot;    Mr. Brennan is thinking about that now as he sits under the Waterford chandelier and pads around the two-toned mahogany-and-birch floor that once was the domain of James G. Blaine, the colorful House speaker, senator, secretary of state and 1884 presidential candidate who was alternately known as the Plumed Knight of the Republican Party and the &quot;continental liar from the State of Maine.&quot;    Mr. Brennan is giving up more than the state plane and the Lincoln Town Car he used to travel about this state, as big as the other five New England states combined. &quot;I don't think he knows how big a change he's in for,&quot; says Robert Gibbons, the governor's legal counsel. &quot;When you're governor, you pick up the phone and something happens. That isn't going to work on the House side of Capitol Hill.&quot;    The other day, in fact, Mr. Brennan emerged from a congressional orientation session in Washington with arithmetic on his mind as much as politics. &quot;As governor you're one of one,&quot; he said with a mix of wonder and wariness. &quot;You set your own legislative program -- highways, budgeting, education, everything. In Washington I'm one of 435 -- and that's only on the House side of the building. It's going to take some getting used to.&quot;    Like the 50 other freshmen, Mr. Brennan in the past several weeks has learned about setting up a congressional office, worked to win committee assignments and discovered that Rep. Jim Wright of Texas, who is to be the next speaker, and Rep. Thomas Foley of Washington, who is to be the majority leader, are very important people.    &quot;I kid about learning humility, but I'm as enthusiastic as I would have been if I came to Congress 20 years ago,&quot; says Mr. Brennan, who is 52 years old. &quot;I've been moaning for all these years about Washington, and now I'll be able to see if it can be changed at all.&quot;    The people of Maine had more trouble understanding why Mr. Brennan wanted to go to Washington than why Mr. McKernan wanted to come to Augusta.    &quot;There's a long tradition in Maine that sets the governor above all,&quot; says Christian Potholm, a political scientist at Bowdoin College in Brunswick. &quot;It's the place of highest esteem. Most people don't run for Congress so they can get to be governor someday, but in this state what McKernan did makes great sense.&quot;    Mr. Brennan ran for Mr. McKernan's House seat because neither Senate seat was available and he had nowhere else politically to turn. But as a measure of the high regard he holds for the governor's office, he won't resign the job in time to take the congressional oath with the other freshmen on Jan. 6. He'll wait until after his successor is sworn in here the evening of Jan. 8.    In the meantime, Mr. McKernan, who served two terms in the Maine Legislature before going to Congress, is reacquainting himself with the state Capitol, with its two stuffed moose in the basement, and is thinking about how he's going to fulfill campaign promises to bring jobs to far away towns like Jackman and Calais, on the Canadian border, and to control growth in southern coastal Maine, which is in danger of becoming swallowed by developers.    &quot;The question was whether I wanted to be part of the national process or whether I wanted to construct specific solutions to specific problems,&quot; says Mr. McKernan, who will be the first Republican governor in 20 years and, at 38, the nation's youngest sitting governor.    That decision came easily. Now he's working amid the metal folding chairs in his transition office in the austere chamber of the Senate Education Committee. His first budget must go to the printer two days after he's inaugurated.    He also is wondering how his life might change. He talks now of playing basketball in the driveway of Blaine House and maybe going to the 'Y' at noon, but he knows he's about to lose the comfortable anonymity of a minority backbencher in Washington.    &quot;I'll live in a public house with the press hanging around,&quot; he says. &quot;I'm going to need a little bit of privacy, a little bit of space. I hope I'm not going to have to be 'on' all the time.&quot;    Each has a bit of advice for the other. Mr. McKernan urges the new congressman not to grow frustrated with his lack of control over his own schedule. Mr. Brennan has a word for the new governor, who soon must face the 186 members of the Democratic-controlled Legislature: &quot;Don't take your own party and your old friends for granted. Otherwise you might see them on the six o'clock news saying a lot of things about you that aren't very nice.&quot;    Both men already have fashioned goals for themselves. Mr. Brennan says he's &quot;looking forward to voting against the war in Nicaragua,&quot; and hopes to become involved in arms-control issues. &quot;You can't do those kinds of things in Augusta,&quot; he says. &quot;In Washington I'll actually have a voice -- not major, maybe, but a voice.&quot;    Mr. McKernan is eager to build his state, whose economy has been a victim of its geography for a century, into a telecommunications empire. &quot;In a high-tech age, geography doesn't matter,&quot; he says. &quot;If you have a telecommunications network, you can do things as easily in Machias as you can in Manhattan.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
