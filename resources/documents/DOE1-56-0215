A two-stage light-gas gunis used as pre-injector. Each round-bore HELEOS railgun module is 12.7mm in diameter and 2.4 m long. The muzzle end of the railgun is connectedto a vacuum tank. Common materials and fabrication technology are usedin the manufacture of all components, and modular design allows for extendingthe length of the railgun as progress dictates. The launcher uses a &quot;veeblock&quot; geometry, which is designed to: provide compressive preload; operatewith a 300-MPa (3-kbar) internal bore pressure; and easily accommodateinterchangeable materials in the bore support structure and rail. Wehave performed full-scale material testing of the railgun and have developeda precision round-bore fabrication process. Air-gage inspection is usedto determine bore diameter and straightness. We have also developed asurface mapping system to document the surface topography of the borebefore and after an experiment. This paper presents fabrication details,results of tests conducted, and areas for potential improvement. 12 refs.,6 figs., 1 tab.</TEXT></DOC>
