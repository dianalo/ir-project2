(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A U.S. Bankruptcy Court judge signed anorder Wednesday formally selling the PTL ministry's assets to aToronto real estate investor for $65 million.   Buyer Stephen Mernick has 11 days to come up with a $3.25 milliondeposit. If all goes as planned, in 41 days, Mernick would assumethe administration and operation of PTL's headquarters, whichincludes a Christian theme park and satellite television studios.   Judge Rufus Reynolds, who signed the order in his Greensborooffice, approved the offer Dec. 13 in bankruptcy court in Columbia,S.C.   But the Rev. Sam Johnson, pastor of Heritage Village Church atPTL and president of Heritage Ministries, told The CharlotteObserver that he hasn't given up his hope to buy PTL's headquartersin Fort Mill, S.C.   Charlotte broadcasting executive Cy Bahakel also may contest thesale. Bahakel claimed he wasn't given a fair chance to beatMernick's bid, and his lawyer, Faison Barnes, said two weeks agoBahakel would appeal the order.   On Wednesday, Barnes declined to say whether Bahakel would followthrough with an appeal. ``We have to see the order itself to knowexactly what we plan to do,'' he said.   The order is expected to be filed Thursday in U.S. BankruptcyCourt in Columbia.   PTL has been in bankruptcy court since June 1987, three monthsafter former leader Jim Bakker resigned in a sex and money scandal.   Mernick, an Orthodox Jew, has said he is willing to deal withHeritage Ministries about keeping alive Christian broadcasting onthe PTL satellite television network. He said in October that he wasinterested in PTL as a real estate deal.   The network, carried on more than 800 cable systems, is amongPTL's most valued assets. Other assets include 1,700 undevelopedacres in South Carolina just south of Charlotte; two 500-roomhotels, one of them unfinished; and a water park.   Once Mernick pays the balance of the $65 million, the money wouldbe distributed to PTL's creditors.</TEXT></DOC>
