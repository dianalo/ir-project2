But a Christmas gift list that runs on and on?Well, look no farther than your back yard and kitchen cupboard -- with alittle help from a crafts store -- for some creative, inexpensive gifts youcan make yourself.;   Here are some ideas:  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Garden  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  YULE JEWELS ON A BUDGET: ASSEMBLE YOUR WHAT-NOTS TOMAKE CHEAPIE GIFTS  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Holiday; See also related article on page 1D of this section.; Mercury Newswire contributed to this story.  </MEMO><TEXT>      Baskets, wreaths;   Whether you copy the idea from a book or create yourown design, baskets and wreaths are among the easiest -- and least expensive-- gifts to make.;   &quot;There's no right, or wrong way to decorate a basket orwreath. It's whatever appeals to you, what- ever makes you happy,&quot; saysMarlene Calla, a San Jose homemaker who creates these natural gifts as ahobby.;   Instead of wandering through a shop randomly picking up bits andpieces to decorate a basket, Calla says it is best to think out the idea firstand then assemble the flowers, ribbons and what-nots to be used.;   &quot;You canmake a basket that would cost $20 in a store for as little as $4 or $5 worthof material,&quot; Calla says.;   Inexpensive is, indeed, the name of the game,says Dawn Cusick in her book &quot;Decorating Baskets&quot; (Sterling, $14.95). You mayhave to buy the basket, and perhaps some trim, but &quot;once your imagination getsgoing, you may find a treasure of basket decorations in your own home,&quot; Cusickwrites.;   Some of her ideas: Miniature pine cones or sea shells collected onvacation might make a gorgeous basket. Sort through your boxes of Christmasornaments, check out your sewing basket, search among favorite collectibles,your junk drawer and the kids' toy box to find items that could double asdecorations.;   One of the easiest: Fill basket with ornaments and pine cones,then tie a red ribbon on the handle. It's a simple idea that shouts&quot;Christmas.&quot;;   Scents;   Although heavenly smells go with Christmas, somepotpourri recipes are pretty complicated. But it doesn't have to be that way.;  In &quot;The Penny Whistle Christmas Party Book&quot; (Simon and Schuster, $12),Meredith Brokaw and Annie Gilbar include a &quot;faux&quot; potpourri children can make.Fill a square of lace with straw packing material and add a few drops ofcinnamon or pine scent. Tie with a ribbon and a twig of evergreen. &quot;It smellsheavenly,&quot; the authors promise.;   Mona Lundstrom, a San Jose herb gardener,makes a kitchen sachet that is equally easy. The primary ingredient is smallcedar chips -- actually hamster bedding purchased at a pet store. Use two cupsof cedar chips with 10 drops each of essential oils: eucalyptus, penny royal,lavender and rose geranium. Sew 2-by-4-inch sachet bags from cloth scraps Or,purchase muslin sachet bags in that size.;   Two cups of cedar chip mixturewill fill six to eight bags, she says. Tie with a ribbon. &quot;You put thesesachets in a cupboard to ward off moths and beetles,&quot; Lundstrom says.;  Another quickie to make is an oatmeal bath sachet. Mix one cup of Quaker OldFashioned Oatmeal with one cup of dried lavender buds and (optional) one cupof dried rose petals. Put into small sachet bags and tie with a waterproofribbon.;   At bath time, hang the sachet bag from the faucet so the water runsthrough it. &quot;You'll have a wonderfully relaxing scented bath,&quot; Lundstrom says.It can be reused two or three times.;   If you failed to grow you own herbs,you can buy them by the bulk at natural food store such as Bread of Life inSan Jose. Scented floral makings and essential oils for potpourris and sachetsare available at Crabtree andamp; Evelyn specialty stores at Valley Fair and Vallco,and Saso Herb Gardens in Los Gatos. Sachet bags are also available.;   If allof this sounds like too much trouble, Briston of San Jose will customizeherbal gift baskets using natural materials from Lundstrom's garden.Information: (408) 298-2610.;   Growing gifts;   It's easy to put togetherinexpensive gifts for gardeners. Such gifts are akin to those you make or bakeyourself, not much money but treasured because of the personal touch.;   Awindowsill herb garden delivers fresh bits of herbs for savory dishes. Tocreate a miniature kitchen garden, purchase an oblong decorative containerthat will fit on a windowsill. Fill the container with three to five smallpots of herbs.;   Choose herbs that adapt to winter conditions indoors, thenconsider the cook's preferences. Curly parsley, thyme, chives, winter savory,rosemary, salad burnet, sage, basil and lemon balm are good bets for a brightsouth-facing window.;   When thinking windowsill gardens, also check outAfrican violets, tiny cactuses and succulents, and miniature cyclamens fordish gardens. The trick is to match up houseplants with similar growing needs.Don't combine cactuses and African violets, for instance.;   Use yourimagination when wandering through the nursery and you'll be amazed at theneat gift possibilities. You could create a grow-your-own salad, for instance,by presenting leafy lettuce seedlings, garlic sets, rooted basil cuttings, anda bottle of Italian dressing. The combinations are endless.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  JOAN JACKSON, Mercury News Garden Editor  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   911212  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Thursday  </DAY><MONTH>  December  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1D  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  887  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Thursday, December 12, 199100347114,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
