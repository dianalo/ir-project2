(Case No. RF-005).The Energy Conservation Program for Consumer Products (other than automobiles)was established pursuant to the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (EPCA),Pub. L. 94-163, 89 Stat. 917, as amended by the National Energy ConservationPolicy Act (NECPA), Pub. L. 95-619, 92 Stat. 3266, the National ApplianceEnergy Conservation Act of 1987 (NAECA), Pub. L. 100-12, and the NationalAppliance Energy Conservation Amendment of 1988 (NAECA 1988), Pub. L. 100-357,which requires DOE to prescribe standardized test procedures to measurethe energy consumption of certain consumer products, including refrigerators,refrigerator-freezers, and freezers. The intent of the test proceduresis to provide a comparable measure of energy consumption that will assistconsumers in making purchasing decisions. These test procedures appearat 10 CFR Part 430, Subpart B. DOE has amended the prescribed test procedures by adding 10 CFR 430.27on September 26, 1980, creating the waiver process. 45 FR 64108. DOE furtheramended the Department's appliance test procedure waiver process to allowthe Assistant Secretary for Conservation and Renewable Energy to grantan interim waiver from test procedure requirements to manufacturers thathave petitioned DOE for a waiver of such prescribed test procedures. 51FR 42823, Novemver 26, 1986. The waiver process allows the Assistant Secretaryfor Conservation and Renewable Energy to waive temporarily test proceduresfor a particular basic model when a petitioner shows that the basic modelcontains one or more design characteristics which prevent testing accordingto the prescribed test procedures or when the prescribed test proceduresmay evaluate the basic model in a manner so unrepresentative of its trueenergy consumption as to provide materially inaccurate comparative data.Waivers generaly remain in effect until final test procedure amendmentsbecome effective, resolving the problem that is the subject of a waiver.Amana Refrigeration, Inc., (Amana) filed both a ``Petition for Waiver''and ``Application for Interim Waiver,'' dated October 10, 1988, in accordancewith andSection; 430.27 of 10 CFR Part 430. DOE granted the ``Applicationfor Interim Waiver'' under section andSection; 430.27(g) on December 1, 1988and published it in the<T4> Federal Register</T4> on December 8, 1988. Amana's petition for waiverwas published in the<T4> Federal Register</T4> on December 8, 1988, soliciting comments, dataand information respecting the petition. 53 FR 49590.No comments were received concerning the ``Petition for Waiver.'' DOE consultedwith the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), concerning the Amana petitionon January 4, 1989. The FTC had no opposition to the issuance of the waiverto Amana. <ITAG tagnum="84">Assertions and Determinations</ITAG>Amana's petition seeked a waiver from the DOE test provisions that requirethe energy consumption of refrigerator-freezers be determined by AppendixA1 of Subpart B of 10 CFR 430. Amana stated that the existing test proceduredoes not adequately evaluate the true energy consumption of its productbecause there is no provision in the existing test procedure to determinethe interval between defrost cycles for a refrigerator-freezer with a variabledefrost control. Amana believes that the existing test procedure is likelyto incorrectly estimate the energy consumption of these models, thereby,misleading the consumer. Since the current DOE test procedures do not addressthis control feature, Amana asked that the waiver be granted. Amana requestedapproval to perform testing to determine the energy consumption of itsvariable defrost models in accordance with the DOE variable defrost testprocedure as proposed and published in the<T4> Federal Register</T4> on September 26, 1988. 53 FR 37416.Amana identified four current waivers which DOE had issued for similarcontrol features. Three of the four were issued to Whirlpool Corporation,Case No. RF-001, 50 FR 1628, Jan. 11, 1985, Case Nos. RF-003 and RF-004,51 FR 36591, Oct. 14, 1986. The fourth waiver was issued to White ConsolidatedIndustries, Case No. RF-002, 51 FR 15679, April 26, 1986.Based on the information provided by the petitioner and the Department'sreview, DOE is granting Amana's request for the use of an alternate testprocedure to determine the energy consumption for its model DE-25 variabledefrost control refrigerator-freezer with modifications.It is, therefore, ordered that:(1) The ``Petition for Waiver'' filed by Amana Refrigeration, Inc., (RF-005)is hereby granted as set forth in paragraph (2) below, subject to the provisionsof paragraphs (3), (4) and (5).(2) Not withstanding any contrary provisions of Appendix A-1 of 10 CFRPart 430 Subpart B, Amana Refrigeration, Inc. shall be permitted to testits model DE-25 refrigerator-freezer on the basis specified in 10 CFR Part430, with the modifications set forth below:(i) Add: section 4.1.2.2 Variable defrost control. If the model being testedhas a variable defrost control system, the test shall consist of threeparts. Two parts shall be the same as the test for Long-time automaticdefrost (section 4.1.2.1). The third part is to determine the time betweendefrost (section 5.2.1.3).(ii) Add the following to the end of section 5.1.2.: For models equippedwith variable defrost controls, compartment temperatures shall be thosemeasured in the first part of the test period specified in 4.1.2.2 above.(iii) Add: section 5.2.1.3 Variable defrost control. The energy consumptionin kilowatt-hours per day shall be calculated equivalent to:<ITAG tagnum="26">ET=(1440xEP1/T1)+(EP2^(EP1xT2/T1))x(12/CT) where ET and 1440 are definedin 5.2.1.1 and EP1, EP2, T1, T2 and 12 are defined in 5.2.1.2</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CT=(CT<T2>L</T2>xCT<T2>M</T2>)/(Fx(CT<T2>M</T2>^CT<T2>L</T2>)+CT<T2>L</T2>)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="24">CT</ITAG><T2>L</T2>=least or shortest time between defrosts (not less than 12 hours)<ITAG tagnum="24">CT</ITAG><T2>M</T2>=maximum time between defrost cycles in tenths of an hour (greaterthan CT<T2>L</T2> but not more than 84 hours)<ITAG tagnum="24">F=ratio of per day energy consumption in excess of the least energyand the maximum difference in per day energy consumption</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="24">F=(1/CT^1/CT</ITAG><T2>M</T2>)/(1CT<T2>L</T2>^1/CT<T2>M</T2>)<ITAG tagnum="24"> =(ET^ET</ITAG><T2>L</T2>)/(ET<T2>M</T2>^ET<T2>L</T2>)<ITAG tagnum="24">  or F=0.20 in lieu of testing to find CT</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="24">ET</ITAG><T2>L</T2>=least electrical energy used (kilowatt hours)<ITAG tagnum="24">ET</ITAG><T2>M</T2>=maximum electrical energy used (kilowatt hours)<ITAG tagnum="24">CT=MTBDx0.5</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">where</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">MTBD=mean time between defrosts</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L1(0,0,0),b1,tp0,p8,8/1,g1,t1,aw,6,1,4</C> <H1>MTBD</H1><H1>=</H1><H1/><T4>a</T4>X<H2>N</H2><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">where</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">X=time between defrost cycles</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">N=number of defrost cycles</ITAG>(3) The waiver shall remain in effect from the date of issuance of thisOrder until the Department of Energy prescribes final test procedures appropriateto the model DE-25 refrigerator-freezer manufactured by Amana Refrigeration,Inc.(4) This waiver is based upon the presumed validity of statements, allegations,and documentary materials submitted by the applicant.
