Freedman (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> LIG MO LTR AMB </CO><IN> TOB MKT </IN><TEXT>   Lawyers say that the landmark lawsuit brought by Antonio Cipollone -- whose wife, Rose, died of lung cancer in 1984 -- will usher in a whole new era in tobacco liability cases.    On Monday, in an unprecedented blow to the tobacco industry, a federal jury in Newark, N.J., awarded Mr. Cipollone $400,000 in damages after finding that Liggett Group Inc. wrongly implied cigarettes were safe in its advertising before 1966. The jury also found that Liggett should have warned customers about the dangers of smoking in its ads prior to that year, when Congress mandated health warnings on cigarette packs.    As a result of the decision, lawyers on both sides expect that more tobacco liability suits will be filed, adding to the 100 or so already pending. And from now on, the task for plaintiffs' attorneys will be easier -- and cheaper. After spending five years and about $3 million pressing the Cipollone case, Marc Edell, the plaintiff's lead counsel, forced cigarette makers to disclose for the first time thousands of pages of confidential documents. These, many predict, will be used against the tobacco industry in future cases.    &quot;The tobacco companies' myth of invulnerability has been shattered,&quot; says Richard Daynard, head of Tobacco Products Liability Project, an anti-smoking activist group.    Tobacco-company attorneys minimize the effect of the ruling. &quot;I think these cases are in reality very difficult for plaintiffs to meet their burden of proof, and most good plaintiffs' lawyers know that,&quot; says Frank Decker, an attorney for Liggett who notes that the company will appeal the verdict. Mr. Decker adds that a crucial part of the case -- the internal documents -- &quot;turned out not to have much impact.&quot;    Nevertheless, other plaintiffs are likely to use the same arguments that worked for Mr. Edell. &quot;Failure to warn could be leveled against every tobacco company,&quot; says Calvert Crary, a litigation analyst at Martin Simpson andamp; Co., a New York brokerage company.    Like Liggett, many cigarette makers have at one time made implied promises about the safety of their products. &quot;More Doctors Smoke Camels,&quot; R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. assured smokers in the late 1940s. In the early 1950s, Lorillard Inc. termed the &quot;micronite filter&quot; in its Kent cigarettes &quot;so safe, so effective it has been selected to help filter the air in hospital operating rooms.&quot;    Such ads will &quot;probably lead to dozens of express warranty claims,&quot; predicts Don Barrett, a Lexington, Miss., attorney who represented a plaintiff in a case against American Brands Inc. that ended in a mistrial earlier this year. In the Cipollone case, the jury held that Liggett, by claiming its products were safe in pre-1966 ads, had in effect given a warranty.    Even the arguments that didn't work well for Mr. Edell are apt to work better for other plaintiffs, some lawyers say. New Jersey product-liability law makes it more difficult than in many other states for a plaintiff to collect damages, and Mrs. Cipollone's behavior weakened the case because it wasn't clear she ever tried to quit. Also, while Judge H. Lee Sarokin restricted Mr. Edell to evidence from before 1966, future judges may decide otherwise.    Some product-liability lawyers say the evolution of tobacco cases is reminiscent of previous battles involving such products as asbestos, tampons and the Dalkon Shield. The pattern, they point out, is that it takes a long time for plaintiffs to accumulate enough evidence to make a breakthrough in court. Moreover, initial awards tend to be small. Mr. Daynard, the anti-smoking activist, notes the first asbestos-exposure case won by a plaintiff, decided in 1972, brought an $80,000 damage award.    However, lawyers also note that tobacco makes for a harder liability battle than many other products. &quot;Courts are reluctant to create class actions in (tobacco) cases because (the cases) each have an individual identity,&quot; says Roger Brosnahan, a Minneapolis product-liability lawyer. Also, juries are likely to feel more sympathy for a worker unwittingly exposed to asbestos than for a smoker who knew his habit was risky, explains Donald Garner, a professor of law at Southern Illinois University.    One of the most critical issues in the Cipollone case was whether Liggett and the two other defendants -- Philip Morris Inc., a subsidiary of Philip Morris Cos., and Lorillard, a Loews Corp. subsidiary -- conspired to suppress evidence that smoking was unsafe. The jury found in favor of the defendants, but the conspiracy argument is still likely to appear in future cases.    Don L. Davis, an Austin, Texas, lawyer who is currently handling 11 pending tobacco lawsuits, says he plans to use the conspiracy claim in all his cases. He asserts that the argument failed in the Cipollone case largely because attorneys were restricted to pre-1966 evidence.    Despite its partial defeat in the Cipollone case, the tobacco industry isn't expected to change its legal strategy substantially. The mainstays of that strategy have been that smokers have to take personal responsibility for their conduct and that the medical evidence about smoking and disease is ambiguous. &quot;These will continue to be the basic themes of our defense,&quot; says Steven Parrish, trial counsel for Lorillard and Philip Morris.    Plaintiffs' attorneys maintain, however, that tobacco companies will have to make some changes in their tactics. &quot;I don't know how much longer they will be able to say it hasn't been proven that cigarette smoking causes lung cancer,&quot; says Cynthia Walters, an attorney for Mr. Cipollone. The Cipollone jury found, for the first time, that smoking was at least partly to blame for a smoker's death.    Cigarette makers' free-choice argument is likely to face its most critical test early next year, in a trial brought by the family of a Mississippi man who died of lung cancer. Lawyers for the family plan to argue that Anderson Smith couldn't make an informed choice about smoking because he was brain damaged as the result of a World War II injury. An attorney for the defendant, American Tobacco Co., says the American Brands unit plans to argue that Mr. Smith made a free choice because he began smoking before his injury.    The Smith case and others could be easier for plaintiffs to win simply because the tobacco industry's winning streak has been broken. James Upshaw, a Greenwood, Miss., attorney representing American Tobacco in the Smith case, says each trial has to be looked at individually. But he concedes that the Cipollone decision may have a psychological impact on jurors in the future.    &quot;The next jury won't have to be the first to award damages,&quot; says Alan Darnell, a lawyer for Mr. Cipollone. &quot;It's a lot easier to be second than first.&quot; And the momentum could accelerate, some predict. Says Stanley M. Chesley, a Cincinnati product-liability lawyer, &quot;Once victories are scored, the tide changes with public opinion.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
