Byrdannounced Monday he will call up the U.S.-Soviet medium-rangemissile treaty for debate Tuesday, opening a race to ratify itbefore President Reagan meets with Soviet leader Mikhail S.Gorbachev at the Moscow summit.   Byrd acted after three Senate committees formally concluded thatdisputes over the on-site inspection provisions of theIntermediate-range Nuclear Forces Treaty have been resolved and nolonger prevent opening debate on ratifying the pact.   The decision followed testimony in which Secretary of StateGeorge P. Shultz said that in talks last week with Soviet ForeignMinister Eduard Shevardnadze on the disputed points, ``We got whatwe needed and wanted.''   Byrd told reporters that on the recommendation of the chairmenand senior Republican members of the Senate Foreign Relations,Intelligence and Armed Services committees, ``I feel satisfied thatwe're justified in taking up the treaty and I plan to do so at somepoint tomorrow.''   The INF treaty, signed at the White House on Dec. 8 by Reaganand Gorbachev, would require the elimination of all U.S. and Sovietmissiles with a range of between 300 and 3,400 miles.   Byrd had refused to permit debate on ratifying the pact toproceed until disputes on implementing the on-site inspectionprovision and on futuristic weapons had been resolved.   On Monday night, Byrd said he hoped the treaty could be ratifiedby the May 29 opening of the Moscow summit but he could notguarantee it.   Finishing the treaty by the time of the summit will depend onthe nature of the debate and the number of amendments that areoffered, he said.   ``I am in no position at this point to say we can finish or wewon't finish,'' Byrd said. ``I hope we can. But nobody can answerthat at this point.''   Byrd said he plans to call up the treaty and stay on it butnoted there may be some roadblocks.   For example, he said that if Reagan vetoes the trade bill, anattempt to override that action would take precedence over thetreaty and would interrupt its consideration.   In addition, a small band of treaty opponents led by Sen. JesseHelms, R-N.C., has vowed to mount a drive to make substantialchanges in the pact, changes that would force the re-negotiation ofthe accord. Helms, who denied that his objective was to delayaction on the treaty until after the summit, said last week that heplans to offer ``something like a dozen'' amendments.   Such anti-treaty amendments are given little chance of adoption.   Vote counts show that when the final vote is taken, the treatylikely will be ratified by an overwhelming Senate majority, fargreater than the required two-thirds vote.   Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., the Armed Services chairman, said he wassatisfied by the agreement worked out between Shultz andShevardnadze in Geneva and said: ``I believe they have done a goodjob in satisfying the very serious problems that were raised.''   Sen. David Boren, D-Okla., the Intelligence Committee chairman,told reporters that the committees concluded that theShultz-Shevardnadze talks resolved all nine disputed pointsregarding the implementation of on-site inspection as well as adispute over whether the treaty embraces such futuristic weapons asthose using laser rays and particle beam generators.   ``It is the feeling that these points that have been in disputenow have been resolved,'' Boren said, adding he was speaking forthe Armed Services committee as well as his own.   Shultz earlier appealed to the Senate to ratify the treatybefore the summit and said that all nine outstanding on-siteinspection issues have been ``resolved to our satisfaction.''   He told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that in dealingwith disputes with the Soviets on the implementation of on-siteinspection arrangements to detect cheating, ``what we did wasinsist that precisely the terms of the treaty be lived up to onboth sides.''   As a result of the talks with Shevardnadze, ``we and the Sovietsnot only agree on the rights and obligations established in thistreaty, but also on procedures to carry them out,'' he said.   It is clear, Shultz asserted, that the treaty is in the nationalsecurity interests of the United States because it ``removes,forever, a Soviet nuclear threat that has confronted our NATOallies for 30 years.''   Responding to questions, Shultz said a recent Soviet test of asea-launched cruise missile from a land-based launcher does notappear to violate the treaty for two reasons, one of them being thefact the treaty is not yet in effect.   The other, Shultz said, is that the test appears to have fallenshort of 300 miles and therefore does not fall within the treaty'sdefinition of a medium-range missile.   But Helms, citing news accounts of the test, insisted itrepresents a treaty violation and said it makes him wonder ``why weare even talking about giving assent to ratification at all.''   U.S. officials said the Soviets had retreated from a hardlineposition on how the on-site inspection would work and would nowpermit inspectors to look inside any container or vehicle largeenough to contain the smallest stage of any banned missile or largeenough to hold a partially completed SS-20 missile.   Inspectors also will be allowed to use cameras and to lookinside any building or container inside a facility covered by thetreaty, officials said.   Failure to consent to the ratification of the treaty by May 29would virtually eliminate any chances Reagan might have for makingprogress on a treaty aimed at reducing long-range strategic nuclearweapons by as much as 50 percent, treaty supporters contend.</TEXT></DOC>
