Applicant also proposes to seek the appointment of FloridaAsset Management Group, Inc. by the FSLIC as an assets manager of one ormore failed savings and loan associations from time to time.The activities for which approval is requested have not previously beenapproved by the Board. The Board has determined that bank holding companiesmay provide management consulting advice to nonaffiliated bank and nonbankdepository institutions under certain conditions, but has not authorizedsuch activities to be provided on either a daily or a continuing basis,except as necessary to instruct the client institution on how to performsuch services for itself. Section 225.25(b)(11) of Regulation Y (12 CFR225.25(b)(11)).Section 4(c)(8) of the BHC Act provides that a bank holding company mayengage in any activity that the Board has determined to be ``so closelyrelated to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incidentthereto.'' Applicant contends that the proposed activities meet this standard.A particular activity may be found to meet the ``closely related to banking''test if it is demonstrated that banks have generally provided the proposedactivity; that banks generally provide services that are operationallyor functionally so similar to the proposed activity so as to equip themparticularly well to provide the proposed activity; or that banks generallyprovide services that are so integrally related to the proposed activityas to require their provision in a specialized form. <T3>National Courier Ass'n v. Board of Governors</T3>, 516 F.2d 1229, 1237(D.C. Cir. 1975). In addition, the Board may consider any other basis thatmay demonstrate that the activity has a reasonable or close relationshipto banking or managing or controlling banks. Board Statement RegardingRegulation Y, 49 FR 806 (1984).In determining whether an activity meets the second, or proper incidentto banking, test of section 4(c)(8), the Board must consider whether theperformance of the activity by an affiliate of a holding company ``canreasonably be expected to produce benefits to the public, such as greaterconvenience, increased competition, or gains in efficiency that outweighpossible adverse effects, such as undue concentration of resources, decreasedor unfair competition, conflicts of interests, or unsound banking practices.''Any views or requests for hearing should be submitted in writing and receivedby William W.
