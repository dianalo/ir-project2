(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Republican nominee George Bush todayrejected Democratic charges that his campaign advertising is racistin stressing the case of Willie Horton Jr., a black convictedmurderer who raped a white woman after escaping from aMassachusetts prison furlough.   The vice president responded to charges from Sen. Lloyd Bentsen,the Rev. Jesse Jackson and others as he flew to New England for aday-long campaign tour aimed at making trouble for Democraticnominee Michael Dukakis in his own territory.   ``There isn't any racism,'' Bush told reporters on Air ForceTwo. ``It's absolutely ridiculous and everybody sees this as somedesperation kind of move, basing it on one ad.''   The Democrats had accused the GOP nominee of inflaming racialfears by emphasizing the Horton case, which has been a favoriteBush theme in speeches and television commercials charging thatDukakis is soft on crime.   A Republican Party campaign flier mailed recently to severalhundred thousand New Yorkers featured a photograph of Horton, whonow is imprisoned in Maryland where the woman's rape and theslashing of her fiance occurred.   ``I stand fully behind these ads, and at the last minute _ thoseads have been on a long, long time _ for some concerted effort withall these people going out saying the same thing, I mean people seethis for what it is _ a campaign tactic. I stand 100 percent behindthose ads. I think the American people are smart,'' Bush said.   He tried to turn the attack against Dukakis by noting that theDemocrats are running an ad about a man from a halfway house inBush's hometown of Houston who murdered a minister's wife. Bush wasa supporter of the halfway house.   ``What about their ad about the halfway house? Is that racismagainst Hispanics?'' Bush asked.   The racism charges were termed ``totally absurd'' by GOP vicepresidential candidate Dan Quayle during a flight to Missouri. ``Ithink it shows just how desperate they really are to start fanningthe fires of racism in this country,'' Quayle said.   Later, at a rain-swept rally outside Portland City Hall inMaine, Bush was heckled by several hundred Dukakis supporters whochanted, `No More Lies.''   ``I don't blame these people,'' Bush said. ``If I had acandidate like that, who went around the United States tellingeverybody how bad everything was, I'd try to yell a little bit,too.''   Arriving in Waterbury, Bush told an airport crowd that ``we arenot going to be deterred by the negative attacks coming out of theother side.''   In the closing days of the campaign, he said, ``I'm going to runlike I'm 10 points back all across this country.''   The theme of the day was economics, and Bush lambasted Dukakisin a speech prepared for delivery before a group of businessleaders.   ``My opponent now wants to turn back to clog up the circulatorysystem of America's economy with exactly the kind of big governmentschemes the Europeans are discarding,'' the vice president said.   ``Economists call the resulting economic paralysis`Eurosclerosis.' I call it Dukakonomics. It rhymes withCarternomics. It didn't work then, and it won't work now.''   To Dukakis' complaint that GOP campaign ads are ``full oflies,'' Bush retorted that the Massachusetts governor had liedabout his record. ``He is upset, not because it's false, butbecause he is weak on crime and defense, and that's the inescapabletruth,'' Bush said.   Going into the home stretch of the presidential race, Bushheaded for rallies today in Waterbury, Conn., Portland, Maine, andBurlington, Vt., as he began a final, non-stop stretch ofcampaigning that will take him to California and back to Washington.   Press aide Mark Goodin said the trip marks the start of 15straight days of campaigning with no more breaks until the Nov. 8election.   Confident that his political base in the Souh and Rocky Mountainstates is secure, Bush is trying to harass Dukakis in his region.   None of the states on today's itinerary packs many of theelectoral votes needed to win the White House. Of the 270 neededfor victory, Connecticut offers only eight, Maine has four andVermont has three.   However, Bush's strategists consider it a good investment oftime because it could weaken Dukakis on his home turf and force himto devote time and resources in an area that should belong to him.   With Dukakis trailing in the polls, ``he's got to fight amulti-front war,'' said Goodin, the spokesman for Bush. ``He needsevery vote at this point.   ``It's now a strategy of locking him out,'' said Goodin. ``We'retaking his base away from him.''   Goodin said polls show Bush is ahead in Connecticut, Maine andVermont.   Eyeing the most politically important state in the Northeast,Goodin said Bush is down in New York four to six points but is``extremely competitive'' in a state once regarded safe for Dukakis.   Bush has spent only one day in New York and spent virtually nomoney there, Goodin said.   ``We may yet go in again ... if we can take it away or at leastmake him fight for it,'' Goodin said.   After today's trip, Bush will return to Washington for thenight, setting out Tuesday for Ohio with stops in Columbus, Akronand Lima and an overnight in Detroit.   Bush will spend Wednesday in Michigan, South Dakota and Montana,Thursday in Washington state and California, Friday in Californiaand Nebraska and Saturday in Illinois.</TEXT></DOC>
