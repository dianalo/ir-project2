Stempel, chairman andchief executive officer, in announcing the cutbacks. &quot;GM willbecome a much different corporation.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   GM said its closings will include six vehicle-assemblyplants, in addition to four previously disclosed. It alsowill close four engine/transmission plants and 11parts-making facilities. GM also will cut 9,000 white-collarjobs and 15,000 hourly workers next year through attritionand retirements, freeze hiring in 1992 and sell offnon-automotive assets.   Mr. Stempel said, however, that GM intends to keepElectronic Data Systems Corp. and Hughes Aircraft Co., twokey elements of the company's diversification thrust of the1980s.   Mr. Stempel's mid-afternoon news conference followed atelevised speech to employees, and capped an intense andpainful day for the world's largest industrial company. Injust 16 months on the job, Mr. Stempel has presided over thelargest retreat in GM's long history. Just over a year ago,GM announced major plant closings and a $3.3 billion pretaxwrite-off.   The announcement also was the latest in a string of jobcuts at major corporations, including International BusinessMachines Corp. and TRW Inc. Mr. Stempel said he was &quot;veryconcerned&quot; that the recent string of bad news will add to thenation's economic gloom, and postpone a recovery. The U.S.,he said, &quot;has got to be back in the job creation business.&quot;   GM's plant shutdowns and staff cutbacks could have someimpact on the companies that supply parts and services to theaffected GM facilities. But fewer GM factories won'tnecessarily translate into reduced output of GM vehicles orreduced business for suppliers. That's because many of the GMfacilities to be closed are now sitting largely idle anyway.In fact, Goodyear Tire andamp; Rubber Co. said GM's cuts shouldhave no effect on the number of tires it supplies to the automaker.   Despite its huge scope, Mr. Stempel's announcement leftunanswered a host of questions, including:   -- Just which factories will be shuttered. The companynamed some possible targets -- either the plant in Arlington,Texas, or Ypsilanti, Mich., for instance -- but didn'tidentify which one. Mr. Stempel said GM isn't trying to&quot;whipsaw&quot; concessions from workers or local governments, buta factory-vs.-factory competition seems inevitable.   -- The size and timing of a charge against earnings. &quot;Themagnitude and timing of any such charge haven't yet beendetermined, and will require further management considerationand board review,&quot; GM said. But the charge will be less thanthe $3.3 billion before taxes taken in the 1990 thirdquarter, GM added.   -- Whether the United Auto Workers union will cooperate inthe cost-cutting efforts. Mr. Stempel said he has asked theUAW to reopen the three-year contract that expires in 1993,but to no avail. Among other things, GM wants the union toscrap contract provisions requiring the company to hire oneworker for every two that leave.   But shortly after Mr. Stempel's news conference, the UAWdenounced GM's moves as capitulating to &quot;the insatiabledemands of the Ebenezer Scrooge types who run Wall Street,&quot;and vowed to &quot;vigorously enforce&quot; the current contract.   Mr. Stempel said he had hoped to delay announcing GM'scuts until next month, when he would have been able to bemore specific. But media speculation about coming cutbacksforced the company to move earlier, he said, so employeeswouldn't &quot;sit and stew over rumors.&quot; He added: &quot;Once storiesstarted to feed on stories, we had to come out and say wherewe are.&quot;   The executive said GM would specify the plants to beclosed &quot;as soon as we can,&quot; but he declined to set a deadlinefor the announcement. Thus, besides saying it will closeeither Arlington or Ypsilanti, GM said only that it willconsolidate five plants that build midsized cars &quot;to amaximum of four.&quot;   But by the end of 1995, it's clear that GM will be a farsmaller company. The projected North American work force --71,000 white-collar people and 250,000 hourly workers -- willbe about half the size of GM's total employment in 1985. The10 assembly plants that GM is closing equals the total thatChrysler Corp. will have in North America after it shuts asmall Canadian facility next year.   The 10 GM plants to be closed have the capacity to buildabout two million cars and trucks a year. Their eliminationwill slash the company's overall annual North Americancapacity to between five million and 5.5 million cars andtrucks. That will allow the company to use 100% of its NorthAmerican capacity by 1993, Mr. Stempel said -- a year laterthan the company had earlier promised.   &quot;The key is to be able to operate profitably&quot; with amarket share in the low to middle 30% range, Mr. Stempeldeclared. GM currently has 35.1% of the U.S. car and truckmarket, but enough factories to supply about 40% of themarket in a strong sales year.   This costly, idle plant capacity has prevented GM fromearning more than marginal profits in North America since1985. Currently the company is losing about $500 million amonth in the U.S. and Canada, analysts estimate. Mr. Stempelsaid that because of the cutbacks, &quot;In the next couple ofyears we'll see some very positive moves in terms of NorthAmerican profitability.&quot;   Yesterday's announcement indicates the company's businesssituation has deteriorated far more than it expected just ayear ago. When GM announced its $3.3 billion write-off inOctober 1990, company officials said they didn't expectfurther write-offs and closings until after 1993. But therecession and drop in consumer confidence changed all that,even though GM's market share has stabilized this year aftera lengthy decline.   Mr. Stempel, in fact, isn't ruling out further cutbacks.He said the company has a &quot;contingency plan&quot; if the economydoesn't improve by late next year. The executive said hedoesn't expect much improvement in the economy for the nextsix months, and called for government action to stimulatebusiness. Specifically, he suggested a major road-repairprogram to add to the employment rolls. Mr. Stempel is amonga group of business leaders who meet with Commerce SecretaryRobert Mosbacher in Washington today.   But Mr. Stempel said GM doesn't plan to eliminate amarketing division, such as the troubled Oldsmobile brand,and would be loath to further reduce the company'scommon-stock dividend.   &quot;We will treat that with extreme care,&quot; said Mr. Stempel.&quot;There are a lot of things we will do before cutting thedividend&quot; again. In February, the company cut its dividend to40 cents a share quarterly from 75 cents.   Mr. Stempel outlined several other, less drasticcost-cutting moves. GM will shut down its North Americanoperations for two weeks in July, and ask workers to takevacations then. Ford currently does this. Mr. Stempel,however, said the UAW has so far refused to tell its GMmembers to use vacation time during the shutdown, rather thancollecting company-paid unemployment benefits and vacationingat some other time.   GM won't pay a $600 per person Christmas bonus to salariedemployees next year, and will reduce company contributions toan employee stock purchase program. As expected, most seniorGM executives won't receive stock bonuses for 1991. GM alsowill cut back on advertising budgets, travel and meetings,Mr. Stempel said.   Reaction on Wall Street was mixed. GM common stock easedin heavy trading on the New York Stock Exchange to $27.75,down 12.5 cents and close to its recent fouryear low of$27.625. Securities analysts peppered GM executives withquestions during a midafternoon briefing, and were stilldigesting the announcement when the New York markets closed.   &quot;I tend to think this is a significant positive,&quot; saidLehman Brothers analyst Joseph Phillippi. &quot;GM has finallyfaced up to the fact they have to downsize themselves.&quot;   Still, Mr. Stempel didn't follow the lead of IBM and orderoutright dismissals of salaried staff. In fact, he said GMprobably will accomplish its white-collar cuts with earlyretirement offers instead of firings. &quot;I thought they wouldhave been more aggressive&quot; on job cuts, said Smith Barney,Harris Upham analyst Wendy Needham.   But Ms. Needham said overall, GM's moves should be goodfor the No. 1 auto maker and its rivals. &quot;If GM is operatingat 100% in 1993, it means pricing and profitability&quot; willimprove for Chrysler, Ford Motor Co. and others, she said.   Some analysts, however, expressed concern that GM iscutting new product spending in ways that could leave thecompany short of fresh models in the 1995 to 1996 period. GMsaid it will cut capital spending a total of $1.1 billion, or8%, from the previously planned $14.1 billion, in 1992 and1993. But Mr. Stempel insisted that the cuts won't meaneliminating major new products.   Inside GM, employees were left almost as uncertain abouttheir futures as they were before yesterday's announcement.   &quot;We're extremely concerned because we're not a coreautomobile plant,&quot; said Denny Lanane, a UAW worker at aGM-Delco Remy division factory in Anderson, Ind. The factorymakes alternators and cranking motors for heavy trucks andequipment.   The shock waves from GM's announcement rippled beyond WallStreet, bringing reaction from a variety of quarters. U.S.Sen. Donald Riegle (D., Mich.) used the announcement to blastJapan. &quot;This is an economic Pearl Harbor,&quot; Sen. Riegledeclared.   But GM got somewhat surprising words of encouragement froma Japanese auto maker, Toyota Motor Corp. &quot;GM management hadto do what it believed to be best for the company,&quot; saidRobert McCurry, executive vice president of Toyota's U.S.sales arm. &quot;We certainly sympathize with the families ofthose GM employees who will be affected by today'sannouncement.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
