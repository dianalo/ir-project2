The Italian agricultural group said sales more than quadrupled, to 3.928 trillion lire ($2.98 billion) from 883.23 billion lire.    Group indebtedness stood at 1.214 trillion lire, while investments shot up to 2.59 trillion lire from 431 billion lire and expenses soared to 3.635 trillion lire from 833.5 billion lire due to several major acquisitions.    Raul Gardini, the group's president, said Ferruzzi will continue its expansion. &quot;We will keep on spending in order to grow,' he told yesterday's annual meeting of shareholders.    Already, Ferruzzi has sharply enlarged its operating arena since last March with a whirlwind series of domestic and international acquisitions that have surprisedItalian financial circles because of their massive scale and the alacrity with which they have been carried out.    One of Ferruzzi's boldest initiatives this year involved boosting its stake in the chemicals giant Montedison to about 40% from 28% through the acquisition for 320 billion lire of a majority share in the financial holding company Pafinvest and subsequent stock purchases on the open market. Many analysts expect Ferruzzi to seek majority control of Montedison.    Ferruzzi recently announced that it will make public offerings of $575 million on international markets over the next three years. </TEXT></DOC>
