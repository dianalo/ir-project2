But while the Dukakis camp was advising caution, a leader of theJesse Jackson campaign said the platform should call for taxincreases on the rich.   The 30-member platform committee, chaired by Michigan Gov. JamesJ. Blanchard, received its marching orders last month from partychairman Paul G. Kirk Jr., who wants a streamlined platform that``every Democratic candidate is going to be proud to stand upon'' _not one that provides ammunition for the GOP.   Blanchard said the platform must be ``hard-hitting, progressive,future-oriented, idealistic, readable and inspiring. If ourplatform is going to be taken seriously, it must not hide in themush of verbosity, buzz words or the easy promise.''   Walter Fauntroy, representing the Jackson campaign, exhorted theplatform-writers not to make ``the mistake of a generalized,against-sin and for-motherhood platform.''   ``There comes a time when the rubber's got to hit the road,''said Fauntroy, the District of Columbia's non-voting representativein Congress.   ``We need to call for tax increases'' on the wealthy, forfreezing military spending and for using pension funds to helprebuild America, Fauntroy said.   Barnes, a former congressman from Maryland who played a role indrafting the last three platforms, said the new one should ``helpto unite all Democrats (and) bring us a resounding victory inNovember.''   Rep. Mary Rose Oakar, D-Ohio, a co-chair of the committee, askedFauntroy, the Jackson representative, to provide the ``bottom-lineprinciples that (Jackson) feels must be in the platform.''   Fauntroy promised to provide such a list.   Lawmakers, lobbyists, mayors, labor and civil rights leadersurged the party not to gloss over specific commitments to women'sissues, education spending, a tough stance on narcotics and othercauses.   Kristina Kiehl, chair of a pro-abortion rights political actioncommittee called Voters for Choice, said that with the RepublicanParty opposed to abortion, it is imperative for Democrats again toinclude ``a plank supporting reproductive freedom, includingabortion funding'' for the poor.   ``It has been suggested that our platform be a succinct,compelling statement of principles,'' she said. ``Let us be clear:it isn't the length of the document that will move people. ... Itis the degree of commitment to those principles.''   House Speaker Jim Wright of Texas, the leadoff witness, said:``We've had a challenge from our chairman to keep it short, andever since that time people have been running from the word`short.' So we use other words: brief, concise, compact, terse,round and firm and fully packed and all those kinds of things.''   Wright said the Democrats must articulate a vision for thefuture repudiating Reagan administration policies that he said havebrought ``downward mobility'' to families struggling to own homesor send children to college.   The platform committee will hold a hearing Friday in Norfolk,Va., on defense and foreign policy. Other forums will be held on:families, in Columbus, Ohio, on May 19; young Americans, on May 26in Austin, Texas; jobs, on June 2 in both Los Angeles and Detroit,and new leaders, at a time and place to be determined.   A 15-member drafting committee will huddle on Mackinac Island,Mich., June 9-13 to produce a draft. The full committee will takeup the final document later in June, several weeks before the partyconvention opens in Atlanta on July 18.   The convention delegates will pass judgment on the platform onJuly 19.</TEXT></DOC>
