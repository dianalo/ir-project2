 Youcan certainly look at the different applications and know fairly quicklywhich ones you should be applying this technology to if you're going to.andM;In some cases, you have a high volume of transactions and frequent retrievalof documents; for example, new account applications is one of the ones we'relooking at.andP;  It's a very people-intensive thing, processing one of thesedocuments and doing data entry from a document.andM;And then, of course, it's passed on to different departments for furtherprocessing.andP;  Since you actually generate these forms initially and send themout after a phone call from the customer, you could put some control numbersor bar coding on that form and integrate it with the dp and then maybe dodata entry from the image.andM;On Integrating Image and ISandM;SystemsandM;We see three basic constraints in trying to integrate the imaging system withthe mainframe.andP;  This is the USA check-rendering application, where basicallywhat we want to do is replace checks with images.andM;First of all, we'd like to use the storage on the mainframe, mainly becausewe'd like to print these things on the mainframe.andP;  And the [IBM] 3800 printerjust doesn't have the horsepower to print images in the way that we want toprint them.andP;  The problem is that the 3800 is rated at about 210 pages perminute.andP;  So that means probably about 150 pages per minute of images.andP;  Theissue being that the printer cycles down mechanically while it's building thepage, and whenever you cycle down on a 3800 on every page, you'll getthroughput a small fraction of the rated speed.andP;  In some cases, if you'rewilling to compromise resolution, you can get close to rated speed, but ourapplications demand high-quality images; therefore, we're at the other end ofthe scale.andP;  For example, one application we looked at got about 29 pages perminute.andM;The other constraint is the time it takes to decompress an image on themainframe.andP;  It's outrageous; you wouldn't be able to keep the printerprinting.andP;  You'd have to decompress ahead of time for the 3800, which meansyou're going to need a lot of storage for that also.andM;Another way around this, of course, would be to go with a sheet-fed Xeroxprinter.andP;  But, unfortunately, the requirements are that we go with acontinuous-feed printer.andP;  Most of these printers that you hear doing imagesat high speeds are generally sheet-fed printers.andM;There are several alternatives, but maybe the distributed approach is theeasiest.andP;  Here we have these huge files with all these special requirements,just totally foreign to the dp environment.andP;  Maybe we should take them out ofthere and just send the data back to the mainframe.andM;On Using Image To Generate PaperandM;We search for collateral loans; the customer comes to us and we charge adollar a page for each.andP;  So the more paper we can give them, the better.andP;  Ourproblem was we couldn't [produce] enough paper.andM;So our ROI was such that we had 300 or 400 reels of microfilm and peoplewould have to look through them, based on the sequential age of documents,and were trying to create paper.andP;  And the sale of the paper paid for thesystem.andM;On Integrating FileNet and PrimeandM;We had a Prime minicomputer that had an indexing system on it, which we hadspent a lot of money and time developing.andP;  So, when we went to the FileNetsystem on the back end for imaging, we had to develop our own gateway betweenthe two systems to validate when something's scanned in, because they have torun in sync.andM;It's already been indexed on the Prime side, so we then scan it into theFileNet side; this cross-checking goes on automatically.andP;  And then anexception report shows up of documents that have not been indexed.andM;One of the benefits we did find with using this approach [was in converting]the original index that is on the Prime from a card file.andP;  There were about 3million debtors on that file.andP;  They were in tub files and, if someone lostthe card, or misfiled the card when it was keyed in, our system would show norecord.andP;  And when we started converting the documents that were active on thesystem, we came up with exception reports.andP;  We had documents with no index,and we were able to correct those data errors and straighten out our system.andM;On Cost-JustificationandM;The only thing that we've done to date was to sit down and creatework-to-time relationships and track that piece of paper from its inceptionthrough the whole work flow and develop its productivity and utilization.andP;  Ifyou live with that as a tool on a daily, weekly, monthly basis, whatever thecycle is for the product that you're possibly going to automate, you havesome basis point to refer back to that there are definite steps that will beeliminated.andM;So these are known to us already, that if we go optical, this set of stepswill be eliminated.andP;  Forget the manpower reductions.andP;  Forget the paperreductions.andP;  Just the time savings in flow is drastically increased and thatrelates to real dollars.andM;That might not be enough to justify a system, but, in our case, we're lookingat some very widely used applications, so there are a lot of steps alongtheir paths that are eliminated.andP;  So, from day one, there should be a gooddollar payback for the system or systems that'll be put in place.andM;On Why the System Is NeededandM;There are parts of the dp entity that have been looking at possibly storingmore and more information on RDBMS, and accessing that through DASD files.andO;With the demands being placed more and more on micrographics, with paper andmicrofiche, they say, &quot;You've come up with an ultimate solution to this pointin time, making it cheap, but what's the next step?andP;  What's more easilyaccessible, cheaper?&quot;andM;But it's popping up basically with the users, who have been working withfiche and paper, saying, &quot;Hey, you know, I've had enough now.andP;  Give mesomething else that's going to make life easier.&quot;andP;  And they're all acclimatedto using crts, so they want to see it through their screens.andM;On How the System OriginatedandM;The client account system department is responsible for its own recordsmanagement.andP;  We do that right now on updatable microfiche.andP;  Some years ago,it became clear that that would be a problem to handle in the future.andP;  So Istarted, with the help of an outside consultant, to look for a solution forthat problem.andM;Actually, the user decided himself to buy the system.andP;  They [users] wereasking for a solution because already the clients' systems are very muchautomated and they were asking, &quot;Why do we still have to handle those largeamounts of paper?andP;  Please come up with a solution.&quot;andM;On Cost-JustificationandM;With the new system we don't have to expand in personnel in the next two orthree years.andP;  And another cost-justification was to get rid of the oldsystem, the updatable microfiche, [because] the microfiche cost a lot ofmoney.andP;  But [these] won't amount up to the total sum that you have investedin your new system.andM;You can prove the hard dollar to death, but improvement of client services isvery important to us, as we won last year's award for most client-orientedcompany in Holland.andP;  What we would like to do with the new system isintegrate data and image so that client services are improved in that way.andO;Another important issue is high productivity with processing the documents.andM;On the Psychological Impact ofandM;ImagingandM;Now, everybody spends the bulk of their day working at some type of videodisplay terminal.andP;  The situation, though, that we'll have with imagingcapabilities presents a new psychological problem.andP;  And that is thedependency on the displayed information versus the tangible, feely-touchypaper document that they can have a physical interaction with and, therefore,achieve some sense of security with the accuracy of that information and whatthey're actually interpreting from that document.andP;  That's one of the thingswe're trying to be very cautious with in developing our application rightnow.andM;On the Impact on Work FlowandM;We did a workflow analysis of the claims processing flow as it exists today,and the claims processing flow as it would exist with an image system andthere were basically no differences.andP;  What does change, though, is that theline that connects the boxes on the diagrams is now electronic, versussomebody shuffling down the hall with an armful of paper.andP;  So if you were tolook at it in terms of time frame from start to finish, obviously it would bemuch shorter.andM;[DATAMATION asks: &quot;But, would one of the possible benefits that you perceivebe to use the system to route exception cases to the people with the focusedtalent to process them?andP;  And do you think that by monitoring the systemelectronically, you'd be aware of how many claims are sitting on thedifferent peoples' desks, so that those claims might sit on peoples' desksfor less time than on a paper-based system?]andM;It's the same process with paper; you route the physical paper to that higherlevel of review, as opposed to moving that image to that person.andP;  But they[exception claims] will sit there for less time simply because they'll getthere quicker.andP;  And, hopefully, they'll be in a format that's a little moreefficient to handle.andM;But in terms of controlling backlogs, for example, you have a backlog sizethat's optimum that you want to manage to.andP;  It's not zero.andP;  It's somethingbesides zero.andM;On Organizing the ImplementationandM;The organizational structure at Upjohn has both the document managment peopleand the MIS people reporting to the same vp, so that kind of minimizes anypolitical problems that you may have from an organizational standpoint.andO;Plus, we tend to use a project team approach, so you have the end user, thedocument management experts, the MIS people, and the telecommunicationspeople all working together.andM;The way we put it is look at your paycheck.andP;  If we all have the samesignature at the bottom, then we sould all be striving to optimize what thecompany is trying to do, rather than what each department is trying to do.andM;On Document ConversionandM;People tend to underestimate the effort it takes to change the form of thedocument.andP;  You have to scan it, index it, and make sure that the image is ofquality, that you haven't picked up any garbage, because nothing'serror-free.andP;  And that's all adding time.andM;You've got an additional cost for every time you touch information or convertit.andP;  We will be going through the document conversion process in the nextthree or four months and that is probably at least 50% of our systems cost.andM;On Image and IS SystemandM;InteroperabilityandM;There are a number of issues aside from just pure standards that have to belooked at for interoperability.andP;  If, generically, you could say we're notgoing to implement a system unless you provide everything according to an OSIstandard, it would be nice.andP;  But that 's not always practical, particularlyin optical technology when you have no hope in the near future of standardsin the way you write or read to the media.andM;Interoperability includes evaluating a vendor's proposal against yourembedded base of equipment.andP;  And literally within ATandamp;T, for example, thereare tens of thousands of PCs within the corporation.andP;  What is the impact ofimplementing an application that involves optical technology and imagetransfer to the embedded base of equipment?andP;  Do I have to upgrade PCs becausethey're not powerful enough cpu-wise?andM;On Adding Image Data to aandM;NetworkandM;If you are attempting real-time retrieval on an existing network where youare not doing that type of traffic handling today, you're in big trouble,because somebody's going to get shortchanged.andP;  And that's probably going tobe the small transaction users and the voice users because, when you starttransmitting large blocks of data, you're going to tie up that network.andM;There are certainly technologies on the way, including ISDN and switch packetnetworks and FDDI that will somewhat mitigate that problem and turn over thetraffic engineering to a common carrier rather than the end user, where youpay for what you need and you expect the capability to be there when you needit.andM;On Soft BenefitsandM;As a member of probably the world's largest nonprofit organization, you know,we base our justifications on soft benefits most of the time.andP;  the way youjustify something in the Department of Defense is how it affects the missionand national readiness and that sort of thing.andM;As far as getting towards some of the hard benefits like reducing manpowerand cutting costs, we're always looking towards that, but, like everybodyelse, we have just as hard a time trying to figure those out and measurethem.andM;On Manipulating the Image andandM;DataandM;Just the image by itself or just the text or data by itself is not as useful.andO;One particular application I'm thinking of is when action officers respond toa crisis situation, whether it be a military crisis or a humanitarian-typesupport thing.andP;  They have to put together decision packages for the admiralsand generals and whoever in real quick order.andM;And one of the things they said that would really benefit them would be to beable to cut and paste between images and text.andP;  They can go in there in ourparticular system, do a query based on a full-text retrieval, pull it up,there'd be an image associated with that and then cut-and-paste with that,then hand the guy one piece of paper that synopsizes all of the things heneeds to know to make a decision.andM;On IS and Image TechnologyandM;I think several of us [on this panel] are MIS, or what would be called MISwithin our organization.andP;  And maybe that's a recognition that MIS is startingto look at image.andP;  I know several other companies on Long Island that areworking very aggressively to put in image systems, and MIS is leading theway, or at least as involved as the end users who are pushing the technology.andM;On Image Throughput AnalysisandM;Determining the system bottleneck is very important.andP;  and, in the image arenait becomes even more crucial, I think, because of the size of the data thatmust be moved around.andP;  I'm  certainly skeptical of an architecture [for imageprocessing] that is cpu-based, where it's interrupt-driven.andP;  I'll give you anexample: DEC.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
