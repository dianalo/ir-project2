Therefore, he felt that the Strategic Arms Reductions Talks (START)going on in Geneva at the time could have a decisive impact on US securitybecause they involve the strategic arms relationship between the US andUSSR. He notes that US security requires not more missiles, not morewarheads on missiles, but arms control policies that will discouragethe USSR from deploying more weapons that increase the threat to theUS and its allies. He sees a foreign policy designed to forgo unnecessarymilitary advantages as dampening the arms race between the superpowersand therefore more successful in improving US security. He elaboratesunder the following topics: the START proposals; assessing the proposals;and a better way to START.</TEXT></DOC>
