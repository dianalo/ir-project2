The court, without comment, turned away arguments that governmentdefense lawyers never may be sued for civil damages based on whatthey do for their public client in a case.   Nineteen Chicago police officers sued the city and variousofficials in 1984, alleging discrimination in employment.   James Montgomery, then the city's corporation counsel, and DonaldHubert, one of Montgomery's top assistants, represented Chicago inthe case.   They were named as defendants in a subsequent lawsuit. It allegesthat Montgomery and Hubert violated the federal Fair CreditReporting Act by hiring an investigative firm to obtain throughfalse pretenses credit reports on the police officers who had suedthe city.   The suit against Montgomery and Hubert alleges that they intendedto use the information to embarrass and intimidate the officers.   Montgomery and Hubert sought to have the lawsuit against themdismissed. They said they are entitled to absolute immunity fromcivil liability because the alleged misconduct occurred as part oftheir representing Chicago in the job-discrimination suits.   U.S. District Judge Harry Leinenweber refused to dismiss thesuit, and the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld his rulinglast Oct. 21.   The appeals court said that because the alleged misconduct wasinvestigatory in nature, and allegedly occurred outside federalrules, it was ``removed from the judicial process and (is) not afunction that rests uniquely within the duties of an advocate.''   Throughout most of its opinion, the appeals court seemed toacknowledge that government defense lawyers are entitled to the sameabsolute immunity from civil lawsuits afforded governmentprosecutors.   But in concluding, the appeals court said, ``We express noopinion on whether, under similar circumstances, the uniquefunctions performed by prosecuting attorneys would entitle them togreater immunity than afforded government defense counsel.''   In the appeal acted on today, Chicago Corporation Counsel JudsonH. Miner represented Montgomery and Hubert. He said the appealscourt ruling ``is a dangerous narrowing of immunity (that) willdamage, rather than promote, the public concerns that gave rise tothe doctrine of absolute immunity for public attorneys.''   Miner added, ``This is the first case to deny government defenseattorneys absolute immunity for conduct alleged to have beenundertaken in the course of representing their public client.''   The case is Montgomery vs. Auriemma, 88-1439.</TEXT></DOC>
