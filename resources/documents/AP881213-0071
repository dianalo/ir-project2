The report has been sent to the White House, which was to send itto the House and Senate Armed Services committees later this week.But administration source said the committees may not get it untillater.   Congressional and administrative sources described someprovisions of the ``2010 Report'' _ which looks to the year 2010 _on condition of anonymity. Accounts of the report appeared over theweekend and on Monday in The Washington Post and the Los AngelesTimes.   The plan would organize many weapons activities around theprincipal nuclear material involved, eventually concentrating allplutonium processing at the Idaho National Engineering Laboratorynear Idaho Falls, uranium activities at Oak Ridge, Tenn., andtritium activities at the Savannah River Plant near Aiken, S.C.,congressional sources said.   This would mean closing the Rocky Flats plant near Denver, whichmakes plutonium triggers for thermonuclear weapons powered bytritium, and the Feed Materials Production Center near Fernald,Ohio., a uranium foundry, according to the report.   The Rocky Flats plant is closed for cleanup inside one of itsbuildings because of accidental contamination of three employees inOctober. The Savannah River tritium reactors are temporarily closedto upgrade safety equipment and procedures.   Doug Elmets, press secretary for the department, declined tocomment on the report.   The department's $6.8 billion plan to replace its tritiumreactors, released last summer, called for a new Savannah Riverreactor and only one Idaho reactor, though the Idaho reactor was ofa ``modular'' design that could be reproduced easily.   Both new designs could produce either tritium or plutonium,according to the design of the uranium fuel they are loaded with. Toproduce tritium, lithium is added to fuel assemblies.   Tritium decays fairly rapidly _ 5.5 percent of any startingamount turns into inert helium in a year _ and must be replenishedin nuclear weapons from time to time. Supply figures are secret. Nosuch replenishment is needed of uranium and plutonium components,which frequently are recycled into new weapons when old ones areretired.   One congressional source said the department was faced with achoice of where to put the plutonium site, Idaho Falls or theHanford Nuclear Reservation near Richland, Wash., and it chose Idahobecause of growing opposition in the Richland area and the severityof contamination there.   An administration source said the Energy Department had notchanged its estimate that $110 billion would be needed over the next40 years to repair environmental damage at the 17 factories andlaboratories in 12 states involved in manufacturing nuclear weaponsand components.</TEXT></DOC>
