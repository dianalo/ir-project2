ANDREWS</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Federal Trade Commission is under ordersfrom a House panel to investigate whether the tobacco industry iswaging an illegal ``scorched earth'' campaign of economicretaliation against corporate opponents of smoking.   Rep. Thomas A. Luken, D-Ohio, chairman of a House Energy andCommerce subcommittee, instructed FTC Chairman Daniel Oliver at ahearing Wednesday to examine whether tobacco companies are engagedin illegal boycotts, ``whether real or threatened,'' againstbusinesses that prohibit smoking.   Luken referred to RJR Nabisco Inc., which fired the advertisingfirm that handled the announcement by another client, NorthwestAirlines, that it would prohibit smoking on all domestic flightsexcept to Hawaii starting April 23.   The ad firm, Saatchi andamp; Saatchi DFS Inc., had been producing adsfor Nabisco cookies for 12 years and for Life Savers candy, anotherproduct of the tobacco and food conglomerate, for 18 years. RJRNabisco cited ``philosophical differences'' in firing the agency.   ``The scorched earth efforts by conglomeration tobacco companiesto hit back at those who restrict smoking and to use the economicpower of their non-tobacco components to effort their will arechilling and depressing,'' Luken said.   ``If the parent companies, with tobacco and non-tobaccosubsidiaries, use tactics of intimidation and threats against thosewho oppose smoking, the FTC should be alerted,'' he said. ``It isthe FTC's job to be aware of boycotts, whether real or threatened,and to examine their legality.''   Charles O. Whitley, a senior consultant for the TobaccoInstitute, the industry's trade association, said ``there is noevidence of any collusion'' among the six major tobaccomanufacturers to take economic reprisals against Northwest Airlinesor any other business.   But Whitley said tobacco companies will take any lawful stepsnecessary to protect themselves and their customers againstcorporate discrimination.   Whitley said the Tobacco Institute had not taken a position ondraft legislation proposed by Luken and Rep. Bob Whittaker, R-Kan.,to allow states to require tougher health warnings on cigarettepacks and advertising than those required under federal law.   Major health organizations, including the American LungAssociation, the American Cancer Society and the American HeartAssociation, endorsed the measure at the hearing.   Their spokesmen accused the tobacco industry of making falseadvertising claims that low-tar cigarettes are safer to smoke thanothers. ``The only safe cigarette is no cigarette,'' said Scott D.Ballin, vice president of the heart association.   The Luken-Whittaker bill also would allow smokers and theirfamilies to sue tobacco companies for damages on the ground thatdeceptive cigarette advertising resulted in serious injury or death.   The measure seeks to nullify recent appeals court rulingsfavoring cigarette manufacturers who argued thatgovernment-required warning labels protect them from legal claimsthat they failed to warn the public of the hazards of smoking.   The bill would require the Federal Trade Commission to contractwith a government or private laboratory unrelated to the tobaccoindustry to conduct annual studies of the chemicals contained inmajor cigarette brands, including tar, nicotine, carbon monoxide,ammonia, cyanide, formaldehyde and radioactive compounds.   The FTC closed its cigarette-testing laboratory in February 1987on budgetary grounds. The only testing is performed by a tobaccoindustry laboratory which is monitored by the FTC and usesFTC-approved methods.</TEXT></DOC>
