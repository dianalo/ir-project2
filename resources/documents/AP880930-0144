President Reagan denied the report by The Nation, a 1-month-oldEnglish-language weekly.   ``We are not negotiating directly with Iran. We have not talkedto the kidnappers. I think maybe Iran is putting these storiesout,'' Reagan said in Chicago.   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, on the presidentialplane en route to Chicago, left open the possibility that a thirdparty was holding talks with Iran in an effort to release thehostages.   The report, which quoted unidentified sources in Geneva, saidfive American hostages held by Lebanese Shiites would be releasedwith Iran's help about Oct. 7. A second group of hostages,including three Americans and a Briton, possibly Anglican clergymanTerry Waite, would be released a week later, the paper said.   It said that in return, the United States promised economic aid,renewal of arms sales, the release of billions of dollars of frozenIranian assets in U.S. banks and resumption of diplomatic relations.   But the report said arms sales would be renewed only after thehostages were released, to avoid creating the impression of an``arms for hostages'' deal.   Fitzwater told reporters, ``I don't deny that there are peopletalking to Iran about the hostages, but no U.S. officials aretalking to them. There is no one authorized to make a deal forhostages or do anything that is contrary to our policy.''   Hesh Kestin, the managing editor of The Nation, stood by thestory.   ``I don't think a story is true or false because Washingtondenies it,'' Kestin said. ``Washington has denied many stories and,lo and behold, it eventually turns out that they're true.''   Many news stories in the Middle East and elsewhere have saidthat a hostage release is imminent, but the stories have not provedaccurate.   Seventeen foreign hostages are believed held in Lebanon,including nine Americans. Terry Anderson, the chief Middle Eastcorrespondent of The Associated Press, is the longest held hostage.He was kidnapped March 16, 1985.   The newspaper report said the U.S. put aside its demand thatTeheran release Marine Lt. Col. William Higgins, one of the nineAmericans, because officials were convinced Iran does not controlthe kidnappers holding him.   The Iranians said they knew only that Higgins was spirited awayon a fishing boat off the Lebanese port of Tyre and transferred toa larger ship at sea, the newspaper said.   The Nation said the United States turned down the pro-IranianIslamic Jihad group's demand for $3 million in ransom for thehostages.   The paper also said Iranian commander-in-chief HashemiRafsanjani escaped an assassination attempt last week as he wasbeing driven back from the parliament in Tehran. Four of hisbodyguards were killed in the ambush, the paper said.   The report could not be confirmed.</TEXT></DOC>
