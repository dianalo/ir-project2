But there hasalways been reason to hope that the institution might fulfillits original, admirable mandate. Its role as a forum foropposition to Saddam Hussein during the Iraq war suggestedthat perhaps now some progress toward this end would bepossible. Now comes news that the U.N. may be getting readyto take up the defense of Aung San Suu Kyi, the brave Burmesedemocrat who was just awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.   Burma's military junta has held Aung San Suu Kyi underhouse arrest for more than two years. Readers will recallthat after the Burmese dictatorship consented to hold anelection in 1989, probably believing that nothing would comefrom a nation with nearly 100 political parties, Suu Kyi'sNational League for Democracy won 80% of the contested seats.The shocked ruling military council promptly returned Burma'speople to government by dictatorship.</LP><TEXT>   Oslo gave Suu Kyi the Peace Prize last month, but that hasfailed to move Major General Tin U, the dictator who recentlymused that his team would rule 40 million Burmese for&quot;another five years or 10.&quot; Suu Kyi's crime was protestingthe &quot;Burmese way of socialism,&quot; which produced a massacre ofthe population whose toll far exceeded that of TiananmenSquare. This week the Burmese government turned down theNobel Committee's request to visit Suu Kyi.   The U.N. resolution has been sponsored by Sweden, and isscheduled for consideration by the General Assembly soon. Itis couched in the careful language of diplomacy. &quot;Welcomingthe Secretary General's statement on the award of the NobelPeace Prize to Aung Sang Suu Kyi and his repeated appeals forher early release from house arrest,&quot; a draft &quot;expresses itsconcern at the information on the grave human rightssituation and stresses the need for an early improvement ofthe situation.&quot;   Even this soft language is a change for the UnitedNations. Until now the body has relegated the problem ofBurma's appalling regime to a dialogue between Burma andother countries. In backing Burma's most notable dissident,the body would show Burma that its government is one thatinternational public opinion cannot tolerate. (China, Burma'smain supplier of arms, has already announced its opposition.)   Significantly, the Swedes believe that the resolution willreceive important support from both Western and developingcountries and stands a good chance of passing. That wouldindicate a welcome shift of attitude by the 100-oddnon-aligned members of the 166-member U.N. Over the years,the West has come to expect little of substance from thisbody on basic matters relating to democracy and freedom. Thiswould be an appropriate opportunity for the U.N. to displaysupport for a beleaguered democrat.   In a collection of Suu Kyi's writings that has just beenpublished in the U.S. by Penguin Books, she says: &quot;In Burma,distanced by several decades of isolationism from politicaland intellectual developments in the outside world, thepeople have had to draw on their own resources to explode thetwin myths of their unfitness for political responsibilityand the unsuitability of democracy for their society.&quot; With avote, the U.N. now has the chance to add its resources to theaspirations of Burma's people.</TEXT></DOC>
