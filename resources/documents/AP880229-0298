The court, without comment, let stand a federal law thateffectively spared the government from having to defend itselfagainst claims seeking billions of dollars.   In another case, the court asked the Reagan administration forits opinion of a ruling that states indirectly may tax interestpaid to financial institutions from investments in Federal HomeLoan Bank (FHLB) bonds.   The court said it wants to hear from Justice Department lawyersbefore saying whether it will review fully a challenge to aMaryland bank franchise tax.   In other cases dealing with economic or business-related issues,the court:   _Agreed to decide whether the U.S. Customs Service may forceapplicants for drug enforcement jobs to be tested for drugs. Afederal workers union challenged the tests, calling the taking ofurine samples from employees a humiliating invasion of privacy.   _Let stand rulings that warrantless searches of Illinoisracetrack employees' on-grounds living quarters violateconstitutionally protected privacy rights.   _Said it will decide whether employees of a Pentagonintelligence agency are entitled to administrative hearings whenthe government fires them as security risks.   _Agreed to consider letting the federal government applyretroactively a formula that limits reimbursement paid to hospitalstreating Medicare patients. The court said it will hear Reaganadministraion arguments that some hospitals could reap a windfallfrom the ban on retroactive application of the formula.   _Asked the Reagan administration whether it thinks high-stakesbingo games run by Indian tribes are subject to state sales taxes.The court said it wants to hear from Justice Department lawyersbefore it says whether it will review an attempt by Oklahomaofficials to tax revenue from a bingo game in Tulsa run by theMuscogee Creek Nation.   The atmospheric nuclear tests that gave rise to the caseinvolving the government and federal contractors took place betweenthe closing days of World War II and the adoption of a treatybetween the United States and the Soviet Union in 1963 banningopen-air testing.   Suits were filed on behalf of 29 people _ civilians and membersof the military _ including 26 who died from cancer orcancer-related causes. The suits alleged that the health problemswere caused by radioactive fallout from the explosions.   Charged with negligence were the University of California, whichoperated the Los Alamos, N.M., project; Lawrence Livermorelaboratories, which helped develop the atomic bomb; Sandia Corp.,which provided engineering for the weapons program; and ReynoldsElectric Engineering Co., which helped build and operate a testsite in Nevada.   The suits accused the private contractors of failing to takeadequate safety precautions at the test sites, and also said thegovernment was responsible for failing to enforce its own safetystandards.   If the suits were successful, the government ultimately wouldpay the claims because it had insured the private contractors forany losses.   But in 1984 Congress passed a law supported by the Reaganadministration that says only the U.S. government may be sued fornegligence allegedly caused by a private contractor in the atomicweapons testing program.   The result was to bar the claims since the government is immunefrom such suits unless it surrenders immunity under the existingFederal Tort Claims Act.   In the FHLB bond interest case, the Maryland National Bankchallenged the tax, seeking a refund of $197,310 it paid underprotest to the state for the years 1979 through 1982.   During that period, the bank reported $2.82 million in interestfrom FHLB bonds.   The sum was included in the bank's earnings that were subject toMaryland's franchise tax, which is imposed on financialinstitutions for the privilege of doing business in Maryland.   The difficulty over whether earnings from FHLB bonds are taxablearises because of two apparently conflicting federal laws.   The 1932 law that created the FHLB generally exempts the bondsfrom taxes.   But a law enacted in 1862 permits states to levy a``non-discriminatory franchise tax'' on ``stocks and obligations ofthe United States government'' that generally are exempt from stateand local taxes.   The Maryland Court of Appeals upheld the state franchise tax,ruling in October that the 1862 law takes precedence.</TEXT></DOC>
