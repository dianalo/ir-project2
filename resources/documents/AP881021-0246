It could be anaberration, but if it isn't, it is worth watching.   This is it:   The civilian jobless rate fell from 5.6 percent in August to 5.4percent in September, a move that at first glance might suggest theeconomy was overheating.   Overheating in this sense generally refers to two factors: Therate of industrial production and the unemployment rate.   As industrial production reaches capacity it means the leastproductive plants are brought into service, thus forcing up costs.And as the jobless rate falls it means a tighter labor pool,perhaps leading to wage increases.   This time, however, the falling jobless rate did not suggestupward pressure on wages. In fact, there has been littleinflationary pressure from wages all year long. But it did scare upa ghost that might require equal vigilance.   The situation is described in Commissioner Janet L. Norwood'sstatement to the Joint Economic Committee of Congress on Oct. 7:   ``A large portion of the overall payroll employment increase _nearly 40 percent _ was in state and local government, reflecting astronger than usual expansion in public school jobs at thebeginning of the new school year.   ``In contrast, the private sector, which grew strongly earlierin the year, exhibited relatively small gains.''   That situation offers what could be good news and bad.   The good news is that no further inflationary pressure wasplaced on the economy by a tightening of labor supplies in theprivate sector. The bad news is that government employment, whichcan be very expensive, may be growing.   Further figures are necessary to confirm the Septemberexperience as a trend, but many analysts will be keeping an eye onit. Less than a decade ago, you may recall, many state and localgovernments were in bad financial shape.   Controlling employment always has been one of the most difficulttasks of government at all levels, in part because it takesmanpower to cut manpower. This is bureaucracy; like individuals, itputs on weight while trying to diet.   The rise still might turn out to be insignificant. It could benothing more than a methodological miscue. Moreover, there was somevery good news in the October report, that is, less inflationarypressure on industry.   That latter conclusion comes from a glance at the employmentbreakdown, which shows the private sector had relatively smallemployments gains, after growing strongly earlier in the year.   Private-sector business employment grew at an average rate ofonly 120,000 a month in August and September, compared with morethan 300,000 a month during the first seven months of the year.   In short, the supply of workers was barely tapped in those twomonths, which means that little further inflationary pressure wasadded. At the same time, workers managed to keep their jobs,another desirable outcome.   But that big increase in state and local government workerscould be a source of future problems, especially in regard to taxesand budgets.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv PMs Mon Oct. 24</NOTE></DOC>
