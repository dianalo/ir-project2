North.   Walsh filed a memorandum under seal in U.S. District Court insupport of his motion of last Thursday to dismiss the two centralcounts. The charges that would be dropped allege that North andthree co-defendants illegally diverted more than $14 million inU.S.-Iran arms-sale profits to the Nicaraguan rebels.   The memo was accompanied by declarations from Thornburgh andWalsh, the independent counsel said in a statement. The materialoutlines the position of the Reagan administration that, out ofconcern for national security, it cannot allow certain classifieddocuments to be disclosed at North's trial in support of Walsh'scase.   U.S. District Judge Gerhard Gesell refused to dismiss the twocounts on Monday, saying he first wanted an affidavit fromThornburgh detailing the administration's objections to releasingthe classified material contained in documents Walsh wanted to useto prosecute North.   On Dec. 12, Gesell said a substantial amount of classifiedmaterial must be disclosed in order to give North a fair trial,including the names of Central American countries where North wasinvolved in the secret resupply operation to the Contras.   Gesell also said that the ranks and duties of officials offoreign governments who appear in the classified documents must bedisclosed, although the judge permitted the names of the officialsto be deleted.   Gesell also insisted that CIA personnel be identified as workingfor the agency, although not by name, and that the text ofinformation obtained by intelligence be presented verbatim in mostinstances.   Last Thursday, Walsh moved to dismiss the conspiracy and theftcharges, citing North's ``insistence on introducing classifiedinformation in his defense'' and the Reagan administration's refusalto release material the judge ruled North would need at trial.   North is still confronted with 12 felony charges that carryprison terms totaling as much as 60 years.   These include obstructing various congressional and presidentialinquiries into the Iran-Contra affair by preparing false statementsand destroying documents.</TEXT></DOC>
