The reasons for this discrepancy are discussed. Atfirst a review of the present energy market is given. Then the utilizationof solar energy is treated, dealing with low-temperature collectors,high-temperature solar power plants, photovoltaic solar cells, and photochemicaland photobiological processes. The present technical and economic limitsof utilization are discussed. Solar energy will probably not be ableto contribute significantly to the energy supply in the following 10to 20 years. The situation may be different in 50 years but reliablepredictions are impossible.</TEXT></DOC>
