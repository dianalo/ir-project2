In a statement distributed by the Saudi Press Agency, Nazer saidagain that Saudi Arabia will not abide by its OPEC-decreedproduction quota unless the cartel's 12 other members adhered totheirs.   The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries has not beenable to defend its benchmark price of $18 per barrel because itsmember states have been violating their quotas.   OPEC is set to examine production quotas later this month andconsider increasing the output ceiling to halt violations.   Nazer said he hoped the ministerial meeting scheduled for Nov. 21in Vienna would lead to an agreement on ``a maximum price for aperiod of two or three years under the meticulous surpervision ofproduction and prescribed quotas to help remedy the disruption andstabilize the market in the interest of all.''   He did not suggest any figures.   ``We ... look forward with big hope that the forthcoming meetingof oil ministers of OPEC will produce clear, firm resolutions thatdefine production quotas and the ceiling,'' Nazer said.   He added: ``We are surprised at the insistence of some of theforeign media to pursue the campaign of distortion and incitementagainst the kingdom.''   He apparently referred to recent reports that Saudi Arabia's oilproduction had reached 7 million barrels a day when its daily quotawas set for 4.365 million barrels. Saudi Arabia is OPEC's largestoil exporter and the most powerful force in the cartel.   Nazer blamed the chaos in the oil market on ``non-adherence bysome member states in OPEC to the resolutions adopted by theorganization in Geneva December 1986'' on production and pricing.   ``We have repeatedly said and reaffirm today that the kingdom ofSaudi Arabia will be the first state to respect adherence to itsdefined quota on condition that all member states in OPEC abide bytheir quotas in a categoric and decisive manner,'' he said.   ``We categorically reject that the kingdom alone abide by itsquota while others exceed theirs.''</TEXT></DOC>
