The 1 billion figure means one of every five humans suffers fromdisease or malnutrition, WHO director-general Dr. Hiroshi Nakajimasaid Sunday, adding that the greatest burden of disease is in poorcountries of Africa, Asia and South America.   ``This is a preventable tragedy because the developed world hasthe resources and technology to end common diseases worldwide,'' hesaid in a statement accompanying a WHO report. ``The missingingredient is the will to help the developing countries.   ``The rich countries must transfer technology, health manpowerand money, because the poorest countries can't help themselves,''Nakajima said.   He said health expenditures in the poorest countries averageabout $5 per person, while in the United States, Canada, Japan andwestern Europe, health expenditures average about $400 a person.   Despite the gloomy picture, Nakajima said health care hasimproved enough n the last 40 years to raise human life expectancyfrom 41 to 59.7 years in the developing countries.   Accomplishments in recent decades include the eradication ofsmallpox and new measures to control river blindness, a major causeof blindness in tropical regions.   The last case of smallpox was reported in 1979. Eradicating thedisease has saved an estimated 20 million lives worldwide, the WHOsaid.   Aerial spraying for blackflies, which carry river blindness, hasprotected about 4 million children from the disease, the WHOestimates. A new drug is being distributed now to treat thosealready infected.   And by the year 2000, the WHO predicts the eradication of polio,a disease now striking about 208,000 children annually. Almost allthe victims are in developing countries.</TEXT></DOC>
