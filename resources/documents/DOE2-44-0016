The persistence of this bubble has resultedin a decline in field prices for gas, well below the replacement costlevels for new reserves. Consequently, exploration and development activitylevels have fallen to the point where the future ability of the gas industryto meet 1990s market requirements is in question. This paper reviewsthe natural gas supply and deliverability situation in the USA and assessesthe possibility of future gas shortages because of declining deliverability.A combination of market deregulation, high gas prices following the oilcrisis of the late 70s resulting in increased gas deliverability, anddecreased demand resulting from economic conditions and improved energyefficiency, brought about the gas bubble, and the recent collapse inworld oil/gas prices ensures its continuity at least in the short term.Reserve additions have tended to be less than production; recent additionsare more reliant on revisions and adjustments than new discoveries, andlow field prices mean there is little incentive for exploration and development.The largest gas producing areas of the USA show signs of the mature natureof the industry, with declining productive capacity. It is suggestedthat some form of deliverability shortage is imminent, with at leasttransitional shortages occurring in the early 1990s. Canadian importswill play an increasingly important role unless there is significant,sustained recovery in gas prices and drilling activity prior to the endof the bubble. 11 refs., 10 figs., 4 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
