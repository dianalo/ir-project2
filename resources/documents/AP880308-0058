In the fullest official account yet of the rioting againstChinese rule, the Chinese News Service today said more than 300police were injured in the rioting Saturday and Sunday in Lhasa.Previous official reports had said that one policeman was killedand 28 injured in a single day of rioting.   The fighting occurred in Lhasa at the Jokhang, Tibet's holiesttemple.   One Westerner in Lhasa, a Tibetan-speaking traveler, saidTibetans told him five Tibetans and three Chinese police werekilled in daylong violence Saturday, the last day of a major prayerfestival.   Another traveler, who arrived today Chengdu, 750 miles east ofLhasa, said officials told him two people were killed _ a Chinesepoliceman who was pushed off a roof and a Tibetan. Both travelersspoke on condition of anonymity.   The China News Service said 30 police officers were hospitalizedwith serious injuries and ``numerous'' civilians were hurt in theviolence _ the second nationalist riots in Lhasa since October.   In an eyewitness report seen in Hong Kong, the agency claimedthe disturbances were plotted by unidentified Tibetans who had bagsof rocks placed on top of buildings around the central Barkhormarketplace. It said Buddhist monks on Saturday poisoned tea givento officials and journalists, who had to be hospitalized. Thereport did not elaborate on their condition.   During the rioting, local government and Communist Partyofficials were forced to slide down ropes from a second-storyoffice in the Jokhang to escape enraged monks, said the account byreporter Geng Jun. He said the officials slid to safety just beforethe monks broke down the office door.   The report said ``some rioters set up barricades in Barkhormarketplace on Sunday morning and indiscriminately threw stonesthat injured numerous city residents.''   ``One monk stood up and started shouting for independence and hewas arrested,'' the Western traveler in Lhasa said by telephone.``The monks started throwing stones. The crowd just ran.''   He said authorities hustled him and other foreigners to theirhotels. But when he left his room a few hours later to get food, heencountered a clash in the square in front of the Johkang.   ``I found myself in the middle of a skirmish. Some tear gas wentoff near me. Twenty to 30 Tibetans were throwing stones at Chinesesoliders and the Chinese soldiers were throwing stones back.''   The traveler said the Chinese did not open fire. ``In thatsense, the Chinese were showing a lot of restraint.''   There have been no official figures given on arrests, butunconfirmed reports have said hundreds were rounded up.   Westerners in Lhasa said Johkang remained closed today butpolice on Monday stopped blocking entry to the Barkhor marketsquare. They said uniformed police had been replaced by dozens ofplainclothes officers who closely followed the few foreign touristsin town and would not allow them to take pictures.   William Tang, assistant foreign manager at the Lhasa Hotel, saidguests were being told they could go to the square but ``at theirown risk.''   The violence was the first in Lhasa since Oct. 1, when 2,000Tibetans led by monks burned down a police station facing JokhangTemple. Police opened fire, and at least 14 people were killed inthe battle.   The Dalai Lama, Tibet's exiled spiritual leader China blames forinstigating the riots, issued a statement from his office in NewDelhi on Monday saying ``the courage of the Tibetan people inexpressing, once again, their dissatisfaction against Chinese rulein spite of the obvious risk involved clearly reveal theirdesperation.''   The Dalai Lama, who fled following a failed uprising in 1959,also called on Tibetans to ``restrain from violence.''   China says Tibet has been part of the nation for centuries, andclaims it is making amends for past polices that suppressed Tibetancustoms and religion and destroyed many of their temples.   Antagonisms remain strong, however, between the Tibetans and theHans, China's ethnic majority who hold most of the top governmentposts in Lhasa.   The Western traveler said Tibetans told him police beat twomonks to death inside the Jokhang. Several Tibetans later carriedthe monks' bodies around the square, he said, triggering furtherclashes.</TEXT></DOC>
