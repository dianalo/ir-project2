A typical IRES will utilize two or more renewable energyresources in order to satisfy the energy and other needs of a community.One of the fundamental technical problems facing the designer of an IRESis to match the varying energy and power requirements of the loads withthe mostly stochastic characteristics of the resources in an appropriatemanner. The objective of this study is to formulate a mathematical modeland use it to develop a systematic approach to the design of an IRES.Two design approaches - one deterministic and the other probabilistic- are presented; they both have the following common elements: (1) categorizethe needs; (2) catalog the resources; (3) consider the variable natureof resources and load; and (4) find the ratings of different devicesand size of energy storage that will minimize the chosen performanceindex. In the deterministic approach, average values of resources andload variables are used. The approach employs a linear-programming techniquefor the design of integrated renewable energy systems. In the probabilisticapproach, a combination of deterministic and probabilistic models areused to model the energy resources and load demand. The probabilisticmodels are in the form of probability density and distribution functions.</TEXT></DOC>
