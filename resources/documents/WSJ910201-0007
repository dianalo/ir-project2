Althoughpolitical differences have kept them apart, South Africa'stwo most important black leaders share a lifelong hatred ofapartheid. That they now join hands is a hopeful sign thatapartheid may yet be replaced by genuine pluralism.   In an immediate sense, of course, their meeting was rootedin tragedy, the mostly tribal violence that has left 1,000people dead in the past six months. In their nine-hourmeeting the two men worked out an agreement that calls upontheir followers &quot;to cease all attacks against one another.&quot;Each recognizes the right of the other's organization toexist and to participate in politics. The two men pledged tomake a joint tour of all violence-prone areas.</LP><TEXT>   It was significant that Mr. Mandela called his counterpart&quot;Prince Buthelezi&quot; during their joint appearance. Mr.Buthelezi is a prince of the Zulu tribe, and head of theInkatha Freedom Party. Mr. Mandela, hero of the AfricanNational Congress, is a member of the royal family of theTembu tribe. These and other black tribes, as well as the twowhite tribes, Afrikaner and English, would have to bereconciled in any peaceful South African future.   Mr. Mandela and Mr. Buthelezi have also representeddifferent approaches in the fight against apartheid. Mr.Mandela refused to renounce violence, allied himself withapartheid foes including communists, and stuck by hisprinciples through 27 years in jail. Mr. Buthelezi turnedaway from such confrontation and tried to build politicalpower as chief of a Zulu homeland. The ANC attacked ChiefButhelezi as a &quot;collaborator,&quot; and he replied in his proudand prickly fashion. The jailed Mr. Mandela became the heroof the anti-apartheid movement at home and abroad.   Mr. Buthelezi opposed sanctions against South Africa'seconomy as likely to hurt blacks first. The ANC, by contrast,encouraged black students to boycott their classes,proclaiming &quot;Liberation Before Education.&quot; Some 40% of blacksdrop out of school by the fifth year.   As the Mandela-Buthelezi meeting suggests, the ANC is nowbecoming more flexible, perhaps because of its obviousweakness. It has failed to crush Mr. Buthelezi. A recruitingdrive is going poorly. Its support among white anti-apartheidactivists is weak. Perhaps the Western media will finallyrecognize that black opinion in South Africa isn't monolithicand that Mr. Buthelezi's ideas have a large, crediblefollowing.   This is not to deny that Mr. Mandela's heroism inparticular and the ANC confrontational tactics in particularplayed a central role in the ongoing demise of apartheid.President F.W. de Klerk is expected to call for a repeal ofremaining apartheid laws today. Last month's integration of33 public schools produced a charming quote from LouisePhilips, 11, when asked why she supported the admission ofblacks: &quot;So that there would be more nice people in thisschool.&quot;   The problems of South Africa remain legion. President deKlerk has to contend with white extremists. It is by no meansclear that Mr. Mandela and Mr. Buthelezi can control theirfollowers; the day after their meeting, eight people died ina clash between the ANC and Inkatha. While some trade tiesare resuming, the economic situation on the streets remainsbleak and foreign investment skittish.   Yet the Mandela-Buthelezi meeting may prove to behistoric. Those of us who've resisted Mr. Mandela'sdeification have wondered not about his opposition toapartheid but about his designs for what comes after. Themeeting gives reason to hope he can lead his movement and hisnation into an open and pluralist future.</TEXT></DOC>
