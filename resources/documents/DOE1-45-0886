<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-45-0886 </DOCNO><TEXT>The efficiency of the glove-bag method to limit exposure to asbestos duringremoval of asbestos pipe lagging from the Winton Place Elementary Schoolin Cincinnati, Ohio, was evaluated, Personal breathing-zone samples werecollected during the work and found to be significantly below the 2,000,000fibers per cubic meter (f/m{sup 3}) Occupational Safety and Health Administrationstandard in effect. Several sequential personal samples were taken. Duringremoval operations, one sample was 200,000 fibers per cubic centimeter,whereas the other 13 were well under half of this. Several recommendedpractices used are presented, including premisting of all lagging withamended water, wrapping all pipe with plastic prior to the start of removal,use of only properly designed bags for the task including ones speciallydesigned for working around large valves or fittings, starting with aclean empty bag at pipe interfaces with walls and ceilings, making cutson preformed lagging blocks at the joints to minimize fiber generation,use of long hoses on amended water sprayers to optimize wetting practices,use of a high-efficiency particulate air-filter vacuum to contain fibersand collapse the glove bag during bag removal, and removal of contaminatedtools in an inverted glove for transfer to the next glove bag. In general,the method proved useful in reducing worker exposure during asbestos-removaloperations. Other recommended work practices are cited.</TEXT></DOC>
