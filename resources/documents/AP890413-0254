A decision to unleash ATandamp;T, if it came, would be a major changein federal regulation of the telephone industry. ATandamp;T has alwaysbeen considered a ``dominant'' carrier that could crush itscompetition if not restrained, and it has been tightly regulated.   But ATandamp;T has said that since 1984, when it agreed under federalorder to shed local telephone companies, it no longer is thedominant force in the long-distance business.   Commissioner Patricia Diaz Dennis asked Wednesday for a broadlook at long-distance competition after the commission ordered ATandamp;Tto revise or stop offering its so-called Tariff 12 custom serviceplan for some major customers.   Dennis said she agreed with the FCC's order on Tariff 12, whichgives ATandamp;T 30 days to revise its plan, but that the commission hadnot addressed the larger issue of whether the long-distancemarketplace was competitive today.   ``It is the seminal issue in so many of the other issues we'velooked at,'' she said in an interview.   FCC Chairman Dennis Patrick agreed and asked his staff to find away to ``determine exactly what kind of competition ATandamp;T faces andthen regulate accordingly,'' Dennis said.   ATandamp;T spokesman Herb Linnen said that by agreeing to look atlong-distance competition ``this commission recognizes that theworld is changing and it needs to take a hard look at the realitiesthat face all those in the long-distance business ... rather thanshaping public policies on realities that were prevalent before1984.''   In its Tariff 12 order, the commission said it found the planwas not widely available to other customers, and therefore illegal.   But ATandamp;T will not have to stop serving its existing Tariff 12customers, which include the General Electric Co., Du Pont Co. andFord Motor Co. Instead, those customers can take service under thetariff until the deadline for revising or withdrawing the tariff.   The commission gave ATandamp;T 30 days to implement changes or dropthe tariff.   Tariff 12 integrates voice and data services into packages tomeet specific customer needs. Critics of Tariff 12 argue that ATandamp;Tis simply bundling basic phone services that are strictly regulatedby the FCC, adding in a network management provision and thenoffering the package to large customers at reduced rates.   The effect would be to possibly undercut competitor's prices.   But the commission found that ATandamp;T's basic phone services werenot ``like'' the integrated services offered under Tariff 12.Therefore, ATandamp;T, the commission said, was not offering price breaksto GE or DuPont, for example, for the same services it providesnon-Tariff 12 customers.   The commission also found that the Tariff 12 packages were``like'' each other, so ATandamp;T was not favoring one Tariff 12customer over another.   But it said some Tariff 12 provisions were unlawful because they``contained unreasonable geographic restrictions which deny serviceto similarly situated customers seeking `like' packages.''   One of ATandamp;T's main competitors, MCI Communications Corp., saidit found it ``inconceivable that the commission, having foundTariff 12 to be unlawful, is allowing these rates to remain ineffect while ATandamp;T develops new, and probably similarly unlawfulrates to replace them.''   When ATandamp;T resubmits the Tariff 12 plan for approval, the FCCsaid the company must state that the plan will be generallyavailable and that it eliminates any ``unreasonably specificlimitations on availability.''   ATandamp;T said it was pleased with the order.   ``Today's FCC action is another step forward for ATandamp;T andparticularly for customers who unanimously support allowing ATandamp;T tobe able to compete to meet their needs. ... We believe we will beable to conform to the FCC's guidelines.''</TEXT></DOC>
