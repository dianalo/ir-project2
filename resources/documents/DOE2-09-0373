However, once President Reagon tookoffice, the debate began again. Various commissions studied the problemand eventually it was again supported. The author says the biggest publicdebate is not over what the weapons cost but why the U.S. processes nuclearweapons and how well and how safely they carry out the critical missionsassigned to them.
