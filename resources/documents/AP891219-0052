They applauded therecommendation.   Thousands of students gathered early today around the statue ofSt. Wenceslas with banners, balloons and red, white and blueCzechoslovak flags for pro-Havel demonstrations. Some students, whoarrived early on trains and buses from throughout the country,passed the time before the demonstrations by Christmas shoppingalong Wenceslas Square.   Calfa's recommendation and its reception by the deputiesappeared to signal the final victory of the peaceful revolution,which in one month has swept away 41 years of Communist dominationof Czechoslovakia's government.   The pro-democracy opposition has negotiated a new non-Communistgovernment that includes two former dissidents; ousted hard-lineCommunist President Gustav Husak; and introduced reforms in everypolitical, social and religious sphere.   Support has been snowballing for Havel, who would be the firstnon-Communist to hold the office in 41 years. Husak resigned Dec.10.   Havel's only rivals are former Communist Premier Ladislav Adamecand Alexander Dubcek, who led the reforms of the ``Prague Spring''in 1968 and was removed by the Kremlin. Dubcek, who enjoystremendous support in his native Slovakia, has been waffling onwhether he is in the race.   Cestmir Cisar, the students' candidate for president in 1968 andan unofficial contender in the current race, withdrew Monday nightand threw his support behind Havel.   Czechoslovakia's constitution requires Parliament to elect a newpresident within two weeks of a vacancy occurring, but Communistand opposition leaders agreed to introduce a resolution to extendthe deadline.   The two-point agenda approved at the start of today's meetingwould give them until late January to choose a president. It wasunclear when a vote on the extension would be taken.   Calfa said a president should be chosen before the year ends in12 days.   ``The government is making efforts to solve the political andconstitutional crisis,'' Calfa said. ``We want to ask the FederalAssembly to contribute to this effort by electing the president bythe end of this year.''   Josef Bartoncik, head of the lower house of the bicameralParliament and leader of the People's Party, said his party wouldsupport Havel and would recommend that Parliament recovene Dec. 28or Dec. 29 to elect the president.   The Socialist Party, one of four small parties in theCommunist-dominated Parliament, also endorsed Havel.   Deputies also were considering the government's reform program,which outlines political and economic changes, repudiates therepression that followed the 1968 anti-reform crackdown, andsupports a democratic socialism.   Meanwhile, opposition leaders said reports of a planned militarycoup were spread to cause uncertainty. Opposition member SashaVondra was quoted as saying in the Svobodne Slovo daily that therumor of an impending coup ``is purposefully propagateddisinformation and rumor.''   Representatives from the Civic Forum met Monday with DefenseMinister Miroslav Vacek who assured them the army supporteddemocratic reform, he said.   Col. Stanislav Pohoral, a Defense Ministry spokesman, condemnedthe circulation of ``leaflets, mainly in Brno, which say a ...military coup is being planned,'' calling it ``totallyirresponsible.''   The army leadership ``distances itself from these actions andrejects the accusations,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
