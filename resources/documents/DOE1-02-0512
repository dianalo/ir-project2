In comparingthe mean element concentrations for 28 western coals the Adaville No.1 contains (1) significantly higher concentrations of Br, Ca, Ga, Rb,Sr, and Zr, (2) significant lower concentrations of Al, Ce, Cr, La, andNa, and (3) similar concentrations of Sc, Ti, and V. Scanning electronmicroanalysis (SEM) of low temperature ash (LTA) revealed the presenceof abundant clays and plagioclase feldspar; minor hematite, pyrite, quartz,gypsum, sylvite, amphibole, pyroxene, and rutile; and trace amounts ofdelafossite (the first recorded occurrence in a coal seam), calcite,cuprite, cassiterite, K-feldspar, and sphene. The cross-seam distributionof these minerals, combined with the similarity of the concentrationprofiles of Al, Ce, Cr, La, V, Rb, Sr, and Sc to that of LTA, suggestthat all of the elements, except Br, Ga, and possible Zr, have significantmineralogical associations with the Adaville No. 1 coal. The presenceof authigenic quartz, sylvite, delafossite, gypsum, and pyrite, and crystalsolution features, suggest considerable ion mobility during peat depositionand coalification. The mineralogy and trace-element chemistry of theAdaville No. 1 coal seam are consistent with a wave-dominated deltaicdepositional environment, long-lived saline conditions during peat accumulation,and a siliceous igneous rock source terrane.</TEXT></DOC>
