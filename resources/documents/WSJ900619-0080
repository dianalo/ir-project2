Warm.Apocalyptic.   Over at the home of Neville Mallinson, who owns 37 Biblesand a Shell service station, talk of Armageddon fills theliving room air. The host offers a pot of tea and commencesto recite the cataclysmic prophecies in the Book ofRevelation, from memory, as if they were the multiplicationtables. Black majority rule, he concludes, is the evil comingto devour white South Africa. &quot;If they {the blacks} kill eachother over a papaw or banana,&quot; he says, &quot;then what will beleft of us?&quot;</LP><TEXT>   A few blocks away, Stefanie van den Heever pours pineapplewine while her husband, Chris, plots the preservation ofwhite civilization in Africa. A bust of Cicero looks on fromthe parlor. &quot;We have fought and paid in blood for ourfatherland,&quot; Mr. van den Heever says. &quot;We won't give up theland of our birth. Never.&quot;   At the Amarula Restaurant, the only diner in town, mayorand cotton farmer Willie Scheepers attacks his double rumpsteak and relates the lesson of Piet Retief, a distantrelative on his mother's side. Mr. Retief and his band ofAfrikaner pioneers were massacred by the Zulus during peacetalks with Dingane, the Zulu king, in 1838. As a gesture ofgood faith, the Afrikaners had left their weapons behind.   &quot;That won't happen again,&quot; assures the mayor. He plops hiswife's purse on the table and pulls out a pistol. &quot;She knowshow to use my R-1, too,&quot; he says. The R-1 is a standard SouthAfrican army rifle.   Fear and loathing stalk South Africa's conservativeheartland these days. The whirlwind of change that has sweptthe country in the past few months has inflamed the passionsof the white right. Pride. Prejudice. Defiance. Desperation.First came the unbanning of the African National Congress,then the release of ANC leader Nelson Mandela, then thebeginning of power-sharing talks with the blacks. Now, Mr.Mandela is triumphantly circling the world, arriving in NewYork tomorrow to a ticker-tape parade. As the walls close inon white-minority rule and the cozy privileges of apartheid,right-wing emotions, so raw and intense, threaten the &quot;new&quot;South Africa with a level of racial violence unknown even inthe old one.   From the wheat fields of the western Transvaal comes thecrackle of guns at a practice session of the Boere Commando,a group of white vigilantes who would rather go down shootingthan submit to the black majority. From the mining towns ofthe Orange Free State come the thundering threats of a &quot;holywar&quot; by the Afrikaner Resistance Movement. From theVortrekker Monument in Pretoria, the sacred shrine ofAfrikanerdom, comes the pounding of 100,000 feet stompingdefiantly at a mass rally called by the pro-apartheidConservative Party. A banner held aloft at the gatheringproclaims, &quot;White nationhood is greater than death.&quot; From allacross the &quot;platteland&quot; comes the rebellious message: Stopthe reforms, or else.   President F.W. de Klerk, who began the reforms when hetook over the leadership of the ruling National Party lastyear, dismisses threats of resistance and revolt as&quot;irresponsible, undemocratic and dangerous&quot; and vows not tobe deterred. Yet alarm is spreading through government at thevirulence of the white backlash to Mr. de Klerk's dismantlingof apartheid, the system of racial segregation that his partycreated and that he once resolutely defended. Even the ANC,which has been waging a guerrilla war against white rule for30 years, recoils at the depth of right-wing emotions. Sinceits unbanning, the ANC has been trying to reach out towhites, including some of the more conservativeorganizations, telling them that they have nothing to fearfrom majority rule. Mr. Mandela encourages whites to supportMr. de Klerk's reforms.   But, says Thabo Mbeki, the ANC's director of foreignaffairs, &quot;Some whites believe they have a divine mission todestroy the ANC. . . . The closer we get to change in SouthAfrica, one presumes, the more desperate they will become.&quot;   Yet Mr. de Klerk, himself an Afrikaner, is reluctant toorder a crackdown, fearing that such a move, such asdisarming radical right-wingers, could spark a tribal waramong the whites, setting Afrikaner against Afrikaner. Forthe right wing is no mere lunatic fringe, but a significantslice of the white population -- farmers, miners, factoryforemen, civil servants, policemen, soldiers. For 42 years,apartheid has been their security blanket. Today, they defyanyone to take it away.   &quot;They are our burden, for we have made them what theyare,&quot; says Beyers Naude, who has been trying to convert hisfellow whites for the past four decades, first as a maverickminister in the Dutch Reformed Church and now as a member ofthe ANC's negotiating team. &quot;The ideology of apartheid hasbeen ingrained so deeply, in their outlook, actions andentire beings. We just can't drop them now. The entire whitecommunity has a responsibility to convince them of theirfoolishness.&quot;   The elderly preacher sighs. &quot;It is a tedious process,&quot; hesays. &quot;But the only alternative is bloodshed.&quot;   It is harvest time in Marble Hall, the cotton capital ofSouth Africa. So much fluff has fallen from the wagons on theway to the gins that the roads seem to be paved in cotton.Everything is white.   Marble Hall, located on the plains northeast of Pretoria,is a bastion of the Conservative Party, the defender ofapartheid and white self-determination. About 3,500 whiteslive in Marble Hall, almost all of them Afrikaners. Many aredescended from the Afrikaner pioneers who battled the Zulusand British for a place they could call their own.English-speakers are considered &quot;uitlanders,&quot; foreigners.Blacks come into town during the day to work or shop, and bynightfall they are on their way back to the homelands ofLebowa and kwaNdebele. This is the ordained neatness ofapartheid.   There are two cotton gins in town, and a marble mine a fewmiles out. (The marble was discovered before the farmerslearned to grow cotton, hence the name, Marble Hall.) Churchspires and grain silos rise above the trees. The houses aresolid brick, the streets are neatly paved, the lawns alwaysgreen. The only theater in town is a drive-in. Saturdays arefor rugby. Sundays are for church.   Marble Hall once was a National Party town -- as wasnearly every white town in the country -- when the NationalParty was still the defender of white supremacy. But thecoming change was evident when Willie Scheepers Sr., themayor's father, switched his allegiance.   &quot;I've been National Party from the day I first opened myeyes,&quot; he says. His wife and sons began leaving the party in1983 when it started tinkering with apartheid by allowingIndians and coloreds -- people of mixed race -- intoparliament, albeit in separate chambers. For a while, Mr.Scheepers wouldn't talk politics to any of them. He did votefor his son when he ran for the city council on theConservative Party ticket. But he rooted for theNationalists.   Then, one night last year, he was watching the televisionnews when he heard a report about Mr. de Klerk's return froma trip to Europe. &quot;There he was at the airport,&quot; Mr.Scheepers recalls, &quot;and someone asks him about the GroupAreas Act {which segregates neighborhoods}. Well, de Klerksays it is no longer a factor in South Africa, that it isalmost gone.&quot; That did it. The Conservative Party had anothermember.   &quot;All my adult life, I've had a Group Areas Act,&quot; says Mr.Scheepers, who is 69 years old. &quot;It is the white peoples'guarantee.&quot;   He picks up the National Party's election manifesto of1988, which he keeps under a lace doily on the coffee table.Right there, on page two, it says the party's policy &quot;is thateach group {race} should have its own residential areas,schools, homes for senior citizens. . . .&quot; The Act is stillon the books, but the very notion that the government is nowthinking of scrapping it is treachery enough.   &quot;They've been lying to us,&quot; says Mr. Scheepers, a retiredfarmer. He wonders how anyone can trust the government nowwhen it promises to protect white minority rights in the newconstitution.   He feels betrayed, bewildered, angry. &quot;My nationalism isstill the same. My belief in God is still the same. My loveof country is still the same,&quot; he says. &quot;I haven't changed.They've changed.&quot;   Since 1948, when it first came to power, the NationalParty, along with the Dutch Reformed Church, has told whitesthat they have a divine right to rule the country. Theyinstitutionalized racism, made it legal, created an apartheidtheology. It's in the Bible, they said.   Now, although the government may have decided to negotiatea new constitution with Mr. Mandela and the church hasrepudiated apartheid, to many right-wingers he is still thesame antichrist the government and the church always said hewas. It's right there in the Book of Revelation, they say.   Around Marble Hall, Mr. de Klerk is commonly viewed as atraitor and Johan Heyns, the head of the Dutch ReformedChurch, a Communist. In the past two years, nearly 200 adultshave joined the new Afrikaans Protestant Church, which brokeaway from the local Dutch Reformed congregation when it beganpreaching about integrating the races. Last week constructionbegan on a new APC church, which will seat 450.   Over at the van den Heever house, Mr. van den Heeveroffers a refill of pineapple wine. &quot;By the way,&quot; he says,smiling broadly, &quot;the most popular video in South Africatoday is the release of Mandela. You just play it backwards.&quot;   The Conservative Party would like to run all the recentreforms in reverse. It is challenging the government to calla new general election, claiming that the National Partydoesn't have a mandate for its reforms. But the governmentwouldn't dare call an election now -- and it doesn't need tountil 1994 -- because the Conservatives, at this moment,might well win a majority. In the parliamentary election ninemonths ago, before the reforms kicked in, the Conservativeswon 31% of the white vote. Such is the current disaffectionwith the National Party.   Plan B for the Conservatives is to press their demand fora white homeland, a chunk of South Africa where whites willbe in the majority and they can rule themselves withoutinterference. The Conservatives may eventually bring thatdemand to the negotiations on a new constitution. &quot;But wewon't go into negotiations to discuss our exit from power,&quot;says Mr. van den Heever, one of the party's strategists. &quot;Noway.&quot;   Both the government and the ANC, however, say the idea ofa white homeland is nonsense and unworthy of negotiation.But, says Mr. van den Heever, &quot;We know what we want. In someways we may look stupid, but, God knows, we aren't.&quot;   One thing they believe with certainty is thatpower-sharing with the blacks won't work. &quot;You can't simplytake some power from the whites and give it to the blacks.They won't be satisfied until they have it all,&quot; Mr. van denHeever says. &quot;The biggest problem facing us is that the blackman doesn't have the discipline to rule himself. . . . Lookat Africa. They just don't get on with it.&quot;   The right-wingers frequently look to the black-ruledcountries north of the Limpopo River and cringe in horror andfear at the poverty, corruption and tribal warfare. Thelesson they draw is that black rule will similarly impoverishSouth Africa.   &quot;We don't want to be brought down to their standards,&quot;Mayor Scheepers says.   Adds Mr. Mallinson: &quot;It's easy to say we'll give SouthAfrica to Mandela. It's OK if he keeps it up to standards andmy wife and children don't get raped. We just don't want tobe ruled by a bunch of hooligans.&quot;   On the other side of town, beyond the cotton gins and thecitrus groves, Phil and Cornelia De Wet watch the walls closein from their tobacco farm. They came to South Africa, theland of their grandparents, in 1963, having left Kenya afterblack independence there. In years since, they have watchedthe southward migration of whites from Rhodesia (nowZimbabwe), Mozambique and Angola, as black governments cameto power in those countries. Now, there is no place left togo. For the whites of Africa, this is the last stop.   &quot;Life on the farms is getting impossible,&quot; says Mr. DeWet. The other week, his van was stolen from the garage; notlong before, a tractor was taken from the shed. Taxes aresoaring -- mainly, he reckons, to subsidize the blackdevelopment. And the blacks are talking ever more loudlyabout land redistribution.   &quot;They'll push us so far and then no more,&quot; he says.   &quot;It's do or die,&quot; says his wife.   The other day, their teen-age son came home from schoolwith a curious question: Dad, will you capitulate? Repliedthe father: &quot;No, I'll fight and die.&quot; The son smiled proudly.   &quot;When I came here from Kenya, I started from scratch,&quot;says Mr. De Wet. &quot;When the ANC takes over, they'llnationalize my land, and I'll have nothing again. Well, theycan have it. But, by golly, I'll take a few of them with me.&quot;   He wipes his face, weathered from years in the Africansun. &quot;Mark my words,&quot; he says.</TEXT></DOC>
