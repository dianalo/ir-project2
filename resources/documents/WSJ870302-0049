Ross Johnson, RJR's president, sparked great excitement recently when he said he was weighing the idea of putting the company's tobacco business into a master limited partnership, part of which would be sold to the public.    Investors seem to like the idea. Even before Mr. Johnson's announcement, shares of RJR, Philip Morris, American Brands, U.S. Tobacco and Loews climbed briefly on a report by an Oppenheimer analyst that a partial sale of RJR's tobacco operations might be in the cards.    But there are big legal, tax and other obstacles to creating tobacco partnerships, lawyers and industry executives say. They think the partnerships would be a bad idea for the same reasons they believe RJR wants to segregate its tobacco business: Cigarette makers have a bad name and are besieged by health-related lawsuits.    RJR says it is &quot;still studying&quot; the issue. Analysts say other companies are too, although Philip Morris says a tobacco partnership isn't &quot;high on the agenda.&quot; American Brands and Loews won't comment.    Tobacco companies so far haven't lost a lawsuit. But 145 cases are pending against them, compared with 50 a year ago, says Diana Temple, analyst at Salomon Brothers. She expects the number to keep growing.    If courts started ruling in plaintiffs' favor and awarding damages, holders of tobacco partnership units could &quot;wind up carrying the liability,&quot; up to the amount of their investment, says Robert Miller, a lawyer with Bishop Liberman andamp; Cook in New York. While they would be getting big dividends to compensate for the risk, as limited partners they could lose their entire investment if the partnership faced big claims.    Shareholders in a big, diversified company are better insulated from such claims, some money managers say. If things get bad, they say, dividends might be suspended and the stock might dive, but it wouldn't go to zero.    Because of sheer size, some tobacco operations would be hard to sell in the form of a partnership, analysts say.    RJR's U.S. tobacco business in 1986 had profit from operations of almost $1.5 billion, says Allan Kaplan, a Merrill Lynch analyst. If the partnership were priced to yield 12% to reflect the risks, its value would be 8.3 times pre-tax profit, or $12 billion. Selling even 10% of that, or more than $1 billion of units, would be a &quot;big obstacle,&quot; Mr. Kaplan says.    For RJR, there might be drawbacks to retaining 90% of the partnership. As general partner, the dividends it received would be taxable. And it might not see much improvement in its stock.    RJR trades at 12 times expected 1987 earnings while packaged-food stocks have price-earnings ratios of almost 20, and Mr. Johnson thinks RJR's P/E might be higher without the tobacco business. But divesting only 10% of it wouldn't be enough, some money managers say.    They think RJR and others should simply donate to current holders most of the shares in a new tobacco company. That's how Time Inc. sloughed off Temple-Inland, a forest products concern, says Robert Willens, an accountant at Peat Marwick Mitchell.    But spinning off a big piece of the tobacco business might mean &quot;killing the golden goose,&quot; says one tobacco executive. If the company divested 90%, it might forfeit a corresponding 90% of the cash flow, which might have been used to expand other businesses. The executive has &quot;looked at&quot; many ways to shed a tobacco unit, he says, but hasn't found a good one.    Mainly from tobacco, RJR generates about $600 million of excess cash flow annually, says Salomon's Ms. Temple. Philip Morris generates about $1.6 billion and Loews about $200 million, she says.    One motive for divesting a tobacco business, executives say, is to insulate the parent company from potential liabilities. But in the event of big claims, lawyers say, parent companies might still be liable.    &quot;Claimants go after the party with the deep pockets,&quot; says Bishop Liberman's Mr. Miller. After exhausting the tobacco company's resources, claimants might &quot;try and pierce the veil and get to the parent&quot; or general partner, he says.    Industry executives say they don't expect an avalanche of successful tobacco suits similar to the asbestos-related suits that overwhelmed Manville, which is currently in bankruptcy-law proceedings. Unlike Manville, tobacco companies have the financial resources to meet even big liabilities, analysts say.    If RJR does create a tobacco partnership, it could be the last, says Peat Marwick's Mr. Willens. Congressmen are already concerned about the proliferation of smaller limited partnerships such as Mesa and Boston Celtics that don't pay corporate taxes. A big tobacco partnership &quot;could galvanize them&quot; into banning future tax-free partnerships, Mr. Willens says.    Industry people don't have high hopes of unloading a tobacco business on another company. &quot;No one will buy it with the liability,&quot; says an executive. &quot;The only thing you can be reasonably sure of,&quot; he says, &quot;is that you can't get rid of the liability.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
