The package on the table as the talks continued last nightalso would tax more of Social Security benefits paid tomiddle- and upper-income elderly.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;We're awfully close to having an agreement in principle .. . which would require a White House foray&quot; today to briefthe president, a Republican staffer close to the talks said.   But Democratic aides cautioned that the negotiators --five top congressional leaders and three Bush administrationofficials -- hadn't yet shaken hands on an agreement. &quot;We'rea long way from Tipperary,&quot; said one.   Moreover, Budget Director Richard Darman cautioned againsttoo much optimism.   One issue that remained unresolved was the shape of thecapital-gains tax cut. Although one option was anadministration plan to tax only those gains in excess ofinflation, an approach known as indexing, some Democrats hadreservations. Last night, Democrats were still talking aboutreducing the top rate on capital gains from the current 33%.This would be offset not only with new limits on deductions,but also by an increase in the marginal income tax rate, now28%, paid by the highest-income Americans. Democrats aren'tany longer pushing to raise the rate as high as 33%, however,sources said.   Although the specifics remained in flux, House BudgetCommittee Chairman Leon Panetta (D., Calif.) briefedDemocratic members of his panel on the outlines of a possiblepackage to reduce the deficit by $500 billion over fiveyears.   He said, and others confirmed, that the package underdiscussion also included an increase to 17 cents from ninecents a gallon in the gasoline tax, effective before the endof 1990, to raise nearly $40 billion over five years; anincrease in taxes on alcoholic beverages to raise between $12billion and $14 billion over five years; an increase of lessthan 10 cents in the cigarette tax, currently 16 cents apack; and a new 10% levy on certain luxury goods. Of the $500billion in deficit reduction over five years, about $130billion net would come from taxes.   Among the elements the California Democrat listed, andconfirmed by others, were a plan to raise $20 billion overfive years by subjecting to income taxes 85% of the SocialSecurity benefits paid to upper-income Americans. Currently,50% of the benefits paid to couples with annual incomes above$32,000 and individuals with incomes above $25,000 are taxed.   Republicans had been resisting that approach for weeks,saying it shouldn't be counted as reducing spending on SocialSecurity, but instead as a tax increase.   The package is likely to be politically explosive, andrank-and-file members of both parties have been warning theirleaders that their votes aren't assured. For all theattention paid to capital gains, congressmen representingworking-class, urban districts said the issue was far lessrelevant to their constituents than cuts in health care ornew excise taxes. &quot;If I go back to Atlanta and say we heldthe line on capital gains but we did you in on Medicare,they'll say you're not bringing us good news,&quot; said Rep. JohnLewis (D., Ga.).   Conversely, representatives of more affluent districts andconservatives were troubled by the reports that negotiatorswere considering tax, Medicare and Social Security changesthat aimed at middle and upper-income constituents. &quot;They maybe agreeing on something the rest of us ain't going to buy,&quot;said Sen. Trent Lott (R., Miss.). &quot;They'd better check withus troops.&quot;   In all, about $60 billion of the $500 billion in deficitreduction over five years would come from cutting projectedMedicare spending -- including an increase in the premium theelderly pay to cover doctor bills, the congressional sourcessaid. They said the premium, currently $28.60 a month, wouldbe raised to cover 30% of the costs of this part of theprogram, up from the 25% the law currently provides. Thedeductible would also be raised to $150 from $75.   An accord in the next day or two, even if details remainunsettled, probably would give Congress and President Bushenough of an excuse to delay the spending cuts directed bythe Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law, cuts that arescheduled to bite into federal spending Monday.   Republicans have been pushing limits on tax deductions forupper-income Americans for months as a way to offset a cut incapital-gains taxes, which largely would benefit those samewell-off taxpayers. Initially, the GOP proposed to limit onlydeductions for state and local income taxes, but later theybroadened their plan to cover all deductions.   One variant under discussion by negotiators, whichresembles proposals crafted by Rep. Don Pease (D., Ohio),would limit overall deductions for taxpayers with incomesabove $100,000. A taxpayer with income of $150,000, forinstance, would face a floor of $5,000 (10% of the differencebetween $150,000 and $100,000). If the taxpayer's deductionstotaled $45,000, he would be allowed to deduct only $40,000(or $45,000 minus $5,000). But details weren't firm lastnight.   One reason the Democrats are so intent on completing thetask that began in May is that they fear they'll be blamed ifthe government isn't able to keep operating after the fiscalyear begins Monday. House Democrats were inclined to pass aDemocratic alternative budget to put the onus on Mr. Bush forthe failure of the budget talks. But that plan was scrappedafter Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell (D., Maine) toldHouse Speaker Thomas Foley (D., Wash.) that he didn't havethe votes in the Senate to pass such a bill.   Negotiations shifted to the dinner table at one point lastnight, as the three administration bargainers -- TreasurySecretary Nicholas Brady, White House Chief of Staff JohnSununu and Mr. Darman -- invited themselves to join Sen.Mitchell in the senators' private dining room.   But even as his top advisers were working to narrow theirdifferences with Congress in Washington, Mr. Bush wascriticizing congressional Democrats in campaign speeches inthe Midwest. &quot;Congress has got to stop being manic depressive-- manic on spending, depressive for the economy,&quot; he said.   In discussions of how to structure a cut in capital-gainstaxes -- one of President Bush's campaign promises and asticking point in the talks from the start -- negotiatorsalso have talked about targeting an additional tax break oninvestments in start-up companies.   The negotiators also tentatively agreed to permanentlyextend tax credits for research and development spending andfor people who build low-income housing. The plan also wouldtemporarily extend some other soon-to-expire tax breaks.   To help low-income individuals, the plan would increasethe refundable earned-income tax credit for the working poor,and Democrats were pressing for an increase in the standarddeduction taken by taxpayers who don't itemize.   One issue that remained unsettled was whether to includean expansion of the child-care tax credit in thedeficit-reduction package. Although such a provision could becostly, it also would help satisfy Democrats' demand that theoverall package not hit lower- and middle-income Americansharder than those in upper-income brackets.   Although plans to alter the congressional budget processget little attention outside Washington, they remain animportant part of the negotiations. Democrats appear ready toagree to Republican demands that any package include newfixed deficit targets for the next five years, rather thansimply deficit-reduction goals. Total appropriations would becapped for each of the five years, but Democrats haveresisted Republican demands to specify the ceilings ondefense and non-defense spending for each year as well.   One sticky issue, however, is whether the Appropriationscommittees would be permitted to use some additionalgasoline-tax revenues for highway spending in excess of theceilings.   The talks began in mid-May at the call of President Bushwhose advisers urged him to seek a deficit compromise to helpbring down interest rates and reduce the risk of recession.But the talks, which initially involved 21 members ofCongress, made little headway until the president disavowedhis no-new-taxes campaign pledge on June 26.   Even after that, the talks sputtered along through thesummer. After Labor Day, the bargainers secluded themselvesat nearby Andrews Air Force Base, taking over the officers'bar and VIP bungalows. What started as a weekend stay becamean 11-day ordeal, and the hoped-for candor and compromise waslost amid recrimination over news leaks.   Finally, 10 days ago, the five highest-rankingcongressional leaders and the three administration officialsexcluded others from the bargaining table, and returned tothe Capitol for the latest intensive round. In the end, thefundamental differences that vexed negotiators from the startwere among the final issues to be resolved: the balancebetween taxes, cuts in domestic spending and cuts in defensespending.   As reported previously, negotiators have agreed roughly toreduce spending on benefit programs by about $120 billion anddefense spending by about $170 billion, in addition toraising revenues by about $130 billion over five years,. Theremaining $70 billion in deficit reduction would come fromlower-than-forecast interest payments.   ---   David Wessel and David Rogers contributed to this article.</TEXT></DOC>
