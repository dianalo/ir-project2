Olsonleaves Robert E. Allen at the controls of a phone giant that isstill adjusting to losing its status as the world's largest companyfour years ago.   Olson, 62, cut costs and gave direction to American Telephone andamp;Telegraph Co. Now Allen, 53, will be under pressure to keep themomentum going.   ``Olson had drive, energy and he was a bulldog that you didn'twant to cross,'' said Fulton Holmes, an analyst for ThomsonMcKinnon Securities. ``Allen is more sophisticated. Maybe he's gotthat inner toughness, but I'm going to hold off six months or ayear until I see it.''   Allen began serving as acting chairman during Olson's brief boutwith cancer and is expected to be given the nod for the top job bythe board of directors, possibly as soon as this week when theboard meets in conjunction with the annual meeting Wednesday inDenver.   ATandamp;T was staggering in September 1986 when Olson took over aschairman on the retirement of Charles L. Brown. The company hadlost its profitable local phone service monopolies in the 1984breakup of the Bell System and was losing hundreds of millions ofdollars annually on its computer business, which was supposed tolead the company into a high-technology future.   The company also had cut tens of thousands of jobs and moralewas low.   Olson gathered 27 top executives at a Cape Cod golf resort overthat Labor Day weekend in 1986. They thrashed over the future.Then, one by one, he asked the executives to stand and asked them,``Are you with me?''   Invariably, the reply was yes, Business Week recounted in itsJan. 18 issue.   The company is spending heavily on its long-distance network tosolidify its nearly 80 percent share of the interstatelong-distance market. It has cut its losses on computers under theleadership of Vittorio Cassoni, whom ATandamp;T hired from Italy'sOlivetti. And the company slashed an additional 27,000 jobs in asweeping cutback announced shortly before Christmas 1986.   In 1987, ATandamp;T's profit rose to $2 billion from a scant $139million the previous year, when earnings were depressed by a hugewriteoff that covered the cost of plant closings, job cuts andother factors.   Olson had the difficult job of trying to maintain employeeloyalty at the same time he was overseeing massive layoffs. Hetraveled around the country giving speeches to groups of employeesand meeting them personally.   Under Olson, ATandamp;T has appointed a new tier of managers whounderstand the difference between ATandamp;T's old monopoly standing andthe new competitive realities, analysts say.   The company has also eased off from its ``not-invented-here''syndrome, showing a willingness to team up with outside companiessuch as Ing. C. Olivetti SpA, Sun Microsystems Inc. and TandemComputers Inc.   ``I don't know if you want to say Olson made order out of chaos,but under his direction the company has got a much stronger visionof who they are and where they want to go,'' said Peter Bernstein,senior analyst at Probe Research Inc. in Cedar Knolls, N.J.   Some of the problems ATandamp;T will have to face with Olson gone:   _Morale, though somewhat improved, still leaves room forimprovement, ATandamp;T's own surveys have found.   _The computer business continues to lose money and may notbecome profitable until 1990. Some analysts say the company needsto buy an established computer maker.   _Shareholders are agitating for an increase in the quarterlydividend, which has been stuck at $1.20 a share since the breakup.   _ATandamp;T still gets 91 percent of its revenue in the United Statesand is having a hard time cracking foreign markets, a goal of thecompany since the early 1980s.   Allen, the man most likely to face the challenges, is a careeremployee who worked his way up through telephone operatingcompanies in Indiana, Pennsylvania, Illinois and the mid-Atlanticregion. In contrast to Olson, his specialty is in finance.   Allen was named president and chief operating officer in 1986.Before that he was chairman and chief executive of the InformationSystems division. Prior to that he was ATandamp;T's executive in chargeof corporate administration and finance.   In a sign of Allen's standing, he shared the spotlight withOlson in the introduction to the company's latest annual report,which featured a question-and-answer session with the twoexecutives.   Analysts differed on how significant Olson's loss will be.   ``ATandamp;T lost a key leader. (Allen has) got to measure up greaterthan Olson, and that's going to be a tough road to travel,'' Holmessaid.   But Jack Grubman, an analyst at PaineWebber Inc., said: ``He(Olson) will be missed, but from a practical, business point ofview, ATandamp;T will not miss a beat.   ``Bob Allen is less direct than Jim (Olson), but he is verytough-minded,'' Grubman said.</TEXT></DOC>
