The bank, Lewiston Bank, Lewiston, Ill., and one of the thrifts, First Federal Savings andamp; Loan Association, Beloit, Kan., are to operate today as units of other institutions. The Federal Home Loan Bank Board took control of the other thrift, Key Savings andamp; Loan Association, Englewood, Colo.    State regulators closed Key, a state-chartered stock association. The Bank Board transferred most of its assets, which totaled $241.6 million, deposits and other liabilities to a newly chartered federal mutual association of the same name that opened Saturday.    Key's problems began after Laurence Vineyard and a group of private investors bought all of the thrift's stock in September 1983 and began a program of rapid expansion, the Bank Board said.    Mr. Vineyard is awaiting sentencing on a Jan. 30 federal court conviction for conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud and for falsifying documents in order to receive loans from Key, the Bank Board said. Mr. Vineyard served as chairman of the thrift and resigned July 1 after he was indicted by a federal grand jury, according to the Bank Board.    Under a management contract, the new Key will be operated for the Bank Board by Otero Savings andamp; Loan Association, Colorado Springs, Colo.    The Bank Board declared First Federal insolvent and transferred the federally chartered stock institution's deposits to Home Savings Association, Kansas City, Mo. First Federal had assets of $82.9 million.    Lewiston, closed Friday by state banking authorities, was scheduled to reopen today as a branch of National Bank of Canton, Canton, Ill., the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. said.    Lewiston had assets of $14.4 million and held deposits of $14 million in 2,500 accounts. It was the second bank to fail this year in Illinois, and the 33rd in the nation. </TEXT></DOC>
