But oil reserve estimates declined.    As of Dec. 31, natural gas reserve estimates rose to 99.2 billion cubic feet from 94.4 billion cubic feet the previous year. Estimates of oil reserves, meanwhile, slipped 5.3% to 3.6 million barrels from 3.8 million barrels at Dec. 31, 1986.    The oil and gas exploration and production concern said its estimated net future revenue, inclusive of a 10% discount factor in line with Securities and Exchange Commission stipulations, fell 7.2% to $113.4 million from $122.2 million in the year-to-year period.    The company said the drop in present value is the result of the replacement of natural gas sold under higher priced contracts with natural gas that was being sold at lower, market responsive prices at the end of 1987. The decrease is also related to the drop in crude oil prices, Ensource said. </TEXT></DOC>
