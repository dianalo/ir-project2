The decision, handed down by the 11th Circuit Court ofAppeals highlights a rule that allows judges to crack down onfrivolous legal claims by making lawyers whose pleadings lackany legal or factual basis pay the fees and costs of theiropposing counsel. The sanction was imposed on the left-wingChristic Institute, in Washington, D.C., its general counsel,Daniel P. Sheehan, and two journalists.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Sheehan filed a civil racketeering suit on behalf ofthe institute and the journalists, Tony Avirgan and MarthaHoney, in May 1986, alleging a broad conspiracy by the U.S.military, the Central Intelligence Agency, arms merchants andColombian drug lords to overthrow the government ofNicaragua. Filed in the wake of the Iran-Contraarms-for-hostages scandal, the suit also sought to prove theexistence of U.S. covert operations in Cuba, Southeast Asia,Iran and Libya.   Chief U.S. District Judge James King of Miami dismissedthe suit a month after it was filed and later levied the $1.1million sanction under Rule 11 of the federal rules of civilprocedure.   Since the rule was toughened in 1983, motions forsanctions have become almost routine in civil litigation,inciting resentment among lawyers and judges. In a recentpoll by Litigation News, a newsletter published by theAmerican Bar Association's section on litigation, 61% ofdefense and plaintiff lawyers favored repeal of the rule bythe U.S. Judicial Conference, the administrative arm of thefederal courts.   Civil rights groups also have complained that Rule 11 isbeing used disproportionately against them, penalizinglawyers for filing civil rights claims and deterring othersfrom taking on such cases. In April, the U.S. Supreme Courtlet stand sanctions against two prominent civil libertiesactivists -- William Kunstler of New York and JuliusChambers, now director of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund of NewYork -- for bringing suits deemed to be frivolous.   In the Christic Institute case, the appeals court agreedwith Judge King that sanctions were appropriate because theplaintiffs never produced &quot;competent evidence&quot; to supporttheir claims. &quot;Status as a public interest law firm or thenature of the claim does not confer immunity from attorney'sfees for bringing and maintaining frivolous lawsuits,&quot; thethree-member panel ruled.   Mr. Sheehan, the institute's general counsel, said that heproduced credible evidence to support his claim but that itwas ruled inadmissible by Judge King. He said he wouldpetition for a rehearing of the case by the full appealscourt. If the ruling is upheld, he said, it will have achilling effect on any lawyer who contemplates bringing asuit alleging federal criminal conduct.   Defense attorney Jack McKay of the Washington firm ofShaw, Pittman, Potts andamp; Trowbridge, who represented a formerCIA official in the case, said the ruling won't deter alluntested claims, only those with &quot;no foundation in fact.&quot;   ---   SMOKER'S SUIT REINSTATED by Louisiana high court.   The Louisiana Supreme Court in New Orleans overturned adecision by an appeals court that had barred a smoker fromseeking damages for alleged smoking-related illnesses understate law.   The court's ruling means that Robert C. Gilboy, who wasdiagnosed in 1986 as having cancer of the brain and lung,will be able to go to trial against several cigarettemanufacturers.   The high court rejected the argument that themanufacturers weren't liable for any of Mr. Gilboy's allegedinjuries because he chose to smoke despite being aware of thepossible health risks.   Instead, the court ruled that a jury should decide whetherMr. Gilboy understood the risks when he began smoking as achild and whether his alleged addiction made it impossiblefor him to quit.   Richard Daynard, an anti-smoking advocate who runs theTobacco Products Liability Project in Boston, said the rulingwould make it easier for smokers to bring similar cases totrial.   But Mr. Daynard and George R. Covert, Mr. Gilboy's BatonRouge lawyer, said the courts might not be so sympathetic toplaintiffs who began smoking after 1966, when Congress beganrequiring that warning labels be included on cigarettepackages.   A spokeswoman for defendant R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. ofNew York said the company would have an opportunity topresent its defenses at trial. She said the company hadn'tyet decided whether to seek further appellate review.   ---   FORMER WEDTECH DIRECTOR sues insurance company over legalfees.   Franklyn Chinn, whose racketeering and fraud convictionsin the Wedtech Corp. influence-peddling scandal wereoverturned three weeks ago, sued the company's insurer forrefusing to pay for his defense in several Wedtech cases.   The insurer, Federal Insurance Co., rescinded Wedtech'sexecutive liability policy in 1987, after the defensecontractor reported that some of its directors and officerswere being investigated for allegedly bribing publicofficials and defrauding stockholders. Mr. Chinn and formerWedtech consultant E. Robert Wallach, an adviser to formerAttorney General Edwin Meese, remain defendants inWedtech-related civil fraud cases in New York.   In his suit, filed in San Francisco Superior Court, Mr.Chinn contends that the policy provided for $15 million ofcoverage &quot;for losses arising from wrongful acts committed bythe insured under the insured's capacity as a director.&quot; Mr.Chinn's Wedtech-related legal costs exceed $2 million, thesuit claims.   But in court papers, Federal Insurance says it wasentitled to cancel the contract because Wedtech failed todisclose that it had falsified records and invoices toDefense Department agencies.   A spokeswoman for Chubb Corp., the Warren, N.J., parent ofFederal Insurance, declined to comment on the suit.   ---   NOTED: Robert B.
