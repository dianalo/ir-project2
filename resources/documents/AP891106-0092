(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Space shuttle Discovery will belaunched in two weeks on a military mission if NASA officials turnup no problems during a two-day flight review that began Monday.   The space agency has been aiming for a Nov. 20 liftoff, butshuttle managers admit the schedule is tight to complete allnecessary work. They will set a date Tuesday after assessing thereadiness of all flight hardware, ground support and worldwidetracking operations.   Because the military payload in Discovery's cargo bay isclassified, the Defense Department and NASA have revealed verylittle about the mission. Officials plan to announce a four-hourlaunch period on the selected day and will make the countdownpublic with just nine minutes remaining.   Sources close to the project report the announced launch periodwill be between 6:30 p.m. and 10:30 p.m., making this only thethird after-dark shuttle launch in 32 missions.   The sources also report the payload is a $300 million 2{-tonsatellite called SigInt, for signal intelligence, which is tomonitor Soviet missile tests and eavesdrop on selected military anddiplomatic communications. A similar satellite was launched byanother Discovery astronaut crew in 1985.   The flight is expected to last four days.   The crew for the upcoming flight are Air Force Col. Frederick C.Gregory, the commander; Air Force Col. John Blaha, the pilot; andthree mission specialists, Navy Capt. Manley L. Carter Jr., F.Story Musgrave and Kathryn C. Thornton.</TEXT></DOC>
