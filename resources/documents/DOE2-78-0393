<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-78-0393 </DOCNO><TEXT>Unattended diode array spectrometers have been designed for ground basedstratospheric trace species monitoring by zenith sky visible spectrometry.Measurements are performed with a 1.0 nm resolution between 290 nm and590 nm in order to allow simultaneous evaluations of column densitiesof ozone, nitrogen dioxide. Field tests have shown that the species canbe monitored with a precision of + or - 2 Dobson for the first and +or - 2.10 to the 15th mol/sq cm for the second, although the absoluteaccuracy of the method is limited by the error of the estimation of theatmospheric optical path of the scattered light. Two identical instrumentswere set up in January 1988, one in Antarctica at Dumont d'Urville (66S, 140 E) to be operated all year and another one in the Arctic at ESRANGEat Kiruna (68 N; 22 E) which will operate to the final warming of spring1988. The data are processed in real time at both stations. O3 and NO2columns are transmitted together with surface and stratospheric temperatureand winds. They are also recorded for further treatment and search forOClO and BrO. Only one month of data from Antarctica is available atthe moment. Obtained during polar summer, they cannot show more thanstable columns of O3 and NO2 and for the last species, the buildup ofits diurnal variation.</TEXT></DOC>
