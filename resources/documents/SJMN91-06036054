Trailing thecoffin were Conner's wife, Sylvia, on the arm of Conner's longtime friendMarine Staff Sgt. Rick Castillo; and Conner's two sons, Michael Jr., 11, andMitchell, 7.;    Conner, 32, was killed Jan. 26 in Saudi Arabia, when hisarmored artillery truck collided with another as they tried to quickly pullback after shelling Iraqi positions. Two other soldiers were killed in thecrash.;    Four people delivered eulogies during the funeral Mass, whichlasted over an hour. Those in the congregation -- some in suits, others insweat shirts, elderly veterans side-by-side with toddlers -- learned thatConner liked to write poetry, draw, travel and play the accordion.;    &quot;Helived life to the fullest,&quot; said the Rev. John Wadovich, who celebrated theMass.;    Fremont Mayor Bill Ball said the city &quot;has lost a member of itsfamily.&quot; The theme in his eulogy of a civic family echoed several times duringthe funeral. Although Fremont is predominantly a bedroom community that overthe last few years has ballooned with the influx of new residents, &quot;there'sbeen quite a response from the community,&quot; said Conner's older brother, JerryPentin.;    Pentin, 34, said before the funeral that the &quot;phone has beenringing off the hook . . . total strangers&quot; who have offered sympathy andsupport. &quot;I think it really hit home -- someone from the community gettingkilled in the war,&quot; he said.;    When eulogizing his brother, Pentin quotedsome of the sentiments of community members. A woman whose Marine husband waskilled in Korea and whose Marine son was killed in Vietnam, wrote to thefamily: &quot;Like your Michael, they believed in their country and freedom forothers in this world.&quot;;    The most emotional eulogy came from Castillo, whohad been stationed with Conner at Camp Pendleton during infantry trainingschool.;    In a choked, halting voice, Castillo concluded, &quot;I say to Mike, mygood buddy . . . 'God bless. Semper fidelis.' &quot;;    Pentin said that Conner&quot;lived his life&quot; by those words, the Marine Corps motto of &quot;always faithful.&quot;;   Pentin -- a former Marine -- stressed before the service that his brother'sdeath had not altered his feelings about Desert Storm. &quot;I firmly believe inwhy he was there, and continue to support our president and our troops,&quot; hesaid.;    But during the service, he cited a letter from Conner about those inthe Bay Area protesting the war. &quot;I'm sure they have their good points, too,&quot;the letter said.;    Afterward, when the throng walked out under the gatheringclouds and curious stares of drivers on Fremont Boulevard, several mournersmentioned the shock of having the war hit home.;    &quot;When I was looking at theflag over the coffin,&quot; said the musician, Manibusan, &quot;I realized I didn't haveany answers about my feelings about the war. Just questions.&quot;;    A militaryburial for Conner is scheduled at 1 p.m. today at Hartley Cemetery in Lakeport.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  LARRY SLONAKER, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Alameda County/AM  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910205  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Tuesday  </DAY><MONTH>  February  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  640  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Tuesday February 5, 199100036054,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
