Marathon runners carried a large chain to symbolize Kauffmann'scaptivity during a 1,000-kilometer trek from Brittany in northwestFrance to a barge on the Seine, where politicians and loved onescalled for Kauffmann's release.   ``It is important that the captors know that all of France isunited,'' his wife, Joelle.   ``I came here to express my solidarity,'' said Human RightsMinister Claude Malhuret.   The Newspaper Guild of America, the Prague-based InternationalOrganization of Journalists and the Journalists' Committee for theLiberation of French Hostages in Lebanon all issued statementsappealing for the freeing of Kauffmann and other captives.   The education ministry asked that the statement by the Frenchgroup be read in classrooms.   But the name of another hostage, Middle East researcher MichelSeurat, abducted with Kauffmann on May 22, 1985, was barelyuttered.The Shitte Moslem group Islamic Jihad, which claimed theabductions, announced March 5, 1986, that Seurat had been executed.   Seurat's wife, Mary, asked that his name no longer be mentionedin nightly newscasts that count off the hostages' days of captivity.   ``We would like even more to be close to them, to tell them tohold on, that nothing will be neglected and nothing is,'' PresidentFrancois Mitterrand said on television.   ``But it is so hard, so difficult in the face of this pitilessact to arrange that Jean-Paul Kauffmann and our other Frenchmenheld hostage be freed one day.''   Kauffmann, 43, a reporter for the newsweekly Evenement du Jeudi,and Seurat were taken hostage as they drove from the Beirut airportfollowing Kauffmann's arrival.   Two other French hostages, diplomats Marcel Carton, 64, andMarcel Fontaine, 45, kidnapped March 22, 1985, have passed their1,000th days as captives.   Terry Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for TheAssociated Press, is the longest held of the 22 foreign hostages inLebanon. He was captured March 16, 1985.   Six French hostages, most of them held by the Organization ofRevolutionary Justice, have been freed since conservative PremierJacques Chirac came to power in March 1986.   In each case, France thanked Iran, which has influence over thegroups holding Westerners captive.   Iranian Vice Minister Ali Reza Moayeri, in a French televisioninterview Tuesday, said that Iran was not to be counted on for thefreeing of more hostages.   Iran ``benefits from a very important influence (in Lebanon)that can be used to free Western hostages, including French, but ata time when we have satisfying relations with France,'' Moayerisaid.   ``For the moment, diplomatic relations being broken between ourtwo countries, no move in favor of the hostages can be undertaken.''   France severed relations with Iran on July 17 after a disputeover an embassy employee who refused to submit to questioning abouta series of bombings in Paris.   ``Never would we have imagined seeing the 1,000 days,'' saidKauffmann's mother, Odette. ``I never thought myself capable offacing such a test.''</TEXT></DOC>
