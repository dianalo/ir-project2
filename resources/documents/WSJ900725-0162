Most of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries'ministers on hand for the opening of meetings here todayarrived convinced they can reduce their combined outputsufficiently to boost oil prices until demand picks up laterthis year.</LP><TEXT>   However, the meeting is starting against an unsettlingbackdrop. Iraq, which blames Kuwait and the United ArabEmirates for this year's oil-price fall, has reportedlystationed troops on the Kuwaiti border. That move follows avociferous verbal attack on Kuwait last week by Iraq'sPresident Saddam Hussein, asserting that overproduction byKuwait and the UAE have caused Iraq economic damage. Pentagonofficials confirmed that U.S. warships have been put on alertin the Persian Gulf because of mounting friction there.   The discord between Iraq and Kuwait was immediatelyapparent as their oil ministers here seemed to be far aparton what OPEC's new pricing and production goals ought to be.   Kuwait's new oil minister, Rasheed Salem Al-Ameeri,wouldn't comment, but he has pledged to help increase oilprices by reducing Kuwait's output to its quota of 1.5million barrels a day. In return, Kuwait would get a higherquota when demand picks up for OPEC oil later this year. TheUAE has made a similar pledge after a meeting of the PersianGulf producers in Saudi Arabia earlier this month.   But, delegates here said, Kuwait supports only an increasein the average price of OPEC oil to the previously targeted$18 a barrel from the current average of about $16.50.   By contrast, Issam Abdul Raheem AlChalabi, Iraq's oilminister, arrived repeating a call for the OPEC benchmarkprice to be increased to $25 a barrel. &quot;We are aiming for anagreement that will make the prices firm up to the level wehave announced,&quot; Mr. Al-Chalabi said. Libya's chief delegatealso supported the $25 target, though most others suggestedthat currently it was out of reach.   Hisham Nazer, the Saudi oil minister, declined to give apricing target except to say that he supports a higher price.He also was among those predicting that the tensions betweenIraq and Kuwait wouldn't affect disccusions here. &quot;We arehere to solve oil problems,&quot; Mr. Nazer said.   Persian Gulf sources suggested Saudi Arabia might bewilling to accept an OPEC target price of $18 to $20 abarrel. Iran's minister, and a number of others, want a $20price.   The proposal announced two weeks ago in Saudi Arabiaappeared to offer solutions to the price issue. It called fora slight increase in OPEC's production ceiling, now 22.1million barrels a day, to 22.4 million or 22.5 million, butthat would be far below recent output levels as high as 24million.   The increase in the official ceiling would allow a higherquota of 1.5 million barrels a day for the UAE, matching thatof Kuwait's. However, both have produced as much as twomillion barrels a day earlier this year.   Delegates from Saudi Arabia said that proposal hasn't beenchanged by the Iraq-Kuwait dispute. Others also said theystill expect OPEC production to be cut to under 23 millionbarrels a day. They don't agree on whether the new ceilingshould remain in effect for the rest of the year or just forthe remainder of this quarter.   A report by OPEC's economist to the ministers today willaddress that issue. OPEC's meetings begin this afternoon witha session of its eight-member monitoring committee; the fullconference starts tomorrow. Some delegates said they stillexpect this meeting to end within two or three days.</TEXT></DOC>
