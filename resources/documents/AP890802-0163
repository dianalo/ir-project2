The Federal Home Loan Bank Board, in a decision late Tuesday,said Home Federal Savings and Loan Association of San Diego couldleave the insolvent Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp.   Home Federal is only one of several big Sandamp;Ls trying to escapeFSLIC and join the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., the commercialbank fund which charges its members less for the same federalinsurance of $100,000 per account.   But, before the Sandamp;L can become HomeFed Bank, it must securepermission from California Sandamp;L and bank regulators and from theFDIC, a process expected to take at least several months.   The bank board's decision is generating criticism in Congress,which hopes to pass legislation this week committing taxpayers tospending billions of dollars to bail out the Sandamp;L industry.   As part of the price for the bailout, Sandamp;Ls will continue to payhigher insurance premiums than banks for the next five years, evenif they convert to a bank.   Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., a member of the House BankingCommittee, said regulators may have had no choice but to rule infavor of Home Federal. But, he added, ``I think it's awful. Itsends a terrible signal. ... If there was a legal way to avoid thedecision, it should have been done.''   Home Federal is hoping to get out of FSLIC under a provision of1987 banking legislation that permits institutions to leaveprovided they applied before March 31, 1987. Home Federal filed itsapplications to the FDIC and state regulators a day before thedeadline.   It is unclear, however, if that loophole will still be good ifHome Federal, as expected, is unable to complete its conversionbefore Congress enacts new Sandamp;L legislation, which has provisionsthat would supersede the law passed two years ago.   John Buchman, a bank board staff attorney, said the Home Federaldecision will not set a precedent favorable to several other largeSandamp;Ls trying to bolt the FSLIC.   Two Los Angeles-based Sandamp;Ls _ Home Savings of America and GreatWestern, the largest and second-largest thrifts in the nation _ arealso trying to leave FSLIC.   The bank board denied Great Western's application and, in June,the thrift lost an attempt to overturn the decision in U.S.District Court in Los Angeles. It is appealing the ruling.   The bank board has until October to rule on the application fromHome Savings of America.   The bank board has allowed 13 other Sandamp;Ls to secede from theFSLIC under the 1987 law, all considerably smaller than HomeFederal.   Home Federal, ranked eighth in the nation with $17.2 billion inassets at the end of May, has about 200 branches throughoutCalifornia. Last year, it paid $13.7 million more in insurancepremiums than it would have as a bank.   Both bank and Sandamp;L premiums would be raised under the Sandamp;L bill,but Home Federal would still pay about $9 million less in premiumsas a bank.</TEXT></DOC>
