(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A Titan 34D rocketthundered into space with a secret cargo during the weekend, and oneexpert said it probably carried a pair of military communicationsatellites into orbit.   The 16-story-tall booster blasted off Sunday morning, said AirForce Capt. John Sullivan, a spokesman for the sprawling Vandenbergmilitary base on the coast 140 miles northwest of Los Angeles.   As usual for military space flights, the Air Force didn'tannounce the launch in advance and declined to identify its payload.   However, it most likely carried two Satellite Data Systemsatellites, although it also might have carried either a KH-9 orKH-11 photo reconnaissance satellite, said John Pike, a space policyexpert for the Washington-based Federation of American Scientists.   Pike, who knew about the launch in advance, said Friday the datasystem satellites are used for military communications.   The satellites provide ``a way for the president to stay in touchwith our nuclear forces ... to give bombers and (silo-based crewsoperating) missiles the `go code''' to launch nuclear warheads, hesaid.   Pike said two SDS satellites were ``launched five years ago.They're due for replacement.''   SDS and KH-series satellites are the only types launched fromVandenberg on Titan 34Ds, he said.   ``The reason I think it's SDS is I don't think the Air Force hasany more KH-9s or KH-11s,'' Pike said.   The Titan 34D, America's most powerful space booster, will besupplanted by the Titan 4, due for its maiden launch next year fromCape Canaveral, Fla.   The last launch of a Titan 34D was from Cape Canaveral on Sept.2, but sources told The Associated Press it failed to place itspayload in orbit.   Pike described that payload as a satellite designed to monitorSoviet missile tests and radio, telephone, radar and otherelectronic communications.   Two Titan 34Ds were launched successfully in late 1987. Beforethen, they were grounded following two straight explosions duringlaunches on Aug. 28, 1985, and April 18, 1986, destroying a KH-11and a KH-9.</TEXT></DOC>
