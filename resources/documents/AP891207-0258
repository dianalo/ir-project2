Delors appealed to the leaders to move forward withcontroversial plans to forge a tighter economic and monetary unionof the dozen nations, known as the Common Market.   He urged EC leaders, who will meet Friday and Saturday, to set adate for a special conference to revise the community's foundingtreaty and create the monetary union.   At the summit, the leaders also were expected to discuss plansto adopt a social charter guaranteeing minimum rights to workers inthe European-wide market to be established in 1992. Also on theagenda was a French plan to set up a development bank to providemoney to East European countries adopting political and economicreforms.   In addition, the leaders may discuss a proposal announced lastmonth that the EC form a closer relationship with the six EuropeanFree Trade Association countries.   Under the proposal by the EC's executive commission, the sixEFTA nations _ Austria, Iceland, Finland, Norway, Sweden andSwitzerland _ would gain freedom of movement for people, goods,services and capital with the EC, in effect creating a vast openEuropean market.   Nico Wegter, the EC foreign affairs spokesman, said last monththe 12 EC foreign ministers agreed that on Dec. 19, when they meettheir EFTA colleagues, they should take ``a clear politicalcommitment so that we can begin negotiations next year.''   Cooperation between the two trade blocs also would bestrengthened in the areas of research, environment, consumerprotection, working conditions, social welfare, education andforeign policy under the proposal.   French President Francois Mitterrand, the summit host, wants theStrasbourg meeting to schedule the inter-governmental conference onmonetary union for the second half of 1990.   A West German government official said Thursday that ChancellorHelmut Kohl _ who wants the conference begun after late 1990 Germanelections _ would agree to formally launching the conference inDecember 1990, providing work did not begin until 1991.   British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher strongly has opposedradical plans for monetary union, which would lead to a jointcurrency and a European-wide system of central banks. She also hasopposed setting a timetable for the special conference.   But Mitterrand was expected to push hard for a decision to holdthe conference next fall.   ``It is on this that the success or failure of the Strasbourgsummit will be judged,'' said a French official in Paris, demandinganonymity. ``It is a risk, but the situation in Eastern Europeforces us to take it.''   Delors and others argue that the upheavals in the East requirethe Common Market to move more quickly in uniting on economic andother issues. U.S. President George Bush has urged the trading blocto be ``a magnet that draws the forces of reform forward in EasternEurope.''   But Mrs. Thatcher argues that the sweeping plans for monetaryunion would require governments to surrender some of theirsovereignty.   She reiterated her opposition at Monday's North Atlantic TreatyOrganization summit in Brussels, saying such a system ``is not astep toward democracy but a step away from it.''   French officials were worried that West Germany would hesitatein supporting full European integration. The opening of bordersbetween East and West Germany, has raised concern that Bonn'sattention may shift to its Eastern neighbors.   French Foreign Minister Roland Dumas said France expected WestGermany to show ``irrefutable proof'' of its support for Europeanintegration.   A West German source, demanding anonymity, said at the NATOgathering that ``We must make clear in Strasbourg that West Germanyis interested in the further economic and monetary integration ofEurope.''   Moves for a monetary union have added another dimension to theEuropean Community's plans to fashion a single market by the end of1992. By then, the nations want to remove the many trade barriersthat prevent the free movement of people, goods, services and money.   The special conference would be needed to revise the Treaty ofRome, which set up the Common Market in 1957. The treaty would haveto be altered to put into effect some of the recommendations forcloser monetary ties, made in a report by a group of centralbankers.   The report proposed setting up a new agency to make andimplement monetary policy and to manage exchange rate policy. Italso recommended that a single currency eventually be created, witheach nation abandoning its present currency.   At a June summit in Madrid, the EC leaders agreed to proceedwith the first stage of a three-part plan. The first stage,scheduled to begin July 1, would link all the EC currencies to theEuropean monetary mechanism that keeps exchange rates for thosecurrencies roughly stable within a certain range.   The currencies of Britain, Greece and Portugal are not now partof that system.</TEXT></DOC>
