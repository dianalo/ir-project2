Opposition leaders formed a new organization to challenge thehard-line Communist government.   East Germany accused Bonn of enticing the refugees and comparedit to the ``Home to the Reich'' slogan used during the Naziexpansionism in the 1930s.   Despite appeals for reforms to slow the refugee flow, EastGermany has hardened its stance.   That included the cancellation Friday of a planned visit by WestGermany's left-leaning Social Democrats, who traditionally havepleaded for better relations with East Berlin. President HorstSindermann accused the Social Democrats of planning a``confrontation'' next week with the Communist government.   Most of the East Germans who have left since Hungary opened itsborder to the West at midnight Sunday are young, well-educatedpeople.   East German Central Committee member Harry Tisch said thegoverment will have to find ways to bridge the gap resulting fromtheir loss.   ``It certainly won't be easy,'' Tisch said during a visit toStuttgart. ``Naturally, it's not unproblematical for us that skilledworkers, whether young or old, from the German Democratic Republicare resettling in the Federal Republic of Germany.''   Tisch, who heads the 9.5-million member state labor union,claimed there were no official plans to restrict East Germans'travels to Hungary. However, sources in East Berlin have said thatit has become more difficult to get permission to travel to EastGermany's Warsaw Pact ally.   Also Friday, 12 well known opposition leaders, includingphysicist Hans-Juergen Fischbeck, announced the formation of the``Citizens Initiative for Democracy Now.''   The group signed a petition demanding ``widespread reformsnationwide.''   The Central Committee member in charge of the East German economyrejected all such calls, including those coming from the West Germangovernment and the Social Democrats.   ``The reform proposals of those people contain only one point:they want the type of reform that does away with socialism,'' theofficial, Guenter Mittag, wrote in the Communist Party dailynewspaper Neues Deutschland. ``It just won't be that way!''   He called on those left behind to do everything possible tostrengthen the nation.   Mittag also bitterly attacked West Germany.   ``With promises, enticements and also with psychologicalpressure, they have organized a movement along the well known modelof `Home to the Reich,''' Mittag wrote. ``Have they forgotten whatthat led to?''   ``Home to the Reich'' was used as a slogan for the Nazis' aims tounite all Germans living in Central Europe and Eastern Europe intoAdolf Hitler's Third Reich.</TEXT></DOC>
