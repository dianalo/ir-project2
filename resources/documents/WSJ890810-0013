The OTC market is &quot;going to have a bit of a struggle through the mountaintops because of the combination of profit-taking and nervousness,&quot; said Ralph Costanza, head of OTC trading at Smith Barney, Harris Upham andamp; Co.    But he and other traders say the correction won't be a prolonged one. &quot;This is just a little pause -- a regrouping,&quot; Mr. Costanza said. &quot;The buyers will come back.&quot;    Most of the profit-taking was in the technology stocks that dominate the OTC market and have been attracting buyers in the latest rally.    Smith Barney yesterday added Intel to the list of stocks it recommends for purchase. Mr. Costanza said the firm has relatively few technology issues on its recommended list and is &quot;looking for values to single out.&quot; He added: &quot;I think investors are doing the same thing.&quot;    Intel, however, fell 1 1/2 to 31 1/2 on 1.5 million shares. Late Tuesday, another semiconductor maker, closely held Atmel, filed suit against Intel in federal court charging a violation of antitrust laws. The suit was a response to a request that Intel filed in July with the International Trade Commission asking for an investigation of whether Atmel was violating an earlier commission ruling on memory chips called Eproms.    Nasdaq volume yesterday totaled 155.7 million shares, with 1,033 issues declining in price and 999 advancing. About 4,400 issues were traded. Average daily volume so far this month stands at 142.6 million shares. If that pace is sustained, August will overtake May as the OTC market's busiest month this year; May had average daily turnover of about 140 million shares.    MCI Communications dropped 1 to 37 on 2.9 million shares. This week, American Telephone andamp; Telegraph filed a complaint with the Federal Communications Commission charging that MCI violated communications law by failing to give the FCC details of major proposals to serve big business customers. MCI called the complaint &quot;a smokescreen.&quot;    SHL Systemhouse rose 5/8 to 9 1/4 on 225,000 shares. The developer of computer-based information systems said it plans a rights offering to raise $116 million Canadian (US$99 million).    Under the offering, owners of each share of record next Thursday will receive one right. Five rights entitle the holder to purchase two common shares at C$11 each until Sept. 7.    If all rights are exercised, the company said, 10.7 million shares will be issued. The company currently has 26.8 million shares outstanding.    Gtech gained 3/4 to 16 on 680,000 shares. The maker of computer-based lottery systems said it signed a definitive agreement to be acquired by an investor group including some members of its management and Donaldson, Lufkin andamp; Jenrette Capital for $16.63 a share.    Doskocil improved 3/4 to 11 5/8. The company said WFC Acquisition agreed to pay $150 million for Doskocil's Wilson Foods division, increased from $140 million WFC Acquisition earlier said it would pay.    Manitowoc jumped 1 1/2 to 24 on 227,100 shares. The maker of cranes earned $6.5 million, or 63 cents, in its fourth quarter, after a loss of about $6 million a year earlier.    Carrington Laboratories rose 1 to 39. The company announced late Tuesday that it bought a factory in Texas for producing its experimental drug Carrisyn, which it expects to sell as a treatment for acquired immune deficiency syndrome, among other things. Carrisyn is derived from the aloe vera plant.    Medstone International advanced 1 3/4 to 19 1/2 on 218,300 shares. There was speculation that the company's machine for dissolving gallstones might be considered for approval at an October meeting of a Food and Drug Administration panel, according to Dow Jones Professional Investor Report.    Two OTC trucking issues advanced in active trading after a Merrill Lynch analyst made positive comments about several companies in the industry.    Yellow Freight System improved 7/8 to 30 3/8 on 426,000 shares, and Roadway Services was up 3/4 to 37 3/4 on nearly 300,000 shares. </TEXT></DOC>
