Late in New York, the dollar was quoted at 1.8060 marks,down from 1.8265 marks late Friday in New York. The U.S.currency was also changing hands at 138.55 yen, up from138.30 yen. Sterling was trading at $1.6345, up from $1.6173.</LP><TEXT>   In Tokyo early Tuesday, the dollar was trading at 138.75yen, unchanged from Monday's close. Meanwhile, the U.S.currency was trading at 1.8144 marks, down a bit from 1.8188marks at Tokyo's close Monday.   The dollar was hit as European currencies shook free ofbearish factors, such as unrest in Yugoslavia and concernsabout a new tax on German interest income -- that dragged onthem last week, foreign exchange dealers said.   The dollar also suffered slightly from concerns thatGermany might boost interest rates Thursday; from last week'stepid U.S. employment report; and from the perception thatthe U.S. unit was due for a technical correction, they added.   &quot;The market was just ahead of itself&quot; in buying thedollar, said Charles Spence, corporate foreign exchangemanager at First Interstate Bank of California in LosAngeles.   Traders said they expect the dollar to continue to riseafter pausing for a day or two to allow traders to takeprofits and buy more dollars at lower levels.   &quot;I've seen little fundamentally or technically that wouldstop the dollar from going higher,&quot; said a trader at aforeign bank in New York. Most of the investment fundmanagers he deals with said they have &quot;no problem&quot; holdingdollars at this level, he added.   The yen came under pressure early in the global day asJapan's Finance Ministry announced it would bar the country'stop securities companies from trading for corporate accountsfor four days starting Wednesday as punishment forcompensating major customers for stock market losses.   Expectations of such sanctions prompted a 722.17-pointdrop in Tokyo's Nikkei index of 225 selected shares beforethe decision was announced.   Later, during European trading, the market resonated withconcerns that the Deutsche Bundesbank would tighten monetarypolicy at Thursday's regular Central Bank Council meeting,the last before the summer recess.   The two factors together tipped the balance between themark and yen. Traders who last week were short, or oversold,in the German currency scrambled to cover those positions andto unload yen, said First Interstate's Mr. Spence.   &quot;There's great anticipation that the Bundesbank will raiseinterest rates {Thursday} and that's making people concernedabout being short marks,&quot; Mr. Spence said.   The market was inclined last week to sell the mark and buythe yen, as concerns about a withholding tax on interestincome in Germany and unrest in Yugoslavia underminedconfidence in the German unit.   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for currentdelivery settled at $370.90 an ounce, up 70 cents. Estimatedvolume was a light two million ounces.   In Hong Kong early Tuesday, gold was quoted at $370.20 anounce.</TEXT></DOC>
