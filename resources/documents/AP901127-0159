He refused to say whether China will veto it or abstain.   As one of the five permanent members of the U.N. SecurityCouncil, China has veto power over any resolution. It has voted forall 10 previous resolutions that seek to pressure Iraq to end itsnearly 4-month-old occupation of Kuwait, but has expressed greatreluctance to see force used.   ``It has always been the position of China to call for apeaceful settlement,'' Qian told reporters at the Beijing airportwhile preparing to leave for the United States to cast China'svote.   Qian said reports in the United States that China will supportthe force resolution have ``no basis.''   Asked if he meant China will not vote for the resolution, Qiansaid, ``I think so.''   Asked specifically it he planned to veto, he replied, ``I havenot said so,'' then added, ``I think you will know after I cast thevote. I will not say anything beforethen.''   He may plan to press Washington for concessions before agreeingto abstain. Qian said he will meet with U.S. Secretary of StateJames A. Baker III on Wednesday night before Thursday's U.N.Security Council session.   Among concessions he may seek, China wants the United States toallow the World Bank to resume normal lending to China, and to liftremaining sanctions imposed after China's June 1989 army attack onpro-democracy protesters.   Qian's visit will be the first official visit by a Chineseminister since then.</TEXT></DOC>
