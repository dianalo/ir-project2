The court's unanimous action apparently means the law, blockedfrom taking effect Jan. 1 by a Superior Court judge's order, willremain unenforced this year while its constitutionality ischallenged.   Major doctors' organizations and family-planning groups contendthe law violates the right to privacy under the state Constituionby restricting minors' ability to decide on their own whether togive birth or get an abortion.   The law, sponsored by anti-abortion groups, would make it acrime for a doctor to perform an abortion on an unmarried minorliving at home who did not have written consent from one parent.   As an alternative to parental consent, the minor could get aruling from a judge, after a confidential hearing, that theabortion was in her best interest or that she was mature enough tomake the decision on her own.   State officials say about 34,000 women under 18 had abortions in1985, the latest year for which figures are available. Under theold law, which remains in effect, a woman of any age can consent toan abortion as long as her doctor concludes she understands theprocedure and is consenting voluntarily.   San Francisco Superior Court Judge Morton Colvin issued apreliminary injunction Dec. 28 prohibiting enforcement of the newlaw until a trial could be held on its constitutionality. He saidthe law would cause irreparable harm if enforced in the meantime,and found a reasonable likelihood it would ultimately be ruledinvalid.   The state's 1st District Court of Appeal let Colvin's orderstand. Attorney General John Van de Kamp, the lead defendant in thesuit as the state's top law enforcement officer, then appealed tothe state Supreme Court, asking the court to take over the case andto allow enforcement of the law while the suit is pending.</TEXT></DOC>
