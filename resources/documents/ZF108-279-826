 Stone directedofficials to review the possibility of exporting reusable Ada softwarepackages from the Worldwide Military Command and Control System to the otherservices (WWMCCS).andP;  Feliciano Giordano, the Army's program executive officer(PEO) for strategic information systems, said that later a Defense Departmentworking group began looking into integrating the software with the service'sbattlefield computer architecture.andM;The efforts are designed to take advantage of technology and political trendsthat are beginning to blur distinctions between information, strategic andtactical automation systems.andM;&quot;The idea is to ensure that we have commonality and that we don't haveduplication [among services],&quot; Giordano said.andP;  In addition to its jointservices uses, Giordano said the new software is being developed to allow theArmy to link its version of WWMCCS to battlefield systems through newhardware that runs UNIX.andM;Ada Is EverywhereandM;The widespread acceptance of UNIX and the advent of Ada have helped diminishdistinctions among the military's different types of systems.andP;  For example,Ada engineering principles are just as applicable in developing a financialmanagement system as a tactical fire-support system, Giordano said.andM;These lines are beginning to blur so much that some members of the MajorAutomated Information Systems Review Committee have proposed that MAISRCreview most hardware contracts and all software contracts whether they arefor information, strategic or battlefield systems, a DOD official said.andM;If so, the official said, computer systems that in the past have been treatedas &quot;weapons systems&quot; and software termed &quot;mission critical&quot; will come underthe same oversight authority as a payroll or personnel system.andM;WWMCCS is DOD's strategic automation system by which military commands reporttheir readiness for combat to the Pentagon.andM;Because it is mainly a database system, it also serves daily administrativefunctions in personnel, logistics, management and other areas.andM;Several key projects are under way to upgrade WWMCCS hardware and software.andO;The upgrade once was known as the WWMCCS Information System (WIS) project butnow is the WWMCCS Automated Data Processing Modernization (WAM) program.andM;Coordinated by DCAandM;The Army, Navy and Air Force each have upgrade programs, but the DefenseCommunications Agency coordinates the overall WAM.andM;According to a program summary provided by the Army's Information SystemsSelection and Acquisition Agency, Ada-related contract work under the Army'sprogram began with a January 1987 award to TRW Inc.andM;The company was to &quot;study, analyze and design&quot; Ada packages.andP;  The contractalso included development, testing, integration and installation of the Adasoftware at eight Army sites worldwide.andM;The Army has spent $51.7 million of a possible $156 million on the TRWcontract, which extends to April 1993.andM;Giordano said the Army has reduced overall WWMCCS code &quot;by a ratio of aboutfour-to-one.&quot;andP;  He said the project is one of the service's largest&quot;non-embedded Ada projects&quot; and that overall program costs will not exceed$100 million.andM;Pursuing a DreamandM;Giordano said he meets about every three months with Maj.andP;  Gen.andP;  Peter Kind,the PEO for tactical automation, &quot;to find ways we can have information thatwould come directly from the battlefield to decision-makers.&quot;andP;  He said such ascenario &quot;is a dream, but we're pursuing it.&quot;andM;As part of that pursuit, Giordano said, the Army plans to link two subsystemsunder the Army Tactical Command and Control System and the Army WIS.andM;The ATCCS Maneuver Control System and the WIS-based U.S.andP;  Army EuropeTactical Command and Control System will operate in tandem on the CommonHardware/Software (CHS) suite of UNIX micros provided by Miltope Corp. andHewlett-Packard Co.andM;CHS was the Army's first large purchase of off-the-shelf computers meant forthe tactical arena.andP;  Giordano said he believes that Ada is among the keycomponents of new integration possibilities.andP;  He said Ada design processesforced the Army &quot;to document our requirements with seriousness.&quot;andM;Common FunctionsandM;As well, the TRW contract coincided with the unification of several ArmyWWMCCS-related efforts under PEO management in 1987.andM;&quot;In the past, how did we develop software?andP;  We'd place a group of people inone command and say, 'Automate the functions that go on here.'andM;&quot;But the analysis required on the front end of the Ada development programgave us a chance to look for common functions across all commands.andP;  The nextstep in that process was to identify the functions in generic modules thatwould be available to all commands.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
