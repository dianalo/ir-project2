Off to his right sprawled the factory where rival RockwellInternational Corp. once assembled B-1 bombers; these days,under a leftover banner proclaiming &quot;Progress for Peace,&quot; itupgrades commercial jetliners instead. Nearby, Northrop Corp.builds the radar-evading B-2 Stealth bomber; but with theWarsaw Pact collapse, the factory has barely escaped beingmothballed by lawmakers eager for a peace dividend.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;This is one of the last enclaves of military aviation,&quot;Mr. Mullin mused. &quot;And you've got to wonder how long it canlast.&quot;   Longer than ever, it suddenly seems, now that the world ison the brink of war again. Defense contractors, although waryof jumping the gun, clearly view Iraq's thrust into Kuwaitand the U.S.'s launch of Operation Desert Shield as amuch-needed transfusion for their moribund businesses.   &quot;The Iraqi invasion will really stimulate thought abouthow we should be armed 10, 20, 30 years from now,&quot; says Mr.Mullin, a beefy, straight-talking Lockheed veteran who'sdeveloping what the company hopes will become the Air Force'snext generation of jet fighter. &quot;The military services hadtried to articulate that there are other threats out therebesides Russia. But nobody, including Congress, seemedconvinced. What's happening now is pivotal.&quot;   Lockheed figures to be featured prominently in any debateover how the U.S. should shape its arsenal of the future. Asthe builder of the C-5 and C-141 transport aircraft that havehauled more than five billion pounds of material to thePersian Gulf in the past six weeks, the company stands tobenefit, long term, from a renewed call for more airliftcapability. In particular, the four-engine C-130 Herculestransport -- which the company had envisioned dribbling outat three a month -- could be destined for a faster rate ofproduction.   More immediately, McDonnell Douglas Corp.'s new C-17military cargo plane, which is being riveted together insidea giant Long Beach, Calif., factory, has gained some clout.&quot;We need a fast, mobile system that can move people rightinto a combat area,&quot; says Bob Bresette, deputy generalmanager of the program, sounding a theme that many outsideobservers say has become an easier sell to Capitol Hill.Indeed, although the C-17 has been beleaguered by costoverruns and delays, supporters contend that it is perfectfor snuffing out Third World conflagrations because of itsability to carry 167,000 pounds of equipment 2,400 nauticalmiles and then land on a short, remote strip of land.   Similarly, demand is certain to increase for cargo ships,particularly swift ones.   Litton Industries Inc. recently completed a study for theNavy on &quot;fast sea-lift&quot; vessels that could tote 20,000 tonsof personnel and gear at speeds as high as 55 knots, twice asfast as today's cargo ships. &quot;We're looking at the Mideast asan important opportunity,&quot; says Gerald St. Pe, the executivein charge of the company's giant Ingalls shipyard inMississippi.   Perhaps the biggest boon, however, will be for thosecompanies adept at exporting their goods. The Bushadministration, trying to fortify its Mideast allies,disclosed last week that it plans to sell new arms valued atabout $20 billion to Saudi Arabia. The cache, which comes onthe heels of a $2 billion deal with the Saudis, is likely toinclude 17 Lockheed C-130s; 24 F-15 fighters and 48 Apacheattack helicopters, built by McDonnell Douglas; about 700 M-1battle tanks made by General Dynamics Corp., including somepreviously committed; Raytheon Co.'s Patriot ground-to-airmissiles; Bradley Fighting Vehicles, a product of FMC Corp.;as well as training, communications and support equipment.Already, Israel is demanding parity with Saudi Arabia, whichwould generate even more business abroad for U.S. companies.   Still, how any of this will translate to the bottom line-- and when -- is uncertain. Iraq or not, the militaryestablishment remains in the midst of its steepest nose divein 40 years.   The melting away of the Cold War is still going to cause arapid decline in the military budget, tens of thousands oflayoffs across the country and a continuing exodus ofcompanies doing business with the Pentagon. Phillip Karber,of BDM Corp., which counsels the Pentagon on technicalissues, points out that with the cost of deploying andmaintaining a force in the Mideast expected to run about $1billion a month, there simply may be no money left for newweapons development.   Nevertheless, in due course, Congress and the DefenseDepartment &quot;will shift their attention to lessons learned inthe Mideast,&quot; predicts Michael Rich, vice president fornational security at Rand Corp., the think tank. That changein focus, he suggests, will affect &quot;not only the level offuture defense budgets, but their composition as well.&quot;   There is little mystery to where the money might go. Inmany ways, the Mideast situation only underscores conceptsthat have long been evolving inside arms makers' laboratoriesand research centers.   Joe Falkner, a manager with Colsa Corp., an El Paso,Texas, company that is advising the Army on the kinds ofairborne weapons needed on the battlefield of the future,notes: &quot;What's going on in the Middle East is that we'restaring at short- to medium-range tactical missiles. And inthe past, we've thought about how you see them and interceptthem.&quot; Yet traditionally, Mr. Falkner says, &quot;by the time thedefense budget has been completed,&quot; development money toexplore this area more thoroughly &quot;is usually what fallsout.&quot;   William Perry, Pentagon research chief during the Carteradministration, says the Defense Department has been sointent on developing the Strategic Defense Initiative, aspace-based missile shield to thwart Soviet warheads, thatmoney for less exotic but more practical ground-based systems&quot;just sort of dried up.&quot;   Lockheed, General Motors Corp.'s Hughes Aircraft division,Rockwell, Boeing Co. and TRW Inc. -- all of which have beenmajor players in SDI research -- may benefit if new fundingis allocated for a more down-to-earth anti-missile network.   The key to any advanced weapons system, experts say, liesin the continued development of high-tech electronics. Thatbodes well for companies such as Loral Corp., E-Systems Inc.and Hughes, leaders in outfitting missiles with sensors andjet fighters with radar-warning receivers and jamminginstruments. &quot;One of the advantages of modern electronics isthat they're reliable,&quot; explains Peter Oram, who runs GrummanCorp.'s aircraft division. &quot;That means fewer people, fewerparts and less test equipment.&quot;   The Pentagon will require lighter, more flexible weapons.Retired Army Gen. Donald Keith, while arguing for a balancebetween heavy and light forces, singles out the service's&quot;armored gun system,&quot; a tank that would be about half theweight of a 65-ton M-1 Abrams. Although FMC, GeneralDynamics, Teledyne Inc. and Textron Inc.'s Cadillac Gage unithave done some design studies on it, &quot;the system never madethe priority cut when those tough budget choices had to bemade,&quot; says Gen. Keith, president of Cypress International,which advises contractors on Randamp;D decisions. &quot;Now, it probablywill.&quot;   U.S. troops also will need superior ground protection.Such is the aim of the Fox reconnaissance vehicle, which isdesigned to provide protection from nuclear, biological andchemical blasts. Already, more than 1,000 Fox chassis havebeen produced by Thyssen Henschel, a West German company, andthe Pentagon wants General Dynamics to begin upgrading thoseand then build its own by 1994.   For many contractors, the military's changing mandate willoffer both pluses and minuses. At Lockheed, for instance, thestrong support it has enjoyed on Capitol Hill for itsstrategic Trident II missile could conceivably wane. Othercompanies producing nuclear weapons and their components,including Boeing, Rockwell and Northrop, may face similarroadblocks.   Moreover, bringing any new weapon from the drawing boardto the trenches is a slow and risky process for defenseconcerns, which find themselves subject to the vagaries ofpoliticians, generals and Wall Street. &quot;You can't scrapeverything and suddenly change direction overnight,&quot; saysDaniel Tellep, Lockheed's chairman.   For one thing, systems are so technically complexnowadays, it takes years to get them to work right. And whenthey slip behind schedule -- as they almost always do -- itleads to hand-wringing by lawmakers, who are then inclined totake a whack at the program budget. That slows progress evenmore.   In addition, many corporations have been burned by puttingup lots of money to design a new weapon only to have thegovernment decide it doesn't really want such a gizmo afterall. And should a company get too pushy, it risks offending amonolithic market: The Defense Department is known amongPentagon suppliers simply and deferentially as The Customer.   &quot;You try and listen very carefully and help the militarypeople understand what is possible,&quot; says George Heilmeier,senior vice president and chief technical officer at TexasInstruments Corp. But in the end, he says, &quot;it's a jugglingact.&quot;   The Dallas company has proven more dexterous than many ofits competitors. For instance, it recently won a contract tomake a light, shoulder-fired tank destroyer known as theAAWS-M. &quot;It would drive the Iraqis nuts,&quot; says Mr. Heilmeier.</TEXT></DOC>
