And that's good newsfor entrepreneurs who rely on the regionals to arrange andfinance acquisitions and other strategic deals.   Not long ago, Wall Street investment bankers routinelysniffed at small companies; many still do. So when Bradley S.Scott was looking to sell his Los Angeles Auto Salvage Inc.last year, he retained Sutro andamp; Co., a West Coast firm.&quot;There's a great deal of hand-holding that goes on in sellinga company, and it was important to me to have the kind ofclose contact that I got with Sutro,&quot; says Mr. Scott, whosecompany sold for less than $20 million.   A plethora of such small transactions is adding up to realmoney, say regional bankers happily removed from WallStreet's slump. &quot;I go to cocktail parties, and the WallStreet guys say it's tough out there, and we say it's great,&quot;says Lloyd Greif, vice chairman of Sutro.   The regionals' bread and butter is deals between smallercompanies. And with smaller companies thriving, manyregionals' business has never been better. Likewise, becausefew big deals are getting done and so much attention is beingfocused on the smaller transactions, it's a seller's marketfor middle-market companies, whose annual sales fall anywherebetween $10 million and $300 million. Even at some regionalfirms still in the doldrums, things are looking up.   Only last month, Advest Group Inc., Hartford, Conn.,completed a $10 million convertible-debenture offering forO'Brien Energy Systems Inc., Philadelphia. The offering,originally set for $25 million, was to have been co-managedby Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. But Drexel's parent, DrexelBurnham Lambert Group Inc., filed for bankruptcy-lawprotection Feb. 13 and has said it plans to liquidate itsassets.   &quot;We were able to go back to the client and say we'd liketo continue to perform on this,&quot; Allen Weintraub, Advest'spresident, says. &quot;That's proof that things can be doneregionally, even when your New York partner is unable.&quot;   Doing things regionally has never been more lucrative,many investment bankers say. Sutro's corporate-financeactivity, for example, has grown rapidly -- to 19transactions last year totaling $1.47 billion from 11 in 1987totaling $263 million. With Wall Street now averse to highleverage and high risk, the mergers and other transactionsstill getting done are generally below $250 million in value.&quot;That's right up the regionals' alley,&quot; Mr. Greif says.   To be sure, not all regionals are seeing their businessmushroom; among other reasons, some firms have strongcompetition in their regions, and in some parts of thecountry, such as the Southwest, the economy is relativelysluggish.   &quot;I guess it's going to be another slow year. I don't thinkwe're going to shoot the lights out,&quot; says James C. BradfordJr., senior partner of J.C. Bradford andamp; Co., Nashville, Tenn.William Blair andamp; Co., Chicago, hasn't seen the kind of mergerand acquisition activity it had before the October 1987stock-market crash. &quot;It's clearly a slow period, and we hopethe future is going to be better,&quot; says David Coolidge,partner in charge of corporate finance.   Regionals -- which normally are based well outside NewYork and concentrate on clients close to home -- promotethemselves as being more attuned to the needs of smallclients than is Wall Street. &quot;The regionals are closer to thebusinesses that are doing the transactions, not onlygeographically but also in temperament,&quot; says RichardHimelfarb, executive vice president of Legg Mason Wood WalkerInc., a Baltimore concern that does transactions in the $10million to $100 million range.   The top people at regional firms routinely pay personalattention to clients. &quot;In New York, they'll get a junior manworking on their case,&quot; says Chris Covington, a partner ofVolpe, Covington andamp; Welty, a 50-person San Francisco firm.&quot;Here, they get a senior person laboring in the fields withthem.&quot;   Nevertheless, it can take considerable salesmanship for aregional firm to attract business. &quot;Frankly, I think clientsare still overly in love with New York, and they don't reallyunderstand why that's not necessarily the best place for themto do their business,&quot; says R. Hunt Greene, managing directorof Piper Jaffray Inc., Minneapolis. &quot;We spend a lot of timeeducating them about our track record,&quot; which includesfinancing work done for St. Jude Medical Inc., St. Paul,Minn., and the current sale of Deltak Corp., Minneapolis.   Wall Street's preoccupation with huge transactions hasgiven the regionals a clear-cut advantage in the currentmarket, Mr. Greene says. Though trying to shore up businessnow, the Wall Street firms still generally neglect the middlemarket. &quot;The result is that we've had a wide-open field,&quot; Mr.Greene says of the regionals.   Moreover, as Wall Street lays off investment bankers indroves, many of the regional firms are seizing the moment toimprove their own staffs. Sutro plans to add at least sevennew professionals this year to its corporate-finance officesin San Francisco and Los Angeles, a 50% increase. &quot;Thisexpansion is warranted -- in fact, necessitated -- by thecurrent surge in middle-market transactions that we areexperiencing,&quot; Mr. Greif says.   The firms that are doing well aren't being bashful aboutit. If they seem a tad boastful these days, it's because manyof them spent most of the past decade watching from afar asthe big firms feasted on the fattest deals. &quot;The businessboom that went on on Wall Street didn't materialize to thesame degree in the regions,&quot; says Jim Pierpont, senior vicepresident, corporate finance, at Minneapolis-based DainBosworth Inc., which had &quot;a flurry&quot; of new business in thefirst quarter.   Despite the strong business for most regional firms, manyconcede that the Wall Street giants could yet emerge aspowerful new competitors for regional business.   &quot;We lost a plain-vanilla private placement to a New Yorkhouse just four weeks ago,&quot; says one executive of aMidwestern regional firm, noting that the $10 milliontransaction couldn't have generated more than $60,000 in fees-- small potatoes for a big firm. &quot;They actually flew in fromNew York to this backwater city,&quot; he says. &quot;Since they aren'tdoing the big deals, they've got to do something.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
