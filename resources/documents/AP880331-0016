Speaking on the seventh anniversary of the shooting of PresidentReagan outside a Washington hotel, Coretta Scott King cited thesignificantly lower murder statistics from countries that controlhandgun sales.   Such restrictions, she said, ``are more effective than capitalpunishment'' in deterring killings. ``We need to end the needlesssacrifices of men, women and children on the altar of congressionalinaction.''   She later added: ``Congress has acquiesced to the gun lobby. Theonly thing that will bring an end to this inaction is an arousedcitizenry.''   Mrs. King then signed a giant-size petition, sponsored by theNational Coalition to Ban Handguns, that calls for restrictions onthe sale of handguns. She will be honorary chairwoman of thepetition drive along with Ethel Kennedy, the widow of Sen. RobertF. Kennedy.   The petition drive, called ``A Time to Remember, A Time to EndHandgun Violence,'' coincides with the 20th anniversary of thedeaths of King and Kennedy. King was assassinated on April 4, 1968,and Kennedy on June 6, 1968.   In a separate statement, Sarah Brady, wife of White House PressSecretary James Brady, who was wounded in the attack seven yearsago on Reagan, pleaded to Congress for stronger handgun controllaws.   Mrs. Brady said she supports legislation that would require aseven-day waiting period for handgun purchases to allow police toconduct a background check.   ``I'm firmly convinced that had such a proposal been in effectseven years ago, John Hinckley would have been prevented frompurchasing the handgun he used to shoot the president, my husbandand two law enforcement officers,'' Mrs. Brady said.   The National Coalition to Ban Handguns petition does not endorseany specific piece of legislation. But Michael K. Beard of thecoalition said ``we hope it will stimulate this Congress to enact anational waiting period requirement before a handgun may bepurchased, to ban the sale of non-detectable (plastic) handguns andto ban Saturday Night Specials, the kind of handgun used to killRobert Kennedy.''</TEXT></DOC>
