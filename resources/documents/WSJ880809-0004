Institutional Investor magazine called him one of the &quot;Heroes of October.&quot;    Mr. Wang's crash coup helped Beacon, an investment unit of Bank of New York, exceed the Standard andamp; Poor's 500 index for 1987 by a wide margin. The total return for his accounts was about ten percentage points greater than the 5.2% return of the Sandamp;P index.    Beacon has attempted to parlay Mr. Wang's October heroics into new business in a series of brochures claiming that his five-year results handily outdid the Sandamp;P. But some actual results show a different picture. The only three Beacon accounts whose performance can be verified have lagged behind the Sandamp;P and fallen far below the claimed returns.    The difference in results is significant. The higher advertised five-year returns put Beacon among the top 6% of all stock managers, according to SEI Corp., a pension-fund consultant. The lower results of the known accounts would put Beacon back in the pack of money managers who haven't matched the Sandamp;P.    The situation points up a big difficulty any investor faces in evaluating performance claims. Methods vary widely, and there is no one standard for such calculations. Some managers improve their results simply by not counting accounts of former clients.    Recent flyers for Beacon have promoted a five-year record in which its &quot;composite equity portfolio&quot; delivered an annual return of 18.8%, more than two percentage points better than the Sandamp;P's 16.4%. Both figures are for the five years ended Dec. 31, 1987, and include dividends.    Beacon has about $800 million under management, with about 55% of that in equity accounts, according to Money Market Directories Inc. in Charlottesville, Va. Among its 25 clients are Melville Corp., the Mellon Foundation, and the profit-sharing account of Dow Jones, which publishes this newspaper. Many of the larger clients didn't respond to requests for information about Beacon's performance.    One client, the Children's Aid Society, believes Mr. Wang has delivered an annual return of between 15% and 18% on its account. &quot;We're very pleased with him,&quot; says Philip Coltoff, the society's executive director. He hasn't verified the numbers exactly, but believes the total is closer to 18%.    But Beacon has lagged behind the Sandamp;P by a percentage point or more annually in three other accounts for which actual results can be determined.    Beacon's Multiple Employee Benefit Trust I, its main pooled stock fund for smaller clients, had a total return of 15.3% annually for the five years through 1987, according to CDA Investment Technologies Inc. of Silver Spring, Md. That fund, which had $56 million at the end of 1987, lagged behind the Sandamp;P in each of the four years 1983 through 1986.    CDA, which compiles results of funds as reported by money managers, says Beacon had a smaller stock fund with assets of $5 million with annual returns of 10.2% for the five years through 1987.    Another client for which Beacon manages roughly $50 million says Beacon has also lagged behind the market over the past five calendar years. This client, which asked to remain unidentified, says Beacon's annual return has been only 13.8%.    In response to questions for this article, Beacon amended its results slightly. It raised its claimed return for 1987 to 17.5% from 16.7%, but lowered its three-year annual return to 21.5% from 23.5% and reduced its five-year rate to 18.1% from 18.8%. Why? All a spokesman for Bank of New York would say is that Beacon's results are &quot;periodically recalculated.&quot;    Why did some accounts do worse than the advertised results? Mr. Wang says employees making contributions and withdrawals hurt some clients. Before 1986, he adds, the composite was based on &quot;samples of accounts.&quot; Also, the composite omits stocks with small market capitalization: The $5 million fund with 10.2% returns was a small-stock fund.    Mr. Wang also says that an employee who once calculated performance left the firm, that a new employee had the brochures distributed without his knowledge, and that Beacon has had three computer-system changes. As a result, he says, &quot;These things can get fouled up a little bit.&quot;    Mr. Wang is a market-timer, meaning he sometimes parks his stock funds in cash to avoid a downturn. That skill served him well last fall, but held him back in 1983 and 1985 when the bull market was bounding upward. It also has held him back this year: With stocks up 10% in price alone, cash-heavy Beacon is lagging again.    ---                    Some Actual Results Fall                    Short of Beacon's Claims                              ACTUAL                            RETURNS ON               BEACON'S      BEACON'S             ADVERTISED     MAIN POOLED     RETURNS               RETURNS        ACCOUNT*     ON Sandamp;P 500    1987       16.7%           15.7%          5.2%    Three    years    1985-87    23.5%           19.7%         18.0%    Five    years    1983-87    18.8%           15.3%         16.4%   Note: All figures are annual percentage rates counting dividends.   *Multiple Employee Benefit Trust Fund I   Source for Pooled Account and Sandamp;P: CDA Investment Technologies Inc., Rockville, Md.</TEXT></DOC>
