The draft bill escalates a Democratic argument that Bush hasbeen too timid in aiding the emerging democracies and establishinga foothold for U.S. companies in their newly free economies.   The bill by Sens. Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., and Joseph R. Biden,D-Del., includes a $1.2 billion U.S. share in a European Bank forReconstruction and Development, proposed by France to financepublic works and new private enterprises in former communisteconomies.   A copy of the draft was obtained Wednesday by The AssociatedPress.   The administration has conditioned U.S. participation in thebank on it refusal to lend for government projects or privateventures in the Soviet Union.   But Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady and other administrationofficials acknowledge that the bank, with commitments already frommost Western European countries and Japan, is going forward with orwithout a U.S. role.   ``Our economic competitors are racing to establish strongfootings in Eastern Europe,'' Biden said Wednesday. ``We took astutter step in the wrong direction when (the bank) was being setup and we lost our influence.''   House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., said theadministration's actions threaten to lock U.S. companies out ofbillions of dollars in new exports and technical aid that the bankwill be financing.   ``It's a brand new world and unless we throw off old ways ofthinking rooted in Cold War mentality, we risk being left behind,''Gephardt told a House Foreign Affairs subcommittee Wednesday.   The new bill by Pell, chairman of the Senate Foreign RelationsCommittee, and Biden, who chairs the panel's subcommittee oninternational economics and trade, is four times the $511 millionin new aid they proposed just two months ago.   The administration has proposed $300 million in new aid infiscal 1991 for Eastern Europe beyond the $738 million thatCongress set aside last year for helping Poland and Hungary through1992.   Administration officials have said any more money could not beabsorbed by the Eastern European economies without being wasted.   ``Businesses are waiting for the government to go first andcover risks in the region and the government is waiting forbusiness leaders to go in on their own,'' Biden complained. ``Whatwe're lacking is the vision to develop programs that transform ourmilitary presence in Europe to a political and economic presence.''   The bill would give the administration flexibility in dividingthe aid among Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Romania, Bulgaria andYugoslavia in addition to Poland and Hungary.   It would expand total aid to the seven countries to $2.75billion by the end of 1992 but does not say where the money wouldbe found. Except for some food programs, the measure does notspecify how much is to go to each country.   On Tuesday, Sens. Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., and Patrick J. Leahy,D-Vermont, proposed shifting some of the $800 million in newforeign aid that Bush wants for Nicaragua and Panama to EasternEurope.   While providing no direct aid to the Soviet government, the billauthorizes Bush to extend aspects of the program to the SovietUnion if they promote U.S. values there.   For example, it would authorize the AFL-CIO, using $40 millionin increased funds for the National Endowment for Democracy, tohelp foster effective trade unions in the Soviet Union, as it didwith the Solidarity movement in Poland.   Portions of a $44 million boost in Peace Corps spending in theregion also could be used for teaching English to Soviet citizens.   ``This is a penetration program, not an aid program,'' Bidensaid. ``The goal is to penetrate the Soviet Union with Americanvalues.''   Included is $200 million to create U.S. business centers in theseven East European countries to give technical and other aid forhelping American companies establish a foothold in their markets.</TEXT></DOC>
