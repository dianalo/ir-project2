Mr. Griffin's Griffin Co. said the Gaming Board for the Commonwealth of the Bahamas gave its clearance for the acquisition. Resorts operates in the Bahamas as well as in New Jersey.    Meanwhile, the New Jersey Casino Control Commission again cleared the transaction now that Mr. Griffin has secured financing. Although the New Jersey commission had given its clearance last month, a second vote was taken yesterday after the interest rates on $325 million in notes being issued to finance the acquisition were higher than previously expected.    The note offerings, underwritten by Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., are expected to close next Wednesday.    As previously reported, Mr. Griffin has agreed to pay $205 million for Resorts' Class A shares and an additional $96 million to New York developer Donald Trump for his supervoting Class B shares.    Mr. Trump, the chairman of Resorts, also would receive $63 million to terminate a management contract he has with the company. Mr. Trump then will buy back Resorts' uncompleted Taj Mahal hotel-casino project on Atlantic City's Boardwalk. </TEXT></DOC>
