Mrs. Marcos, 60, former first lady of the Philippines, begansobbing when defense lawyer Gerry Spence cross-examined FBI agentJames Trimbach on his testimony about the Marcoses' using allegedlystolen money for their own ends.   Spence, apparently referring to the Marcoses' daughter Imee,asked whether there was ``anything wrong with paying for yourchildren's education?''   Mrs. Marcos began to sob, and friends said later that she wasupset by the allusion to her older daughter, whom she has not seenin four years. Imee lives in Morocco and is not allowed to travelon a Philippine passport, they said.   After the judge declared a recess, she was taken to a nurse'sstation.   Aides to Mrs. Marcos quoted her physician, Dr. Rafael Zagala, assaying her blood pressure had jumped.   She later left the courthouse, quietly crying, on the arm of amarshal and climbed into her black van to return to her midtownapartment. Spence said he hoped Mrs. Marcos could return to courton Wednesday.   Earlier, prosecutors used a giant flow chart and Trimbach toexplain how Mrs. Marcos and her late husband allegedly used stolenmoney to secretly buy a New York office building.   They said that through money transfers involving 14 banks in NewYork, California, the Bahamas and the Philippines, the Marcosespaid $51 million for the Crown Building, a gilded tower acrossFifth Avenue from Tiffany's.   It was the first of four buildings the prosecution says werebought by the Marcoses with some of the $220 million allegedlyplundered from their country's treasury during former PresidentFerdinand Marcos' 20 years in power.   Mrs. Marcos is on trial in federal court for fraud andembezzlement, along with Saudi Arabian financier Adnan Khashoggi,who is accused of helping the Marcoses conceal their purchases.Marcos died in exile in Hawaii in September.   Assistant U.S. Attorney Debra Livingston used the board coveredwith boxes and arrows to show jurors how money moved from accountsheld by the Marcoses and their allies to other accounts andeventually to the Crown purchase.   Many witnesses, including several former bank officials, havetestified that Marcos used Philippine banks and government-ownedcompanies controlled by cronies to launder and conceal moneyallegedly drained from the country's dollar reserves or skimmedfrom government contracts.   The chart purported to show that in September 1981, funds heldin five different banks were channeled through intermediateaccounts in six separate transactions, and eventually to the CrownBuilding purchase.   Most of the money, including $30 million from the Traders RoyalBank of Manila, converged in a $43,128,239.25 deposit to the NewYork branch of Banque Paribas of Geneva.   Prosecutors say that the Banque Paribas account was managed byStephane Cattuai, whom they have described as the Marcoses'personal Swiss banker, and that the money represented the bulk ofthe payment for the Crown Building.   Among the banks listed on the chart was the California OverseasBank, which on Monday was ordered by Judge John F. Keenan to beturned over to the Philippine government as part of a plea bargainby its former owner, Robert S. Benedicto.   Benedicto, a Marcos friend, originally was indicted as aco-conspirator but fled to Spain and then Venezuela. He gave upownership of the bank and pleaded guilty to wire fraud in exchangefor being dropped from the case.   His lawyer, Wayne W. Smith, said the bank was worth between $20million and $30 million.   In a related development, the Los Angeles Times said theMarcoses doled out about $8.5 million to politicians, reporters andothers in the final days of Marcos' regime in a desperate bid toretain power.   The ledger was among documents found at Malacanang Palace afterMarcos fled a popular revolt on Feb. 25, 1986, and Corazon Aquino,who had defeated Marcos in an election days earlier, was installedas president.   It showed that Mrs. Marcos gave watches and envelopes of cash tomembers of the national press corps during the campaign, and thatas votes were being counted she handed out money gifts at a dinnerfor members of a government agency assigned to investigate electionfraud.</TEXT></DOC>
