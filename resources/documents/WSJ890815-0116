The Palo Alto, Calif., maker of computers and scientific instruments estimated that per-share net income for the third quarter ended July 31 was 11% to 16% less than what most analysts had anticipated.    The company expects to report Thursday that per-share net was, at best, flat at 75 cents to 80 cents, compared with analysts' expectations of as much as 95 cents. A year earlier, net was $192 million, or 80 cents a share, on revenue of $2.4 billion.    The company said both domestic and international orders for its products continue to show &quot;good&quot; year-to-year growth. But it said &quot;revenues will fall below expectations because of continuing difficulties in adjusting shipment plans to match the changing mix of its business.&quot;    The announcement, which drove Hewlett-Packard's stock down nearly 5% on heavy volume, was generally a less-shocking replay of glitches in the second-quarter. The company refused to elaborate on its difficulties, but said it had imposed expense and hiring controls as a means of improving its profitability.    Computer makers generally have had trouble attempting to forecast demand for their products. As the time it takes to bring a new product to market is shortening, computer makers are increasingly buffeted by their own inability to quickly manufacture new products, or by customer fears that the introduction of a better, cheaper machine is just around the corner.    The challenge has been compounded because Hewlett-Packard and many other companies have been maintaining ever-leaner product inventories in an attempt to hold down costs. Such policies have tended to make quarterly earnings reports more volatile, however.    Analysts speculated that, as in the second quarter, Hewlett-Packard had unexpected demand for such &quot;low-end&quot; products as personal computers, printers and workstations, while orders for its commercial computers and instruments failed to meet forecasts. While some analysts said the miscue didn't alter their fundamental view of the company, it has raised eyebrows.    &quot;After two quarters it becomes kind of a question mark&quot; as to why Hewlett can't ship more on the low-end, said Laura Conigliaro, an analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. &quot;These are products that basically use standard parts.&quot;    A spokeswoman said the lower-than-expected earnings was unrelated to the company's $476.4 million purchase in May of Apollo Computer Inc., a major manufacturer of workstations, which are desk-top computers widely used by scientists and engineers. The company previously said costs from the acquisition would depress per-share earnings 10 cents to 15 cents in the latest period.    While Hewlett-Packard's workstation business appears strong for the moment, there is some concern that the company has underestimated the challenge of taking over Apollo. Some analysts said the company has confused customers by not making it clear which computers it will continue to offer in the future. &quot;There's tremendous overlap&quot; between the two companies' workstation products, said Vicki Brown, an analyst with International Data Corp. of Framingham, Mass. &quot;I think they underestimated the amount of work it will take&quot; to make this acquisition successful.    In this year's second quarter, profit was $203 million, or 86 cents a share, on revenue of $2.86 billion. That profit was 21% below what some analysts had predicted.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Hewlett-Packard stock fell $2.50 to close yesterday at $52.75 a share.    Separately, Hewlett-Packard, Siemens AG and American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co.'s Microelectronics unit announced an agreement for international multisourcing of key fiber-optic parts. The companies said they agreed on a common transceiver with interchangeable parts that will comply with Fiber Distributed Data Interface standards for computer networking. The transceivers provide transmission of optical signals over fiber.    The companies said their pact will assure original equipment manufacturers of reliable sources of standardized products, and advance the development of an emerging industry standard for fiber-optic parts. Samples of the three companies' transceivers are slated to become available this fall. </TEXT></DOC>
