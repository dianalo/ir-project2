The technique involved sending sealed envelopes to top Drexel clients, with confidential details of prospective tender offers. Drexel asked the clients if they would help finance the planned bids, but warned recipients that they shouldn't trade on the information if they opened the envelopes. Drexel's chief executive officer, Fred Joseph, disclosed the practice last week at the Securities Industry Association's annual conference in Boca Raton, Fla.    Institutional investors, who learned of the tender offers only when the bids were announced, are troubled that someone else might have had foreknowledge. &quot;I don't like it,&quot; said Dean LeBaron, head of Batterymarch Financial Management Corp.    The sealed-envelope technique &quot;sounds like a bad idea to me,&quot; added James Martin, head of the College Retirement Equities Fund. &quot;If you put a temptation to trade in front of some people, they will succumb to it.&quot;    Drexel maintains that it took adequate safeguards to avoid leaks. The sealed envelopes were accompanied with letters warning that under federal securities laws, &quot;you are obligated not to trade in securities of the subject company while you are in possession of material non-public information about the tender offer described within.&quot;    Drexel spokesmen and lawyers cited three instances in which this sealed-envelope approach was used. The first was in early 1984, when Mesa Petroleum Co. proposed a tender offer for part of Gulf Oil Corp. The second was on June 4, 1984, when Drexel sent documents regarding a Reliance Group Holdings Inc. plan to bid for Walt Disney Productions. The other instance occurred Feb. 25, 1985, when Coastal Corp. was preparing an offer for American Natural Resources Co.    Drexel officials said they have stopped using the sealed-envelope approach, in part because of concern about leaks. &quot;We found the stock (price) started to rise&quot; before tender offers were announced, Mr. Joseph said last week. In addition, as Drexel's financing prowess has grown, it has been able to make multibillion-dollar funding commitments without having to sound out potential buyers of debt securities beforehand.    Any leaks &quot;would have been totally against Drexel's self-interest,&quot; said Leon Black, the firm's co-head of mergers and acquisitions. &quot;Even independent of all the ethical and legal questions, the last thing we would want is for the target company's stock to take off before the bid. That would make the deal harder to finance,&quot; he said.    Still, securities industry professionals worry that Drexel's approach may have been less than air-tight. In takeover situations, &quot;you can make appropriate disclosures to prospective financiers, but only if there's a reasonable belief that these disclosures won't be abused,&quot; said Roger D. Blanc, a partner in the law firm of Willkie, Farr andamp; Gallagher.    Mr. Blanc said the risk of leaks in such situations generally can be reduced if only a few potential financiers know of the pending bid, if they know only a day or two before it is announced, and if they are required to sign a pledge that they won't misuse the information.    In Washington, Gary Lynch, head of enforcement at the Securities and Exchange Commission, declined to comment on Drexel's sealed-envelope practices.    Documents provided by Drexel's attorneys show that the firm kept trying to refine its covering letters to financiers to reduce the risk of leaks. In a 1985 letter, Drexel omitted all references to the size of its planned offer; a comparable 1984 letter spelled out how much money Drexel was trying to raise.    Even so, sending such documents to prospective financiers &quot;was unwieldy,&quot; acknowledges Drexel's Mr. Black. He notes that Drexel hasn't used this approach since Coastal's March 4, 1985, bid for American Natural. Mr. Joseph said Thursday that Drexel later changed its practice, using disguised data on target companies when soliciting financing.    Earlier this year, the SEC charged that Dennis B. Levine, while a Drexel investment banker, used inside information to trade on American Natural. Mr. Levine also is accused of tipping off Ivan F. Boesky, the New York arbitrager, to the pending bid for American Natural.    Trading records for American Natural show the stock traded at $46.50 Feb. 22, 1985, the last trading day before Drexel began seeking financing for Coastal's bid. On Feb. 27, American Natural's stock climbed to $49.75 a share, and on Feb. 28, this newspaper's Heard on the Street column reported rumors that Drexel was raising financing for a takeover bid by Coastal. On March 4, Coastal began its $60-a-share bid for American Natural.    Asked if Drexel contacted the SEC about the premature rise in American Natural's stock price, Irwin Schneiderman, an attorney for Drexel, said, &quot;I suspect not.&quot; The trading activity was a matter of public record, said Mr. Schneiderman, a partner in the law firm of Cahill Gordon andamp; Reindel. At the time, Drexel didn't have clear evidence how any leaks might have occurred, he added. </TEXT></DOC>
