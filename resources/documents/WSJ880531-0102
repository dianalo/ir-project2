The auto maker's plan reflects a growing concern in German industry that high labor and material costs, coupled with stiff corporate tax rates, are hampering competitiveness in foreign and domestic markets. Many major German manufacturers, including Volkswagen, have shifted output abroad in recent years to cut costs.    Volkswagen said the plan was presented to the company's labor representatives to serve as a basis for future negotiations and doesn't call for any outright layoffs at its six German plants. The austerity measures include limitations on wages and hiring, a gradual reduction in the work force through attrition and more automated production. Reductions in vacation and Christmas bonuses, as well as certain other benefits, also were proposed.    &quot;It's no secret, and Carl Hahn (Volkswagen's chairman) has said this on several occasions, that our costs are too high in international comparison,&quot; a Volkswagen spokesman said, confirming a report in the news magazine Der Spiegel about the plan.    Volkswagen's union hasn't responded to the proposals yet, the company said. But the plan is likely to run into strong resistance from the IG Metall metalworkers union, which represents German auto workers and is the nation's biggest and most militant labor union. An IG Metall spokesman said over the weekend that the union will prevent Volkswagen &quot;from solving their problems at the expense of the workers.&quot;    The company's weekend announcement pushed up Volkswagen on Frankfurt's stock exchange yesterday. The company's shares rose 6.8 marks ($3.94), to 250.30 marks.    Volkswagen's labor costs amounted to about half its overall material costs of 31.3 billion marks ($18.2 billion) last year. Volkswagen built about 2.8 million cars last year, for a leading 14.9% share of Europe's auto market. </TEXT></DOC>
