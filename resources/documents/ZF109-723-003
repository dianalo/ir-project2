 In some cases, it's because ofspeed.andP;  In others, the reasons vary, but it's usually because of radiofrequency and electromagnetic interference.andP;  But recently, I had to pause andwonder if fiber is practical for all applications, and weigh theramifications of using fiber for more mundane applications.andM;This revelation occurred when I was verifying the cable plant for a networkthat was being installed to solve the needs of a process-control environment.andO;I'm used to configuring fiber to defeat the problem of electrical noiseassociated with heavy equipment and motors.andP;  And I'm familiar with the natureof many process environments: They're distributed between various buildingswith potential ground differencesandgt; fiber is a logical choice.andM;When industrial networks are involved, I am normally very hesitant to haveonly one data access path, having seen cables torn asunder whenever the whimsuits nearby equipment or construction crews, and given the chance ofaccidental explosions.andP;  Not to mention the host of other problems common tothe industrial environment.andP;  This network was no different.andP;  A redundantcable path made infinite sense to ensure that the control stations could dowhat control stations do--control the operation.andM;I kept thinking there was another reason for a redundant fiber path, and thenit hit me: fiber splicing.andM;When a coaxial cable &quot;bites the big one,&quot; it isn't a biggie to fix thesituation.andP;  Cut out the offending section of cable with cable cutters, stripthe cable back properly with cable strippers, attach some ferrules, crimp theferrules, put on some connectors, crimp the connectors, and seat and crimpthe outside ferrules to the connector.andP;  Do the same to the other cablesegment, attach a barrel connector in the middle and voila]  Patched cablesegment.andM;Time to fix?andP;  About 20 minutes for anyone marginally skilled in suchactivities.andP;  I've seen it done completely from start to finish in less thanfive minutes by someone who can do cable faster than I thought possible.andM;Twisted-pair is even easier.andP;  Crimping and stripping tools are more readilyavailable and fast to use.andP;  One tool can strip, cut the excess and crimp allthe connectors onto the twisted-pair in two operations at mostandgt; a new toolcan do it in one.andM;SPLICING IS A PAINandM;Splicing fiber is not at all like splicing coaxial cable, twisted-pair or anyother copper cable.andP;  To splice or terminate fiber properly involves carefulscoring under a magnifying glass or microscope, cutting, polishing the endwith a fiber-polishing machine, inspecting the polished end, and performingfusion splicing to an equivalently prepared end of another fiber or gluing itto a connector for attachment to a device.andM;This might seem simple, but it isn't.andP;  I had to go to school for six days tolearn how to do it (different fibers, different techniques), and then spendabout $50,000 on polishing, inspecting and testing hardware.andM;Once the fiber is spliced, a spectrum analysis is necessary to measure signalloss and to ascertain that the signal is adequate for data transmission.andO;This involves the use of a spectrum analysis system and a fiber-optictime-domain reflectometer.andM;Done correctly, it takes about 20 to 40 minutes per fiber end.andP;  Because atypical fiber splice involves a minimum of two fibers per path (four fiberends to be cut and polished), it takes anywhere from an hour and a half tothree hours after the backhoe has come and gone to get everything back tonormal for one pair of fibers.andP;  It costs $100 to $240 per fiber to have aspecialist splice them together--he or she has to pay for that equipmentsomehow.andP;  In short, fiber splicing is a pain in the right posterior cheek.andM;Which leads back to my fibrous dilemma.andP;  The main cable path to the maincontrol center from the outlying buildings was up the middle of a grassyknoll constantly traversed by trenching and dirt-moving tools.andP;  The originalplan for the process-control network was to run all the cables down a commonwire path.andP;  Thus, the chances of the various 24-pair fiber bundles beingdisturbed in their subterranean repose were much better than average.andM;With 24 pairs of fiber to reconnect after such an event, reconnecting thefiber paths--even if everything went correctly--would take more than 75hours, and that would be working straight through to completion.andP;  Figure theodds on that.andM;Even to get an emergency connection up and running, at least wo fibers (fourends) would have to be spliced to provide continuity for one fiber path.andP;  Thenetwork would be down for one to two hours, and that's if a repair team wason site.andP;  If one had to be fetched from afar, the delay would be another twoto four hours.andP;  If any problems arose, the delay would increase even more.andM;What we finally did was to run a dual, redundant cable path down separatephysical paths, thereby reducing the possibility of physical cabledisruption.andM;What it all comes down to is that fiber offers a great many attractiveoptions such as noise immunity and very high speed, but there is the darkside of repair that should give you cause for concern.andM;HOPE ON THE HORIZONandM;Fortunately, this condition won't necessarily last forever.andP;  As plastic fiberstarts to make the scene over the next few years, we'll see more and moreimplementations in communications networks.andP;  Plastic fiber is not spliced atall like glass fiber.andP;  A very sharp cutting device is used, and no polishingis necessary.andP;  By using reflective ceramic connections, the splicing ofplastic fiber takes only a few minutes as opposed to the hours of oppressionthat splicing glass fiber takes.andM;Glass-fiber tapping devices are also starting to appear.andP;  Recently, anon-intrusive fiber tap was demonstrated as a possible tool to allow quickerand more reliable connectivity to fiber-optic networks.andP;  Splicing tools arealso being developed.andM;For the near term--a year or two or so--the penalties of fiber splicing arehere to stay.andP;  Be wary of where you use fiber and how it is run, and rememberthat the time required to splice it is far from trivial.andM;Bill Hancock is a principal at Network-1, a New York-based companyspecializing in network security and counsulting.andP;  He is also a member of theDECUS board of directors.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
