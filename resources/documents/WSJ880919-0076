Winter (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> ETN </CO><IN> AUT PRO TNM MON </IN><DATELINE> CLEVELAND  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Four years ago, Eaton Corp. was looking for a new growth business and eagerly eyeing defense electronics firms. Fortunately, it's clear now, the targets were priced too high for Eaton's purse.    Today, Eaton is convinced it has discovered two growth businesses under its own roof: automotive parts, and electrical and electronic controls.    The story of how those mature cash cows regained the energy of frisky, fast-growing heifers illustrates a profound change in basic U.S. manufacturing and in the attitude of the executives directing it.    The fountain of youth for Eaton's mature businesses -- and the rejuvenating tonic for their masters -- has been the declining dollar. &quot;The dominant factor in today's world economy is the weaker U.S. dollar,&quot; James R. Stover, Eaton's chairman and chief executive officer, is fond of saying.    That's certainly the case at Eaton where the combination of resurgent markets and Eaton's revitalized core businesses is producing results. Analysts expect the company this year to earn about $6 a share from continuing operations (after giving effect to a 3-for-2 stock split paid today), up from $206.2 million, or a restated $4.89. Mr. Stover declines to be that specific, but he says it's realistic to expect a solid profit gain because business is strong at most of the company's major operations.    Future earnings growth seems likely as well. &quot;Eaton has a well-thought-out, long-term strategy,&quot; says David G. Sutliff, a vice president at Salomon Brothers Inc. who covers capital goods. &quot;Investment in its basic businesses is going to pay off well over a period of years.&quot;    Executives here and at many other manufacturers have only recently become confident about the future and shed a previous grim attitude about merely surviving. But the world's central bankers and currency speculators could shatter that optimism if they again drive the dollar sharply higher. A soaring dollar would wipe out the competitive edge of U.S. manufacturers, and probably spark a recession.    Eaton may be walking a dangerous line by putting so much faith in the lower dollar. Sean St. Clair, an analyst at Duff and Phelps Inc., Chicago, says that the dollar has risen about 5% to 6% from its low of two years ago. &quot;That move isn't significant enough&quot; to stem the current export boom &quot;but a 50% to 60% move up from here would cause problems,&quot; he says. Still, he adds, &quot;any dollar moves upward the rest of this year won't hit companies like Eaton until 1990, because of the long lag effect.&quot; Eaton and others didn't begin benefiting from the dollar's steep 1985 decline until last year, Mr. St. Clair adds.    Eaton executives are betting the company's future that the dollar won't take off again.    &quot;This is a secular change, not just a change in the business cycle,&quot; says Stephen R. Hardis, Eaton vice chairman and chief financial and administrative officer. He believes U.S. industrial output will rise faster than consumption over the next decade, reversing the trend of the early 1980s.    Aided by the current dollar-driven expansion of U.S. manufacturing, Eaton's sales of industrial switches and controls as well as truck transmissions, axles, brakes and engine parts have been climbing. Sales of truck parts especially surge when U.S. production is strong because every pound of domestically produced goods is trucked five to seven times, Mr. Stover says. In contrast, imported goods ride only once or twice.    Mr. Stover also says he no longer fears that European truck builders, who produce many of their own parts, will take an increasing share of the U.S. truck market.    Mirroring trends elsewhere in U.S. basic manufacturing, Eaton also is benefiting from changes in the way it makes its products and in its corporate culture. A visit to the company's 60-year-old Marshall, Mich., factory makes that clear. The plant, which makes truck differentials and auto clutches, is being outfitted with $23.5 million of computer-controlled lathes, robots and automated parts-delivery systems.    Eaton was one of the first domestic companies to recognize that the 1981-82 recession was more than a cyclical downturn. In 1982, it took a $181.4 million write-off to close plants, placed several ailing units on the block, and began streamlining the survivors. Directors also moved aggressively to conserve capital, chopping the quarterly dividend by more than half -- to 20 cents from 43 cents -- and reducing capital investment by one-third.    Last year, net income was $201.2 million, or a restated $4.77 a share, on sales of $3.14 billion. In contrast, in pre-recession 1981, Eaton earned $128 million, or a restated $3.14 a share, on sales of $2.70 billion. Last month, shareholders got tangible evidence of the fresh prosperity and confidence -- a 50% increase in the quarterly dividend to 75 cents a share. Today they'll receive one additional common share for each two previously held in a 3-for-2 split voted by the board in July. Eaton also has spent $800 million over the last three years to buy back shares.    Eaton now has replaced its strategy of making a huge acquisition of a new growth business with plans to make only medium-sized &quot;fill-in&quot; acquisitions to speed growth of existing operations. A good example is its July purchase of Cessna Fluid Power division from General Dynamics Corp. The unit, with annual sales of about $100 million, fills out Eaton's hydraulics products line and provides an entry into Europe's hydraulics business.    For Eaton, the renewed confidence in the basic businesses translates into higher capital spending, to more than $175 million projected this year from $151.1 million in 1987 and only $94.4 million three years ago. Another rise is slated for 1989, says Alfred M. Rankin Jr., vice chairman and chief operating officer.    Eaton is part of a trend here. Other heavy industrial and capital goods manufacturers, aware that they need to modernize and upgrade plants to stay competitive, also are increasing their spending budgets.    And what of the defense electronics business Eaton did nurture? The company has opted to leave that business. For one thing, executives figure it would take too steep an investment to make Eaton a significant player. Also, the company hasn't been all that successful in managing that business, as evidenced by the embarrassing troubles it's had producing radar-jamming equipment for the Air Force's B-1 bombers.    Gary McManus of Merrill Lynch, says, &quot;Eaton executives are much more comfortable in their traditional transmissions and electronic controls businesses than in high-tech defense systems.&quot;    Eaton has put its defense systems businesses on the block. It will however continue to upgrade the B-1 bomber radar system because it feels a commitment to that project, which is part of the defense triad. &quot;As long as we have it, it's critical that we do a good job,&quot; says a company spokesman. </TEXT></DOC>
