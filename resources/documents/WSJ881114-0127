A study by the Uranium Institute, a London-based international group that represents producers and consumers, predicts that the world's nuclear-power generating capacity will expand by a third to 347,000 megawatts by the year 2000 from 261,000 megawatts this year.    An official of the group says that estimate takes into account the slowdown in nuclear-plant construction around the world since the 1986 Chernobyl plant explosion in the Soviet Union heightened fears about the safety of nuclear power. Stig Sandklef, director of nuclear power at the Swedish State Power Board and chairman of the Uranium Institute's Supply and Demand Committee, says nuclear generating capacity still will grow, largely because of a lack of any feasible large-scale alternative. This inevitably will mean stronger demand for uranium, he said.    Spot prices of uranium have fallen to $14.15 a pound from $17 a year ago and a peak of $43 in 1978 because of huge world inventories and depressed oil prices.    However, as one sign that the downturn could be ending, the Soviet Union last month ordered a reactor from Siemens AG of West Germany and Asea Brown Boveri AG of Switzerland, its first since the Chernobyl accident.    Despite Chernobyl and despite anti-nuclear protests and concerns being expressed around the world, there isn't any realistic alternative to an expansion of nuclear power's role in the world energy supply, Mr. Sandklef said in a paper called &quot;Preparing for the 21st Century&quot; that he presented at a recent London conference.    The reason, he said, lies in the potential for a huge increase in electricity consumption world-wide.    More than four-fifths of all the electricity currently being generated is used by only a quarter of the world's population, he said, and hundreds of millions of homes around the world still don't have electricity.    Currently, Mr. Sandklef said, coal is the source of 37% of the world's electricity production, while hydroelectric power provides 23%, nuclear energy 17%, oil 12% and gas 10%.    However, the use of fossil fuels such as coal is encountering opposition from environmentalists and scientists concerned about the severe North American drought this year and unusual weather patterns elsewhere.    &quot;The greenhouse effect is receiving increasing attention as a real threat to our planet, and coal-burning is thought to be a major contributor to the growing levels of carbon dioxide,&quot; Mr. Sandklef said.    Other energy sources also are running into problems, according to Mr. Sandklef and uranium industry analysts: Most of the feasible sources of hydroelectric power are already being tapped, and oil and natural gas pose the risk of future shortages or supply disruptions that could cause prices to surge again as they did in the 1970s.    World uranium production, meanwhile, is expected to grow to 45,000 metric tons in 1995 from 37,000 tons this year, says George White, vice president of Nuexco Trading Corp., a Menlo Park, Calif., uranium brokerage concern.    But in the past three years, uranium output has fallen below the requirements of nuclear power plants, according to Sumio Horiuchi, deputy director of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development's Nuclear Energy Agency. This shortage is likely to continue unless higher prices encourage mines to extract more costly uranium resources, he said.    A possible beneficiary could be U.S. producers. Their share of world output has shrunk to 13% from around 50% in the early 1970s, said Mr. White of Nuexco.    &quot;U.S. uranium deposits are smaller, lower-grade and more costly to produce than those in Canada, Australia and Africa,&quot; he said. However, he said, if prices rise enough, the U.S. would be able to supply all its own needs by 1993. Mr. Horiuchi of the OECD projects that the U.S.'s recoverable reserves would be at least double their current level if contract prices -- which normally are higher than spot prices -- rose to $36 a pound or more.    Inventories have been falling for several years, and so the market could swiftly turn, says Phillip Crowson, head of the economics division at RTZ Corp., a London-based international mining group. Inventories are still &quot;excessive&quot; now, he says, but the rate at which demand is exceeding production indicates they will fall to normal levels in four to five years.    The market could then tighten quickly, he says, leading to an &quot;undignified scramble&quot; for uranium supplies.    Looking ahead to other commodity markets this week:   Copper   Is the long-awaited correction in the copper price rally finally taking place?    This week may tell. The December futures contract rose to a life-of-contract high of $1.4820 on Nov. 3 from 86 cents in August. By Friday, it had dropped as low as $1.3130 before recovering somewhat to close at $1.3510.    It seems as if the market is trying to fight its way downward despite an almost unrelieved bullish supply-demand picture that should continue to propel prices higher.    Most striking is that the decline has come when the most dominant news development, the month-long Peruvian national strike, is at its worst. Peru is the world's sixth largest copper producer.    &quot;If you're a technician, you blame it on the charts, and if you're a fundamentalist you attribute it to recent developments, which some feel may indicate a possible ending of the strike,&quot; an analyst said.    Among these was a reported settlement last week with one union that later proved to represent white collar workers, not miners. On Friday, there was a report that workers at one mine had been offered a 75% raise in wages and improved benefits. This was seen as an attempt to crack the united labor front that wants a national settlement and not a mine-by-mine series of agreements.    Also, the Peruvian government reportedly canceled an austerity decree that limited wage increases and benefits following a court ruling that it violated workers' collective bargaining rights.    Grains and Soybeans   With the presidential elections over, traders will watch for signs this week the Soviet Union will re-emerge as a big buyer of U.S. corn. Its disappearance last week helped push prices lower. &quot;Because of their absence the corn market just keeps getting cheaper and cheaper,&quot; said Frank Beurskens, president of Advance Trading Inc. in Bloomington, Ill. Analysts estimate the Soviets will purchase eight to 10 million metric tons of subsidized corn in the year ending next Sept. 30. It's estimated that the Soviet Union has already bought about 4.5 million metric tons. </TEXT></DOC>
