In 1977, they collected cores onsmall, steep-sided hillocks and planted tuliptree seedlings in thesecores. Seedlings grown in black locust soils were taller, with heavierleaves, stems and root systems than those in other minesoils, while seedlingsgrown in white pine soils were smaller and lighter than all the others.Effect of slope position depended on parent material; on the acid minesoil,seedlings grown in soil from the lower slope position were taller, withheavier leaves and root systems, but on the calcareous minesoil, slopeposition had the opposite effect. The acid minesoil produced larger,heavier seedlings than the calcareous one. Black locust soils producedseedlings with leaf blades higher in N and P and lower in Mg than thosedeveloped under the other 3 species. Leaf blades of seedlings grown inwhite pine soils were lowest in P and K. Seedlings grown in acid minesoilhad higher concentrations of N, P, K, Mg, and Mn, and lower concentrationsof Ca in their leaf blades than those grown in calcareous minesoil. Possiblereasons for these differences include more favorable physical propertiesin the acid minesoil or micronutrient deficiencies in the calcareousminesoil.</TEXT></DOC>
