The assessment providesa basis for the conclusion that the field testing of these geneticallyengineered alfalfa plants will not present a risk of introduction or disseminationof a plant pest and will not have any significant impact on the qualifyof the human environment.

A permit must be obtained before a regulated article can beintroduced in the United States. The regulations set forth procedures forobtaining a limited permit for the importation or interstate movement ofa regulated article and for obtaining a permit for the release into theenvironment of a regulated article. The Animal and Plant Health InspectionService (APHIS) has stated that it would prepare an environmental assessmentand, when necessary, an environmental impact statement before issuing apermit for the release into the environment of a regulated article (see52 FR 22906).The Northrup King Company, of Stanton, Minnesota, has submitted an applicationfor a permit for release into the environment, to field test alfalfa plantsgenetically engineered to express a gene which provides resistance to theglufosinate-class of herbicides. The field trial will take place in Woodland,California.In the course of reviewing the permit application, APHIS assessed the impacton the environment of releasing the alfalfa plant under the conditionsdescribed in the Northrup King Company application. APHIS concluded thatthe field testing will not present a risk of plant pest introduction ordissemination and will not have any significant impact on the quality ofthe human environment.The environmental assessment and finding of no significant impact, whichare based on data submitted by the Northrup King Company, as well as areview of other relevant literature, provide the public with documentationof APHIS' review and analysis of the environmental impacts associated withconducting the field testing.The facts supporting APHIS' finding of no significant impact are summarizedbelow and are contained in the environmental assessment.1. A gene from <T3>Streptomyces viridochromogenes</T3> has been inserted into an alfalfachromosome. The expression of this gene provides resistance to the glufosinate-classof herbicides. In nature, genetic material contained in a chromosome isgenerally transferred to another sexually compatible plant by cross-pollination.In this field trial, no introduced gene can spread to another plant bycross-pollination, because the genetically engineered alfalfa plants willbe mowed to prevent flower formation. Thus, no pollen will be producedby any alfalfa plant in this experiment.2. Neither the glufosinate acetyl transferase gene itself, nor its geneproduct confers on alfalfa any plant pest characteristic.3. The bacterium <T3>Streptomyces viridochromogenes,</T3> from which the glufosinate acetyltransferase gene was isolated, is not a plant pest. 4. The vector used to transfer the glufosinate acetyl transferase geneto alfalfa plant cells has been evaluated for its use in this specificexperiment and does not pose a plant pest risk in this experiment. Thevector, although derived from the DNA of a tumor inducing (Ti) plasmidwith known plant pathogenic potential, has been disarmed; that is, genesthat are necessary for pathogenicity have been removed from the vector.The vector has been tested and shown to be not pathogenic to any susceptibleplant.5. The vector agent <T3>Agrobacterium tumefaciens,</T3> a phytopathogenic bacterium, was usedto deliver the vector DNA and the glufosinate acetyl transferase gene intoalfalfa plant cells. The vector agent has been chemotherapeutically eliminatedand shown to be no longer associated with any regenerated alfalfa plant.6. Horizontal movement or gene transfer of the glufosinate acetyl transferasegene is not possible. The vector acts by delivering and inserting the geneinto an alfalfa chromosome (i.e., chromosomal DNA). No mechanism for horizontalmovement is known to exist in nature to move an inserted gene from a chromosomeof a tranformed plant to any other organism.7. The size of the field test plot is small and will be located on a privateresearch farm in a rural area which will provide good security.The environmental assessment and finding of no significant impact havebeen prepared in accordance with: (1) The National Environment Policy Actof 1969 (NEPA) (42 U.S.C. 4331 <T3>et seq.</T3>), (2) Regulations of the Council on Environmental Qualityfor Implementing the Procedural Provisions of NEPA (40 CFR Parts 1500-1509),(3) USDA Regulations Implementing NEPA (7 CFR Part 1b), and (4) APHIS GuidelinesImplementing NEPA (44 FR 50381-50384, August 28, 1979, and 44 FR 51272-51274,August 31, 1979).<ITAG tagnum="21">Done in Washington, DC., this 19th day of July 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">James W.
