The Senate Judiciary Committee was back in session yesterday, beginning its inquiry into the nomination of Judge Anthony Kennedy to the Supreme Court. By and large, it was all sweetness and light, in marked contrast to the assault on Robert Bork. Indeed, some of what was said at the Bork hearings seems to have slipped down the memory hole.    Joe Biden quickly returned to one of the hot issues in the Bork hearing when he asked Judge Kennedy about his thoughts on the Ninth Amendment, which says, &quot;The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.&quot;    Judge Kennedy said, &quot;When Madison, who was the principal draftsman of the Bill of Rights, wrote the Bill of Rights, he wanted to be very sure that his colleagues, the voters, the world understood that he did not have the capacity to foresee every verbal formulation that was necessary for the protection of the individual. He was writing at a time when state constitutions were still being drafted, and he knew that some state constitutions went somewhat further than the Constitution of the United States -- the Virginia Bill of Rights. In my view, one of his principal purposes simply as a statesman was to give assurance that this was not a proclamation of every right that should be the right of the free people. . . .&quot;    Senator Biden responded, &quot;Judge, I happen to, I don't want to hurt your prospects any, but I happen to agree with you. I find comfort in your acknowledgment that it had a purpose. There are some who argue it has no purpose. Some have suggested that it was a 'waterblot' on the Constitution. I read it as you do.&quot;    So do others. We all know that Senator Biden has difficulty remembering who said what on which occasion, but the irony is that Judge Kennedy's comments on the Ninth Amendment were fundamentally the same as Robert Bork's. Judge Bork said the most likely meaning of the amendment was that &quot;the enumeration of these {rights} does not entitle judges to override the state constitutional rights.&quot; The &quot;blot&quot; was a reference to the objection by Judge Bork, which Judge Kennedy shares, to the radical notion of Laurence Tribe and others that the Ninth Amendment is an open invitation for justices to create new &quot;unenumerated&quot; rights that strike their fancy.    The civil treatment Judge Kennedy is receiving stands in stark contrast to the brass knuckles used against Judge Bork. The method of argument used to undermine the Bork nomination made even some of his opponents queasy, but the history of that spectacle is already undergoing revision. Joe Biden, Ted Kennedy and now Thurgood Marshall are saying that Judge Bork got a fair hearing. This requires them, as the Ninth Amendment exchange shows, to further besmirch Judge Bork even as they approve Judge Kennedy.    Judge Bork himself will no doubt have some things to say about this revisionism, judging by his speech earlier this month to the Law Club of Chicago, in which he said the campaign against him &quot;set record lows in mendacity, brutality and vulgarity.&quot; But the script for the Kennedy hearings is already clear. What is in fact going on here is that the Judiciary Committee majority and its supporters are now seeking sanction for destroying the Bork nomination. They will now approve Judge Kennedy, and declare themselves all honorable men.    We look forward to Justice Kennedy, but let no one misunderstand the politics of his hearing. Judge Bork's brave decision to stay the course and make the mob pay a price is why the Kennedy nomination is going so smoothly. </TEXT></DOC>
