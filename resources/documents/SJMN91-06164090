Executives are getting richer faster, and while some individuals canmake a good case for their astronomical compensation, overall thejustification isn't apparent.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Editorial  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  FAT CATS GET FATTERUNDULY HIGH EXECUTIVE PAY SAPS THE MORALEOF WORKERS AND MIDDLE MANAGERS  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Editorials  </MEMO><TEXT>     Business Week put it bluntly on the cover of its annual executive pay issue(May 6). From 1980 to 1990, average worker pay went up 58 percent; corporateprofits went up 78 percent; compensation for CEOs went up 212 percent.;   Last year, it was the same kind of story. Factory workers' pay increased 2.8percent; white-collar professionals, up 5.2 percent; inflation, up 6.1percent; CEOs' total compensation up 7 percent. And profits? Down 7 percent.;   In Silicon Valley, average executive pay was up 17 percent.;    It has notalways been this way. From 1960 to 1980, earnings of executives andblue-collar and white-collar workers increased roughly in the sameproportions.;    That all changed in the 1980s, when executive pay took off.In 1980, CEO compensation was 42 times the paycheck of the average worker. In1990, 85 times.;    You can measure the performance of U.S. businesses anynumber of ways, but no one cites the '80s as the decade in which the dynamicleadership of American corporations enabled them to clobber the internationalcompetition.;    Resentful workers aren't the only ones raising questionsabout executive pay. Management guru Peter Drucker suggests that a corporateexecutive ought to earn no more than 20 times the lowest-paid employee. Agreater difference, Drucker says, saps not only the morale of rank-and-fileworkers, but of middle managers as well.;    One way to put a brake on is togive shareholders more of a voice in determining executive pay, instead ofplacing it with the board of directors, often composed of other corporateexecutives.;    A bill introduced in the U.S. Senate by Carl Levin, D-Mich.,would change rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that allowcorporations to block stockholders from voting on pay.;    Corporateexecutives worried that U.S. businesses and the government aren't doing whatit takes to meet the international competition can start at the top. In Japan,a ratio between executive pay and worker pay of 17-to-1 is typical; inGermany, 23-1.  </TEXT><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910612  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Wednesday  </DAY><MONTH>  June  </MONTH><PG.COL>  6B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  409  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Wednesday June 12, 199100164090,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
