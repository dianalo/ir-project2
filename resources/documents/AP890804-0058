(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Rick Sargent didn't expect to see hiswallet or his credit cards again after they fell into Lake Genevaduring a recent trip to Switzerland, but a Swiss diver retrievedthem and mailed them home.   ``I think if someone lost their wallet in Lake Lanier, somebodywould probably take the money and just throw the wallet away,''said Sargent, band leader at Chamblee High School.   He was in Switzerland with the DeKalb College Jazz Band for theinternational Montreux Jazz Festival when his wallet, containing$169 and credit cards, slipped out of his pocket and into the lake.   He returned to Lawrenceville July 22 and last week received hiswallet and its contents in the mail with a letter from GeorgesDelacombaz of the Montreux Scuba Diving Club, who found them. Theletter said the diver plans to visit the United States andsuggested ``maybe we could meet somewhere for a beer.''   ``I was really amazed that, number one, somebody found mywallet, and that, number two, they'd go to that much trouble toreturn it,'' said Sargent.   Sargent said he will write Delacombaz and include a reward.</TEXT><NOTE>Eds: A version of following item moved on the financial wire.</NOTE><DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A bank dedicated to young customers is offeringwhat it says is the first-ever credit card for children.   Young Americans Bank introduced the new credit cards Thursday ata party marking the institution's second anniversary.   Like most credit cards, these have restrictions. Children musttalk a parent or other adult into co-signing and guaranteeingpayment on their accounts.   Although cardholders must be at least 12 years old and cannotexceed a $100 credit limit, the bank will consider increasingcredit limits and lowering age requirements for particularlycreditworthy children, said Leanne Cadman, who heads the bank'sloan department.   Otherwise, the MasterCards, issued by United Bank of Denver, arejust like the grown-up versions. Kids will receive a monthlystatement advising them of the balance and telling them the minimummonthly payment. Interest will accrue at the annual rate of 18.8percent, Cadman said.   Young Americans Bank, a state-chartered and federally insuredbank, already offers checking accounts for children 12 or older. Inits two years of service, it has signed up 10,000 depositors.</TEXT><DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   What to call a merger of Baltimore andWashington for statistical purposes:   _ Washimore? Could be confused with that monument in SouthDakota.   _ Baltiwash? Sounds like a new laundry detergent.   _ Balington? Washbal? These and other names are facetiouslybeing considered if the U.S. Census Bureau decides after the 1990census that the two cities' populations have grown close enough tocombine into one statistical entity.   ``It doesn't really change anything,'' Don Starsinic, chief ofthe population estimate office in the Census Bureau, said Friday.``It creates one large metropolitan area rather than two fairlylarge metropolitan areas.''   He added that the government could still provide statisticstailored to each population center if local officials desired.   The Washington area has more than 3.7 million people and theBaltimore area has 2.3 million people, ranking the two cities ninthand 17th, respectively, in the nation.   If combined, they would become the nation's fifth-largestmetropolitan area, Starsinic said.   Census officials said two areas are combined when the areasexpand so far as to meet each other, with at least 10 percent ofthe smaller city's workforce crossing the border each day to work.</TEXT></DOC>
