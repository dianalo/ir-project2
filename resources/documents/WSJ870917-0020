TaylorStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 09/17/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> FORGNENVIRONMENT (ENV)ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY (EPA)ENERGY DEPARTMENT (ERG) </IN><DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   The signing of a treaty to protect the Earth's ozone layer is spurring environmental policy makers in many countries to consider tackling a more difficult and more serious problem: the global warming caused by accumulation of carbon dioxide and other gases in the atmosphere.    William Long, head of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's international office, said some of his colleagues in other countries see the successful ozone talks as &quot;a sort of a model that could be used&quot; to deal with this so-called greenhouse effect.    Recent scientific evidence indicates that average temperatures are likely to rise more sharply than scientists had thought only a few years ago. A U.S. Energy Department official said his most recent studies forecast an average global warming of 5.76 to 8.64 degrees Fahrenheit within the next century. This could cause a rise of three feet or more in sea level, putting many coastal areas under water, as well as produce drastic changes in rainfall and crop production.    United Nations officials already have begun to harness to the &quot;greenhouse&quot; issue the same machinery that led to the ozone agreement signed yesterday in Montreal. They are focusing research on regional impacts, sponsoring conferences and beginning to explore options for policies to address the problem.    Yet despite optimism stemming from the ozone agreement, some officials here still say the difficulties of curbing the greenhouse effect are huge, maybe insuperable. For example, a sharp reduction in the use of coal would be required. Also, cooperation is complicated by the fact that some areas may benefit from the warming, and that accurately predicting effects on specific regions isn't yet possible.    The &quot;greenhouse&quot; term was coined to describe warming of the earth's atmosphere due to rising levels of carbon dioxide and four other gases that absorb low energy radiation. The gases are said to work like a greenhouse, holding heat inside the stratosphere.    Even the lower end of the predicted temperature rise would produce a warmer Earth than humans have ever witnessed. Jessica Matthews, an analyst for the World Resources Institute, says, &quot;Man has embarked on a vast, unplanned planetary experiment that poses unprecedented challenges to his wisdom, foresight and scientific capacity.&quot;    Since carbon dioxide is produced by burning fossil fuels, especially coal, only sharp changes in energy use can prevent warming. U.S. officials find this unlikely. The nuclear alternative is crippled in many nations by high costs and safety concerns. And the Third World is expected to increase emissions; in China, for instance, coal is likely to fuel a tripling of the economy by 2000.    The Reagan administration says not enough is known about the regional effects of warming to consider controls. Many U.S. officials predict nations instead will adapt to climatic change. For instance, they may withdraw people from low coastal areas.    But that may prove impossible in flood-prone Bangladesh or the Maldives, islands in the Indian Ocean with a maximum elevation of about six feet. And Ms. Matthews argues that warming eventually will become generally intolerable. The World Resources Institute's Irving Mintzer adds that carbon dioxide emissions can be trimmed by using energy more efficiently and burning more natural gas, which emits less carbon dioxide than coal. &quot;We don't have to go back to caves and candles,&quot; he says.    Peter Usher, atmospheric program officer at the United Nations Environmental Program, says he is &quot;enormously&quot; encouraged by the ozone talks. Over U.S. objections, the U.N. agency's governors have told him to present policy options in 1989 for international action to deal with global warming.    &quot;Maybe we're seeing a turn of events here in terms of people's awareness,&quot; says Craig Potter, head of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's air programs. &quot;We have a world economy,&quot; he adds. &quot;What we're beginning to talk about is the possibility of a global environmental ethic.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
