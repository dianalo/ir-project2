Taylor (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> GOVMT </CO><IN> BNK TNM </IN><TEXT>   Federal regulators liquidated two insolvent Southern California thrifts for a record $1.35 billion, but industry officials doubt the move will significantly lower the rates that savings and loans pay to attract deposits.    Federal Home Loan Bank Board Chairman M. Danny Wall said the unusual liquidations are part of &quot;our drive to remove from the marketplace those high-rate-paying insolvent thrifts that have been artificially driving up the cost of money for healthy thrifts.&quot;    However, analysts and economists said the two thrifts represented only a small fraction of the high-rate-deposit market, and they pointed out that their elimination probably wouldn't have any effect on rates paid for retail deposits, which represent 87% of the industry's total.    As expected, the Bank Board yesterday announced the liquidations of American Diversified Savings Bank and North America Savings andamp; Loan Association, both based in Costa Mesa, Calif. The Bank Board's Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. arm said it expects to pay out $1.14 billion in cash to insured depositors of American Diversified and $209 million to insured depositors of North America. About 0.5% of the institutions' deposits were uninsured, regulators said. The liquidations together were nearly five times larger than the previous record liquidation, of Empire Savings andamp; Loan Association, of Mesquite, Texas, for $300 million in 1984.    Both institutions had been operated for more than a year by managers selected by the Bank Board. American Diversified was declared insolvent in February 1986, and North America was declared insolvent in January 1987.    &quot;Cash payouts will continue to be rare events for FSLIC,&quot; Mr. Wall said. But he noted that both thrifts lacked any retail branches, and so wouldn't have been attractive for potential acquirers. The FSLIC prefers to handle insolvent thrifts by providing noncash assistance to acquirers.    Mr. Wall also noted that both thrifts were paying about 1.5 percentage points more for deposits than the thrift industry's national average cost of funds, currently 7.08%.    Thrift-industry executives were pleased by the Bank Board actions. &quot;It's good that we get those high-priced players out of the market,&quot; said Ray Martin, chairman of Coast Savings andamp; Loan Association, Los Angeles. However, Mr. Martin said that because of the two thrifts' narrow deposit base, &quot;it sounds like it won't have much impact&quot; on the cost of funds for healthy thrifts.    Both thrifts relied on so-called &quot;money desks&quot; to attract deposits by phone, largely from brokers, financial institutions and sophisticated individual investors. The average deposit size was about $90,000, and few accounts exceeded the $100,000 maximum covered by FSLIC insurance.    For those reasons, analysts said the two thrifts had little effect on retail deposit costs. &quot;I wouldn't expect this to affect the retail deposit structure in California,&quot; said Eric Hemel, a thrift analyst with First Boston Corp. in New York. He said the liquidations might lower the average cost of funds to California thrifts by about one basis point, which is one one-hundredth of a percentage point.    For example, although American Diversified was offering to pay 8% last week on a six-month deposit with a minimum amount of $90,000, healthy California thrifts were paying between 7.2% and 7.4% on a six-month deposit of $2,500. Banks, in contrast, were paying between 6.5% and 6.7%.    Moreover, many insolvent thrifts remain in the marketplace for so-called jumbo deposits of $90,000 or more, and the FSLIC lacks the cash to shut down other large ones anytime soon. &quot;It's not clear to me that this will have a significant impact,&quot; said Robert Dugger, an economist for the American Bankers Association. &quot;We still have a long way to go.&quot;    To have a significant impact on rates, Mr. Dugger said, the Bank Board must remove thrifts with at least 10% of the $145 billion in total assets of insolvent thrifts. American Diversified and North America represent less than 1% of that total, Mr. Dugger said.    In addition, FSLIC officials said at a news conference in Costa Mesa yesterday that they don't expect to make any other cash payouts of a similar size. The two liquidations cut the FSLIC's balance of cash and liquid assets to about $1.9 billion from more than $3 billion.    FSLIC sent out mailgrams yesterday containing the forms that depositors need to file claims for their insured deposits. FSLIC said it plans to mail most checks within 24 hours of receiving the claim forms. By announcing the liquidation on a Monday, rather than the agency's traditional Friday closing, FSLIC used the weekend to run various computer programs to prepare to issue the checks. Interest on deposits also accrued through Monday.    The FSLIC estimated that its total cost of the two liquidations, after selling assets of the thrifts, will be $931 million, including $798 million for American Diversified and $133 million for North America.    American Diversified grew from $11 million in assets in mid-1983 to $792 million at the end of 1984, making big loans to affiliated companies that specialized in syndicating tax-shelter investments, including an ethanol plant and a wind farm.    Regulators took over North America just hours after its owner, Duayne Christensen, a dentist, was killed when his Jaguar car slammed into a bridge abutment on a local freeway. He was headed for a meeting at which regulators demanded he produce evidence of a capital infusion or lose control of the thrift.    Regulators are pursuing lawsuits against Ranbir Sahni, the former owner of American Diversified, and against Mr. Christensen's estate and Janet McKenzie, Mr. Christensen's executive assistant. Mr. Sahni and Ms. McKenzie have denied the regulators' charges.    By March 31, Bank Board officials said, nonperforming assets represented 77% of American Diversified's portfolio and 98% of North America's portfolio. </TEXT></DOC>
