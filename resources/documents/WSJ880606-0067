The Honolulu-based airline also said the lease carries an option to buy, which the airline said it would eventually exercise. The delivery of the new jets, expected in the next few weeks, would restore the airline's fleet to 10 jets in time for the peak travel months of July and August.    A 19-year-old 737 owned by the airline was grounded after the top of its fuselage was torn off during an April 29 flight, killing a flight attendant. The next day, the airline also grounded three more of its older aircraft for inspection. </TEXT></DOC>
