The changes are being made after a new study by thedepartment and the Office of Management and Budgethighlighted problems in the guaranteed student-loan program,including the participation of &quot;too many shoddy schools&quot; andinadequate oversight of loan-guarantee agencies. The problemsled to last summer's collapse of the Higher EducationAssistance Foundation, a big loan-guarantee agency.</LP><TEXT>   At a news conference yesterday, Deputy Education SecretaryTed Sanders said the department plans to add about 150 newpeople to its financial-aid offices, centralizedecision-making and improve the aid program's data systems.He also said the department plans to ask Congress to cutschools from the loan program if the default rates amongtheir students exceed 25%. Under a new law, schools withdefault rates above 35% will be removed from the program.About 900 schools, most of them trade and proprietaryschools, now have default rates exceeding that threshold,according to the department.   The department has hired Michael Farrell, a New Hampshirebusinessman who was director of visitors in the Nixon WhiteHouse, to be the &quot;point person&quot; on student aid as a specialassistant to Education Secretary Lamar Alexander.   Education officials project loan defaults to climb to $2.7billion by the end of 1991, with loans outstanding growing to$55 billion.</TEXT></DOC>
