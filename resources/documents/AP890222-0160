Military spokesmen denied the ultimatum was a coup threat.   The official Sudan News Agency said Prime Minister Sadek Mahdimet throughout Wednesday with the disgruntled officers. Thegovernment said the premier called an emergency Cabinet meeting forThursday and planned to consult leading politicians about the crisis.   The reports appeared a day after Defense Minister Abdel-MagidKhalil, a former army general, resigned to protest the government'srefusal to accept a peace agreement negotiated by a major politicalparty. Khalil said Mahdi's policies have left the country starving,bankrupt and isolated from potential aid donors.   Also Tuesday, southern rebels said they shelled a governmentstronghold and major refugee center for the first time.   Virtually all Khartoum's papers reported the ``warningmemorandum,'' which apparently was issued Tuesday, but nonespecified what action the military chiefs would take.   The Communist Party organ Al-Maidan said the army warned it wouldretaliate if Mahdi tried to punish the memo's signers.   Army spokesman Brig. Mohamed Osman Malik confirmed the officerssubmitted to Mahdi a memorandum ``containing certain demands relatedto our problems and concerns.''   Asked whether the memo foreshadowed a military takeover, Maliktold The Associated Press: ``No, no. There is no coup. We havealready tried these coups in the past, and the army was the onlyloser.''   Another military spokesman said army officers had made ``certaindemands,'' but he would not characterize them as a coup threat.   Newspapers said army Gen. Fathi Ahmed Ali, thecommander-in-chief, led the meeting of about 150 officers thatdrafted the memorandum and gave it to Mahdi.   The document demanded the government ``choose between war andpeace, and prepare properly for its choice,'' the newspapers said.   Sudan has spent most of its 33 years of independence undermilitary rule. The longest spell was 16 years under dictator GaafarNimeiri, whose overthrow in 1985 led to a one-year transitionalmilitary government and Mahdi's election in April 1986.   On Tuesday night, Sudanese rebels said they shelled theprovincial capital of Juba, a major refugee center in southernSudan, destroying a military hospital and ``other vital targets.''   The Sudan People's Liberation Army broadcast, monitored inNairobi, Kenya, gave no casualty estimates and did not say when thebombardment occurred.   It was the first reported shelling of Juba since the revolt beganin 1983.   There was no comment on the reported shelling from the Sudanesegovernment in Khartoum, 725 miles to the north, and the broadcastcould not be confirmed.   Juba, a city of 150,000 people on the White Nile River, is thecapital of Sudan's southernmost province of Equatoria. More than50,000 refugees from fighting and famine elsewhere in Sudan havecrowded into Juba, where they have been supplied with food, clothingand medicine by the United Nations and other relief agencies.   The rebel broadcast urged civilians living near military targetsaround Juba to evacuate. The rebels also said it had cut road accessto the city.   The rebels are fighting the mainly Moslem government in the northto force economic and social reforms in the predominantly Christianand animist south.</TEXT></DOC>
