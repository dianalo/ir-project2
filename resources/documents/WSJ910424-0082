The announcement by Air Force Secretary Donald Rice givesLockheed, along with partners Boeing Co. and General DynamicsCorp., a decided edge over the rest of the aerospace industryby providing the opportunity to field a state-of-the-artaircraft combining stealth, speed and agility.</LP><TEXT>   The Advanced Tactical Fighter, which will replace the F-15Eagle, is potentially one of the most lucrative projectssince the early, halcyon days of the Reagan administration.Eventually, the Navy may choose a carrier-based version ofthe Lockheed fighter, the F-22, and foreign sales couldprovide billions of dollars of additional business. &quot;Thisabsolutely solidifies our future in military aircraftprograms,&quot; said Lockheed Chairman Daniel Tellep.   United Technologies Corp.'s Pratt andamp; Whitney division wonthe $9 billion competition to make the engines for the plane,which will be the first combat aircraft that can cruise atsupersonic speeds without using fuel-guzzling,radar-vulnerable afterburners.   Meanwhile, losers Northrop Corp. and McDonnell DouglasCorp. and engine builder General Electric Co. could findthemselves scrambling for orders at a time when overalldefense spending is likely to decline sharply. McDonnellDouglas, which dismissed thousands of workers after thePentagon canceled the Navy's A-12 attack plane earlier in theyear, said yesterday it would lay off an additional 500employees in the wake of the ATF defeat. Northrop said itexpects about 400 layoffs.   The Air Force decision was announced after the stockmarket closed. In composite trading on the New York StockExchange yesterday, Lockheed closed at $42.50 a share, up 25cents; General Dynamics closed at $36.875, up $1.875 a share;Boeing closed at $47.50, up 87.5 cents, and UnitedTechnologies closed at $45.125, up 50 cents. The losingbidders mostly were down for the day. Northrop closed at $27,down 25 cents; General Electric closed at $72.875 a share,down 50 cents, while McDonnell Douglas closed at $50.375 ashare, up 25 cents.   Securities analysts said they expected some movement todayin the stock prices of the winners and the losers, but not anoverwhelming swing either way because the investmentcommunity already had presumed the Lockheed team would win.   Long term, the fallout could be more serious. Northrop andMcDonnell Douglas will never recover any of the more than $1billion invested during the past five years in developingtheir proposed version of the ATF, called the F-23. Much ofthe next-generation technology used on their prototypeaircraft, known as Ghost One and Ghost Two to the controltower at Edwards Air Force Base in California, may nowvanish.   The announcement ensures that the winners will receivesome $13 billion for full-scale development of the ATFthrough 1996. The Air Force estimates that production of 650fighters will mean at least an additional $47 billion through2014.   Still, getting Congress to approve all of the money, whilethe Air Force also seeks funding for other big-ticket weaponsprograms, will be an uphill fight. For example, it becameclear during congressional hearings this week that because somuch money is needed for the ATF, the Air Force may not beable to develop an all-new replacement for its F-16 fighter.   Some congressional critics question whether the Air Forceeven needs the ATF in the post-Cold War world. But U.S.intelligence analysts maintain that such a high-tech fighteris essential to outmatch the radar-evading jets the SovietUnion is likely to deploy and sell to Third World countriesafter the turn of the century.   At a Pentagon news conference, Mr. Rice said the Lockheedplane &quot;clearly offered better capability with lower cost.&quot; Headded, &quot;I would not describe it as a split decision.&quot;   Industry experts had suggested that the Northrop F-23 wasthe swifter and stealthier of the two planes, and theLockheed F-22 more maneuverable. But the secretary indicatedthat there were only minor differences in the capabilities ofthe aircraft. Instead, he suggested, a differentiating factorwas how well the companies have &quot;performed in controllingcosts and meeting schedules&quot; on past Pentagon contracts.   Lockheed has had its share of problems, bungling, forexample, the Navy's now-terminated P-7 maritime patrol plane.But Northrop's reputation is more tarnished in the eyes ofmany lawmakers, following years of criminal and congressionalinquiries into the corporation's activities. A letter sentlast summer to Northrop from Jack Welch Jr., the Air Forceprocurement chief, criticized the company's &quot;recurringprogram problems.&quot;   Some industry officials and politicians believe the ATF'sprospects on Capitol Hill clearly will be bolstered becauseLockheed will assemble the aircraft in Georgia, the homestate of Sen. Sam Nunn, chairman of the Armed ServicesCommittee. Northrop would have built its plane in California.   But Mr. Rice asserted that parochial considerations didn'tenter into his decision, and that the Bush administrationdidn't try to influence him. &quot;I didn't even get significantpressure from members of Congress,&quot; he said.   Although Northrop officials were optimistic only a fewdays ago about the F-23's chances, Chairman Kent Kresa saidhe also was confident that the Air Force's choice was basedsolely on technical and cost factors. &quot;I have no reason tobelieve otherwise,&quot; he said.   Before yesterday's announcement, some observers wonderedif the Air Force wanted to place its three highest priorityprograms, Northrop's B-2 Stealth bomber, the ATF andMcDonnell Douglas's C-17 cargo plane, in the hands of justtwo companies. Similiarly, some questioned whether thePentagon would give GE the engine contract when it alreadybuilds the B-2's engines and powers the Navy's F/A-18,production of which is expected to continue into the late1990s.   But Mr. Rice said issues related to the U.S. industrialbase didn't influence his final pick. Besides the ATF, &quot;thereis still a substantial funding base for the aircraft industryout there,&quot; he said. Still, whether that is enough to sustainall of the current aircraft and engine makers, he cautioned,&quot;we will simply have to leave to market forces.&quot;   For Lockheed, the ATF win will provide steady revenuegrowth for its aircraft operations and help revive anunderutilized Marietta, Ga., facility. For Boeing, which hasa good part of its military business tied to nucleararmaments, the F-22 offers a way to branch into tacticalweaponry. And for General Dynamics, which could conceivablysee its F-16 fighter line wind down by late in the decade,the win will help stabilize employment at its Texasmilitary-aircraft factory. &quot;Frankly, things were kind ofgloomy&quot; there before the ATF award, said William Anders,General Dynamics' chairman.   The loss will increase Northrop's reliance on theembattled B-2 bomber, which accounts for some 60% of itsrevenue. Although McDonnell Douglas hopes to build astretched F/A-18 in years to come, it still needs to find&quot;some way of filling the void&quot; beyond that, said JohnCapellupo, president of the company's fighter division. Fornow, he added, &quot;this obviously will hurt the morale of ourpeople.&quot;   At a gathering near Lockheed's Burbank, Calif., plant,enthusiasm reigned yesterday. A company planner, DeneiceFisher, sobbed joyfully after the decision. &quot;We done good,&quot;said her husband, Steve Fisher, who managed avionics for theF-22 prototype.   Al Pruden, the Lockheed ATF program manager, lamented forthe losers. &quot;I've got a lot of friends at Northrop. I feelfor Northrop right now,&quot; he said. &quot;They must be hurting verybadly.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
