Background</ITAG>Section 502(c)(2) provides that the Secretary may assess a civil penaltyof up to $1,000 a day from the date of a plan administrator's failure orrefusal to file the annual report required to be filed under section 101(b)(4).\1\<NOTE/> ERISA section 101(b)(4) requires the administrator of anemployee benefit plan to file an annual report containing the informationrequired by section 103. Section 103 of ERISA and the Department's regulationsthereunder (29 CFR 2520.103-1 <T3>et seq.</T3>) describe the content of the annual report.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ Section 502(c)(2) was added to ERISA by section 9342(c)(2)of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987 (OBRA 1987, Pub. L. 100-203).Section 502(c)(2) also provides that an annual report that has been rejectedunder section 104(a)(4) for failure to provide material information shallnot be treated as having been filed with the Secretary. ERISA section 104(a)(4)provides, in relevant part, that the Secretary may reject any filing upondetermining that such filing is incomplete. Section 104(a)(5) describesvarious remedies available to the Secretary where a filing is rejectedand a revised filing satisfactory to the Secretary is not submitted within45 days.\2\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ Under section 104(a)(5), the Secretary may, in additionto engaging an independent qualified public accountant or an enrolled actuary,bring a civil action for appropriate legal or equitable relief or takeany other action authorized by Title I of ERISA, e.g., the assessment ofa civil penalty under section 502(c)(2).On October 17, 1988, the Department published a notice in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>(53 FR 40674) containing proposed regulationandSection; 2560.502c-2 relating to the manner in which the Department willassess civil penalties under section 502(c)(2). On the same date, the Departmentalso published a notice of proposed rulemaking in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>(53 FR 40677) relating to procedures for hearingsbefore an administrative law judge, and appeals, on assessment of penaltiesunder section 502(c)(2).In general, proposed regulation andSection; 2560.502c-2, discussed in detailbelow, addressed: the circumstances under which a penalty might be assessed(andSection; 2560.502c-2(a)); factors considered by the Department in determiningthe amount of a penalty (andSection; 2560.502c-2(b)); the provision of noticeto the administrator of the Department's intention to assess a penaltyandSection; 2560.502c-2(c)); waiver of all or part of the penalty by theDepartment upon a showing of reasonable cause and the requirements relatingto a showing of reasonable cause (andSection; 2560.502c-2(d) and (e)); theeffect of a failure to file a statement of reasonable cause (andSection;2560.502c-2(f)); the provision of notice to the administrator of the Department'sfindings as to reasonable cause and the effect of such notice where a penaltyis to be assessed (andSection; 2560.502c-2(g)); the effect of a request fora hearing before an administrative law judge (andSection; 2560.502c-2(h));service of notices (andSection; 2560.502c-2(i)); and the liability of theadministrator for assessed penalties (andSection; 2560.502c-2(j)).As indicated in the supplementary information accompanying the proposedregulation, the Department believes that the section 502(c)(2) sanctionis a valuable additional enforcement tool which is necessary to ensurecompliance with ERISA's annual reporting requirements. The Department alsobelieves that adoption of this regulation is necessary for the effectiveimplementation of its annual reporting enforcement program. In this regard,the Department also notes that section 9342(d)(2) of OBRA 1987 providesthat the Secretary shall issue regulations necessary to carry out the 502(c)(2)civil penalty provisions. Thus, the Department publishes this final regulation,and, separately, final procedural regulations relating to hearings andappeals on assessment of penalties under ERISA section 502(c)(2) (andSection;2570.60 et seq.). The notice of proposed rulemaking gave interested parties an opportunityto comment on the andSection; 2560.502c-2 proposal. In response, the Departmentreceived eight letters of comment concerning the regulation. The discussionbelow summarizes the proposed regulation, the issues raised by the commentatorsand the Department's reasons for adopting the provisions of the final regulation.<ITAG tagnum="84">B. Discussion of Regulation and Comments </ITAG><T3>General</T3>. A number of the commentators expressed general concernabout the Department's assessment of civil penalties under section 502(c)(2)and the potential adverse impact such penalties might have on plan administrators,particularly administrators of small plans, who are making good faith,diligent efforts to comply with ERISA's annual reporting requirements.One commentator suggested that, in order to ensure that oversight errorsdo not result in a penalty, the Department assess penalties only wherethere is an intentional withholding of information, plus a past patternof failure to reasonably comply with the annual reporting requirements.With regard to these concerns, it is the view of the Department that theprocedures being adopted in these final regulations, and the final regulationsrelating to hearings and appeals (andSection; 2570.60 et seq.), substantiallyreduce the possibility of a penalty being imposed on an administrator whodemonstrates good faith and diligence in complying with ERISA's annualreporting requirements. As explained in the supplementary information accompanyingthe proposal, penalties under section 502(c)(2) will be assessed only inthose instances where there is a failure or refusal to file any annualreport within the prescribed time frames \4\<NOTE/> or where, subsequent to notification that a filed reporthas been rejected and the reasons therefor, there is a failure or refusalto file a corrected report within the 45 day period prescribed in section104(a)(5). Section 104(a)(5) specifically contemplates that, where a filingis rejected under 104(a)(4), the filer will be afforded 45 days from thedate of the rejection to submit a revised filing satisfactory to the Secretary.Accordingly, in the case of a report rejected under section 104(a)(4),the administrator can avoid the assessment of any penalty under 502(c)(2)by making the necessary corrections to the filing within the prescribedtime frame. In addition, as reflected in the andSection; 2560.502c-2 regulation,penalties may be waived, in whole or in part, upon the administrator'sshowing of reasonable cause for the failure to file a complete report.Finally, the Department notes that an administrator may, in accordancewith the provisions of andSection; 2560.502c-2 and andSection; 2570.60 et seq.,request a hearing before an administrative law judge on the Department'sdecision to assess a civil penalty under section 502(c)(2). The Departmentbelieves, as indicated above, that these procedures, in addition to effortsto obtain filer compliance prior to the proposed assessment of a penalty,serve to reduce the possibility of penalties being assessed where thereis good faith compliance and diligence on the part of an administrator.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ ERISA section 104(a)(4) provides that the annual reportdescribed in section 103 is required to be filed within 210 days afterthe close of the plan year. However, an extension of time to file the annualreport may be granted by the Internal Revenue Service (<T3>See</T3>: Instructions to the Form 5500 Series). A number of the commentators also raised questions relating to the relationshipof the penalties under section 502(c)(2) to those penalties imposed bythe Internal Revenue Service for noncompliance with the annual reportingrequirements of the Internal Revenue Code (the Code), and the extent towhich the Department of Labor and the Internal Revenue Service will coordinatethe assessment of penalties. While the penalties under both section 502(c)(2)of Title I of ERISA and the Code (sections 6652 and 6692 of the Code) relateto annual reporting requirements which are generally satisfied by the filingof the Form 5500 Series and related schedules, The Title I and Code penaltiesare separate and independent penalties. Therefore, penalties under oneor both statutes could be assessed, or waived, in a given situation. Inthis regard, the Department will be coordinating its annual reporting complianceefforts with those of the Internal Revenue Service. A discussion of the specific provisions of the regulation and commentsthereon follows. 1. <T3>Scope</T3>. Proposed andSection; 2560.502c-2(a) addressed the generalapplication of section 502(c)(2). Paragraph (a)(1) provided that the administrator,as defined in ERISA section 3(16)(A), is liable for the penalties assessedunder section 502(c)(2) in each case in which there is a failure or refusalto file the annual report on behalf of an employee benefit plan subjectto the annual reporting requirements. Paragraph (a)(2) defined a failureor refusal to file the annual report as a failure or refusal to file, inwhole or in part, that information described in ERISA section 103 and andSection;2520.103-1, et seq., at the time and in the manner prescribed for suchfilings. One commentator, who indicated that subjecting administrators to a $1000a day penalty will only increase the burdens already imposed on small companies,recommended that the penalty provisions be limited to administrators ofplans with over 100 participants. It is the view of the Department thatthe only burdens directly attributable to the civil sanctions under section502(c)(2) are those which arise by virtue of noncompliance with the annualreporting requirements. In this regard, the Department can find no basisin the statute, the legislative history or otherwise for concluding thatthe administrators of small plans should be held to a lesser standard ofcompliance with applicable requirements than those of large plans. Accordingly,the final regulation, as proposed, will apply to any plan administrator(within the meaning of section 3(16)(A)) required to file an annual reportunder section 101(b)(4).2. <T3>Amount Assessed.</T3> Proposed andSection; 2560.502c-2(b)(1) providedthat the Department shall take into account the degree and willfulnessof the failure to file the annual report in determining the amount to beassessed under section 502(c)(2). Consistent with the terms of section502(c)(2), paragraph (b)(1) provided that the penalty assessed by the Departmentshall not exceed $1000 a day. With regard to the period for which a penaltymay be assessed, paragraph (b)(1) provided that the penalty will be computedfrom the date of the administrator's failure or refusal to file the annualreport and continue up to the date on which an annual report satisfactoryto the Secretary is filed. As explained in the supplementary informationaccompanying the proposed regulation, while the Department might assessa penalty for interim periods of noncompliance, liability for penaltiesunder section 502(c)(2) continue for each day up to the date complianceis achieved. A number of the commentators indicated that a $1000 a daypenalty appeared to be severe for reporting violations. In this regard,the Department notes that a $1000 a day penalty is the maximum penaltywhich can be assessed under section 502(c)(2) and, as provided in paragraph(b)(1) of the regulation, the Department will take into account the degreeand willfulness of the failure to file in determining the amount of thepenalty to be assessed. Paragraph (b)(1), therefore, is being adopted asproposed.Paragraph (b)(2) of the proposal provided for a limited tolling of thepenalty to permit plan administrators to present arguments to the Departmentconcerning any reasonable cause for the failure to file without continuingto incur penalties for the failure. As described in the supplementary informationaccompanying the proposal, where an administrator, upon receipt of a noticeof intent to access a penalty (as described in paragraph (c)), files astatement of reasonable cause (as described in paragraph (e)), no liabilityfor penalties will incur for any day starting from the date the Departmentserves the administrator a copy of the notice to assess a penalty untilthe day after the Department issues the notice of determination on thestatement of reasonable cause (as described in paragraph (g)). One commentatorsuggested that the regulation should be revised to make clear that penaltieswould be tolled whether or not the Department determined reasonable causeto exist. Paragraphs (b)(2) and (e) have been revised to make it clearthat if an administrator files the statement of reasonable cause describedin paragraph (e), penalties will be tolled for the described period regardlessof the Department's determination on that statement.Paragraph (b)(3) defined the date on which an administrator failed or refusedto file the annual report as the date on which the annual report was due,determined without regard to any extension for filing. Paragraph (b)(3),like section 502(c)(2) of the Act, also provided that an annual reportwhich is rejected under section 104(a)(4) for a failure to provide materialinformation shall be treated as a failure to file the annual report. Asindicated in the suplementary information accompanying the proposal, materialinformation, for purposes of this provision, would be any information requiredto be included on, or as part of, the annual report which is necessaryto process, verify or analyze an annual report.One commentator indicated that the extension period should be considered,so that the failure or refusal to file is not considered to have takenplace until after the expiration of the extension period. In the supplementaryinformation accompanying the proposal, the Department expressed the viewthat in those situations where an extension of time is granted for thefiling of the annual report and the administrator fails either to filea timely report or a complete report within the extension period, the administratorshould not, for purposes of the 502(c)(2) penalty, benefit from the requestedextension. The Department has not changed its view in this regard. Accordingly,for purposes of paragraph (b)(3) of the final regulation, the date on whichthe annual report was due is, as proposed, determined without regard toany extension of time granted for the filing of the report.Another commentator suggested that paragraph (b)(3) be revised to makeclear that, in the case of a rejected report, a failure to file occursonly where the administrator fails to correct a report within the 45 dayperiod prescribed in section 104(a)(5). The Department has modified paragraph(b)(3) in the final regulation to clarify the application of the 45 dayperiod for correcting deficient reports.3. <T3>Notice of Penalty. </T3>Proposed andSection; 2560.502c-2(c) providedthat, prior to the assessment of any penalty under section 502(c)(2), theDepartment shall provide the administrator with a written notice indicatingthe Department's intention to assess a penalty, the amount of the penalty,the period to which the penalty applies, and the reasons for the penalty.This notice would be served in accordance with the service of notice provisionsof andSection; 2560.502c-2(i). Under andSection; 2560.502c-2(f) of the regulation,this notice will become a final order of the Secretary, within the meaningof andSection; 2570.61(g) (See: andSection; 2570.60 et seq. also appearingin today's <T4>Federal Register</T4>), within 30 days of the service of notice, unlessthe statement of reasonable cause, described in andSection; 2560.502c-2(e),is filed with the Department. No comments were received on this paragraph;accordingly, paragraph (c) is being adopted without modification.4. <T3>Waiver of Penalty. </T3>Paragraphs (d), (e), (f), (g), and (h) of theproposed andSection; 2560.502c-2 generally related to the waiver of penaltiesunder section 502(c)(2). Paragraph (d) provided that the Department maywaive all or part of the penalty to be assessed under section 502(c)(2)upon a showing of reasonable cause for the failure to file the annual report.Paragraph (e) provided that, subsequent to the issuance of a notice ofthe Department's intent to access a penalty, the administrator shall have30 days from the date of the service of notice to make an affirmative showingof reasonable cause for the failure to file a complete annual report orwhy the penalty, as calculated, should not be assessed. Paragraph (e) requiredthat the statement be in the form of a written statement which sets forthall the facts alleged in support of reasonable cause and contains a declarationthat the statement is made under penalties of perjury.Paragraph (f) described the effect of a failure to file the statement ofreasonable cause within the prescribed 30 day period. Paragraph (f) providedthat a failure on the part of the administrator to file a timely statementof reasonable cause will constitute a waiver of the right to appear andcontest the facts alleged in the notice and an admission of the facts allegedin the notice for purposes of any adjudicatory proceeding involving theassessment of a penalty under section 502(c)(2). Under paragraph (f), theDepartment's notice of intent to assess a penalty, described in paragraph(c), then becomes a final order of the Secretary, within the meaning ofparagraph (g) of andSection; 2570.61 (<T3>See</T3>: andSection; 2570.60 et seq. published in today's <T4>Federal Register</T4>).Paragraph (g)(1) provided that, following a review of the facts allegedin the statement of reasonable cause, the Department shall notify the administratorof its intention to waive the penalty, in whole or in part, and/or assessa penalty. If it is the intention of the Department to assess a penalty,the notice shall indicate the amount of the penalty. Under paragraph (g)(2),this notice becomes a final order 30 days after the date of the serviceof the notice, except as provided in paragraph (h). In general, paragraph(h) provided that the notice described in paragraph (g) shall not becomea final order if, within the 30 days of the date of service of notice,the administrator initiates an adjudicatory proceeding under section 18of Title 29, as modified by the 502(c)(2) procedural regulations (andSection;2570.60 et seq.) also published in today's <T4>Federal Register</T4>. Specifically, the administrator is requiredto file, within 30 days of the date of the service of notice, an answer,as defined in andSection; 2570.61(c), in accordance with andSection; 2570.62.One commentator, noting that paragraph (d) of the proposal permits, butdoes not require, the Department to waive all or part of a penalty on ashowing of reasonable cause, recommended that the regulation be revisedto require a waiver of the entire penalty where an administrator showsreasonable cause. The Department anticipates that 502(c)(2) penalties willbe waived to the extent reasonable cause is demonstrated by a plan administrator.However, the Department also believes that there may be instances wherethe demonstrated reasonable cause justifies only a partial waiver of thepenalty. For example, the Department proposes to assess a 60 day penaltyand the administrator files a statement which demonstrates that reasonablecause existed for a 30 day period, but not for the 60 day period for whichthe penalty was assessed. Rather than having to assess or waive the entirepenalty for the full 60 day period, the Department believes that it isin the interest of both the administrator and the Department to retainthe flexibility to waive penalties in whole or in part. Accordingly, paragraph(d) is being adopted without modification.With respect to paragraph (e), regarding the showing of ``reasonable cause'',one commentator suggested that the Department revise the regulation toclarify that administrators who make good faith and diligent efforts tocomply with the reporting requirements will not be subject to a penalty.As explained above, the Department believes that the procedures establishedunder the regulations for considering reasonable cause, as well as appealsof the Department's decisions on reasonable cause, are sufficiently flexibleto ensure that appropriate consideration is given to good faith and diligentefforts to comply with the annual reporting requirements. Another commentator,noting that there are many factors that could result in a delay in filingor in an incorrect filing, supported the Department's approach is not attemptingto specifically define the circumstances under which reasonable cause wouldexist. Accordingly, except for the clarification changes discussed withrespect to paragraph (b)(2), paragraph (e) is being adopted without modification.One commentator, noting that, under paragraph (f), a failure to file astatement of reasonable cause within the 30 day period described in paragraph(e) resulted in a waiver of the right to appear and contest the facts allegedin the notice of intent to assess a penalty and an admission of such factsfor purposes of the 502(c)(2) penalty, indicated that it was unreasonablenot to provide for some allowance for the possibility of mitigating circumstanceswhich would explain the failure to respond within the 30 day period. Itis the view of the Department that the 30 day period prescribed in theregulation provides administrators more than ample time to file a statementof reasonable cause and thereby apprise the Department of extenuating circumstances.Moreover, as discussed above, the notice of intent to assess a penaltywill, in the case of a report which is rejected under section 104(a)(4),be preceded by an effort to obtain filer compliance, notice that the reporthas been rejected and an opportunity to correct, thereby providing theadministrator with an early opportunity to apprise the Department of possibleextenuating circumstances which might affect the assessment of a penalty.Paragraph (f), therefore, is being adopted as proposed. No comments were received on paragraph (g); accordingly, paragraph (g)is being adopted without modification. 5. <T3>Service of Notices</T3>. Proposed andSection; 2560.502c-2(i) describedthe manner in which the notice of intent to assess a penalty, describedin paragraph (c), and the notice of determination on a statement of reasonablecause, described in paragraph (g), will be served. Under paragraph (i)of the proposed regulation service of notice could be accomplished by:(1) delivering a copy to the administrator or representative; (2) leavinga copy at the principal office, place of business, or residence of theadministrator or representative thereof; or (3) mailing a copy to the lastknown address of the administrator or representative thereof. One commentatorexpressed concern that mailing notice to the last known address may notin every case be adequate, because some sponsors, particularly smallerones, are in businesses which tend to move frequently. In response to thiscomment, the Department has revised paragraph (i) by adding a new subparagraphrelating to when service is deemed to occur. Specifically, new subparagraph(i)(2) provides that if service is accomplished by certified mail, serviceis complete upon mailing, and if done by regular mail, service is completeonly upon receipt. 6. <T3>Liability</T3>. Proposed andSection; 2560.502c-2(j) clarified the liabilityof the parties for penalties assessed under section 502(c)(2). Paragraph(1) provided that, if more than one person is responsible as administratorfor the failure to file the annual report, all such persons shall be jointlyand severally liable for such failure. Paragraph (2) provided that anyperson against whom a penalty is assessed under section 502(c)(2) is personallyliable for the payment of such penalty. Paragraph (2) is intended to makeclear that liability for the payment of penalties assessed under section502(c)(2) is a personal liability of the person against whom the penaltyis assessed and not a liability of the plan. Accordingly, as indicatedin the supplementary information accompanying the proposal, the paymentof penalties assessed under section 502(c)(2) from assets of a plan wouldnot constitute a reasonable expense of administering the plan for purposesof ERISA sections 403 and 404. No comments were received on paragraph (j); therefore, paragraph (j) isbeing adopted without modification. 7. <T3>Effective Date</T3>. Pursuant to section 9342(d)(1) of the OmnibusBudget Reconciliation Act of 1987, the civil penalty provisions of section502(c)(2) apply with respect to reports required to be filed after December31, 1987. As indicated in the supplementary information accompanying theproposal, the Department has interpreted this effective date provisionto refer to annual reports required to be filed for plan years beginningafter December 31, 1987, rather than the 1987 plan year annual reportsfiled in 1988. Accordingly, the proposal provided that the regulation would,upon adoption, be effective with respect to annual reports required tobe filed for plan years beginning on or after January 1, 1988. One commentator suggested that employers with fewer than 100 employeesbe afforded the opportunity to file annual reports without penalty untilthe first plan year beginning in 1989. As discussed above, the effectivedate of the 502(c)(2) civil sanctions was established by Congress undersection 9342(d)(1) of OBRA 1987. Moreover, the Department believes that,with the enactment of the 502(c)(2) civil sanction provisions on December22, 1987 and the Department's publication in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of proposed regulations relating to the 502(c)(2)civil sanctions on October 17, 1988, the public has had an adequate opportunityto become aware of the new sanctions for noncompliance with the annualreporting requirements. For these reasons, the final regulations will,as proposed, be effective with respect to annual reports required to befiled for plan years beginning on or after January 1, 1988. The Departmentnotes that, in general, annual reports for calendar year plans would befiled in July 1989. <ITAG tagnum="84">Executive Order 12291 Statement </ITAG>The Department has determined that this regulation does not constitutea ``major rule'' as that term is used in Executive Order 12291 becausethe action would not result in annual effect on the economy of $100 million;a major increase in costs or prices for consumers, individual industries,government agencies, or geographic regions; or significant adverse effectson competition, employment, investment, productivity, innovation, or onthe ability of the United States-based enterprises to compete with foreign-basedenterprises in domestic or export markets.<ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Flexibility Act Statement </ITAG>This regulation does not have any significant impact on a substantial numberof small entities, and contains no reporting and disclosure requirements.The primary purpose of the regulation is to clarify the manner in whichpenalties under section 502(c)(2) of ERISA will be assessed by the Departmentfor a failure or refusal to file the annual report in accordance with thestatutory and regulatory annual reporting requirements. In the cases wherea deficient report is filed, plan administrators will be afforded the opportunityto correct the deficiencies prior to the assessment of any penalty. Inaddition, in all cases in which the Department intends to assess a penalty,the penalty may be waived, in whole or in part, upon a showing of reasonablecause for the failure to comply. In view of the potentially limited circumstancesunder which penalties might be assessed pursuant to this regulation, theDepartment believes that this regulation will not have a significant impacton small employee benefit plans or substantially affect small entitieswhich provide services to such plans. <ITAG tagnum="84">Paperwork Reduction Act </ITAG>This regulation does not contain any new information collection requirementsand does not modify any existing requirements.
