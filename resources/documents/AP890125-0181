The one-paragraph report did not elaborate.   Nine Americans, three Britons, an Irishman, an Italian and aBelgian are missing in Lebanon.   American journalist Terry Anderson, 42, Chief Middle Eastcorrespondent for The Associated Press, is the longest-held of thecaptives. He was kidnapped March 16, 1985.   An-Nahar has been cautious in its hostage reporting and has notmade unfulfilled predictions or reported developments which laterturned out to be false.   Iran has been trying to improve political and trade ties with theWest since last summer, when it agreed to a cease-fire in itseight-year war with Iraq.</TEXT></DOC>
