Abbas, also known by his guerrilla code-name of Abu Mazen, saidthe PLO ``is trying to upgrade the level of the dialogue and to haveit held in other places.''   Asked about alternative venues, he said,``Such as Washington.''   In Washington on Friday, President Bush said that it was ``toosoon'' to consider moving U.S.-PLO contacts to a higher level.   Former President Reagan in December assigned the Americanambassador to Tunisia, Robert Pelletreau Jr. to open the dialogue.The PLO has its headquarters in Tunis.   The move ended a 13-year American ban on contacts with the PLO.The ban was lifted after PLO chief Yasser Arafat's explicitrecognition in December of Israel's right to exist and hisrenunciation of terrorism.   Abbas said the PLO leadership had asked Pelletreau to fix a datefor the next U.S.-Palestinian meeting, which would be the firstunder the Bush presidency.   He said that when the issue of terrorism came up at the firstdialogue session, the PLO said it was against attacks on ``civiliansoutside the (Israeli-)occupied territories... and against killingcivilians inside the occupied territories, the crime committed dailyby the Israeli forces against the Palestinian people.''   Abbas added: ``But our resistance against the Israeli militaryoccupation will continue and will not be suspended.''   He was referring to the 13-month-old uprising by 1.7 millionPalestinians in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.</TEXT></DOC>
