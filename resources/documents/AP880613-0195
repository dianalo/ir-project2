The charges accuse 34-year-old Peter Friesen of providing theSoviets with information about his job and trying to infiltrate aWest German political party, said chief federal prosecutor KurtRebmann in a statement.   He said Friesen was trained by the Soviet secret police andintelligence agency in using coded messages before he emigrated toWest Germany in 1981.   The statement said Friesen stopped his espionage activities inNovember 1985 on KGB orders after West Germany's chief ofcounter-espionage, Hans-Joachim Tiedge, defected to East Germany.   Friesen was arrested in March along with six other suspectedSoviet KGB agents in what Rebmann said at the time was a majorcrackdown on Soviet spying activity in West Germany.   Alexander Prechtel, spokesman for the federal prosecutor'soffice, on Monday declined to provide further details on Friesen'scase, including where he worked.   No trial date was set, he said in a telephone interview.   Five of the seven arrested remain in investigative custody.Investigations against the other two are continuing although theyare no longer in custody, Prechtel said.</TEXT></DOC>
