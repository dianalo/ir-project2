(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A former Unisys Corp. executive whoadmitted creating a slush fund to bribe officials and make illegalcampaign contributions received a 32-month sentence today for hisrole in the Pentagon procurement scandal.   Charles F. Gardner, 58, was also fined $40,000 for what theprosecutor called improper conduct that was ``a qualitative,quantitative leap from what has been before this court'' in a stringof other defense procurement criminal cases.   James G. Neal, a former consultant to Unisys who admitted helpingGardner bribe a Navy official for sensitive bid information on agovernment contract, received a 27-month sentence and was fined$30,000.   Gardner, who admitted bribing former Pentagon official MelvynPaisley by purchasing Paisley's ski resort condominium for aninflated price, was described by Assistant U.S. Attorney JosephAronica as ``a major figure in this investigation.''   But Aronica, citing Gardner's cooperation with the continuinginvestigation since his March 10 guilty plea, joined the defense inurging U.S. District Judge Claude Hilton to show some degree ofleniency.   Defense attorney Gary Naftalis said Gardner's cooperation hadalready led to six guilty pleas and ``will lead to more and moreconvictions'' of ``individuals and corporations.''   Gardner apparently is providing information to prosecutors aboutthe role of his former superiors at Sperry Corp., which becameUnisys Corp. following a takeover by Burroughs Corp.   Unisys says it is also cooperating with the probe, nicknamed``Operation Ill Wind.''   According to court papers in another case, Gardner obtainedapproval from a superior to bribe a former Navy engineer, Garland L.Tomlin Jr., who is awaiting sentencing on his guilty plea for taking$400,000 from the company and $75,000 from Honeywell Inc., for bidinformation.   Hilton said Gardner was ``more culpable than the defendants thathave been previously before me to be sentenced.'' But the judge saidhe ``recognized the extent of the cooperation'' that Gardner hadgiven prosecutors.   Because of that cooperation, Hilton agreed to depart fromsentencing guidelines, which called for a prison term rangingbetween 46 and 57 months.   Many of the previous defendants sentenced by Hilton in the casehad received sentences of about 24 to 25 months.   Aronica said Gardner created a slush fund to finance ``a broadspectrum of criminal activity.''   ``It was the American taxpayer that ended up footing the bill forthese activities'' because Gardner billed the Pentagon to replenishthe slush fund by filing phony invoices.   Gardner's concern about preserving government contracts forUnisys by paying bribes and making illegal campaign contributions``can in no way excuse or lessen the severity of what he directedand orchestrated.'' Aronica said.   Aronica described Neal as ``the banker for Mr. Gardner and Mr.Gardner's operation.'' But Neal ``knew what was going on'' with themoney that he placed in various accounts for the slush fund, Aronicasaid.   ``His involvement was as serious or more serious than thosepreviously sentenced by this court,'' Aronica told Hilton.   According to court papers, Gardner arranged in 1986 to have Nealpurchase Paisley's condominium in Sun Valley, Idaho, at a price thatwas $49,000 above what he sold it for a year later.   Paisley, former assistant Navy secretary for research,engineering and systems, has not been charged in the case.   Neal, who also pleaded guilty March 10, admitted transferring$400,000 to the Bahamas account of a company Tomlin set up in orderto influence decisions on the Navy contract.</TEXT></DOC>
