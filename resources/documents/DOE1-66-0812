This is the first (December, 1987)of a series of 3 articles to be included in the monthly magazine, KokusaiShigen. The total OPEC oil output (including natural gas) decreased dramaticallyduring the period from 1980 through 1985 as shown in its decline from31.5 million B/D in 1979 down to 18.4 million B/D in 1983. Besides oilprices dropped tragically in 1986 and the compound effects of these affectedtremendously the revenue of oil producing countries. As the domains whichreceived the above effects most strongly, the four domains namely internationalproblems, stability of internal politics, economy and oil policy areselected. In this first article, first of all the Iraqui-Iranian Warwas discussed in the chapter of international problems. The decreaseof the revenue from oil has been giving both countries a relative effectin the same degree, but the absolute loss of Iraq is greater than thatof Iran. However, the decline of revenue only reduces severity of militaryactivities and does not terminate the war rapidly. Interference by theoutside powers will increase.</TEXT></DOC>
