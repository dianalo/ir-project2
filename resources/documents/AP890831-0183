De Mita told a meeting of party leaders late Thursday that hewould stay on as Christian Democrat president after receivingassurances that his opinions would be respected.   Only hours earlier, he told reporters he had resigned because ofconcerns the party ``gives the impression of being in a differentfrequency than mine.''   The decision to stay on appeared to represent a gain for DeMita's wing of the Christian Democrats, considered on the ``left''of the party. Its members had been criticized and excluded from topgovernment posts since Christian Democrat Giulio Andreotti succeededDe Mita as premier in July.   Andreotti's faction of the party is considered more traditionaland closer to the Roman Catholic Church.   The support De Mita received in party leaders' speeches Thursdayalso patched over a growing breach in the party, which has been themost important force in Italian government since World War II.   ``Andreotti has responded in a convincing way,'' De Mita saidThursday evening, referring to the premier's public plea to De Mitato remain in his post.   De Mita, 61, is credited with reversing the sliding electoralfortunes of Italy's dominant party during his seven-year term asparty secretary, which ended in February.   He was then moved to party president, a position with lessauthority, post, because of charges by party members that he heldtoo much power.   The move led to the collapse of De Mita's 13-month-old governmentin May. Andreotti then formed Italy's 49th postwar government withthe party's same five coalition partners: Christian Democrats,Socialists, Social Democrats, Liberals and Republicans.   Political observers had speculated that a De Mita resignationcould lead to a split in the Christian Democrat Party. Such adivision would radically change the political landscape in Italy,where the Christian Democrats have been the main force keeping theCommunists out of power.</TEXT></DOC>
