The cut is the first since last May, when the rate wasreduced by one point to 12.5%, and signals the Bank ofItaly's approval of the latest attempt to keep state financesunder control. The discount rate is the central bank'sminimum lending rate to financial institutions.</LP><TEXT>   The move will immediately help the Treasury by loweringinterest payments on the public debt, as well as cuttingborrowing costs for private industry at a time of fallingprofits and sluggish demand.   However, by simply bringing official interest rates moreinto line with money market rates, which have already fallenby more than one percentage point since the start of theyear, the reduction doesn't reflect a change in monetarypolicy, which remains tight.   The budget package approved by the cabinet, which pavedthe way for the rate reduction, averted the threat of arenewed political crisis less than a month after the latestgovernment was formed.   Treasury Minister Guido Carli threatened to resign earlierthis month unless the government agreed on firm action tokeep public spending under control. He was persuaded to staynot only by the budget accord but also by a pledge from PrimeMinister Giulio Andreotti that a bill reforming the country'snear-bankrupt pension system would be presented to Parliamentby mid-June.   High social security payments to finance the monopolystate pension system are a major factor in driving up thecost of labor to private industry, hurting competitiveness.At the same time pension contributions barely cover half thesystem's costs, the ban on companies' operating privatepension plans deprives the Milan stock market of an importantsource of institutional funds.   Pension contributions are being increased immediately aspart of the measures to plug the deficit, while the June billwill propose various changes including raising the retirementage, possibly by five years to 65 for men and 60 for women.   Mr. Carli is also pushing for a cut in retirementbenefits, which are currently 80% of the average salary overthe last five years worked.   The budget package is split roughly equally betweenrevenue increases and spending cuts. Higher taxes will belevied on spirits and luxury goods such as mobile telephones,high-powered motorbikes, pleasure boats and four-wheel-drivevehicles.</TEXT></DOC>
