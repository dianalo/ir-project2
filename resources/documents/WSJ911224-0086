Despite the delay, the company still expects to beginregular production shipments in midyear and generate about$50 million in 1992 revenue from the new product, a diskarray system that represents a sharp change in disk-storagesystems.</LP><TEXT>   Still, the announcement made investors nervous that thecompany, which has spent several years developing theproduct, code-named Iceberg, may experience further delays.Storage Technology's stock sank $3 a share, to $37.50,yesterday in late New York Stock Exchange trading.   Storage Technology is one of several companies working ona disk array system, which uses a series of relativelyinexpensive, small-capacity disk drives and smart software toprovide massive storage for mainframe computers. One of thedrives' most appealing features is that they are faulttolerant, meaning that data won't be lost and the systemwon't have to be shut down if some of the disks fail. Currentdisk products consist of a stack of large, expensiveplatters. If one platter fails, the whole system may have tobe shut down to retrieve the data, and data can bepermanently lost.   Stephen Cohen, a managing director at SoundView FinancialGroup Inc., said the first company to bring such a product tomarket will be able to set its price because customers arehungry for large, reliable storage systems. He estimates thatStorage Technology's systems could be priced at $700,000 to$1.7 million and that the company could ship 160 to 175 unitsnext year if it can stay on schedule. The company wouldn'trecord these as revenue, however, until the customers acceptthem.   &quot;This is an enormous market opportunity,&quot; he said. Mr.Cohen said he expects International Business Machines Corp.and other large competitors to have similar drives out by1993 or 1994.   Although the initial shipments, to a handful of customers,have been delayed, Storage Technology said it believes &quot;somecushion remains&quot; for it to meet its 1992 revenue projection.The company said it won't send out the first machines untilit completes testing of the software and finishes the systemsintegration. Storage Technology said it will introduce themachines formally on Jan. 28.</TEXT></DOC>
