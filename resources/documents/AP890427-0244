DOYLE</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A federal judge says convicted stock speculatorIvan F. Boesky has already gotten a lot of breaks and doesn'tdeserve to get out of prison early.   U.S. District Judge Morris E. Lasker rejected a request byBoesky, who has already served one year of a three-year prisonterm, to cut his sentence to time served, paving the way for hisimmediate release.   ``I cannot in good conscience conclude that, commendable asBoesky's behavior has been since he was sentenced, he should begiven further credit,'' Lasker ruled Wednesday.   There was no answer at the offices of Boesky lawyers in New Yorkand Washington when called for comment Wednesday evening.   Once one of the leading speculators on the stock of potentialtakeover targets, Boesky pleaded guilty to one felony count as partof a plea bargain. Boesky, 52, also agreed to pay a then-record$100 million in 1986 to settle civil insider trading chargesbrought by the Securities and Exchange Commission.   He has since supplied information used toward civil or criminalcharges in more than a dozen cases here and in Britain. Inexchange, he was allowed to plead guilty to one count of conspiracyto lie to the SEC.   The maximum penalty he faced was five years in prison, andLasker, who has a reputation as a lenient sentencer, handed Boeskya three-year term.   Lasker noted that even without any actions by him or the paroleboard, ``Boesky will be released from custody less than a year fromtoday, which is to say, that the actual period he will have servedwill be slightly more than two years. Such a sentence is not unjustin the circumstances.''   Boesky's earliest non-parole release date based on good behavioris April 4, 1990.   Boesky claimed that his help led to a record plea bargain dealby Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. and the subsequent indictment of itsjunk bond chief, Michael Milken, and others on racketeering andsecurities fraud charges.   Lasker said he took Boesky's ``unprecedented'' cooperation intoaccount when he passed sentence.   Federal prosecutors took no stand on releasing Boesky early butthey noted in a letter to Lasker, who sentenced Boesky Dec. 18,1987, that the Milken indictment and the $650 million tentativesettlement of criminal charges Drexel reached with the governmentwas ``the centerpiece of Boesky's cooperation.''   The letter continued: ``Boesky's disclosures were the essentialcatalyst for all that has been and remains to be revealed in thosecases. Other investigations arising directly from Boesky'sdisclosures have also matured since Boesky's sentencing.''   But it added that ``the government nevertheless articulated thevalue of that cooperation in unqualified terms when Boesky wassentenced.''</TEXT></DOC>
