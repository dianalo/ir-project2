Teledyne's Relays division, which has been part of anongoing federal investigation, has been unable &quot;for severalmonths&quot; to make any sales to the government, a Teledynespokesman confirmed. The unit provides relays for electronicequipment and systems to industrial companies and thegovernment, including the National Aeronautical and SpaceAdministration. Such relays are used in an array of militaryequipment, and in missile guidance and satellite launchings.</LP><TEXT>   The Teledyne spokesman declined to comment on the amountof lost sales or the status of the investigation, adding,&quot;whether there will be an indictment or not is anyone'sguess.&quot;   Last October, Federal Bureau of Investigation agentsraided the Teledyne Relay division in Hawthorne, Calif., andcarried off files of documents and other written materials.   The suspension was made public in connection with thefiling of a lawsuit by a former quality control manager forthe Teledyne unit, Emil Stache. The lawsuit accused Teledyneand its Relays unit of wrongfully firing Mr. Stache becausehe allegedly wouldn't falsify test results on electronicequipment used by the U.S. military. Mr. Stache, in a lawsuitfiled in Los Angeles County Superior Count, said that between1984 and 1990 Teledyne's relays &quot;continued to experiencetesting failures,&quot; but that the company &quot;routinely submittedreports to the government indicating that the relays passedthe testing.&quot; The Teledyne spokesman declined to comment onthe lawsuit.</TEXT></DOC>
