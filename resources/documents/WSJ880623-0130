The consolidation of the operations into four areas from seven is part of the telecommunication company's restructuring, which was announced in March, to cut employment and centralize operations.    A GTE spokeswoman, however, said the company still couldn't say how many of the 82,000 employees in the U.S. telephone operations would lose their jobs, or how much money the consolidation is expected to save in the business, which has $12 billion in annual sales and operates in 33 states.    GTE also said recommendations regarding the proposed location for the telephone business's U.S. headquarters are still being reviewed. The current headquarters are here and in Dallas.    The redrawn operating areas and their headquarters are: GTE North, Westfield, Ind.; GTE South, Tampa, Fla.; and GTE West, Thousand Oaks, Calif. GTE Southwest area will continue to operate from its headquarters in San Angelo and Irving, Texas.    The new North area includes Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana, Michigan, Illinois, Wisconsin, Iowa, Minnesota, Nebraska and Missouri.    The new South area includes: North Carolina and South Carolina, Virginia, West Virginia, Kentucky, Tennessee, Georgia, Alabama and Florida.    The new West area includes Hawaii, Alaska, Washington, Idaho, Montana, Oregon and California.    The Southwest area will continue to include Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas and New Mexico. </TEXT></DOC>
