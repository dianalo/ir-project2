Rebels said they would give up theother base today, news reports said.   Questions persisted about whether a secret deal was made with therebels, who demanded an end to prosecution of officers charged withhuman rights abuses during eight years of military dictatorship thatended in 1983.   Defense Minister Horacio Juanarena was to brief the Senate onWednesday on how the government ended the uprising, which Argentinesconsidered a threat to their 5-year-old democracy.   President Raul Alfonsin has said no concessions were made to therebels. In brief comments to reporters at Government House today,Alfonsin stressed the need to end the revolt ``avoiding bloodshedthat could have involved hundreds of Argentines.''   Rebel spokesmen denied they surrendered and said they negotiateda cease-fire that allows them to return, unpunished, to their units.The army said today that the rebels ``are at their units inaccordance with orders'' of the army chief, Lt. Gen. Jose DanteCaridi.   It did not elaborate.   The leader of the estimated 500 rebels, army Col. Mohamed AliSeineldin, surrendered Sunday night to military authorities butreturned to the rebel arsenal later to supervise the dismantling ofdefenses, including trenches and land mines, at the arsenal.   On Monday night, he turned over the arsenal at Villa Martelli onthe outskirts of Buenos Aires.   There had been conflicting reports concerning the timing ofSeineldin's surrender. Initial reports said he surrendered Sunday,but unconfirmed reports later said he turned himself in on Monday.Officials today said the actural surrender was Sunday.   The revolt began Thursday, when an elite coast guard unitmutinied and joined troops who rebelled Friday at the suburban Campode Mayo base. Most of those rebels moved to Villa Martelli baseSaturday.   Seineldin organized the dismantling of the defenses, includingtrenches and land mines, he and his comrades had set up at thearsenal.   The army, in its statement today, said Seineldin is under arrestat a unidentified Buenos Aires garrison and will be questioned by amilitary judge. No mention was made of a trial or punishment for himor his supporters.   More rebels were at a base at Mercedes, about 60 miles west ofthe capital. The government news agency Telam said rebels intendedto turn over that base to the government today.   The insurrection began before dawn Thursday and was the thirdmilitary uprising in 20 months and the rebels' demands, includingfor a change in the military hierarchy and better pay, were alsobehind the two previous revolts.   It was clear this time that the rebels had wide supportthroughout the army. Five bases openly supported the mutineers andunits at several others refused to help the government.   On Sunday, three people were killed when civilians outside VillaMartelli began throwing rocks and bottles at the rebels, who firedback, police said. La Nacion newspaper said police believe many ofthe estimated 600 demonstrators were from the Montonero urbanguerrilla group.   The government had claimed victory early Monday, saying themilitary rebellion was over. But the public was skeptical becauseSeineldin and many of the renegades remained at the Villa Martellibase.   In contrast to the current situation, soldiers who participatedin an April 1987 uprising were arrested, held incommunicado andtaken to military prison. Soon afterward, however, three-fourths ofthe army's top generals were removed and Alfonsin proposedlegislation limiting prosecution for human rights offenses only tothe highest-ranking officers.   From 1976 to 1983, the country's military rulers conducted aso-called ``dirty war'' against leftists in which an estimated 9,000people disappeared.</TEXT></DOC>
