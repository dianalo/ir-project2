Code named &quot;Operation Pennycon,&quot; the sting used an FBIagent posing as a promoter of low-priced stocks to netindictments last April against 18 brokers and four firmsacross the country. The operation was touted at the time bythe U.S. attorney's office in Denver as the first to surfaceamong other undercover investigations of penny-stock fraud.The sting had the blessing and cooperation of the Securitiesand Exchange Commission and the National Association ofSecurities Dealers, which operates the over-the-countermarket.</LP><TEXT>   The verdict on Friday by a six-woman, six-man jury inDenver was a stunning setback for the government. After asix-week trial, the jury acquitted three of the firms and 11individuals of 16 counts each of conspiracy and securities,mail and wire fraud. The other firm and remaining individualswill be tried in a separate case.   &quot;This unfortunately is a case we lost,&quot; William McLucas,head of enforcement for the SEC, said. &quot;But it doesn't raiselarger issues as to whether we will continue to investigatepenny-stock fraud. We will. People should assume that,&quot; hesaid. U.S. attorneys in Denver and spokesmen for the FBI inWashington and Denver didn't return telephone calls seekingcomment.   The undercover FBI agent was a weak linchpin of thegovernment's case, said attorneys and defendants involved inthe case. &quot;They sent into the industry an undercover agentwith no experience in the business&quot; who failed to suggest tothe defendants that he wanted them to do anything illegal,said Stanley Marks, an attorney for New York broker MosheRimson and his firm, M. Rimson andamp; Co. &quot;Because of his lack ofexpertise, he construed activities he suggested {to thedefendants} as illegal that weren't illegal,&quot; Mr. Marks said.   FBI agent John Coffey posed as an upscale penny-stockpromoter named &quot;John O'Kelly&quot; who met with Mr. Rimson andother defendants in an alleged scheme to market shares of aworthless shell corporation, manipulate the stock and thendump it on the public before it crashed.   Mr. Rimson, who met with &quot;Mr. O'Kelly&quot; at a swank New Yorkrestaurant, recalls him as &quot;naive.&quot; &quot;He came across as a niceyoung pleasant chap who was trying to become involved in alower-end of the market where he had something to prove,&quot; Mr.Rimson said in an interview. &quot;But he seemed a little naive,&quot;said Mr. Rimson, who added that he's met with &quot;hundreds&quot; ofpromotors of low-priced stocks. &quot;We treat them with a grainof salt,&quot; he said.   Mr. Rimson added that he assumed Mr. O'Kelly's shellcorporation was legal: It had been properly registered withthe cooperation of the SEC.   Mr. Rimson, a 36-year veteran of low-priced stocks, wasone of several defendants who charged the government withoverzealousness in its policing of penny-stock fraud.&quot;They're trying to wash out the baby with the bathwater,&quot;said Mr. Rimson, who charged that legitimate small firms arebeing prevented from raising capital because of thegovernment's restrictions on low-priced stocks.   &quot;I'm still in a state of shock over the ordeal they put methrough,&quot; added Mr. Rimson, 65 years old, who's owned his ownfirm for 22 years. After the indictment, he said, brokers andcustomers abandoned the firm: he now has about nineemployees, down from 25, and the firm's net worth hasdwindled to about $400,000 from $1.3 million, he estimated.&quot;Now I have to pick up the pieces and see where to go fromhere,&quot; he said.   The other defendants who were acquitted were:   Joseph Christie, a Rimson trader; Sheldon Paul Prager,principal and owner of Sherman, Fitzpatrick andamp; Co., Mineola,N.Y.; Robin M. Rushing, former broker with Burnett, Grey andamp;Co., San Diego; Brent Gundersen, Salt Lake City, a privateinvestor; Sam Pandolfo, Denver, and his company, General Bondandamp; Share Co.; Preston S. Pandolfo, a broker with KoberFinancial Corp., Englewood, Colo.; Virgil M. Peterson, abroker with Alpine Securities Corp., Salt Lake City, and hisfirm, Alpine Securities; Vincent M. McGuire, broker withAlliance Securities, Salt Lake City; Victor Boykiw, formerpresident of the defunct Sterling Pacific Securities,Spokane, Wash., and Richard Sumrall, formerly with BiltmoreEquities andamp; Securities, Denver.</TEXT></DOC>
