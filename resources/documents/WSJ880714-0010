Take the subject of taxes. While the Washington political establishment has been saying for years that what this country needs is a good tax hike, the candidates out shaking hands in the shopping malls have been treating the idea like Superman handling kryptonite.    Michael Dukakis and George Bush may be willing to do triple reverse somersaults off the high bar to become President, but the one thing they clearly won't do is let someone get away with accusing them of using the T word.    The Vice President began the latest round of tax-dodging last week after Governor Dukakis decided to, er, enhance revenues to plug Massachusetts' growing budget deficit. &quot;I am not going to raise your taxes -- period,&quot; said Mr. Bush. &quot;He (Mr. Dukakis) has, in his home state, and he refuses to rule out a tax hike for the nation.&quot;    Nowadays those are apparently fightin' words even in Taxachusetts. The Governor shot back that Mr. Bush should talk, since the Vice President had endorsed the $6 billion in new taxes imposed on the elderly as part of Ronald Reagan's catastrophic health-insurance bill. Not to mention an additional $1 billion to pay for worker-training in the trade bill. &quot;So much for iron-clad no-tax commitments,&quot; said Mr. Dukakis, whose aides have fought Jesse Jackson's attempts to put a tax-increase pledge in the Democratic platform.    Whoa there, replied the Vice President. The catastrophic levies are really just &quot;a premium&quot; for insurance benefits, Mr. Bush said, not unlike the &quot;user fees&quot; that he had earlier said he might support. Besides, he added, &quot;What's a decision by President Reagan have to do with what I'll do as President?&quot;    Faster than you can say voodoo economics, Mr. Dukakis was back on the offensive. &quot;I understand he (Mr. Bush) had some difficulty distinguishing between certain kinds of taxes and other taxes,&quot; said the Governor. &quot;Back where I come from, if it looks like a duck, and it walks like a duck, and it quacks like a duck, it's a duck.&quot;    Then the Bush campaign lobbed another volley, trotting out Rep. Jack Kemp to say, &quot;If you're undertaxed, vote for Dukakis. If you're overtaxed . . . we want you in our party.&quot;    We suppose the voters will sort all this out, and if it keeps up, who knows, maybe even the political establishment will catch on too. In Washington, it's popular to lament that the candidates aren't being responsible, that they're &quot;painting themselves into a corner&quot; by promising not to raise taxes. The elite's current strategy is to have the National Economic Commission do an end run around the voters next year by endorsing a tax increase. But Mr. Bush won't even cooperate with that ruse, calling it the &quot;Cuomo tax-raising commission,&quot; after its intellectual parent, New York Governor Mario Cuomo.    It may be that Mr. Bush, and even Mr. Dukakis, remember what happened to Walter Mondale, Bruce Babbitt, Bob Dole and the other candidates who understood only too late the perils of the killer T word. </TEXT></DOC>
