Instead of creating an answering machine on a circuit boarddesigned to plug into a personal computer, what if we were to put a personalcomputer the size of a credit card inside an answering machine? Instead ofturning our personal computer into a facsimile machine, video editing system,or laboratory instrument by plugging in the appropriate circuit board, whatif we were to plug a personal-computer board into our fax machine, videoeditor or lab instruments?andM;We can imagine answering machines for the home that behave like thoseefficient but infuriating robot receptionists that seem to be turning up atso many corporate switchboards.andP;  &quot;You have reached the Doofus residence.andO;Press I to leave a message for Willard.andP;  Press 2 if you would like tointerrupt our dinner to solicit a donation.&quot;andM;Such automation is possible now, but not economic.andP;  The credit-card PCs,however - as an advance beyond the embedded controller - could be a source ofstandard, inexpensive, and easily programmed intelligence, providing theembedded market with greater economies of scale.andM;We note lately that fax machines are getting smarter.andP;  Seagate Technology haseven developed a tiny hard-disk drive to go in one for store-and-forwardapplications.andP;  Suppose AT-class intelligence were coupled with one of theSeagate drives and placed inside one of the new plain-paper laser facsimilemachines from Canon? Except for a keyboard and a display, the resultingmachine would include all the necessary elements for an electronic publishingsystem - scanner, printer, digitizer, and copier.andM;Although far less capable, our imaginary device is similar to the impressiveDocuTech publishing system recently introduced by Xerox, which useselectronics to accomplish the reduction, enlargement and image enhancementthat other companies do optically.andP;  And it reminds us of the intelligentcopiers that technologists have been dreaming about for a decade.andP;  It allseems closer now.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
