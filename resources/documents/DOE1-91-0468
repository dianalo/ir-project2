<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-91-0468 </DOCNO><TEXT>The high precision required for spectroscopic classification work hastraditionally been achieved through predictive systematizations of observeddata and computations by ab initio theoretical methods. Recent advancesin the existing experimental data base and in supercomputing capabilitiesnow permit these methods to be extended to new regimes. Through combinedparametric expositions of data and computations, large scale trends inisoelectronic, isoionic, isonuclear, and homologous sequences, Rydbergseries, etc., have emerged that permit predictions which are more reliablethan could be achieved by either ab initio or semiempirical methods separately.Applications of this approach to term splittings, which are particularlysensitive to the inner portion of the wave function, are presented.</TEXT></DOC>
