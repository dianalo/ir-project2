Investigators believe the explosive that shattered the Boeing 747on Dec. 21 was put aboard the aircraft in Frankfurt, where theflight began, Chief Superintendant John Orr said Thursday. Itapparently had been placed in the hold of aircraft as checkedbaggage.   ``New positive lines of inquiry are unfolding,'' he told a newsconference in this southwestern Scottish town where the jumbo jetcrashed, killing all 259 people on board and 11 on the ground.   ``While there is insufficient evidence at this stage to establishthe identity of the person or group responsible for this dreadfulcrime, the progress made and the evidence obtained has beensubstantial,'' said Orr, an investigator from Strathclyde police, aScottish regional police force.   Asked whether the investigation would point to a specificcountry, Orr said: ``It may.''   On Feb. 8, the Jerusalem Post reported the bomb that destroyedthe jet was hidden in a radio-cassette recorder and was traced toFrankfurt.   That report quoted unidentified investigators as saying thedevice was similar, but not identical, to one found earlier in thepossession of members of Ahmed Jibril's extremist Popular Front forthe Liberation of Palestine-General Command. The group has deniedinvolvement.   Orr said the brand name of the radio-cassette player had not beenestablished and would not say whether it was a pocket-sized deviceor a larger model. Nor did he say whether investigators had locatedthe detonator.   Anti-terrorist experts have said the explosive most likely usedwas Semtex, an odorless, highly malleable substance made inCzechoslovakia and known to be used by terrorist organizations.   Orr said he was ``aware of some aspects of the explosive that wasused'' but declined to elaborate.   The discovery of the bomb's hiding place followed painstakingreconstruction of a baggage container from pieces _ some no largerthan a table knife _ strewn over 40 miles of Scottish countryside.   ``The reconstruction of the baggage container suggests that theexplosive device may have been among the baggage from the Frankfurtflight,'' Orr said.   ``The particular bag which contained the device has not beenidentified at this stage, but there is the most detailed work underway with forensic assistance to achieve this identification. Ibelieve this can be done,'' he said.   Orr said the belief that Frankfurt was the origin of the bomb wasbased on ``a balance of probabilities.'' Most of the 1,500 pounds ofbaggage in the container in which the bomb was located was checkedin at Frankfurt, and the rest was ``interline'' baggage from otherpoints.   Flight 103 originated in Frankfurt on a Boeing 727. At London'sHeathrow Airport, the New York-bound flight was changed to a Boeing747.   A spokesman for the Frankfurt prosecutor's office, which iscoordinating the West German investigation into the crash, said ofOrr's statement on the Frankfurt connection: ``We have no knowledgeabout that.''   The most persistent claim of responsibility has come from ananonymous caller who has repeatedly told international news agenciesit was the work of the Guardians of the Islamic Revolution, anIranian group.   CBS News reported this month that Jibril was the principalarchitect of the bombing. Last month, the Hamburg newspaper Bildreported Jibril's organization was involved.   In Montreal, the 33-member council of the International CivilAviation Organization is meeting to discuss ways to better airlinesecurity in the wake of the bombing.   A draft resolution co-sponsored by Britain and the United Statescalls for improving technology of bomb-detection devices so they candetect plastic explosives.   The resolution questions whether computers, radios and otherelectronic devices should be allowed aboard aircraft since X-rayscanners cannot distinguish between concealed explosives andcomponents of the devices.</TEXT></DOC>
