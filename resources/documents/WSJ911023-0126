It isn't just that the Democrats who would be presidenttrail President Bush in the polls. They are also monthsbehind previous years' candidates in polishing their messagesand preparing themselves for the rigors of America's mostdemanding political challenge.</LP><TEXT>   Less than four months before the Feb. 18 New Hampshireprimary, which is likely to be the critical early test of thenomination struggle, it's clear that even the most advancedcampaigns aren't ready for prime time.   Campaigning in New Hampshire recently, Sen. Bob Kerrey ofNebraska wasn't prepared to address questions about theSeabrook nuclear power plant, the most contentious politicalissue in the state and one that sparks particularly strongpassions among Democratic activists. Gov. Bill Clinton ofArkansas, who has thought about running for president foryears, has been slow to assemble an experienced campaignteam. Sen. Tom Harkin of Iowa is running a strong, thematiccampaign but is prompting even some of his allies to worrythat voters may tire of his superheated rhetoric.   &quot;The only thing that makes it less daunting,&quot; says FrankGreer, a top adviser to Gov. Clinton, &quot;is that everybody isstarting out even.&quot;   Meanwhile, the candidates face the enormous task ofbuilding campaign structures, assembling ground forces forthe early political states, putting together delegate slatesand doing the tedious telephone and canvassing work that's soimportant in places like New Hampshire.   &quot;People are calling us up to try to help, and in almostany state -- including up here in New Hampshire -- there'salmost nothing they can do yet,&quot; says Sen. Kerrey, whosecampaign organization is as far along as any of theDemocrats.   Both the Gulf War and President Bush's popularitypostponed the start of the Democratic nomination struggle,and now that the field is assembled -- though Gov. MarioCuomo of New York and the Rev. Jesse Jackson may yet be lateentrants -- the candidates are confronting the vastness ofthe task. Former Vice President Walter Mondale, for example,raised $9 million and spent $10 million in 1983, the yearbefore the election. Rep. Richard Gephardt spent $5.2 millionbefore the 1988 election year even began.   &quot;If you took this to the Harvard School of Business, thiswould be the problem: Form a $5 million-to-$7 millioncorporation overnight in every state, under the publicscrutiny of four networks, the wire services and every majordaily newspaper in the country,&quot; says Mark Gearan, the firststaffer Michael Dukakis dispatched to Iowa. &quot;Your operatingbudget? You have to raise it. Your staff? You have to hireit. Your product? You have to perfect it.&quot;   The result is that these campaigns -- led by candidateswho are totally untested on the national level -- arescrambling to do several months' work in a matter of weeks.At the equivalent point in the 1988 election cycle, supporterlists were being generated and the contenders themselves hadbecome as familiar a part of the landscape as the mountainsand icy streams that form the backdrop for the primary.   &quot;There's one important thing: These candidates have to behere personally,&quot; says Steven McAuliffe, co-chairman of Sen.Joseph Biden's campaign here four years ago. &quot;They have to goto all the boring coffees with 15 people and they have toshake a lot of hands. The way you gain credibility here isdoing these thingsor at least doing them enough to give theimpression that you're doing them.&quot;   That's only just begun. This month, Mr. Harkin attended arally for striking textile workers in Whitefield, held acoffee gathering with activists in Berlin and mingled withactivists at a library in Plymouth. Both Mr. Kerrey andformer Sen. Paul Tsongas of Massachusetts popped about thestate, even making trips to Maine, which holds an earlycaucus. Gov. Clinton spoke to students in Littleton and to adowntown reception in Manchester.   But in these first forays into New Hampshire, thecandidates displayed their inexperience. News stories aboutSen. Kerrey and Gov. Clinton, for example, were driven asmuch by question-and-answer sessions with activists as byspeeches and events planned by the campaigns -- with theresult that neither was able to project a distinct message tovoters hungry for information.   &quot;There's an enormous amount of energy out there,&quot; saysCharles Campion, who organized Mr. Mondale's 1984 campaign inNew Hampshire and who is serving as an adviser to Sen.Kerrey. &quot;There are people who want to get involved, peoplewho want to come to rallies.&quot;   Now the candidates are rushing to build national and localstructures and are struggling to determine a game plan forthe primary season -- all at once. &quot;They're doing strategyand tactics at the same time, working out what they're sayingalong with deciding where they're competing,&quot; says CharlesBaker, who ran Mr. Dukakis's successful campaign effort inNew Hampshire in 1988.   Here in New Hampshire, the candidates are building whatDemocratic Rep. Dick Swett describes as &quot;organizations {that}are still fairly skeletal.&quot;   Mr. Harkin has attracted many of the most prominentDemocrats, an assembly of old-guard liberals and much of thecurrent party structure. Mr. Kerrey is deploying anorganization consisting heavily of local activists.   Mr. Clinton, former chairman of the moderate-leaningDemocratic Leadership Council, established an early presencewhen he came here to set up a local chapter of the group andsparred with Chris Spirou, the state party chairman. Mr.Tsongas is mounting a classic insurgency campaign, dependingon student labor. Gov. Douglas Wilder of Virginia, who spentmuch of the month in the Far East, has had scant exposure inthe state, with leading activists saying that they haven'thad as much as a phone call from the Wilder forces. FormerGov. Jerry Brown of California is no better established.   Unlike four years ago, when the candidates were derided asthe &quot;seven dwarfs,&quot; the contenders are receiving a warmwelcome here.   &quot;On the ground there's no `Stature Gap,' and no one caresthat Mario Cuomo's not in the race,&quot; says Ned Helms, formerstate party chairman. &quot;Mario Cuomo could turn up tomorrow andhe would find no one would race over and say: `Thank goodnessyou're here, it's been so lonely without you.'&quot;   Some party strategists, meanwhile, worry that the latestart may be a handicap for the Democratic contenders, whowon't be able to present as polished an alternative to Mr.Bush as they otherwise might have.   &quot;We all know it takes time to get your sea legs as anational candidate,&quot; says John Sasso, a Democratic strategistwho charted Mr. Dukakis's course to the nomination. &quot;This isa big country, and it takes a lot to know the people and theculture.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
