Rep. Philip R. Sharp, chairman of the House Energy and CommerceCommittee's energy and power subcommittee, wrote President Bush onWednesday that the nine states account for 52 percent of sulfurdioxide emissions, considered the leading cause of acid rain.   But Sharp said three congressional proposals introduced so farwould require the nine to achieve 77 percent of the nation'srequired reductions. The affected states are Ohio, Indiana,Missouri, Pennsylvania, Kentucky, Illinois, Tennessee, WestVirginia and Georgia.   Sharp, D-Ind., wrote Bush because the administration isdeveloping its own acid rain proposals, which could be submitted toCongress this month.   ``Nine states in the nation should not be cleaning up both theirown and somebody else's portion of the national reduction,'' Sharptold Bush in the letter.   Sharp said the proposed legislation would emphasize reduction ofsulfur dioxide emitted from older, coal-fired electric power plantsrather than from industrial facilities. The nine states, because oftheir geography, use coal-fired plants largely because they do nothave access to hydro-power and natural gas, Sharp said.   ``A pound of sulfur dioxide, removed from the air, is of equalbenefit to the environment whether it is removed from a smallindustrial facility in Texas or a large power plant in theMidwest,'' the letter said.   In the past, the Northeast, the primary victim of acid rain,sought immediate action while Midwestern states feared controls ontheir coal-fired plants would boost electric bills.   States that produce large amounts of high-sulfur coal _ Indiana,Illinois, Ohio, West Virginia and Pennsylvania _ worried thatcontrols would cause massive job losses in the coal industry.   The West, where low-sulfur coal is mined and acid rain is a lessserious problem, has been reluctant to pay the cost for newcontrols.   Acid rain is formed when sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide areconverted in the atmosphere into acids, which travel far from theirstarting points to pollute lakes and forests and, according tohealth experts, cause serious respiratory problems for asthmatics,children and the elderly.   The leading sources of sulfur dioxide are coal-burning powerplants and industrial facilities. Nitrogen oxides are emitted inapproximately equal amounts for asthmatics, children and theelderly.</TEXT></DOC>
