The second annual ``Safeguard Venice and the Great Wall'' artauction drew bids topping $540,000 for more than 80 paintings andpieces of art.   ``It was a good surprise,'' said Joel-Marie Millon, auctioneerfor the Paris-based auction house Drouot. He said proceeds from theauction were at least 30 percent higher than expected.   The auction of modern art was the highlight of the ``Return ofMarco Polo,'' a four-day luxury tour of Beijing that includes acaviar lunch on the Great Wall, banquets in the Forbidden City andwaltzes by the Beijing Central Opera.   Each guest paid $6,800, not including air fare, for the visit.   Daniel Vial, a Parisian public relations agent who has organizedthe tour the past two years, said about 100 people, mostly Europeanjetsetters, rich businessmen and auctioneers, joined this year'strip.   He said they had expected about 300, but many canceled becauseof recent pro-democracy student demonstrations that have convulsedthe Chinese capital.   Organizers said they did not yet know how much money would beleft after expenses, but Vial said it would not be as much as lastyear. In 1988, about $350,000 was donated to the United NationsEducational, Scientific and Cultural Organization to restore 2,624feet of the crumbling Great Wall and provide funds for the Basilicaof Saint Mark in Venice.   The highest price at Saturday's auction was for an acrylic ongalvanized steel by American artist Robert Rauschenberg, which wentfor $73,000 to New York decorator Tony Ingrao. Ingrao cast his bidby phone from New York, and other direct lines were open to biddersfrom Tokyo, Paris and Switzerland.   An ink painting by famed Chinese artist Li Keran went for$39,000, and an ink abstract by the daughter of China's seniorleader Deng Xiaoping, Deng Lin, sold for $12,000.   The few Chinese in the audience at the Museum of the ChineseRevolution watched in silence _ the average per capita income of aChinese worker is little more than $270 a year. But one Chinese mandressed in sandals and a polo shirt, Song Wei, won a hotlycontested bid to buy a Roy Lichtenstein color woodcut for $6,200.   ``He's a famous painter and no one in China has a work of his,''Song said.   Song, who said he is director of the ``Great Wall Museum ofArt,'' said he is Communist China's first collector of foreign art.He declined to reveal his source of income, but said he made hismoney in a ``normal'' way.</TEXT></DOC>
