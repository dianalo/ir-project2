Temperatures soared into the high 90s in several Midwest states, and past 100 degrees in some areas. Meteorologists said yesterday that they expect temperatures over much of the Farm Belt to exceed 100 degrees for the next several days.    The hot weather is hitting at the worst possible time for the already weakened corn crop. Much of the crop is at the peak of its pollination stage, which is when the plant is the most sensitive to extreme temperatures.    Agronomists said yesterday that the extreme temperatures are slashing corn yields by as much as 5% a day, on top of the damage that has already been done by one of the hottest and driest summers of the century. In Illinois, where nearly one-half of the corn crop has been lost to drought, state officials said yesterday that yields will now likely fall much lower.    &quot;It looks pretty tough,&quot; said Robert Hoeft, a University of Illinois agronomist.    The dry weather is helping to fuel the rise in temperatures. Normally, moisture in the ground helps soak heat from the sun through evaporation. The drought, however, has made the ground so dry that there's little evaporation. As a result, temperatures are higher than normal, said Joel Myers, president of Accu-Weather Inc., State College, Pa.    The corn contract for September delivery rose 15 cents a bushel to settle at $3.4125 a bushel. The soybean contract for August delivery rose 45 cents a bushel to settle at $9.595 a bushel.    Despite the hot weather, wheat-futures prices sank amid heavy selling by Richard J. Dennis, one of the most influential commodity traders at the Chicago Board of Trade. In recent years, Mr. Dennis is widely believed to have accumulated profits of $200 million through astute commodities trading.    Mr. Dennis's heavy selling surprised traders, who had expected wheat prices to rise yesterday in the wake of the move by the Agriculture Department to subsidize the sale of 800,000 metric tons of U.S. wheat to India.    Mr. Dennis's move was unusual, because he appeared in the pits to conduct the trading. Many traders said yesterday that Mr. Dennis hadn't waded into the pits for several years. Normally, he directs the trading of his firm, Candamp;D Commodities, from a small office upstairs at the exchange.    Trading pit sources said Mr. Dennis sold contracts for as much as 25 million bushels of wheat yesterday. Based on the board's preliminary estimate of trading activity yesterday, Mr. Dennis single-handedly accounted for roughly one-seventh of the wheat volume.    Mr. Dennis on Wednesday reportedly sold contracts for 15 million bushels of wheat, sources said. Mr. Dennis couldn't immediately be reached for comment yesterday.    The selling wave hit after the wheat contract for December delivery set a contract high of $4.31 a bushel. By the end of trading, the December contract had fallen to $4.02 a bushel, down nine cents a bushel from Wednesday's close.    Mr. Dennis's appearance on the floor always ignites widespread speculation about his motives. That is especially true this year, because his futures trading performance has been extremely spotty.    Last spring, two futures funds he started in 1987 were forced to suspend trading, as their losses totaled nearly 50% of their initial value. His personal losses paralleled those of the funds. But Mr. Dennis recently said that within six weeks of the funds' closing he had made back the losses in his personal accounts.    The fund customers weren't so lucky: What was left of their money invested with Mr. Dennis had been parked in Treasury securities, while Mr. Dennis worked to restructure the funds.    Traders said yesterday they weren't aware of Mr. Dennis's current financial situation.    ---   Scott McMurray contributed to this article. </TEXT></DOC>
