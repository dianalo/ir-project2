The agency has sold 52 thrifts since it was created eightmonths ago. But it now plans to sell or liquidate 140 in thenext 90 days.</LP><TEXT>   Agency officials say they can cut through bureaucratic redtape by using broad new guidelines that give buyers moreflexibility to decide which Sandamp;L investments to take over. Thenew policy will allow buyers to bid solely on the &quot;core&quot;institution -- consisting of a thrift's deposits andsecurities holdings.   The bidder may also bid separately on the Sandamp;Ls' riskierinvestments, or it may eschew those bad assets altogether.Those assets would remain with the government for later sale.The plan also gives the buyers up to 18 months, instead ofthe current six, to decide which assets to keep and which togive back to the thrift agency.   &quot;I think what they are doing is smart,&quot; says Clay Lebhar,managing director of the financial institutions group ofPrudential-Bache Capital Funding. &quot;All things considered, itshould increase the appetite for these troubled institutions.It's a plus to the process.&quot;   By isolating the bad assets, potential buyers won't haveto spend so much time and money on examining the thriftsbefore making a bid. Industry executives believe that willbroaden the field of bidders, and the thrift agency says itcould halve the time and manpower required for buyers toanalyze the thrifts.   For example, NCNB Corp. of Charlotte, N.C., dispatched afew dozen executives to University Savings Association inHouston, a $2.8 billion thrift saddled with bad real estateloans and a liquidity crunch. The team spent more than a weekreviewing loan files, computer systems, and the branchnetwork before compiling its bid and acquiring the thrift.NCNB was one of just four bidders, because few others werewilling to commit such manpower and money to an analysis,which might not lead to a winning bid. Other buyers have saidsuch analysis of a large institution might require sixmonths.   Frank Gentry, senior vice president of corporate strategyand planning of NCNB, says the bank, on the prowl for otherthrifts, could face more competition. &quot;I think you are goingto see more bidding because of&quot; the new policy, he said. &quot;TheRTC has learned from its bidding so far.&quot;   So far, sales by the thrift agency have ultimately leftthe government holding almost all the bad assets of thethrifts it sells, and the new strategy won't reduce thatliability at all. But some analysts believe the agency maywring more value from selling the core of the Sandamp;L franchisesquickly, before they diminish in value by languishing ingovernment hands for months.   &quot;They are trying to save the women and children at least,&quot;says Karen Shaw of the Institute for Strategy Development, aWashington research firm.   Moreover, the thrift agency just announced it will permitbanks buying Sandamp;Ls to retain the thrifts' branch networks,even if some state laws impose limitations on banks' buyingof branches. The agency contends it has the authority underthe Sandamp;L bailout and restructuring law passed last year. Sucha policy could attract more banks to the sick Sandamp;Ls.   A wave of swift sales would be a huge shot in the arm forthe agency, which has been thwarted by funding problems,political fights, and most important, a lack of buyers. Justyesterday, the White House acknowledged that the bailout planis likely to cost far more than its original $166 billionestimate over 10 years, but didn't specify how much more. TheGeneral Accounting Office currently puts that figure at $243billion.   Most recently, the bailout was on hold because ofconfusion over a court ruling that the nation's top thriftregulator hadn't been appointed to his post constitutionally.That ruling was effectively nullified when the Senate lastweek confirmed Timothy Ryan as director for the Office ofThrift Supervision. Mr. Ryan was sworn in yesterday. Aspokesman for the agency says several sales that were in thepipeline before the court ruling may be announced this week.   The agency, he said, has also begun marketing 87institutions -- those not targeted for liquidation -- inearnest. It sent to 1,000 prospective thrift buyersinformation about the thrifts, which include CenTrust Bank inMiami, where losses may exceed $2 billion, and 10 otherfailed thrifts with assets over $500 million.   It will hold seminars this month in Houston and Dallasoutlining how to bid for the Sandamp;Ls or their assets. The RTCalso recently entered into an agreement with the FederalDeposit Insurance Corp. to borrow whatever manpower is neededfor the 50 or so liquidations that are planned.   &quot;It may be ambitious, but we are hopeful that we can meetthese goals,&quot; says Sherwin Koopmans, who heads the marketingeffort for the thrift agency.</TEXT></DOC>
