(``Vons'') this proposed consent orderbecause the order is not sufficiently broad to resolve the potential anticompetitiveeffects of Vons' acquisition of the southern California stores of SSI Associates,L.P. (``Safeway''). Based on the information now available, the levelsof concentration, conditions of entry, and other facts that bear on thestate of competition in the supermarket industry in discrete southern Californiamarkets indicate that the Commission should reqire the divestiture of agreater number of stores to protect competition in markets in which Vonsand Safeway now compete. I would welcome comment on the scope of the divestitureprovision.<ITAG tagnum="84">Analysis to Aid Public Comment on Provisionally Accepted Consent Order</ITAG>The Federal Trade Commission has accepted for public comment from The VonsCompanies, Inc. and SSI Associates, L.P. an agreement containing consentorder. This agreement has been placed on the public record for thirty daysfor reception of comments from interested persons.Comments received during this period will become part of the public record.The Commission will review the agreement and comments received, and willdecide whether it should withdraw from the agreement or make final theagreement's order.The Commission's investigation of this matter concerns the proposed acquisitionby The Vons Companies, Inc. (``Vons'') of the capital stock of the SouthernCalifornia Division of Safeway Stores, Incorporated (``Safeway''). SSIAssociates, L.P. owns 96.4 percent of the voting securities of Safeway.Vons and Safeway are competitors in the operation of supermarkets in areasof Southern California and Nevada. Both Vons and Safeway also operate variouswarehouses and manufacturing facilities in support of their retail operations.Vons proposes to acquire 172 Safeway stores and attendant warehouse anddistribution facilities in southern California.The agreement containing consent order would, if issued by the Commission,settle the portions of the complaint that allege an anticompetitive effectin the retail sale of groceries by supermarkets in seven areas in California,including: Barstow; Yucca Valley; Santa Barbara, Montecito, and Goleta;Camarillo; South San Diego County; Santa Clarita; and Coachella Valley,including the cities of Palm Springs, Palm Desert, Cathedral City, Indio,Coachella, Rancho Mirage and La Quinta. The Commission has reason to believe that the acquisition would have ananticompetitive effect in the retail sale of groceries by supermarketsin the areas described above, and would violate section 7 of the ClaytonAct and Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, unless an effectiveremedy eliminates the anticompetitive effect. The Order accepted for public comment contains provisions requiring thedivestiture, in each of the areas described above, of either: (1) A storeor stores acquired by Vons from Safeway; or (2) a store or stores currentlyoperated by Vons. By the terms of the Order, Vons may divest stores eitherto any person or persons approved by the Commission, or to one of six differenteligible persons, including Ralph's Grocery Company, Albertson's, HughesMarkets, Inc., Big Bear Super Markets, Stater Bros. Markets, or CertifiedGrocers of California, Ltd. If a store is divested to one of the six eligiblepersons, there will be no separate comment period. If the store will besold to another purchaser, the thirty day comment period will apply.Vons and Safeway have agreed that they will not close the proposed acquisitionuntil a final Order is issued and the required divestitures have been made.If a final Order has not been issued within ninety days after the datethat the proposed agreement has been placed on the public record, the partieshave the option of closing the proposed transaction after giving the Commissionten days notice of their intent to close. The Order provides that if Vonsconsummates the acquisition before completing the required divestitures,or if the Commission brings any action against Vons under section 5(1)of the Federal Trade Commission Act for violation of the Order, or pursuantto any statute enforced by the Commission, Vons shall consent to the appointmentby either the Commission or a court of a trustee, who would have six additionalmonths to divest the acquired assets. After the initial six-month period,if the trustee is not able to find purchasers for the assets, the trusteewould have discretion, if the Commission finds it necessary, to sell anyother assets of Safeway that were acquired by Vons, up to and includingall of the assets of Safeway acquired by Vons, in order to effectuate asale of the stores in the seven areas described above. For a period of ten years from its effective date, the Order would prohibitVons from acquiring, without prior Commission approval: (1) Assets of orinterest in eleven or more retail grocery stores or any company operatingeleven or more retail grocery stores in Los Angeles or Orange Counties;(2) assets of or any interest in three or more retail grocery stores orany company operating three or more retail grocery stores in the city ofSan Bernardino; (3) assets of or any interest in three or more retail grocerystores or any company operating three or more retail grocery stores inthe city of Riverside; or (4) assets of or any interest in any retail grocerystore or any company operating a retail grocery store in numerous citiesand towns in California and Nevada where both Vons and Safeway currentlyoperate retail grocery stores. In addition, the Order would provide thatfor those areas in which prior approval is not required for the acquisitionof a specified limited number of stores in any twelve (12) month period,Vons must give thirty (30) days prior notice to the Commission. These areasare: (1) Los Angeles or Orange County; (2) the city of San Bernardino;or (3) the city of Riverside. It is anticipated that the provisions of this Order would resolve the competitiveproblems alleged in the complaint. The purpose of this analysis is to invitepublic comment concerning the consent Order, in order to aid the Commissionin its determination of whether it should make final the order containedin the agreement.<ITAG tagnum="6">Emily H.
