The Rulemaking</ITAG>Methods 15 and 16 are similar instrumental methods that are used for thedetermination of TRS. Since their promulgation with associated source regulationsin 1976 and 1978, innovations in equipment and testing have rendered portionsof the methods obsolete. Applied Technology Consultants, a major user ofMethods 15 and 16, requested that the Agency update the methods to includestate-of-the-art equipment and to increase the methods' flexibility. Additionalsuggestions made by Entropy Environmentalists, Inc. were also included.The resulting revisions will update the methods to reflect currently availableequipment and testing needs.This rulemaking does not impose emission measurement requirements beyondthose specified in the current regulations, nor does it change any emissionstandard. Rather, this rulemaking amends test procedures to which the affectedfacilities are already subject.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Administrative Requirements</ITAG>A. Public HearingA public hearing will be held, if requested, to discuss the proposed rulemakingin accordance with section 307(d)(5) of the Clean Air Act. Persons wishingto make oral presentations should contact EPA at the address given in the<T2>ADDRESSES</T2> section of this preamble. Oral presentations will belimited to 15 minutes each. Any member of the public may file a writtenstatement with EPA before, during, or within 30 days after the hearing.Written statements should be addressed to the Central Docket Section addressgiven in the <T2>ADDRESSES</T2> section of this preamble.A verbatim transcript of the hearing and written statements will be availablefor public inspection and copying during normal working hours at EPA'sCentral Docket Section in Washington, DC (see <T2>ADDRESSES</T2> section of this preamble).B. DocketThe docket is an organized and complete file of all the information submittedto or otherwise considered by EPA in the development of this proposed rulemaking.The principal purposes of the docket are to: (1) Allow interested partiesto identify and locate documents so that they can effectively participatein the rulemaking process, and (2) serve as the record in case of judicialreview except for interagency review materials (Section 307(d)(7)(A)).C. Office of Management and Budget ReviewExecutive Order 12291 Review. Under Executive Order 12291, EPA must judgewhether a regulation is ``major'' and, therefore, subject to the requirementof a regulatory impact analysis. This rulemaking would not result in anyof the adverse economic effects set forth in section 1 of the order asgrounds for finding a ``major rule.'' It will not have an annual effecton the economy of $100 million or more, nor will it result in a major increasein costs or prices. There will be no significant adverse effects on competition,employment, investment, productivity, innovation, or on the ability ofU.S.-based enterprises to compete with foreign-based enterprises in domesticor export markets. This rulemaking was submitted to the Office of Managementand Budget (OMB) for review as required by Executive Order 12291.D. Regulatory Flexibility Act CompliancePursuant to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 605(b), I hereby certify that thisattached rule, if promulgated, will not have any economic impact on smallentities because no additional costs will be incurred.This rule does not contain any information collection requirements subjectto OMB review under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, 44 U.S.C. 3501<T3>et seq.</T3><ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 60</ITAG>Air pollution control, Intergovernmental relations, Reporting and recordkeepingrequirements, Incorporation by reference, Kraft pulp mills, and Petroleumrefineries.<ITAG tagnum="21">Date: August 23, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Richard Wilson,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Acting Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation.</ITAG>It is proposed that Methods 15 and 16, Appendix A of 40 CFR Part 60 beamended as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 60_[AMENDED]</ITAG>1.
