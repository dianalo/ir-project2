White, Chief, RegulationsStaff, Compensation and Pension Service (211B), Veterans Benefits Administration,(202) 233-3005.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</T2> On pages 41644-46 of the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of November 18, 1986, the VA published proposedrules on the definition of fraud. Proposed changes to forfeiture regulationswere included. Interested persons were given until December 17, 1986, tosubmit comments on the proposed rules. Two comments were received on theproposed definition of fraud. As no comments were received on the proposedchanges to the forfeiture regulations, they were republished separatelyas final rules.One commenter stated that the proposed rule will make it easier to prosecutethose who blatantly provide false information to receive benefits for whichthey are not eligible. However, those who inadvertently fail to complywith required notification procedures, either through ignorance or an innocentmisunderstanding of the rules, must be protected from potential accusationsof fraud to the fullest extent possible.The other commenter correctly pointed out that the proof needed to showfraud for the purpose of forefeiture (mandated by law) is less than thatneeded to prove common-law fraud. Proof of intent to defraud is an elementof common-law fraud but no such intent must be proven in order to forfeitfor fraud. The VA General Counsel has held that with the exception of forfeiturefor fraud, it would be in appropriate to define fraud for the purposesof 38 CFR Part 3 other than with reference to its common-law meaning.The other commenter also stated that the effective date provisions of 38CFR 3.500(b) as to reduction or discontinuance of benefits were confusingas to whether or not they pertained to fraud. We disagree. Section 3.500(b)(1)pertains to the effective date of reduction or discontinuance of an erroneousaward based on an act of commission or omission by a payee or with thepayee's knowledge. This rule would apply whether or not the act of commissionor omission is determined to be an act of fraud for other than forfeiture.Both commenters stated the proposed rule should be in harmony with, notin conflict with, the regulations promulgating the Program Fraud CivilRemedies Act. This is not necessary as intent is specifically excludedas a requirement or criterion under the Program Fraud Civil Remedies Act.The proposed changes are based on an opinion of the VA General Counsel,Op. G. C. 4-85. In that opinion, the General Consel, citing the rules ofgeneral case law, held that the failure of a claimant to disclose couldamount to fraud and that such is an adjudicative determination. In makingthe adjudicative determination that failure to disclose is an act of fraud,the burden of proof rests with the VA.As this constitutes a major change from the initial proposed definitionof fraud, we are again publishing a proposed rule. This proposal defines``fraud'' as used in 38 U.S.C. 103, 110, and 359.The Secretary hereby certifies that these proposed regulatory amendmentswill not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number ofsmall entities as they are defined in the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5U.S.C. 601-612. The reason for this certification is that these amendmentswould not directly affect any small entities. Only VA beneficiaries couldbe directly affected. Therefore, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b), these proposedamendments are exempt from the initial and final regulatory flexibilityanalyses requirements of sections 603 and 604.In accordance with Executive Order 12291, Federal Regulation, the Secretaryhas determined that these proposed regulatory amendments are non-majorfor the following reasons:(1) They will not have an annual effect on the economy of $100 or more.(2) They will not cause a major increase in costs or prices.(3) They will not have significant adverse effects on competition, employment,investment, productivity, innovation, or on the ability of United States-basedenterprises to compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or exportmarkets.<ITAG tagnum="20">(The Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance Program numbers are 64.100through 64.110.)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 38 CFR Part 3</ITAG>Administrative practice and procedure, Claims, Handicapped, Health care,Pensions, Veterans.<ITAG tagnum="21">Approved: March 31, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Edward J.
