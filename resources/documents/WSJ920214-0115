The commission adopted rules requiring phone companies toreport outages that disrupt service to at least 50,000customers for 30 minutes or more. Phone companies have 90minutes from the time the outage is detected to send afacsimile report or hand-deliver one to the commission inWashington.</LP><TEXT>   But the commission didn't close the book on the issue. Theagency directed its new Network Reliability Council toexamine whether the thresholds are too high and whethertighter reporting requirements are needed for disruptions topublic safety or health communications, such as 911 serviceor airport communications.   The council, which consists of industry executives andphone customers, is expected to report back within 60 days.At that time, the FCC is likely to toughen the standardsbecause at least three of the commissioners expressedconcerns that the new rules don't go far enough.   Commissioner Ervin Duggan, who has been pushing forimproved network reliability for several months, expressedconcerns that the 50,000-customer standard &quot;will catch onlythe largest outages,&quot; and that it can be loweredsignificantly without becoming a burden for the FCC or theindustry. &quot;There is far more danger in knowing too littlethan in knowing too much,&quot; he warned.   The agency, Commissioner Duggan said, wouldn't have toinvestigate every report, but regulators, the phone industryand customers could use the data to &quot;gain the knowledge weall need to protect against further outages.&quot; He also said alower threshold for reporting disruptions that affect 911,airport and other emergency services &quot;may be vital to protectpublic health and safety.&quot; Commissioners Sherrie Marshall andAndrew Barrett also expressed concern that the interimstandards may be inadequate.   Network outages became a major problem last year asAmerican Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co. as well as several localphone companies experienced severe service disruptions.During the summer, Bell Atlantic Corp. and Pacific TelesisGroup had repeated failures tied to new network switchingsoftware. And an ATandamp;T outage last September disrupted airtraffic communications along the East Coast.   ATandamp;T said it supports a formal reporting program, butwarned that &quot;it could prove unworkable and unrealistic for along-distance company to establish the number of customersaffected by a network problem.&quot;   The commission has been under fire from Capitol Hill totake steps to make the nation's phone networks more reliable.To that end, the commission recently established itsreliability council, essentially a forum for carriers toshare information.   But many believe the FCC needs more concrete action. Mr.Duggan, for one, has recommended a thorough study to assessthe security and vulnerability of the nation'stelecommunications networks and establish a team within theFCC to investigate and try to prevent major failures.</TEXT></DOC>
