Schwartz </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><TEXT>   Ken, 24-year-old program trader for the Wall Street firm of Chances, Slim andamp; None, cringed when his private line rang.    &quot;Hello, Ken,&quot; the voice said. &quot;It's me, Barbie. How much have you made today spreading panic throughout the world's markets with your computer?&quot;    Barbie, 28-year-old equity trader at McChurner andamp; Co., called every day on her cellular phone to tally Ken's winnings.    &quot;I can't trade anymore,&quot; Ken said.    &quot;What's happened?&quot; Barbie gasped.    &quot;My circuit breaker popped. Following the Brady Commission report, the feds banned computerized program trading.&quot;    &quot;Oh my God, Ken, what will you do? What will I do? Who will be left to destroy the market?&quot;    &quot;I don't know. There's gotta be a way to buy and sell without a computer program or stock index future. Years ago, traders looked at something called a ticker tape, studied price trends, tracked chart patterns and read reports on companies' fundamentals. Then they made purchases or sales of individual securities.&quot;    &quot;They what?&quot; Barbie cried. &quot;What are those things? Oh, Ken. I'm scared. We'll be kicked out the Front-Runners' Club.&quot;    Next day, Ken sat and stared at the tape he had installed. &quot;What's the GM symbol for?&quot; he wondered. &quot;What's a dividend?&quot; he asked the firm's research analyst. &quot;Beats me,&quot; came the reply.    Ken needed a fix bad -- he ducked out to buy an index future from a shady French guy at the corner of Wall and Broad streets. On the way, a scruffy bum grabbed him by the sleeve: &quot;Hey buddy, can you spare an eighth for an option?&quot;    &quot;James Bondfund!&quot; Ken cried. &quot;What happened to you?&quot;    &quot;Fired. Circuit breaker popped. Been hustling counterfeit options.&quot;    Ken threw him a fiver and ran back in terror to his office. The phone was ringing: Barbie. &quot;A boyfriend who can't trade is like an executive without her Filofax,&quot; she said. &quot;Call me when your circuit breaker clicks back on. I'm going up to decorate Dave's cell.&quot;    Ken was suddenly afraid Barbie would return to her ex-boyfriend, Davey the Hedger, currently arbitraging license plates in the big house. With the firm he'd set up in his Manhattan penthouse, Davey had invested his clients' funds effectively -- to buy art for himself instead of stocks for his clients.    Ken called Evan Goodgreed at his duplex cell in The Breakers Correctional Institution in Palm Beach.    &quot;Kenny, baby! What do you like and where can I park it?&quot;    &quot;Evan, I need advice, fast. My circuit breaker popped. How did the old-timers trade before computers and futures, and options on futures and futures-indexed optional buy-back spreads?&quot;    &quot;Beats me. Never made an honest trade in my life. There must be a way, though. Ask Zircon Jim Brady.&quot;    Ken dialed Zircon Jim. &quot;Hello, Mr. Brady. Evan Goodgreed told me to call you and find out what to do with my stocks.&quot;    &quot;What's the problem, kid? Only two choices -- buy or sell.&quot;    Ken hung up the phone, fled his million-dollar Manhattan co-op, and returned to his family's working-class home in Queens. His father, a good union man, worked and struggled for his family on only $250,000 a year.    &quot;Pop, the government has banned program trading. I'll never trade again. Barbie will leave me.&quot;    &quot;Buy everything Ken. Buy now.&quot;    &quot;What are you saying Pop? You don't even have an M.B.A.&quot;    &quot;No Ken, but I've got my U.S.A., and I say, buy everything. I'm putting out the word at the union hall. Portfolio managers over age 30, widows, orphans and dentists will return to the market. The vital little guy will re-enter the mainstream.&quot;    &quot;But Pop, how will they buy stocks without portfolio insurance to protect them?&quot;    &quot;Watch this son.&quot; He grabbed the phone and dialed McChurner andamp; Co. &quot;Hello, this is Joe Citizen, a regular guy. Buy 10 shares of American Tel. andamp; Bill for my account.&quot;    Within minutes, Ken's dad received a verbal confirm.    &quot;But Pop, you forgot to sell an option or a future. You'll go broke.&quot;    &quot;No son, I don't want my circuit breaker to pop. I don't want to be greedy -- just rich. Greed is bad, rich is good.&quot;    Ken hustled back to Wall Street. Stepping over a small mound of lifeless bodies, he punched a button on his phone.    &quot;Buy 10,000 American Tel. andamp; Bill at the market.&quot;    As Ken's trade appeared on the tape, small orders from every corner pub, union hall and shopping mall all over America and the entire free world swamped the trading floor. Brokers returned to life. Volatility soon returned to normal and average volume scored new highs.    Ken, who returned home a hero and married his high-school sweetheart, Polly Esther, devoted the rest of his life to re-educating brokers the world over on how to trade without greed -- or a computer. Barbie married her art-throb, Davey the Hedger, and honeymooned in Allenwood for two to four. And Ken's dad started a middle-of-the-road lobby group called Arbitrage America.    ---   Mr. Schwartz, a New York investment practitioner and writer, has poked fun at Wall Street on this page before. </TEXT></DOC>
