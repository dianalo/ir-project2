While Washington reportedly planned to press Moscow over theinspection provisions of a future treaty, both sides have indicatedno change in their stands on other major oustanding issues.   The two new chief delegates, Richard Burt and Yuri Nazarkin,launched the 11th round of Geneva talks since March 1985 with ameeting at the U.S. mission.   After the 80-minute session, Burt told reporters he had outlined``President Bush's overall approach to arms control, emphasizing thepresident's commitment to reducing the risk of nuclear war.''   ``I hope we will make some progress,'' he said.   Nazarkin said, ``I'm satisfied. It was a good start.'' He saidMoscow may put forth new proposals ``in due time.'' He did notelaborate.   Burt, a military expert and former U.S. ambassador to WestGermany, replaced veteran arms negotiator Max Kampelman.   Nazarkin replaced Alexei Obukhov and had been chief Soviet envoyat the 40-nation Conference on Disarmament, which has been seekingfor years to complete a treaty banning chemical weapons worldwide.   Along with the Strategic Arms Reduction Talks, negotiators willresume talks on space and defense issues. Detailed negotiations aredue to begin Wednesday with a full meeting of both delegations atthe Soviet mission.   The session, expected to last six weeks, comes against thebackdrop of recent progress and superpower initiatives in talks onconventional disarmament in Europe.   Resumption of the talks was delayed by the Bush administration'sreview of national security policy during the Reagan presidency.   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Friday ``there willbe a considerable degree of continuity'' in the U.S. position, whilenot ruling out some adjustments.   One new element is a U.S. proposal for on-site trial inspectionsto monitor some cuts of long-range ballistic missiles alreadywritten into a draft treaty, Washington officials said. A Pentagonofficial said Bush wants to take advantage of the new Sovietopenness.   It would be the first time in superpower arms control thatverification begins during talks rather than once a treaty iscompleted.   But neither side has hinted at movement on disputes over thePentagon's space-based ``Star Wars'' missile defense, sea-launchedcruise missiles and mobile land-based missiles.   The Soviets say the U.S. missile shield, or Strategic DefenseInitiative, violates the 1972 superpower Anti-Ballistic Missiletreaty.   And disputes have developed over Moscow's demand for includingsea-based cruise missiles under the treaty and Washington's call fora ban on mobile missiles.   Admiral William J. Crowe Jr., chairman of the Joint Chiefs ofStaff, has predicted ``protracted and agonizing'' negotiations.   Much of a draft treaty to cut each side's long-range, orstrategic, nuclear forces by 30 to 50 percent has been agreed inprevious rounds.   START is intended to cover nuclear weapons with which thesuperpowers can strike each other, including those considered mostdangerous _ sea- and land-based ballistic missiles and heavy bombers.   Delegates are to begin the new session by reviewing agreementsalready contained in the 400-page draft text.   Among the agreements in earlier rounds are lowered ceilings of6,000 nuclear warheads and 1,600 delivery vehicles _ missiles andbombers _ for each side. Outlines of a system for monitoringcompliance were also set.</TEXT></DOC>
