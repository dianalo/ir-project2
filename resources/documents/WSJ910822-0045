The package includes 15 firm orders, 15 options, spareparts and support. The London carrier also said it plans tobuy up to 24 747-400 wide-body jets, bringing the totalpotential value of the transaction to $6.85 billion.</LP><TEXT>   General Electric Co., meanwhile, won a $1.4 billion orderto power the 777s with its new high-thrust GE-90 engine. Theselection shocked the aviation community, which had assumedthe nod would go to rival Rolls-Royce PLC, which has suppliedthe engines for almost all of British Air's large planes.&quot;It's a coup for GE,&quot; said Howard Rubel of C.J. Lawrence Inc.   The news caused Rolls Royce stock to fall sharply, whileGE and Boeing shares posted big gains. In trading on theLondon Stock Exchange, Rolls Royce shares fell to 139 pencefrom 150 pence. In late New York Stock Exchange tradingyesterday, General Electric was quoted at $72.875, up $2.375,while Boeing rose $2.375 to $48.25.   Separately, GE also announced that it agreed in principleto purchase British Air's engine overhaul business for about$450 million. Both GE and British Air spokesmen said the pactwasn't linked to the 777 engine decision. But analysts wereskeptical, saying the purchase price for the overhauloperation was heftier than otherwise would have been expectedand, in effect, sweetened the GE-90 bid.   For Boeing, the booking of the 777s was particularlywelcome news. The Seattle aircraft maker launched thetwin-engine plane late last year, quickly notching 49 firmorders. But since then, there has been just a handful of 777business. &quot;The 777 had indeed been stalled,&quot; said ScottHamilton, editor of the Commercial Aviation Report, whichtracks financial developments through the industry.   For British Air, the 777 order underscores a commitment toexpand and modernize its fleet. &quot;This decision represents amajor investment by British Airways in maintaining andimproving&quot; its position in the long-haul market, ChairmanLord King said in a statement. At the same time, the airlinealso ordered five 64-seat British Aerospace ATP planes, andtook options on six others, for short routes.   Many analysts have long expected British Air to step up asa 777 customer since the airline has bought strictly Boeingplanes in recent years, save for some McDonnell Douglas Corp.DC-10s and Airbus Industrie A-320s it inherited when itacquired British Caledonian Airways in 1988. Moreover,British Air was one of eight airlines that worked closelywith Boeing during the past five years to design the 777.   Still, British Airways officials said that intensenegotiations have been taking place with Airbus and McDonnellDouglas as well. &quot;Believe you me, it could have gone adifferent way right up to the last moment,&quot; said Don Craig, aBritish Air executive.   &quot;We've been fighting like hell,&quot; added Chris Longridge,vice president for sales at Boeing's commercial aircraftdivision.   British Air, which doesn't plan another major aircraftorder until after the turn of the century, will use the300-plus-seat 777s to replace its older DC-10 and LockheedL-1011 jets. The first five British Air 777s, which areslated to be delivered beginning in 1995, will be able to fly5,220 miles without refueling. Later models will have a rangeof 6,800 miles.   Boeing executives said they believe the adaptability ofthe 777's interior was one reason the plane was selected overthe McDonnell Douglas MD-11 and Airbus A340. Alan Mulally,vice president for engineering on the 777 program, saidBritish Air wants to be able to easily reconfigure itsjetliner cabins, changing the number of seats abreast and theclass arrangement.   &quot;It wasn't clear to them how the future would unfold, whattheir passengers would be willing to pay for,&quot; Mr. Mulallysaid. So the airline urged Boeing to design modularlavatories and gallies that can be pulled out andrepositioned during a routine, overnight maintenance stop.   Another apparent factor in Boeing's selection was itsability to use the 747-400 as a bargaining chip. By puttingthe jumbo jet on the table alongside the 777, the company wasable to make the pitch that it can fulfill several of BritishAir's needs at once. Such a combination also would giveBoeing more flexibility in arranging a payment schedule andreaching overall terms.   A spokesman for Airbus said the British Air sale showedthe government's support for the manufacturing consortiumdoesn't allow it to undercut competitors' prices or guaranteeit orders from European airlines. A McDonnell Douglasspokesman said his company was &quot;obviously disappointed&quot; theMD-11 wasn't picked.   Boeing played down any concern about winning more 777customers and said it anticipates at least one more 777 ordersoon, possibly by year end. Other airlines known to beinterested in the plane include Cathay Pacific, JapanAirlines, Delta and American. But the U.S. carriers, inparticular, may be inclined to delay making any big ordersuntil the airline industry recession plays out.   &quot;Other programs have gone like this, where you get one ortwo orders and then have to wait for another,&quot; said PhilCondit, executive vice president and general manager of the777 program. &quot;This is a longterm business.&quot;   For GE, however, there was no waiting for the launch ofthe GE-90. United Technologies Corp.'s Pratt andamp; Whitneydivision beat it out for an earlier United Airlines 777engine contract, and a loss this time would have set it backgreatly in an estimated $50 billion marketplace. The threeother 777 customers, Euralair, Thai Airlines and All Nippon,have yet to choose their engines.   A GE spokesman said the tentative purchase of BritishAir's engine-overhaul unit fits perfectly with plans toexpand a fast-growing part of its aerospace activities. &quot;Weview it as a wise investment,&quot; he said, adding that theservicing operation, based in Wales, would operate as theoverhaul center in Europe for GE-90 engines.   Nonetheless, C.J. Lawrence's Mr. Rubel noted that for $450million, GE will get in return a business with assets of onlyabout $170 million. That, he said, suggests GE used its deeppockets to swallow the overhaul business in return forBritish Air's pick of the GE-90. &quot;It shows they're willing togo to the mat to protect&quot; their new engine, he said.</TEXT></DOC>
