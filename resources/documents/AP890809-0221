MEARS</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   From the outset, President Bush said hisadministration would work patiently, persistently _ but probablynot very dramatically _ in the long, agonizing effort to gainfreedom for Americans held hostage in Lebanon.   That applies even in time of crisis. It fits the restrained,low-key approach the president and his lieutenants are taking inthe current situation, even toward the apparent killing of akidnapped American Marine.   There is no lack of anger, outrage and frustration at the WhiteHouse. But venting it with threats of retribution would do nothingto help the eight Americans still held captive of Shiite Moslemkidnappers.   Indeed, the dilemma confronting Bush, as it confronted hispredecessors, is that reaction, even retaliation, serves thepurposes of the terrorists who set out to create crisis in thefirst place.   The options are few anyhow. When he was vice president, Bushheaded an administration task force on terrorism which observed inits report that American principles do not permit randomretaliation.   Bush said he was outraged beyond words when the captors of Lt.Col. William R. Higgins claimed to have hanged him on July 31 inrevenge for the kidnapping of Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid, a Shiitecleric, by Israeli commandos.   The president's voice broke with emotion as he praised Higginson Monday, calling him ``one who stands as a symbol of the couragethat burns in the breast of every American in uniform. ...''   Hours later, the FBI said its experts had concluded that the manshown hanging in a videotape issued by the kidnappers probably wasHiggins, but did not say how or when he died. Higgins was takenhostage Feb. 17, 1988, while serving with a United Nationspeacekeeping unit.   Bush talked with Higgins' wife. He made no public statement onthe FBI report.   The administration says it is actively pursuing diplomaticefforts to gain release of the remaining American hostages. At thesame time, it has reinforced the U.S. fleet in the easternMediterranean. On Aug. 1, with Joseph Ciccipio under death threat,word was relayed to Tehran that if any more hostages were killed,the United States would hold Iran responsible.   But the White House has been purposefully vague about whataction might follow, saying only that there has been planning forevery option. So, too, on speculation about possible ways out.   ``There are a lot of ideas being floated, a lot of exchangesbeing made, but it's primarily a matter of talking and listeningand not signaling your moves,'' said White House press secretaryMarlin Fitzwater. ``We will be careful not to respond to every newdevelopment, new statement, new idea. ...'' He said there are goingto be a lot of them.   Fitzwater also said the administration does not expect a quickresolution of the hostage situation, which already is measured inyears.   Militant Moslem groups now hold at least 16 foreign hostages.The American held longest is Terry Anderson, now 41, chief MiddleEast correspondent of The Associated Press, seized in Beirut onMarch 16, 1985.   Before he was inaugurated, Bush said he would explore every paththat might point to freedom for the hostages. He said he couldforesee a day of better U.S. relations with Iran, and that it couldbe hastened by Iranian steps to ease the hostage situation. But hesaid he did not expect a swift, dramatic breakthrough.   Now his administration is trying to transform a crisis into asolution.   Offering advice is easier.   The Senate adopted one resolution saying Bush should determinewhether the United States can retaliate against the killers ofHiggins ``in a manner that would reduce the risk to Americans fromterrorism.'' Then it adopted another asking the CIA and thePentagon for a report by Sept. 1 on how best to locate and rescuethe remaining American hostages.   Neither is realistic but then, neither is binding.</TEXT><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE><TEXT>   Walter R.
