TRIMS. No pickup.</HEAD><DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Israeli troops shot and killed a guerrillatoday after he opened fire from the Jordanian side of the border,the army said. Two soldiers were slightly wounded, it said.   Jordan, in an official broadcast, suggested the attacker was adistraught Jordanian soldier who had abandoned his observation postat the border.   The attack occurred about 6:30 a.m. near the kibbutz, orcommunal settlement, of Hamadiya, the military command said.Hamadiya is 50 miles northeast of Jerusalem.   The Israeli army said one of its patrols near a border fence``encountered light weapons fire from east of the fence'' andreturned fire.   Soldiers searched the area after the firefight and found thebody of a guerrilla dressed in a military-type uniform and armedwith the U.S.-made, M-16 assault rifle, an army spokesman said.   The body was found on the Jordanian side of the border, he said.   Although the army identified the attacker as a guerrilla, thestate-run Jordan Radio quoted an official source as suggesting theattacker was a Jordanian army soldier.   ``An official source said today that at 6:30 a.m. the conscriptIssa Mahmoud Ahmad, carrying his gun, abandoned his observationpost at the border,'' the broadcast said.   ``During search operations for the absent conscript, the soundof shooting was heard in the Zor Abdullah area northwest of Waqqasvillage,'' it said. Waqqas is close to the site of the clash asgiven by the Israeli army.   The Jordanian official was quoted as saying Ahmad ``suffers frompsychological trouble...(and) is still absent.''   Israel radio gave a different version of the clash, saying thatan army scout was the first to open fire when he heard a noise onthe other side of the border. It said the scout was wounded in thefirefight.   It was the third infiltration attempt or attack from Jordansince May 1988.   ``We have an impression that this is not a new step or a newdirection,'' Maj. Gen. Amram Mitzna, the head of the army's centralcommand, told Israel radio in an interview from the site of theclash.   ``We see that the Jordanians are making every effort and use allthe means to keep this border secure and closed.''   In previous cases, Mitzna said, the guerrillas ``succeeded insneaking by the Jordanian patrols. This case is still unclear. Wedon't know who this man is, where he left from, who sent him andhow he came here.''   ``We should remember that although Jordan is really trying toprevent such activity, there is no substitute to our own forces,''Mitzna said.</TEXT></DOC>
