<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-59-0785 </DOCNO><TEXT>The general objective of this project is to develop a particulate controltechnology that can reliably remove particulate matter, with particlediameters from 0.01 to 10 {mu}m, from a flue gas stream with a removalefficiency of at least 99.9% for all particle sizes, independent of coaltype. The method involves injection of conditioning agents into the fluegas upstream of a baghouse to increase particle collection efficiencyand simultaneously reduce baghouse pressure drop. The conditioning agents,which have proven to be successful in achieving the goal of reduced fineparticulate emissions in preliminary tests, are ammonia (NH{sub 3}) andsulfur trioxide (SO{sub 3}). It is the goal of the proposed researchto develop this technology to the point where it is ready for field testingat the pilot level or compartment level at a full-scale utility powerplant. 1 fig.</TEXT></DOC>
