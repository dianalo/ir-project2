ChairmanL. William Seidman said Monday.   The agency eventually could control between $300 billion and$500 billion in failing thrifts' assets and sell off between $50billion and $100 billion in non-performing assets, such asrepossessed property, Seidman said.   The Bush administration has proposed creating the ResolutionTrust Corp. as part of its $157 billion Sandamp;L bailout plan, he said.   ``It (RTC) will be in the sole business of restructuring allthose Sandamp;Ls,'' Seidman told reporters before addressing the EconomicClub of Detroit. ``That means it will probably have to restructurethe institutions so the private sector can buy them.''   Taxpayers will pay most of the cost of the bailout plan, whichinvolves closing or merging more than 500 failed institutions.   ``What the government did was hand its credit card to a bunch ofinstitutions and said, `Here, you can borrow on our credit' _that's what deposit insurance is,'' he said. ``Now that the peoplewho lent them the money want the money back, the government eitherpays it or the deposit insurance system fails.   ``Since the government can't allow the deposit insurance systemto fail, the taxpayers will have to pay.''   Under the plan introduced in February, 219 insolvent Sandamp;Ls havebeen placed under FDIC conservatorship and another 60 have beentargeted for takeover by the agency, which will guaranteedepositors' assets.</TEXT></DOC>
