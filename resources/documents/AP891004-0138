On Tuesday, for the second time in a week, East Germany'sCommunist leaders agreed to safe passage to the West for thousandsof its citizens who had thronged West Germany's Embassy in Prague,the capital.   Later in the day, the leaders banned unrestricted travel intoCzechoslovakia in a desperate bid to stop the embarrassing exodus.   Fourteen buses carrying the East Germans from the embassycompound to Prague's Lieben train station left about 4:30 p.m.   The first train carrying 1,000 East Germans departed Pragueabout two hours later, reporters at the station said.   Fifteen trains were made available by the East German staterailroad for the transfer. The trains were to travel through EastGerman territory via Dresden to the West German border town of Hof.   The trains were originally scheduled to leave earlier today, butthey were repeatedly delayed. One report suggested that was becausewould-be emigres were jamming train stations along the route,hoping to join the mass transfer.   The Prague refugees waited through Tuesday night in nearfreezing weather, huddled in and around the embassy, many in tentson the embassy garden, which is roughly the size of a footballfield.   ``We couldn't survive a second night like this,'' said a RedCross official, who requested anonymity.   In Communist East Berlin, police scuffled today with 50 EastGermans attempting to gain entry to the U.S. Embassy, witnessessaid. Earlier, officials said 18 East Germans entered the embassyseeking passage to the West. Witnesses said about 100 East Germanpolice scuffled with the would-be refugees in front of the embassy.There were no reports of injuries. Witnesses said police alsocleared the area of 200 bystanders.   In Washington, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said ofthe situation at the U.S. Embassy: ``We're talking to the EastGermans about it and trying to get them to help resolve the problemthrough their emigration policies.''   Diplomatic sources also said that four East Germans were seekingasylum in the West German mission in East Berlin.   There were reports that thousands of would-be emigres in EastGermany were lining the route that trains carrying the refugeesfrom Czechoslovakia were to travel en route to West Germany.   Hungarian radio said the railroad station in Dresden, EastGermany, was jammed with hundreds of people hoping to jump aboardthe special trains but that East German police cleared the station.   However, in Frankfurt, the Hessische Rundfunk radio said youngEast Germans, their bags packed, had jammed other train stationsalong the route.   The radio quoted Bavarian border police as saying the massivenumbers in the stations were believed to be responsible for thedelay in getting the East German trains into Prague to pick uprefugees there.   East Germany agreed to have trains leaving Czechoslovkia passthrough East Germany before heading West, a face-saving measure forhard-line ally Czechoslovakia, which had vowed not to let the EastGermans cross its borders to the West.   In Bonn, a West German Foreign Ministry spokesman, Peter Rothen,said today: ``We have no reason to believe the (train) delay is dueto anything other than technical difficulties.''   However, a West German government spokesman, Hans Klein, said onZDF television today that the would-be emigres lining the trainroute could be a reason for the delay in picking up Prague refugees.   ``That would be a plausible reason _ that some people perhapswould have wanted to jump on the trains going by,'' he said. ``Thatwould be normal in the current situation.''   Meanwhile, more East Germans flooded the West German Embassy inWarsaw, Poland, bringing to 400 the number there who were demandingpassage to West Germany.   Many of them, their clothing still wet, said they swam riversand hid from police as they made their way to reform-minded Poland,hoping to join the historic flight from East Germany.   West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher said in aradio interview that he expected a solution for the refugees inPoland as well.   West Germany's mass-circulation Bild newspaper reported thatfour East Germans had fled to the West German Embassy in Sofia inCommunist Bulgaria.   East German leader Erich Honecker accused West Germany of tryingto ``destabilize'' his country by encouraging the exodus, which hasseverely drained its labor force of young, skilled workers.   The rejection of its Communist system is embarrassing EastGermany's leaders as they prepare to commemorate 40 years ofstatehood this weekend in ceremonies Soviet leader Mikhail S.Gorbachev is to attend.   Bild reported today that Gorbachev had pressured Honecker intoreaching a solution to the crisis. The newspaper, quoting nosources, said that ``Gorbachev let Honecker know he was willing tocome to the East German 40th anniversary celebrations only if therefugee problem were solved.''   East Berlin's curb on free travel effectively cuts off easyescape routes for East Germans, who also had reached the West viaHungary after that country's liberal leaders opened their westernborder in mid-September.   Hundreds of East Germans stormed through police lines andclimbed facades and rooftops to get inside the embassy compound onTuesday after crowding prompted West German officials to close itto more asylum-seekers.   It is the latest wave of an exodus that this year already hasseen more than 120,000 East Germans reached West Germany, wherethey are granted automatic citizenship.</TEXT></DOC>
