A contract dispute over the integration of flight attendants from the former Republic Airlines into Minneapolis-based Northwest Airlines has also erupted in a showdown as 7,100 flight attendants represented by the Teamsters will be legally permitted to strike the NWA Inc. unit after Feb. 26. In both cases, &quot;We'll bring 'em all down,&quot; Mr. Genoese declares.    Mr. Genoese's rabble-rousing histrionics have intimidated union members as well as airline executives. &quot;Genoese is smart and he's cagey; you never know what to expect,&quot; says an airline executive.    Since deregulation began in 1978, the Teamsters' overall membership has declined as airlines cut back on ground personnel and used more nonunion part-timers. At Pan Am, where membership shrank from more than 7,000 members to its current 4,300, Mr. Genoese is starting to meet real resistance. A Pan Am insider says Teamsters' members are split in their support of Mr. Genoese, whose core following is 1,200 members at Kennedy International Airport. &quot;The members don't want a strike; they want a deal,&quot; says the Pan Am insider.    Mr. Genoese was a member of the labor coalition of Pan Am pilots, flight attendants and flight engineers whose efforts in the past year led to the recent shake-up of Pan Am top management in exchange for labor concessions. But now that the Teamsters refuse to take the wage cuts that the other unions have agreed to, the other unions say their members aren't likely to support the Teamsters in a strike.    John J. Kerrigan, a vice president of the Transport Workers Union, which isn't part of the Pan Am labor coalition, has been especially harsh in his criticism of Mr. Genoese, referring to him as a &quot;self-proclaimed master negotiator.&quot;    Industry people feel that Pan Am, hurting from heavy losses and dwindling cash reserves, won't be too flexible in last-minute negotiations with the Teamsters -- especially since members of its other unions seem all too willing to cross Teamsters' picket lines. &quot;You can't get blood from a turnip, and you can't get a bigger turnip than Pan Am these days,&quot; says Louis Marckesano, an airline analyst at Janney Montgomery Scott, Philadelphia.    Mr. Marckesano recalls how labor demands backfired in 1986 at ailing Eastern Airlines, where some of the unions refused to give concessions to former Eastern Chairman Frank Borman. The stalemate allowed Eastern to be acquired by Texas Air Corp., where some employees still took heavy pay cuts. For the Eastern unions, &quot;Giving the concessions to Borman would have been a better alternative for Eastern than (Texas Air Chairman Frank) Lorenzo,&quot; Mr. Marckesano says.    But Mr. Genoese is undeterred. Already he is trying to bring economic pressures on Pan Am. In a union flier mailed recently to 30,000 travel agents, he warned them to &quot;expect a flood of complaints&quot; from Pan Am passengers who will face &quot;utter chaos&quot; if Pan Am is struck.    Mr. Genoese says the union isn't being unreasonable, noting it has agreed to grant Pan Am about $25 million in annual work-rule changes for three years. But the union refuses to swallow an 8% pay cut that Pan Am has also demanded. The Teamsters, stalled in contract talks with Pan Am since 1981, have missed out on raises totaling 21.6% that other unions have received over the years. &quot;If we agreed to take the cuts for three years, we'll go a total of 13 years without a raise,&quot; Mr. Genoese says.    The only other Pan Am union still in contract talks with Pan Am, the 4,800-member Transport Workers union, is waiting for the Teamster contract to be settled first. Mr. Kerrigan contends that Mr. Genoese blundered in allowing the Teamsters' contract talks to drag on for years instead of settling with Pan Am when the company was financially healthier. For the Teamsters' years without raises, Mr. Kerrigan said in a recent letter to Mr. Genoese, &quot;you and you alone are responsible.&quot;    Analysts say flight operations at Pan Am, which has begun interviewing and training strike replacements, would be affected minimally by a strike during the slow winter season. But, says an executive at another airline, &quot;Most travel agents are small mom-and-pop operations who won't see through this as a collective bargaining tactic, and that could hurt Pan Am.&quot;    Mr. Genoese says he will disclose more of his strategy this week. Mr. Genoese is being advised by Steven Hoffenberg, chairman of Towers Financial Corp., a small debt-collection and factoring firm that led a highly publicized campaign to take over Pan Am last year. Mr. Hoffenberg says he and Mr. Genoese will unveil a &quot;refinancing plan&quot; for Pan Am this week. </TEXT></DOC>
