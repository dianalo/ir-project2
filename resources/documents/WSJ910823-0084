On Wednesday, the U.S. Embassy released its annualpetroleum report, which was upbeat about the state of theindustry and the sentiment of foreign oil companies operatingin Indonesia. It said that companies have budgeted $2.27billion for exploration and development work this year, up80% from last year.</LP><TEXT>   Also, senior Indonesian officials told a regionalnatural-gas conference that efforts must be increased toensure the country can maintain essential exports. &quot;We haveto step up exploration,&quot; said Faisal Abda'oe, president ofthe state oil company, Pertamina. He said Indonesia, alreadythe world's biggest exporter of liquefied natural gas, aimsto increase its LNG exports 50% by the year 2010.   The U.S. report called gas Indonesia's &quot;future fuel,&quot;although both the report and Indonesian officials said gasneeds to play a bigger role now.   Indonesia's oil industry had a buoyant 1990, thanks to thePersian Gulf crisis, which caused a temporary surge inprices. The embassy report said crude oil production rose 4%last year and export earnings increased $1.25 billion, to$6.3 billion.   However, the report said, a surge in domestic energyconsumption, plus an increase in imports of oil thatIndonesia uses for some refined products, meant that thevolume of net oil exports declined 8%. Four years ago, thereport added, net exports were equal to two-thirds ofIndonesian production, but in 1990 they accounted forslightly more than 50%.   The minister of mining and energy, Ginandjar Kartasasmita,has regularly warned that Indonesia might become a netimporter of oil as early as 2000. The country's gas reservesoffer great possibilities for domestic use, but so far theyare being used mainly for LNG exports. Mr. Ginandjar told thegas conference that &quot;all of Southeast Asia may be a largepool of untapped natural gas.&quot; Domestic use of gas, he added,should be &quot;high on our priority list.&quot;   The annual U.S. report is the most comprehensive documentabout Indonesia's energy industry. The latest edition,covering 1990 and 1991's first half, chronicled continuingstrong improvements in the Indonesian industry that followedthe gloomy mid-1980s, when world oil prices and explorationplunged.   Thanks to strong prices in 1990, oil exploration reboundedworld-wide, the report said, &quot;but Indonesia attracted farmore than its share of the renewed interest.&quot; That reflecteda &quot;positive perception&quot; by companies of the country's oilpotential, economic growth and political climate andPertamina's &quot;aggressive effort&quot; in the late 1980s to open upnew areas for exploration, the embassy said.   At that time, Indonesia announced two incentive packagesthat &quot;sweetened slightly&quot; its contract terms, which&quot;generally are viewed as among the toughest in the world,&quot;the report said. &quot;Never has interest in Indonesian oilexploration been greater, at least from the standpoint of oilcompanies seeking new exploration contracts,&quot; the reportsaid. It said a record 100 blocks are under various forms ofproduction-sharing contracts, 57 of which have been signedsince 1987.   While a record number of companies are looking for oil andgas, the prospects of finding new large fields aren't strong,the report said. Because only three fields of 200 millionbarrels or more have been discovered since 1971, itcontinued, &quot;exploration must be continual if currentproduction levels are to be sustained into the next century.&quot;   The report said crude and condensate production isexpected to increase 10% this year, to about 1.7 millionbarrels a day. However, it added, the level could slip in1992 and 1993 &quot;if the large number of mature fields declinesat the rapid rate industry experts have predicted.&quot;   As for natural gas, one of the world's largest fields, inthe South China Sea, has been found in Indonesia but hasn'tbeen developed yet. Mr. Ginandjar said the Natuna field,discovered by a unit of Exxon Corp., needs to be developed toensure that Indonesia's plans to expand LNG production cansucceed. He said that technology has been developed to reducethe high carbon dioxide content found in the Natuna gas.   The Indonesian government has been negotiating with Exxonover how to develop the gas field, which has reserves of 45trillion cubic feet. Mr. Ginandjar would like Natuna gas tobe piped to multiple customers as part of a Southeast Asiangas grid, although he admitted that a grid is a &quot;dream&quot; thatwill take many years to develop.   At the gas conference, the Indonesian officials and otherspeakers said Asian consumption should grow strongly, in partbecause gas is better for the environment than oil andcontributes less to global warming.   Indonesia currently puts its proven and probable gasreserves at about 100 trillion cubic feet, and Mr. Ginandjarsaid the total eventually might reach 200 trillion cubicfeet. Pertamina's Mr. Abda'oe said the market for LNG andliquefied petroleum gas in Northeast Asia &quot;is so large thatit can't be covered by all the reserves we already have.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
