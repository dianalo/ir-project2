This is achieved by glueing theseparate batteries together into one unit, enclosed by at least one layerof glass fibre tissue impregnated with synthetic resin (if necessarywith a metal foil). The terminals are spared out, and the enclosure formsa through-shaped duct in which the control elements (thyristors, relays,etc.) are placed.</TEXT></DOC>
