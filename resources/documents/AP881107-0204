But the top officials, who ordinarily relegate security mattersto lower-level employees, may be disturbed to find how expensive andinconvenient it can be to make their computers less vulnerable to avirus attack.   ``I'm not sure there's a willingness to pay the check to do allthe things that would have to be done to really close down all theloopholes,'' said Steven Ross, senior manager for informationprotection services at the accounting and consulting firm ofDeloitte Haskins andamp; Sells.   Security consultants said they had received far more inquiriesthan usual since the end of last week. But they said computersecurity is a wide-ranging matter that cannot be solved simply byassigning passwords and installing some anti-viral software.   The attachment of computers into far-flung networks, a pervasivetrend of the 1980s, has made each individual computer far morevulnerable to penetration from an outsider.   Jon David, a computer security consultant in Tappan, N.Y., saidbusinesses that had contacted him for help seemed to underestimatethe challenge.   ``The amazing thing is, the attitude I'm getting is, `Why don'tyou stop by for a day or two and tell us how to protect ourselvesfrom viruses?''' he said.   Several consultants said last week's virus attack, which infected6,000 computers in the Arpanet research network, heightened theconsciousness of senior managers in a way that smaller previousattacks had not.   The virus clogged computers at universities and researchinstitutes by spreading from one computer to another by electronicmail and making repeated copies of itself. It did not damage anydata and was eventually erased.   ``The real culprit (in lax security) is management. Managementhas finally become aware of what can happen to them,'' said ThomasPrugh, executive vice president for science and technology atInformation Security International Inc. in Silver Spring, Md.   Prugh said computer security had probably been on a steadydowntrend since the 1950s, when each computer was isolated in alocked room and only a handful of people were able or permitted touse it.   Prugh said the downward trend in security probably reversedearlier this year, when awareness of the vulnerability of networkedcomputers began to grow.   But Prugh, and others, said there is a long way to go.   ``This was all very predictable well in advance. The problemstems not from fantastic genius but from fantastic stupidity,'' saidRoss, of Deloitte Haskins andamp; Sells.   Ross said he expected boards of directors to take note of thesecurity threats. But he said there were also signs of emergingcomplacency in some quarters.   ``The reaction already is that this is an isolated instance, thisis a boy genius, you can't prevent this, and besides, no harm wasdone,'' Ross said.   ``The only reason all the world's computers haven't crashed atthe same time is because they aren't yet networked together,''Lincoln D. Faurer, president of the Corporation for Open SystemsInternational, said in a recent speech. He said he intended theremark as a joke with a message.   ``We've got some pretty powerful tools. (But) we're not usingthose tools,'' said George Hertzberg, a specialist in computersecurity at Fairleigh Dickinson University in Rutherford, N.J.   The problem is that most kinds of security make things moretime-consuming and inconvenient for computer users, and the users'job evaluations are based on how productive they are, Hertzberg said.   ``When you try to implement any kind of control procedure, youare immediately confronted by those people who say, `Hey, I've got ajob to get done. You're slowing the system down. You're getting inthe way.''   Even kinds of security that would not slow down the users havenot been adequately pursued, according to a study last year based ona survey by Ernst andamp; Whinney of 400 data-processing professionals outof 1,200 at a computer security conference.   Nine percent of the respondents said they had lost $50,000 to $1million because of systems failures or downtime in the previousyear, while another 2 percent said their losses exceeded $1 million.Those losses were unrelated to security breaches.   But when asked about their contingency planning for failures ordowntime, 40 percent said it was irregular or non-existent, saidDavid R. Wilson, Ernst andamp; Whinney's national director of informationsystems consulting.   ``Every major corporation in the country, especially those thattie into open networks, are taking looks at their systems to see ifthey're vulnerable. And of course what they'll discover is that theyare vulnerable,'' Wilson said.</TEXT></DOC>
