The death toll brought to more than 300 the number of peopleknown to have been killed by three storms that have ravaged thePhilippines in two weeks.   Late Tuesday Skip was about 260 miles southwest of Manila and wasmoving west-northwest at 19 mph, the government weather service said.   Its peak winds had weakened to 88 mph, compared to 108 mph whenit came ashore Monday in the central island of Samar.   The storm's center moved across the islands about 100 miles southof Manila, sparing the capital much damage.   But the Office of Civil Defense reported seven people drowned infloods in the Manila suburb of Pasig.   The Social Services Department reported at least 1 million peoplewere affected by the typhoon, meaning their homes or property weredestroyed or damaged. The Office of Civil Defense said more than30,000 people were homeless.   Red Cross officials said 36 people were killed on Palawan, whereSkip triggered widespread flooding on the southern part of theremote island.   The Red Cross said the next hardest-hit area was Camarines Surprovince on the southeastern edge of Luzon island, where 19 peoplewere killed in landslides and a tornado triggered by the typhoon.   The other deaths reported were seven drownings on Panay Island, aperson electrocuted by a downed power line, and three drownings onMarinduque Island and in Agusan del Norte province.   Casualty reports from Philippine relief agencies often conflictbecause of differences in reporting and in standards for accountingfor deaths. The Red Cross reports casualties only if they canidentify the victims by name.   The overall death toll of 73 included seven in Manila's Pasigsuburb and eight on Panay island which were reported by thegovernment Office of Civil Defense but not by the Red Cross.   Typhoon Ruby struck the Philippines on Oct. 24 and Tropical StormTess swept through the Visayas Islands on Saturday.   Officials said Typhoon Ruby killed at least 181 people on landand at least 64 others perished and more than 200 are missing fromthe passenger ship Dona Marilyn that sank. They said the tropicalstorm caused floods that killed 11 people.</TEXT></DOC>
