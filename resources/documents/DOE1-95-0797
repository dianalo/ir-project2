These processes usually employ a moltensalt or salt eutectic as a heat sink and/or reaction medium. Salts forthese operations were selected early in the development cycle. The selectioncriteria are being reevaluated. In this article, the authors describethe processes now in use at Los Alamos and their studies of alternatesalts and eutectics.</TEXT></DOC>
