The whipsawing price action comes amid heightened nervousness in worldwide oil markets -- and as oil companies begin to question their internal price projections. But the late rally showed that leading spokesmen for the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries still have the power to arrest severe price declines.    On the New York Mercantile Exchange, West Texas Intermediate crude oil for October delivery was down by more than 40 cents a barrel but rebounded in the last hour of trading in a burst of panic buying, closing up 31 cents at $14.49 a barrel. Earlier in the day, prices for North Sea Brent fell by 65 cents to 70 cents a barrel on European spot markets, with some cargoes trading below $13 a barrel.    More significantly, several oil refiners, led by Sun Co., reduced their field postings for West Texas Intermediate by 75 cents a barrel to $13.25 -- the lowest level since August 1986. It was the third cut this month in the price that refiners pay for the U.S. benchmark crude.    Then yesterday afternoon -- just as some oil analysts and traders were raising anew the spectre of a repeat of the 1986 oil-price crash -- the two leading OPEC members saved the market, issuing calls for measures to halt the price deterioration.    Venezuela led off, with Julio Cesar Gil, the new oil minister, confirming that he has called for a meeting of OPEC's price-monitoring committee before the full cartel conference scheduled for Nov. 21. &quot;The situation in the international markets is worrying because crude prices have reached a critical point,&quot; Mr. Gil said at a news conference in Caracas.    Indeed, some U.S. oil industry executives think oil prices would already be much lower except for the continuing speculation over a meeting of the five-member price-monitoring committee -- perhaps as low as $12. &quot;Fundamentally, that's where it would be if it weren't for the expectation there might be a meeting of the OPEC price committee,&quot; said Bob Mehall, group vice president-supply for Diamond Shamrock Randamp;M Inc., a San Antonio, Texas, refiner whose gross margin has doubled to about $4 a barrel from a year ago.    The Venezuelan official's comments about a price-committee meeting were quickly followed by a statement from the king of Saudi Arabia, which is also a member of the price committee but reportedly has previously opposed a meeting.    &quot;King Fahd expressed hope that OPEC and non-OPEC oil-producer countries would take {the} initiative to control the matter before {further} deterioration in the markets,&quot; the Saudi Press Agency reported.    The Saudi statement also said Hisham Nazer, the oil minister, described as &quot;untrue&quot; reports that oil prices were falling because Saudi Arabia was refusing to convene a price-committee meeting. On the contrary, the agency quoted Mr. Nazer as saying, Saudi Arabia &quot;is always the first to take the initative to . . . any meeting agreed upon by OPEC members.&quot;    The effect of the Saudi statement was reminiscent of the 1986 price crash, when King Fahd twice made statements to support the oil market when prices dipped below $10 a barrel. This time, said Paul Mlotok, international oil analyst at Salomon Brothers Inc., &quot;Fahd is saying enough is enough, and this could be the critical statement&quot; which will stay the price decline.    Later yesterday, Rilwanu Lukman, OPEC president and Nigeria's oil minister, weighed in with a statement of his own, warning that unless the members support the cartel, oil prices could fall as low as $9 a barrel.    But prices may not have to get that low. &quot;This may be a bottom,&quot; said Scott Jones, president of AUS Consultants' Industry Analysis Group, Philadelphia. Mr. Jones, formerly an oil-price forecaster for Atlantic Richfield Co., said, &quot;We expect OPEC has pretty much peaked out in terms of production.&quot; OPEC output recently surged to 20 million barrels a day, a high for the year.    Mr. Jones said oil markets are in the process of &quot;rebenchmarking,&quot; with the benchmark price now in a range of $14 to $15 a barrel range instead of a $15 to $18 range. In fact, Mr. Jones said the major oil companies have been quarreling internally all year as to whether they should base budgets on $12 oil or $15 oil. Most companies earlier had said they were basing 1988 budgets on a $15 to $18 range.    ---   Allana Sullivan contributed to this article. </TEXT></DOC>
