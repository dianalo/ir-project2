YangStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 01/09/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> EUROP GOVMTBANKS, THRIFT INSTITUTIONS (BNK)FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD (FED)TREASURY DEPARTMENT (TRE) </IN><DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Bank regulators in the U.S. and Britain proposed a joint regulation linking banks' capital reserves to the risk involved in their investments.    The proposal, issued yesterday by the Federal Reserve Board and the Bank of England, represents a major step toward coordinating bank regulation among major financial powers around the world. The U.S. Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. will propose the same rule for the institutions they regulate.    Fed Chairman Paul Volcker called the agreement &quot;a breakthrough . . . a step toward international consistency.&quot; The uniform rules would &quot;minimize the distortion in international competition,&quot; said another Fed official.    In London, Robin Leigh-Pemberton, governor of the Bank of England, said the proposals &quot;represent a landmark in international supervisory cooperation.&quot; Regulators in the two countries &quot;were under pressure to introduce as level a playing field as possible in the globalized financial scene,&quot; he said.    The proposed rule, which represented a slight modification from one proposed by the Fed a year ago, would require banks to keep more capital on hand if their practices are riskier than typical investments and loan portfolios.    Currently, U.S. banks are required to maintain capital reserves equal to at least 6% of their assets, no matter what their nature. British bank regulators have used risk-based requirements for about the past five years.    The proposal would also increase the kind of items that are included when calculating a bank's assets. These include standby letters of credit for corporations and overdraft facilities, which generally aren't included on a bank's balance sheet. Regulators fear that if these standby commitments are drawn on all at once, a funding crisis could result.    The regulators proposed a formula for weighting the risks of various assets but didn't specify the minimum ratio of capital to assets they will require. That figure will be determined after the 90-day period for public comment, Fed officials said.    The proposal would affect only the 50 largest banks in the U.S., the officials said.    Those large U.S. banks with significant overseas operations had complained that the Fed's original proposal would have placed them at a competitive disadvantage by increasing their capital requirements for various assets, including interest-rate and currency swaps arranged by U.S. and British banks.    Such transactions typically enable borrowers as well as investors to exchange fixed-rate obligations for floating-rate obligations or obligations in one currency for those in another. These transactions have become an essential part of the international capital market, mushrooming during the past five years to more than $200 billion from only a few billion in 1981.    &quot;It addressed areas where U.S. banks have to compete directly with investment banks and European banks,&quot; said Washington bank consultant Karen Shaw. &quot;To slap capital requirements on U.S. banks . . . would have disadvantaged U.S. banks only.&quot;    U.S. bankers welcomed the Anglo-American agreement. &quot;Any move in allying (U.S.) banks' capital with foreign banks' is a step in the right direction,&quot; said American Bankers Association spokesman Kirk Willison.    Mr. Leigh-Pemberton said he hoped the joint proposal &quot;will provide a basis which other countries, notably Japan . . . can follow.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
