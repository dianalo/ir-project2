Commentswere solicited prior to publication of the final rule. As a result of thecomments received, certain changes have been made. These changes, as wellas certain technical clarifications which have arisen as a result of thecomments received and application of the rule since September 23, are discussedin the supplementary information.The basic structure of the interim final rule has been retained. Two testsare applied to each flood control project in order to determine whethera project qualifies for a reduction in the non-Federal cost-share. Thebenefits test sets an alternative cost-sharing floor whenever one fourthof the benefit-cost ratio, expressed as a percentage, is less than thestandard cost-share as defined in the applicable portion of section 103of Public Law 99-662, 33 U.S.C. 2213. To be eligible for any cost-sharereduction that would result from application of the benefits test, a projectmust also have an Eligibility Factor that exceeds zero. The EligibilityFactor is determined by the income test which compares the income of peoplein the project area (as measured by the county) and state to the nationalaverage. If the county and state per capita income values are low, projectswith an alternative non-Federal cost-share established by the benefitstest will be eligible for a reduction.There are three major changes to the interim final rule. First, the incometest has been modified by giving less weight to state per capita personalincome (PCI) and more weight to the income of the project area (as representedby county PCI). Second, when the income test yields an Eligibility Factorwhich is greater than zero, we are permitting deferred payments for a portionof the non-Federal share by non-Federal parties regardless of the outcomeof the benefits test. Third, when a Native American tribe or village isthe local sponsor, the Eligibility Factor is based on income data for thetribe or village only.<ITAG tagnum="84">Background</ITAG>There were 11 responses to the interim final rule. Some concentrated ona single point, others brought up a number of concerns. Each point raisedby the commenters is addressed in the discussion that follows.In our previously published discussion of September 23, 1987, on interpretationof section 103(m), we argued that the language was broad and that therewas no definite Congressional direction on how the Secretary is to proceed.We concluded that every flood control project should retain at least afive percent non-Federal share. Several commenters disagreed, expressingthe view that the Secretary should grant exemptions to non-Federal cost-sharingin the most extreme economic circumstances. In two letters, it was pointedout that Rep. Roe was asked specifically about the projects authorizedby section 202 of Public Law 96-367, 94 Stat. 1339. In his response, Rep.Roe stated that ``It is the committee's view that improverished areas suchas those affected by the Section 202 projects should be exempted from thecost sharing provisions of the bill pursuant to the Secretary's authority.''(p. H11567). A third commenter also pointed to Rep. Roe's remarks in supportingthe review that exemptions from cost sharing be generally considered. Weacknowledged in our previous discussion that Rep. Roe expressed his viewthat the Secretary should be encouraged to provide new flood control protectionat reduced or no non-Federal cost-sharing. We also found evidence of theopposite position, as taken by Sen. Stafford: ``It is anticipated thatthe Secretary will only rarely invoke this authority. And this provisioncan never be used to eliminate the non-Federal share.'' (p. S16983).Both Rep. Roe and Sen. Stafford were quoted in order to show the wide rangeof opinions that Congress had towards this provision. We continue to believethat we can retain non-Federal cost-sharing requirements for all floodcontrol projects, without damaging the underlying purpose of section 103(m).Furthermore, our policy is constructive in maintaining the integrity ofthe cost-sharing philosophy which would be damaged by wider divergencesin the non-Federal share. We have consistently opposed cost-sharing exemptionsand Congress has generally held the same view, making only a small numberof exemptions in Pub. L. 99-662 (Barbourville and Harlan KY were the onlytwo section 202 projects exempted). Given this background, we will retainour requirement that at least five percent of the project be a non-Federalshare.<ITAG tagnum="84">The Role of the Local Sponsor</ITAG>The interim final rule was premised in part on our view that the stateshould have a responsibility to participate in project financing when alocal sponsor's financing options are limited. In the comments received,there was some disagreement on this point. One commenter saw no role forstate government: ``until Congressional intent is clearly established,the COE should follow existing Federal policy on this issue, i.e., Federalresponsibility remains with the involved federal agency for water projectcosts over and above the local sponsor's contribution.'' Others stressedthe importance of the local sponsor below the state level in planning andfinancing decisions citing political, legal, and other institutional constraintswhich limit state participation. The opposite extreme was also expressed,``if the Corps insists that `* * * states have a responsibility in caseswhere the local sponsor seems incapable of providing the non-Federal share.',then perhaps it is incumbent upon only the states to contract for theseprojects.''We do not want to exclude consideration of state resources as a sourceof financing. There is no basis for the assertion that state participationis against Federal policy. This is abundantly clear from the various arrangementsstates have made for providing state support for such projects. In somecases, when state constraints present a problem, we believe it is incumbenton state and local Governments to address these problems directly, ratherthan seek additional Federal support. At the same time, we do not feelit is appropriate to insist that states be solely responsible, or attemptto define with any precision, the degree to state involvement in individualcases. In many cases that state and local governments have preferred touse the smaller jurisdiction as the source of financing.Our formula therefore continues to include state income as a factor inthe analysis. In response to the concerns expressed in the comments, wehave however, changed the weights given to state and local incomes so thatthe local income is now given twice the weight of the state.<ITAG tagnum="84">The Use of Project Benefits in Developing a Cost-Share Alternative</ITAG>We argued previously that ``local sponsors and their states have two sourcesof economic resources that can be used to pay for the non-Federal shareof the project. First, existing resources as reflected in traditional measuresof income and/or wealth, may be sufficient. Second the project itself willgenerate benefits.Many of the benefits to flood control projects are either due to flooddamage reduction or to income enhancement to households and businesseslocated in the project area. These benefits represent an important sourceof income and wealth that will be available for project funding no matterhow poor the project area is before implementation.''Several commenters disagreed with our use of project benefits to definethe limits of cost-share reductions. They expressed the view that benefitsdo not represent the ``real dollars'' needed for project financing andthat the ``approach favors projects with less merit and discriminates againstthose projects that provide the greater <T3>National</T3> benefits.'' We remain convinced that the resources saved(i.e. the National benefits) by a flood control project can legitimatelybe used in an ability to pay evaluation and that this will not in any wayfavor low benefit projects over those with high benefits. The Federal policy,which gives the highest priority to projects with a high benefit/cost ratio,will be unaffected. Communities will still prefer projects with high benefit/costratios, because the extra benefits received will be greater than the additonalnon-federal costs that might be incurred after application of the abilityto pay rule.We will therefore, continue to use project benefits to determine the alternativelevel of cost-sharing under the ability to pay test. This alternative levelestablishes a benefits based floor (BBF) below which the non-Federal cost-sharewill not be reduced. When projects are fully eligible based on the incometest describe below, the reduction in the non-Federal share will be suchas to set the share equal to one fourth of the project's benefit/cost ratio,when this ratio is expressed as a percentage. For example, if a projecthas a benefit/cost ratio of 1.2, share reductions cannot bring the sharebelow one fourth of this, or 30 percent of project first costs. In thisexample, if the ``stardard'' level of cost-sharing, i.e. the amount requiredby section 103(a) or 103(b), 33 U.S.C. 2213, a and b, is less than 30 percent,there will be no reduction under the ability to pay provision.We are, however, modifying our interim rule by allowing that for projectswith an Eligibility Factor greater than zero, a portion of the non-Federalshare may be deferred even if the BBF exceeds the standard non-Federalcost-share. We require for structural projects, that the local sponsorprovide during construction, cash payments equal to five percent of totalproject costs, and to contribute lands, easements, rights of way, relocations,and dredged material disposal areas (LERRD) paid for or acquired by thelocal sponsor prior to signing a cost-sharing agreement. The remainingnon-Federal share, either for LERRD or for cash requirements in excessof 5 percent of project costs, can be deferred. For non-structural projects,we require during construction LERRD paid for or acquired by the localsponsor prior to the agreement with the remainder eligible for deferment.By permitting deferred payments when the Eligibility Factor exceeds zero,we are more closely matching the non-Federal payment requirement to thebenefits stream for projects in low income areas. In those areas with thegreatest possible cost-share reductions (Eligibility Factor equals or exceedsone), payments during construction and repayments of deferred amounts needbe no greater than one fourth of project benefits. We do not believe thisrepresents a hardship.As in the interim rule, any reductions in non-Federal shares under theability to pay provision will apply to first costs only. For administrativesimplicity, we will use one fourth of the benefit-cost ratio as an alternativeshare, even though the costs in this calculation include Oandamp;M costs.This ratio will be calculated based on the discount rate which the Corpsis using to evaluate projects at the time the local cooperation agreement(LCA) is signed. For LCA's signed in 1989 for example, an 8.875 percentdiscount rate would be used.<ITAG tagnum="85">The Use of Per Capita Personal Income To Determine Project Eligibility</ITAG>The final rule continues to determine project eligibility for reductionsin the non-Federal share by using the per capita personal income of theproject area (using county income as the surrogate for project area income)and the state in which the project is located. In developing the interimfinal and final rule, two of our guiding principles have been: (a) Thatthe rule should not be any more complex than is necessary; and (b) thatit should be based on easily accessible, publicly available data. We concludedthat a standard measure of income would be the appropriate statistic touse. Several comments were directed towards our approach.One observation was made that since local or county government taxes arestructure-based rather than income-based, household income, rather thanper capita personal income would be a better measure to use. There arethree sources of income data available from the Federal Government whichmight be used to measure the underlying resource base  of political subdivisionsbelow the state level. First is per capita personal income (PCI), publishedyearly for each county, by the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA). Secondis per capita money income available biannually for counties and incorporated(sub-county) places, published by the Bureau of the Census. Third is medianfamily income (MFI), available yearly for each county, from data publishedby the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). The HUD estimatesare more up to date (HUD currently has estimates for 1988, while the BEAdata are currently available only through 1986), but are based in parton projections of previous years' data using other economic factors asthe basis of the projections.We continue to feel that data should be available on a yearly basis andthat a three-year average should be used in the calculation of the EligiblityFactor. This limits our choice to per capita personal income and medianfamily income. There are a number of reasons for differences in the measuresof PCI and MFI. Perhaps the most significant is that PCI is a measure ofthe mean, while MFI is a measure of the median. This is relevant to ourchoice of income variable. The revenue potential from a structure-basedtax is more closely related to the total value of the structures (and thereforeto the mean) than to the median value. It allows that if income is beingused as a proxy for wealth to measure a local government's revenue potential,the mean is a more appropriate measure than the median, even if a localgovernment raises revenues by using a structured-based tax. Thus we havedecided to stay with PCI in our eligibility formula.Two commenters pointed out that the local sponsor may be an entity whichis smaller than the county level, so that county income does not necessarilyrepresent the income of the residents under the sponsor's jurisdiction.As pointed out above, this information is not available on a yearly basis.Even if it were available, we do not feel it necessary or desirable tomatch the income estimate precisely to the project sponsor's jurisdiction,since sponsors vary from project to project.One disagreed with our ``formula approach'', stating that it would be preferableto have the Secretary apply judgment to each project rather than rely ona ``simplistic and unsophisticated formula''. We believe that a formulaapproach is far preferable to a case by case analysis. It is importantthat any rule be capable of being applied consistently and objectivelythroughout the nation. This requires that specific factors be identifiedand that the consequences of these factors be the same in all ability topay tests. By keeping the formula relatively simple, there is a possibilitythat a subtle aspect of a single project may be missed. At the same time,we have proposed an approach which can be easily understood and fairlyapplied. This advantage far outweighs the disadvantages.One commenter argued that since Native American tribes and villages havespecial relationships with the Federal Government, the use of county andstate PCI figures is inappropriate for projects sponsored by these groups.We are persuaded that such projects do warrant different consideration.Indian, Eskimo, and Aleut tribes and villages do not receive support fromstate and local governments. Unfortunately, current income data for reservations,tribes, and villages are very limited. The most recent comprehensive informationis from the Bureau of Census, 1980 Census, which reports median familyincome, by reservation, for 1979 in <T3>American Indians, Eskimos and Aleuts on Identified Reservations andin Historic Areas of Oklahoma (Excluding Urbanized Areas),</T3> Part 1,Table 10; and per capita money income for 1979 in <T3>General Social and Economic Characteristics-United States Summary (1980),</T3> Table 252. The data are for Native Americans living on reservationsor in villages and are not strictly comparable to the income of all Tribalmembers, or for all Native Americans living on or near a reservation orvillage. Our revised procedures require the use of publicly available datasuch as that appearing in the Census publications identified here and acomparison of data for the relevant Indian, Eskimo, or Aleut group to thenational average of the same concept of income and for the same year. Forexample, using the data cited above, the median family income for the reservationwould be compared to 1979 median family income for the United States. Wewill require the use of the most recently available data, which in anycase must be no earlier year than the 1979 data cited above. If later ormore accurate information is available, it may be used as a substituteprovided that the substitute data is comparable to an equivalent nationalaverage which is publicly available. These projects will, of course, alsobe subject to the benefits test.We have maintained our decision from the Interim Final Rule, that all U.S.Territories will be eligible for the full amount of cost-share reductionderived from the benefits test. Unpublished data from the Bureau of EconomicAnalysis indicates that in 1985, per capita personal income in the territoriesranged from 66 percent of the U.S. average (Guam) to 25 percent of theU.S. average (American Samoa).We will continue to exclude unemployment and the sponsor's borrowing capabilityin our Eligibility Factor formula. While no one advocated that unemploymentbe used, several comments addressed our decision to exclude borrowing capability.One commenter for example, pointed out that the legal constraints againstborrowing vary from state to state and should therefore be a factor inour ability to pay analysis. Consideration of these constraints would resultin unequal treatment on a national scale and in our judgment, would beinappropriate. In addition, per capita income itself represents a roughmeasure of fiscal capacity which can be applied without regard to pastspending and taxing decisions, or legal or other institutional constraints.Our final rule implicitly recognizes a potential limit to borrowing capacityfor ``low income projects''. When the Eligibility Factor, described below,exceeds zero we will allow payments over time rather than during construction,for a portion of the non-Federal share. As pointed out above, this repaymentprovision applies whenever the income of the project area and state islow, regardless of the outcome of the benefits test.<ITAG tagnum="84">The Eligibility Formula</ITAG>The eligibility factor (EF) is determined by:<ITAG tagnum="26">EF=a^b<T2>1</T2>andmultiply;(State PCI Index) ^ b<T2>2</T2>andmultiply;(County PCI Index)</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">where a, b<T2>1</T2>, and b<T2>2</T2> are positive constants. The county and state PCI indices area measure of the local PCI relative to the national average. If per capitaincome in a state equals the national average, the state's index numberwould be 100. If a project includes beneficiaries in more than one county,the county PCI index will be a combined PCI index, where each county PCIindex is weighted by the share of project benefits which can be locatedgeographically. Similarly, when project beneficiaries are located in morethan one state, the state index will be determined using weights determinedby the states' shares of project benefits.If EF is less than zero, the project is not eligible for cost-share reductionsunder the ability to pay test. If EF is greater than or equal to one, theproject is eligible for full application of the benefits based cost-sharealternative described above. For EF less than one but greater than zero,the value represents the degree of application for which the project iseligible. For example if the standard cost-share is 50 percent and theminimum cost-share under the ability to pay formula is 30 percent and EF= .6, the non-Federal cost-share reduction will be the fractional amount0.6 or 60 percent of the difference between 50 percent and 30 percent.The cost-share in this example would be 38 percent (50^.06andmultiply;(50-30)=38.0).In the interim final rule, we gave equal weights to state and county PCI,that is b<T2>1</T2> and b<T2>2</T2> were set equal to each other. As discussed above (the role ofthe local sponsor), we have reevaluated the weights and concluded thatthe county index factor should be set at twice the state factor. The valuesfor a, b<T2>1</T2> and b<T2>2</T2> will be published in Engineering Circulars. The formula willreflect our view that the ability to pay provision should only apply inexceptional circumstances. Therefore, two thirds of the counties will notbe eligible; 20 percent of the counties will be eligible for the full application;and the remaining 13\1/3\  percent will be eligible for a partial application.Available county PCI data lag behind available state PCI data. County informationcurrently exists through 1987, state information through 1988. The guidelinesrequire the use of the three latest years even if these years are differentfor counties and states. We believe that this represents the most up todate economic profile of a project area which can be applied uniformlyto all projects.<ITAG tagnum="84">Other Issues</ITAG>We have retained the five percent minimum cash requirement of section 103(a)(1)(A),33 U.S.C. 2213(a)(1)(A), even for projects where the ability to pay testleads to a reduction in the non-Federal cost-share. This requirement isintended to demonstrate that the non-Federal interest has a serious commitmentto the project. It is identical to the cash requirement in the interimfinal rule. One commenter found no basis for a cash requirement in section103(a)(1)(A) (although the comments included recognition that section 104(g),33 U.S.C. 2214, refers to the 103(a)(1)(A) requirement as a cash requirement.We believe that this reference, plus the language in the Conference Reportfor Public Law 99-662 (p. 206) shows clearly that a 5 percent cash paymentis required under standard cost-sharing of structural flood control projects.By keeping the 5 percent cash requirement under the ability to pay provision,it may be necessary to negotiate cash repayments to the local sponsor atthe end of the project, or to make Federal payments for Lands, Easements,Rights of Way, Relocations, and Dredge Material Disposal Areas (LERRD)that are, under standard cost-sharing, the responsibility of the non-Federalinterest.Two commenters observed that the Ability to Pay Interim Final Rule didnot address the relationship between credits given under section 104 andcost-share reductions under 103(m). In cases where a project is eligiblefor both credits and a cost-share reduction, the ability to pay calculationshould be made first. Credits would then be applied against the non-Federalshare as adjusted. The application of credits is subject to a separateregulation, ER 1165-2-29, published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>, Nov. 18, 1987 (33 CFR 240).The remaining comments (and our response) are listed here:<T3>Comment: </T3>The ecological design of a project can reduce economicbenefits, which becomes a liability under the ability to pay guidelines.<T3>Response: </T3>When economic benefits are reduced, the project's benefit-costratio is reduced, increasing the likelihood that there will be a reductionunder the ability to pay test.<T3>Comment: </T3>The Secretary does not have the legal authority to reducethe non-Federal share under section 103(m).<T3>Response: </T3>In our judgment, the record shows that this authorityhas in fact been given to the Secretary.<T3>Comment: </T3>It is not clear how the rule is to be applied when thestate, rather than a smaller entity, is the non-Federal sponsor.<T3>Response: </T3>The rule is applied to all projects in exactly the sameway regardless of the nature of the local sponsor.<T3>Comment: </T3>The rule should include a chart showing how the abilityto pay tests would affect projects with various characteristics.<T3>Response: </T3>This suggestion was made by an advocate of a simplerformula. Given the number of factors in the final rule, a chart may causeimprecision in the application of the rule which our formula avoids.Three other points have arisen during application of the interim rule whichrequire clarification. First, some projects have been authorized withoutcalculation of the economic benefit-cost ratio as defined in the WaterResource Council's Principles and Guidelines. In these cases, such a calculationmust be made before the ability to pay test can be applied. Second, whendetermining the alternative cost share, it should be calculated to thenearest \1/10\ of one percent. Finally, the test must be applied to projectsconstructed under section 208 of the 1954 Flood Control Act, 33 U.S.C.701g (as amended), as well as the projects constructed under the othercontinuing authority programs identified in the interim final rule.<ITAG tagnum="84">E.O. 12291 and Regulatory Flexibility Act</ITAG>This rule is not a major rule within the meaning of Executive Order 12291,because it is not likely to result in: (1) An annual effect on the economyof $100 million or more; (2) a major increase in costs or prices for consumers,individual industries, Federal, State, or local government agencies, orgeographic regions; or (3) significant adverse effects on competition,employment, investment, productivity, innovation, or on the ability ofUnited States based enterprises to compete with foreign based enterprisesin domestic or export markets.Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. section 605(b) I hereby certify that this rule willnot have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of smallentities.

As a result of the applicationof the test, some projects will be cost-shared by the non-Federal interestat a lower level than the standard non-Federal share that would be requiredunder the provisions of section 103 of Public Law 99-662, 33 U.S.C. 2213.The ``standard share'', as used herein, refers to the non-Federal sharethat would apply to the project before any ability to pay consideration.(b) Section 103(m) requires that all cost-sharing agreements for floodcontrol covered by the terms of section 103(a) or 103(b) be subject tothe ability to pay test. The test must therefore be applied not only toprojects specifically authorized by Congress, but to the continuing authorityprojects constructed under Section 14 of the 1946 Flood Control Act (33U.S.C. 701r), section 205 of the 1948 Flood Control Act (33 U.S.C. 701s),and section 208 of the 1954 Flood Control Act (33 U.S.C. 701g), all asamended.(c) The ability to pay test shall be conducted independently of any analysisof a project sponsor's ability to finance its ultimate share of proposedproject costs. The ability to finance is addressed in a statement of financialcapability which considers current borrowing constraints, alternative sourcesof liquidity, etc. It is therefore much more narrowly defined than theability to pay test, which considers the underlying resource base of thecommunity as a whole. The ability to pay test shall not be used to affectproject scope, or to change budgetary priorities among projects competingfor scarce Federal funds.(d) Any reductions in the level of non-Federal cost-sharing as a resultof the application of this test will be applied to construction costs only.Operations, maintenance and rehabilitation responsibilities are unaffectedby the ability to pay test.(e) When projects are eligible for credits as outlined in ER 1165-2-29,reference andSection; 241.3(e), the ability to pay test will be applied beforeany adjustments are made for credits. If the ability to pay test resultsin a lower non-Federal share, the allowable amount of credits will be limitedby the lower share.(f) The test is based on the following principles:(1) Since the standard non-Federal cost-share is substantilly less thanfull costs in every case, the ability to pay test should be structuredso that reductions in the level of cost-sharing will be granted in onlya limited number of cases of severe economic hardship.(2) The test should depend not only on the economic circumstances withina project area, but also on the conditions of the state(s) in which theproject area is located. Although states' policies with respect to supportinglocal interests on flood control projects are not uniform, the state representsa potential source of financial assistance which should be considered inthe analysis.(3) The alternative level of cost-sharing determined under the abilityto pay principle should be governed in part by project benefits. If, asa result of the project, local beneficiaries receive more income, or arerequired to use fewer resources on flood damage repair or replacement,or on flood insurance, a portion of these resources should be availableto pay for the non-Federal share, even in those cases where an analysisof current economic conditions indicates that there are relatively limitedresources in the project area and its state.(4) Since project benefits represent availability of resources in the future,but not the present, project sponsors should be permitted to defer a certainpercentage of the non-Federal share whenever current economic circumstancessuggest that non-Federal resources may be limited.(g) The Non-Federal interest may, at its discretion, waive the applicationof the ability to pay test. In this case, the Non-Federal interest shallbe considered to have the ability to pay the standard cost-share and nofurther economic inquiry will be required.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 241.5</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Procedures for estimating the alternative cost-share.</ITAG>(a) <T3>Step one, the benefits test.</T3> Determine the maximum possible reductionin the level of non-Federal cost-sharing for any project.(1) Calculate the ratio of flood control benefits (developed using theWater Resources Council's<T3> Principles and Guidelines</T3>_ref. andSection; 241.3(b)) to flood controlcosts for the project based on the discount rate which the Corps is currentlyusing to evaluate projects. Costs include operations and maintenance aswell as first costs. Divide the result by four. For example, if the project's(or separable element's) benefit-cost ratio is 1.2:1, the factor for thisproject equals 0.3. If a project has been authorized for construction withouta benefit-cost ratio calculated in accordance with the Principles and Guidelines,determination of the ratio is a prerequisite for consideration under theability to pay provision.(2) If the factor determined in andSection; 241.5(a)(1), when expressed asa percentage, is greater than the standard level of cost-sharing, the standardlevel will apply.(3) If the factor determined in andSection; 241.5(a)(1), when expressed asa percentage, is less than the standard level of cost-sharing, projectsmay be eligible for either a reduction in the non-Federal share to this``benefits based floor'' (BBF), or for  a partial reduction to a sharebetween the standard level and the BBF, as determined by the proceduresin step two, andSection; 243.5. In no case however, will the non-Federalcost-share be less than five percent.(b) <T3>Step two, the income test.</T3> Projects may qualify for the full amountof the reduction in cost-sharing calculated in Step one, or for some fractionof the reduction in cost-sharing, depending on a measure of the currenteconomic resources of the project area and of the state or states in whichthe project is located.(1) To assure consistency, the calculations in andSection; 241.5(b) (2) and(3) will be performed by HQUSACE and distributed to all FOA's via EngineeringCirculars. The information will be updated and distributed to HQUSACE andto the field as soon as new data are available. The procedures may be verifiedfor any single county or state using the sources cited.(2) For each of the three latest calendar years for which information isavailable, determine the level of per capita personal income in the statein which the project beneficiaries are located, and compare this to thenational average of per capita personal income.

Determine thestate's per capita personal income as an index number in comparision tothe national average (U.S.=100), and calculate the three year average ofthe state's index number.(3) For each of the three latest calendar years for which information isavailable, determine the level of per capita personal income in the countywhere the project beneficiaries are located (the ``project area''), andcompare this to the national average of per capita personal income. Source:Dept. of Commerce, Bureau of Economic Analysis, as published yearly inthe April <T3>Survey of Current Business.</T3> (If the project beneficiaries arelocated in Alaska or Hawaii, divide the county's per capita personal incomefigure by one plus the percentage used in the Federal Government's costof living pay differential for Federal workers who purchase local retailand who use private housing, employed in Anchorage, AK or Oahu, HI.) Calculatethe index for the county's per capita personal income to the national average(U.S.=100), and calculate the three year average of the county's indexnumber.(4) When the project area, as determined by the location of the project'sbeneficiaries, includes more than one county, calculate a composite projectarea index by taking a weighted average of the county index numbers, theweights being equal to the relative levels of benefits received in eachcounty. When the project area includes more than one state, the state indexfor the project should be calculated using the same weighting technique.(5) Calculate an ``Eligibility Factor'' for the project according to thefollowing formula:<ITAG tagnum="26">EF=a^b<T2>1</T2>andmultiply;(state factor)^b<T2>2</T2> x (area factor).</ITAG>If EF is one or more, the project is eligible for the full reduction incost-share to the benefits based floor. If EF is zero or less, the projectis not eligible for a reduction. If EF is between zero and one, the non-Federalcost-share will be reduced proportionately to an amount which is greaterthan the BBF but less than the standard non-Federal cost-share in accordancewith the procedures described in paragraph andSection; 241.5(c) below. Thevalues of a, b<T2>1</T2>  and b<T2>2</T2> will be determined by HQUSACE. The parameter values will bebased on the latest available data and set so that 20 percent of countieshave an EF of 1.0 or more, while 66.7 percent have an EF of 0 or less.These values will be adjusted periodically as new information becomes available.Changes will be published in Engineering Circulars. The values will beset so that b<T2>2</T2>=2andmultiply;b<T2>1</T2>, giving local income twice the weight of state income.(6) Since estimates (available from the Bureau of Economic Analysis) ofper capita personal income for Puerto Rico, Guam and other U.S. territoriesare well below the national average, the eligibility factor for projectsin these areas is administratively established to be equal to 1.(7) For flood control projects sponsored by Native American tribes or villages,the EF shall be calculated using information on tribe or village incomeas a replacement factor for both the area and state factor (that is multiplythe replacement income factor by both b<T2>1</T2> and b<T2>2</T2> and subtract each from a in the equation in andSection; 241.5(b)(5)).The replacement factor will be tribe or village income as a percentageof the national average for the equivalent definition of income (for examplea Tribe's median family income as a percentage of the median family incomefor all U.S. families). The data should be the latest available information.It is acceptable, but not required that the data be obtained from the Bureauof the Census, <T3>American Indians, Eskimos and Aleuts on Identified Reservations andin Historic Areas of Oklahoma (Excluding Urbanized Areas), </T3>part 1,Table 10, or <T3>General Social and Economic Characteristics_United States Summary (1980),</T3>Table 252. Since both sources contain information for Native Americansliving on reservations, rather than all Tribe or Village members, the sourcesshould be used only when appropriate, or when no better information isavailable.(c) <T3>Application of the Ability to Pay Formula to the Basic Cost-sharingProvisions of Section 103.</T3> If a flood control project has a BBF whichis less than the standard cost-share and an EF which is greater than zero,the non-Federal cost-share will be reduced. The alternative non-Federalshare will be calculated and reported to the nearest one tenth of one percent.The actual reduction is determined by applying the ability to pay formulato the basic flood control cost-sharing provisions of section 103 of PublicLaw 99-662, 33 U.S.C. 2213, as follows:<ITAG tagnum="26">(1) When EF &quot; 1, non-Federal cost-share = BBF</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">(2) For structural projects covered by section 103(a), when 0 andless;EF andless; 1:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">(i) If LERRD equals or exceeds 45 percent:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="24">non-Federal cost-share=50^EFandmultiply;(50^BBF)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">(ii) If LERRD exceeds 20 percent but is less than 45 percent:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="24">non-Federal cost-share=(LERRD+5)^ERandmultiply; [ (LERRD+5)^BBF ]</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">(iii) If LERRD is less than 20 percent:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="24">non-Federal cost-share=25^EFandmultiply;(25^BBF)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">(3) For non-structural projects covered by section 103(b), when 0andless; EF andless; 1:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="24">non-Federal cost-share = 25^EFandmultiply;(25-BBF)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">(4) In no case however, can the non-Federal share be less than fivepercent, even if the calculation made in andSection; 241.5(c) (1), (2), or(3) results in a smaller number.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">(5) Note: LERRD equals the costs of lands, easements, rights-of-way,relocations, and dredged material disposal areas expressed as a percentageof total project costs. The BBF and numerical terms in the equations aboveare also expressed as percentages.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 241.6</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Deferred payments for certain qualifying projects.</ITAG>(a) Whenever a project's Eligibility Factor exceeds zero, the project sponsorwill be permitted to defer a portion of its share of flood control costs.The maximum allowable amount deferred equals the total non-Federal shareless (for structural projects) five percent of total project costs andless (for all projects) any amounts for LERRD paid for or acquired by thesponsor prior to the time the LCA is signed. If for example, the non-Federalshare of a structural project = 35.0 percent (after the ability to payadjustment, if any) of which 10 percent is LERRD already paid for by thelocal sponsor, the maximum allowable amount to be deferred = 20 percentof project flood control costs (35 less the 5 percent cash requirements,less the 10 percent LERRD already acquired). Deferred payments at the optionof the sponsor will be allowed regardless of the outcome of the benefitstest described in andSection; 241.5(a) whenever the Eligibility Factor exceedszero.(b) When EF &quot; 1, the project sponsor may defer as much as the maximum allowableamount as described in andSection; 241.6(a).(c) When 0 andless; EF andless; 1, the sponsor may defer a fraction of themaximum allowable amount described in andSection; 241.6(a), where the fractionequals the Eligibility Factor expressed to three decimal places. Continuingthe example described in andSection; 241.6(a), if EF = .712, total alloweddeferral equals .712 andmultiply; 20 percent = 14.2 percent of total projectcosts.(d) The deferred payment can be made in equal installments over any periodof time selected by the non-Federal sponsor, provided that all repaymentsare made between the end of construction and thirty years thereafter. Theamount repaid shall include interest during the repayment period as wellas interest for the appropriate portion of the construction period forany amounts deferred prior to the end of construction. The rate of interestshall be determined in accordance with the provisions of section 106 ofPublic Law 99-662, 33 U.S.C. 2216.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 241.7</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Application of test.</ITAG>(a) A preliminary ability to pay test will be applied during the studyphase of any proposed project. If the ability to pay cost-share is lowerthan the standard share, the revised estimated cost-share will be usedfor budgetary and other planning purposes.(b) The official application of the ability to pay test will be made atthe time the Local Cooperation Agreement (LCA) between the Corps of Engineersand the Non-Federal sponsor is signed. For structural flood control projects,the standard level of cost-sharing will not be known until the end of theproject (since the standard level as specified in section 103(a), 33 U.S.C.2213, includes LERRD). In this case, if the Eligibility Factor is greaterthan zero but less than one, the ability to pay non-Federal share willbe determined using estimated costs.(c) The LCA for all projects subject to the ability to pay test will includea ``whereas'' clause indicating the results of the test. If the projectis eligible for a lower non-Federal share:(1) The revised share will be specified in the LCA (there will be no recalculationof this share once the LCA is signed).(2) An exhibit attached to the LCA will include the Benefits Based Floor(BBF) determined in andSection; 241.5(a); the Eligibility Factor (EF) determinedin andSection; 241.5(b); if the Eligibility Factor is greater than zero butless than one, the estimated standard non-Federal share; and the formulaused in determining the ability to pay share as described in paragraphsandSection; 241.5 (c)(1) through (c)(4).(d) If at the time of project completion, the standard non-Federal sharebased on actual costs is less than the ability to pay share specified inthe LCA, the standard share will apply.(e) For structural projects. (1) If the standard LERRD plus cash requirementexceeds the ability to pay cost-share, the Federal Government will makeany necessary adjustments in expenditures in the following order: First,paying any cash requirement in excess of five percent of total projectcosts (if any) that would, under standard cost-sharing, have been the responsibilityof the non-Federal sponsor; second, making payments for LERRD; and third,providing for reimbursement at the end of construction. Federal paymentsfor LERRD will be made only after the non-Federal payment for LERRD reachesa percentage of total project costs equal to the ability to pay non-Federalcost-share less the five percent cash requirement. If such arrangementsare necessary, the LCA should be prepared to reflect agreement on the bestmanner available for acquisition of those LERRD over the limiting percentage,or for reimbursing the sponsor upon completion of construction.(2) The non-Federal sponsor will be required to provide a cash paymentequal to a minimum of five percent of estimated total project costs, regardlessof the outcome of the ability to pay test. The project sponsor shall makecash payments during construction at a rate such that the amount of non-Federalpayments in each year, as a percentage of total non-Federal cash payments,equals the amount of Federal expenditures (including sunk pre-constructionengineering and design costs as a first year Federal construction expenditure)as a percentage of total Federal expenditures. Total Federal expendituresinclude cash payments for construction and if necessary (due to abilityto pay considerations), for LERRD, and for reimbursement to the non-Federalsponsor. Total Federal expenditures for the purpose of this calculation,do not include expenditures which allow the non-Federal sponsor to deferpayment of the non-Federal share under the provisions of this rule.(f) For non-structural projects, reductions in the non-Federal cost-shareas a result of the ability to pay test will not affect the procedures fordetermining the non-Federal and Federal payment schedules. For non-structuralprojects, no specific cash payments during construction are required bylaw.<ITAG tagnum="40">[FR Doc. 89-22918 Filed 9-29-89; 8:45 am]</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 3710-92-M</ITAG></ITAG></ITAG></TEXT></DOC>
