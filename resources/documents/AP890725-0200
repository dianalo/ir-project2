Assistant U.S. Attorney Elliot B. Jacobson attacked thecredibility of Meese, who testified for Wallach, in his closingarguments after 2{ months of trial.   Jacobson cited an internal Justice Department review thatfaulted Meese for his efforts to help Wallach in an ill-fated,Mideast oil pipeline proposal and to assist him with the WedtechCorp., a now-defunct defense contractor.   Wallach, a San Francisco personal injury lawyer, was charged ina 21-count racketeering indictment with extracting almost $2million in illegal payoffs and payments from Wedtech, includingsome $525,000 in alleged bribes to Wallach to influence Meese andother government officials.   The other defendants are W. Franklyn Chinn, 47, a former Wedtechboard member and onetime Meese financial adviser, and a businessassociate of theirs, R. Kent London.   Meese testified that Wallach never asked him to givepreferential treatment to Wedtech.   Wedtech, once a small machine shop, grew into a $100 milliongovernment contractor through a special Small BusinessAdministration program that set aside contracts without competitivebidding for minority-controlled companies.   Evidence at earlier trials has shown that Wedtech continued toreceive the no-bid contracts through a series of bribe schemes evenafter it ceased to be a minority-owned company.   The Wedtech investigation did not result in any criminal chargesagainst Meese, but Jacobson said: ``As counsel to the president andas attorney general, Edwin Meese III was at best incompetent and atworst corrupt.''   Jacobson said Meese used his testimony as a ``vehicle not onlyto vindicate his best friend but also himself.''   Jacobson said numerous character witnesses who testified aboutWallach's work for good causes did not know, or chose to ignore,his bad side.   ``That is the side of Bob Wallach that wanted money and wantedpower and wanted both in the worst way,'' he said. ``Money was thedriving force in Robert Wallach's life.''   Jacobson also addressed the credibility of the prosecution'smain witnesses, including Mario Moreno, a former Wedtech vicechairman who has pleaded guilty in the case.   He said the witnesses were ``crooks'' but that their testimonywas credible because they were at the center of the criminalconspiracy.   Jacobson told the jurors not to believe defense arguments thatcorrupt Wedtech officials took advantage of the defendants.   ``These are three sophisticated men. They weren't duped intoanything,'' he said.   Defense closing arguments were scheduled for Wednesday.</TEXT></DOC>
