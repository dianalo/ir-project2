Anderson Siemens Corporate Research Group Leader for Modelingand Simulation System TechnologyandM;* Elaine Weyuker New York University Professor of Computer ScienceandM;* Fran Allen IBM Thomas J. Watson Research Center IBM Fellow, Member of theNational Academy of EngineeringandM;In addition to interest, enthusiasm and stature in the computer sciencecommunity each member brings to the committee a rich history of involvementwith women's and minorities' issues; each offers a valuable perspective onthe problems in encouraging women and minorities to choose a career incomputer science.andP;  Many computer scientists have offered to help thecommittee so that each committee member will be supported by a subcommitteeof volunteers.andM;Additional perspective is offered by the three members of the advisory board:andM;* Claudia Withers, head of employment programs for the Women's Legal DefenseFund,andM;* Norma Mertz, professor of educational leadership at the University ofTennessee,andM;* Roger Wilkins, civil rights activist, professor of history at George MasonUniversity, and head of the Pulitzer Prize Board.andM;The advisory board will keep us informed of developments in other disciplinesthat have bearing on the committee's activities.andM;The activities of the committee will revolve around four major concerns:andM;* Monitoring the status of women and minorities in industrial and academiccomputing.andM;* Promoting activities that result in more equal representation of women andminorities in industrial and academic computing,andM;* Acting as a repository of information about programs, documents andpolicies that can increase the representation of women and minorities inindustrial and academic computing, andandM;* Publicizing the progress made in the previous three categories.andM;By monitoring the status of women and minorities, we can provide baselinesagainst which progress can be measured.andP;  In particular, we want to documentthe &quot;pipeline&quot; through which students travel on their way to becomingcomputer scientists.andP;  The documentation should provide visibility into areasof opportunity for improvement.andP;  The information gathered will suggest andsupport the other activities of the committee.andM;To document the pipeline, the committee will develop a database ofinformation about women and minorities in computing at various levels:graduates of grade school/high school/college, and those with M.A./M.S./Ph.D.andO;degrees in computer science/software engineering (and percentage of totalpool).andP;  The database will also contain information about organizations,institutions and companies--the percentage of women and minorities at eachlevel (entry, technical, managerial, and so on) and perhaps their skills oreducational backgrounds.andP;  Much of this information exists, but it is notcentralized.andP;  Many of the studies reporting this information have conflictingconclusions.andP;  We will gather as much information as we can, analyze it fortrends and discrepancies, and use it to help determine the other activitiesof the committee.andP;  Preparatory work for this activity has already begun.andO;Members of the &quot;Systers&quot; list (an electronic distribution list of over 300women in computing) have suggested several places where some of the dataresides, and the committee will continue compiling and cataloging theinformation.andP;  Anita Borg, administrator of &quot;Systers,&quot; has begun a parallelproject sponsored by Digital Equipment Corporation.andP;  The new project involvesthe creation of a database of information about women in computing--who theyare, what their backgrounds are, their areas of interest, and so on.andP;  Thedatabase can be used to suggest women speakers and participants in variousarenas.andP;  The committee will investigate the creation of a similar databasefor minority computer scientists.andM;In the long term, examining the pipeline should suggest follow-up activitiesthat will encourage more women and minorities to study and work in computerscience.andP;  Until those areas of opportunity are identified, the committee willfocus on establishing a set of pilot projects that encourage the mentoring ofwomen and minorities at different levels.andP;  Several organizations, includingsome at Contel, have expressed interest in executive mentoring projects,wherein women and minorities would be encouraged to work with mentors whowill help them understand how to succeed in the corporation.andP;  Additionalpilot projects will focus on alliances between business and academia,possibly working with local high school students or creating specialbusiness-university programs.andP;  The mentoring projects will be assisted byNorma Mertz, former head of the Southeast Equity Center, who is well knownfor her work in establishing guidelines for executive mentoring programs.andP;  Atthe same time, the committee will build a library of information aboutsuccessful programs and policies.andP;  The information collected will be locatedat the Contel Technology Center and will be accessible to the general public.andO;In addition, callers can request the names and addresses of successful womenand minorities who are willing to speak at schools, companies and communityorganizations.andP;  In this way, people who need information about problems,programs and policies related to women and minorities need call only thiscentral location.andM;We will update our progress annually regarding the size of the pools fromwhich we draw our employees; researchers; students; whether our field isrepresentative of the pool; and also whether progress is being made (andperhaps why).andP;  Additional articles will be submitted to ACM and IEEEpublications, featuring organizations, programs, techniques or policies thatare successful in increasing the representation of women and minorities incomputer science.andM;Other organizations and committees have similar sympathies and purposes.andP;  Wedo not intend to compete with these other sources of information andanalysis.andP;  Rather, we will coordinate our efforts so that programs andactivities are performed in cooperation with others.andP;  To that end, ElaineWeyuker will serve on both the ACM committee and a similar committee formedby the Computing Research Association.andM;We are a small committee with an opportunity to make a big difference.andP;  Themore diverse our profession, the more creative and flexible we can be--andthe more important our contribution to the world we live in.andP;  I invite you tojoin us in our activities.andP;  We welcome your interest, your support, yoursuggestions, and your participation.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
