Martin Luther King Jr. andsaid the slain black American's non-violent civil rights movementheld some lessons for South Africa.   Perkins told reporters he did not ``tend to equate'' South Africaand the United States, ``but searching for non-violent solutions isprobably something worth thinking about'' in South Africa.   Perkins, the first black U.S. ambassador to South Africa, andZenos Frudakis, the Philadelphia sculptor who made the bust,unveiled the work under a tent on a bushy plot where a new U.S.Embassy is to be built.   The 125 onlookers at the gathering in Pretoria included black andwhite South Africans prominent in campaigns against the apartheidsystem of legalized race segregation, and a low-level representativefrom the South African Ministry of Foreign Affairs.   A 30-member choir from the Roman Catholic church of St. PeterClaver in Mamelodi, a black township near Pretoria, sang severalcivil rights hymns. Women in red headscarves and conical hats wovenfrom grass mingled with dark-suited diplomats.   One hymn was ``Senatla Martin Luther King.'' Senatla means leaderin the Sotho language.   Enos Mabuza, chief minister of South Africa's KaNgwane blackhomeland, told the gathering there were striking parallels betweenthe racial separation in South African today and segregation in theUnited States during King's lifetime. A major difference, he said,was that the U.S. Constitution protects individual rights but SouthAfrican laws ``protect white privilege and white-minority rule.''   Mabuza said ``the black people in this country have realized thatthe oppressor will never voluntarily give freedom to the oppressed.The oppressed must demand that freedom.''   Today was a federal holiday in the United States honoring King,who was assassinated in 1968. The civil rights leader would havebeen 60 years old on Sunday.</TEXT></DOC>
