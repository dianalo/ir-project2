Some of the rumors suggest that Apple'stop brass were unhappy about Claris's increasing enthusiasm for Windows,which Claris president Bill Campbell just recently endorsed at PC Expo.andP;  Butthe more interesting and plausible theory is that Apple actually wants Claristo target the DOS market, not just with applications but also withsystem-level products.andP;  Claris vice president of marketing John zeisler tellsus that Apple's new strategy is to use Claris to extend Apple's softwaretechnology to other platforms, particularly Windows.andP;  Proprietary doesn'tmean you have to sell it all yourself,&quot; he says.andP;  And there's no reasonAsymetrix should have a monopoly on something like ToolBook.&quot; Does Applereally believe it can sell Mac software into the DOS world? It's not a crazyidea.andP;  Apple and Claris both have plenty of technology that isn't necessarilyplatform-specific.andP;  Zeisler argues that, with proper marketing, AppleTalkcould have become a major multi-platform network standard.andP;  A Windows versionof HyperCard also makes good sense.andP;  Claris's HyperHelp technology, the AppleData Access Language (CL/1), TrueType, and lots of Mac utilities could all beported successfully to the PC.andP;  The fact is, Apple has been developinggraphical systems software for seven years now; certainly, at least some ofthis technology is better than any DOS or Windows counterparts.andP;  Okay, butcan Apple really make money selling software? Software has always been anickel-and-dime business for Apple, which is why the early Mac applicationswere neglected until Claris came along.andP;  But the strategic value to Apple ofselling system-level software is immense.andP;  If enough Mac technology wereavailable on other hardware platforms, Apple might be able to convince morecorporate buyers that the Mac isn't a proprietary environment.andP;  And ifWindows versions of Apple software turn out to be compelling enough, somenumber of DOS users are bound to take a fresh look at those products runningnatively on the Mac itself.andP;  But won't that strategy stimulate a freshassault by Mac clone makers? Apple has always fought vigorously to protectits system software, but there's a growing recognition that legal barriersaren't a sufficient defense any more.andP;  Regardless of the outcome of theApple-Microsoft litigation, Windows won't go away.andP;  And it's only a matter oftime before someone reverse engineers the Mac ROM chips and gets away withit.andP;  Our guess, in fact, is that Apple has been thinking about the approachIBM has followed with the gradual rollout of OS/2.andP;  In theory, OS/2 (likeDOS) is an entirely open environment that any clone or compatible vendor canadopt.andP;  But the reality is that Big Blue always always ends up with a lead ofat least six months to a year before new versions of OS/2 are ready fornon-IBM machines--and some OS/2 technology, such as the Extended Edition, wasoff limits to compatibles right from the beginning.andP;  If Apple takes thisgeneral approach, we can expect Claris to become a kind of in-house versionof Microsoft, carefully doling out just enough Mac-compatible technology tokeep Apple well ahead of its hardware competitors.andP;  As a side benefit,Apple--like IBM--would get to focus on high-end, high-margin systems, whileletting clone vendors cut each other's throats on lower-priced systems.andO;Doesn't the re-acquisition send a chilling message to the third-party macsoftware community? Realistically, hard-core Mac developers just don't matterto Apple the way they used to.andP;  A few years ago, T/Maker's Heidi Roizenpointed out that the typical Mac developer generates about as much money as a Northern California dry cleaner.&quot; Spinning off Claris didn't revive thethird-party Mac community; re-acquiring Claris also won't make muchdifference.andP;  The fact is, most of the best-selling Mac titles now come fromsoftware companies that are primarily DOS-oriented (like Microsoft,Ashton-Tate, and WordPerfect) or that have crash programs under way to porttheir lead products to Windows.andP;  Apple doesn't have much leverage to keepthese developers in the fold, but if Claris does a bangup job of marketingthe Mac's sexier system-level features, Apple actually might persuade a fewkey DOS developers to pay more attention to the Mac.andP;  Can Apple really betrusted to keep its hands off Claris? That's ultimately the most importantissue.andP;  As an entrepreneurial venture, Claris was an absolutegem--innovative, aggressive, beautifully managed.andP;  Now, even though Claris'stop managers will have a good deal of freedom to operate within Apple, theirdivision's fundamental mission has changed.andP;  Claris has become part of acompany whose goal is to sell hardware, not software.andP;  Despite the best ofintentions, Apple's leadership sooner or later is bound to start tinkeringwith Claris for &quot;strategic&quot; reasons.andP;  Once the politics gets heavy, we don'texpect Claris will keep its entrepreneurial spirit (or its founders) for verylong.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
