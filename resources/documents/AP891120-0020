The 81-year-old Sir Rex said he still suffers from stage fright.   ``Every night,'' he said in an interview published Sunday in TheNew York Times. ``I suppose if you don't have stage fright you goon like a flat pancake.''   In his first stage appearance 63 years ago, when he played ananguished young father in a Liverpool Repertory Company production,he fumbled his only line: ```It's a doctor,''' he recalled. ```Fetch a baby.'''   ``The Circle'' also stars Glynis Johns and Stewart Granger atthe Ambassador Theater. Harrison, who was knighted by QueenElizabeth II earlier this year in recognition of his contributionto the arts, said it may be his final play.   ``I'd like to have more time to myself, more time to paint,'' hesaid. ``I want to potter a bit.''</TEXT><NOTE>Eds: A version moved on sports wires.</NOTE><DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Dick Beardsley was once among the country'stop marathon runners. But following surgery on his left leg, whichwas mangled in a farm accident, doctors and friends are hoping thathe'll walk again.   ``The goal right now is to get Dick to be able to walk again andhopefully be able to work on the farm. The prospects for Dick toever run even recreationally are not being discussed,'' saidBeardsley's coach, Bill Wenmark.   Beardsley finished second in the 1982 Boston Marathon, and histime of two hours, eight minutes and 53 seconds remains one of thefastest ever by a U.S. runner. He retired from marathons last year.   Beardsley, 33, was transferring corn to a crib on Nov. 13 whenhis coveralls got caught in a drive shaft used to power farmequipment. He suffered cuts on his calf muscles in his left leg andsevere ligament damage to the left knee.   ``He's really a very lucky man to be alive,'' Wenmark said.Beardsley's prognosis was fair following Saturday's surgery.   Wenmark said he believes Beardsley will cope well with theinjury. ``I don't think the love of his life, which is running, isas important as his life,'' he said.   A fund has been set up to help Beardsley, who had no healthinsurance at the time of the accident. Donations are being acceptedfor the Dick Beardsley Fund at the Lake Area Security Bank inLindstrom.</TEXT><DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The spring of 1986 should have been the besttime in Quincy Jones' life. He had just won three Grammy Awards forproducing, ``We Are the World,'' the decade's biggest-sellingsingle.   He was ready to record with Michael Jackson a follow-up to``Thriller,'' the best-selling album of all time. And film studioswere calling after Jones scored and co-produced ``The ColorPurple.''   But his 12-year marriage to actress Peggy Lipton was crumbling,his mother-in-law was dying of cancer, and he was suffering fromexhaustion and overwork.   ``At one point I was experiencing about seven of the Top 10stress factors,'' he said in an interview published in Sunday's LosAngeles Times.   Now, at 56, Jones said he is on the rebound and is celebratinghis return with a new album, ``Back on the Block.''   The album, to be released Tuesday, features hot young rappers,be-bop legends, and such guests as Ella Fitzgerald. It also drawsfrom Jones' broad career.   ``I feel like the luckiest man in music, to have come along inthe swing era and then seen modern jazz, rock 'n roll, doo-wop,folk and everything else happen,'' he said. ``I've seen a lot ofbeats go by in 40 years.''</TEXT><DATELINE>NASHVILLE, Tenn.
