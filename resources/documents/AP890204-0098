The leaders decided at a meeting at Ghazi Abad, about 15 milesoutside Jalalabad, to press their siege of the city so that nosupplies get through to Afghan army forces.   The insurgents said Jalalabad, about 90 miles east of the Afghancapital of Kabul, could be the first major city to fall after theSoviets complete their military withdrawal from the nation.   Jalalabad's fall would weaken the defenses of Kabul and open upthe highway to the capital, the guerrillas said.   Abdul Zaher, a senior commander of the Jamiat-i-Islami guerrillagroup, said the insurgents do not want to attack the crowded cityfor fear of injuring civilians.   But the guerrillas will have no choice if Afghan troops attemptto hold out, and an assault could come within 10 days, Zaher said.   The guerrilla forces are moving to take control of Afghanistanwhen the Soviets complete their pullout. Under a U.N.-mediatedaccord, the Red Army is suposed to be out of Afghanistan by Feb. 15.   It entered the country in 1979 to back Afghan troops in their warwith Moslem guerrillas.   Occasional artillery fire from government forces outsideJalalabad could be heard Saturday, but guerrillas appeared incontrol of the surrounding countryside.   Trucks and buses filled with heavily armed insurgents moved upthe highways leading to the city, and Zaher said up to 12,000guerrillas surrounded Jalalabad.   He said there were an undetermined but much smaller number ofAfghan troops and that they were demoralized.   ``There are only a few communists who still want to fight,''Zaher said.   But the guerrillas did not appear to have artillery or otherheavy weapons they might need for a decisive attack. Jalalabad was amajor Soviet army and air base and reportedly has powerful defenses.   The guerrillas plan to blockade supply routes and then expectJalalabad, Kabul and other cities to fall quickly.   ``The fighting will end when the Russians withdraw, an Islamicgovernment is established and the communists surrender,'' Zaher said.   Guerrilla forces have taken over and occupied all government armybases and outposts along the main highway connecting Jalalabad tothe Pakistani border about 45 miles away.   Burned out government tanks, armored personnel carriers andtrucks destroyed in fighting last month are strewn along the road.   A large explosion Saturday near the guerrilla base at Ghazi Abadwas caused by a long-range rocket fired by government forces,guerrillas said. There was no sign of Afghan air force planes andthe insurgents said there had been no air attacks in the area inrecent days.   Some guerrilla leaders, fearing civilian casualties, have saidthey do not want to launch major attacks on cities. But others saidprivately that some of the seven rival Moslem groups are pressingfor quick action.   After Jalalabad falls, the guerrillas there would reinforce theinsurgents at Kabul, Zaher said.   He said the commanders of the guerrilla groups were cooperatingin taking Jalalabad and that plans were under way to run the cityand ensure the safety of civilians and property after its fall.   Guerrilla officers also said appeals were being made at mosquesto avoid unnecessary bloodshed.   ``We're fighting only the communists. Do not harm the good peoplewhen we take Kabul, do not loot or kill,'' an Islamic mullah, orpriest, said in a sermon broadcast over loudspeakers Saturday in onearea held by insurgents.   Some Western aid officials and Afghans have expressed fears ofbloodshed, reprisals and looting by vengeful guerrillas.   ``We don't want any bad things to happen,'' Zaher said.</TEXT></DOC>
