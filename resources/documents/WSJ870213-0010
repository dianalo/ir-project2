Garcia</HL><DD> 02/13/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> STOCK MARKET, OFFERINGS (STK)STOCK INDEXES (NDX) </IN><TEXT>   The stock market had a roller-coaster session yesterday as erratic trading in a big blue-chip issue and fresh indictments in Wall Street's insider trading scandal rocked already nervous investors. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished the busy day at 2165.78, down 6.18 points.    The industrial average initially extended Wednesday's gains, helped by a strong bond market and a sharp but fleeting rise in the share price of Minnesota Mining andamp; Manufacturing, one of the 30 stocks the average comprises. At 11:30 a.m. EST, the industrial average showed a gain of more than 13 points. The advance came despite some heavy profit-taking in semiconductor and oil stocks.    However, most stock price gains faded quickly after news reports that the arbitrage chiefs at Kidder Peabody and Goldman Sachs, along with a prominent former arbitrager at Kidder, were being arraigned in federal court in New York on insider trading charges.    &quot;We were on a way to a nice rally. But the buyers just faded after the news hit the tape. A lot of buy orders were canceled,&quot; said James Andrews, head of institutional trading at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia.    Several sell programs, tied to various strategies using stock-index futures, accelerated the decline. Trading was active and erratic until the closing bell.    The Standard andamp; Poor's 500-stock index fell 1.92 to 275.62, and the New York Stock Exchange composite index lost 0.89 to 157.58. Decliners outnumbered gainers on the Big Board, 850 to 722, as volume rose to 200.4 million shares from 172.4 million shares Wednesday.    Some traders said they were stunned by the news, but some others were blase. Since last November, when Ivan F. Boesky agreed to a $100 million settlement of Securities and Exchange Commission insider trading charges, &quot;Everyone has known that another shoe was going to drop. But this does hurt Wall Street's public image,&quot; said a New York-based stock trader.    At some firms, it was just business as usual. One stock-index futures trader at a New York firm said, &quot;Some people here just looked up from their screens, snickered and then kept on trading.&quot;    The news of more insider trading charges provided yet another excuse for investors to take profits, some market observers said. Hildegard Zagorski at Prudential-Bache Securities said she believes the stock market is due for a consolidation after its rapid rise in the past five weeks. But she expects only a mild one, with the rally resuming quickly.    While blue-chip issues had a rough ride yesterday, some of the smaller capitalization issues had a better time.    In the over-the-counter market, the Nasdaq OTC composite rose 0.93 to 409.18 as volume expanded to 168 million shares from 149.5 million Wednesday. There were 1,225 issues advancing and 1,023 declining.    Investors who bought semiconductor stocks Wednesday afternoon were disappointed yesterday morning. The latest industry data on orders and shipments, released after Wednesday's close, weren't as bullish as Wall Street professionals anticipated. Accordingly, several securities firms removed some of these issues from their recommended lists and others told their clients to sell the stocks.    Texas Instruments fell 3 7/8 to 155 1/8, Motorola dropped 1 3/8 to 48, Advanced Micro Devices lost 1 1/8 to 21 3/8, and National Semiconductor slipped 3/8 to 14 7/8.    In the OTC market, Intel lost 1 7/8 to 36 1/4, LSI Logic dropped 1/4 to 16, and Monolithic Memories fell 5/8 to 17 3/8.    Other technology stocks were mixed.    Apple Computer ran up 2 1/8 to 58 5/8 on reports that the company was telling analysts its second quarter, which ends March 31, would be better than expected. After the market closed, Apple officials said such reports were incorrect. But the company did say, in response to analysts' questions, that January sales were better than expected.    Microsoft gained 5 to 76 3/4, but Ashton-Tate and Lotus Development edged lower in OTC trading.    Minnesota Mining closed up 1/4 at 131 1/4 after a bumpy ride. The stock ran up to 139 after the company said that it planned to announce &quot;a major positive business transaction&quot; at noon EST. Traders bid up the stock, speculating 3M might be planning a major reorganization or selling off an unprofitable unit. After the company said it agreed to buy a Bristol-Myers unit, the stock began to slide. Trading was halted and 3M resumed trading at 131.    Pennzoil closed down 1 at 71 on the Big Board. But the stock traded between 80 and 85 through Jefferies andamp; Co. after news that the Texas state appeals court affirmed all but $2 billion of the $11.1 billion judgment against Texaco that a Houston court entered in December 1985.    Texaco closed down 3/4 at 38 1/2. But the stock traded between 32 and 34 1/4 in the third market.    American Home Products rose 3/4 to 82 1/8. The company said it was discontinuing its efforts to acquire A.H. Robins, which is facing huge liability claims relating to its Dalkon Shield contraceptive product. Robins was halted at 21 1/4 on the Big Board. But it traded between 14 1/2 and 15 1/4 through Jefferies and closed down 6 1/2 at 15 1/2 on the Pacific Stock Exchange.    Drug, publishing and broadcasting stocks broke away from yesterday's downward trend, scoring some gains.    Carter-Wallace continued to run up, sprinting ahead 9 1/2 to 140, and Mentor Corp. jumped 5 3/8 to 40 1/4 in OTC trading. Both companies manufacture condoms, which health officials say could be effective in controlling the spread of AIDS.    &quot;It's a classic case of hyped demand for the stock&quot; because of an expected huge increase in sales for condoms, said David Saks, who follows the drug industry at Morgan Olmstead Kennedy andamp; Gardner.    Lynne Pauls, an analyst at E.F. Hutton, said the stock has been helped by publicity from such experts as the surgeon general, who believes that condoms should be advertised on television.    An initial public offering of Himont was well-received, as the shares traded as high as 32, up from an initial offering price of $28 a share. The shares closed at 31 1/2 as more than 3.7 million changed hands. Himont is the world's largest producer of polypropylene. </TEXT></DOC>
