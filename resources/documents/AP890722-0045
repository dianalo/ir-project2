The request, submitted Friday by 144 deputies of thecenter-right New Democracy Party, was expected to pass in the300-seat Parliament with the support of the 28 deputies of theCommunist-led Coalition of the Left and Progress, which governswith New Democracy.   The proposal accuses Papandreou of ordering taps on thetelephones of President Christos Sartzetakis, political rivals, hisown Cabinet ministers and military officials.   It also charges that three former heads of the Ministry ofTransport and Communications were involved in the allegedeavesdropping.   Papandreou was premier for eight years but his PanhellenicSocialist Movement lost in last month's general elections. NewDemocracy and the Communist-led group agreed to form a short-termcoalition aimed at investigating scandals that occurred duringPapandreou's rule.   New Democracy's proposal to set up a 12-member committee toinvestigate the phone-tapping charges will be discussed by theunicameral Parliament next Thursday.   ``We propose criminal prosecution ... on the accountability ofgovernment members and ministers,'' the proposal said.   Parliament also has ordered an investigation into Papandreou'salleged involvement in a multimillion-dollar financial scandalinvolving fugitive Greek banker George Koskotas.   A 12-member investigative committee was formed Friday toinvestigate the charges.   The Koskotas scandal and other charges of widespead corruptionand wrongdoing led to the fall of Papandreou's government in theJune 18 elections.   The governing coalition says it is carrying out a ``catharsis,''or clean up of government.   Government spokesman Athanassios Kannelopoulos reiterated Fridaythat ``the catharsis will be carried out in such a time period sothat the elections will be held in October.''</TEXT></DOC>
