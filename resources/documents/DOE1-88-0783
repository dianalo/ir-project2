Theauthors describe conditions under which the resistance to the rotationalmotion of the transcription ensemble around the DNA can be large. Insuch cases, the advancing polymerase generates positive supercoils inthe DNA template ahead of it and negative supercoils behind it. Mutualannihilation of the positively and negatively supercoiled regions maybe prevented by anchoring points on the DNA to a large structure, or,in the case of an unanchored plasmid, by the presence of two oppositelyoriented transcription units. In prokaryotes, DNA topoisomerase I preferentiallyremoves negative supercoils and DNA gyrase (topoisomerase II) removespositive ones. The model thus provides an explanation for the experimentallyobserved high degree of negative or positive supercoiling of intracellularpBR322 DNA when DNA topoisomerase I or gyrase is respectively inhibited.They discuss the implications of the module in terms of supercoilingregulation, DNA conformational transitions, and gene regulation in bothprokaryotes and eukaryotes.</TEXT></DOC>
