With bookings worth $2.48 billion _ 42 firm orders from aroundthe globe _ rockets are scheduled to blast off once a monthstarting Sept. 8 for the next 10 months and continue at a pace ofnine launches a year.   They will put into orbit satellites for businesses andgovernments for use in improving communications, weatherforecasting, telephone links or television transmission.   Ariane's commercial and technological success is a source ofpride for France, the rocket's main backer in the 13-nationconsortium.   Above all, it provides a boost to the Europeans' late bid tostake a claim to outer space.   European perseverence in developing a throwaway rocket _ adinosaur in the age of manned space flight _ is sweetened by the``I told you so'' syndrome.   The United States, which was relying exclusively on the spaceshuttle for satellite launches, has not yet recovered from theChallenger disaster Jan. 28, 1986, but it hopes to re-enter thepicture sometime this year with a shuttle launch.   Patrick Baudry, the French astronaut who was a crew member on a1985 U.S. shuttle flight, said Ariane's success should not beoverstated, however.   ``Ariane is just a launcher of satellites,'' he said in atelephone interview.   ``In the end, Ariane performs a mission that the Russians andthe Americans have been capable of for 25 years. It's a technicalsuccess, a commercial success. But there is still a long way to gobefore Europe is a completely adult space nation.''   A latecomer to space, Western Europe has a vision of becoming anindependent space power.   ``The great nations of tomorrow will be those that can bestmaster space,'' said Baudry, echoing official thinking. ``Thesuccess of Ariane is essential for more ambitious programs. Itsymbolizes the mastery of technology.''   Major European projects include an Ariane 5 rocket capable oflifting a manned space shuttle, Hermes, into orbit a decade fromnow and participation in the U.S. manned space station project.   Not all European Space Agency (ESA) member nations areenthusiastic about the plans.   Britain dissented at a ministerial meeting in November of the13-nation agency, which also is made up of Austria, Belgium,Denmark, West Germany, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway,Spain, Sweden and Switzerland.   Britain's industry and trade minister, Kenneth Clarke, calledthe European plans to put men in space a ``hugely expensiveindustrial frolic'' with ``rather too much smacking of me-tooism.''   For now, the competition is on the ground, and it is growingfierce.   President Reagan's decision to forbid commercial launches onfuture shuttle flights has given birth to a private U.S. spaceindustry. Once reliant on the National Aeronautics and SpaceAdministration (NASA), major U.S. rocket builders must now competewith a slick European sales machine that has been in place eightyears.   The Soviet Union also has been wooing commercial customers forspace launches through a new organization called Glavkosmos. Withslick brochures and film advertisements, Glavkosmos proposes tolaunch communications satellites and other payloads from foreigncountries aboard its powerful rocket booster, Proton.   The first Soviet commercial launch earlier this year sent up anIndian satellite.   Soviet space officials, however, say they are having troubledrumming up business because of Western governments' restrictionson the export of high technology equipment to the Soviet Union.   The restrictions discourage many potential customers from makinga deal with the Soviets.   A child of the European Space Agency, the Ariane 1 through 4series of rockets has been sold, financed and launched by ESA'scommercial spinoff, Arianespace, since 1980.   Billed as ``the world's first commercial space transportcompany,'' Arianespace is devoted to selling space on rockets andplacing its clients' satellites into geostationary transfer orbit,about 22,000 miles from Earth.   In 1987, Arianespace, a French company with 50 Europeanshareholders, who are mostly governments and state-run companies,reported a 44 percent increase in profits over 1986.   Sam Mihara, director of new business for the U.S. McDonnellDouglas Delta Program, credits Arianespace with providing theworld's only available launcher after the Challenger accident.   ``But a lot of the success of Ariane was unique to thesituation,'' he said.   ``I consider Ariane as the new kid on the block,'' he said,noting that Delta rockets have been launched for 28 years. ``Whatmight be new (for us) is a piece of paper. Previously, ourcustomers were buying with NASA. NASA was the sales agent.''   McDonnell Douglas and its Delta rocket, General Dynamics withits Atlas Centaur and Martin Marietta with the giant Titan are thethree rocket builders now at the heart of America's fledglingprivate space launch industry.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
