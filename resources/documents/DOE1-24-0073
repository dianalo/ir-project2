Two units belong to this division: the Geothermal SurveyDepartment and the Geothermal Technology Development Office. The GeothermalSurvey Department performs survey concerning the presence of geothermalresources, assessment of the influence of geothermal energy developmenton environment, establishment of new exploration technology for usabledeep geothermal energy resources, development of geothermal reservoirevaluation techniques aimed to develop techniques for estimating theappropriate scale of power generation in the development area, and liabilityguarantee for geothermal energy development funds. The Geothermal TechnologyDevelopment Office performs research and development of new various technologies,including those for binary-cycle power generation plants which can makefull use of hydrothermal resources affluently present in Japan, researchand development of collection and injection systems which can utilizenon-volcanic hydrothermal resources present deep underground around urbanareas for hot-water supply and heating services in local communities,and technical development of power generation systems utilizing hot dryrock. The number of areas in which development has started is 21. Thebudgets assigned to these two units are as follows: 13.2 billion yenfor fiscal 1985 and 12.108 billion yen for fiscal 1986 assigned to theGeothermal Survey Department; 2.11 billion yen for fiscal 1985 and 2.61billion yen for fiscal 1987 assigned to the Geothermal Technology DevelopmentOffice.
