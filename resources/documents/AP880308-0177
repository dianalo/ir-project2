SCHMID</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Higher stamp prices won't take effect untilnext month, postal officials said Tuesday after postponing a finaldecision on the effective date of the new rates.   The board of governors of the U.S. Postal Service will hold aspecial meeting March 22 to discuss putting the new rates intoeffect.   ``Although no definite decision on an effective date for rateshas been scheduled, the board has set April 3 as the target date togive mailers advance notice to plan for the new rates,'' the agencysaid in a statement issued following its meeting Tuesday.   Under the law, the agency has to give 10 days notice once itvotes to impose new rates, so a vote on March 22 could get the newprices in force by April 3, which is also Easter this year.   The new prices, recommended by the independent Postal RateCommission last Friday following 10 months of deliberation, callfor a sweeping series of increases averaging more than 17 percent.Included would be a 25-cent first-class rate.   At Tuesday's meeting, new Postmaster General Anthony Frank saidhe would like to restore some of the recently cut postal serviceswhen higher stamp prices take effect, but he was concerned aboutthe costs involved.   Post Office window openings and sorting hours were cut inJanuary in an effort to comply with congressional spending limits.   The higher postage rates are not connected to those cuts, havingbeen proposed nearly a year ago to help compensate for the agency'soverall budgetary problems.   But, Frank admitted, explaining to the public the reasons forreduced services at the same time rates are rising ``is a verydifficult message to get out.''   Frank said expanded window hours at some offices are beingconsidered, at least to help out during the changeover from one setof rates to another.   In addition, he said many offices will stay open until midnightApril 15 to accept last-minute tax forms.   The Postal Service, meanwhile, announced that it is offeringtelephone sales of stamps nationwide during the transition to thenew rates.   Callers will be able to use Visa and MasterCard credit cards toorder the new undenominated ``E'' stamps, with the stamps to bemailed out once the final decision is made on the new rate.   Customers who want to order the non-denominated stamps can doso, 24 hours a day, by calling 1-800-STAMP24. The minimum orderwill be $12.50 plus a $2 service charge.   Sales of stamps by telephone have been tested in eight citiessince last fall, with total sales now of more than $2 million.   In addition to the new ``E'' stamps, which can be used only forletters within the United States, some post offices still havesupplies of 25-cent stamps featuring a portrait of writer JackLondon.   In addition, consumers with supplies of 22-cent stamps will beable to purchase stamps to make up the difference between those andthe new rates.   A new 3-cent stamp showing a Conestoga wagon was released Feb.29, and some supplies of the 3-cent stamp showing Dr. Paul DudleyWhite may also be available. Post offices also should have 2-centstamps featuring Mary Lyon and 1-cent stamps with the likeness ofMargaret Mitchell.</TEXT></DOC>
