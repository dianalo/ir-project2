The company blamed high production costsand low commodity prices.   &quot;In the current price. . . .environment, I can't see thejustification for mounting a high-cost exploration program,&quot;said Arden Haynes, Imperial's chairman and chief executiveofficer. He added that he expects capital spending onImperial's upstream oil and gas exploration and developmentactivities to remain well below historic levels of C$100million to C$120 million annually and closer to the C$50million level during the next few years.</LP><TEXT>   Instead, Mr. Haynes said that Imperial, 70%-owned by ExxonCorp., will be relying more on its downstream oil refiningand marketing operations to help generate profits in thecoming years.   &quot;Downstream {operations are} going to have to carry theload,&quot; he said.   Historically, the bulk of Imperial's earnings have comefrom its oil and gas production activities in western Canada.In 1990, the company reported net income of C$431 millionfrom its upstream activities, compared with a downstream lossof C$42 million. Last year, profit from oil and gasproduction slipped to C$277 million while, after a change inaccounting methods, the refining and marketing operations hadC$123 million net income.   But Imperial's conventional oil and gas production isexpected to drop steadily during the next few years. Althoughtotal production is expected to remain flat, analysts say adrop of 5% to 7% in production of conventional, premium-gradeoil will be offset by slightly more production oflowerpriced, low-margin heavy crude.   The company doesn't have a good inventory of low-costsupplies coming onstream soon, and Mr. Haynes acknowledgesthat Imperial's costs to find and produce oil are relativelyhigh.   Imperial Oil is counting on its recently announcedrestructuring proposals to help boost profitability at itsdownstream operations, Mr. Haynes said. As reported, thecompany plans to sell or close about 1,000 retail outlets andeliminate 1,700 jobs. It will decide early next year whetherto close two of its five Canadian refineries.   Company officials say they are &quot;comfortable&quot; withanalysts' estimates that Imperial will report net of C$1.80to C$2 a share in 1992, compared with 84 Canadian cents ashare for 1991. Pretax cost savings of as much as C$334million this year could boost the company's bottom line asmuch as C$1 a share, they say.</TEXT></DOC>
