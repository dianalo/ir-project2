The French group has spun itself a web of cross-borderalliances in recent years through a series of takeovers andpartnerships that have made it the world's second-largeststeel producer after Japan's Nippon Steel Corp.</LP><TEXT>   Usinor's latest move came last week when it announcedplans for a friendly takeover of New York-based EdgcombCorp., one of the biggest steel-trading concerns in the U.S.,for an undisclosed amount.   Edgcomb is the latest in a string of acquisitions byUsinor in the U.S., where it is now the biggest producer ofstainless steel and has reached a critical mass in long steelproducts.   With a solid U.S. trading and distribution network nowunder its belt, analysts say, Usinor is now poised to carveitself a niche in flat products, the steel industry'smainstay.   LTV Corp., another large U.S. steelmaker, disclosed a fewmonths ago that Usinor Sacilor had indicated it wasinterested in discussing the acquisition of a minorityinterest in LTV's steel unit, which produced 8.4 million tonsof raw steel and had revenue of $4.1 billion in 1989.Officials at the French group say the talks remain at a verypreliminary stage, however.   But Francis Mer, chairman of the steel group, rejectssuggestions that Usinor has delusions of grandeur and saysUsinor isn't expanding for the sake of size alone. &quot;If oneday we become the world's biggest steel producer it won't bebecause we set out to do so,&quot; he said in an interview.   Mr. Mer doesn't believe that Usinor will ever catch upwith its Japanese competitor. Although Nippon Steel claims tohave production capacity of 28 million tons, compared withUsinor's 23 million tons, the figure is nearer to 40 milliontons if all Nippon's affiliated companies are included.   Usinor Sacilor's biggest foreign takeover to date was itsacquisition last year of a controlling stake in WestGermany's Saarstahl in a move that made the French group thesecond-biggest German producer after Thyssen AG.   Usinor's expansion plans got a boost this week, when theEuropean Community Commission cleared the way for Usinor andBritish Steel PLC of the U.K. to expand further intospecialist markets. Usinor's Sollac unit will be allowed topurchase two units from their parent company, Anglo-Frenchpackaging specialist CMB S.A.   &quot;Usinor reflects the imperialistic style that appears tobe in vogue in France at the present time,&quot; commented PeterDupont, a steel-industry analyst with UBS-Philips andamp; Drew Ltd.of London, referring to the wave of foreign takeovers byFrench state-controlled industrial concerns in recent months.   Usinor's chief executive says he would prefer to be in aposition to issue common shares rather than nonvotingsecurities, as many nationalized companies have done inrecent years.   Analysts say it's significant that during the difficultyears, Usinor Sacilor was able to maintain its expenditure onimproving productivity when private-owned concerns couldn't.   &quot;Part of the reason may be that with the state's backing,Usinor could take out loans on more-favorable terms than itscompetitors. This raises the question of whether or not theplaying field was level,&quot; comments Mr. Dupont of Philips andamp;Drew.   Vincent Mordrel, an analyst with Parisian brokerage DLPJames Capel, points out that unlike steel companies in theU.S., Usinor didn't have to worry about shareholder reactionto quarterly earnings reports.   Usinor Sacilor returned to profitability in 1988 after 12straight years of losses, but Mr. Mer says it's unlikely thatthe 1990 earnings performance will match that of 1989, whenconsolidated net profit after payments to minority interestsclimbed to 7.592 billion francs ($1.41 billion) from 4.633billion a year earlier.   He explained that steel demand was boosted artificiallylast year by stockbuilding linked to the inability ofproducers to meet rapidly rising demand. Right now there's astock depletion trend that has pushed production levels belowthose of actual consumption, but this phenomenon istemporary, and production should start moving in line withdemand next year.   Mr. Mer says steel demand in Europe is projected to riseby between 2% and 3% annually in volume terms over the nextfour or five years, provided that interest rates don't risesignificantly.</TEXT></DOC>
