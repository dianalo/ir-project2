The differentexperiments were designed to address specific problems and give new informationabout: (1) Rotational damping from triple gamma correlations by higherselectivity on rotational transitions. (2) Shape evolutions and fluctuationsat finite temperatures as function of spin. (I/sub max/ {similar_to}30h) by GDR measurements. (3) Shape evolution and fluctuations at finitetemperature as function of spin (I/sub max/ {similar_to} 60h) and alsotest for superdeformed shapes by angular correlation effects. (4) Theshape of the nuclear potential at a temperature of T = 3.5 MeV, wherethermal equilibrium still may be expected before the GDR decay, by accuratemeasurements of the width. Does Motional Narrowing effect the width?(5) The limits of collective motion at even higher temperatures up toT {similar_to} 7MeV where nuclei still are observed with full momentumtransfers.</TEXT></DOC>
