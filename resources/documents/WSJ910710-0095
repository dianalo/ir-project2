Executives and political action committees affiliated withthe buyers of about 100 failed savings and loan associationsin controversial 1988 transactions contributed at least $2.8million to candidates running for the presidency, Congress orother offices, said the Center for Study of Responsive Law, aRalph Nader-affiliated group. The contributions all occurredduring the 1987-88 election cycle.</LP><TEXT>   For example, Ronald Perelman, the New York financier andchairman of MacAndrews andamp; Forbes Holdings Inc., which reaped$1.8 billion in tax breaks from Sandamp;L purchases, contributed$6,000 himself to a wide field of presidential candidates ofboth parties. President Bush and Robert Dole each received$500, while Democrats Joseph Biden, Michael Dukakis, RichardGephardt, Albert Gore and Gary Hart each received $1,000.   In total, Mr. Perelman and his affiliates contributed$191,250 to Democratic and Republican candidates during 1987and 1988.   The study didn't allege that elected officials leaned onthe thrift regulators to favor campaign contributors in thethrift sales. But the study &quot;gives people an understanding ofhow a system dominated by special interests works,&quot; saidJoseph Belluck, one of the researchers. &quot;There is certainlythe appearance that some of these campaign contributions weredesigned to influence or gain access to elected officials.&quot;   A spokesman for Mr. Perelman declined to comment.   On the Senate Banking Committee, eight members receivedmore than $10,000 each from eventual buyers of the Sandamp;Ls.Committee Chairman Donald Riegle (D., Mich.) received themost, $39,000, from these contributors. Two senators who weredefeated, Republicans Chic Hecht of Nevada and David Karnesof Nebraska, received $34,499 and $31,850, respectively. Sen.Phil Gramm (R., Texas) was next with $26,600.   On the House Banking Committee, eight members receivedmore than $10,000 from the Sandamp;L buyers, led by former chairmanFernand St Germain (D., R.I.), defeated in 1988, and Rep.Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.), who each received $19,000.   Most of the Sandamp;Ls were sold in late 1988, when the Sandamp;Linsurance fund was out of money, and regulators could onlypromise future assistance payments and tax breaks to attractbuyers to insolvent Sandamp;Ls. Many of the transactions drew somuch wrath from Congress that thrift regulators are nowattempting to wring savings from them.   The Resolution Trust Corp., formed two years ago toliquidate failed Sandamp;Ls, has prepaid about $6 billion inhigh-interest-bearing assistance notes to the thrift buyers.That represents about $600 million in interest costs savings,the agency says. It will prepay at least another $2.8 billionin such notes before Sept. 30, an official said.</TEXT></DOC>
