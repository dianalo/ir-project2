Baker III says theSoviet threat to stop destroying its SS-23 missiles would violatean arms control treaty and appeared to be part of a publicitycampaign to divide NATO.   The Soviets agreed to destroy the SS-23s, along with five othertypes of missiles, in the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Force Treatythat was signed in December 1987 and went into effect last June,said Baker.   ``This is a matter that was specifically negotiated when the INFTreaty was negotiated,'' he said.   ``The elimination of the SS-23s on the part of the Soviet Union... was debated back and forth for quite some time. The Sovietsresponded in effect that they would agree to eliminate thesemissiles, and now they are doing so,'' Baker said Sunday on theCBS-TV interview program, ``Face the Nation.''   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze, visiting Bonn onSaturday, warned that if Washington did not drop plans to modernizeits short-range Lance missile, the Soviet Union would respond bydeveloping a new short-range weapon or by retaining the SS-23s,which have a range near the 300-mile limit imposed by the treaty.   The Soviet Union has deployed the SS-23@Spider since 1985 as areplacement to the 1960s vintage SCUD missile, and has about 75Spiders in the Soviet Union and East Germany, according to thePentagon. The INF treaty calls for the Kremlin to destroy all theSS-23s by October 1989.   The INF pact required the superpowers to destroy all missileswith ranges of 300 to 3,000 miles, but did not cover the Lance,which has a shorter range.   The United States has deferred until 1992 plans to modernize andreplace the 88 Lance missiles it has in West Germany, but hasresisted West German and Soviet pressure to begin immediatenegotiations on that class of weapons.   Baker repeated the U.S. position not to negotiate the reductionor elimination of short-range weapons with the Soviets untilcompletion of talks designed to reduced the significant Warsaw Pactadvantage in conventional arms in Europe.   ``What they'd much prefer to see is the entire denuclearizationof Europe,'' Baker said.   Shevardnadze's comment, Baker said, could be seen as a publicrelations ploy designed to weaken the North Atlantic TreatyOrganization.   ``It would be a terrible mistake if we fall into the trap ofplaying politics with Western security,'' he said. ``And theRussians would love, dearly love to see that happen. They'd love tosee us do that and start trying to play that game.   ``We don't need to be concerning ourselves with short-rangepublic opinion victories.''   Baker welcomed the announcement by Kremlin leader Mikhail S.Gorbachev that the Soviet Union would remove 500 short-rangemissiles from Europe, but urged Moscow to eliminate more of theweapons, in which the Soviets enjoy a 16-to-one advantage over NATO.   ``The Soviets are coming our way,'' said Baker. ``For a longtime we've been calling on them to unilaterally reduce some oftheir short-range nuclear weapons the way the NATO alliance has.''   Over the past decade, he said, NATO has destroyed 2,400short-range nuclear weapons without fanfare, whereas Gorbachevannounced only that the Soviets were removing 500 missiles fromEastern Europe into European portions of the Soviet Union, withinaccess of the potential East-West battlefield.   ``So we say, we say it's a good step, but it's a very small oneand a very modest one,'' said Baker.   The Soviets have been modernizing their short-range missiles forthe past 10 years, Baker's deputy, Lawrence Eagleburger, said in aseparate interview on the ABC-TV program, ``This Week with DavidBrinkley.''</TEXT></DOC>
