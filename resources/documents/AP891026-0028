The measure designed to protect as many as 750,000 exiles fromdeportation was approved 258-162 on Wednesday and goes to theSenate.   ``These are people who need our help and we are in a position tohelp them,'' Rep. Joe Moakley, D-Mass., said in urging support.   The bill would suspend for three years deportation of illegalaliens who fled El Salvador, Nicaragua and China if they were inthe United States when the measure went into effect and if theyregistered within nine months.   It also would establish a system for extending temporary statusto citizens of additional countries beset by armed conflict andnatural disaster.   Approval came despite warnings from opponents that it wouldencourage job-hungry Central Americans to come north in the guiseof political exiles.   ``It isn't right to say to American workers that we are going totake your job away from you and give it to people who came here totake your job away from you in the first place,'' said Rep. BobWalker, R-Pa.   Moakley noted that the measure has support from the AFL-CIO anda number of large labor unions.   Proponents said 70,000 Salvadorans and 30,000 Nicaraguancivilians have been killed by civil war over the last decade andthat 10,000 democracy demonstrators have been jailed in China.   ``I think its in our interest to have Nicaraguans andSalvadorans living in the open rather than maintaining anunderground existence,'' Rep. Hamilton Fish, R-N.Y., told the House.   However, Rep. Helen Bentley, R-Md., cited estimates that theprice of operating the program could reach $260 million over twoyears.   ``I can tell you that my constituents will not abide by it,''she said.</TEXT></DOC>
