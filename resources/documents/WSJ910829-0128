Forthe fifth-grade boys in a village school, the world of theirfathers has vanished in a pall of defeat. Except that theconquerors turn out to be like no other conquerors inhistory, benevolent and generous idealists who wear easysmiles, dispense gum and chocolate. Before the conquerorsarrive the boys exchange intelligence about the size of theAmericans' sex organs, which, they have heard, are huge,possibly the size of beer bottles. Mostly, the arrival of theAmericans is backdrop to a skillfully threaded melodramaabout a small group of villagers at war's end. For directorMasahiro Shinoda, whose spent his childhood years willing todie for his emperor, everything changed with the coming ofthe American GIs, when, as he says, &quot;My heart was snared byAmerica.&quot; As this film shows, in its subtle and affectingway, the romance was an enduring one.   -- 9-11 p.m. EDT, on PBS. PBS air dates and times vary socheck local listings.                                                                                                                                Tuesday, Sept. 3                     Casting the First Stone                                                                                                          Film maker Julie Gustafson spends a lot of time at theoutset of this work delivering the news that many people holdstrongly opposing views on abortion. Her film, fortunately,turns out to be far more penetrating than this beginning, asit follows the lives of six women heavily involved in theabortion controversy. It does, however, bog down with somefrequency. Not every exchange of fatuities taking placeoutside abortion clinics is, after all, worth recording thefirst time, much less a second or third time -- but still,the film's drama is considerable. It cuts past the movements'cheerleaders and famous faces, past rhetoric and rage, toprovide a creditable, if not always appealing, accountingfrom both sides. That is no small accomplishment.   -- 10-11 p.m. EDT, on PBS.                                                                                                                             Final Verdict                                                                                                          Besides Glenn Ford, the chief distinction of this work,based on a novel by the newspaperwoman Adela Rogers St.Johns, is its lushly detailed period evocation of Los Angelesin the 1920s. Loosely built around the career of the criminallawyer Earl Rogers, the film ambles engagingly around thelegal and ethical questions it tries, not very hard, toraise. Mr. Ford's appearance as Rogers's minister father isbrief, but it is a cameo well spent. The minister is appalledas he sits watching his son (Treat Willams) win an acquittalfor a verminous thug who is in fact guilty of murder. Mr.Ford is splendidly convincing when summoning his son todeclare the acquittal &quot;a contemptible victory for evil.&quot; Tobe sure the action quickly hightails it from debate tomore-colorful arenas such as the house of ill repute wherelawyer Rogers was wont to submerge his sorrows over hisfather's lack of regard for him. The script has tendenciestoward the literate, which is better than nothing, the storymoves, and the unlawyerly Mr. Williams in the end brings offa persuasive performance at the bar -- the one in court andthe other kind.   -- 8-10 p.m. EDT, on TNT.                                                                                                                          Wednesday, Sept. 11                     Lightning Field                                                                                                          The publicist's synopsis tells the story. &quot;CentralAmerican Indians steal newborn infant for ritual sacrifice.&quot;But not the whole story, since, as everyone in ourmulticultural age knows, Indians wouldn't do such things ifthey were not driven to it by the crimes of the U.S.government. Everyone also knows that, without the theme ofthe U.S. as the evil empire and chief oppressor of thedisinherited of the earth, hardly any made-for-TV movieswould get written. As a wonderfully pure indicator of thelimitless inspiration TV scriptwriters and similar creativeminds keep finding in this theme, this film, starring anaddled looking Polly Bergen, is worth a look. Its mostmemorable utterance undoubtedly comes from the leader of thistribe, which practices human blood sacrifices. He tells themother of the tribe's newest born offspring, &quot;Your son has arich heritage.&quot;   -- 9-11 EDT, on USA.                                                                                                                      Attempted Murder: Confrontation                                                                                                          This presentation records the encounter between a20-year-old black youth and the dedicated teacher, alsoblack, whom he beat nearly to death in a Bronx schoolyard afew years back. The teacher (so maimed he can no longerteach) is, in the end, less able to carry off theconversation then his attacker. A lot is packed into thisinvariably gripping half-hour -- a lot that is hard to watchand harder still to contemplate.   -- 11-11:30 p.m. EDT, on HBO.</TEXT></DOC>
