The title and number of the Federal Assistance Program to which this noticeapplies are: Title_Commodity Loan and Purchases; Number 10.051, as setforth in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance. It has been determined that the Regulatory Flexibility Act is not applicableto this notice since neither the Agricultural Stabilization and ConservationService (ASCS) nor the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) are requiredby 5 U.S.C. 553 or any provision of law to publish a notice of proposedrulemaking with respect to the subject matter of this notice. This notice of determination is issued in accordance with the AgriculturalAdjustment Act of 1938, as amended (the ``1938 Act'') and the AgriculturalAct of 1949, as amended (the ``1949 Act''), in order to announce for the1988 marketing year for flue-cured tobacco the following: 1. The amount of domestic manufacturers' intentions; 2. The amount of the average exports for the 1985, 1986, and 1987 cropyears; 4. The amount of adjustment needed to maintain loan stocks at the reservestock level;5. The amount of the national marketing quota;6. The national average yield goal; 7. The national acreage allotment; 8. The national acreage reserve:A. For establishing acreage allotments for new farms, and B. For making corrections and adjusting inequities in old farms;9. The national acreage factor;10. The national yield factor; and 11. The price support level. The determinations set forth in this notice have been made on the basisof the latest available statistics of the Federal Government. <ITAG tagnum="84">Marketing Quotas</ITAG>Section 317(a)(1) of the 1938 Act provides, in part, that the nationalmarketing quota for a marketing year for flue-cured tobacco is the quantityof such tobacco that is not more than 103 percent nor less than 97 percentof the total of: (1) The amount of flue-cured tobacco that domestic manufacturersof cigarettes estimate they intend to purchase on U.S. auction marketsor from producers, (2) the average quantity exported annually from theU.S. during the three marketing years immediately preceding the marketingyear for which the determination is being made, and (3) the quantity, ifany, necessary to adjust loan stocks to the reserve stock level. Section317(a)(1)(C) further provides that, with respect to the 1986 through 1989marketing years, any reduction in the national marketing quota being determinedshall not exceed six percent of the previous year's national marketingquota. The ``reserve stock level'' is defined in section 301(b)(14)(C)of the 1938 Act as the greater of 100 million pounds or 15 percent of thenational marketing quota for flue-cured tobacco for the marketing yearimmediately preceding the marketing year for which the level is being determined.Section 320A of the 1938 Act provides that all domestic manufacturers ofcigarettes with more than 1 percent of U.S. cigarette production and salesshall submit to the Secretary a statement of purchase intentions for the1988 crop of flue-cured tobacco by December 1, 1987. Six such manufacturerswere required to submit such a statement for the 1988 crop and the totalof their intended purchases for the 1988 crop was 441 million pounds. For the years prior to 1986, industry officials noted that significantamounts of both domestic and foreign-grown burley tobaccos blended withdomestic flue-cured tobacco were reported to the Bureau of Census as flue-curedtobacco exports. Census recorded exports of flue-cured totaled 435.0 millionpounds, farm sales-weight, for the 1985-86 year; however, the USDA adjustednumber more accurately reflects actual exports. At the request of the Bureau of Census, exporters have enhanced the accuracyof their declaration. It appears that due to shifts among certain exportcategories beginning in 1986, Census data are now significantly more accurate.Because of this, actual Census data was used for 1986-87. Accordingly,the three-year average of exports is 388 million pounds. This is basedon adjusted 1985 exports of 376.1 million pounds, 1986 Census-reportedexports of 393.3 million pounds, and USDA-projected 1987 exports of 395million pounds. In accordance with section 301(b)(14)(C) of the 1938 Act, the reserve stocklevel is the greater of 100 million pounds or 15 percent of the 1987 marketingquota for flue-cured tobacco. The national marketing quota for the 1987crop year was 707 million pounds (52 FR 12947). Accordingly, the reservestock level for use in determining the 1988 marketing quota for flue-curedtobacco is 106 million pounds. As of December 2, the Flue-Cured Tobacco Stabilization Corporation hadin its inventory 157 million pounds (excluding pre-1985 stocks committedto be purchased by manufacturers and covered by deferred sales). Accordingly,the adjustment to maintain loan stocks at the reserve supply level is adecrease of 51 million pounds. The total of the three marketing quota components for the 1988-89 marketingyear is 778 million pounds. Section 317 of the 1938 Act further providesthat the Secretary may increase or decrease the total by 3 percent. Toensure against the development of an oversupply situation, the Secretaryexercised this discretionary authority to decrease the three-componenttotal by three percent. Accordingly, the national marketing quota for themarketing year beginning July 1, 1988 for flue-cured tobacco is 755 millionpounds. Section 317(a) of the 1938 Act sets forth the manner in which the flue-curedtobacco national average yield goal is established. Section 317(a) wasamended by the Agricultural Reconciliation Act of 1987 to remove the requirementthat such goal be redetermined at 5-year intervals using the previous 5years' moving national average yield. Accordingly, it has been determinedthat the national average yield goal for the 1988-89 marketing year willbe 1989 pounds per acre.In accordance with section 317(a)(3) of the 1938 Act, the national acreageallotment for the 1988 crop of flue-cured tobacco is determined to be 379,587.73acres, which is the result of dividing the national marketing quota bythe national average yield goal.In accordance with section 317(e) of the 1938 Act, the Secretary is authorizedto establish a national reserve from the national acreage allotment inan amount equivalent to not more than 3 percent of the national acreageallotment for the purpose of making corrections in farm acreage allotments,adjusting for inequities, and for establishing allotments for new farms.The Secretary has determined that a national reserve for the 1988 cropof flue-cured tobacco of 360 acres is adequate for these purposes.<ITAG tagnum="84">Price Support</ITAG>Price support is required to be made available for each crop of a kindof tobacco for which quotas are in effect, or for which marketing quotashave not been disapproved by producers, at a level which is determinedin accordance with a formula prescribed in section 106 of the 1949 Act.With respect to the 1988 crop of flue-cured tobacco, the level of supportis determined in accordance with sections 106 (d) and (f) of the 1949 Act.Section 106(f)(4) of the 1949 Act provides that the level of support forthe 1988 crop of flue-cured tobacco shall be: (1) The level in cents perpound at which the 1987 crop of flue-cured tobacco was supported, plusor minus, respectively, (2) an adjustment of not less than 65 percent normore than 100 percent of the total, as determined by the Secretary aftertaking into consideration the supply of the kind of tobacco involved inrelation to demand, of:(A) 66.7 percent of the amount by which:(I) The average price received by producers for flue-cured tobacco on theUnited States auction markets, as determined by the Secretary, during the5 marketing years immediately preceding the marketing year for which thedetermination is being made, excluding the year in which the average pricewas the highest and the year in which the average price was the lowestin such period, is greater or less than(II) The average price received by producers for flue-cured tobacco onthe United States auction markets, as determined by the Secretary, duringthe 5 marketing years immediately preceding the marketing year prior tothe marketing year for which the determination is being made, exludingthe year in which the average price was the highest and the year in whichthe average price was the lowest in such period; and(B) 33.3 percent of the change, expressed as a cost per pound of tobacco,in the index of prices paid by tobacco producers from January 1 to December31 of the calendar year immediately preceding the year in which the determinationis made.For the purpose of calculating the market-price component of the supportlevel, the 1949 Act provides that the average market price be reduced 25cents per pound for the 1985 marketing year and 30 cents per pound forprior marketing years.The difference between the two 5-year averages (the difference between(A)(I) and (A)(II) is 1.4 cents per pound. The difference in the cost indexfrom January 1 to December 31, 1987 is 0.5 cents per pound. Applying thesecomponents to the price support formula (1.4 cents per pound, two-thirdsweight; 0.5 cents per pound, one-third weight) result in an increase inthe price support level of 1.1 cents per pound. However, section 106 furtherprovides that the Secretary may limit the change in the price support levelto no less than 65 percent of the change that otherwise would have occurredif an oversupply exists for such kind of tobacco. Because the total supplyof flue-cured tobacco is sufficient for about 2.7 years, use with 2.4 yearsbeing considered normal, the Secretary has determined that supplies offlue-cured tobacco are excessive. Accordingly, the 1988 crop of flue-curedtobacco will be supported at 144.2 cents per pound, 0.7 cent higher thanin 1987.The level of support for the 1988 crop of flue-cured tobacco and the nationalmarketing quota for the 1988 flue-cured marketing year were announced onDecember 15, 1987 by the Secretary of Agriculture.
