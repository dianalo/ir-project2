The group, the Foundation on Economic Trends, said the ``DeepFire'' program ``represents a unique threat to international peace.''   Citing a little known provision of federal law, the foundationfiled a petition with Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci,requesting ``the preparation of a full, complete, detailed andpublic Arms Control Impact Statement for the chemical warfareprogram called `Deep Fire.'''   ``This program is designed to examine deep-strike delivery ofchemical weapons, including cruise-missile delivery of chemicalwarfare agents. The program represents a dangerous escalation of thechemical warfare arms race.''   The petition was filed by Jeremy Rifkin, the foundation'spresident, who added: ``If the incoming administration truly wishesto stop the proliferation of chemical weapons, as was pledged duringthe campaign, it should immediately eliminate this program.''   According to Rifkin, recently declassified House AppropriationsCommittee transcripts of a March 11, 1987, hearing contain thefollowing from the Pentagon:   ``Alternative long-range standoff chemical weapons beingconsidered are the Army Tactical Missile System; powered GBU-15glide weapon; air-launched cruise missile; ground-launched cruisemissile; sea-launched cruise missile; Tomahawk, Harpoon and AdvancedInterdiction Weapon System.''   According to the group, the federal Arms Control and DisarmamentAct requires the Pentagon to prepare an impact statement whenever itbegins work on a ``program involving technology with potentialmilitary application or weapons systems which ... may havesignificant impact on arms control and disarmament policy ornegotiations.''   The foundation asserted no such impact statement had beenprepared for the ``Deep Fire'' program.   ``Clearly, research into deep-strike delivery systems forchemical warfare agents could dramatically alter strategic optionsfor chemical warfare use. `Deep Fire's' impacts on disarmamentpolicy and negotiations must be fully assessed.''   The Pentagon said Wednesday it did not know of any programcode-named ``Deep Fire,'' but acknowledged it had been conducting``low-level studies of standoff chemical weapons since beingdirected by Congress to do so in 1985.''   ``There is no program to put chemical weapons on cruisemissiles,'' said Lt. Col. Rick Oborn, a Pentagon spokesman. ``Andwe're not sure where this `Deep Fire' name comes from.   ``We have been told by Congress to continue low-level studies ofwhat chemical weapons might follow (the current generation), andthat's what we're doing.''   Given the nature of the work, Oborn said it was not clear the lawrequiring an impact analysis should apply in this situation.   The United States, citing production by the Soviet Union,recently began making a new generation of toxic chemical weapons.The weapons being made under that program, however, are eithershort-range artillery rounds or a bomb for delivery by an airplane.   Putting a chemical warhead on a cruise missile would make itpossible to deliver such a weapon more than 1,000 miles into enemyterritory and to launch it either from the air, sea or ground.   The Foundation on Economic Trends is an environmental group thatlong has focused its attention on the dangers of biological researchand genetic engineering.   The group has enjoyed legal success against the Pentagon in thepast, succeeding in recent years in blocking construction of a newaerosol biological warfare laboratory in Utah and forcingpreparation of an environmental impact study covering variousbiological research programs.</TEXT></DOC>
