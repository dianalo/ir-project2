Cela, 73, was cited by the Swedish Academy for his ``rich andintensive prose, which with restrained compassion forms achallenging vision of man's vulnerability.''   Cela was the fifth Spaniard to win the Nobel Prize inliterature. He said he felt he shared the award with many otherSpanish and Latin American writers.   ``For me this is something I`m very proud of,'' Cela toldSpanish National Radio from his home in Guadalajara, Spain. ``Ioffer it to all of literature in Spanish. I believe that otherauthors, Spanish and Latin American, who write in Spanish couldalso have won it for the same reasons as I, but, in the end, I wonit, and I'm very, very happy.''   Cela's best known work is the 1942 novel ``The Family of PascualDuarte,'' in which he created a new literary style known as``tremendismo,'' emphasizing violence and grotesque imagery.   The novel, a first-person account of a murderer awaitingexecution, was banned in Spain but established Cela's reputation asa writer. It was considered the most important postwar novel andset a new direction for Spanish literature toward concise and soberwriting.   Cela's masterpiece is considered ``The Hive,'' from 1951, whichcaptures three days in the life of Madrid four years after thecivil war.   Cela has written 10 novels among his 70 works of travelogs,short stories and poetry.   The Swedish Academy called him ``the leading figure in Spain'sliterary renewal during the postwar era.''   ``Cela is a restless spirit,'' who often expresses himself ``inan old Spanish tradition of hilarious grotesqueness,'' it said.   Sture Allen, the Academy's secretary, called Cela ``provocativeand innovative'' in both his form and subject matter.   ``The Family of Pascual Duarte'' was probably the most widelyread Spanish novel since ``Don Quixote,'' the Academy said. It alsosingled out as ``a sensation'' his 1969 novel ``San Camilo,'' whichdescribes the weeks before the outbreak of civil war.   Cela was the first Spaniard to win the Nobel since 1977, when itwas awarded to poet Vicente Aleixandre. Cela was chosen from about150 candidates, Allen said. The prize this year is worth about$463,000.   As publisher of the literary magazine ``Papeles de SonArmadans'' from 1956 to 1979, Cela also was credited for providinga forum for young opposition writers during the ``years ofhardship,'' a reference to the dictatorship of Gen. FranciscoFranco.   His writing ``broadened the range of Spanish writing'' andwidely influenced Latin American literature, Allen said afterreading the citation to reporters at the Academy's 18th centuryheadquarters.   Cela was born May 11, 1916, in the town of Iria Flavia to amiddle class family that counted among its forebearers both Spanisharistocrats and English pirates.   His medical studies were interrupted by the 1936-39 Civil War.Suffering from pulmonary tuberculosis, he returned to his nativeGalicia district, which was controlled by Franco's Nationalists.Forced to join the Nationalists as a private, he was seriouslywounded.   After the war he began studying law in Madrid but devoted muchof his time to writing. He turned to writing full time afterproducing ``The Family of Pascual Duarte.''   In 1977, King Juan Carlos appointed Cela a senator in the firstSpanish Parliament, and he assisted in writing the SpanishConstitution in 1978.   He received the 1987 Prince of Asturias Award for Literature,given by a foundation named for the heir to the Spanish throne, andhas been a member of the Spanish Academy literary group since 1957.   Other well-known works by Cela include ``Journey to theAlcarria'' from 1948, a diary of his walking trip through ruralCastille, and ``Jews, Moors and Christians'' from 1956, an essay ofthe impact of religion on Spanish history.   The Nobel Prize in literature was the last of the six prizes tobe awarded for 1989. All were worth $463,000 this year.   The Nobel Peace Prize was given to the Dalai Lama, the exiledspiritual and political leader of Tibet, for his non-violentstruggle to free his Himalayan nation from Chinese rule.   The prize in medicine went to J. Michael Bishop and Harold E.Varmus of the United States for their discovery of a family ofgenes that helped scientists better understand how cancer develops.   Trygve Haavelmo of Norway won the prize in economics for showingthat mathematical probabilities could be used to predict thepuzzling shifts in the economy.   American Thomas Cech and Canadian-born Sidney Altman, a U.S.citizen since 1984, won the chemistry prize for their work with thegenetic material RNA. The physics prize was awarded to AmericanNorman F. Ramsey for the atomic clock used as the internationaltime standard and to American Hans G. Dehmelt and West GermanWolfgang Paul for a method to isolate single atoms.   The prizes were first given in 1901 from the estate of AlfredNobel, the inventor of dynamite.</TEXT></DOC>
