This announcement is the complete solicitationdocument and no other document for this work is available. The objectiveof this research is to increase the energy efficiency of industrial heatingprocesses through the development of advanced measurement systems thatmeasure the temperature of the workpiece itself, not the temperature ofthe gas cavity in which it is located. Workpiece is herein defined as asolid object, either metallic or ceramic. Examples of applications mayinclude reheating, annealing, sintering, soaking, heat treating, thermalsetting, and curing. This analyzer must be a remote (non-contact) system,capable for use in moderate (andgreater;1000 F) to high temperature industrialprocesses in both new and retrofit applications. The temperature profileand surface temperature of the workpiece will be determined either by directmeasurement or inferred by calculation from direct measurements. Controlof the proposed application using information from the WPTA is not partof this solicitation but would be a natural extension of the solicitedwork.The project is to consist of three phases. Phase I is anticipated to consistof development of a preliminary conceptual design(s) and concept evaluation(s)to identify potential, economic, and fuel saving benefits. Phase II isanticipated to consist of sensor system development, laboratory scale testand evaluation, full scale design, and reevaluation of the economic analysisundertaken in Phase I. Phase III is anticipated to involve fabrication,assembly and field testing of a full scale system at an industrial site.DOE anticipates that this solicitation will result in multiple cooperativeagreement awards for Phase I, one of which will likely proceed to laterphases. Information gathered during Phase I will form the basis for a decisionto proceed or not to proceed to Phases II and III.The project awarded will be cost-shared by DOE and the Participant withthe Participant's cost share increasing as the project proceeds throughthe various phases. DOE has approximately $450,000 available for all awardsmade in Phase I. No fee or profit will be paid to the Participant. Negotiation,award, and administration will be in accordance with DOE Financial AssistanceRegulations (10 CFR Part 600). The Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistancenumber for this program is 81.078.Profit-making entities, individuals, educational institutions, nonprofitinstitutions and other entities are eligible to submit applications inresponse to this solicitation. Federal agencies and/or laboratories owned,operated, or under the cognizance of the Federal Government are not eligiblefor award and should not submit applications. Applications which anticipateparticipation of such a laboratory by subcontract, use agreement, or otherarrangement must include satisfactory evidence of specific authorizationfrom the cognizant Federal agency.All timely proposals received will be evaluated and point-scored in accordancewith the following four criteria: <T3>Criterion 1</T3> is the technical and economic potential of the conceptand is divided into two parts. <T3>Criterion 1a</T3> is the technical viability of the proposed technology(s).Factors considered favorable are high feasibility of the technology(s);low development cost and time needed to proceed to a commercial product(s);and high advancement of the technology relative to other systems commerciallyavailable or currently under development in terms of the potential forachieving energy savings, product cost reductions, and quality improvements.<T3>Criterion 1b</T3> is the applicability of the concept. Factors to beconsidered favorable are high potential for improvements in the proposedapplication(s) when the proposed technology is installed; long survivabilityin the expected environment; low projected operational and capital cost;low space, utility, manpower and maintenance requirements; high reliability;good likelihood of industrial acceptance; and high potential for nationalenergy savings from commercializing the concept on a national basis. <T3>Criterion 2</T3> is the ability of the proposer to successfully completeall phases of the project. Factors to be considered are the proposer'sknowledge of workpiece temperature measurement in general; the proposer'sknowledge of the specific proposed technology involved for measuring workpiecetemperature; the proposer's knowledge of the proposed industrial applicationand market factors effecting acceptance of a WPTA by the industry representedby the proposed application(s); the facilities available for building andtesting the proposed concept; ability to complete Phases II and III; qualificationsof the key individuals and the percentage of their time devoted to theproject; background on the proposer's marketing channels for related productslines; and facilities and personnel for production and commercialization.<T3>Criterion 3</T3> is the Statement of Work relative to clarity, completeness,responsiveness, and adequacy to achieve the stated objectives of this solicitation.<T3>Criterion 4</T3> is the project management plan relative to the completenessand adequacy of the work breakdown structure, the schedule (sequence ofproject tasks, principal milestones, decision points, and sufficiency oftime to complete tasks), individual responsibilities and task assignmentsof each project participant, estimates of personnel effort for each ofthe tasks, resource and manpower availability to satisfy task requirements,and project management methods. Proposals are to be prepared for the completeproject. A detailed Statement of Work and cost estimate are required forPhase I. More general descriptions and rough estimates are also requiredfor later phases.The criteria are listed in descending order of importance. Criterion 1is weighted approximately four tenths the total evaluation criteria value.Criterion 1a is about twice the value of Criterion 1b. Criterion 2 is aboutthree tenths the total value, and Criterion 3 and 4 combined weigh approximatelythree tenths the total value and are equal. Applications should be responsiveto the criteria listed above.In conducting the evaluation of applications, the Government may utilizeassistance and advice from non-Government personnel. Applicants are thereforerequested to state on the cover sheet of the application if they do notconsent to an evaluation by such non-Government personnel. Applicants arefurther advised that DOE may be unable to give full consideration to anapplication submitted without such consent. Information contained in theapplications shall be treated in accordance with the policies and proceduresset forth in 10 CFR 600.18.Cost considerations will not be point scored or adjectively rated. Applicantsare advised, however, that the evaluated cost may be the basis for selection.In making the selection decision, the apparent advantages of individualapplications will be weighed against the probable cost to the Governmentto determine whether better proposals, excluding cost considerations, areworth the probable cost differences.DOE reserves the right to reject any and all applications received in responseto this solicitation or to select any application as a basis for negotiation.DOE may require applications to be clarified or supplemented to the extentconsidered necessary either through additional written submissions or oralpresentations; however, the award may be made solely on the informationcontained in the proposal. A description of the applicant's organizationshould be included in the proposal along with the most recent two years'financial statements. The Government is not liable for any costs incurredin the preparation of an application. Further, cost incurred prior to thesigning of a cooperative agreement are not reimbursable.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATES:</T2> The due date for applications is 4:00 p.m., Mountain DaylightTime, on December 16, 1988.
