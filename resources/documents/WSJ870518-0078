A spokesman for the diversified concern, which has interests in engineering and financial services, said Henley had a positive cash flow from operations of $30 million for the quarter.    A year earlier, Henley had a pro forma net loss of $23 million. Revenue in the latest quarter rose about 20% to $868 million from a pro forma $721 million.    The previously announced one-time payment was for $65 million. In return, Allied-Signal, of Morristown, N.J., will provide credit support for a Henley unit, Wheelabrator Technologies Inc. Wheelabrator will use the credit support to finance several trash-to-energy plants it plans to build for various municipalities. Allied-Signal will have contingent liability for the plants.    Henley also took a first-quarter charge of $24 million for the amortization of good will and other charges connected with the various companies it acquired.    Henley, which was spun off last May by Allied-Signal, reported a fourth-quarter net loss of $354 million and a net loss of $426 million for the year, reflecting huge restructuring charges for three of its major business groups. Henley consists of about 30 different businesses and other assets.    In national over-the-counter trading Friday, Henley shares closed at $24.75, down 12.5 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
