The New York Stock Exchange has investigated 46 cases of suspicious trading by Mr. Boesky over the past four years, but none of the cases referred to the SEC appear to have figured in the agency's celebrated case against the arbitrager, according to aides to Rep. John Dingell, chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee.    Half of the 46 cases have been closed by the Big Board's market-surveillance unit and half are still open, the aides said. Of the closed cases, 13 proved groundless while 10 were referred to the SEC for further investigation.    The agency, meanwhile, has conducted seven investigations of heavy trading by Mr. Boesky and others in advance of corporate takeover and buyout announcements since 1980, according to the aides. Four investigations have been dropped and three are still pending.    At an oversight hearing tomorrow, Mr. Dingell, a Michigan Democrat and frequent SEC critic, will question SEC and Big Board officials about their inability to build a case against Mr. Boesky until Mr. Levine agreed to testify against the multimillionaire investor.    Mr. Dingell is also expected to ask SEC officials whether they have investigated the possibility that Mr. Boesky may have perjured himself in sworn testimony in past investigations.    Last month, Mr. Boesky agreed to an unprecedented $100 million settlement of insider trading charges after Mr. Levine, a former merger specialist at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., disclosed that he had tipped off Mr. Boesky about impending takeovers and other transactions.    Yesterday, Harvey Pitt, Mr. Boesky's principal attorney, wouldn't comment on whether the agreement with the SEC spares his client from further prosecution for past misconduct, such as perjury. He said Mr. Boesky &quot;agreed to cooperate with the SEC and fully inform them of anything they want to know.&quot;    The SEC has delegated the task of market surveillance to the exchanges. The Big Board and other markets, having spent millions of dollars to upgrade their computerized &quot;stock-watch&quot; systems, contend they can detect even minor aberrations in trading patterns.    &quot;We're trying to determine whether these systems really work, or are they trying to dazzle us with technology,&quot; said an aide to Mr. Dingell, a frequent critic of the agency.    In New York, Richard Torrenzano, the Big Board's chief spokesman, said that the exchange's system is &quot;very effective and works well.&quot; Big Board officials &quot;look forward&quot; to explaining how it operates to the House oversight panel headed by Mr. Dingell, he added.    &quot;We shouldn't lose sight of the fact that the SEC has done a superb job in catching Levine and his group and Boesky,&quot; Mr. Torrenzano said. &quot;We hope it will lead to others.&quot;    Mr. Dingell's staff, with assistance from the General Accounting Office, the audit arm of Congress, is also looking at how the SEC handles referrals from the Big Board and other self-regulatory organizations. In 1985, for example, the Big Board referred 65 cases, including raw circumstantial evidence of insider trading in 43 instances.    &quot;We don't have any idea how many cases go to the SEC and just molder there,&quot; the Dingell aide said.    Critics contend that the SEC's enforcement division lacks the staffing strength to follow up on some promising referrals.    Gary Lynch, the SEC's enforcement director, wouldn't comment yesterday. But regulators often say that it's far easier to make a circumstantial case of securities fraud against a small, relatively inactive trader than an investor of Mr. Boesky's stature. Major players who engage in daily block-trading can muster numerous legitimate-seeming reasons for their transactions, ranging from market analysis to rumors. </TEXT></DOC>
