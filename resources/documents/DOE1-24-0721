The analysis is based on the Department ofEnergy (DOE) EOR Project Data Base, which contains information on morethan 1200 projects, and the Oil and Gas Journal. The National Institutefor Petroleum and Energy Research (NIPER) maintains this data base andanalyzes trends in the data for DOE through provisions of CooperativeAgreement FC22-83FE60149. The most noticeable trend is the steady declinein the number of project starts each year since 1981, which correspondsto the steady oil price decline during that period. Exceptions to thistrend are polymer and carbon dioxide immiscible projects. Another trendseems to be toward choosing reservoirs with characteristics well withinscreening criteria, which makes them lower risk projects. True fieldexperimentation with the attendant assumption of higher risk is on thedecline. One notable exception is the initiation of three microbial EORfield projects in 1987. Planned projects for 1986 appeared to have reversedthe decline in project starts; however, the sharp drop in oil pricescaused companies to abandon some projects and postpone others. The newstarts were almost always those with a large capital investment alreadymade. Despits the temporary setback, long-term EOR prospects remain good,largely because EOR remains an economical source of new oil reservesand should play a key role in the drive to maintain oil production throughthe year 2000. 11 refs., 9 figs., 15 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
