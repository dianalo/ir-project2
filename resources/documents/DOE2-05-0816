F344 rats were exposed 7 hr/day, 5 days/wk to RS or SSat 10 mg/m{sup 3}, alone and in combination with D at 3.5 mg/m{sup 3}soot (RSD, SSD), to D alone, and to clean air as controls (C) for 20days. Effects were evaluated at the end of exposure and at 2 wk, 5 moand 11 mo thereafter. Assays included respiratory function, pulmonaryimmune responses clearance of radiolabeled particles, enzymology andcytology in airway fluids, lung burdens of shale and diesel particles,and histopathology. Lung burdens of 590 to 2030 {mu}g particulate/g lungwere present at the end of exposure, and 10 to 21% of this amount remainedafter 11 mo recover. There were no significant differences in accumulationor clearance of particles from the various materials. Body and lung weights,respiratory function and clearance of radiolabeled particles were unaffected.Mild inflammatory, cytotoxic and oxidant protective responses were detected,at the end of exposure, by analysis of airway fluids and histopathology.The decreasing order of response was: SSD andgt; RSD andgt; D andgt; SS andgt; RS. Littleevidence of inflammation was observed in airway fluids at 2 wk or, byhistopathology, at 5 mo after exposure. Pulmonary immune responses toinstilled antigen were increased by SS at the end of exposure, but notthereafter. No chronic, progressive lung disease was observed 11 mo afterexposure.</TEXT></DOC>
