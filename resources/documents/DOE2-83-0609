All treatments were done using the beam spot scanning systemdeveloped for clinical therapy at TRIUMF. Treatment volumes were Small,10 ml of volume using 4 beam spots with a narrow stopping peak; Moderate,40 ml of volume using 4 beam spots with an extended peak; Large, 1.2liters of volume using 37 spots with an extended peak. The dose ratefluctuated considerably during treatment because of the scanning procedure.The relative biological effectiveness (RBE) values of pions were 1.11,1.04, and 1.16 for the small, moderate, and large volumes, respectively.As the width of the stopping peak increased, from the narrow 4-cm peakof the small volume to the 12-cm peak of the moderate volume, the effectivenessof the pion beam decreased. This presumably reflects the low linear energytransfer contribution of the large number of passing pions in the widerstopping peak. The results indicate, however, a greater biological effectivenessfor the large volume than for the moderate volume. Even though thesefields had stopping peaks of similar width, the field size and dose ratewere different. Although the increase in RBE may be partly due to anincreased neutron flux from the larger volume, our results suggest thatmuch of this apparent increase could be explained by differences in doserate as a function of time for pions versus X rays.</TEXT></DOC>
