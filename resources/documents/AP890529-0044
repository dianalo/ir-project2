Hardliners who have seized the upper hand in the government havemoved relentlessly in recent days toward snuffing out the6-week-old movement.   Workers were reportedly being fined for taking part indemonstrations _ few were seen in a march Sunday by about 80,000people, mostly students _ and troops called under martial law weresaid to have occupied Beijing's biggest steel plant.   The state-run press, which only a week ago was filled with headyreports of the democratic protests, was churning out propagandamaterial.   Leading moderates were reportedly in retreat.   Sources said provincial officials have received documentschronicling ``the serious errors'' of reformist Communist PartyGeneral Secretary Zhao Ziyang, reportedly stripped of his post forseeking reconciliation with the students.   Others who similarly advocated political reform or supportedcompromise with the students are expected to be punished or purged.   ``We cannot leave the square!'' student loudspeakers blaredtoday. ``If the People's Liberation Army suppresses us, we willbecome an exemplary model for all future movements to come.''   The announcement, said by the loudspeaker to be from aleadership group, added to the confusion of who was in control ofthe movement and whether the students had veered toward a moreconfrontational stand.   Beijing student leaders had earlier proposed staging a massivevictory rally on Tuesday, then leaving. But students from outsidethe capital, many of them recent arrivals, have resisted.   The Beijing leaders have cited the unsanitary conditions on thesquare, occupied by students since May 13, and the need to shiftthe course of the 6-week-old movement.   Students, they contend, should begin going out among thepopulace to explain their goals. The protesters seek moredemocracy, including a free press and an end to official corruption.   Wang Dan, one of the Beijing leaders, said late Sunday that hewas determined to leave on Tuesday and expects the Beijing studentsto go with him. About 10,000 students today occupied the grimy,foul-smelling squatters' camp in the square, down from a peak of200,000. About half are from outside Beijing and many traveled fordays on crowded trains to take part.   It is the non-Beijing groups that are adamantly opposed togiving up the square.   ``We will not leave,'' said Yao Gangfu, a student from coastalJiangsu province. ``We haven't achieved our goals.''   The loudspeaker announcement called on students to stay untilJune 20, when the National People's Congress, China's legislature,is scheduled to hold a special session to discuss the pro-democracyprotests.   On Sunday, students from most of China's 31 provinces paradedthrough the capital's streets, repeating their pro-democracyslogans and demanding the resignation of Premier Li Peng, whoimposed martial law in Beijing on May 20 and ordered troops intothe capital region.   Another 30,000 students marched against Li in Shanghai, with onebanner depicting the premier as a cockroach with a military cap.   In Hong Kong, police said 500,000 people marched to show supportfor the students. Thousands of Chinese also rallied in Taiwan,Australia, Chicago and New York in solidarity.   Unlike past demonstrations in which up to 1 million Chinese tookto the streets, there were few non-students in the Beijing march onSunday, an indication that the government hard-line stance againstthe protests has begun to have effect.   Workers reportedly are being fined or face pay deductions forparticipating in marches, and people in academic institutes andnews organizations are being ordered to write ``reports'' on theiractivities during the demonstrations.   Such ``reports'' could presumably be used against them.   The state-run media, its journalists now in jeopardy for theiractive participation in the street marches, have returned to beingpropaganda organs for the government.   The official Communist Party newspaper, the People's Daily, gavepassing mention to Sunday's demonstration.   But today's front page was filled with articles of courtssupporting the government decision on martial law, citizens writingletters calling on students to leave Tiananmen Square andgovernment leaders expressing thanks for popular support for themilitary.   Several workers from the Capital Steel Works said troops haveoccupied several parts of the mill, which employs 220,000 people.   They said workers were being prohibited from returning home forfear they would take part in the marches.   Diplomatic and government sources said Sunday that thegovernment has set up a new censorship group to stop publication ofany articles harmful to the conservative faction that has gainedcontrol in China's power struggle.   One liberal Shanghai weekly, the World Economic Herald, has notpublished in recent weeks after defying orders not to print storiescritical of the government.</TEXT></DOC>
