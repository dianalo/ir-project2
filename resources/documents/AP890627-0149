The ministry also said it was investigating a Duesseldorf companythe United States claims was a broker for the transaction.   Spokesman Hanns Schumacher said West Germany asked Iran to recallthe diplomat after receiving information from Washington about hisalleged links to the deal, but the man already had left.   ``The person in question has not worked at the embassy for sometime and will not resume his duties there,'' Schumacher said.   He did not identify the diplomat or indicate why he left beforethe formal request. Informed sources in Bonn identified him as SeyedKarim Ali Sobhani and said he had worked at the Iranian Embassy inBonn since September 1987.   Sobhani's name also came up in the case of Peter Walaschek, aWest German arrested in the United States in July 1988 for trying toship thiodiglycol, which is used in mustard gas, to Iran. Walaschekpleaded guilty and said he bought the chemical at the request ofSobhani.   Walaschek later fled the United States and officials believe heis hiding out in West Germany.   Rainer Mueller, another Foreign Ministry spokesman, said ``wewere informed by the Americans ... last week'' about the Duesseldorfcompany that allegedly acted as a broker.   ``We have notified the appropriate departments to take thenecessary steps'' for an investigation, Mueller told The AssociatedPress in a telephone interview.   Mueller, the ministry spokesman on Middle East affairs, refusedto name the company and U.S. officials also have not identified it.   Tuesday's editions of The New York Times said the company actedas a broker in arranging the sale to Iran of hundreds of tons ofthionyl chloride, which can be used to make mustard gas. It said thegas was to be made by an Indian manufacturer, but most of thechemical was not delivered.   In Washington, State Department spokeswoman said Secretary ofState James A. Baker III told the Hans-Dietrich Genscher about thesales when the West German foreign minister visited the U.S. capitallast week.   Late last year, U.S. officials accused West German companies ofhelping Libya build a facility south of Tripoli that was describedby the Americans as a chemical weapons factory and by Libya as apharmaceuticals plant.   After a long investigation, West German authorities arrestedJuergen Hippenstiel-Imhausen, former head of Imhausen-Chemiecompany. His case is still pending.   Iran reached a cease-fire with Iran in August after eight yearsof war. Iraq acknowledged using poison gas during the war, butaccused the Iranians of using it first.</TEXT></DOC>
