A navy communique said the cutter Yelcho arrived Monday night,the first cleanup vessel to get to the spill site 590 miles from thetip of South America and close to the shores of the AntarcticPeninsula.   Crew members Tuesday morning encircled the nearly sunken vesselBahia Paraiso (Paradise Bay) with floating booms designed to containany further oil leak, according to the communique read by aspokesman at navy headquarters in Santiago.   Divers then entered the frigid waters to seal shut the BahiaParaiso's tanks, it said.   The Argentine research and supply ship grounded on shoals Jan. 28about two miles from Palmer Station U.S. research base. Scientistssay the area teams with wildlife, including thousands of penguins.   The ship holds about 800 tons of fuel, including diesel oil inbulk and aviation fuel in steel drums. Officials of theWashington-based National Science Foundation say oil is leakingslowly from the ship, which gradually sank in the shallow waters.Only a section of its superstructure remains above the surface.   They say a slick nearly 500 feet wide and two miles long istrailing away from the vessel toward the south, threatening thefrozen continent's fragile and unspoiled environment.   A U.S. research vessel, the Polar Duke, was expected to arrive atthe spill later Tuesday. It carries a multimillion-dollar cleanupmission organized by the National Science Foundation that includesmilitary and civilian experts and 52 tons of sophisticated equipment.   Both the Yelcho and the Polar Duke left Friday from the Chileanport of Punta Arenas, a major supply point for Antarctic operations.   Two Argentine vessels are in the area of the spill and plan tohelp, according to the Chilean navy. However, they await equipmentbeing flown from Buenos Aires, Argentina, to a Chilean-run Antarcticbase 200 miles from the accident.   An Argentine Embassy official in Santiago told reporters Mondaythe government would try to salvage the Bahia Paraiso once theenvironmental threat is stemmed.   A research vessel of the Chilean Antarctic Institute also is atthe spill site to evaluate environmental damage, said the insitute'sacting director, Antonio Massei.   In a telephone interview in Santiago, he said the area around theaccident is home to 29,000 penguins. Scientists say many babypenguins soon will take their first swim in the waters, and they areworried they could suffocate in the oil.   Other wildlife also is threatened, including Antartic gulls andterns, and krill, a tiny shrimp-like crustacean considered a vitallink in Antarctica's food chain.</TEXT></DOC>
