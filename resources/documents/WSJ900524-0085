Salomon Brothers Inc. and Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. willsoon join a growing roster of big securities firms inrequiring employees to plow back more of their salaries intothe firms.</LP><TEXT>   The two firms' new compensation plans, due to be announcedin the coming weeks, follow the lead of Merrill Lynch andamp; Co.and Prudential Insurance Co. of America's Prudential-BacheSecurities Inc. Amid Wall Street's recent bad times, thesefirms now require staffers to take less cash and take asignificant part of their salaries in their firm's stock, orin other incentives tied to the firm's performance.   The new payout plans among publicly traded securitiesfirms mark a return to payment practices during Wall Street'sold private-partnership days. Then, spending was carefullycontrolled because the partners' financial success wasdirectly linked with that of the firms'.   &quot;Eventually {Wall Street compensation} has got to becomemore of a business than an art form,&quot; says Michael D. Madden,cohead of investment banking at Shearson, a unit of AmericanExpress Co. &quot;The fruits of our labor should reflectperformance.&quot;   Investment banks, many of whom are struggling these days,save money when they keep more of employees' salaries in thefirm. Bonuses make up as much as half of the totalcompensation for a typical top-level Wall Street executive;the bonuses often are several times the size of a lowsix-figure salary.   Salomon's proposed new payment system was first outlinedby Chairman John Gutfruend at the firm's managing directorsweekend in Orlando, Fla. Under the so-called equitypartnership plan, Salomon employees would receive anywherefrom 5% to 33% of their compensation in publicly tradedSalomon Inc. stock. The higher their salary, the bigger thepercentage Salomon employees would receive in stock,executives say.   The plan is expected to be presented soon to Salomon'sboard, and is likely to be approved within 60 days. Althoughsome Salomon employees aren't thrilled, a number of managingdirectors say they are enthusiastic about the plan, which isexpected to significantly increase employee ownership inSalomon above the current level, which is below 5%.   &quot;You can preach {return on equity} until you're blue inthe face, but you've got to have enough of your net worthtied to the institution where you're working to have asignificant stimulus to be felt,&quot; a Salomon spokesman said.   The Shearson compensation plan now under considerationisn't as clearly defined. But it is aimed at more closelytying the salaries of employees to the performance of theirspecific division, rather than the past practice of linkingpay to the results of the entire firm.   Shearson tried to restructure its payout practices lastfall, but those efforts were sidetracked by the firm's recentfinancial and management problems.   But tomorrow, Shearson expects to receive the preliminaryresults of a compensation study it commissioned from McKinseyandamp; Co., a management consulting firm, Shearson executivessaid. The review will reflect Shearson's soon-to-be-announcedreshaping, which will split the firm's investment bankingbusiness from its big brokerage network.   &quot;It's a top-to-bottom review at all levels and all formsof compensation,&quot; a Shearson spokesman said.   Unlike the Salomon proposal, however, the Shearson plan islikely to include so-called phantom Shearson stock, insteadof publicly traded shares. American Express is scheduled tosoon buy the remaining 30% of Shearson stock now in publichands. Phantom stock, which has no public market, is used inthe compensation plans at Prudential-Bache and Merrill.   Other big securities firms are likely to follow suit inrequiring employees to invest in the firm, securitiesexecutives say, in part, because Wall Street firms areseeking ways to keep key employees from jumping ship.   &quot;With the tremendous number of people leaving Wall Streetbecause of budget cuts, there is a need to maintain thequality of people within firms,&quot; says Stanley W. Butterfass,president of Butterfass/Pepe Associates Inc., a New Yorkexecutive-search firm.   At least one big securities firm recently launched avoluntary payout plan. Bear Stearns Cos. has offered managingdirectors and other high-level employees the option ofputting as much as 50% of their bonus into publicly tradedBear Stearns stock. Employees can then defer receiving thestock portion of their bonus until retirement.</TEXT></DOC>
