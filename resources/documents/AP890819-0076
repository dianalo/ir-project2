But now it finds itself overwhelmed.   ``We are considering whether we should change our policy andintroduce screening,'' said Toshio Tsunozaki, director of theForeign Ministry's human rights and refugee division. ``But ofcourse the biggest problem that arises from screening is what to dowith the screened-out.''   Unlike other countries, Japan has no screening process todistinguish between those fleeing Vietnam for political reasons andthose who simply want a chance for economic security.   Vietnam says it will not accept those forced to return home.   The boat people, turned away from the shores of their alreadyinundated Southeast Asian neighbors, have begun to navigate aperilous route 1,900 miles across the East China Sea to southernJapan.   But with 1,422 refugees so far this year, compared to 219 duringall of 1988, Japan says it can no longer handle the flow.   The country's only refugee reception center, at Omura in Nagasakiprefecture, already was at double its capacity with 415 refugeeswhen 137 more arrived in the nearby Goto Islands on Monday.   ``It is impossible to receive any more,'' said Hisao Nishino,deputy director of the Omura Refugee Reception Center.   ``It's just too much, and the government should do somethingabout it right now,'' he said.   In the latest arrival, a coast guard ship carrying 188 boatpeople was to arrive in Naha on the southern Japanese island ofOkinawa on Sunday morning, officials said.   Hong Kong, flooded with about 52,000 Indochinese refugees, istrying to persuade economic refugees to return home. About 150 havegone voluntarily, and the British colony is considering forciblerepatriation if the bottleneck continues.   Japan is affluent, but unlike immigrant nations such as theUnited States, Australia and Canada, it is very crowded and notaccustomed to accepting immigrants.   ``The Indochinese are the first people to be acceptedsystematically into Japan,'' said Chikako Saito, of the UnitedNations High Commissioner for Refugees in Tokyo. ``Japan hasgeographical limitations, but as a member of the internationalcommunity, it realizes it must share the burden.''   The U.N. agency estimates 2 million people have fled Indochinasince 1975.   Most of the recent arrivals here braved bands of pirates who arebelieved to have killed several hundred boat people in the SouthChina Sea this year.   Pho Van Son, 34, the leader of a group of 151 who left northernVietnam on a 60-ton boat, said he decided to aim for Japan after heheard on short-wave radio that Japan accepts refugees.   The 20-day journey, calling at Chinese ports for food andanchoring at small islands for shelter from stormy weather, wasdifficult, he said. Also difficult, he said, was the discriminationat home because of his Chinese blood.   ``Now,'' Son said after two days at Omura, ``all the difficultyhas passed.''   He and his companions want to resettle in Japan. A poor farmerfrom Hong Gai, Son says he doesn't know what he will do here butexpects the Japanese will find jobs for him and his family.   ``Most of the refugees arriving here now don't know much aboutJapan,'' said Saito. ``They were headed anywhere. They just wantedto get out of Vietnam.''   At the camp, the refugees wear clean T-shirts, shorts and sandalsand look surprisingly healthy. They take Japanese and Englishclasses, eat Japanese food and write letters to relatives, some ofwhom fled Vietnam ahead of them and have settled in such places asthe United States and Australia.   Their 9-by-12-foot rooms, with floors covered in tatami mats, arecrowded with up to six people. Laundry is strung across the roomsand graffitti is scrawled on many of the walls.   Above a framed picture of the American oil tanker that rescuedthem in the South China Sea, Loi Nguyen Hong, 44, and his son, ChauNguyen Hong, 18, have written ``This American ship saved us fromdeath.''   On another wall is written ``liberty.'' Nearby, the word``communism'' is crossed out with red paint.   Hong displayed a photo album with pictures of his brother, aVietnamese translator, and sister-in-law who live in Amarillo,Texas. Hong hopes his brother can sponsor him and his son toresettle in the United States.   Hong's friend, Hung Nguyen, 32, planned to present a petition tothe staff asking for the refugees from southern Vietnam to besegregated from the northern people.   ``We risked our lives to escape communism and to get here, and wedon't want to live in the same place as them,'' said Nguyen, whoused to teach English in Ho Chi Minh City.   Nguyen bears no ill will toward the northern Vietnamese, butthinks he must make clear he is a political refugee to winresettlement in the United States, where already about 800,000Indochinese refugees have settled.   Japan has resettled 6,257 Vietnamese since the early 1980s. InJune it pledged to accept 1,000 more over the next three years, butthat plan would be already out of date if most of the 1,400-plus whohave arrived this year were to remain in Japan.   In 1986 Japan said it was willing to take a total of 10,000refugees from Indochina.</TEXT></DOC>
