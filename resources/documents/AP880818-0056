Israel Televison said a 9-year-old Palestinian girl was killedin the West Bank on Wednesday when soldiers put down a riot, andhospital officials said they treated 105 Arabs beaten by Israelitroops in Gaza.   The army reported three Palestinians wounded in the strip, andhospital officials and Israel radio said six Palestinians werewounded in the Nablus area of the West Bank. The army said it hadno reports from Nablus.   The fatality brought to 248 the number of Palestinians killed inthe 8-month-old uprising against Israel's 21-year occupation of theWest Bank and Gaza. Four Israelis also have been killed.   The curfew in the seaside Gaza Strip, which had confined about650,000 Arabs to their homes, remained in effect in several refugeecamps and towns, affecting about 160,000 people.   More than 70,000 Palestinians remained under curfew in the WestBank.   The army described the four Gazans deported Wednesday as membersof outlawed Palestinian guerrilla groups and inciters of theuprising.   The four _ Mohammed Gharableh, Yusri Al Hums, Ahmad Abu Muailekand Fathi Shakaki _ were taken to Lebanon and offered $50 dollars,which they refused.   ``We shall return to the land from where we were expelled,''Shakaki vowed upon arrival in the Syrian-controlled Bekaa Valley.   The expulsions brought to 33 the number of Arabs deported sincethe revolt began Dec. 8.   The United and other countries oppose Israel's deportationpolicy, which Israel defends as the most effective means ofdeterring violent protests.   The army also handed deportation orders to 15 more Arabs fromthe West Bank and 10 from Gaza, accusing them of ``taking directionfrom terrorist organizations.'' One other West Bank Palestinianawaits deportation.   Fifteen of the 25 were described as leaders of the Palestinianlocal committees or their operational arm, the ``striking forces''which the army statement said ``strive to undermine the Israelicontrol and create alternative administration.''   Meanwhile, Palestinian activists in Nablus used loudspeakers tocall for a two-day mourning strike for the death of two desertdetention camp inmates. Israeli troops killed them during a riot byprisoners.   The riot occurred Tuesday in Ketziot near the Egyptian border.The prisoners threw stones and other objects at guards and beganclimbing camp walls before authorities restored order.   Maj. Gen. Yitzhak Mordechai, Israel's Gaza Strip commander,visited the prison Wednesday and appointed a committee toinvestigate the riot.   The prison opened in March to hold Palestinians jailed forparticipating in the uprising.   Muhammed Naamri, an East Jerusalem Arab attorney who visited theprison Wednesday but was only permitted to speak to the guards,said the inmates declared a two-day hunger strike and were refusingto leave their tents.   He quoted guards as saying the riot was triggered by newsreaching Ketziot of the Gaza curfew.   In Gaza City, just 15 people were allowed to take part in thefuneral of 25-year-old Assad Jabri Shawa, one of the killedinmates, a local Arab reporter said.   Meanwhile, Dr. Ahmed Yazeji, chief surgeon at the city's ShifaHospital, said 105 Palestinians were treated for beating injuries,mostly bruises. He said the beatings looked as though they werecaused by ``clubs and rifle butts and kicking with heavy militaryboots.''   He added that 90 percent of the victims said they were beaten intheir homes by troops searching for people suspected of throwingstones.   An army official said he could not confirm the injuries, butthat the number appeared greatly exaggerated.   Scattered Palestinian protests were reported Wednesday in Gazaand the West Bank, which was paralyzed by a general strike.   In the West Bank town of Jenin, 9-year-old Rasha Artawi waskilled while troops dispersed a riot, Israel TV said. It quotedArab reports as saying the girl was killed by a stray bullet.   However, Israeli army officials told the television that a localdoctor said the girl was killed by a stone. An army spokesmanreached by The Associated Press said he had no information aboutthe case.</TEXT></DOC>
