WILEY</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>SPOKANE, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Billy Tipton kept to himself as his jazztrio toured the West.   He never went swimming in the motel pools. Waiting for a callfrom the group's manager, he'd say, or didn't want to burn his fairskin. He stayed in a separate room, and didn't talk much aboutchildhood or family life. When he did talk, he'd say he came from abroken home and was sent to live with an aunt.   Drummer Dick O'Neill considered Tipton to be his best friend, buteven he was shocked at what the saxophone and piano player had beenhiding.   ``Billy Tipton was a biological female,'' pathologist GeorgeLindholm said after an autopsy on Tipton, who died Jan. 21 from ableeding ulcer.   Interviews with family, friends, colleagues and jazz afficionadosshed little light on Tipton's early years; even her age isuncertain. Kitty Oakes, who lived as Tipton's wife after 1960 untilthey separated about 10 years ago, told a funeral home Tipton wasborn Dec. 29, 1914, in Oklahoma City and was raised in Kansas City,Mo. But no birth certificate has been found.   What is known is that Tipton, a saxophone and piano player wholiked to write vocal arrangements, performed with the JackTeagarden, Russ Carlyle and Scott Cameron bands before forming theBilly Tipton Trio in the 1950s.   ``He gave up everything,'' Oakes, who adopted three sons withTipton, told The Spokesman-Review newspaper. ``There were certainrules and regulations in those days if you were going to be amusician.''   But jazz experts, including several women who played in bands inthe 1930s, said that while there was discrimination, they doubtedthat a talented musician would have had to pose as a man to make itin the industry. They point to Mary Lou Williams and others whobecame famous as jazz musicians and composers.   ``When I first started, I was skipped over unless they couldn'tget anybody else,'' said pianist Norma Teagarden, sister of JackTeagarden. ``At that time, it was hard to break in with a band,especially if you played saxophone.   ``There was a lot of resistance. There were not many women inthat business anyway. You've got to be on the road so much, youcan't very well be married, unless your husband was one of thegroup.''   ``I was a piano player and didn't have any problems'' joining ajazz band, she said. Having three brothers who were establishedmusicians probably helped, said Ms. Teagarden, who performs in SanFrancisco two nights a week.   Marion McPartland, a jazz pianist who hosts a National PublicRadio jazz show, said, ``It's such a strange story, I don't feel itany part of my own career. I can't identify with somebody doingsomething like that.   ``There were many women jazz players around, in lots of bands...I can only say that I've been fortunate in that I've never even hadthe feeling of hopelessness she had to do a thing like that,''McPartland said.   ``The bands were mostly men and I would think in the 1930s, wherethey were on the road doing one-nighters a lot, having a woman onthe bus ... had a sort of inhibiting effect on the language used,and so on,'' said Stanley Dance, who has written eight books on jazzmusicians. ``From that point of view, a lot of males would notwelcome the woman.   ``Still, it seems a little bit extraordinary to have done that.''   ``It certainly was unusual to find a white woman playing piano injazz bands,'' said George Simon, a jazz critic. ``I don't think thatsociety was really well prepared for (women jazz players). Evenjazz, which was as liberal a society as you could find, there wasn'tthat much integration.''   O'Neill said the clamor over the role reversal overshadows thefact that Tipton was a fine musician with a keen sense of humor.Tipton's baby face and high voice prompted some cracks innightclubs, but the drummer said, ``I would almost fight anybody''who said Tipton looked too feminine to be a man.   ``I came from a small town and was a mill worker. He had femininefeatures and at first, I thought he was kind of queer. But after Iwent to work for him I had no reason to think that,'' O'Neill said.``He was a straight guy and there was no hanky-panky.''   Tipton ``was the type of person who would give you the shirt offhis back. He made gobs of money for other people and ended up withnothing,'' he said.   Tipton stayed for several months in a rooming house run by theTeagardens' mother in Oklahoma City, Ms. Teagarden remembers. Tiptonwas in her late teens and lived with an older woman. Even then,Tipton dressed in men's clothing.   ``Billy was trying to get started. She had a few jobs aroundtown, but I never heard her play,'' said Ms. Teagarden. Tipton toldmembers of her trio she had learned to play piano from NormaTeagarden, who also doubts that Tipton played with her famousbrother Jack.   ``A lot of people claim those kinds of things. If they did playwith my brother's band, it was usually someone drafted for one nightto replace one of the regulars who got sick,'' she said. ``There'ssomething very sad about it, to have to live all your life likethat, under false pretenses.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for PMs Feb. 27</NOTE></DOC>
