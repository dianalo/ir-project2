A man dressed in a white robe came down the stairs of the KuwaitAirways Boeing 747 at 9:45 p.m. (4:45 p.m. EDT), got into a car andwas driven rapidly across the tarmac to the VIP lounge at HouariBoumedienne Airport.   The freed hostage, who was not immediately identified, wasgreeted by Kuwaiti officials and hustled inside the building.   Earlier in the day, a passenger aboard the plane pleaded withhis government to meet the gunmen's demands, saying if it didn't,all aboard the plane would be killed.   Algerian mediators and the Shiite Moslem hijackers resumed theirtalks for the release of the remaining passengers and crew aboardthe Kuwait Airways Boeing 747 after a suspension earlier in the day.   The hijackers have demanded that Kuwait free 17 pro-Iranianextremists convicted of terrorism. Kuwait has rejected the demand.   The plane was commandeered April 5 on a Bangkok-Kuwait flightwith 112 people aboard. It was first diverted to Mashhad, Iran,where 57 people were freed. It went on to Cyprus, where twohostages were killed and 13 released, and flew to Algiers onTuesday.   The hijackers, thought to number five to eight, are armed withgrenades and guns and have threatened to blow up the plane and killtheir hostages.   A passenger told the control tower today by radio, ``My name isAhmed Zayed.'' His words were monitored by reporters. ``Hello.Hello to my family. I am in good health. I ask the government torelease the 17 Islamic Jihad prisoners. If not, they will kill usall.''   The talks had reached an impasse on Wednesday. A rankingAlgerian official, speaking on condition of anonymity, saidWednesday that Kuwait's ``intransigence'' had created thestandstill.   A Cypriot official said the jet was refueled and allowed toleave Cyprus only after Algeria gave assurances that the remainingpassengers would be freed on arrival there.   ``Our objective all along was the safe release of the hostages.We believed we had succeeded in this when the hijackers released... hostages here, with the rest to be freed in Algiers, accordingto the Algerian assurance,'' government spokesman Akis Fantis said.   There are believed to be about 32 Arab passengers and four crewmembers aboard the plane. Three passengers are members of Kuwait'slarge royal family.   Two U.S. congressmen Wednesday asked Secretary of George Shultzto intervene with the negotiators because one of the hijackers mayalso have kidnapped Americans being held hostage in Beirut.   Sen. Daniel Moynihan and Rep. Louise Slaughter, D-N.Y., cited areport in the independent Kuwaiti newspaper al-Qabas that said oneof the Kuwaiti jet hijackers may be Imad Mughniyeh.   They said Mughniyeh may have been the chief kidnapper ofAmerican hostage Terry Anderson, chief Middle East correspondentfor The Associated Press.   Anderson was kidnapped in Beirut on May 16, 1985, and is thelongest held of 22 foreign hostages in Lebanon. His abductors alsohave demanded that Kuwait release the 17 pro-Iranian extremists.   Al-Qabas quoted unidentified sources as saying Mughniyeh wasbelieved to have boarded the plane when it stopped in Iran.   This morning, the blue-and-white plane was moved to the end of arunway at Houari Boumedienne airport to permit the safe landing ofa plane carrying Zambian President Kenneth Kaunda, who arrived on astate visit.   Algerian President Chadli Bendjedid, before greeting Kaunda, metbriefly with Mohammed Al-Osaimi, deputy foreign minister of Kuwait.   The president was given a message from Kuwaiti Emir Shiek JabarAl-Ahmad Al-Sabah, according to Algiers radio, monitored by theBritish Broadcasting Corp. in London. No details were provided.   A newspaper in Abu Dhabi said today that an agreement had beenreached for the release of the Kuwaiti hostages.   Al-Ittihad, quoting unidentified diplomatic sources in Larnaca,said ``an agreement was signed by hijackers, Kuwaiti, Palestinianand Algerian officials, for releasing passengers and hijackers inAlgerias in exchanging for reducing sentences against the 17persons in Kuwait jails.''   The 17 jailed in Kuwait were convicted for the Dec. 1983bombings of the U.S. and French embassies there. Kuwait's defenseminister, Sheikh Nawaf Al Ahmed Al Sabah, on Wednesday affirmed hiscountry's ``unwavering and principled stance of rejectingblackmail,'' Kuwait's news agency reported.   Food and water were taken Wednesday afternoon to the jet, whichthe hijackers call the ``plane of martyrdom.''</TEXT></DOC>
