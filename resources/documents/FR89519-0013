As part of that amendment, Figure 3-1 InterchangeabilityDrawing Headlamp Bulb Assembly was adopted. In the Note for that Figure,a general tolerance of plus or minus 1 degree was stated to apply to allangular dimensions specified in Figure 3. When the agency responded to petitions for reconsideration of the Junerule on September 30, 1983 (48 FR 44815), Figure 3-1 was republished. However,in redrawing the artwork for Figure 3-1, the degree symbol mistakenly becamethe percent symbol, so that the general tolerance became one of plus orminus one percent. This error passed unnoticed until recently. NHTSA istherefore publishing this technical amendment to correct it. Because theamendment corrects a technical error and neither imposes nor relieves aburden on any regulated person, it may be published without prior noticeor comment thereon (5 U.S.C. 553(b)). For the same reason, it is foundfor good cause shown that an effective date earlier than 180 days afterissuance is in the public interest, and the amendment is effective June19, 1989.In consideration of the foregoing, 49 CFR Part 571 is amended as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 571_[AMENDED]</ITAG>1. The authority citation for Part 571 continues to read as follows:<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority: </T4>115 U.S.C. 1392, 1401, 1403, 1407; delegation of authorityat 49 CFR 1.50.</ITAG>The Note to Figure 3-1 of 49 CFR 571.108 Motor Vehicle Safety StandardNo. 108 <T3>Lamps, Reflective Devices, and Associated Equipment </T3>is revisedto read as follows:<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Note: </T4>Unless otherwise specified, a general tolerance of plusor minus .004 in.
