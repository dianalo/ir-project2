Gorbachev appealed Wednesdayfor calm in Soviet Georgia but rejected the demands of localnationalists and blamed them for igniting lethal strife he said haddamaged his drive for reform.   ``The interests of the working people have nothing in commonwith attempts to sever the existing ties of friendship andcooperation among our peoples, (to) dismantle the socialist systemin the republic and push it into the slough of ethnic enmity,''Gorbachev said.   They were the Soviet leader's first direct public remarks on theunrest since at least 19 people were killed Sunday in a clashbetween pro-independence activists and security forces.   The official Tass news agency carried excerpts of Gorbachev'sremarks. It said his appeal was published in Tbilisi, the Georgiancapital and the site of Sunday's clash.   The summary of Gorbachev's remarks blamed ``actions byirresponsible persons'' for the loss of life, apparentlyexonerating soldiers and police from any official blame.   In the city of 1.2 million, 900 miles south of Moscow, strikescontinued and funeral services were planned for those killed. TheGeorgian Communist Party chief tendered his resignation, a Sovietspokesman said.   Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze, an ethnic Georgian, metwith almost 200 Georgian nationalists, human rights activists andstrike organizers in Tbilisi trying to establish concord, but theWednesday meeting ended after nearly three hours when manyparticipants walked out, Moscow activist Alexander Podrabinekreported.   Podrabinek said two speakers demanded a special session ofGeorgia's parliament to consider secession from the Soviet Union.He identified them as Karlo Bardavelidze from the oppositionNational Democratic Party and Irakli Shengelaya from the Union ofNational Justice, a group of Georgian writers and otherintellectuals.   ``Shevardnadze only repeated commonplaces about perestroika,''Gorbachev's program for national restructuring, Podrabinek said.   He said student strike organizers and National Democratic Partyorganizers were among many to quit the meeting at the FilmworkersUnion building, viewing it as ``fruitless.'' .   Zurav Zhankarashvili, a Tbilisi resident and member of theGeorgian human rights watchdog organization Helsinki Watch, calledGorbachev's appeal ``very dry,'' and expressed doubts it would beenough to ease tensions.   Gorbachev also made a personal appeal for calm in February 1988after ethnic strife occurred in Armenia and Azerbaijan. His callonly momentarily stemmed bloodshed in those republics, where morethan 90 people were killed last year.   Demonstrations in Georgia began April 4.   The trouble started when protesters criticized calls frommembers of the republic's ethnic Abkhazian minority to break awaybecause of alleged discrimination by Georgians.   Other protesters demanded Georgia secede from the Soviet Unionbecause of alleged interference from the central government andRussians in the republic's political, economic and cultural affairs.   Gorbachev appeared to reject both breakaway demands, saying``reshaping ethnic relations is not recarving borders and notbreaking the country's national-state structure.''   Led by Gorbachev, the Supreme Soviet Presidium, the nation's topexecutive body, also refused Armenian demands last year to annex amostly Armenian region of Azerbaijan. It was that issue that led tobloodshed between those republics.   Gorbachev said the disturbances in Tbilisi had ``damaged theinterests of perestroika, democratization and renewal in thecountry.''   Foreign reporters have been barred from traveling to Georgia,but residents of Tbilisi reached by telephone said the protesterswere killed when soldiers charged an unarmed pro-independence crowdthat massed near the Government House before dawn Sunday.   The Foreign Ministry spokesman, Gennady I. Gerasimov, toldreporters in Moscow on Wednesday that a girl injured in the meleehad died, which he said brought the total number of civilian deathsto 19.   However, the evening government newspaper Izvestia put the deathtoll at 20. Earlier reports said 75 soldiers and police were hurt,but Pravda said Wednesday 91 police and soldiers were injured. Noreason for the change was given.   Gerasimov said the first funerals will be held Thursday. Tuesdaywas declared an official day of mourning for Georgia's dead.   Gerasimov also said Georgian party chief Dzhumber Patiashvili``asked to be relieved of his duties'' at a meeting of Georgianparty leaders Tuesday night but will keep his post until the partydecides his fate.   Gerasimov said Patiashvili offered to resign after widespreadcriticism from other Georgian leaders. He did not specify whatprompted those complaints. Signs posted at Tbilisi State Universityon Sunday blamed Patiashvili for the protesters' deaths and calledhim a ``killer,'' residents reported.</TEXT></DOC>
