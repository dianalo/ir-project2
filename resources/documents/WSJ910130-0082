Financial markets welcomed the latest step by the tobaccoand food company to unleverage its balance sheet. RJR's 17%junk bonds of 2007 jumped more than $40 for each $1,000 faceamount, closing at $951.25 each. The company's publiclytraded warrants, which are practically equivalent to a shareof RJR's closely held common stock, rose 25 cents each in NewYork Stock Exchange trading, to $5.625.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;Anytime you reduce the debt {of a leveraged company} andissue equity, that definitely is a positive,&quot; said SamDeRosa-Farag, an analyst at First Boston Corp, adding, &quot;Thecredit quality of the company will be improved.&quot;   In its exchange offer, RJR is offering to buy as much as$1.18 billion of its 17% bonds from holders, which wouldretire about two-fifths of the $2.8 billion of those bondsoutstanding. For each bond, RJR is offering $465 and 110shares of common, which will start trading on the Big Boardwhen the offer is completed.   When RJR first announced its exchange offer in December,it was seeking to buy a maximum of $753 million of bonds. Butexecutives at Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co., RJR's mainshareholder, said that bondholders responded with enoughenthusiasm for the offer that it appeared likely the offerwould be substantially oversubscribed. As a result, RJR andKKR agreed to expand the offer.   RJR said the expanded exchange offer will complete its&quot;comprehensive recapitalization program announced in July1990.&quot; In that program, RJR has undertaken various financialsteps that are lowering its debt-to-equity ratio to 4:1, froma peak of 28:1 before the program began. Lower debt-to-equityratios are considered more conservative.   RJR currently has about $19 billion of debt, down fromnearly $30 billion when the company was taken private in aleveraged buy-out in early 1989.   An RJR spokesman said the exchange offer is expected to beformally under way &quot;shortly,&quot; as soon as the Securities andExchange Commission gives its approval. The offer would thenbe open to bondholders for a month. Analysts expect the offerto be completed in March.</TEXT></DOC>
