I was very pleased to hear the Aldus PageMaker 4.0 announcementmade earlier this month.andP;  PageMaker 4.0 is the result of Aldus listening tousers from a number of different desktop publishing environments, makingsense out of the shortcomings in 3.0, and upgrading it with many of thefeatures we have all been waiting for.andM;The most significant new features, for me, are the new story editor, thelinks for changes made to documents and/or graphics within PageMaker, and themore extensive typographic controls provided.andM;The &quot;new story&quot; story editor permits a user to bring up a second editingwindow, enter new text or edit imported text, and then place the edited ornew text at the proper point in a PageMaker document.andP;  The &quot;long document&quot;features of the product have also been enhanced.andP;  First, the link dialog boxlists text and graphics files imported into the PageMaker document layout,identifies its file type, and indicates where in the layout (which page) itappears.andP;  Graphics can now be &quot;attached&quot; to specific blocks of text with thenew &quot;Inline Graphics&quot; feature of the product.andP;  The graphic behaves exactly asany other graphic, but is &quot;pinned&quot; to the text in a way that, as layoutchanges are made, the graphic and the reference text stay together.andM;Paragraph enhancements include user-definable widow and orphan controls, a&quot;keep with&quot; option to regulate how paragraphs break from column to column orpage to page, hyphenation flexibility, including user intervention to limitthe number of hyphens which are permitted in a row.andP;  Book features includeindex and table of contents general support as well as the ability to linkmultiple PageMaker publications for chain-printing and for common generationof indexes and tables of contents.andM;The PageMaker color extension utility is now included in PageMaker 4.0.andO;Output directly to a color printer is also now supported.andP;  However, colorseparation requires a separate program like Aldus PrePress.andM;What is the cost for all of this new wizbang publishing stuff?andP;  $795 if youalready have 3.0 an upgrade will cost you $150.andP;  PageMaker 4.0 should beavailable in the second quarter.andM;The real power of the new Aldus PageMaker 4.0 is the inclusion of editingtools we all normally use, a spelling checker, search and replace, theability to change a style and have it carry throughout the entire document,and all the other nice features Aldus and many of the other desktoppublishing companies have talked about over the years.andP;  I also like the linkfeature of the program.andP;  It reminds me of the way Ventura works and shouldpermit us to export our finished product into straight ASCII files faster andmore completely than we are now presently able to do so.andM;Good work.andP;  Thank you Aldus!andM;My Favorite WildmanandM;Those of you who read this column on a regular basis know by now that MarkEppley of Traveling Software fame (and fortune?) is one of my favoritepeople.andP;  He's bright, understands the needs of portable computer users, andbuilds very serious, and easy to use products, but refuses to take life inthe fast lane seriously himself.andP;  Recently Mark had the good fortune ofwooing Dan Crane, formerly of Toshiba America, and then Borland, up to thewilds of Washington state.andP;  Danhas been installed as company president andbrings to Traveling Software all of his industry expertise and businessmanagement talents and skills.andM;Recently the pair stopped by my office to show me a new Macintosh LapLinkproduct, LapLink MAC III.andM;LapLink Mac III is exactly what you'd expect a LapLink product to be, ittransfers files from one Macintosh to another.andP;  Yes, it is even what youmight expect a Macintosh to PC LapLink product to be, it transfers files froma Macintosh to a PC or vice versa.andP;  However, it also has a number of facetsthat you wouldn't expect to find in this kind of a package.andP;  In fact, it's sochocked full of features I'm concerned that they (Traveling Software) won'tget the full story of the product across to the end-user public.andM;Let's start with the cable.andP;  Traveling Software claims to be the inventor ofthe now famous multi-head cable with the original LapLink for the PC.andP;  We areall, by now, familiar with this cable with both a 9 pin and 25 pin serialconnector on each end.andP;  (There is a parallel connector on the PC version).andO;When LapLink Mac first came out, the cable sported the two IBM connectors onone end and the two Apple ones on the other.andP;  Now the cable for LapLink MacIII has more heads than most people will ever know what to do with.andP;  It canplug any Mac into any other Mac, and any PC into any Mac, and vice versa orverse visa or ....well you get the point.andM;Next out of the box is the most marvelous mode for the product I an imagine.andO;You know that connecting two Macintoshes with internal hard disks togetherand transferring data is impossible, right?andP;  The SCSI address of both unitsis identical and, therefore, both machines go nuts when you try to do this.andO;Well, Traveling Software has figured out how to do it.andP;  Simply connect thetwo Macintoshes together and blast the data between them at up to 10 MillionBPS (that's fast!!).andM;There's even more to like folks...Laplink Mac III supports Mac-to-Mac, orPC-to-Mac connections via any set of Hayes compatible modems.andP;  It alsosupports file transfers over a LocalTalk (AppleTalk) network using only 80Kof memory, and runs in the background while a user can &quot;compute&quot; happily inthe foreground.andP;  Confidential files and folders may be protected from beingtransferred by an internal security system.andP;  The system works just as youwould expect it to.andP;  There is a split screen on the Mac and/or the PC andeither can control the process.andP;  Pull down menus and mouse access have beenadded to the PC side of the softtware and are fully compliant with the AppleMacintosh interface guidelines on the Apple products.andM;File translators have also been included so that while transferring filesfrom a PC to a MAC (or back) a word processing file can be translated to showup on the other machine totally formatted and ready to go, all of this withlittle or no degradation in speed and/or performance.andM;Selling for $189.95 including cable, the product includes both 5.25-inch and3.5-inch diskettes for the PC and a 3.5-inch diskette for the Macintosh.andP;  Theprice also includes the LapLink Mac Accelerator (a device I forgot tomention) which ups the file transfer speed between Macintoshes to 750,000baud or 3.5 MB per minute.andP;  Another thing I forgot to mention is that in themodem mode, the transfer rate supported is up to 9600 baud, the PC-to-Mactransfer rate is 115,200 baud, and the SCSI transfer rate is 10,000,000 BPS.andO;Pick your speed and move those files.andP;  Traveling Software never ceases toamaze me with its products and engineering skill.andM;TandyandM;Tandy Corporation has not been sleeping lately either.andP;  The latest batch ofproduct announcements we received includes a new 80C286 based laptop, a 33MHz model 4000, and the 2500 XL, an 80286 based desktop system.andM;The laptop, called the 2800HD, rounds out Tandy's offering to four laptops:The 1100FD, the 1400FD and HD, and the 2800 HD.andP;  This new offering is poweredby a 12 MHz 80C286 and, in a departure for Tandy, is black, a la the Gridunits.andP;  Tandy is building this unit in its Fort Worth plant, making it thefirst laptop to be built at that site.andM;The specifications for the unit are as follows:andM;The 80C286 processor runs at 12 and 6 MHz, has 1MB RAM standard, and isexpandable to 2MB.andP;  The 2800HD also has an 80C287 co-processor optionavailable.andP;  The laptop comes with an EGA Supertwist screen with 16grayshades, 640-by-400 dots-per-inch resolution.andP;  The laptop display screenis 8-5/8-by-9-1/8-inches, and uses EL (Electro-Luminescent) screentechnology.andP;  It also features an 84-key keyboard with 101-key emulation andkey travel of the AT standard 3.5 MM.andP;  The laptop has a 20MB hard disk with a29 millisecond access hard drive access time and comes standard with a 3.5inc, 1.44MB floppy drive.andP;  An external video port provides for both EGA andCGA video modes.andP;  Both serial and parallel ports are also provided.andP;  Includedin the package is DeskMate 3.3, MS-DOS 3.3 and TEMM (a LIM 4.0 memorymanager).andP;  The laptop's battery is a lead acid gel cell that gives up to 2hours of charge and is replaceable and rechargeable in or outside the laptopunit.andP;  The weight of the 2800HD is less than 12.5 pounds including thebattery.andP;  The computer's dimensions are 3.25-incheshigh-by-12.25-inches-by-13.87-inches making it an &quot;iffy&quot; airplane tray tableunit, although the screen hinges about one-third of the way from the back.andM;The list price for the 2800HD is $3,499.andP;  The warranty is the standard Tandy90 days.andP;  An internal modem lists for $199.95, the 2MB memory upgrade costs$399.95, and a spare battery is $49.95.andM;The black Grid-like look is appealing and extends Tandy's line of laptopsfrom the model 102, priced at $599, through the 1100FD ($999), the 1400FD($1499), the 1400HD ($2499) and the new 80C86 2800HD at $3499.andM;Speaking of LaptopsandM;Tandy subsidiary, GRiD systems Corp. (47211 Lakeview Blvd. Fremont, CA 94538,415-656-4700) recently introduced the GRiD 1450SX laptop computer.andP;  thelightest 80386SX battery-powered laptop on the market.andM;This new entry from GRiD weighs just 7.9 pounds and has a high contrast VGAdisplay screen with 640-by-480 pixel resolution and a black and white screenthat displays 16 gray shades.andM;The 1450SX maintains GRiD's distinctive slim black magnesium case andpromises an advanced power management system that extends battery life byautomatically shutting down subsystems of the laptop that are not beingaccessed by the computer.andM;In addition, GRiD has incorporated a standby feature that allows end-usersoperating the laptop on battery power to manually interrupt work for extendedperiods of time without turning the unit off.andP;  The 1450SX also has a sleepcondition, transparent to the end-user, that conserves battery power byslowing down the processor clock when its maximum speed isn't required.andM;Users can choose between GRiD's two optional rapid rechargeable NiCadbatteries to power the laptop for either two or four hours.andM;IBM's RISC-Y BUSINESSandM;IBM aims to take the workstation market by storm with the introduction oftheir new RISC System/6000 family of nine high performance workstations andservers.andM;The new IBM workstations feature IBM's second-generation RISC (ReducedInstruction Set Computer) architecture.andM;Thw workstation's architecture, nicknamed POWER (Performance OptimizationWith Enhanced RISC), is based on and compatible with IBM's Micro-ChannelArchitecture (MCA) and ranges in performance from 27 MIPS (MillionInstructions Per Second) to 7 MFLOPS.andM;The nine IBM POWERstations and POWERservers -- with high-end performance of41 MIPS and 13 MFLOPS -- are designed to further IBM's SAA (SystemsApplication Architecture) goal of a heterogeneous, open system network ableto operate with both workstations from IBM and third-party manufacturers andMicroChannel Architecture computers.andM;IBM Consultant Relations spokeswoman, E.B.andP;  Chapman, said the new workstationsystem would be supported by hundreds of third-party applications, backed byIBM's service and support network.andM;The POWER FamilyandM;The POWER family of workstations, the first of which will be availablestarting in May, followed by the others within an eigth month period.andP;  Theseinclude four desktop workstations, four tower-style servers, and onerack-mounted server.andM;Also announced was the Xstation 120, an X Windows terminal which supports theMassachusetts Institute of Technology X Window System (version 11, release3).andM;AIX 3.0andM;IBM also announced AIX Version 3 for the RISC System/6000 family ofworkstations.andM;AIX is IBM's UNIX operating environment and sofware development platform.andO;The value of the &quot;new and improved&quot; AIX operating system is that, while itconforms to open software standards, it includes a number of new and improvedfeatures.andP;  The features include multi-tasking, physical disk spacemanagement, advanced file system and program management facilities, extendedreal-time support, and an enhanced virtual memory system.andP;  Also included isan optimizing C compiler and a basic set of application development tools.andO;AIX Version 3 is designed to work in a single-user environment or in amulti-user system.andP;  Network File System and Network Computing System supportis also included to enhance the system's distributed processing capabilitiesandM;AIX Version 3 is designed to be the glue that ties the workstation familytogether with IBM's PS/2 computers and the company's new generation ofmainframe computers.andM;The user interfaces announced to AIX include AIX windows and AIX NextStep,the user interface purchased from Steve Jobs and Next.andM;ConclusionsandM;With this announcement, IBM has thrust itself into the workstation warscompeting against industry leaders Sun Microsystems Inc. (and by implicationATandamp;T), Hewlett-Packard, and Digital Equipment Corp.andM;After earlier market fizzles in the workstation arena, IBM is pulling out thestops to make the POWER family of workstations successful.andM;One of the things that will determine whether the RISC System/6000 will be asuccess is IBM's strategy to popularize and implement its SAA (SystemApplications Architecture) strategy.andP;  SAA is designed to provideinteroperability among the many computer platforms IBM hardware operates onto allow applications to be ported/operated from computer to computer,platform to platform.andM;The basic idea behind IBM's SAA is to permit sharing of files, databases,electronic mail, network management functions, word processing documents, andgraphics files to people operating MVS, VM, DB, DB2, OS/2 and OS/400operating systems using common languages and protocols.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
