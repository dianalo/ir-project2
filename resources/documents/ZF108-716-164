Heller, now with aventure capital firm, previously the general manager of the IBM business unitresponsible for RISC and UNIX.andM;In the battle of architectures, &quot;RISC has won!&quot;andP;  &quot;We have sub-cycle RISC[multiple instructions/cycle].&quot;andP;  &quot;RISC designers rediscovered that floatingpoint is important.&quot;andP;  &quot;The large address spaces give a new meaning toaddressing.andP;  They provide one million times more capability [to useaddresses] than the large mainframes.&quot;andP;  The parallelism used in the IBMS/6000 provides &quot;significant improvement over single stream machines.&quot;andM;&quot;It is cheaper to use a compiler than to try to hand-code things.&quot;andP;  &quot;Look fordata flow machines int he 1990s.&quot;andP;  &quot;We need RISC machines in severalarchitectures.&quot;andM;He offered a series of predictions:andM;* By 1995, there will be desktop machines whose clock rates are &quot;less thanone-or-two nanoseconds.&quot;andM;* Gallium arsenide components will start to appear in specialized systems &quot;intwo to three years.&quot;andM;* Multichip modules are coming into use.andP;  Their prices &quot;will fall to [is lessthan] $10/chip.&quot;andM;* new technology is accelerating the trend of the last years -- performanceis now doubling at a faster rate.andM;* There will be &quot;high-volume demand for these new technologies&quot; -- andhigh-volume means lower cost.andM;* Thin-film packages will further improve, increasing systems performance.andM;* 16MB chips, &quot;available today,&quot; will become common.andM;* &quot;Boutique lines of special-function chips will become popular.&quot;andM;* There will be mixtures of technologies: gallium arsenide with lasers, etc.andM;* Memory will go to 64MB DRAMS.andM;Key issues of the 1990s will include bandwidth, bus width, interleaving,power consumption, and interfaces.andM;Special-function chips will be needed for graphics, video, speech processing,handwriting processing, and LAN attachment.andP;  Computer processing of speechand hand writing requires more than hardware technology.andP;  New software willbe needed.andP;  &quot;The whole concept needs re-thinking.&quot;andM;&quot;Consumer markets will help the new technology grow and advance.&quot;andP;  &quot;Pizazzsells!&quot;andM;Mr.andP;  Heller is a strong advocate of digital HDTV (the American version), andhe is strongly opposed to the analog (Japanese) version.andM;In order for our industry to continue its advance, we need:andM;* new storage devicesandM;* cheap X-ray sourcesandM;* innovative hardware architectureandM;* new display technologyandM;* a larger consumer electronics marketandM;He discussed market share vs profits, lamenting that American manufacturerssubordinate their ambition for market share to short-term profit.andP;  Asiancompanies do the opposite.andP;  What does it matter if you make a profit on oneproduct and suffer the loss of the market?andM;&quot;We have to figure out how to work with those people across the Pacific.andO;They got where they are by doing something right!&quot;andP;  (We agree.)andM;He listed some inhibitors to progress:andM;* bad standardsandM;* continued use of outdated ideasandM;* the U.S.andP;  government (regulations)andM;* big organizations protecting their installed inventoryandM;&quot;Compete against companies that are competing against you.andP;  Toshiba, Fujitsu,Samsung, and Goldstar don't have an installed base to protect.&quot;andM;He foresees workstations driving the industry.andP;  He claims they will replaceeverything from PCs to some mainframes.andP;  &quot;The volume gives them a huge priceadvantage.&quot;andM;Some inhibitors to market growth are:andM;* &quot;The market is becoming more and more niche oriented.&quot;andM;* &quot;The cost of sales is too high.&quot;andM;* &quot;Large companies are unwilling to experiment with new ideas.&quot;andM;Application areas of potential growth are:andM;* continuous, untrained, speech processingandM;* friendly software engineeringandM;* anything that enhances humansandM;In performance architecture, &quot;RISC will be the high-volume winner!&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
