(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   President-elect Bush headed back out onthe waters of the Florida Keys today on the last weekend before hisInauguration, intent on capturing what he called ``pound for pound''the world's most formidable fighting fish.   Bush reeled in a 13-lb. bonefish on Friday in his first foraythis trip out on the Everglades side of the Keys, and regaledreporters with details of the exploit today as he pulled away from aprivate dock in a police boat.   ``It really is excellent, just wonderful,'' said Bush, who is onhis third fishing or hunting trip since his election.   The bonefish stripped off 150 yards of Bush's line before hereeled it in, took a picture and threw it back from the 17-footskiff ``The Backlash'' that he fished from in the shallow waters.   ``These are, pound for pound, I'd say, as fighting a fish asthere is in the world,'' said Bush.   Spotting tourists sitting on a narrow dock where reporters andphotographers were recording his departure, Bush asked where theywere from.   ``England,'' replied Maggie Arnold, a 52-year-old hairdresserfrom Bournemouth.   ``England! Are you?'' said Bush. ``Think Margaret Thatcher wouldlike a little of this bonefishing action?''   The British visitor called the next president ``fantastic.''   Bush said he would leave work on his inaugural speech until hereturns to Washington Sunday night. ``Not here,'' he said. ``When Iget back we'll get to more seriousness on that.''   Bush's 13-pounder was just three pounds off the world record forbonefish, said spokesman Stephen Hart.   The vice president, an avid sportsman, told reporters at animpromptu news conference after Air Force Two landed Friday at theairport in Marathon, Fla., that he hoped to enjoy 48 hours in``splendid isolation'' to ``clear the mind for the decisions thatlie ahead.''   He blamed a flood of refugees from Nicaragua on ``tyranny'' inthat Marxist state, and he promised ``a hard new look at immigrationpolicy'' to help communities in Texas and Florida overburdened withthe refugees.   Bush also said he is determined ``to focus all through mypresidency on my determination to help get rid of chemical andbiological weapons.'' He said the furor over the Libyan plant atRabta has enhanced worldwide understanding of the problem.   West German officials are now investigating a German company theUnited States believes helped Libya build a plant capable of makingpoison gas.   ``I think the Germans had a chance to analyze this evidence, butI have never doubted Chancellor (Helmut) Kohl's commitment to thecontrol and the elimination of chemical weapons,'' Bush said.   Bush's fishing buddies including Treasury Secretary Nicholas F.Brady; Sen. Alan Simpson, R-Wyo.; Fred Zeder, a transition adviser;Dr. Burton Lee, a New York cancer doctor; and Irish businessman andraconteur Alphonse O'Brien. A local guide, George Hommel, wasleading the hunt from 17-foot, shallow-water skiffs.   The three-day vacation is his third hunting or fishing trip sincethe election, but Bush said he has no plans for a winter White Househere. In fact, he said, ``There will be no winter or summer WhiteHouses anyplace.''   Bush said he envisions getting to his to his ocean home inKennebunkport, Maine, ``sometime, but the president is sobeautifully taken care of with Camp David and other arrangementsthat I have no intention of building something else.''   Bush said he probably won't get back to the Keys this winter, butintends to fish often over the next eight years, proving ``I'm oneof the classic fishing conservationists ... and demonstrating mykeen personal interests in going after the wily bonefish, or theelusive tarpon or the redfish or the snook that may be lying upunder that branch in the river up the Everglades.''   Asked if he favors a ban on oil leasing in the Florida Keys,Bush, a former oilman, said, ``What does that have to do withfishing?''   He said he was committed both to the environment and ``to prudentdevelopment of our offshore resources.'' The country cannot riskdependence on imported oil, he said. He said any development wouldbe done ``with total compatibility to our marine life and to otherenvironmental considerations.''   Bush promised he would make no news while holed up here at aprivate condominium development until Sunday. But he did offer onedomestic scoop: Millie, the family spaniel, is pregnant. ``We expectpuppies in the White House,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
