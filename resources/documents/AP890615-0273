(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   In an unusual move that has embitteredcurrent and former employees, Goldome bank has threatened to cut theseverance pay of laid-off workers if they talk to the media aboutlosing their jobs.   As many as 150 people have been terminated in recent weeks andasked to sign a ``Release and Confidentiality Agreement,'' accordingto sources within the company.   The agreement prevents ex-workers from suing Goldome ordiscussing their layoff with anyone except ``counsel, personal taxadvisor, immediate family or as required by law.''   If laid-off employees refuse to sign, their severance benefitswill be cut to two weeks pay from a maximum of six.   Although many companies require new employees to signconfidentiality agreements, it is highly unusual for a company torequire terminated employees to sign such an agreement as acondition of receiving severance pay.   ``It's not illegal, but I wouldn't consider it morally right,''said an analyst with Mercer, Meidinger and Hansen, a leading humanresources consulting firm in Washington.   Nearly all of Goldome's laid-off workers have signed theagreement, sources said.   Goldome, one of the nation's leading thrifts, lost $119 millionlast year and is in the middle of a restructuring effort led by newchief executive officer Thomas Cooper.   Goldome officials have refused to discuss the layoffs or theconfidentiality agreement. A bank spokeswoman said Thursday thecompany had a longstanding policy of not discussing employee matters.   Sources within the company said management thinks news ofGoldome's layoffs could cause customers to withdraw money from thebank.   The new confidentiality requirement comes after the companyreduced its severance policy May 1. Companies are not required bylaw to provide any severance pay, but most offer it as part of abenefits package to attract qualified employees and as ahumanitarian gesture.</TEXT></DOC>
