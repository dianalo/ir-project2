Lubicon tribe members have blocked four roads leading to the disputed area.    Edward Battle, president of Norcen Energy Resources Ltd., said the main reason for the closing was to protect workers. Norcen produces about 4,200 barrels a day in the area, of which 1,425 barrels goes to Norcen as operator. William McGregor, president of Numac Oil andamp; Gas Ltd., said it halted its daily output of 150 barrels.    The closing affects about 3% of total production by both Edmonton-based Numac and Calgary-based Norcen.    An Alberta government spokeswoman said the Lubicons -- a Cree community that claims 458 members -- want 90 square miles of provincial government land set aside as a reservation. The land surrounds Lake Lubicon, 250 miles north of Edmonton. The Lubicons also claim the right to use an additional 4,000 square miles to the east, west and north of the lake. There are about 250 oil wells and 22 gas wells in the region.    The dispute between the Lubicons and the federal and provincial governments dates back to 1899. Eight-year-long negotiations broke off Friday night. The Lubicons established four checkpoints on provincial and oil-company-owned access roads surrounding the Little Buffalo settlement Saturday. They declared sovereignity over the 4,000-square-mile area Oct. 6.    Lubicon Nation Chief Bernard Ominayak said the action is being taken to protect the tribe's traditional lands. &quot;These guys {the oil companies} come in and take our resources and leave,&quot; he said. &quot;They're killing the livelihood of the people. It's the destruction of the way of life.&quot;    Fred Lennarson, an Edmonton management consultant advising Lubicons, said all the oil wells in the area have closed. He estimated the usual production in the area was valued at more than one million Canadian dollars (US$827,800) a day. He said about 100 companies are active in the area.    Oil company spokesmen weren't available for comment yesterday.    Mr. Lennarson said the Lubicons are willing to negotiate licensing agreements with the oil companies, allowing them access to the lands under dispute. These would be modeled on accords between the province and the producers, but would include tougher provisions for compensation to trappers. Any revenue would go to the tribe instead of the government under the proposed agreements, he said.    Mr. Ominayak says the Lubicons are unarmed, but will fight if necessary to protect their land. Mr. Lennarson said there have been no incidents at the blockade and that Royal Canadian Mounted Police have advised people not to enter the area. </TEXT></DOC>
