Prof. Thad Godish of Ball State University describes themajor tenet of ACOSH as &quot;I have never met a chemical ofconsiderable economic value that was not safe.&quot; In fact, Dr.Whelan is one of this country's sharpest critics of thetobacco industry (for Prof. Godish's benefit, nicotine'schemical name is C(10)H(14)N(2), and it is a chemical ofconsiderable economic value). Indeed, in my own view, Dr.Whelan, in her zealous concern for improving public health,goes too far, with ACOSH having filed an amicus brief in therecent Supreme Court case, taking the position that warningson labels should not exempt tobacco companies from liabilitysuits.</LP><TEXT>   Dr. Whelan has indeed opposed misrepresentation ofscientific fact by advocacy groups -- her organization, forexample, was the pioneer in exposing the fraudulence of theAlar scare. ACOSH is that all too rare phenomenon -- agenuine consumer health organization, seeking to separate thetrue dangers from the false hyped scares, and to help theaverage citizen balance risks and benefits.
