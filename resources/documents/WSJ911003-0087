The only funds that did better during the third quarterwere those that specialize in health-care stocks andfinancial services stocks.</LP><TEXT>   For managers of small-stock funds, the latest quarterlyresults are yet further evidence that these funds havefinally snapped out of their seven-year slump. Over the past12 months, the funds have soared 49.61%, easily beating the34.56% gain notched up by the average diversified stock fund.   The latest rankings are likely to spark further debateabout whether small-stock funds are headed toward a prolongedrebound. &quot;This is starting to be a world-wide phenomenon,&quot;says A. Michael Lipper, president of fund researchers LipperAnalytical Services. &quot;We've noticed it in both Japan and theUnited Kingdom. We may be -- at least for a little while --in an era where small is beautiful.&quot;   Performance in the third quarter in many ways mirroredthat of the first. As in the first quarter, small-companyfunds were the top performers among diversified stock funds,followed by capital appreciation funds and growth funds.   Similarly, the three hottest sector funds during the thirdquarter -- health care, financial services and technology --were also dazzling performers in the first three months of1991. Gold funds, meanwhile, returned to the bottom of theheap after glistening in the second quarter.   But nearly all other types of funds did well in the mostrecent three months. According to Lipper Analytical, theaverage stock fund posted a total return of 7.31%, whichincludes both the fund's share-price change and reinvesteddividends. That was better than the Standard andamp; Poor's 500stock-index, which was up 5.26% in the same period.   Unless there's a dramatic turnaround in the final fewmonths of this year, 1991 is likely to be the first full yearsince 1982 that stock funds as a group have outpaced the Sandamp;P500. The reason: Stock funds tend to have disproportionatelyheavy holdings of smaller company stocks, and so this year'sfund results have been bolstered by the strong performace ofsmall stocks relative to the larger companies in the Sandamp;P 500.   One big beneficiary of the small-stock revival has beenCGM Capital Development, run by star stock picker G. KennethHeebner. A year ago, Mr. Heebner shifted his fund intosmaller company stocks. That helped propel the fund, which isclosed to new investors, to big gains over the past 12months, including a 24.56% leap in the third quarter.   &quot;Often with me, its just a couple of big stocks&quot; thataccount for the fund's performance, says Mr. Heebner. &quot;Butthis time, there were a lot of stocks up 20% or 30%.&quot;   Those gains have pushed CGM Capital Development ahead ofFidelity Magellan Fund in the 10-year rankings, thus makingCGM the decade's top-performing diversified stock fund. Buton the 10-year list, CGM still takes second place to a sectorfund, Fidelity Select-Health Care.   Ballooning prices for health-care stocks helped many ofthe third quarter's top performers. &quot;Some of our medicalstocks did particularly well,&quot; says Richard Freeman, managerof Shearson Small Capitalization Fund, which was up 26.25%for the three months. &quot;It wasn't just the household names.The market broadened out significantly in the third quarter.We also did well with companies that reported better thanexpected earnings in an otherwise troubled economicenvironment.&quot;   After last year's drubbing, funds specializing infinancial stocks have soared this year. Leading the pack hasbeen Financial Strategic-Financial Services, which has gained67.06% this year through some deft trading.   Earlier in the year, much of the fund's performance camefrom a big stake in banks and brokerage firms. But the fundhas cut back on those two areas, and recently it has made biggains from specialty financial players such as Green TreeAcceptance and Countrywide Credit Industries. In addition,says fund manager Philip Dubuque, &quot;we avoided the insurancestocks, which has been a godsend, because they've done reallypoorly this year.&quot;   The fund industry's 10 biggest stock funds -- those withassets of $3.7 billion and up -- are continuing to do poorly.Over the past three months, these funds are up an average6.15%, compared with 7.31% for the average stock fund. Thatlackluster performance comes as no great surprise. Because oftheir size, large stock funds invariably stick with largerstocks, so they tend to lag behind when small stocks soar.   Gold funds, which led the second quarter with a gain of8.04%, got slammed for a 7.58% loss over the past threemonths. Shareholders of Strategic Investments have had anespecially turbulent ride. The fund, which specializes inSouth African gold stocks, was the second quarter'stop-performing fund, with a gain of 34.39%. But in the thirdquarter, it was the fund industry's poorest performer, down20.47%.   In fact, 22 of the 25 poorest performers in the thirdquarter were gold or silver funds. Gold funds &quot;had a horriblequarter,&quot; says J. Hunter Orr Jr., manager of ColonialAdvanced Strategies Gold Trust. &quot;But it's not too surprising,really. There's very little reason to see why gold shouldmove.&quot;   ---                   Markets by the Slice                                                                                                                                             TOTAL RETURN                           --------------------------------   FUND CATEGORY           THIRD QUARTER    9/30/90-9/30/91                                                                                                          Health/Biotechnology         17.67%          75.31%   Financial Services           11.93           63.34   Small Company Growth         10.70           49.61   Science and Technology        9.80           46.21   European Region               9.17            8.44   Utility                       8.65           24.69   Capital Appreciation          8.16           35.82   Growth                        7.25           34.65   Global                        7.07           20.54   Equity Income                 6.35           26.86   International                 6.28           15.57   Growth and Income             5.70           29.29   Option Income                 4.14           25.42   Natural Resources             3.77            0.21   Environmental                 3.08           19.13   Real Estate                   1.78           28.15   Pacific Region                1.48           18.19   Gold                        - 7.58          -16.19                                                                                                          Avg.
