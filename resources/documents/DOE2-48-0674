It has recentlybecome common to use this steel as superheater and reheater tubing inpower boiler due to the establishment of the characteristic materialproperties and the fabrication procedures for welding and forming. Asthe features of this steel are very high allowable tensile stresses fora ferritic steels, it is considered that its merit is fully utilized,when it is used for large-diameter and thick-walled pipes such as superheateroutlet header and main steam pipes. For the power plants which repeatstart and stops frequently to adjust load, modified 9Cr-1Mo steel willcontribute to the improvement of their flexibility by reducing the outsidediameter of pipes to the increase of their yield strength by reducingthermal stress by decreasing wall thickness and to the improvement ofefficient by reducing pressure loss of main steam pipe. Those superiorproperties bring modified 9Cr-1Mo steel forward as a promising materialsfor the header and piping of power plants.</TEXT></DOC>
