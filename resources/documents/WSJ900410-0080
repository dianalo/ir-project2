Carroll   Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DATE>04/10/90</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE B7</SO><CO>   SUNW T IBM DEC</CO><IN>SOFTWARE (SOF)</IN><LP>   The two sides in the computer industry's war over the Unixoperating system said they have broken off talks on mergingtheir groups and have agreed to go their separate ways.   That represents at least something of a setback forproponents of Unix, because customers may get confused aboutwhich version of Unix to use and delay any purchases. Inaddition, corporate customers will find it inconvenient tohave to deal with two flavors of Unix rather than one --they're already having enough trouble juggling all theoperating systems, types of hardware and application softwarepackages on the market.</LP><TEXT>   Any trouble could be important, because as Unix has builtmomentum over the past couple of years, it has helped changethe rules of the computer marketplace. Unix runs on mosttypes of computer hardware, so customers who use it aren'tlocked in to using one company's hardware, as customersgenerally have been in the past. That has given customers newflexibility; it has also helped drive profit margins onhardware way down.   The one drawback for Unix has been that most versions wereslightly different, so programs for one type of hardwareneeded to be fiddled with before they could run on anothertype. And anything that prolongs that difficulty is aproblem.   At the same time, the end of truce talks was hardly asurprise. The Open Software Foundation -- an industry groupthat includes International Business Machines Corp. andDigital Equipment Corp. -- and Unix International -- whichincludes American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co. and SunMicrosystems Inc. -- had been sparring for the past twoyears.   It had become increasingly clear in recent months thatthey were unlikely to unite. Some of the companies involvedargued, in fact, that the announcement will help sellers ofUnix-based systems because it will finally get customers tostop focusing on the two sides' on-again-off-againnegotiations.   &quot;Now that this whole thing is behind us, maybe we canfocus on the real issues,&quot; said Scott McNealy, chiefexecutive officer of Sun Microsystems, a maker ofworkstations that has been one of the major figures in theUnix wars. He said that it was &quot;absolutely fanciful thinkingthat we'd ever get down to one of anything,&quot; and that thereal competition is Unix against other operating systems, notone version of Unix against another.   The Open Software Foundation said talks broke off partlybecause Unix International and ATandamp;T's Unix development armrefused to turn control of Unix over to the industry. TheOpen Software Foundation had been formed largely because ofconcern that ATandamp;T, the originator of Unix, and its ally Sunhad too much control over the Unix marketplace because theycontrolled the development of the basic Unix software.   OSF also said it decided that its version, to be finishedlate this year, was clearly superior to the latest ATandamp;Tversion on the market. That is especially true, OSF said, interms of the system's security and its ability to run onhardware with more than one central processor.   Unix International said talks broke off because OSF waspulled in too many different directions by its numerousmembers. Unix International also disputed the idea that therewas much difference in the technology, saying it would beable to deliver at about the same time as OSF the featuresthat OSF claimed as advantages.   Both sides were quick to claim victory. Unix Internationalmembers argued that they have built up too much momentum tobe overtaken, because they already have their next-generationversion of Unix in the marketplace, while OSF has run intodelays. OSF members noted their impressive membership list,whose importance was underscored yesterday when severalannounced that they were increasing their financing of OSF toensure its success.   Whether one will gain a significant advantage probablywon't be clear until after OSF members start selling systemsbased on its version of Unix, a year from now. But othercomputer-industry fights like this have ended in drawslately, and it seems likely that this one will, too.</TEXT></DOC>
