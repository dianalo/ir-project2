For purposes of these investigations,the following programs are found to confer bounties or grants:andbullet; Monetary Authority of Singapore Rediscount Facilityandbullet; Production for Export under Part VI of the Economic ExpansionIncentives ActWe determine the estimated net bounty or grant to be 2.34 percent <T3>ad valorem </T3>for all manufacturers, producers or exporters in Singaporeof each class or kind of antifriction bearing described in Appendix A attachedto <T3>AFBs from the FRG.</T3>Based on our July 13, 1988 decision that the subject merchandise constitutesfive separate classes or kinds of merchandise, the exports of the respondentcompanies fall under only one class or kind of merchandise subject to theseinvestigations, ball bearings. However, import statistics collected bythe Department indicate that Singapore exports products under basket <T3>Tariff Schedules of the United States Annotated </T3>(TSUSA) categoriesthat may include bearings in the other four classes or kinds. At verificationthe Government of Singapore (GOS) was unable to demonstrate that only ballbearings were exported to the United States during the review period. Ourdeterminations therefore apply to all classes or kinds of merchandise listedin Appendix A attached to <T3>AFBs from the FRG.</T3>Sundstrand Pacific (Pte.) Ltd. (Sundstrand), which was identified as aproducer and exporter of at least one of the classes or kinds of the subjectmerchandise, has not responded to our questionnaires. As a result, we haveinsufficient information concerning the products it produces and exports,or the extent of its participation in the programs under investigation.However, at verification we did find indications that Sundstrand has participatedin some of the programs under investigation. Therefore, as best informationavailable (BIA), we are assigning to Sundstrand the highest net bountyor grant rate calculated in a previous countervailing duty proceeding forSingapore. The BIA rate for Sundstrand is 4.95 percent <T3>ad valorem, </T3>as set forth in <T3>Final Results of Countervailing Duty Administrative Review: CertainRefrigeration Compressors from the Republic of Singapore </T3>(53 FR 25647,July 8, 1988).Because Sundstrand's rate and the respondents' rate are not significantlydifferent, we weight averaged Sundstrand's rate with respondents' rateto calculate a country-wide rate. In order to arrive at the weights used,we calculated a Singapore dollar value for imports of ball bearings enteringthe United States in calendar year 1987, and subtracted from this figurethe exports to the United States of the subject merchandise of the twoproducer/exporter respondents, NMB Singapore Ltd. (NMB) and Pelmec Industries(Pte) Ltd. (Pelmec), plus the net mark-up on exports to the United Statesof the subject merchandise of the trading company respondent, Minebea Co.,Ltd. Singapore Branch (MSB), to yield a value for exports to the UnitedStates of the subject merchandise assigned to Sundstrand. For the threerespondent companies, the weight used was the ratio of their exports ofthe subject merchandise to the United States over the total value for importsof ball bearings entering the United States. For Sundstrand, the weightused was the ratio of its assigned value of imports of the subject merchandiseto the United States over the total value for imports of ball bearingsentering the United States. We then multiplied the respondents' ratio bythe calculated <T3>ad valorem </T3>rate found for the two programs determined to be bountiesor grants, and multiplied Sundstrand's ratio by the 4.95 percent BIA rate.Summing the two results together, we calculated a weighted-average country-widerate of 2.34 percent <T3>ad valorem. </T3>This applies not only to ball bearings but also asBIA to the other four classes or kinds.<ITAG tagnum="84">Case History</ITAG>Since the last <T4>Federal Register </T4>publication pertaining to these investigations<T3>(Preliminary Affirmative Countervailing Duty Determinations: AntifrictionBearings (Other Than Tapered Roller Bearings) and Parts Thereof from Singapore,</T3>53 FR 34329, September 6, 1988 <T3>(Preliminary Determinations)), </T3>the following events have occurred.Respondents submitted a supplemental response to our second questionnaireon October 26, 1988. We conducted verification in Singapore from November28 to December 8, 1988, of the questionnaire responses of the GOS, Pelmec,NMB, and MSB. Respondents submitted an amended response on February 21,1989, clarifying information and correcting certain errors found duringverification.On August 31, 1988, the petitioner filed a request pursuant to section705(a)(1) of the Act to postpone the final determinations to coincide withthe final determinations in the concurrent antidumping investigations.The postponement notice was published in <T4>Federal Register </T4>on September 29, 1988 (53 FR 38049). We subsequentlyreceived requests from the petitioner and all respondents in the antidumpinginvestigations pursuant to sections 735(a)(2) (A) and (B) of the Act topostpone the final determinations in the antidumping investigations untilMarch 24, 1989. The postponement notice was published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on December 8, 1988 (53 FR 49581). Accordingly,the final determinations in these investigations were also postponed untilMarch 24, 1989.Pursuant to section 705(a)(1) of the Act and in keeping with Article 5,Paragraph 3 of the Agreement on Interpretation and Application of ArticlesVI, XVI, and XXIII of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (the SubsidiesCode), we terminated suspension of liquidation on all five classes or kindsof merchandise as of January 4, 1989, 120 days after the publication ofthe <T3>Preliminary Determinations.</T3>Both petitioner and respondents requested a public hearing in these investigations.Pre-hearing briefs were filed by petitioner and respondents on February3, 1989, and February 9, 1989, respectively. Both parties filed post-hearingbriefs on February 21, 1989.<ITAG tagnum="84">Scope of Investigations</ITAG>The United States has developed a system of tariff classification basedon the international harmonized system of customs nomenclature. On January1, 1989, the U.S. tariff schedules were fully converted to the <T3>Harmonized Tariff Schedule </T3>(HTS), and all merchandise enteredor withdrawn from warehouse for consumption on or after that date is nowclassified solely according to the appropriate HTS item number(s). TheDepartment is providing both the appropriate <T3>Tariff Schedules of the United States Annotated </T3>(TSUSA) item number(s)and the appropriate HTS item number(s) with its product descriptions forconvenience and Customs purposes. The Department's written descriptionof the products under investigation remains dispositive as to the scopeof the products covered by these investigations.The products covered by these investigations constitute five separate ``classesor kinds'' of bearings, as outlined in Appendix A attached to <T3>AFBs from the FRG.</T3><ITAG tagnum="84">Injury Determination</ITAG>Since Singapore is not a ``country under the Agreement'' within the meaningof section 701(b) of the Act, section 303 of the Act applies to these investigations.However, Singapore is a signatory to the General Agreement on Tariffs andTrade, and, at the time of the initiation of these investigations, certainproducts included in the scope of these investigations (<T3>i.e., </T3>those classified under TSUSA categories 681.1010, 681.1030,681.3900, and 692.3295) were nondutiable. However, on January 1, 1989,Singapore lost its Generalized System of Preference status and the productslisted above are no longer duty-free. Consequently, the ITC is no longerrequired to determine whether imports of products entering under thesecategories materially injure, or threaten material injury to, U.S. industries.<ITAG tagnum="84">Analysis of Programs</ITAG>For purposes of these final determinations, the period for which we aremeasuring bounties or grants (``the review period'') is October 1, 1986,to September 30, 1987, which corresponds to the fiscal year of the respondentcompanies.Based upon our analysis of the petition, the responses to our questionnaires,verification, and written comments filed by petitioner and respondents,we determine the following:I. Programs Determined to Confer Bounties or GrantsWe determine that bounties or grants are being provided to manufacturers,producers or exporters in Singapore of bearings under the following programs:<ITAG tagnum="81">A. Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) Rediscount Facility</ITAG>The primary objective of the MAS rediscounting scheme is to provide exportersof locally manufactured export products better access to short-term financing.Under the scheme, the MAS rediscounts pre-export and export bills of exchange.Commercial banks act as intermediaries between the exporters and the MAS.The bank first discounts the bill with the exporter at the MAS rediscountrate plus a maximum spread of 1.5 percent before subsequently rediscountingthe bill with the MAS at the MAS rediscount rate.All three respondent companies participated in this program during thereview period. Because this program is available only to exporters, wedetermine that it is countervailable to the extent that MAS discountingis offered at preferential rates.To determine whether financing under this program was made at preferentialrates, we compared the interest rates charged on these loans to our short-termbenchmark. As the benchmark for short-term loans, it is our practice touse the national average commercial interest rate or the most comparable,predominant form of short-term financing. In the case of Singapore, verificationestablished that there was no predominant form of short-term financingduring the review period. The commercial bill rate, which we used as thebenchmark in making our preliminary determinations, applied to less than10 percent of the total Singapore dollar-denominated short-term financingduring the review period. We therefore used a weighted average of the overdraft,commercial bill, and short-term loan rates as the benchmark for purposesof our final determinations. The data used to calculate this weighted-averageinterest rate was verified at the MAS. Based on this comparison, the rateson MAS financing through its rediscounting facility are preferential and,therefore, confer bounties or grants on exports of bearings.To calculate the benefit arising from this program, we followed our short-termloan methodology, which has been applied consistently in our past determinationsand which is described in more detail in the <T3>Subsidies Appendix </T3>attached to the notice of <T3>Cold-Rolled Carbon Steel Flat-Rolled Products from Argentina: FinalAffirmative Countervailing Duty Determination and Countervailing Duty Order</T3>(49 FR 18006, April 26, 1984); <T3>see also, Alhambra Foundry v. </T3><T3>United States, </T3>626 F. Supp. 402 (CIT, 1985).We compared the amount of interest actually paid during the review periodto the amount that would have been paid at the benchmark rate. Becausewe verified that individual discount transactions cannot be tied to exportsof specific products to specific markets, we included all discount transactionsmade by the two producer/exporter respondents, NMB and Pelmec, on whichinterest was paid during the review period, and prorated the benefit dueto discount transactions on which interest was paid by the trading company,MSB, by the ratio of its exports to the United States of the subject merchandiseover its total exports. We allocated the result over NMB and Pelmec's totalexports plus MSB's net mark-up on exports to the United States of the subjectmerchandise to arrive at an estimated net bounty or grant of 0.08 percent<T3>ad valorem.</T3><ITAG tagnum="81">B. Production for Export under Part VI of the Economic Expansion IncentivesAct (EEIA)</ITAG>Under Part VI of the EEIA, 90 percent of a qualifying company's incrementalexport profit above a predetermined export base is exempt from corporateincome tax. The export base is calculated by taking the average of theexport profit levels in the three years preceding the application. Theexport base profit and ten percent of any incremental export profit aretaxed at the normal corporate tax rate of 33 percent. If there is no exportprofit above the export base, no exemption is permitted. The exemptioncannot be carried forward or back.An exporting company qualifies for the exemption if its export sales ofa product are 100,000 Singapore dollars or more, and at least 20 percentof the value of its total sales of the product.Because eligibility for this program is contingent upon export performance,we determine that it is countervailable. We verified that only NMB claimedan exemption under this program on its tax return filed during the reviewperiod. Because all products exported by NMB Singapore have been approvedunder this program, the company does not segregate exempted profits byproduct or market. We calculated the benefit under this program by obtainingthe difference between what NMB paid in corporate income tax during thereview period with the exemption and what it would have paid absent theexemption. We then allocated this amount over the total export sales ofthe two producer/exporter respondents, NMB and Pelmec, plus MSB's net mark-upon exports to the United States of the subject merchandise, to arrive atan estimated net bounty or grant of 2.02 percent <T3>ad valorem.</T3>II. Programs Determined Not to Confer Bounties or GrantsWe determine that bounties or grants are not being provided to manufacturers,producers or exporters in Singapore of bearings under the following programs:<ITAG tagnum="81">A. The Pioneer Industries Program under Part II of the EEIA</ITAG>Under Part II of the EEIA, profits that arise from projects approved as``Pioneer'' activities are exempt from the corporate income tax of 33 percent.The Economic Development Board (EDB), which administers the program, approvesapplications only if they meet both of the following criteria: (1) Theproject introduces technology, know-how or skills that are substantiallymore advanced than that of the average level prevailing in the industry,and (2) there are no companies in Singapore performing a similar activitywithout being awarded pioneer status. Additionally, proposed projects mustmeet one or more of the following criteria: (3) the gross value-added perworker of the project is substantially higher than the relevant industry'sgross value-added per worker, (4) the project supplies important partsand components to other industries, or (5) the project generates substantialeconomic benefits (as measured by the level of fixed asset investments).NMB enjoyed pioneer status from 1973 through 1978, at which time all ofits pioneer benefits expired. Pelmec was granted pioneer status for theperiod of July 15, 1980, through July 14, 1990. The GOS specified how Pelmec'sapplication met the eligibility criteria for pioneer status. The GOS alsoprovided industry breakdowns of approvals and rejections for each yearfrom 1978 through 1982, a window period that spans the two years priorto Pelmec's approval in 1980 and the following two years. During this period,the EDB approved hundreds of applications covering a broad range of industriesincluding food, beverages and tobacco, textiles, footwear and leather,wood and cork products, paper and paper products, chemicals, petroleumand petroleum products, rubber, plastics, pottery and dinnerware, basicmetals, fabricated metal products, non-electrical machinery, electricalmachinery, electronic products and components, transport equipment, precision,photographic, and optical equipment, and other manufacturing. During thissame period, the EDB rejected only a minuscule number of applications.At verification we found no evidence that this program is targeted towardspecific industries or toward exporters. In addition, our examination ofrandomly selected case files at verification indicated that the criteriawere applied consistently and objectively. Therefore, we determine thatbenefits under this program are not limited to a specific enterprise orindustry, or group of enterprises or industries, and as such, are not countervailable.<ITAG tagnum="81">B. Section 16 of the Income Tax Act (ITA)</ITAG>The EDB administers section 16 of the ITA which provides an annual allowanceof three percent plus an additional 25 percent for the depreciation ofindustrial buildings. In <T3>Final Negative Countervailing Duty Determination: Carbon Steel WireRod from Singapore, </T3>53 FR 16304, May 6, 1988, (<T3>Wire Rod</T3>), issued approximately two weeks after the initiationof the present investigations, we determined that this program is not countervailablebecause these allowances are the standard depreciation allowances permittedin Singapore. Since that determination, we have received no new facts orinformation on changed circumstances with respect to this program. Therefore,we continue to consider this program not countervailable.<ITAG tagnum="81">C. Section 19A of the ITA</ITAG>Section 19A of the ITA allows a company to depreciate all capital expenditures,with the exception of automobiles and robotics, over a three-year period.In <T3>Wire Rod, </T3>we determined that this provision is not countervailablebecause it is available to all enterprises in Singapore. Since that determination,we have received no new facts or information on changed circumstances withrespect to this program. Therefore, we continue to consider this programnot countervailable.III. Programs Determined Not To Be UsedWe determine, based on verified information, that manufacturers, producersor exporters in Singapore of bearings did not apply for, claim or receivebenefits during the review period for exports of bearings to the UnitedStates under the following programs, which were listed in the Notice ofInitiation (53 FR 15084, April 27, 1988):<ITAG tagnum="81">A. Tax Incentives under the EEIA</ITAG>The EEIA offers tax incentives under the following provisions:andbullet; Part IV: Expansion of Established Enterprisesandbullet; Part VII: International Trade Incentivesandbullet; Part VIII: Foreign Loans for Productive Equipmentandbullet; Part IX: Royalties, Fees and Development Contributionsandbullet; Part X: Research and Development Incentivesandbullet; Part XI: Warehousing and Servicing Incentives<ITAG tagnum="81">B.

Other EDB Programs</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="81">E. Research and Development Assistance Scheme (RDAS)</ITAG>For a complete description of these programs, see the <T3>Preliminary Determinations</T3><ITAG tagnum="84">Comments</ITAG><T3>Comment 1: </T3>Petitioner claims that all classes or kinds of merchandiseshould be covered by the duty deposit rate, since the GOS could not provethat there were no exports of the four classes or kinds other than ballbearings.Respondents argue that the investigations should be terminated with respectto these other four classes or kinds because ball bearings are the onlyproduct mentioned in the petition. Respondents contend that petitionerhas not shown that there are exports to the United States of the subjectmerchandise other than ball bearings.<T3>DOC Position: </T3>Prior to the preliminary determinations, we determinedthat the subject merchandise in these investigations would be divided intofive classes or kinds. The three respondent companies export only ballbearings. Sundstrand, which was identified by the GOS as a producer andexporter of the subject merchandise, did not respond to our questionnaires.As a result, we do not know what class or kind of merchandise Sundstrandproduces or exports. Sundstrand submitted a letter indicating that theyexport goods to the United States under TSUSA categories which could includeall five classes or kinds of the subject merchandise. Furthermore, duringverification, the GOS was unable to demonstrate that no other classes orkinds of merchandise other than ball bearings are exported to the UnitedStates. Therefore, these determinations apply to all five classes or kindsof merchandise subject to these investigations.<T3>Comment 2: </T3>Petitioner argues that the Department should not usethe three-month rate on commercial bills as the benchmark for this programbecause it is not the most prevalent form of short-term financing. In aprevious case, <T3>Final Negative Countervailing Duty Determinations: Certain TextileMill Products and Apparel from Singapore, </T3>50 FR 9840, May 6, 1985(<T3>Textiles</T3>), the Department used the commercial bill rate as thebenchmark. Petitioner argues that the situation in Singapore has changedsignificantly since that determination, and that the Department shouldtherefore not use the commercial bill rate for the benchmark. Moreover,petitioner claims the commercial bill rate is itself preferential sincethere is no reserve requirement associated with it. Petitioner assertsthat the Department should use a weighted average of the overdraft rateand the rate for short-term loans as the benchmark.Respondents argue that the commercial bill rate is the appropriate benchmarkbecause it is the most similar type of financing to that provided by theMAS Rediscount Facility, since both types of financing are used to financetrade. Respondents state that there is no reserve requirement on commercialbills because commercial bills are secured by accounts receivable. Furthermore,respondents claim that commercial bills actually represented a smallerpercentage of short-term financing during <T3>Textiles </T3>than they do now.<T3>DOC Position: </T3>We used a weighted average of the three types ofshort-term financing available exclusively in Singapore dollars, namely,overdrafts, short-term loans and commercial bills, because this weightedaverage best represents the market cost to an exporter of financing short-termcash needs. In our view, the commercial bill rate does not reflect thiscost as it represents less than 10 percent of overdrafts, short-term loansand commercial bills during the review period. We disagree with petitioner,however, that commercial bills should not be included in the calculationof the national average short-term rate. Commercial bills are an alternativeform of financing available to exporters and should thus be included inthe weighted average. Trust receipts, a fourth type of short-term financingused to finance imports, were not included in our formula because we donot have adequate data on this type of financing, some of which may begiven in foreign currency.<T3>Comment 3: </T3>Respondents argue that the benchmark should be calculatedfor the review period rather than calculating one benchmark for calendaryear 1986 and one for calendar year 1987.<T3>DOC Position: </T3>We agree that the benchmark should be calculatedfor the review period for purposes of these investigations. However, wewant to stress that calculating a benchmark for a review period that doesnot coincide with a calendar year may not be applicable to other investigations.First, in these investigations we have published data on a weekly and monthlybasis which permitted us to calculate the benchmark over the review period.In situations where only annual data is available we would have to usea calendar-year benchmark. Secondly, exporters pay interest under the MASscheme at the time the loan terms are set. (Interest is paid up-front insteadof at the end of the loan's term.) Since we considered only those MAS loansfor which interest was paid during the review period, and, thus, only thoseloans for which the financing terms were set during the review period,it was appropriate to calculate a benchmark based on commercial loan termsprevailing during the same period. In situations where interest is notpaid at the time the loan terms are set, we would have to use a calendar-yearbenchmark because the dates when the terms of the loans were set wouldnot coincide with the review period.<T3>Comment 4: </T3>Respondents argue that verification showed that competitionhad narrowed the commission charged on commercial bills and that, as aresult, it was inappropriate to use the 0.50 percent spread that was usedin the preliminary determinations.Petitioner argues that there is a range of possible spreads on commercialbills, from 0.125 percent to 0.50 percent, and that the Department shouldassume that the highest possible spread applies in the absence of morespecific information.<T3>DOC Position: </T3>We used the average spread on each type of financingin our benchmark calculation. We verified that this average is actually0.25 percent for commercial bills, since the average commission chargedis lower than the median of 0.125 percent and 0.50 percent, due to competitionamong banks.<T3>Comment 5: </T3>Petitioner claims that we should use exports to theUnited States as the denominator for the MAS loan program as best informationavailable, rather than all exports, because the respondents could not linkthe loans to specific export destinations. Petitioner argues that the Actcalls for use of best information available whenever respondent is unwillingor unable to provide the information requested.Respondents argue that the Department was correct to use total exportsas the denominator in the preliminary determinations. They claim that theydo not keep the records necessary to link the loans with specific exportdestinations. Moreover, respondents contend that verification showed thatthese loans were used to finance exports to destinations other than theUnited States.<T3>DOC Position: </T3>We agree with respondents. At verification we foundthat it is not possible to link loans to specific export markets. One loanoften finances trade of several products to several markets. If we couldhave segregated the loans by exports to the United States of the subjectmerchandise, this would have been our preference. Since this was not possible,we allocated total benefits over total exports for the two producer/exporterrespondents. However, because the third respondent, MSB, is a trading company,we must calculate its benefits with respect to its net mark-up on exportsto the United States of the subject merchandise. This is done (1) to avoiddouble-counting, as MSB's export sales value includes the price of NMB'ssales exported through MSB, and (2) because MSB's export sales value alsoincludes the price of non-respondents' sales exported through MSB. Accordingly,we prorated MSB's benefit by its exports to the United States of the subjectmerchandise over its total exports. We then allocated NMB's and Pelmec'stotal benefits plus MSB's prorated benefit over NMB's and Pelmec's totalexports plus MSB's net mark-up on its exports to the United States of thesubject merchandise.<T3>Comment 6: </T3>Petitioner argues that the Pioneer Industries Programshould be found countervailable because it provides specific benefits tospecific industries. Petitioner argues that the Department should reverseits preliminary determinations on this program for three reasons. The firstis that the specificity test which was applied is not consistent with theCIT decision in <T3>Cabot Corp </T3>v. <T3>United States, </T3>12 CIT, 694 F. Supp. 949, 957 (1988). The secondis that the criteria for the program are subjective and unpredictable.The third is that the GOS has considerable discretion in the implementationof this program.Respondents maintain that the criteria used for this program are objectiveand non-limiting. They argue that the Department verified that the programprovided benefits to different types of industries.<T3>DOC Position: </T3>At verification we found no evidence that this programis targeted toward any specific industries or toward exporters. See sectionII. A., above.<T3>Comment 7: </T3>Petitioner argues that the Department should find InvestmentAllowances under Part X of the EEIA to be countervailable. Petitioner claimsthat in <T3>Textiles </T3>the Department only verified nominal availability anddid not examine the actual implementation of the program. Petitioner allegesthat two respondent companies applied for benefits under this program in1988.Respondents claim that petitioner has not provided any new informationto warrant changing the preliminary determination that this program wasnot used.<T3>DOC Position: </T3>Part VIA of the EEIA was found not countervailablein <T3>Textiles. </T3>In <T3>Wire Rod, </T3>Part VIA had been amended and changed to Part X. Inthat investigation, as in these investigations, Part X was determined tobe not used. The issue of countervailability has consequently not beenaddressed. We have no reason to find this program countervailable sincewe have verified that it was not used. Moreover, petitioner is arguingthat respondents filed for benefits outside the review period. We do notconsider information from beyond the review period unless there has beena program-wide change.<T3>Comment 8: </T3>Respondents claim that the Department should calculatethe benefit for the Production for Export program based on what NMB wouldhave paid in taxes absent this program, rather than on the nominal valueof the tax exempt income. Respondents claim that if NMB had not used thisprogram, the company would have used other deductions which were insteadcarried forward.Petitioner argues that the Department should ignore the carryforwards becauseit should not consider the secondary effects of a tax program.<T3>DOC Position: </T3>Since the tax exemption is based on an increasein exports over a base year and thus cannot be determined in advance, anda decision whether or not to use other deductions or carry them forwardis at the taxpayer's discretion, any adjustment involving carryforwardswould be speculative. <T3>Comment 9: </T3>Petitioner asserts that the duty deposit rate shouldbe a weighted average of all duty deposit rates, including the BIA rateapplied to Sundstrand. Respondents argue that the Department should issue a separate rate forSundstrand. They contend that a weighted-average duty rate would unfairlypenalize the companies which participated in the investigations. <T3>DOC Position: </T3>Under the new countervailing duty regulations, wemust issue one country-wide rate unless the separate rates are ``significantlydifferent'' as defined in andSection; 355.20(d) of the Department's regulations.<T3>See </T3>53 FR 52353 (December 27, 1988) (to be codified at 19 CFR355.20(d)). The BIA rate for Sundstrand (4.95 percent) and the country-widerate for the three respondents (2.10 percent) are not ``significantly different.''To calculate a country-wide rate, we first calculated the Singapore dollarvalue of ball bearings imported into the United States by multiplying theU.S. dollar import value for the relevant TSUSA categories by the averageexchange rate during the review period. We used imports for calendar year1987 to approximate the review period because most review period exportswould have entered the United States during this time. We then subtractedfrom this figure NMB's and Pelmec's exports to the United States of thesubject merchandise and MSB's net mark-up on exports to the United Statesof the subject merchandise to yield a value for exports to the United Statesof the subject merchandise assigned to Sundstrand. To obtain the country-widerate of 2.34 percent, we weight averaged the rate for respondents and theBIA rate for Sundstrand using each party's (respondents' and Sundstrand's)share of total imports of ball bearings to the United States. <T3>Comment 10: </T3>Petitioner argues that we should calculate the benefitattributable to Sundstrand by adding the total benefit attributable toNMB and Pelmec and allocating this amount over Sundstrand's sales. <T3>DOC Position: </T3>We believe that the method of weight averaging explainedabove in the section on <T3>Final Determinations </T3>and in the <T3>DOC Position </T3>on <T3>Comment 9 </T3>most accurately incorporates the BIA rate for Sundstrandinto a country-wide rate. <T3>Comment 11: </T3>Respondents argue that the Department was not consistentwith the denominators used in calculating the estimated net bounty or grant.For MSB, the denominator was the mark-up on exports of the subject merchandiseto the United States, and for the other two companies, the denominatorwas total exports. <T3>DOC Position: </T3>MSB is a trading company and not a producer/exporter,and thus warrants different treatment. It would be inappropriate to useMSB's total exports in the denominator for the two reasons discussed abovein the <T3>DOC Position </T3>on <T3>Comment 5. </T3>We therefore used its net mark-up on exports to theUnited States of the subject merchandise and added this figure to NMB'sand Pelmec's total exports to obtain our denominator. Accordingly, we proratedMSB's benefits by the ratio of its exports to the United States of thesubject merchandise over its total exports. <ITAG tagnum="84">Verification </ITAG>Except where noted, we verified the information used in making our finaldeterminations in accordance with section 776(b) of the Act.
