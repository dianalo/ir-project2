ShererandM;Microsoft Corp. recently gave a crystal ball glimpse into the future of itslanguage strategy, revealing plans to expand its integrated developmentenvironment to allow Microsoft and third-party tools to share a wealth ofprogram information.andM;As outlined in a recent technical briefing, this ability to share programinformation among a suite of language tools will speed up the developmentprocess and open up access to a full plate of third-party tools, Microsoftofficials said.andM;Without discussing a specific time frame, Microsoft officials said it willtake years before all the components in this new Advanced DevelopmentEnvironment fall into place.andM;Microsoft's current integrated environment -- the Programmer's Workbench(PWB) -- runs in a character-based environment, but the company's futureproducts will run in the graphical world of Windows and OS/2 PresentationManager, company officials said.andM;&quot;In the first phase of evolution, we'll evolve the Programmer's Workbenchinto a full GUI environment,&quot; said Fred Gray, general manager of languages atMicrosoft, in Redmond, Wash.andP;  &quot;The other phase is to move from the 'browserdatabase' we have today into an object-oriented system that retains all theinformation generated by the various tools.&quot;andM;Microsoft took its first shot at an integrated development environment lastApril with the introduction of PWB in Microsoft C 6.0.andM;PWB provides facilities that allow Microsoft and third-party language toolsto exchange information such as the location of the cursor and break points.andM;It also includes a source-code browser that shows programmers the structureof their programs.andM;However, the Advanced Development Environment discussed by Microsoftofficials would go far beyond PWB by storing information used by eachlanguage tool in a centralized database.andP;  For example, the symbol tablesgenerated by a compiler could be reused by a debugger or another tool.andP;  Withthe current PWB, each tool must regenerate this information.andM;Rather than relying on a relational database that stores data in tabularformat, Microsoft is looking to use an object-oriented database in itsAdvanced Development Environment, officials said.andP;  This approach could storedata without translation, allowing for faster performance when complex datarelationships exist.andP;  It could also maintain links between objects when aprogram shuts down, said Manny Vellon, the development manager forMicrosoft's development environments.andM;An object-oriented database would also allow developers to attach multipletypes of data to their code, Vellon said.andP;  For example, bug reports could beattached to code modules, and version-control software could also beintegrated to help programming teams better coordinate their efforts, heexplained.andM;&quot;When you have more than three or four people working on a project, on-linetools for interprogrammer communication become much more important,&quot; saidSteve Hersee, president of Copia International Ltd., a Wheaton, Ill., makerof a database library.andP;  &quot;A database would help you find what the side effectsof a change will be.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
