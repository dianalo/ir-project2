Communist regimes in Asia have long been privatelycritical of Mikhail Gorbachev for his support of politicalpluralism and his concessions to the West. It was thus nosurprise that their media energetically reported the oustingof the Soviet leader. Now, with Mr. Gorbachev back in thesaddle, Russian President Boris Yeltsin acquiring moreauthority and the Communist Party threatened with extinctionacross the Soviet Union, Asian communists may face furtherisolation.</LP><TEXT>   Vietnamese reaction to the coup paralleled China's to someextent. The media, which reported the coup with an extensiveaccount of the statements of the junta, played down theopposition. Radio broadcasts largely ignored the contents ofMr. Yeltsin's denunciation of the coup, mentioning it only inthe context of the junta's criticism of the Russian republic.   In addition, says an analyst in Washington, &quot;the way Hanoireported the reaction of other republics, they made themsound almost supportive of the coup.&quot;   When the coup ended, the Vietnamese media simply quoted anofficial statement from the Soviet Foreign Ministry that Mr.Gorbachev was back in full control.   Vietnamese leaders have criticized Mr. Gorbachev privatelyat party meetings for what they considered unprincipledcapitulation to the imperialist bloc. Hanoi's hardlineleaders had hoped that conservative communists in the SovietUnion would stand up to oppose Mr. Gorbachev. But at the sametime, Hanoi is eager to maintain economic ties with Moscow.   A Vietnamese source says that conservative leaders inHanoi may have been &quot;inwardly pleased&quot; by the coup, but thatnobody in Vietnam wanted to see instability and chaos developin the Soviet Union. Vietnam's trade with Moscow and EasternEurope dropped 85% in the first half of the year, leaving ahuge inventory of unsold goods. Possible civil war in theSoviet Union would have worsened that situation.   The Vietnamese source says that, if anything, the coupwill make Vietnam more determined to pursue its own courseand diversify foreign relations. But he expresses concernthat the impression that Hanoi sided with the coup couldcomplicate the normalization of U.S.-Vietnam ties.   North Korea, which also has been privately critical of Mr.Gorbachev's policies, took a cautious approach in its publicreaction to the coup. Pyongyang limited itself to briefreporting by its official news agency.   In Cambodia, Foreign Minister Hor Namhong said his countryhoped that &quot;the Soviet people will settle the problem bythemselves without any outside interference,&quot; adding thatevents in the Soviet Union wouldn't affect talks to settlethe Cambodian conflict.</TEXT></DOC>
