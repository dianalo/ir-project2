Clinical and animal data suggest that angiographic contrast mediamay potentiate the noxious effect of renal ischemia. In order to findout if cerebral angiography of cadaveric kidney donors prior to nephrectomyinterferes with function or survival of the renal grafts, two groupsof cadaveric donors were compared. One group had been exposed to constrastmedium from cerebral angiography in median 18 hours before nephrectomyand the other had not. There was no difference in graft survival andfunction between the two groups. In a previous investigation angiographywas performed two hours before explantation and in that investigationthere was a shorter graft survival in the angiography group than in acontrol group. A delay of 12 hours is suggested between cerebral angiographyand explantation, to decrease the combined harmful effects of contrastmedia and ischemia on renal grafts.</TEXT></DOC>
