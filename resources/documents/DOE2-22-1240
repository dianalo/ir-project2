Darkvolt-ampere characteristics and spectra of photosensitivity of CdS/CuInSe/sub2/ and CdSe/CuInSe/sub 2/ heterojunctions at T=300 K are given. Heterojunctioncharacteristic properties are considered immediately after semiconductor2-4 layer coatings obtained as a result of further recrystallizationannealing carried out at T=270-400 deg C and t=5-30 min. Economical efficiencyand technological effectiveness of the chemical deposition method forformation of rectifying heterojunctions being photosensitive in the widerange of wave lengths are pointed.</TEXT></DOC>
