Until Monday, officials had denied those reports.   But although MITI officials now acknowledge they're&quot;looking into&quot; proposals to lower the ceiling, they're stilltight-lipped about the number of vehicles by which they mightdo so.   If MITI persuades Japan's makers to accept morerestrictive export limits, it would be for the first timesince the annual ceiling was adopted in 1981.   The car makers agreed on an annual export limit of 2.3million vehicles for the fiscal year ending March 31. Thatlevel is higher than the original 1981 ceiling, which was1.86 million vehicles.   Japan's passenger-car exports to the U.S. in the yearended March 31, 1991, were 1.84 million vehicles, slightlybelow the level allowed by the voluntary restraints.</TEXT></DOC>
