About 20 officials of the Agency for National Security Planning,South Korea's main intelligence agency, boarded a Northwest Orientflight from Tokyo and arrested Rev. Moon Ik-hwan on charges ofviolating national security laws. Moon's companion, Yoo Won-ho, wasalso arrested.   Moon was led down a stairway on to the tarmac after agentspounded on one of the plane's door, demanding it be opened. The71-year-old dissident was quickly driven away in a black car asintelligence agents ringed the area.   About 4,000 riot policemen ringed Kimpo airport to preventradicals from greeting Moon and arrested about 60 dissidents andstudents who yelled slogans and unfurled banners after sneakinginto the terminal.   Moon created a major political controversy in the south bymaking a secret visit to North Korea last month to meet withcommunist leader Kim Il Sung to discuss ways to reunite the dividedKorean peninsula.   The government ordered a major crackdown on dissidents and thevisit threatened to stall peace talks between the two Koreas.   South Koreans cannot visit the north without governmentpermission.   Thousands of radical students staged violent protests in atleast five cities in support of Moon, clashing with riot policewhen they were blocked from marching off campuses. Police said theyhad no figures on how many students took part, but Korean pressreports said about 10,000 students protested at 23 collegesnationwide.   Police detained about 700 radicals who tried to get to YonseiUniversity in Seoul for a rally to welcome Moon, police said.Another 50 students were arrested when about 1,000 protestersmarched out of the campus peacefully and police armored vans firedtear gas.   Students at four other colleges in Seoul hurled firebombs androcks at police who fired tear gas and hurled rocks back in clashesaround the campuses. About 3,000 students clashed with police inthe southern port of Pusan, some 2,000 students fought police inKwangju in the south and violent clashes were also reported inTaegu and Chunchon.   ``Murderer (President) Roh Tae-woo cannot arrest Moon Ik-hwan!''students yelled.   South Korean officials said North Korea's dealings with Moonwere an attempt to undermine the Seoul government's authority. Theysay Moon and other dissidents are aiding North Korean attempts togain control of the peninsula.   Prosecutors said Moon would be charged with visiting North Koreato receive instructions from a hostile government and for``praising anti-state elements.'' If convicted, Moon could faceanywhere from five years in prison to the death sentence, althoughthere is little chance he would be executed.   The two Koreas have been bitter rivals since the Koreanpeninsula was divided after World War II ended in 1945. North Koreainvaded the south in 1950 at the start of the bloody three-yearKorean War.   Many South Koreans were outraged when state television showedpictures of Moon embracing Kim Il Sung and complimenting thecommunist strongman for his leadership. Kim is feared and hated inthe south for having ordered the 1950 invasion and many SouthKoreans fear the totalitarian north still wants to conquer thesouth.   Moon's visit to North Korea appears to have damaged SouthKorea's dissident movement by linking it to the north. North.Dissident leaders publicly have defended Moon's trip but privatelyconcede it has damaged their credibility.   The dissidents and radical students have been waging a violentcampaign to try and oust the Roh government. They have littlepublic support, but their frequent demonstrations have causedwidespread concern about South Korea's political stability.   Dissidents deny they are pro-North Korea, but many insist thetwo Koreas must be reunited immediately and differences in the twonation's political systems be resolved later.   The government used Moon's visit to order a series of crackdownson the dissidents. Five senior dissident leaders have been arrestedas part of the crackdown and police have taken tougher measuresagainst violent protests.</TEXT></DOC>
