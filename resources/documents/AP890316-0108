The opening volley was fired Thursday when more than 100 Housemembers, most allied with environmental groups, introducedlegislation to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions by more than 40percent and nitrogen oxide emissions by about half that amount. Thegases are the two major components of acid rain.   The bill drew expected, strong support from environmental groups,but was quickly opposed by the coal, auto and electric utilitiesindustries, which have fought environmentalists to an expensive drawsince the Reagan administration took office in 1981.   ``This is the year for clean air,'' said Rep. Gerry Sikorski,D-Minn., a sponsor of the legislation along with Reps. Henry Waxman,D-Calif., and Silvio Conte, R-Mass. He cited the ``new attitude'' ofPresident Bush compared to that of former President Reagan, and``increased public awareness and concern about our environment.''   Environmental groups cite Bush's promise to solve the acid rainproblem, made during a trip to Canada last month, as one of twopolitical developments that signal the battle may be near an end.The other is the levation to majority leader of Sen. George J.Mitchell, D-Maine, who sponsored last year's clean-air legislationin that chamber.   ``For industry, I think they know the `no-bill' option is prettywell off the table,'' said Alexandra Allen, attorney for the U.S.Public Interest Research Group, a private environmental lobbyingorganization.   Ron Sykes, senior Washington represenative of General MotorsCorp., acknowledged, ``The pressures for doing something this yearare considerably more than they were last year.''   But Sykes said ``we seem to be charging down a path that isdriven by what we've learned in the early years'' about acid rain,and ``not what we're about to learn'' from a 10-year federal studyscheduled for completion in mid-1990.   He suggested the nation wait for the study, a recommendation thatReagan supported but Bush rejected in Canada.   Gayla Hoffman, a spokeswoman for the nation's largest coalproducer, Peabody Holding Co. of St. Louis, said her company ``isopposed to additional controls beyond those already in place in theClean Air Act.''   And Diane Smiroldo, a spokeswoman for Edison Electric Institute,representing the nation's electric utilities, said that ``thecurrent Clean Air Act is working'' and that ``any legislation atthis point is premature.''   Acid rain and another aspect of the clean air debate _ dirty aircaused by ozone and carbon monoxide _ have been among the mostheavily lobbied issues in Congress.   According to records on file in the House and Senate, Citizensfor Sensible Control of Acid Rain was the top lobbying spender in1986. The organization, bankrolled principally by electric utilitiesand coal companies, spent $3,028,235 on behalf of a grassrootsdirect mail campaign opposing legislation mandating stricter acidrain emissions. Acid rain legislation did not get near the floorthat year.   But that figure did not include spending by individualautomakers, lectric utilities and chemical and coal companies andtheir trade associations, according to Ms. Allen. She saidenvironmental lobbying groups spent only a fraction of industryexpenditures.   The industry groups also have had strong allies in Congress: theHouse Energy and Commerce chairman, Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., andthe former Senate majority leader, Sen. Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va.   The House bill would require that sulfur dioxide emissions bereduced by 10 million tons and nitrogen oxide emissions by 4 milliontons by 1998. Currently, an estimated 22 million tons of sulfurdioxide and 21 million tons of nitrogen oxide are being emitted intothe air.   The two gases are converted in the atmosphere into acids, whichtravel far from their starting points to pollute lakes and forestsand, according to some health experts, cause serious respiratoryproblems for asthmatics, children and the elderly.   The leading sources of sulfur dioxide are coal-burning electricpower plants and industrial facilities. Nitrogen oxides are emittedin approximately equal amounts by motor vehicles and industry.   Congress has been divided along regional lines. The Northeast,the primary victim of acid rain, wants immediate action. Midwesternstates, with many older, coal-fired power plants, fear controls thatwill boost electric bills.   States that produce large amonts of high-sulfur coal _ Indiana,Illinois, Ohio, West Virginia and Pennsylvania _ worry that controlswill cause massive job losses in the coal industry.   The West, where low-sulfur coal is mined and acid rain is not aserious problem, is reluctant to pay the cost for new controls.   Under the new House bill:   _Electric utilities would receive federal subsidies to protectresidential customers from rate hikes of more than 10 percent as aresult of the sulfur dioxide controls.   _Motor vehicle manufacturers would be required to tightentailpipe standards for nitrogen oxide and hydrocarbons.   _The EPA would be required to control hydrocarbon vapors byrequiring onboard vehicle canisters or controls at the gas pump.Sykes said the canisters are unsafe, and could cause fires incrashes, in hot weather, and if a leak develops in the emissionssystem.</TEXT></DOC>
