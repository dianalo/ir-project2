The Copyright Office announces the following policy decisions. First, withrespect to specialty stations, the Office is adopting procedures whereby,through a combination of television broadcaster affidavits and public comment,an updated, annotated specialty station list will be established and amendedperiodically as stations qualify or cease to qualify as specialty stationsunder former FCC rules [47 CFR 76.5(kk)] in effect on June 24, 1981. Second,with respect to significantly viewed status, the Copyright Office has decidedthat the effective date is the date the FCC issues its determination thata particular television station is significantly viewed, but in the firstaccounting period when this decision is made, such broadcast signal willbe treated as a local signal under the cable compulsory license for theentire accounting period. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>EFFECTIVE DATE: </T2>September 18, 1989. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2>Dorothy Schrader, General Counsel,Copyright Office, Library of Congress, (202) 707-8380. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2><ITAG tagnum="84">1. Specialty Station Issue </ITAG>A. Background On February 18, 1987, the Copyright Office received from the Motion PictureAssociation of America, Inc. (``MPAA'') a request that the Copyright Officeissue a new listing of specialty stations because the list of specialtystations identified in 1976 by the Federal Communications Commission (``FCC'')is substantially out of date. Specialty station status is significant inthe administration of the cable compulsory license because a cable systemmay carry the signal of a television station classified as a specialtystation under the FCC's regulations in effect on June 24, 1981, at therelevant non-3.75% royalty rate for ``permitted'' signals. <T3>See </T3>49 FR 14944, 14951 (April 16, 1984), and section 111 of theCopyright Act of 1976, title 17 of the U.S. Code. In its request MPAA argued that since the time the Appendix B list of specialtystations was compiled at the FCC, the television industry has changed considerablyand that the changed circumstances compel reexamination of which stationsmeet the programming requirements for continued identification as specialtystations. The MPAA requested that the Copyright Office instigate the revisionand continued updating of the list so that the list reflects the currentspecialty programming broadcast by television stations. On March 18, 1987, the Copyright Office received from the Christian BroadcastingNetwork, Inc. (``CBN''), comments in opposition to MPAA's request. CBNargues that, in accordance with the terms of the Copyright Royalty Tribunal's(``CRT'') 1982 rate adjustment, the carriage by any cable system of anysignal lawfully permitted to be carried by a cable system on June 24, 1981,is exempt from the 3.75% rate, regardless of later changes in the natureof programming on that signal. As a rationale for this argument, CBN contendedthat ``the CRT regulation applies to signals, without regard to their content.''CBN also argued that its position is supported by the Copyright Officeinterpretation of the CRT rate adjustment expressed in the preamble tothe Office's April 16, 1984 interim regulations. 49 FR 14944, 14951. (CopyrightOffice found that ``the relevant non-3.75% rate applies to carriage ofan unlimited number of specialty stations identified as such as the FCCon June 24, 1981''). Finally, CBN argued that carriage by a cable system of the signal of astation that was a specialty station on June 24, 1981 can never be subjectto the 3.75% rate because the 3.75% rate adjustment can only apply to additionaldistant signal equivalents resulting from carriage of a formerly restrictedsignal. CBN reasoned that, since carriage of specialty station signalshad been permitted without limitation under the FCC's former distant signalcarriage rules, there cannot be an ``additional'' distant signal equivalentresulting from carriage of a specialty station as a result of the FCC's1980 cable deregulation, and the CRT does not have the authority to imposean increased royalty rate on carriage of a signal that qualified as a specialtystation on June 24, 1981. On February 25, 1988, the Copyright Office published a Notice of Inquiryto invite interested parties to address any issues relevant to the determinationof policy on how, for purposes of administering the cable compulsory license,the Office should determine the specialty station status of a particulartelevision broadcast station. [53 FR 5591] The Office indicated its initialagreement with the MPAA's position that specialty station status for purposesof applying the cable compulsory license should depend upon the currentspecialty programming broadcast by the station. This would give meaningto the FCC regulations in effect on June 24, 1981, which looked to a changinggroup of specialty stations as circumstances warranted, and which wereestablished to encourage cable systems to further the goal of diversityin programming for public benefit. The Office preliminary agreed that justas the cable compulsory license mechanism is flexible enough to respondto market changes and the existence of stations that newly become significantlyviewed in a particular community, so is it flexible enough to reflect thechanged status of a specialty or nonspecialty station. [53 FR 5592] However, the Office also indicated its reluctance to engage in specificprocedures for verifying the specialty status of particular stations. TheOffice believed such procedures would be costly to administer and wouldfurther involve the Office with responsibilities that may properly belongto the FCC. [53 FR 5592] The Office proposed, as an alternative to establishingverification procedures, a policy of accepting without question a claimfiled by a cable system that a particular station was carried on a specialtystation basis, so long as the statement of account is accompanied by aspecific affidavit in which the system operator swears that the stationso carried qualifies as such under the definition established by the formerFCC rules at 47 CFR 76.5(kk), in effect on June 24, 1981. B. Public Commentary Seven commentators address the specialty station issue. Of these seven,only two commentators, the representative of several cable systems andCBN, suggest that the FCC's specialty station list should not be changed.CBN's position did not change from its arguments made in opposition toMPAA's request. Rather than attempting to analyze or interpret the FCC'sformer specialty station policy, CBN's main focus is an analysis of theCRT's 3.75% rate adjustment and the Copyright Office's interpretation ofthat adjustment. CBN's main concern is that if a station formerly designatedas a specialty station and carried by systems at the base rate fee fordistant signals falls out of the specialty station classification, thesystem would have to apply the 3.75% rate for carriage of the signal eventhough the signal was being carried at the base rate fee prior to deregulation.The other commentator echoes this theme and argues that where a specialtystation does change format, it would be consistent with the FCC's policynot to displace stations to which cable subscribers have grown accustomedfor the Copyright Office to adopt a policy whereby ``stations [formerlyspecialty stations] which appear on Statements of Account are presumedexempt from the 3.75% penalty.'' (Comment No. 2 at 10.) This commentatordoes acknowledge that the FCC's specialty station policy anticipated thatsome stations would fall into and out of specialty station status. However,it argues that, in practice, the FCC never required deletion of a specialtystation which changed formats. One commentator declines to take a position on whether the FCC's specialtystation list should reflect updated information on the current programmingof the relevant stations. The remaining four commentators, including tworepresentatives of copyright owners and two broadcasters, all agree withthe Copyright Office's preliminary assessment that specialty station statusshould depend upon the current specialty programming broadcast by a station.The five commentators not affirmatively insisting that the specialty stationlist remain frozen in its 1,981 composition suggest three different alternativesby which the Copyright Office might resolve the specialty station issue.The first alternative is the Copyright Office affidavit proposal. Onlyone commentator representing copyright owners supports the Copyright Office'sproposal, with certain modifications. That commentator contends that theOffice should specify that a cable system must certify in the affidavitthat the station at issue carried the requisite specialty programming forat least one month during the relevant period. Under this proposal, toreceive the benefits of the lower rates applicable for carriage of a specialtystation, the cable system would be obliged to engage in the same kind ofprogramming review that was formerly undertaken by the FCC. This commentatorcontends that both the review procedure and the certification requirementshould be provided for in Copyright Office regulations. (Comment No. 8at 12-14) The other commentators (with the exception of CBN, which did not addressthe proposal) reject the Office's affidavit proposal because: (1) The FCC'sspecialty station rules provided that the burden was on parties opposingthe specialty station status of a particular station, and not the cablesystem carrying the station, to prove that a station lost its specialtystatus; thus, putting the burden of certifying the status on cable systemswould violate the FCC's policy; (2) the affidavit proposal would resultin multiple cable system responses for each alleged specialty station,some of which might conflict if indivdual system operators reach differentconclusions about the specialty status of the same station_and the potentialconflicts would not be resolved by the Office until some time after therelevant royalty payments are due; (3) cable systems are not in possessionof the best information as to whether a station qualifies as a specialtystation, and might have to rely on indirect and often inaccurate sourcessuch as programming guides; (4) it is burdensome for cable systems to filesuch an affidavit each accounting period_this is especially true in lightof the FCC's policy decision not to engage in annual review of its specialtystation list.The second proposal was offered jointly by MPAA and the National CableTelevision Association [``NCTA'']. Although the two commentators ``havedistinctly different views concerning the scope of the Copyright Office'sauthority to interpret and enforce the Copyright Act and to verify informationsubmitted in Statement of Account forms,'' (Comment No. 11, at 1), bothparties propose a cooperative, inter-industry approach to the specialtystations issue. They suggest that the MPAA and NCTA work together to preparean updated list identifying those stations whose programming currentlymeets the FCC's former definition of specialty station. They propose thatthey submit the list to the Copyright Office and that the Copyright Officepublish the list in the <T4>Federal Register.</T4>MPAA and NCTA contend that the purpose of the list would be informationalonly and that the list would not have the force of a Copyright Office regulation.Thus, they submit that if a cable operator characterizes as a specialtystation a signal not included on the most recently published list, theCopyright Office should question the characterization but accept the Statementof Account. Stations not contained on the MPAA-NCTA list could submit tothe Office an affidavit attesting to the fact that they currently offerprogramming which qualifies them for specialty status under the FCC's formerdefinition. MPAA suggests that the industries would make a general reviewof programming content every three or four years, but that in interim years,the office can rely on affidavits filed by individual stations that moveinto or out of specialty station status. MPAA and NCTA contend that thisalternative would put no administrative burden on the Copyright Office,but would provide a clear set of guidelines for cable systems and reducesubstantially the possibility of disputes about whether stations were properlyclassified on individual statements of account.The third alternative was raised by a broadcaster and supported by anotherbroadcaster. The broadcaster commenter proposes that the Copyright Officeissue a public notice inviting interested television station licenseesto respond with sworn affidavits indicating that in the preceding calendaryear the programming of their stations satisfied the requirements for specialtystation status. The Copyright Office could compile a list of the stationsclaiming specialty station status, publish the list in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>, and repeat the procedure in subsequent yearsto update the list. This commentator contends that such a lists would providevaluable information to the public while eliminating the necessity forcable system operators to provide duplicative or conflicting affidavits.It further claims that recourse would be available ``both criminally andcivilly against television licensees in the unlikely event that an affidavitcontained false information.'' (Comment No. 5 at 6.) The broadcaster commentatormaking these proposals would support the MPAA-NCTA suggestion as a secondchoice.C. Policy Decision The Copyright Office is convinced that the majority of commentators arecorrect: The Office should as a policy matter look to a station's currentprogramming content to determine whether it qualifies as a specialty stationunder the cable compulsory license. The Office disagrees with the two commentatorsthat contend that a station formerly qualifying as a specialty stationcan be carried at the base rate fee for distant signals after the stationloses its specialty status merely because no new DSE is created by theloss of that status. Although the Office does look first to actual carriageof a signal prior to June 25, 1981, as an indication of whether carriageis subject to the 3.75% rate, the Office will then look to see if carriageof the signal would have been permitted by the FCC on June 24, 1981, inthe same way as at the present time. Clearly under the FCC's former rules,if a station did not qualify as a specialty station at a given time, theFCC would (at least theoretically_no cases are found on either side ofthe issue) not consider the station to be a specialty station. That beingthe case, carriage of the signal would not have been permitted in the sameway by the FCC (prior to deregulation) as the system now intends to carryit (i.e. carriage as a non-specialty station), and the 3.75% fee shouldapply.The Office has decided that neither our initial proposal nor any of thethree alternatives for an updated classification of specialty stationsproposed by the commentator's should be adopted exactly as proposed. However,the Office has decided to adopt a solution that blends the MPAA-NCTA proposaland the broadcaster proposal. We have decided to reject our affidavit proposalbecause of all the reasons listed by the majority of commentators.While the MPAA-NCTA proposal has a very attractive feature_the agreementbetween the cable industry and copyright owners, their proposal does notrepresent the third interested group_broadcasters. Likewise, the broadcasterproposal does not give copyright owners or cable systems a public forumto register their views on which stations are specialty stations. Thus,the Office has adopted a policy that, in effect, merges their two proposedalternatives.The hybrid alternative would begin with the broadcaster proposal: the CopyrightOffice will today publish a Request for Information to solicit from eligibletelevision broadcast stations affidavits stating that in the precedingcalendar year the station qualified as a specialty station under the FCC'sspecialty station definition. When the affidavits are received the Officewill compile and publish a preliminary list of stations claiming specialtystation status.Going beyond the broadcaster proposal, the Office will both publish thelist and at the same time request interested parties to comment upon thelist. This will give MPAA and NCTA, cooperatively or separately, a chanceto publish their views as to the accuracy of the list, inluding their viewson whether particular stations on the preliminary list do not in fact qualifyas specialty stations as well as their views on whether stations not onthe preliminary list do so qualify. The Office will then publish an annotatedlist of stations claiming specialty status that includes references notingany public objections to a station's claim. With such an annotated liston the public record, cable systems can make an informed decision as towhether the MPAA or any other party might contest the system's carriageof a particular station on a specialty basis.The Office will repeat this procedure every three years upon the formalrequest of an interested party. In the interim period, the Office willaccept affidavits from stations that claim specialty status and use thoseaffidavits to update its list of specialty stations in accordance withMPAA's suggestion.As a policy matter, Copyright Office licensing examiners will use the annotatedlist in the same way they have used the FCC's 1981 list. If a cable systemclaims specialty station status for a station not on the list, the examinerwill look to see if the station has filed an affidavit since publicationof the list. Likewise, if the system claims specialty station status fora station that is annotated on the list to show that its specialty stationstatus is contested, then the examiner will inform the system by letterthat the particular party objects to the specialty characterization.This policy meets the Copyright Office's concern for administrative efficiency,gives all parties an opportunity to share their views with the public,gives NCTA and MPAA a chance to cooperate in their assessment of station'sspecialty station status, and allows new broadcast stations an opportunityto serve the public by broadcasting specialty progamming while also havingthe opportunity to be carried by cable systems at the base rate.<ITAG tagnum="84">2. The Significantly Viewed Station Issue</ITAG>A. BackgroundUnder the FCC's must-carry rules in effect until 1985, cable systems wererequired to carry on a must-carry basis the signals of commercial broadcaststations that were significantly viewed in communities in which the systemswere operating. 47 CFR 76.57(a)(4), 76.59(a)(6), 76.61(a)(5)(1982). Becauseof their former must-carry status under communications law, significantlyviewed signals are considered local signals under the definition of ``localservice area of a primary transmitter'' in section 111(f) of the CopyrightAct. Thus, a cable system's carriage of a significantly viewed signal doesnot incur distant signal royalty liability under the cable compulsory license.Until the invalidation of the FCC's pre-1986 must-carry rules,\1\<NOTE/> the Copyright Office's Licensing Division examiners verifiedthe significantly viewed status of stations in the community of a particularcable system by first referring to Television Digest's <T3>Cable and Station Coverage Atlas</T3> for the relevant year. If a systemclaimed significantly viewed status for a station not listed as significantlyviewed in the <T3>Atlas,</T3> the examiner would ask the cable system to provide evidencethat the FCC considered the station significantly viewed. The FCC generallyissued a notice of the significant viewership of a station in a particulararea.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ See <T3>Quincy Cable TV, Inc.</T3> v. <T3>FCC,</T3> 766 F.2d 1434 (D.C. Cir. 1958), <T3>cert. denied sub nom.</T3> <T3>National Ass'n of Broadcasters</T3> v. <T3>Quincy Cable TV, Inc,</T3> 106 S.Ct. 2889 (1986). A second set of modifiedmust-carry rules has also been invalidated by the court in <T3>Century Communications Corp.</T3> v.<T3> FCC,</T3> 836 F.2d 599 (DC Cir. 1987).At the time that the FCC's must-carry rules were first struck down by theUnited States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit inthe <T3>Quincy</T3> decision, the FCC was reluctant to offer any formal determinationson whether particular signals would have been considered must-carry signalsfor certain cable systems under the former rules. As a result, the CopyrightOffice received requests that the Office implement a new procedure fordetermining when a particular broadcast station is significantly viewed.Although the Commission has resumed its former practice on verificationof significant viewership, the FCC did cease making such verificationsfor some time, and the Copyright Office was concerned that the FCC mightcease to do so again.On February 25, 1988, the Copyright Office published a Notice of Inquiryto invite commentary on all issues relevant to the determination of policyon how, for purposes of administering the cable compulsory license, theCopyright Office should determine the significant viewership status ofa particular television broadcast station in a particular case. [53 FR5592] The Office specifically invited commentary on the issue of when significantlyviewed status arises for purposes of calculating royalties_at the timethe appropriate surveys are evaluated by some governmental authority, orat some other time. The Copyright Office has traditionally taken the viewthat significantly viewed status arises, for purposes of the cable compulsorylicense, at the time the FCC issues a formal determination of the significantlyviewed status of a particular television broadcast station in a particulararea.The Office also raised for comment an issue that arises when a station'ssignificantly viewed status changes in the middle of an accounting period:To what extent is carriage of the signal prior to the status change consideredcarriage of a distant signal? If the signal is carried for part of an accountingperiod on a ``distant'' basis prior to the change to significantly viewedstatus, should the DSE be applied for the entire accounting period pursuantto 37 CFR 201.17(h)(3)(i)?B. Public Commentary<ITAG tagnum="81">Determination of Significantly Viewed Status</ITAG>Five commentators, including two representing cable interests, one representingbroadcasters, one representing copyright owners, and the FCC, take theposition that the Copyright Office should not attempt to institute a procedurefor the determination of significantly viewed status. These parties notethat the FCC has been processing requests for determination of significantviewership since January of 1986 and that the FCC is unlikely to discontinuemaking such determinations because the significantly viewed standard isnow relevant under the FCC's regulations implementing the Cable CommunicationsPolicy Act of 1984,\2\<NOTE/> and it may be relevant under its syndicated exclusivity rules.\3\<NOTE/> The FCC itself states that, ``we intend within the budgetrestraint imposed on us all to continue to process such requests (for determinationof significantly viewed status) expeditiously.'' (Comment No. 7, p. 1.)<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ <T3>See </T3>47 CFR 76.33 (the ``effective competition rule''). One commentatornotes that the FCC recently announced that it would continue using theGrade B contour and the significant viewing concept as the measures ofsignal availability for determining whether a cable system faces effectivecompetition under the Cable Act (<T3>see FCC News Release No. 2259 </T3>(March 24, 1988). While the FCCaltered the basis upon which significant viewing is assessed in this context,to require viewership data in the cable community rather than, as specifiedin the 1976 rules, in the county of the cable systems, this commentatorargues there is no reason why the FCC would not continue to determine thesignificant viewing status on the basis of county data upon request. (CommentNo. 5, p. 7, n. 11.)<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ <T3>See </T3>47 CFR 76.92(f), Report and Order in FCC Gen. Docket No. 87-24Report and Order in FCC Gen. Docket No. 87-24 (Adopted May 18, 1988; effectiveAugust 18, 1989).In light of these facts, these commentators argue that the Copyright Officeshould allow the FCC to interpret its own technical rules \4\<NOTE/> to avoid ``an administrative nightmare'' that might leadto conflicting or duplicative rulings. The two cable interests taking thisviewpoint also argue that the Copyright Office does not have the authorityto regulate matters touching on communications policy.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ One commentator lists a number of acrane issues the FCCis routinely called upon to decide in determining significantly viewedstatus (i.e. has a statistically reliable survey been conducted on a community-by-communitybasis? has the applicant met standard duration requirements?) <T3>See</T3> Comment No. 2, pp. 2-4.Two commentators representing broadcasters submit that due to the uncertainfuture of official FCC verifications that a television station is significantlyviewed in a cable system's community or county, within the meaning of 47CFR 76.5(k), the Copyright Office should adopt a simple procedure to allowa cable system to aver that a television signal carried by the system issignificantly viewed. These parties contend that the Office should acceptthe claim of a cable system that a particular television station is carriedon a significantly viewed basis so long as the system's statement of accountis accompanied by an affidavit by the cable operator certifying that thestation meets the significantly viewed definition at 47 CFR 76.5(k). Athird commentator, representing copyright proprietors, urges us to adoptsuch a procedure only regarding ``those cases where the FCC has not madea [specific] determination [of significant viewing status].'' (CommentNo. 8 at 10.)<ITAG tagnum="81">Determination of When Significantly Viewed Status Arises for Purposesof the Calculation of Cable Compulsory License Royalties</ITAG>The commentators address the two aspects of this issue raised in the Noticeof Inquiry: (1) Whether significantly viewed status arises on the datethe first survey required by 47 CFR 76.54 is begun (assuming all criteriawere met by the later surveys), on the date the last survey so requiredis completed, or on the date the FCC makes a determination; and (2) whether,when the date that significant viewership status arises (as determinedin the above inquiry) falls in the middle of an accounting period, thesignificantly viewed signal should be considered as local for the entireaccounting period or distant for the entire accounting period.\5\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ Only one commentator suggested as an alternative solutionthat the signal should be considered distant for part of the accountingperiod and local for the other part. (Comment No. 1 at 15)Regarding the effective date of establishing significant viewing status,four commentators contend that significantly viewed status should ariseon a date that is linked to the timing of the surveys required by andSection;76.54 of the FCC's rules. A representative of cable interests argues thata station should be deemed significantly viewed ``for any accounting periodon which the significant viewing data is premised.'' (Comment No. 2 at6.) That commentator argues that such a policy would give meaning to theintention of the Act to exempt from royalties signals which are not carriedbeyond local viewing areas.Two commentators representing broadcast interests similarly contend that:<ITAG tagnum="21">Where (i) three consecutive audience surveys are taken in accordancewith the FCC's rule, and all three surveys demonstrate that a distant televisionsignal's viewership in the relevant county or community exceeds the levelsset forth in the FCC's rule, (ii) no survey results suggest actual viewershipat any time that falls below those levels, (iii) the surveys demonstrateactual viewership <T3>substantially </T3>in excess of those levels, and (iv) no questionis raised or challenge is lodged against the surveys or their methdology,then . . . the point in time at which significantly-viewed status attachesis no later than the conclusion of the final survey period, and shouldeven be considered to be at the commencement of the first survey period.</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">(Comment No. 1 at 10; Comment No. 4.)NCTA would appear to take a similar view.\6\<NOTE/> The quoted commentator reasons that if the survey resultsestablish the existence of the fact in question, i.e. significant viewership,then a delay in a governmental agency's issuance of its acknowledgementof that fact should not have the effect of delaying the benefits to privateparties that flow from the earlier-arising existence and proof of the fact.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\ NCTA states that ``where a station's significantly viewedstatus is based on viewership surveys taken during the middle of an accountingperiod, the station will be deemed a `local' station for that entire accountingperiod.'' (Comment No. 6 at 10.) This suggests NCTA would base status onthe timing of the surveys, but does not specify whether status should ariseat the commencement of the first survey or the conclusion of the last.The FCC and two commentators representing copyright owners contend thatsignificantly viewed status should arise for copyright purposes on thedate the FCC makes its determination. None of these parties gives a rationalefor this position, nor attempts to rebut in reply comments the positionof the cable and broadcaster commentators.Regarding the second aspect of the date issue, seven of the eight partiescommenting in this proceeding agree that when the date that a signal'ssignificantly viewed status arises falls in the middle of an accountingperiod, the signal should be considered local for the entire accountingperiod. Only a commentator repesenting a copyright owner argues that sucha signal should be considered distant for the entire period. Two of theseven commentators contend more specifically that the Copyright Officeshould adopt a rebuttable presumption that the signal is local for theentire period. (Comment No. 1 at 14; Comment 9 at 4.) One commentator offersas a rationale for the majority view the fact that ``viewership levelssufficient to establish a station's signal as being significantly viewedare unlikely to have changed so dramatically in the course of a six-monthaccounting period, such that a signal determined to have been significantlyviewed at some point in the course of an accounting period was not enjoyingroughly equivalent levels of veiwership from the outset of the period.''\7\<NOTE/> (Comment No. 1 at 14-15.)<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\ This commentator suggests as an alternative that the CopyrightOffice prorate the cable system's royalty obligations for the accountingperiod in question, taking into account the fact that the carriage of thesignal on a distant basis ended on the date on which the signal's significantly-viewedstatus attached.To rebut the argument that carriage of a signal which is determined tobe significantly viewed in the middle of an accounting period should beconsidered distant for the entire period to avoid improper proration ofa DSE, the other commentator representing copyright owners states:<ITAG tagnum="21">[We agree] that a distant station carried during any part of an accountingperiod must be assigned full DSE value for the entire period. Creatinga limited presumption for the significantly viewed survey situation doesnot, in [our] view, erode the validity of the general rule, but ratherrecognizes that the significantly viewed survey results are the productof sustained levels of veiwership over time.</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">(Comment No. 9 at 4.)On the isue of the effective date of significant viewership in general,broadcaster commentator relates its own experience by way of example forits views. The commentator owns and operates a UHF commerical televisionbroadcasting station located in Omaha, Nebraska. The station first signedon the air on April 6, 1986 and covered much of Lancaster County, Nebraska.The commentator believed it was vital to the economic success of the stationat issue to be carried on a Cablevision cable system serving Lincoln, thesecond largest city in its signal carriage area. However, under the FCC'sformer distant signal carriage rules, the station would not be a must-carrysignal to the Lincoln system unless it was significantly viewed in Lincoln.The commentator thus agreed to indemnify the system for copyright royaltyliability the system accrued for carriage of the station until such timeas it was declared significantly viewed in Lincoln.The commentator arranged for the A.C. Nielson Company to make the appropriatesurveys. Nielson scheduled surveys in May, July, and November of 1986.Throughout the period, the commentator's independent research determinedthat the station's signal was being viewed in Lancaster County at levelswell in excess of the FCC's requirements for significantly viewed status.This was confirmed by Nielson's report rendered on December 15, 1986. Thecommentator filed the report with the FCC on December 18, 1986. The FCCdeclared the station significantly viewed in Lancaster County on January21, 1987.This commentator argues that since Nielson data demonstrated that the stationwas in fact significantly viewed in Lincoln as early as May of 1986, itis unfair that the station's signal should be considered distant to theLincoln system in accounting periods 1986-1, 1986-2 and 1987-1 for purposesof computng royalties under the cable compulsory license.C. Policy DecisionThe Copyright Office agrees with the majority of commentators (five outof eight) that the Office should not attempt to institute a new procedurefor the determination of significantly viewed status since the FCC hasapparently resumed making determinations of significant viewership statusand plans to continue doing so in the future.The Office has decided to look to the date the FCC issues its determinationthat a particular station is significantly viewed in the community of aparticular cable system as the relevant date for determining a cable system'scopyright liability for carrying a signal on a significantly-viewed basis.Although we are sympathetic to the argument that a signal is actually ``local''for copyright purposes as soon as the surveys establish that it meets theFCC's standards because the signal was in fact only delivered with a standardviewing area (and not a ``distant'' area), the Office concludes that thestation could not have insisted upon its signal being carried by the systemunder the FCC's former rules until the date the FCC issued its determinationof significantly viewed status.\8\<NOTE/> This rationale is consistent with the Copyright Officer'sinterpretation of the definition of ``local service'' area under section111(f) and the FCC's former must-carry rules. the Office adopted that interpretationat least as early as 1984 when we recieved questions concerning implementationof the CRT's 3.75% rate adjustment.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\8\ This policy is advisable since, as one commentator pointedout in the context of arguing that the FCC should make the determination,the FCC ``is routinely called upon to rule upon arcane issues within thepeculiar expertise of the FCC.'' (Comment No. 2, 3.) Thus, while surveysare important to the determination, other factors that the FCC might considercould influence the FCC's decision, and only that decision itself rendersthe station a significantly viewed station.However, the Office agrees with the majority of commentators (Seven outof eight) that if the FCC determines that a particular signal is significantlyviewed in an area served by a particular cable system in the middle ofan accounting period, the system should be able to report the signal as``local'' for the entire accounting period. This decision does not detractfrom the general rule that a full DSE must be paid for carriage of a distantsignal at any time during an accounting period.The decision represents a limited presumption that by the time the FCCmakes its significantly viewed determination, the signal was de facto alocal signal for many months. This limited presumption seems justifiedto avoid penalizing cable system and broadcaster interests for any delayin processing significantly viewed petitions. The presumption does notmaterially harm copyright owner interests (as one such commentator recognized)since, by adopting the FCC's determination as the effective date of significantviewership, copyright owners in effect get the benefit of the latest possibledate for the change from distant to local status. Only on accounting periodis affected under our decision, even though the surveys may cover 2 ormore accounting periods.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: August 28, 1989</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Ralph Oman,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Register of Copyrights.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Approved by:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">James H.
