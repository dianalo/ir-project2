FRAZIER</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Panama's economy is holding togethermore than a year after the United States imposed sanctions on thePanamanian government, but increasingly it is a hand-to-mouth,day-to-day brand of surival.   The sanctions imposed in March and April of last year wereintended to force the departure of Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, thede facto ruler of Panama who has been indicted in the United Stateson drug trafficking charges.   Noriega, chief of the Panamanian Defense Forces, remains verymuch in charge as Sunday's presidential election approaches. TheUnited States and opposition figures accuse the government ofplanning to cheat to give Noriega's candidate victory.   The sanctions froze about $56 million in Panamanian governmentdeposits in American banks and banned payments of taxes and someother fees to entities of the Panamanian government.   The United States also is holding about $140 million in withheldPanama Canal payments in the name of Eric Delvalle, deposed byNoriega in March 1988 and still recognized by the United States asthe president of Panama.   Bank deposits here are down sharply, huge sums have left thecountry, savings accounts remain frozen and a shortage of cash hascut sharply into loan availability, which means new development andconstruction are way down.   Ironically, the survival of the economy is due in considerablepart to what the United States and U.S. businesses spend here _about $500 million a year, not counting the military payroll for10,000 Southern Command troops and payrolls and expenditures ofseveral large American companies.   The businesses include a Texaco refinery, the trans-Panama oilpipeline and the Cherokee Land Co., a banana-growing concern thatcontinues to export bananas but because of the sanctions does notpay the government export taxes of about $1 million a month.   The $500 million, most of it related to the Panama Canal, isabout 12 percent of Panama's gross domestic product. A large shareof that could be lost to Panama if the United States furthertightens the sanctions.   The government is blaming nearly all of its problems on thesanctions, although the economic decline actually started inmid-1987, when Panamanians worried about political instabilitystarted sending money out of the country.   By Panamanian government figures, the gross domestic productdropped about 17.1 percent in 1988, from $5 billion to about $4.1billion; American economists contend only about a fourth of thedrop is due to the sanctions.   Between June of 1987 and December of 1988 internal bank depositswere down from $4.4 billion to $2.8 billion, indicating capitalflight of about $1.6 billion.   Time deposits have been frozen and speculators have done a briskbusiness buying them up for cash at a discount in hopes theyeventually will be released.   Panama, which uses the American dollar, has no central bank andcannot print more money unless it establishes its own currency,which then would be subject to heavy inflationary pressures.   In a statement published Wednesday, the government's NationalBanking Commission said the situation had hit bottom and wasstarting to improve slightly, especially with foreign deposits inPanamanian banks.   But the commission said the banking system has a long way to gobefore returning to where it was before the crisis.   ``It still is necessary to increase the availability of loanfunds in banks. And this can be achieved if we Panamanians keep ourfunds in banks in Panama,'' it said.   It predicted that the opposition will refuse to accept defeat inSunday's presidential election and resort to violence and, for thatreason, the commission could not assure that savings accounts wouldbe freed in June as had been predicted.   Unemployment in Panama is put at about 20 percent, but thatfigure does not take into account the partial employment andunder-employment brought about by sanction-related stagnation.   Normally in Latin America repatriation of capital flight followsa period of political stability, something Panama may not see for atime. Panama has suspended payment of its considerable domestic andforeign debt, which once took about 40 percent of the nationalbudget.   A Panamanian government assessment of damages from thesanctions, published in February, said $77.8 million in loanagreements and donations for development projects had beencancelled by the U.S. Agency for International Development.   The government's income was down 44 percent, the study said. Thenumber of Panamanians below the poverty line, it said, has risenfrom about 33 percent to 40 percent.</TEXT></DOC>
