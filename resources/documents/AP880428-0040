SCHMID</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The world population could double to more than10 billion people within four decades, say researchers who contendprevious predictions of a slowdown appear to be wrong.   ``The overall world population is growing faster than had beenprojected in the late 1970s and early '80s,'' said Carl Haub of theprivate Population Reference Bureau.   The next billion could be added by 1998, said Haub, adding,``That's really fast.''   The World Population Data Sheet, issued Wednesday by the bureau,said the doubling would occur if world population continues to growat the current rate of 1.7 percent.   It took all of human history to raise the world's population to1 billion, which occurred in the early 1800s _ during thepresidency of Thomas Jefferson.   More than a century was required to add the second billion, byabout 1930, according to the United Nations Fund for PopulationActivities. Three billion were here by 1964, 4 billion in 1974 and5 billion in 1987.   There is a perception that world population growth was a problemof the 1970s, Haub observed in a telephone interview, ``so wethought it was time to point out that it's still growing fasterthan had been projected.''   The 1.7 percent rate of annual growth given by the Bureau, anindependent, non-profit research group, is slightly higher than the1.6 percent projected by the United Nations.   ``That doesn't sound like much,'' Haub pointed out. But in aworld of 5 billion people, that difference represents 5 millionmore people per year.   Population growth hasn't followed the smooth trend downward thathad been expected in many developing nations, Haub said. He notedin particular that China, India, Pakistan and Iran have high growthrates.   ``Some of the larger countries have not followed a nice smoothpath to the two-child family that we have been predicting,'' saidHaub, noting in particular China and India, where previousreductions in births have not been maintained.   The doubling of the world population in 40 years depends ongrowth continuing at the 1.7 percent ate, Haub said, a rate thatvaries considerably from country-to-country and region-to-region.   The more developed nations, for example, are growing at 0.6percent annually, for an anticipated doubling time of 120 years,the Population Data Sheet shows. On the other hand, the lessdeveloped nations could double in just 33 years, at a growth rateof 2.1 percent.   Increasing fastest are Kenya and the disputed territory of Gaza,currently occupied by Israel, each of which is expected to doubleits population in just 17 years at current rates of increase.   At the other end of the scale, five countries are not growing atall _ Austria, Denmark, Hungary, East Germany and West Germany. AndItaly, at its current rate, would not double its population for3,465 years.   Changes are hard to anticipate as various nations progresseconomically toward what population experts call the demographictransition.   In early societies, high birth rates are generally balanced highdeath rates. As economic conditions provide better medical care andnutrition, death rates fall while birth rates remain high, leadingto rapid population growth.   Eventually, history shows, birth rates also begin to fall in atransition to balance again, as has happened in many more developednations.   Social, religions and other differences from nation to nation,however, keep this change from being a smooth curve, and help leadto the many variations around the world.</TEXT></DOC>
