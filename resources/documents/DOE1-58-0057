Expert plant management requires aconstant surveillance of plant operating conditions to identify unnecessaryenergy losses, analyze trends and provide an engineering data base forintelligent control and decision making. There are many advantages tothis system; primary among them are energy savings and manpower costreductions. The microprocessor and telecommunications capabilities whichare now available, can provide more information about the plant's operationson instant call-up than a full time team of on site engineers can presentlyprovide. The computer can quickly reduce and process data that otherwisewould take weeks of work to analyze. With this system, a small team ofengineers, such as corporate engineering section or consulting engineeringgroup, operating from their home office can monitor and assist a largenumber of plants anywhere in the world in just seconds. Modern advancesin computer technology can now provide information that would have beenimpossible just a few years ago. It is a powerful new tool for the EnergyManager which can significantly improve the economics of operating boilerplants and other energy conversion processes.</TEXT></DOC>
