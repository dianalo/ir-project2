The practices complained of are, <T3>inter alia, </T3>subsidies provided to the EC processors of oilseedsthat encourage purchase of EC oilseeds to the detriment of imports of oilseeds,particularly soybeans, from the United States. On January 5, 1988, the USTR initiated an investigation of these practicesand requested consultations with the EC, as required by section 303(a)of the Trade Act, 19 U.S.C. 2413. Consultations were held between representativesof the United States and the EC on January 26, 1988, February 19, 1988,and April 19, 1988. These consultations failed to result in the partiesreaching a mutually satisfactory resolution of the issues. Thus, on May4, 1988, the United States requested the Contracting Parties of the GeneralAgreement on Tariffs and Trade to establish a dispute settlement panelto consider the matter. The EC did not accede to the United States' requestuntil June 16, 1988 and did not agree to composition of the panel untilMay 19, 1989. The panel held its organizational meeting on May 31, 1989,and will hold its first meeting with the parties on June 27, 1989.
