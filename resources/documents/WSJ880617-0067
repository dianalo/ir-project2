A major thrust of the legislation is to move recipients into the work force. And in a surprise move last evening, the Senate adopted an amendment backed by the president that would require at least one parent in a two-parent family receiving welfare to take a job in community service for 16 hours a week.    Prior to adopting the amendment, Senate leaders had devised a compromise that moved part way toward the president's position, altering the bill approved earlier by the Senate Finance Committee to include several inducements to welfare recipients to work.    But yesterday the Senate took the extra step to make the work requirement even stricter, and GOP senators said the president is likely to accept the legislation if it reaches his desk in that form.    &quot;This bill would be signed by this White House,&quot; said Sen. Daniel Moynihan, (D., N.Y.), the measure's principal author. The bill, he said, transforms federal welfare law from a program that was originally for widows into one that is &quot;first of all, a child-support program.&quot;    Hurdles still remain, however. A different and more costly version of the bill passed by the House in December doesn't contain the work requirement, and that bill must be reconciled with the Senate's. What's more, the nation's governors, an important interest group for the legislation, oppose the work measure. And the House bill provides incentives that would increase benefits to welfare recipients, unlike the Senate bill.    Last evening, the Senate declined, 54-41, to table the amendment backed by the president. The provision was then adopted by voice vote, and the Senate went on to approve the five-year, $2.8 billion legislation on a bipartisan 93-3 vote. It now goes to a House-Senate conference committee.    The Senate bill would replace the decades-old Aid to Families with Dependent Children program with a new one requiring many recipients to work, go to school or receive job training to keep their benefits.    Under the bill, states would offer assistance with child care, transportation and job placement and would be required to extend at least limited benefits to two-parent families in which both parents are unemployed. The bill also would toughen child-support collection measures by requiring states to deduct payments from parents' paychecks, beginning in 1994.    The legislation pays for itself mostly by expanding an existing Internal Revenue Service program under which debts to the federal government may be deducted from tax refunds, raising $2 billion for the welfare programs over five years.    The remaining $800 million was essentially left up in the air. The Senate adopted by voice vote a cleverly proposed amendment by Sen. Bill Bradley (D., N.J.) that would raise that amount by phasing out the income tax deduction for meals and entertainment for individuals with annual incomes of more than $360,000. The Bradley plan replaced one contained in the House bill that would have begun to phase out the existing tax credit for child-care expenses for those earning more than $70,000 a year and eliminating it for those earning more than $97,500. These numbers are for adjusted gross income.    Lawmakers don't expect the expense-account deduction to survive in the final version of the bill. But by proposing it, Sen. Bradley succeeded in casting doubt on whether the plan to phase out the child-care credit would be adopted.    Lloyd Bentsen (D., Texas), chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, voiced reservations about the Bradley approach and said he might work to discard it during the House-Senate conference. </TEXT></DOC>
