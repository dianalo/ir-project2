The ProposedDecision relates to an April 18, 1987 Consent Order between the DOE andLone Star Oil and Chemical Company (Lone Star). The Consent Order resolvescertain disputes between the firm and the DOE concerning Lone Star's possibleviolations of DOE regulations in its sales of crude oil. The settlementagreement covers the period June 1978 through January 1980. The Proposed Decision sets forth the procedures and standards that theDOE has tentatively formulated to distribute the contents of an escrowaccount in the amount of $184,267.15, funded by Lone Star pursuant to theConsent Order. The determination proposes that the money be placed intoa pool of crude oil moneys for distribution pursuant to the DOE's ModifiedStatement of Restitutionary Policy for crude oil claims. Any member of the public may submit written comments regarding the proposedrefund procedures. Such parties are requested to submit two copies of theircomments. Comments should be submitted within 30 days of publication ofthis notice. All comments received in this proceeding will be availablefor public inspection between 1:00 and 5:00 p.m., Monday through Friday,except Federal holidays, in the Public Reference Room of the Office ofHearings and Appeals, located in Room 1E-234, 1000 Independence AvenueSW., Washington, DC 20585.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: November 16, 1988. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">George B.

On March 10, 1988, the Economic Regulatory Administration (ERA) of theDepartment of Energy (DOE) filed a Petition for the Implementation of SpecialRefund Procedures (Petition) with the Office of Hearings and Appeals (OHA).In the Petition, the ERA requests that the OHA formulate and implementprocedures for distributing funds obtained through the settlement of enforcementproceedings involving the DOE and Lone Star Oil and Chemical Company. 10CFR Part 205, Subpart V.\1\<NOTE/> This Proposed Decision sets forth the OHA's tentative planfor distributing these funds to qualified refund applicants. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ Lone Star Oil and Chemical Company was a sole proprietorshipowned by Michael A. McAlister. Accordingly, Michael A. McAlister was personallyliable for the violations alleged against Lone Star Oil and Chemical Company.Lone Star Oil and Chemical Company and Michael A. McAlister will be collectivelyreferred to as Lone Star throughout the rest of this Proposed Decisionand Order. During the period June 1978 through January 1980, Lone Star was a ``reseller''of crude oil as that term is defined in 10 CFR 212.31. Lone Star was thereforesubject to the provisions of the Mandatory Petroleum Price Regulations.10 CFR Part 212. The ERA conducted an extensive audit of Lone Star's operationsand found in a Proposed Remedial Order (PRO) that the firm had violatedapplicable DOE pricing regulations in its sales of crude oil. The PRO wasissued as a final Remedial Order (RO) by the OHA on August 26, 1986. <T3>Lone Star Oil and Chemical Company/Michael A. McAlister, </T3>14 DOEandpara; 83,044 (1986). Lone Star filed an appeal of the RO on October 10,1986. <T3>appeal docketed </T3>No. 86-35-000 (FERC October 10, 1986).In order to settle the claims and disputes between Lone Star and the DOEthat were raised in the RO, the two parties entered into a Consent Orderon April 18, 1987 (the Consent Order).\2\<NOTE/> In accordance with the terms of the Consent Order, Lone Starpaid $184,267.15 to the DOE on February 8, 1988. The Consent Order doesnot make any provision for the distribution of the funds remitted by LoneStar. In its Petition, the ERA states that it has been unable to identifypersons injured by the overcharges or the amount that any individual maybe entitled to receive. In accordance with the provisions of 10 CFR SubpartV, the ERA therefore requests that the OHA establish appropriate proceduresfor the distribution of the funds remitted by Lone Star. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ Under the provisions of the Consent Order, Lone Star agreedto withdraw its RO appeal and waived its right to further administrativeappeal or any judicial review of the RO. <T3>See Consent Order, </T3>andpara; 13. <ITAG tagnum="81">I. Proposed Refund Procedures </ITAG>On July 28, 1986, as a result of the court-approved Settlement Agreementin <T3>In Re: The Department of Energy Stripper Well Exemption Litigation,</T3>M.D.L. No. 378, the DOE issued a Modified Statement of RestitutionaryPolicy (MSRP) providing that crude oil overcharge or settlement revenueswill be divided among the States, the United States Treasury, and eligiblepurchasers of crude oil and refined products. 51 FR 27899 (August 4, 1986).Up to 20 percent of the crude oil violation or settlement amounts may bereserved to satisfy claims from injured parties that purchased refinedpetroleum products between August 19, 1973 and January 27, 1981 (the crudeoil price control period). The MSRP also calls for the remaining funds,after deducting the reserve, to be disbursed for indirect restitution.The MSRP states that this disbursement should be made both to the federalgovernment and to the 50 States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico,the Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa and the Northern Marianna Islands(the States). Accordingly, once all valid claims are paid, any remainingfunds will be divided equally between the federal government and the States.The federal government's share of the unclaimed funds will ultimately bedeposited into the general fund of the Treasury of the United States. The Lone Star funds are subject to the MSRP. Therefore, we propose to institutea claims process for the $184,267.15 in funds involved in this proceeding.In the present case, we have decided to reserve the full 20 percent, or$36,853.43, of the alleged violation amount, plus a proportionate shareof the accrued interest, for direct restitution to claimants that purchasedrefined petroleum products during the crude oil price control period. Refundsto eligible claimants that purchased refined petroluem products will becalculated on the basis of a volumetric refund amount derived by dividingthe Lone Star refund pool of $184,267.15 by the total consumption of petroleumproducts in the United States during the crude oil price control period(2,020,997,335,000 gallons). <T3>Mountain Fuel Supply Co., </T3>14 DOE andpara; 85,475 at 88,867 (1986)(<T3>Mountain Fuel). </T3>This approach reflects the fact that crude oilovercharges were spread to every region by the Entitlements Program.\3\<NOTE/> The volumetric amount for the crude oil pool establishedin this proceeding is therefore $0.000000091176 per gallon of refined productspurchased ($184,267.15/2,020,997,335,000=$0.000000091176). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ The Department of Energy established the EntitlementsProgram to equalize access to the benefits of crude oil price controlsamong all domestic refiners and their downstream customers. To accomplishthis goal, refiners were required to make transfer payments among themselvesthrough the purchase and sale of entitlements to the lowest priced crudeoil. This balancing mechanism had the effect of evenly dispersing overchargesresulting from crude oil miscertifications throughout the domestic refiningindustry. <T3>See, e.g., Amber Refining, Inc., </T3>13 DOE andpara; 85,217 (1985).We propose that the remaining 80 percent of the funds, or $147,413.72,be disbursed equally to the federal government and to the States for indirectrestitution. We propose to direct the DOE's Office of the Controller toseparate and divide this amount, and to distribute $73,706.86 plus appropriateinterest to the States' crude oil tracking account \4\<NOTE/> and $73,706.86 plus appropriate interest to the federal government'scrude oil tracking account. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ The funds in the States' crude oil tracking account aredistributed to the 56 States, territories and possessions of the UnitedStates whenever the total amount of the account equals 10 million dollarsor as determined by the Director of the OHA. <ITAG tagnum="81">II. Proposed Presumptions Concerning Injury </ITAG>We propose that the process the OHA will use to evaluate claims based oncrude oil violations will be modeled after the process the OHA has usedto evaluate claims based on alleged refined product overcharges pursuantto 10 CFR Part 205, Subpart V. <T3>Mountain Fuel, </T3>14 DOE at 88,869. As in non-crude oil cases, applicantsgenerally are required to document their purchase volumes and to provethat they were injured by the alleged violations (<T3>i.e., </T3>that they did not pass through the alleged overcharges totheir customers). We propose to apply the standards for showing injurythat the OHA has developed in analyzing non-crude oil claims. <T3>See, e.g., Dorchester Gas Corp.,</T3> 14 DOE andpara; 85,240 (1986).There standards include a finding that end-users and ultimate consumerswhose businesses are unrelated to the petroleum industry were injured bya consent order firm's alleged overcharges. From our experience with SubpartV refund proceedings, we believe that potential claimants will fall intothe following categories: (1) End-users, <T3>i.e., </T3>consumers that used refined petroleum products; (2) regulatednon-petroleum industry entities that used Lone Star products in their businesses,or cooperatives that purchased Lone Star products for their businesses;and (3) refiners, resellers or retailers that resold refined petroleumproducts.We further propose to adopt certain presumptions that will permit claimantsto participate in the refund process without incurring inordinate expenseand will enable the OHA to consider refund applications in the most efficientmanner possible. <T3>American Pacific International,</T3> 14 DOE andpara; 85,158 (1986). First,we propose to adopt a presumption that the alleged overcharges were dispersedequally in all sales of refined products made during the crude oil pricecontrol period and that refunds should therefore be made on a pro rataor volumetric per gallon basis. In the absence of better information, avolumetric refund assumption is sound because the DOE price regulationsgenerally required a regulated firm to account for increased costs on afirm-wide basis in determining its prices. We also propose to adopt a number of injury presumptions that will simplifyand streamline the refund process. We will discuss these presumptions andthe showing that each type of applicant must make in Section II (A) below.(A) <T3>Specific Application Requirements for Each Category of Refund Applicants</T3>_(1)<T3>Refund Applications of End-Users.</T3> We proposed to adopt a findingthat end-users or ultimate consumers whose businesses are unrelated tothe petroleum industry were injured by the alleged overcharges settledin the Consent Order. Unlike regulated firms in the petroleum industry,end-users generally were not subject to price controls during the consentorder period. Moreover, they were not required to keep records that justifiedselling price increases by reference to cost increases. For these reasons,an analysis of the impact of alleged overcharges on the final prices ofnon-petroleum goods and services would be beyond the scope of a specialrefund proceedings. <T3>Texas Oil and Gas Corp.,</T3> 12 DOE andpara; 85,069 at 88,209 (1984).Therefore, we propose that end-users of petroleum products need only establishthat they were ultimate consumers of a specific volume of petroleum productsto qualify for a refund of their full allocable share. (2) <T3>Refund Applications of Cooperatives and Regulated Firms.</T3> We alsopropose that firms whose price for goods and services are regulated bya government agency or by the terms of a cooperative agreement will notbe required to demonstrate injury as a result of alleged crude oil overcharges.Although such firms, <T3>e.g.,</T3> public utilities that used petroleum products as feedstocksand agricultural cooperatives, generally would have passed any overchargesthrough to their customers, they generally would pass through any refundsas well. Therefore, we will require such applicants to certify that theywill pass any refund received through to their customers and to provideus with a detailed explanation of how they plan to accomplish this restitution.We will also require them to explain how they will notify the appropriateregulatory body or membership group of their receipt of the refund money.<T3>See Office of Special Counsel,</T3> 9 DOE andpara; 82,538 at 85,203 (1982).However, utility claimants whose claims are based on 5,000,000 gallonsor less will <T3>not</T3> be required to certify that they will pass the refunds throughto their customers. We further note that a cooperative's sales of petroleumproducts to non-members will be treated in the same manner as sales byother resellers. Cooperatives should therefore provide the DOE with a breakdownof their sales volumes to members and non-members. (3) <T3>Refund Applications of Resellers, Retailers and Refiners.</T3> We proposeto adopt a presumption that resellers, retailers and refiners were generallyable to pass any crude oil overcharges through to their customers. In orderto qualify for a refund, resellers, retailers and refiners must thereforeshow that they were unable to pass through the effects of crude oil overchargesto their own customers. It will be extremely difficult for resellers andretailers to make such a showing. The Entitlements program spread crudeoil overcharges evenly throughout the industry. Because crude oil overchargesequally affected <T3>all</T3> resellers and retailers (<T3>i.e.</T3>, the reseller and retailer applicants and their competitors),regardless of supplier, we believe that resellers' and retailers' sellingprices generally increased to the same degree. <T3>See A. Tarricone, Inc.</T3>, 15 DOE andpara; 85,495 to 88,896 (1987)(<T3>Tarricone</T3>). It would be unreasonable to presume, therefore, thatany reseller or retailer applicants in Subpart V crude oil refund proceedingswere adversely affected or competitively injured by crude oil overcharges.Instead, we require a detailed demonstration that a reseller or retailerwas unable to pass through the effects of crude oil overcharges to itscustomers. For example, a gasoline station would need to show that theminute fraction of a cent per gallon crude oil overcharge was absorbedby it rather than passed through to its customers as a result to overallhigher prices in the gasoline market in its area. (B) <T3>General Refund Application Requirements.</T3> In addition to the specificrequirements outlined above, all Applications for Refund must be in writingand must be signed by the applicant. The OHA has issued a number of Decisionsand Orders explaining crude oil refund procedures. Two Decisions describingcrude oil refund procedures in detail are <T3>Ernest Allerkamp</T3>, 17 DOE andpara; 85,079 (1988), and <T3>Tarricone,</T3> 15 DOE andpara; 85,495 (1987). Individuals who <T3>have</T3> already filed a crude oil refund application will <T3>not</T3> be required to submit another application in order to be consideredfor a share of the money paid to the DOE by Lone Star. It is therefore ordered that the refund amount remitted to the Departmentof Energy by Lone Star Oil and Chemical Company pursuant to the ConsentOrder executed on April 18, 1987 will be distributed in accordance withthe foregoing Decision. <ITAG tagnum="40">[FR Doc. 88-26952 Filed 11-21-88; 8:45 am] </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 6450-01-M</ITAG></ITAG></ITAG></TEXT></DOC>
