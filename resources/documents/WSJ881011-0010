The union has been negotiating jointly with representatives of Lucky and Safeway Stores Inc. for a new contract for the 1,200 Lucky and 1,000 Safeway Teamsters who work for those companies in northern California. The current contract expired April 30. A contract settlement negotiated by union and industry representatives was rejected Sunday night by union members.    A union spokesman said the members objected, among other things, to an &quot;economic parity clause&quot; in the proposed contract that would have allowed the companies in two years to implement a contract similar to that of their competition. &quot;Were that put into effect today, we would be looking at an immediate $2 per hour wage reduction, the loss of three holidays, loss of seven days sick leave, and the loss of one to two weeks vacation time,&quot; the spokesman said.    About 600 workers are on strike at Lucky's distribution center in Vacaville, Calif.; about 300 at the facility in San Leandro, Calif.; and about 50 at the Sacramento, Calif., facility. In addition, the Teamsters are picketing Lucky supermarkets in northern California. Lucky, based in Dublin, Calif., was acquired earlier this year by Irvine, Calif.-based American Stores Inc. for $2.51 billion, but a federal court has blocked American's merger of its Alpha Beta supermarkets with Lucky's operations on antitrust grounds.    The Teamsters haven't gone on strike against closely held Safeway, Oakland, Calif., but the Food Employers Council, which is representing both Lucky and Safeway, has said Safeway may lock out Teamsters workers at its northern California distribution centers in Richmond, Calif., and Fremont, Calif. Spokespersons for Lucky and Safeway referred all requests for comment to the Food Employers Council.    There are 162 Lucky stores and 242 Safeway stores in northern California affected by the negotiations, the Food Employers Council said. Distribution centers are being kept open with managers and temporary replacements, the council said. </TEXT></DOC>
