The alliance between two neighboring biotechnologycompanies, headquartered virtually next door to each other inindustrial Emeryville, Calif., surprised Wall Street analystswho had been expecting Cetus to be rescued by an older andmore-established drug company with deeper pockets and,perhaps, a higher bid in mind.</LP><TEXT>   Cetus also announced that it was selling all rights to itsGeneAmp polymerase chain reaction technology for $300 millionplus royalties to units of Roche Holding Ltd. of Basel,Switzerland. Roche, formerly a licensee of Cetus, will becomeoutright owner of the Cetus technology for finding andidentifying the genetic fingerprints of almost any livingthing, from disease microbes to criminal suspects.   The proposed acquisition of Cetus will yield littlepremium for shareholders, analysts said. Management of bothcompanies billed the deal as a marriage of synergisticscience, with Chiron contributing expertise in infectiousdisease diagnosis and Cetus in cancer research. Thetransaction would blend their work forces and plants into amajor facility with 1,400 people world-wide and 650,000square feet on neighboring sites in Emeryville, locatedacross the bay from San Francisco.   Under terms of the pact, Chiron said it will exchange 0.3share of newly issued common for each share of Cetus common.It will also assume $145 million of Cetus debt. Thetransaction, unanimously endorsed by both companies' boards,must still be approved by shareholders and regulatoryofficials. The surviving company will be called Chiron Corp.,led by Chiron's current top management, with a Cetussubsidiary and the Cetus name on the company's $45million-a-year generic chemotherapy business.   The deal would bring Chiron the big manufacturingcapability of Cetus, plus Cetus's established U.S. andEuropean sales forces. For Chiron the deal represents thepurchase of &quot;a relatively inexpensive asset,&quot; said RobertKupor of Kidder Peabody in New York.   &quot;This gives them critical mass and manpower long-term,&quot; headded, &quot;But investors are going to have to accept lowerearnings for the {near} future.&quot; Chiron, which has beenprofitable for the past five quarters, concedes it will havelosses through 1992 but hopes to be back in the black in1993. For 1990, Chiron posted profit of $6.8 million, or 24cents a share, on revenue of $78.5 million. Cetus reported aloss of $61.5 million, or $2.15 a share, on revenue of $60.4million for its fiscal year ended June 30, 1990, and wasforecasting a continued stream of red ink until it won marketapproval of its first biotech product for cancer,interleukin-2, called IL-2.   Both companies' shares were hammered yesterday. Innational over-the-counter trading, Chiron shares fell $6apiece to $54.75, while Cetus's fell $2.25 to $15.625. Thetumble followed a recent run-up in Cetus stock on rumors itwas being courted by potential buyers.   Since regulators rebuffed IL-2 last year, Cetus hasendured losses, a management shakeup and personnel cuts.Cetus made no secret of the fact it was trying to attract amerger partner, but most analysts didn't foresee it strikinga deal with a young and agile biotechnology company ofsimilar size and complementary product portfolio.   For its part, Cetus &quot;gets to stop worrying about what itis going to do,&quot; says James McCamant, editor of the MedicalTechnology Stock Letter. Cetus had made a heavy investmentanticipating speedy approval of IL-2 by the Food and DrugAdministration last summer, but the agency sent the companyback for more data on the drug's use in advanced kidneycancer. Chiron said IL-2 may come up for a rehearing by theFDA later this year.   Chiron said its advisers had been considering theacquisition with increasing excitement for the past ninemonths, but conceded that, for investors, the logic of thedeal might be &quot;an acquired taste.&quot;   Cetus President Hollings Renton, who will head thecombined entity's Cetus unit, conceded that there's &quot;nopremium&quot; to the stockholders, and that there will beshort-term pressure on the stock price, but he added that thedeal is &quot;fair to both sets of shareholders, and the premiumis what we will do together.&quot;   Chiron, founded in 1981, is best known for its creation ofa gene-spliced vaccine for Hepatitis B and its discovery ofthe Hepatitis C virus, a discovery it parlayed into ablood-screening test under its joint business with the Orthounit of Johnson andamp; Johnson. It also has major programs on anAIDS vaccine, growth factors and their receptors.   Cetus, founded in 1971, has concentrated much of itsresearch on cancer, including research into oncogenes andagents that signal cell growth, such as lymphokines, a classof compounds that includes IL-2. Initially IL-2 is beingtargeted as a product for advanced kidney cancer, but it isbeing tested for other illnesses, including AIDS. Cetus alsois developing the growth factor M-CSF, plus a library ofmonoclonal antibodies.   Mr. Kupor, the Kidder Peabody analyst, said the GeneAmprights sold to Roche were the &quot;family jewels&quot; of Cetus. ButEdward Penhoet, Chiron's president, said, &quot;I think the realfamily jewels at Cetus are its franchise in its established{cancer chemotherapy} products business.&quot;   The acquisition of the polymerase chain reactiontechnology &quot;will thrust us into a leadership position,&quot; inthe diagnostics field, said Thomas McMahon, president ofRoche's U.S. diagnostics business.   Formerly, Roche paid a royalty to Cetus estimated by Mr.Kupor at 8%. Under terms of the sale pact, the agreement iscut to a sliding royalty of 1% to 5% based on sales volume.But as a practical matter, Cetus already had spun off mostpractical rights to the technology. Chiron has a majordiagnostics program based on a technology called DNA probes.   ---   Mike Waldholz in New York contributed to this article.</TEXT></DOC>
