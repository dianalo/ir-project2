A spokesman for Tricentrol said the company agreed to the offer at a meeting yesterday in New York.    The bid, at 200 pence ($3.54) a share, topped an earlier offer of 160 pence by Societe Nationale Elf Aquitaine, a French state-controlled energy concern.    The acquisition, which had been expected, promises to provide Arco, the seventh-largest oil company in the U.S., with important British North Sea natural-gas reserves and an interest in a large oil field in southern England.    Under British rules, the tender offer will be open for a minimum of 21 days. Arco, however, continued to acquire shares on the open market and had by yesterday boosted its stake in Tricentrol to about 47% of the 93.4 million common shares oustanding, an Arco adviser said.    Tricentrol's shares rose 6.5 pence, to 197 pence, on London's stock exchange yesterday. Arco's stock closed with a gain of $1.25, at $75.625, in New York Stock Exchange consolidated trading.    Arco's accumulation of a near-majority stake in Tricentrol is expected to forestall a further offer by Elf Aquitaine. In Paris, a spokeswoman for the French company declined to comment. At last report, Elf Aquitaine held an 8.03% stake.    Tricentrol had proven and probable oil reserves totaling 72.9 million barrels, and natural-gas reserves totaling 587 billion cubic feet, as of Dec. 31, 1986, the latest date for which statistics are available.    Included in those totals is the company's 17.5% interest in the Wytch Farm field in southern England -- the largest onshore oil field in Europe -- which recent drilling has suggested may be far larger than earlier supposed.    While relatively rich in reserves, Tricentrol has spurted red ink in recent quarters, posting a loss of #3.7 million for the nine months ended Sept. 30 and a loss of #61.2 million for all of 1986, reflecting substantial restructuring charges. Results for all of 1987 aren't yet available, but the seriousness of the company's financial plight showed up in a year-end deficit of about #40 million in its reserves account, a measure of shareholder equity.    Cash-rich Arco is well suited as a buyer that can finance exploration and development of Tricentrol's prospects, analysts said. Tricentrol said yesterday it was canceling plans for refinancing.    The American company wants to boost substantially its foreign oil and gas reserves and is expected to offset future earnings from Tricentrol with exploration outlays in the United Kingdom -- a financial advantage that may have helped Arco agree to a price that was more than double the 99 pence at which Tricentrol was trading last December, shortly before Elf Aquitaine's opening bid.    Arco recently said it had a gain of about #134 million from the sale of its 24% stake in Britoil PLC. Arco last month lost a bidding battle for Britoil -- a much larger company than Tricentrol -- to British Petroleum Co.    The company, founded in 1917 as the Trinidad Central Oil Co., took its current name from the original company's telex address. Like Tricentrol itself many years later, the original company's holdings in Trinidad were sold to a major oil company.    ---   Paul Hemp in London and Lorie Teeter in Paris contributed to this article. </TEXT></DOC>
