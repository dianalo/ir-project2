Recent, large-scaleprograms to collect empirical energy consumption data, however, providea basis for alternative ways to estimate program effects that utilizethe empirical data. The PRISM methodology uses relatively inexpensivebilling and weather data to estimate base and temperature-sensitive (primarilyspace-heating) loads. We used billing data from over 300 manufactured(mobile) homes in two residential conservation projects to derive PRISMheating energy estimates. Actual heating energy data for a subset ofthese homes was used to develop a methodology for adjusting the initialPRISM-based heating estimates. We developed the adjustment relying ona theoretical approach and the empirical data. This approach resultedin a correction technique that reduced the average error in the initialPRISM-based space-heating estimates by about 70%, and requires primarilyreadily available PRISM outputs and limited housing characteristics data.9 refs., 1 fig., 4 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
