Garcia</HL><DD> 12/29/86</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> STOCK MARKET, OFFERINGS (STK)STOCK INDEXES (NDX) </IN><TEXT>   Investors who were keen on small emerging-growth stocks this year probably aren't finding as much cheer in their portfolios this holiday season as they'd planned on.    As the Standard andamp; Poor's 500-stock index was gaining 20% through June 30, the Morgan Stanley index of 100 small emerging-growth stocks rose about 30%. However, the Morgan index nose-dived 17% in the third quarter, while the Sandamp;P 500 index lost just 9%. July and September were the worst months for the little stocks. So far in the fourth quarter, these issues have been slightly outperforming blue-chip stocks.    After such a harrowing 1986, some money managers now see some compelling values in the emerging-growth sector of the market. Using history as a guide, the bulls say these stocks are now poised for a rocket-powered advance that could last several years.    One thing that keeps great masses of investors away from the growth stocks is their inherent volatility. &quot;Whenever there's a downdraft in the market, these (smaller) stocks are hit worse&quot; than the broader blue-chip market, says Dennis Sherva, a managing director at Morgan Stanley who heads up research in emerging stocks. Yet, while the investment risks are greater, so, usually, are the rewards, he adds.    The wider swings are possible because many of these stocks don't have large numbers of shares outstanding and aren't actively traded. Consequently, it doesn't take much buying or selling to drive their prices up or down.    In addition, smaller growth stocks have been out of sync with several recent trends in the stock market, says Timothy Ebright, one of the portfolio managers for T. Rowe Price's New Horizons Fund -- the granddad of growth funds.    He notes that this year many issues in the general market were driven by mergers and acquisitions or just takeover speculation, but that this activity mostly involved large-capitalization stocks. And while the decline in the dollar benefited the multinationals, many of the smaller companies have only domestic operations and were left out. Further, many investors this year were attracted to companies paying high dividends. But mostly these were the larger, more mature firms and not the young little companies that typically need to reinvest all the capital they can raise to finance rapid growth.    The sluggish economy in the past two years also has hurt small technology stocks, which are heavily represented in the emerging-growth stock sector. Except for computer software concerns, many small technology companies have been hurt by stingy capital spending and increased competition during this period, analysts say.    However, all that suggests there is a silver lining. Many of these stocks are just plain cheap right now. In comparing the price/earnings ratio of the big-capitalization to the smaller-capitalization stocks, the New Horizons Fund is now roughly equal to the companies in the Sandamp;P 500-stock index based on estimated earnings for the next 12 months. In the past smaller growth stocks have sold for as much as two times the P/E of the Sandamp;P 500.    Mr. Ebright says when the relative P/E for the New Horizons Fund has dropped to 1.1 times or lower, the stage has been set for some powerful rallies. After hitting that level in March 1977, the fund racked up a gain of 79% in the next three years and 153.5% in five years.    Mr. Sherva expects the smaller emerging-growth stocks to outperform the broad market in 1987 and 1988. He's sticking to consumer-oriented and service growth companies, while underplaying issues heavily dependent on the economy for growth.    Mr. Ebright says the performance of the New Horizons Fund was hurt this year because a major portion of its assets, close to 30%, was invested in technology stocks that lagged behind the rest of the market. Meanwhile, relatively little was invested in financial stocks, which did perform well.    For 1987, the folks at T. Rowe Price don't plan to chase the last few points in the financial stocks rally and will stick with technology. &quot;Why bail out when we think these stocks are most attractive?&quot; Mr. Ebright says.    ---   Friday's Market Activity   The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 3.52 points to close at 1930.40 on post-holiday volume of 48.9 million shares, down from 95.4 million Christmas Eve and the lowest daily total in two years.    Advancing issues outpaced decliners 794-575 on the New York Stock Exchange; 530 stocks were unchanged.    In the four-day trading week, the industrial average gained 1.55 points, the Dow Jones Transportation Average lost 16.12, or nearly 2%, and the Dow Jones Utility Average fell 2.59, or 1.2%.    Merck continued to lead blue-chip issues Friday, rising 5 3/4 to 129 on 469,700 shares. The stock also showed strength earlier in the week, partly on investor optimism over a new cholesterol drug that some analysts said could become a major seller in a few years. An article in Tuesday's Wall Street Journal described the drug and the company's financial and marketing strength in the industry.    Some traders also attributed the buying, which carried into other drug issues, to money managers who want to show a strong holding of those issues in their portfolios at year's end.    SmithKline Beckman rose 2 1/8 to 94, Bristol-Myers gained 2 to 85, Warner-Lambert rose 1 3/4 to 60 1/8, Squibb gained 1 1/4 to 118 1/4, Pfizer rose 2 to 62 7/8, and American Home Products rose 5/8 to 78 1/8.    Among the blue chips, International Business Machines was unchanged at 122, General Motors rose 1/8 to 67 1/8, Eastman Kodak lost 1/2 to 69 1/4, United Technologies eased 1/8 to 47 1/8, and American Express rose 1/4 to 58 5/8.    Retailing issues were generally lower. F.W. Woolworth slipped 1/2 to 37 7/8, J.C. Penney eased 1/8 to 74 1/4, Federated Department Stores fell 7/8 to 85 1/4, May Department Stores eased 3/8 to 35 5/8, and American Stores dropped 7/8 to 55 1/4. </TEXT></DOC>
