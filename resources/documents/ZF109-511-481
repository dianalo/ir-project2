 Companies also have to justify costs morestrictly today than in the past because the economy is slowingdown.andP;  Some applications, such as Windows 3.0, demand upgradingbecause they are dramatically different from previous products,but automatic across-the-board upgrades to every new softwarerelease are becoming less and less common in today'sorganizations.andM;</SUMMARY><DESCRIPT>Topic:     MicrocomputersSoftware packagesUpgradingEnhancementsSoftware SelectionManagement of EDP.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>The natives are getting awfully restless.andP;  I'm talking about the phenomenallevel of resistance among corporate computing managers to software upgrades.andO;What seemed six months ago a passing phase has turned into iron-willedstubbornness.andM;PC coordinators put forth three strong arguments to explain why they're notsnapping up the latest round of software upgrades.andP;  This is important, so Iwant you to hear them speak in their own words.andM;First, they're swamped with other decisions and other work right now.andP;  TheWindows decision is one example.andP;  But networking decisions, processordecisions, security and other issues are crowding their plates.andP;  Softwareupgrades can wait.andM;&quot;Upgrading to a new release of something a user already has and works fine isgoing to make a lot less difference to him than a half-dozen other thingswe're working on,&quot; a micro manager told me.andM;&quot;We can do only so much.andP;  Our priorities for this year don't include spendinga lot of time and money on upgrading.&quot;andM;Second, the level of functionality in existing releases of mainstream PCapplications is so high that managers are skeptical that the marginalimprovements in new releases are worth the effort.andM;&quot;My users are swamped with features they don't need and don't use,&quot; a micromanager in Florida told me last week.andP;  &quot;Why should I put us through thatagain, when hardly anyone here has reached the limits of what they've gotnow?&quot;andM;Third, the level of pain in committing to yet another upgrade is so greatthat many see it as still not worth the trouble despite larger improvementsthis year than the modest increases in functionality of many 1989 upgrades.andM;&quot;As the number of PC users grows arithmetically,&quot; an info-center manager saidin a Q andamp; A session after a speech last month, &quot;the cost and difficulty ofdistributing, installing and training for software upgrades increasesexponentially.andP;  We're just not gonna do it unless something really big comesalong.&quot;andM;From another: &quot;Our real cost of upgrades is about three to six times theper-user price we pay for the upgrade itself.andP;  It's hard for me to figurewhat a vendor could add to some of the packages we use to justify us spending$100 to $500 a user for across-the-board upgrades.&quot;andM;There are other reasons: A slowing economy makes PC managers think twiceabout spending money on upgrades, and some are reluctant to buy new versionsof character-based programs when they think they may be recommending a moveto a graphical interface in a year or two.andM;But those Big Three arguments5/8the logic of which is cumulative5/8havedominated the discussions I've had with PC managers this year on upgrading.andM;Certainly there are some exceptions.andP;  Windows apps, for example: If you go toWindows, you buy Windows apps.andM;Borland's Quattro Pro 2.0 has stirred up a lot of interest, as has Paradox3.5 (perhaps in part because both offer really substantial improvements).andO;And Lotus'andM;1-2-3 release 3.1 has, too (probably because it's a good interim answer forcompanies torn between the character-based world and a Windows-drivengraphical interface world).andM;But the day of the automatic no-brainer decision to upgrade to each newrelease of software is over.andP;  As is the day of a presumed imperative to haveall your users on the same release-level of major applications packages.andO;Increasingly, PC managers tell me they're perfectly happy to support usercommunities segmented into two or more releases of major apps.andP;  From theFlorida micro manager again: &quot;It's just not that hard to support more thanone release.andM;&quot;So why move people up if they don't need it?andP;  If my help desk finds someoneneeds a later release, because he needs some feature that isn't in theversion he's using, then fine.andP;  We'll bring him the new one right then, andput it on his PC.andM;&quot;That makes a lot more sense than automatically spending hundreds of dollarsper user for something they don't need.&quot;andM;Strong words.andP;  And hard to argue with.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
