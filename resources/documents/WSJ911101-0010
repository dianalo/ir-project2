Yet he complains that Mr. Bush has &quot;letthe home front go by the wayside.&quot;   So many unaddressed, long-term economic problems arepiling up that he worries what awaits his college-studentson. &quot;His future for a job is less than mine was,&quot; Mr. Warrensays, &quot;and I had no college education.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   Kathleen Patti, a 42-year-old Republican, picture-framerand artist, keeps hearing that things in the country aregetting better. She is having none of it: &quot;I heard yesterdaythat we're slowly moving out of the recession. It doesn'tseem like it from my point of view.&quot;   Mr. Warren and Ms. Patti aren't alone in their concerns. Ayear before the 1992 elections, a new Wall Street Journal/NBCNews poll finds voters across the country deeply disturbed bythe country's course, and worried that no political leaders-- not George Bush, and not the Democrats -- are addressingthe issues that matter to them. It is a crisis of confidencethat is fueled by, but not limited to, the economic malaise.   The survey, which was conducted by Peter Hart, a Democrat,and Robert Teeter, a Republican who also polls for PresidentBush, suggests that while Mr. Bush enters the electioncampaign in a politically commanding position, he is far frominvincible.   &quot;What's happened is that the mood has turned markedlynegative in 1991,&quot; pollsters Hart and Teeter conclude. &quot;Ifthat continues, it could spell problems next year both forBush and for individual members of Congress -- though theyhaven't surfaced yet for either.&quot;   The pollsters identify two major potential vulnerabilitiesfor Mr. Bush -- the public perceptions that he has nodomestic agenda and that his economic policies favor thewealthy. In the survey, 55% say the phrase &quot;has policies thatfavor the wealthy&quot; well describes the president, while only20% disagree.   The question is whether his personal popularity is strongenough to withstand those concerns -- or whether theyeventually begin to pull him down if the economy stays sour.   Voters in the poll, a special survey on politicalattitudes, broadly approve of Mr. Bush's overall jobperformance by 63% to 30%. But at the same time, 61%disapprove of his handling of the economy, a jump of 10percentage points since a September Journal/NBC poll and theworst showing of his presidency. Fifty-seven percent thinkthe nation is on the wrong track -- equaling the mostpessimistic that voters have been since Mr. Bush took office.And by 53% to 42%, voters believe America is in &quot;a state ofdecline&quot; -- a sharp reversal from the results of a similarquestion asked a year ago.   Yet the public doesn't know enough about the Democraticcandidates to see any of them as a credible alternative: Headto head, Mr. Bush clobbers all of the Democratic candidatesor would-be candidates, with New York Gov. Mario Cuomo -- whohasn't yet decided whether to run -- faring the best.   To further explore voter attitudes on the eve of thecampaign, The Wall Street Journal asked pollster Hart tobring together a group of Kalamazoo voters earlier this weekto discuss their feelings about the way things are going inthe country. The group, including Mr. Warren, Ms. Patti and adozen of their neighbors, was too small to be a scientificsample. But the views expressed help explain and illuminatethe attitudes that lay behind the stark numbers of thenationwide poll.   Unlike other Michigan cities like Flint, Kalamazoo ishardly economically devastated. Home to Upjohn Co., WesternMichigan University and a big General Motors stamping plant,Kalamazoo has an unemployment rate near the national average-- which makes it one of the lowest in the state.   Yet these middle Americans see the nation going downhill,with a president who is unwilling, and a Congress that isunable, to take bold action to halt the slide.   What clearly emerges both from these Kalamazoo residentsand the nationwide poll is that Mr. Bush could be beaten by acandidate who taps into growing middleclass resentments overeconomics, health care and general alienation from thepolitical system. But there is no obvious vehicle for suchdisaffection; both in the poll and discussion group, peopledon't have high regard for the Democratic Party.   Mr. Bush is at risk, clearly, but there also is palpableanger at Congress -- a disapproval margin in the Journal/NBCpoll of more than 2 to 1 -- suggesting that many members ofthe majority Democrats could face tougher struggles in 1992than they have had in years.   It is nothing new that Congress is held in low esteem. Butone difference this time, pollsters Hart and Teeter note, isthat voters have a specific &quot;bill of particulars&quot; againstlawmakers. These are such perceived offenses as voting forcongressional pay raises, mishandling the allegations againstSupreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas and bouncing checks atthe House bank -- which is something that 64% of voters saythat would make them &quot;much less likely&quot; to vote for theoffender.   For all the voters' disgust with the institution ofCongress, though, they continue for now to rate their ownrepresentative highly, regarding him or her as the exceptionto the rule. Here in Kalamazoo, that translates into highmarks for the local congressman, Howard Wolpe, a seven-termveteran who is just the sort of Democrat who might be introuble if there were a sudden tidal wave of anti-incumbentsentiment.   In discussing the presidency, it is clear the folks in thefocus group here aren't mad at George Bush: They by and largelike him personally and respect him as a strong leader onforeign policy. &quot;He is a lot tougher than I thought he was,&quot;says Micheal Clark, 36, a Republican janitor.   Their plea is simply that he begin to exercise some ofthat strong leadership to address what they see as cryingneeds here at home -- the loss of jobs to overseascompetitors, the cost and quality of health care -- ratherthan spending so much time tending to foreign affairs.   Mr. Bush thinks foreign policy is &quot;more important rightnow&quot; but he is wrong, says 20-year-old Jill Devereux, acollege student and political independent. The presidentneeds to &quot;address more domestic problems and issues overhere,&quot; she says. &quot;They're more important right now thananything over there . . . he gets into too many foreignproblems we don't need to be in.&quot;   Michelle Bauman, a 32-year-old schoolteacher, is aRepublican who voted for Mr. Bush in '88 and probably will doso again in '92. Yet she hopes Gov. Cuomo runs against him.Her logic: &quot;Bush would have to dig into some deeper things,and know he had to hit home with people to win.&quot;   Congress, meanwhile, is seen as every bit as out of touchas Mr. Bush -- and a lot less likable. &quot;They're stuck in theold mud,&quot; says Democrat Peter Bis, a 40-year-old former ownerof an auto paint shop who now is unemployed. &quot;They've got somuch to cover up, going on with their own stuff, that theydon't have any touch with what's really going on.&quot;   One obvious answer, the people in this group say, is termlimits. &quot;When you have rotten teachers and they get tenure,you go through all kinds of trouble to get rid of thatteacher,&quot; says Ms. Bauman. &quot;And then we do that with ourpoliticians.&quot;   Yet most of these voters are quick to exempt Rep. Wolpefrom the general scorn reserved for lawmakers. Mr. Wolpe,they insist, is different. Ms. Patti, the Republican artist,is one believer, ever since Mr. Wolpe helped her iron out aproblem with her state taxes. &quot;I called him, and he helpedimmediately,&quot; she says -- despite the fact that as acongressman he has nothing to do with state taxes.   What are the broader issues these folks wish Washingtonwould focus on? Jobs and long-term economic health, to start.&quot;The job market is just not here any more,&quot; says Mr. Warren,complaining that the U.S. is increasingly losing jobs abroad.Richard Emmons, 39, a Democrat, says, &quot;I sell products thatare related to construction and industry, and theopportunities to sell are just not there.&quot;   Health care ranks high, too. &quot;My father was dying, and twodays before he died they were trying to kick him out of thehospital,&quot; says John Whitman, 38, a food-service worker andDemocrat. &quot;They've just got it so screwed up right now.&quot;Franklin Clipper, 55, a design engineer and Bush Republican,says, &quot;I have good health insurance. But my children, boy,they're in trouble all the time.&quot;   Adds Ms. Patti, who is self-employed: &quot;When somebody getssick, it's a catastrophe . . . I have to worry, am I going tolose my home because my child got sick and is in thehospital?&quot;   Economic and domestic concerns dominate the nationwideJournal/NBC poll. The survey found that more people cited theeconomy as the nation's No. 1 problem than any other issue;more specifically, unemployment is the No. 1 economicproblem, cited by 39% of respondents.   The poll also found 41% of voters say a president's mostimportant job is handling domestic issues and 35% say dealingwith the economy; only 12% say national security and foreignpolicy top the list. But economics and domestic issues arevoters' biggest complaints about President Bush. A plurality,33%, say the criticism that Mr. Bush's policies favor thewealthy over the average person is one of the major reasonsthey might not support him. Almost as many, 32%, cite theamount of time he spends on foreign policy.   In a series of questions asking people to rate Mr. Bush ona variety of traits, the poll paints a portrait of him as apresident who is seen as effective, honest, down-to-earth andwilling to take unpopular stands. But he is also seen as notparticularly interested in fighting for the average personand favoring the rich.   The image of coziness with the wealthy has clearly spilledover to affect Mr. Bush's party as well. In the poll, 64% seeRepublicans as the party &quot;looking out for the wealthy.&quot; Bycontrast, the Democrats enjoy an edge of 33% to 24% as theparty that is better at &quot;looking out for people like you.&quot;   Democrats are also seen as the party better able to dealwith issues of the elderly, education, environment, healthand abortion. The two parties are evenly split on thequestion of handling the economy, the Republicans having lostthe substantial edge they held on the issue two years ago.But the GOP is still seen as the party best able to keepworld peace, protect America's interests on trade, and reducethe drug problem.   And voters have a more favorable opinion of the GOPoverall, viewing it positively by a margin of 44% to 31%,while the Democrats are viewed favorably by a narrow 37% to34% margin.   Both the poll and focus group suggest a widespreadignorance among voters at this early stage about theDemocratic presidential contenders. Of the six majorannounced candidates, the front-runner, former CaliforniaGov. Edmund G. Brown Jr., probably owes his position more toname recognition than anything else: He is the only one thatmore than a third of the voters know anything about. (Andwhat many of those voters know, they don't like: 28% view Mr.Brown unfavorably, while just 17% have a positive view ofhim.)   The strongest Democratic candidate remains the one whoisn't in the field: Gov. Cuomo. If he jumps into the race, hebecomes the immediate front-runner, with 31% of the vote; Mr.Brown's 21% in a Cuomo-less field immediately shrinks to 13%,and everyone else is in single digits.   The general lack of knowledge of the Democratic field isechoed in the Michigan discussion group. Most of these peoplearen't scornful of the Democratic candidates; they simplyknow nothing about them at this stage of the game.   Dawne Washburn, 43, a Republican accountant, lists her twomajor concerns as education and the rising cost of healthcare, and says it isn't impossible that she would voteDemocratic next year. But if the Democrats &quot;put up anotherDukakis or something, I am sure I would vote for George Bushagain.&quot;   And Mr. Warren, the Bush-voting Democrat, thinks that maybe exactly what happens. &quot;By the time the Democratichierarchy gets done with them,&quot; he says of the presidentialcandidates, &quot;the ones that you feel that you want in therewill be put aside. And they'll have somebody in there thatgoes the route of the Democratic Party.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
