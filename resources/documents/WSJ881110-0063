Prices of some actively traded 30-year government bonds fell about 5/8 of a point, or $6.25 for each $1,000 face amount. That brought the yield on benchmark long-term issues to 9% from 8.94% Tuesday. Corporate and municipal bonds also slipped in subdued trading, while foreign bond prices were mixed.    Despite the declines, traders reported significant demand for $9.59 billion of 10-year notes auctioned by the Treasury yesterday at an 8.94% average yield. Recent higher yields apparently were sufficient to bring significant purchases by Japanese investors, traders said.    &quot;The back-up in rates brought buyers into the market,&quot; said Paul W. Mozer, a managing director at Salomon Brothers Inc., who predicted the average yield on the notes hours before the results were disclosed. &quot;There was decent interest around the world for the 10-year notes,&quot; he added.    Nonetheless, the outlook for the bond market remains troubled, according to several analysts. Both bonds and the dollar skidded after Martin Feldstein, president and chief executive of the Bureau of Economic Research and an adviser to Mr. Bush's presidential campaign, said the dollar needs to fall 10% to 20% in the next three years if the U.S. is to redress its trade imbalance and keep the economic recovery going.    Mr. Feldstein told a meeting of the American Stock Exchange that the dollar would need to get down to levels of 100 yen or slightly more, and 1.45 marks at the lowest, to achieve these reductions.    While they hardly represented a departure from his previous position on the dollar, Mr. Feldstein's comments apparently unsettled traders and investors on the heels of Mr. Bush's election. &quot;The bond market was sabotaged by Feldstein and now it's testing Bush's leadership,&quot; said Lawrence A. Kudlow, chief economist at Bear, Stearns andamp; Co. Mr. Bush &quot;must issue a clear statement underscoring the new administration's commitment to a steady and reliable dollar. Until it's made there's a substantial risk the bond market could get much worse.&quot;    Other analysts said Mr. Bush might not even get the benefit of a honeymoon in the credit markets. &quot;Both the outlook for the budget deficit and inflation is deteriorating,&quot; said Lacy H. Hunt, chief economist at CMandamp;M Group. &quot;The election, rather than resolve things, made solutions more difficult because Mr. Bush faces a bigger and potentially more hostile Democratic Congress. I think the dollar is going to fall to a new low,&quot; dragging bond prices down in the process, Mr. Hunt said.    Robert Stovall, president of Stovall/21st Advisers Inc., a money management concern, said Mr. Bush doesn't appear to be getting the benefit of previous Republican presidential victories. &quot;He's gotten a cold shower instead when you realize that nine out of the 12 Republican victories in this century were followed by bond market rallies,&quot; he said.    Despite the clear-cut Bush win, &quot;Our feeling is that the problems facing the incoming president are far greater than the issue of whether Bush or Dukakis was the choice,&quot; said Robert Manning, fixed-income director at Axe-Houghton Management in Tarrytown, N.Y.    Treasury Securities   Interest rates on short-term Treasury bills were little changed despite signs that the Federal Reserve slightly tightened credit, traders said. The rate on federal funds, or overnight reserves banks and other financial institutions lend each other overnight, &quot;is now hovering between 8 1/4% and 8 3/8%, up from a range of 8 1/8% to 8 1/4%,&quot; said Mr. Mozer of Salomon.    The rate on the latest three-month bills climbed to 7.58% bid from 7.57% Tuesday. The rate on new six-month bills rose to 7.76% bid from 7.74% bid.    The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bonds fell to 101 10/32 from 101 30/32. At the Treasury's auction of new 10-year notes, yields on accepted bids ranged from 8.93% to 8.94%, and 43% of the bids at the highest return, or stop-out rate, were accepted. The yield was down from 9.27% at the previous 10-year note auction Aug. 8. The average yield was the lowest since 8.21% on Feb. 3.    An index of long-term Treasury bonds compiled by Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. fell 6.34 points to 1246.80. It ranged between 1249.45 and 1243.19. The total return so far this year on the bonds in the index is 7.91%. That includes price changes as well as interest income.    Here are details of yesterday's note auction:   Rates are determined by the difference between the purchase price and face value. Thus, higher bidding narrows the investor's return while lower bidding widens it.                            10-Year    Applications ........................ $28,911,998,000    Accepted bids ........................ $9,592,791,000    Accepted at low price ........................... 43%    Accepted noncompetitively .............. $457,000,000    Average price (Rate) ................. 99.576 (8.94%)    High price (Rate) .................... 99.576 (8.94%)    Low price (Rate) ..................... 99.641 (8.93%)    Interest rate ................................ 8 7/8%   The notes are dated Nov. 15 and mature Nov. 15, 1998.   Corporate Issues   Prices finished the day 1/8 to 3/8 point lower in light trading.   On the high-yield front, Payless Cashways Inc.'s 335,000 debenture-stock warrant units were offered to investors through Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co.   Each unit consists of a $1,000 face amount senior subordinated debenture due Nov. 1, 2000, which carries a 14 1/2% coupon and one warrant to purchase four shares of the company's Class A common stock.   Payless Cashways was taken private in a $1.14 billion leveraged buy-out earlier this year. Goldman Sachs underwrote a portion of the bridge loan that helped finance the transaction and also owns 43.1% of the equity in the company.   Municipal Issues   Most municipal bonds ended with 1/4 to 3/8 point losses, having succumbed to the pressure of a softer dollar and easier Treasurys.   The trend was established at the onset of trading as the dollar tumbled in the wake of the U.S. national elections.   Market participants said that while a victory in the presidential race by Mr. Bush was at least partly discounted by the market going into the election, there was some disappointment over the Democrats' ability to increase their majorities in both houses of Congress.   New Jersey Turnpike Authority 7.20% bonds due 2018 ended off their session low but still half a point weaker at 94 3/4. The bonds yielded about 7.64%, four basis points above their yield at Tuesday's close.   In the new issue market, underwriters led by Kidder, Peabody andamp; Co. began offering $104 million of Hudson County, N.Y., correctional facility certificates of participation, sweetening yields from preliminary morning levels by as much as 10 basis points in the afternoon. Overall, reoffering yields ranged from 6.30% in 1992 to 7.62% in 2021 for the insured certificates.   Mortgage, Asset-Backed Issues   Ginnie Maes and other mortgage issues ended 2/32 to 8/32 lower after a quiet session in which investor attention was focused on the Treasury's auction of 10-year notes.   In the asset-backed market, Chrysler Financial Corp. made the second public offering of securities backed by loans on pleasure boats.   The two-part issue, totaling just over $208 million, was sold through Chemical Securities Inc. Asset-backed issues have appealed to investors because the securities have relatively short average lives and carry higher yields than top-grade corporate bonds.   In the mortgage sector, the scarcity of Fannie Mae 10% securities appears to be diminishing somewhat, although it's still proving costly for those who are short to cover their positions.   The securities were quoted at 101 for November delivery, down 1/8.   Among other mortgage issues, Ginnie Mae 9% securities were at 95 1/4, down 8/32; 9 1/2% securities at 98 2/32, down 6/32; and 10% securities at 100 26/32, down 2/32. The 9 1/2% bonds were yielding 9.91% to a 12-year average life assumption, as the spread above the 10-year Treasury note tightened three basis points to 99 basis points.   Foreign Bonds   Japanese and West German government bonds rose, while British government issues declined in subdued trading.   In Tokyo, a strengthening yen helped offset continued concern about the deteriorating health of Emperor Hirohito. His death could keep the financial markets closed for several days, traders said.   The government's benchmark No. 105 5% bonds due 1997 rose 0.20 percentage point to 102.30. The yield fell 0.03 point to 4.65%.   In this week's auction of 4.1% two-year government bonds, the average yield was 4.168%. The Ministry of Finance received 418.5 billion yen in bids, and accepted 221.7 billion yen.   West German government bonds and mark-denominated Eurobonds moved inversely following a news report that the accrued interest portion of the 10% government withholding tax would be delayed until 1992. Eurobonds fell about 1/4 point, while government issues rose 0.10 point.   The government's benchmark 6 3/4% bonds due August 1998 gained 0.10 point to 102.95 to yield 6.330%. Among benchmark Eurobonds, the World Bank 6% bonds due 1998 fell 0.35 point to 98.40 bid to yield 6.22%.   In London, British government bonds, or gilts, fell amid concern that Britian's short-term interest rates are sufficiently high to remove inflation pressures in the economy. The government's 11 3/4% bonds due 2003/2007 fell 9/32 to 116 3/4 to yield 9.56%.</TEXT></DOC>
