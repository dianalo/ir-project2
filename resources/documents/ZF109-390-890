 Prices range from aslittle as $35 (for one of Cortelco's Tel-Trex phones) to $588,000(for Octel's Aspen Maxum voice processing system).andM;</SUMMARY><DESCRIPT>Topic:     Customer Premises EquipmentCentrex Telephone ServiceDirectoriesTelecommunications.andO;Feature:   illustrationphotograph.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Active VoiceandM;The ever popular Repartee call-processing system from Active Voice  Seattle,WA) operates behind ATandamp;T 1AESS, 5AESS or Northern Telecom DMS 100 SMDIequipped CO switches.andP;  That's right, Virginia, it lets you integrate Centrexauto attendant, voice mail and voice response applications.andM;The Repartee's EasyMade Switch Setup lets you automatically transfer calls tothe correct voice mailbox.andP;  A message waiting light or stutter dialtoneindicates the presence of a message.andM;All call records are sent over a data link to the Repartee, providing thesystem with information on the number called, the type of call forwardingthat was used and the calling number if it is within the Centrex system.andM;A networking capability that complies with the AMIS (Audio MessageInterchange Standards) specifications enables Repartee systems to be linkedtogether, connecting offices in widely dispersed locations.andP;  The interfacealso lets Repartee integrate with other call-processing systems that offerAMIS networking.andM;Repartee is available in two to 36 port configurations.andP;  Prices range from$3,400 to $56,000.andM;AECandM;AEC's (Dublin, CA) Max Receptionist auto attendant/voice messaging system isnow available with an SMDI (Simplified Message Desk Interface) option.andP;  SMDIis provided on some Centrex systems served by 1AESS, 5ESS and DMS-100 COs.andM;The interface, which is in the form of a 1200 baud serial data link betweenthe CO and the Max, allows busy or no-answer calls to be routed directly to auser's voice mailbox and provides message-waiting indication.andM;The Max uses the available SMDI data to answer calls appropriately.andP;  Callsthat come in with SMDI information are answered with the personalizedgreetings of particular extensions.andP;  Callers can then leave messages, tryother extensions or be directed to an operator.andP;  Calls that are made directlyto the unit from a foreign exchange lack SMDI information, and thus receivethe generic company greeting.andM;For message-waiting indication,  the Max signals the CO to provide stutterdialtone on Centrex extensions.andP;  When all messages have been heard, the Maxagain signals for the stutter tone to be turned off.andM;Retail pricing for the Max Receptionist starts at $11,000 for a two-port, 3.5hour system.andP;  The SMDI interface is $1,250 per system.andM;AmtelcoandM;The PC-MX attendant console from Amtelco (McFarland, WI) integrates withCentrex to provide call processing and text messaging, among other things.andO;The most recent, new-and-improved version handles up to seven attendantpositions and accommodates up to 20 ports.andM;Capability for off-premise positions has also been added.andP;
