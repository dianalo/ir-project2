As a result, lawyers say, they are starting to advisecorporate clients that they should seek alternatives tolitigation, such as mediation or use of privately paidjudges, if they want even moderately fast results. Someclients in nonbusiness cases, which range from divorce todisputes between neighbors, are also being steered towardout-of-court alternatives.</LP><TEXT>   Courts have been a victim of the recent spate of battlesbetween governors and legislators over shrinking state funds.Larry L. Sipes, president of the National Center for StateCourts, a nonprofit organization dedicated to improving courtoperation, estimates that 60% of all state court systems arefacing a budgetary squeeze.   The impact could be enormous. Some 95% of all lawsuits arefiled in state courts, which typically receive less that 3%of their state's budgets. In the face of dwindling resources,court administrators are preparing for court closings andlayoffs. The backlog of civil cases, they predict, willburgeon.   The problem is compounded by spiraling criminal caseloads, particularly drug-related prosecutions. Defendants incriminal cases are guaranteed speedy justice by the U.S.Constitution and under the laws of many states. Therefore,the civil docket of state courts will bear the brunt of thebudget cuts.   &quot;Unfortunately, we are going to have to prioritize becauseof the very severe cutbacks,&quot; says Sol Wachtler, chief judgeof New York's courts, which face a shortfall of approximately$35 million. Criminal, family and housing courts will be thestate's priorities. &quot;Personnel {will} have to be drawn fromthe civil side,&quot; says Judge Wachtler. &quot;We're going to try tooperate the civil courts as sparsely as is humanly possibleso that we don't have to close them, but it would seem thatcertain closings will be inevitable.&quot;   The budget for Massachusetts' trial courts has droppedabout $20 million to about $230 million in the last twoyears, according to Henry L. Barr, administrator of courts.About 1,000 nonjudicial positions are being eliminated. Thecourts had set the goal of disposing of all civil suitswithin two years of filing, but Mr. Barr says that meetingthat goal will now prove impossible.   &quot;If you're a petitioner, you're going to feel somewhatfrustrated,&quot; he says. Massachusetts' chief justice of theSupreme Judicial Court, Paul J. Liacos, has suggested that ifbudgetary constraints worsen, jury trials in civil cases mayhave to be eliminated, according to Mr. Barr. Earlier thisyear, Vermont instituted a sixmonth ban on civil jury trialsto avoid a state deficit. Chief Justice Liacos could not bereached for comment.   Joseph T. McLaughlin, the head of the litigationdepartment at the New York law firm Shearman andamp; Sterling, saysthat civil court delays will lead more business clients toseek litigation alternatives, including arbitration andmediation.   He says he routinely advises clients involved in businesscases that commercial disputes will take three to five years,including appeals. &quot;We are raising with clients the prospectof taking a dispute which otherwise would have gone to courtto some sort of private dispute resolution,&quot; he says.   Marc S. Galanter, a professor of law at the University ofWisconsin, says that continued state court delays could&quot;accelerate the move to the privatization&quot; of the courts.&quot;One thing that we should worry about is that some groups ofusers who can afford it will go off to private courts andprivate judges and withdraw from the courts a very importantconstituency for supporting them as first-class publicservices.&quot;   ---   LOUISIANA LIMITS banking regulators in suits againstlawyers and accountants.   The new Louisiana law, which takes effect Sept. 1, spellsout the obligations of lawyers and accountants to bankingclients under state law -- and those obligations are muchnarrower than federal regulators have claimed.   The legislation, signed by the Louisiana governor lastweek, is the first counterpunch thrown by lawyers, who saythey have been unfairly targeted as villains in thesavings-and-loan industry scandal. Similar legislation isbeing studied in Ohio.   As part of the federal government's cleanup of the thriftindustry, federal banking regulators have sued lawyers andaccountants for millions of dollars, alleging that theirnegligence accelerated the demise of thrift clients. TheFederal Deposit Insurance Corp. has charged 47 lawyers and 31accountants nationwide with malpractice, says David Barr, anFDIC spokesman. Mr. Barr said 15 legal malpractice actionshave been brought in Louisiana.   Keith Fisher, chairman of an American Bar Association taskforce on lawyers' liability in such cases, said that many ofthe suits appear to hold lawyers to a standard of duty muchhigher than required by state law. Mr. Fisher said somefederal banking regulators have suggested that a lawyer'sduties extend beyond the bank to creditors, the FDIC, equityholders and depositors. With obligations to so many partieswith conflicting interests, a lawyer &quot;wouldn't be able to dothe deal,&quot; Mr. Fisher said.   Banking lawyers, Mr. Fisher said, also are afraid thattheir malpractice rates will zoom if that theory of liabilityprevails. In addition, banking lawyers say it is unfair tosue them under a standard that didn't exist when they advisedtheir thrift clients.   According to David Willenzik, a lawyer who drafted theLouisiana law, the federal government still can bringmalpractice cases against lawyers and accountants. But thegovernment will have to sue under the more restrictivetheories of duties to clients and fiduciaries, Mr. Willenziksaid, which are found in the majority of state lawsregulating professional responsibility.   Mr. Barr said the FDIC &quot;is reserving comment on thelegislation&quot; because it is &quot;too early to tell what impactthese kinds of laws will have.&quot;   Harris Weinstein, chief counsel of the federal Office ofThrift Supervision, has criticized the Louisiana law and thesimilar effort in Ohio. In a conference of bank lawyers heldin Boston this month, Mr. Weinstein said the laws endangerdepositors and the federal insurance fund.   &quot;The rules enforced at OTS are federal, not state, law,&quot;he said. &quot;We have the clear mandate and authority to regulatethrift operations, including the activities of those whoprovide advice for those operations, and we shall continue todo so.&quot;   ---   INSURERS WIN RICO suit over fraudulent trucking insurancescheme.   A federal judge in Los Angeles awarded five largeinsurance companies $65 million in damages against anationwide ring of so-called insurance consultants whomarketed phony off-price policies to truckers.   Lawyers for Fireman's Fund Insurance Co., a unit ofAllianz AG, Germany, and the other plaintiffs said the awardwas among the largest ever in a trucking fraud case. Althoughthe lawyers proved damages of about $20 million, the civilRacketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations law allowedthe trebling of damages, plus attorneys' fees.   &quot;If there's any case that belongs within the statute, thisis it,&quot; said G. Robert Blakey, a professor of law at NotreDame law school who helped draft the RICO law in 1970.&quot;Especially in any interstate business like trucking, statelaws aren't adequate. This law let the insurance companiespull it all together and put in one action with nationwidejurisdiction.&quot; Otherwise, individual states would have had tobring separate proceedings, he said.   John Kozero, a spokesman for Fireman's Fund, said that thecase marked the first use of civil RICO against truckingfraud. Lawyers for the nine defendants, some of whom are inprison in Florida for crimes arising from the scheme,couldn't be reached for comment.   Under the scam, the defendants collected premiums fromtruckers and used some of the money to apply for insurancepolicies under phony company names. They pocketed the rest ofthe money, so the insurance companies didn't receive premiumsfor the actual number of trucks that were believed to beinsured, said Judith Volkart, a lawyer for Fireman's Fund.   ---   CORPORATE LAW DEPARTMENTS struggle to do more with less.   The recession has dealt corporate legal departments adouble blow, according to a study by the newsletter OfCounsel. Companies' overall belt-tightening measures generatework for in-house attorneys, who must review allrestructuring plans. But these same cost-cutting pressureshave also kept staff levels virtually frozen.   &quot;As corporations cut back on their activities, workloadsin the law departments often increase,&quot; said Joel Rose, aPhiladelphia consultant. &quot;In-house attorneys bear an extraburden because they must review downsizing plans, reductions,and other cost-saving measures. At the same time, manycorporate law departments have been experiencing politicalpressure from senior management to control their legalcosts.&quot;   Of Counsel's survey found that the 50 largest corporatelaw departments grew a scant 1.2% from 1989 to 1990, saidLarry Smith, the newsletter's managing editor.   Mergers at Time Warner Inc. and Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.accounted for sharp growth in their in-house legaldepartments; the remaining corporations reported only modestshifts in staffing levels.   With 342 attorneys, Exxon Corp. boasted the largest legaldepartment in the nation. General Electric Co. andInternational Business Machines Corp. tied for second with331 lawyers each.</TEXT></DOC>
