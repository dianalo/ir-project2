The sale, expected to include modern tanks, armoredpersonnel carriers and anti-tank missiles, would be the firstportion of a package of over $20 billion publicly debatedhere in recent days.</LP><TEXT>   Originally, the administration hoped to submit the entirepackage -- including items with a longer delivery time, suchas jet fighters. But supporters of Israel complained that thehuge sale might endanger that nation, so the administrationhas decided to seek urgent items now and defer the rest untilearly next year.   Meanwhile, Turkey's President Turgut Ozal said his nationwould support &quot;armed intervention&quot; against Iraq if it becomesnecessary, provided the action is approved by the UnitedNations.   At a breakfast here with reporters, Mr. Ozal was askedwhether Turkey would remain neutral in any war by the U.S.and its allies against Iraq. He said military force should beconsidered only if the economic embargo fails. But he added:&quot;If the United Nations decides on the armed intervention, wewill not be against it.&quot; He contrasted that stand withTurkey's neutrality in the Iran-Iraq war.   Mr. Ozal's comment was the second in two days by a majorpower hinting that a U.N.-sanctioned military strike againstIraq would be supported if the embargo fails. On Tuesday,Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze warned Baghdadthat the U.N. has the power to &quot;suppress acts of aggression&quot;through force.   Separately, Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney said thePersian Gulf crisis may be entering a period of &quot;danger&quot; inwhich Saddam Hussein &quot;may seek to use his military force totry to break the stranglehold that the embargo has imposed.&quot;   He said the administration is determined &quot;to see to itthat we send enough forces over there so that we don't leavethem exposed and at the end of a long supply line andincrease the risk to any higher level than is warranted.&quot; Heasserted, &quot;The president believes in what I describe as the`don't screw around' school of military strategy.&quot;   And Secretary of State James Baker disclosed that Iraq hasdemanded from the U.S. and other nations a list ofnondiplomats being sheltered in their embassies in Baghdad.Mr. Baker said Iraq has threatened to execute Americans andothers who hide such people, adding: &quot;We've received a noteto that effect. It falls under the heading of the principleof the three R's, I think -- we've read it, it's repugnantand we reject it.&quot;   The latest phase of the economic embargo against Iraq,which covers air traffic, got off to a confused start. Jordancontinued to receive Iraqi passenger flights. The StateDepartment said flights involving only passengers might notbe covered by the embargo but should be barred by an earlierU.N. ban on financial transactions with Iraq. Jordan said itwas reviewing the passenger flights, and U.S. officials saidthe U.N. might have to clarify the passenger-flight issue.Mr. Cheney said the U.S. military hasn't been asked toenforce the air embargo and he doesn't expect that it will doso.   Also, Kuwait's minister of oil and finance, Sheik AliKhalifa al-Sabah, said he believes little more can be done topressure Iraq short of using military force. &quot;It's timeeither for Iraq to bend to the will of the world or be facedwith the military option,&quot; he said.   But Mr. Ozal stressed that the use of force isn't imminentand that the world should wait at least three or four monthsto see if the embargo can force Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait.He said the U.S. hadn't asked Turkey to join in a militarystrike and added: &quot;I don't want to speculate more about it.&quot;   A Turkish role in any military action would be crucial asTurkey borders Iraq and has a powerful army trained by theNorth Atlantic Treaty Organization. Mr. Ozal said &quot;Turkey ison the side of the Western world in this problem.&quot;   The U.S. Export-Import Bank is expected today to clear a$1.37 billion loan guarantee to help Turkey purchase 200military-type helicopters. The helicopters would come fromthe Sikorsky Aircraft Division of United Technologies Corp.,Hartford, Conn., or other U.S. suppliers. The loan guarantee,which would be the largest single financial transaction inthe history of the U.S. export credit agency, was tentativelycleared earlier, and Ex-Im Bank officials said the bank'sboard now could give it final approval because the House andSenate Banking committees haven't raised any objectionsduring a mandatory 25-day review period.   Mr. Ozal, who met with President Bush Tuesday, said hedoubts Iraqi President Saddam Hussein will be overthrown in acoup because of his control over Iraqi society. But he addedthat he thought the Iraqi leader would be ousted if he isforced to give up Kuwait. Because of that, he said,withdrawal will be &quot;very difficult&quot; for Saddam Hussein.   Nevertheless, Mr. Ozal said, Iraq can be forced to move,and the embargo might work. He said it is worth tryingbecause it is unprecedented in history.   Mr. Ozal said the Kuwaiti rulers might lack popularsupport in their own nation if a referendum were held. But hesaid it would be a &quot;grave mistake&quot; to offer any concessionsto Iraq in return for a pullout from Kuwait as that wouldencourage aggression by others and turn the &quot;new world order&quot;into a &quot;jungle.&quot;   The Turkish leader said his nation is sufferingeconomically from the crisis and hasn't yet received promisedcompensation. But he stressed that the financial plight ofTurkey has been &quot;exaggerated&quot; in the press, causing a fewbanks to be unwilling to roll over short-term exportfinancing. He said Turkey would survive the crisiseconomically and shouldn't be lumped together with muchpoorer states as Egypt and Jordan.   Meanwhile, the Treasury issued licensing regulations forthe export of donated food to Iraq and Kuwait. The departmentsaid it will grant export licenses for food shipments &quot;torelieve human suffering&quot; on a case-by-case basis but onlyafter the U.N. has approved each donation. It said such aidmust be provided by humanitarian agencies under U.N.auspices.   So far, the Treasury has had only two inquiries about foodlicenses, said Richard Newcomb, director of the office offoreign assets control.   ---   John T.
