Interior Minister Vadim V. Bakatin appealed to the Supreme Sovietto give his department, which runs the national police, more moneyto stop crime that has risen under President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.   The 542-member Supreme Soviet questioned Bakatin for an hour,then voted to retain the 51-year-old career Communist Party officialas interior minister. Bakatin, who has held his post since October,was subject to confirmation along with nearly 60 other officialsappearing before the Supreme Soviet.   The reconstituted legislature, strengthened by Gorbachev'spolitical reforms, has rejected several candidates to the cabinetand supreme court.   Bakatin told lawmakers that serious crime rose 39.9 percent inthe first half of this year, compared with the same period in 1988.Adolescent crime rose 11 percent last year and 22 percent so farthis year, he said. Unreported crime is growing at three or fourtimes the rate of recorded crime, he said, but did not explain thesource of that figure.   ``Unbalanced development in the economy, politics, social andmoral spheres is inevitable in the transition period through whichSoviet society is going, which in turn provokes tension, shortages,social injustice and thus stimulates crime,'' Bakatin said.   Many Soviets are afraid to walk the streets at night because ofan increase in murders, muggings and rape. Conservatives blame whatthey consider a lax attitude toward youth and say that cooperatives_ private businesses _ have become targets because of their wealth.   Bakatin said government is not spending enough to fight crime.Police salaries are too low and there are shortages of cars, radiosand other equipment, the minister said.   In the United States, Bakatin said, $100 is spent per capita onpolice, whereas in the Soviet Union, the figure is $12.   Gorbachev, presiding at the session, interrupted Bakatin to sayhe had been impressed by the number of police he saw during a visitto West Germany June 12-16.   ``I was in the FRG (Federal Republic of Germany) and was talking,and then I looked around and there were police, police, police.Where did they come from, armed and with equipment?'' he said.   Gorbachev said he was told there is one policeman for every 400Germans. In the Soviet Union, Bakatin reported, there are 17 policefor every 10,000 people, or one for every 588 people.   The Soviet Union once kept crime statistics secret, claimingsocialism was free of the crime rampant in the West. Bakatin saidsuch a policy was foolish.   ``A theory was cultivated for many decades that crime here wasconsidered officially a rudiment of social antagonism fromexploiting societies which should die as socialism developed,''Bakatin said. ``But it didn't.''   Blunt talk also came from another government candidate up forlegislative approval, Health Minister Yevgeny I. Chazov. He toldlegislators the health system is in the ``most severe crisis,'' andsaid:   _ About 63 percent of the nation's hospitals and 59 percent ofclinics are in substandard buildings.   _ About 24 percent of the hospitals have no sewage facilities,and 15 percent lack running water.   _ The Soviet Union spends less money than any developed countryon health care _ 3.2 percent of the Soviet gross national product _versus 6 percent to 8 percent in the United States.   Chazov, formerly the personal physician to Kremlin leadersincluding Leonid I. Brezhnev, was confirmed as health minister.   Parliament turned down one nominee, Mikhail I. Busygin, 58, forthe post of forest industries. Deputies said that Busygin, who hadheld the post since 1982, had paid too little attention toecological problems.   Busygin also has been a non-voting member of the Communist PartyCentral Committee since March 1986, and it was not clear how theparliamentary vote would affect his party post. On April 25,Gorbachev purged the committee of so-called ``dead souls,'' who hadlost their main jobs but remained in the Central Committee.</TEXT></DOC>
