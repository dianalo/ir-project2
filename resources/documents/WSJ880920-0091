Fleming, the nation's largest food wholesaler, said workers will return to work at four Northern California food distribution centers and at centers in Oklahoma City; Kansas City, Kansas; Joplin, Mo.; San Antonio, Texas; and Houston. The unions in those cities have a contract in force and had been striking in sympathy with other locals, Fleming said.    Warehouse workers in Sacramento, Calif., who belong to the International Longshoremen and Warehousemen's Union, also will return to work, Fleming said.    Fleming said it and the Teamsters have agreed to resume negotiations in Fremont, Calif., Sacramento and Fresno, Calif., and at two Phildelphia food distribution centers, where contracts have expired. Those locals will remain on strike, and Fleming said it will continue to use temporary workers to serve customers in those areas.    The strikes are expected to affect Fleming's earnings, although a spokeswoman said the extent of the impact isn't known. About 2,000 workers remain on strike.    Fleming said it tentatively has agreed to withdraw lawsuits against the Teamsters and five locals seeking $21 million in damages, conditioned on the union agreeing to avoid sympathy strikes in the future.    The strikes began in June, when 2,000 workers at six Northern California distribution centers walked out in a dispute over wages.    Fleming stock rose 37.5 cents to close at $32.375 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday. </TEXT></DOC>
