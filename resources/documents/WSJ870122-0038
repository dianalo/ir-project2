By seeking deep wage cuts barely a month after completing its $600 million acquisition of Eastern, Texas Air Corp. yesterday signaled its readiness to endure a high-stakes fight with organized labor to lower Eastern's notoriously high operating costs.    The plan calls for uneven but in many cases severe labor-cost reductions averaging 29% by renegotiating a series of union contracts that don't even begin to expire until year's end. The proposal renews the confrontational labor strategy that Chairman Frank Lorenzo has used in recent years while transforming Houston-based Texas Air into the nation's biggest airline holding company.    &quot;Our labor-cost structure is a cancer,&quot; Philip Bakes, the newly installed president of Eastern, said at a news conference here. &quot;The employees don't like the medicine, but they know it has to be taken.&quot;    Eastern's union leaders vowed to resist at any cost the demand for wage cuts. &quot;The issue of opening our contract is a non-issue,&quot; declared Charles Bryan, the fiery head of the machinists union at Eastern, who was recently removed as a member of the airline's board. Mr. Bryan rejected the company's demand at a news conference and explained in an interview that, &quot;We negotiated an agreement and we don't go back and ask for more. But they come back and ask for less. That's not what an agreement is for . . . . Somewhere along the line, someone is going to tell Frank Lorenzo he has to live within the law.&quot;    Though Eastern cannot legally impose wage reductions during the life of current labor contracts, it was implicit that Texas Air has sources of leverage at its disposal. It could switch Eastern assets into Texas Air's nonunion operations, or launch sweeping layoffs at Eastern to induce union leaders into renegotiating their contracts. Yesterday, the company chose to keep workers guessing.    &quot;We have plans,&quot; Eastern's Mr. Bakes said, &quot;but we aren't prepared to discuss them.&quot;    The demand issued by Mr. Bakes called for a $490 million, or 29%, reduction in Eastern's annual labor costs of $1.7 billion. The costs of mechanics and other maintenance workers would be cut 47%, pilots costs 27% and flight attendants costs 31%. About $40 million of the proposed cost reduction would occur through a plan to offer incentives for retirements or resignations.    Eastern baggage handlers, who as members of the machinists union cost Eastern an average of $43,000 a year, were singled out for special criticism by Mr. Bakes. &quot;The marketplace for people loading and unloading bags is not $43,000 on average,&quot; he said.    Some union officials said yesterday's announcement was a posturing move as part of a recent get-tough campaign by Eastern management. &quot;This whole thing is being orchestrated to create fear and anxiety among employees,&quot; said Robert Callahan, who is completing a term as president of Eastern's flight attendants union. Doom-and-gloom pronouncements in tightening work rules, he said, are intended to encourage employees &quot;to bail out&quot; and thereby leave room for Eastern to hire inexpensive, entry-level employees.    Indeed, the battle lines had already been drawn by weeks of conflict between Eastern's new management and its unions. Flight attendants are being fired for alleged work-rule infractions at a rate six times greater than in pre-Texas Air days. The time required to resolve union grievances, which only recently was several weeks, has grown to a full year. Eastern's pilots have even hired a full-time psychologist to counsel them for heightened job-related stress since Texas Air took the reins.    &quot;It's like working in a war zone,&quot; Mr. Bryan says. Middle-management morale isn't much better. A weary company spokesman says, &quot;In my 20 years at Eastern, it's never been like this.&quot;    Texas Air already has taken some practice swings with its biggest weapons against the unions: switching Eastern planes and routes into the domain of Texas Air's nonunion Continental Airlines unit. Continental is nearly Eastern's size in terms of total traffic, following last week's consolidation of People Express and New York Air into the Continental fold.    Eastern intends to discontinue service to Mexico City and Ottawa, and to end flights between New York's LaGuardia Airport and New Orleans; Continental has recently announced new service on those routes. Eastern's union members increasingly share the fearful vision that Texas Air will be slapping coats of Continental's colors over vast numbers of Eastern planes.    &quot;Lorenzo does have a big club,&quot; says Raymond Neidel, an airline analyst at McCarthy, Crisanti andamp; Maffei Inc., New York. &quot;I wouldn't be at all surprised to see Eastern shrinking rapidly.&quot;    Texas Air insists that nothing short of Eastern's survival is at stake. While annual labor costs average $28,200 for Continental employees, the cost at Eastern averages $43,400. At the same time, Eastern employs a total of 38,000 people to operate 286 planes, while Continental has 30,000 employees and operates 312 planes, according to Eastern. &quot;The unions are living in a dream world,&quot; Mr. Lorenzo said in an interview about Eastern last fall.    Union leaders, on the other hand, believe that Eastern officials are turning their backs on the unions' hard-fought labor contracts to provoke a strike, a slowdown or some other lawful excuse to fire highly paid employees. But the Eastern unions refuse to be induced into striking -- and thereby hope to keep history from repeating itself. Four years ago, Mr. Lorenzo kept a scaled-down Continental flying during a pilots strike and shed Continental's union contracts by thrusting the airline into Chapter 11 bankruptcy-law protection. His hard-nosed tactics, while incurring the enmity of airline unions, have produced big profits at a revived Continental, which recently emerged from the bankruptcy reorganization proceedings.    Circumstances at Eastern differ. Chapter 11 can't be used as a means to break union contracts now, partly because the Continental case moved Congress to revise bankruptcy law. Moreover, some of Eastern's unions already have endured steep salary cuts and tighter work rules in their current contracts. They point to employees of Delta Air Lines, United Airlines and American Airlines, who are paid even higher wages. &quot;We've gone as far as we are going,&quot; says Jack Bavis, head of the Eastern pilots union, which conceded a 20% pay cut in its current contract.    But Texas Air already has proved itself adroit at cutting labor costs. When the company's managers took the helm at Eastern, they furloughed 1,500 employees. Within the past few weeks, 240 more jobs were eliminated. Outside mechanics -- not Eastern's machinists -- are servicing the engines of new Boeing 757 jets, eliminating as many as 300 potential jobs and prompting a union grievance.    In the first nine months of 1986, Eastern had a $136.7 million loss, on revenue of $3.40 billion, compared with a year-earlier profit of $73.8 million, or 99 cents a share, on revenue of $3.69 billion. For the same period, Texas Air earned $73.7 million, or $2.65 a share, a 40% drop from the year-earlier profit of $122.6 million, or $7.65 a share, on a 13% rise in revenue to $1.66 billion from $1.45 billion. Texas Air's latest results were hurt by a much lower gain from a tax-loss carry-forward.    Even before yesterday's announcement, the war of nerves was being waged on a number of other fronts. The unions, which still are trying to undo Texas Air's acquisition of Eastern through the federal courts, have dipped into their war chests to hire the high-profile attorney F. Lee Bailey. Texas Air countersued the unions over their own abortive attempts to mount a takeover of Eastern.    The serious labor issues are aggravated by increasingly bitter personal conflicts. Two weeks ago, Mr. Bryan's machinists union members presented him with a plaque bearing a laminated newspaper photo of him shouting down an Eastern board member. Eastern executives were furious that Mr. Bryan accepted the plaque at a lunchtime gathering of several hundred workers on an Eastern airport ramp in Miami.    In a letter to Mr. Bryan, John Adams, Eastern's vice president, labor relations, called the event a &quot;public soap opera,&quot; adding, &quot;You will no longer be allowed unlimited access to company property because you have so abused that extraordinary privilege.&quot; Mr. Bryan's free-travel pass for Eastern flights also was confiscated.    The two sides aren't even on speaking terms. Mr. Lorenzo has refused to speak by phone to union officials and wouldn't answer their telegram seeking a meeting about the future of the airline. On the other hand, when Eastern's Mr. Adams wrote the flight attendants union about contractual issues, the union's Mr. Callahan simply marked some grammatical corrections in red ink, and returned it to the sender.    Eastern passengers may be caught in the middle of the cross fire. &quot;We are flying on filthy, dirty planes,&quot; fumes Mary Jane Barry, president-elect of the flight attendants union, because the airline cut back on cleaning crews. Flight attendants now are being called upon to pick up the trash from the floor, which they say is a violation of their contract.    These conflicts can provoke more terminations, she says, because a flight attendant who refuses to clean the plane risks getting fired for insubordination. On top of that, management last week tightened the policy on absences to such a point that at least 600 flight attendants suddenly discovered that they were in immediate jeopardy of being fired. Amid all the changes, official grievances are being pursued in record numbers.    Even after yesterday's announcement, union leaders said they still won't be drawn into a panicky response. &quot;My reaction is to tell people not to run for the nearest exit,&quot; says Mr. Callahan of the flight attendants union. &quot;There's no reason for us to do anything. We have closed contracts.&quot;    ---   Also contributing to this article were Steve Frazier in Houston and Thomas E.
