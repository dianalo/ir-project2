 At its heart,Notes embodies an idea and a technology first computerized about a decadeago: the humble &quot;BBS.&quot;andP;  Accessible to anyone with a computer, a modem, and aphone line, most public Bulletin Board Systems allow the user to call in,send and receive electronic mail, and participate in conferences.andP;  In mostconferences, users have the unrestricted right to read messages from otherusers and to respond to those messages.andP;  In essence, the public BBS is arich, accesible database of ideas that uses software to organize and delivera coherent group of messages to its users.andM;Enter the office LAN, and you have the ideal environment for a more advancedkind of group communication.andP;  Throw in the graphical user interface ofMicrosoft Windows of OS/2 Presentation Manager, an enormously powerfuldatabase capability, and an easily understood desktop metaphor, and you haveNotes.andM;Notes is probably the heartiest offering available in today's assortment ofnetwork-application software.andP;  It combines database management, text searchand retrieval, electronic mail, and customizable applications under agraphical user interface.andP;  Its internal construction--an accessible interfacetied to one or more databases--elevates the network from a simple electronicmessenger or file deliverer to a true software community.andM;Though it includes E-mail, file-transfer mechanisms, and even shades of theever-popular fax machines, Notes can be more useful than all of them.andP;  Inthose media, messages and documents are sent as discrete items from theauthor to one or more recipients.andP;  Other users are excluded from thecommunication.andM;Because N otes stores its messages and documents in databases, users with theappropriate security clearances can monitor and respond to the messages.andP;  Ineffect, Notes creates a communcition database for the benefit of the group.andM;The Database Is The KeyandM;Notes databases store information, including documents and E-mail, the wayconventional databases do--in records, fields, and indexes.andP;  But none of thatis readily apparent to a Notes user.andP;  Rather, the Notes metaphor of theeveryday desktop extends to just about everything under its control; forexample, records are &quot;documents,&quot; and reports are &quot;views.&quot;andM;Notes information can be viewed in a variety of ways.andP;  Views can showselected segments of information that can be sorted by author, subject, date,or any other field in a Notes database.andM;Notes databases are generally not stored on a user's hard disk but on one ormore Notes database servers.andP;  This makes information accessible to a group ofusers and qualifies Notes for the vaunted label groupware.andP;  Notes can beaccessed by users at a single location or by users across the country througha dial-up connection.andM;Instead of sending faxes, memos, or E-mail, you can put reports in a Notesdatabase.andP;  Other Notes users on the network can then access the database andadd responses and comments to the reports.andP;  These comments appear in thedatabase as addenda to the original document, with dates, subjects, andauthors duly noted.andP;  According to most users and Notes administrators, thiscreates a free flow of ideas and information around a company.andM;Notes Goes On-LineandM;Several companies-including Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co., ReutersInformation Services, and Price Waterhouse, all in New York--are are usingNotes.andP;  One of the most immediate benefits of Notes is its ability tostreamline information sharing within a company and greatly reduce paperhandling and telephone calling.andP;  &quot;Notes has the potential to replace withelectronics the mess of paper on my desk,&quot; says James Outman, manager ofcorporate information services at Reuters.andM;But smoother information sharing within the company is just one of the waysReuters is exploiting Notes' capabilities.andP;  Reuters provides on-line news andfinancial information to companies and stock markets around the world.andO;Hence, Reuters plans to use this innovative program to disseminate real-timenews to networked PCs.andP;  Lotus Development Corp. has written an interfacebetween the Notes server and the Reuters news wire.andP;  With this interface,news stories can be categorized and viewed, for example, by specificcompanies of subjects.andM;Eventually, Reuters intends to use the Notes interface to offer new on-linenews services to companies that run Windows on multiple PCs over networks.andO;Reuters will be able to offer the services to businesses outside itstraditional arena of trading rooms, stock markets, and news organizations.andO;Financial-services companies, accounting firms, and other large corporationscould use on-line information about customers and news events instead ofrelying on newspapers.andP;  &quot;There may be other database programs available,&quot;says Outman, &quot;but none with the communications capabilities of Notes.&quot;andM;Sales NetandM;One company that plans to take advantage of the new Notes-enabled Reutersservice is Manufacturers Hanover Trust.andP;  Last year the bank, a Notes testsite, used the program to develop a pilot customer-information system forlending officers and corporate trust officers.andP;  Manufacturers plans to usebusiness news imported from the Reuters service to keep account officersbetter informed about customers and trends.andM;Today Manufacturers uses Notes as a sales tool.andP;  The program is extremelywell-suited to the trend toward &quot;relationship banking,&quot; in which the banktracks a customer's total financial status and all the bank products andservices he or she uses, rather than simply processing transactions in thecustomer's accounts.andP;  Relationship banking allows banks to develop newproducts suited to the needs of its customers.andP;  Selling more products to oldcustomer's is more profitable than trying to attract new customers, somebankers say.andM;Before testing Notes, Manufacturers conducted a yearlong study of accountmanagers' tasks to determine how they could improve their jobs.andP;  One problemthat surfaced was the inaccessibility of customer information.andP;  Thisinformation was available only to the officer making the customer contact,which meant that other officers who dealt with the customer didn't know, forexample, if a crucial new deal had just been struck with the customer for anew product or if the customer was in the market for a new loan.andM;Moreover, tracking the information to which they did have access was aproblem.andP;  Managers already had much of the information on personal computersand used E-mail to communicate with each other.andP;  But gathering customerinformation to prepare a report involved a mad scramble through electronicand paper files.andP;  &quot;We saw that having customer information at the managers'fingertips was high on the list,&quot; says Christine Thompson, assistant vicepresident in the decision-support services group and a developer of Notesapplications at the bank.andP;  &quot;They wanted to have all the information in justone place.&quot;andM;Using the results of its study, Manufacturers built Notes databases for itsindividual corporate customers.andP;  The databases house su h information as thecustomer's financial profile, the bank products it currently uses, additionalproducts it has been offered, and reports from sales calls.andM;&quot;Now the account officer has it all in Notes and just chooses from thedatabases what is needed,&quot; says Thompson.andP;  &quot;Notes can deal with textualinformation that doesn't fir into the structure of traditionalmanagement-information systems,&quot; she adds.andM;Groups of account officers electronically access and share these databaseswith just a few keystrokes.andP;  The system increases the officers' productivitybecause they no longer have to rifle through paper files or probe electronicword-processing and spreadsheet files for sales-call reports andprofitability statements.andP;  Instead, the officers can spend more timeanalyzing and managing accounts and developing marketing strategies.andM;A favorite feature of the Notes system is a database that lets accountofficers record sales-call reports and notes about phone conservations andmeetings with customers.andP;  Built into the sytem is a tickler file that remindsofficers when it's time to make follow-up calls or arrange meetings.andM;Account officers also like the search mechanism, which lets them quickly andeasily search through customer profiles for specific subsets of information.andO;&quot;If I need to know which of my companies has a subsidiary in Honduras and haspaid taxes there, I can sort through the files in my database to find theinformation,&quot; says Mary Beth Fender-Mieth, an assistant vice president inManufacturers' North American group for large corporate and multi-nationalaccounts.andP;  &quot;We had no sort capabilities before.andP;  Some of the information wasin a 1-2-3 spreadsheet, some was in word-processing documents, and it wasdifficult to sort through it all.&quot;andM;A STEW OF HOT TOPICSandM;The sort capability has also come in handy at Price Waterhouse, a Big Sixaccounting firm.andP;  Over 1,000 employees in 22 offices around the country areusing Notes.andP;  Early this year the company purchased 10,000 copies of theprogram, which will be deployed over a three-year period.andM;Price Waterhouse's Financial Services Industry Practice Group developed adatabase for &quot;hot topics&quot;--all kinds of business issues that affect theirfinancial-services clients.andP;  The database is organized by subject, such ashighly leveraged transactions, money laundering, risk-based capital, realestate, and trading versus investment.andP;  The database has over 30 differenttopics now and more are being developed every day.andM;Before the switch to Notes, information was either faxed to offices acrossthe country or included in Price Waterhouse's monthly Financial ServicesInternal Newsletters.andP;  If officers wanted information on a certain subject,they had to look for it amid the newsletter summaries or the memos--if theyhadn't already discarded them.andM;&quot;The hot-topics database gets the information out to people the fastest,&quot;said Diane Altneu, senior manager in the financial-services group in NewYork.andP;  &quot;It's not like we've never had access to the information before.andP;  Butit involved paper, phone calls, and faxes.andP;  Now, you just call it up and it'sthere.&quot;andM;Documents in the hot-topics database, as in all Notes databases, appear in alist that includes each document's topic, author, and date.andP;  Comments appearbeneath each document.andP;  Documents can easily pile up in a database, but acustom purge mechanism deletes them periodically.andM;Price Waterhouse has found that databases are easily created and requirelittle programming.andP;  &quot;One of the nicest features is that someone with noprogramming experience can design an application and have it go live in acouple of hours,&quot; said Keith Wishon, managing partner for the West region ofthe financial-services group at Price Waterhouse.andP;  Notes contains sampledatabases--for example, a database for a discussion group or for customertracking.andP;  &quot;You just modify parts of the sample to fit your group,&quot; saysWishon.andM;While Notes has a long way to go before it replaces paper at PriceWaterhouse, Wishon says it is beginning to stem the tide of paper documents.andO;&quot;I never print out most of the things I receive on Notes,&quot; he says.andP;  &quot;But wehaven't hit a critical mass of users.andP;  That's when you reduce the amount ofpaper that you have to handle every day.&quot;andM;BEYOND THE GROUPandM;Lotus believes that Notes' E-mail function will become more popular asgateways to other E-mail programs are developed.andP;  &quot;A big focus of thedevelopment effort for Notes was to allow for the consolidation ofinformation from other places,&quot; says Lotus's Eric Sall, director of businessapplications for Notes.andP;  Touch Communications is developing a gateway thatwill let users of Notes exchange messages with users of MCI Mail and ATandamp;TMail.andP;  And Soft-Switch and Lotus are now developing a gateway between Notesand Soft-Switch Central, a &quot;message backbone&quot; that connects more than 40messaging systems, including HP Desk and IBM's Profs.andM;In the meantime, proponents of Notes, such as James Outman at Reuters, saythat the biggest marketing challenge currently facing Lotus is to explainwhat the program is.andP;  Because it offers so much more than traditional E-mailand database-management programs, it's hard to describe what Notes can do.andM;But while the groupware concept may be difficult to explain, Outman believesthat Notes places exceptional power in the hands of its users.andP;  &quot;When peoplehave the ability to sort through documents and communicate the way Notes letsthem, they will find a need for those functions that they never had before.&quot;andM;WHAT YOU NEED FOR NOTESandM;Notes uses the client-server computing model to connect DOS and OS/2workstations via LANs to OS/2 servers.andP;  Databases and communications powerare housed on the servers, which distribute information to clientworkstations.andM;To use Notes, you need an IBM PC AT, PS/2 Model 60, 70, or 80, Compaq Deskpro286, 386, or compatibles.andP;  On the client workstation side, you need a minimumof 4 megabytes of memory for an OS/2 system or a minimum of 640K on a DOSsystem.andP;  For the OS/2 server, you need 5 megabytes of memory.andP;  Notes runsunder the DOS and OS/2 versions of Novell, 3Com, and IBM network operatingsystems.andM;Existing information can be imported into Notes from a wide range ofword-processing, graphics, and spreadsheet programs, including 1-2-3,Symphony, Lotus Freelance Plus, and Agenda, as well as such non-Lotusprograms as WordPerfect, Microsoft Word, and WordStar.andM;The Notes programming system, 200 licenses, 10 sets of documentation,installation, and support cost $62,500.andP;  Additional licenses cost $295 percomputer.andM;Karen Gullo is a technology writer at American Banker.andP;  She was a senioreditor at InformationWeek and a writer and editor at Datamation.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
