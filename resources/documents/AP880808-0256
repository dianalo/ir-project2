(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Phillips Petroleum Co. will sell itsoil and gas holdings in the Williston Basin of Montana and NorthDakota to Conoco for an undisclosed sum, company officialsannounced Monday.   The sale is part of Phillips' strategy to divest non-strategicassets, company spokesman Dan Harrison said.   ``It did not have a good fit for us,'' Harrison said ofWilliston Basin.   Since 1985, Phillips has sold gas plants at Williston and Tioga,N.D., Harrison said.   Conoco, a subsidiary of Du Pont Co., will obtain Phillips'interest in about 175 oil and gas wells that produce about 4,000barrels of oil and 2.8 million cubic feet of natural gas a day.   Also included in the sale are 234,000 undeveloped acres ineastern Montana and western North Dakota.   Harrison said Phillips' interest in the Williston propertyamounted to about 2,000 barrels of oil and 1 million cubic feet ofgas a day. He said Phillips' U.S. production last year was 113,000barrels of oil and 772 million cubic feet of natural gas a day.   Industry analysts say the amount of domestic oil and gasreserves up for sale has about doubled in the past year because ofthe market created by high exploration costs.   The transactions usually reflect the seller's need to reducedebt and the buyer's desire for proven production at a cost lowerthan that of exploring for new reserves, the analysts said.</TEXT></DOC>
