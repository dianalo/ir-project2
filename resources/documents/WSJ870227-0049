The agreement provides lump-sum payments of 10% in the first year and 6% in each of the next two years for the 4,600 International Association of Machinists andamp; Aerospace Workers members at the company's Chula Vista and Riverside, Calif., plants. Rohr, a maker of aerospace parts, said the first payments will be made in April.    The company said it will continue to pay quarterly cost-of-living adjustments in cash, as in the prior agreement.    Other benefits include provisions for earlier retirement and improvements in the company-paid medical, dental and life insurance plans.    &quot;We were victorious in the labor dispute,&quot; said Tom Hurd, a union negotiator. &quot;I'm pleased we took this company on.&quot; Mr. Hurd said, however, that Rohr plans to dismiss several employees from the Riverside plant for alleged involvement in rock-throwing and destruction of property during the strike. A company spokesman wouldn't comment on such firings.    The spokesman for Rohr, which has total employment of 8,500, said the company had continued to make deliveries during the strike. </TEXT></DOC>
