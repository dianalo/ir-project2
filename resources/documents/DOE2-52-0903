Ductile strata may be area-balanced if originalthickness is known. Near Ventura, folds in Pliocene-Pleistocene turbiditesand Miocene-early Pliocene shales (Rincon, Monterey, Sisquoc) overliean unfolded competent Paleogene sequence. The basal decollement of thefoldbelt is in the ductile Rincon Formation (lower Miocene). The overlyingSulphur Mountain, Ventura Avenue, San Miguelito, and Rincon anticlinesare fault-propagation folds developing from south-dipping, largely lateQuaternary frontal ramp thrusts (Sisar-Big Canyon-Lion fault set, Barnardfault set, padre Juan fault, and C-3 fault, respectively) that rise fromthe decollement. Cross-section balancing shows that the overlying fold-thrustbelt has shortened 2.5-6 km more than subjacent Paleogene competent strata.This excess bed length is taken up in the Paleogene sequence on the OakRidge fault as a ramp from the brittle-plastic transition zone throughthe upper crust. This implies that the basal decollement is the frontalactive thrust of the Oak Ridge fault. The decollement dies out southeastof a line between Timber Canyon oil field and the west end of Oak Ridge,possibly because of decreased ductility in the Miocene decollement sequencedue to appearance of sandstone interbeds. Farther southeast, late Quaternarydisplacement concentrated on the Oak Ridge fault itself at rates greaterthan 10 mm/year.</TEXT></DOC>
