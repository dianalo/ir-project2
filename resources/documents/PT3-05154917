As      viewed by the consumer, the liquids in the compartments are of different      colors, but when liquids are dispensed from the bottle they combine to      form a liquid of yet another color. </PAR><PAR>  In particular, the mouthrinse product of the invention comprises a bottle      having a plurality of separate compartments each having its own open spout      through which liquid stored therein may be dispensed. Each of the      compartments is filled with an orally acceptable liquid, at least one of      the liquids having a first color and at least another of the liquids      having a second color, the liquids being out of contact with one another      while they are stored in the compartments and the bottle having at least a      transparent portion through which the liquids stored within the      compartments may be seen. The compartments and spouts are arranged such      that when the bottle is tipped from a normal vertical non-dispensing      position to a dispensing position, the liquids will flow out of the      compartments via the open spouts, and, after they exit the bottle, will be      combined to form a liquid of a third color. Completing the mouthrinse      product is a removable cap means for sealingly closing the open spouts. </PAR><PAR>  In order to provide this dramatic color-change effect, the liquids having      the first color are at a first pH, at least one of the other liquids is at      a second pH and the dispensed liquid admixture is at a third pH; the      liquids having the first color comprising an orally acceptable dye having      one color at the first pH and another color at the third pH. Orally      acceptable indicator dyes, such as phenolphthalein, may be used as the dye      that changes color depending on pH. </PAR><PAR>  Completing the mouthrinse product is a therapeutically effective amount of      an oral hygiene medicament in at least one of the liquids stored in the      bottle. Preferably, at least one of the liquids in the bottle comprises      one part of a two-part orally acceptable effervescent couple, while at      least another of the liquids comprises the other part of the effervescent      couple, the two parts of the effervescent couple reacting to produce      carbon dioxide when the liquids are combined after they have been      dispensed from the bottle </PAR></BSUM><DRWD> <PAR>  The present invention is illustrated in terms of its preferred embodiments      in the accompanying drawings, in which: </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 1 is an elevational view of a mouthrinse bottle and cap; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 2 is a view in section taken along lines 2--2 in FIG. 1; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 3 is a detail view, in section, of the cap assembled to the bottle; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 4 is a view in perspective of red, colorless and blue liquids being      dispensed from the bottle and forming an aqua mouthrinse when combined; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 5 is an elevational view, partly in section, of an alternative      embodiment of the invention; and </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 6 is a view in section taken along lines 6--6 in FIG. 5. </PAR></DRWD><DETD> <PAR>  FIG. 1 shows a mouthrinse product of the invention comprising a bottle 1      and cap 2. Bottle 1 contains red, colorless and blue liquids in      compartments 3, 4 and 5, respectively. When the bottle 1 is tipped as      shown in FIG. 4, the liquids are separately dispensed from compartments 3,      4, 5 and are then combined in cap 4 to form an aqua orally acceptable      mouthrinse M. The composition of the liquids will be discussed in detail      hereinafter. </PAR><PAR>  As best seen in FIG. 2, each of compartments 3, 4, 5 is defined by its own      continuous wall 3a, 4a, 5a respectively, compartment 4 being joined to      compartments 3 and 5 by means of webs 6 that extend from the bottom of the      bottle 1 to the spouts 3b, 4b, 5b (FIG. 3). In this manner, the liquids in      compartments 3, 4, 5 are prevented from contacting one another while they      are stored in the compartments. </PAR><PAR>  On its front and rear surfaces, bottle 1 is provided with ribs 7 that      cooperate with ribs 8 provided inside cap 2, whereby cap 2 may be      snap-fitted onto bottle 1 and readily disengaged therefrom. Cap 2 is also      provided with flexible gasket 9 that enters spouts 3b, 4b, 5b when cap 2      is snapped onto bottle 1, thereby sealingly closing the spouts. </PAR><PAR>  Preferably bottle 1 and cap 2 are each made of plastic. Conveniently,      bottle 1 is formed by blow-molding, while cap 2 is injection molded. If      desired, however, bottle 1 may be of glass or other suitable material,      while cap 2 may be of metal, rubber or the like. </PAR><PAR>  Most preferably, bottle 1 is made of a transparent material, such as a      transparent plastic, so that all of the liquids stored in bottle 1 can be      seen. If desired, however, only part of bottle 1 may be transparent. </PAR><PAR>  While bottle 1 has three compartments, the bottle used in the present      invention may have two compartments or more than three compartments. Thus,      FIGS. 5 and 6 show a mouthrinse product comprising bottle 20 having      compartments 21 and 22 defined by walls 21a and 22a, respectively, that      are joined together via common wall 23 without any intermediate web.      Compartments 21 and 22 terminate in spouts 24 to which are screw threaded      caps 25 to sealingly close spouts 24. Other bottles suitable for use in      the present invention include the multi-compartment bottles of U.S. design      Pat. Nos. 189,932, 190,101, 214,549, 287,571, 288,526 and 290,225 and U.S.      Pat. No. 3,729,553. </PAR><PAR>  Bottle 1 has a distinctive shape provided by the upwardly tapering walls 3a      and 5a and by the rectangular cross-section of compartment 4 and the      semi-circular cross-sections of compartments 3 and 5. However, any      suitable shape may be used such as provided by the uniform, circular      cross-section of compartments 21 and 22 of bottle 20. </PAR><PAR>  Compartments 3, 4, 5 and 21, 22 and spouts 3b, 4b, 5b and 25 are      proportioned such that the ratio of the liquids dispensed from      compartments 3, 4, 5 or 21 22 to form the dispensed mouthrinse M will      provide the desired reaction between the liquids and preferably will      ensure that substantially all of the liquids in compartments 3, 4, 5 or      21, 22 are emptied at about the same time. It is presently preferred to      provide each of compartments 3, 4, 5 and 21, 22 with substantially the      same volume, whereby each compartment will contain substantially the same      amount of liquid, and to provide spouts 3b, 4b, 5b or 25 with the same      cross-sectional area, whereby the liquids in compartments 3, 4, 5 or 21,      22 are dispensed from the bottle 1 or 20 at substantially the same flow      rate and in substantially the same amount. </PAR><PAR>  In a presently preferred embodiment of the invention, compartments 3, 4, 5      contain red, colorless and blue liquids, respectively. The red liquid has      an alkaline pH and contains phenolphthalein and a yellow dye, while the      blue liquid contains a blue dye and the colorless water-white liquid      contains no dyes. The blue and colorless liquids may both be at acid pH or      one may be acidic and the other may be substantially neutral. </PAR><PAR>  The red liquid is red because phenolphthalein is red at alkaline pH, the      small amount of yellow dye being masked or hidden by the phenolphthalein.      When bottle 1 is tipped from the vertical, non-dispensing position to the      dispensing position shown in FIG. 4, the liquids will flow out of      compartments 3, 4, 5 and be admixed in cap 2 to form the mouthrinse M. The      consumer would expect the liquids to combine to form a purple mouthrinse      M. However, the liquid or liquids at acid pH will react with the red      liquid to form a mouthrinse M of pH from about 5.0 to about 8.5. At a pH      in the range of about 5.0 to about 8.5, the phenolphthalein in the      mouthrinse M becomes colorless, and mouthrinse M is thus aqua resulting      from the blue and yellow dyes in mouthrinse M, contrary to the consumer's      expectation (Of course, the liquids can be dispensed into any suitable cup      or glass, if desired, rather than into cap 2.) </PAR><PAR>  Compartments 21 and 22 of bottle 20 may be filled with the red and blue      liquids described above, whereby after they are dispensed from bottle 20      the liquids will also combine to form an aqua mouthrinse M (not shown). </PAR><PAR>  Preferably, when alkaline and acidic liquids are used, they will contain an      orally acceptable base and an orally acceptable acid, respectively, as a      two-part effervescent couple, so that mouthrinse M will be effervescent,      resulting from carbon dioxide bubbles B formed by the reaction between the      acid in the acidic liquid and the base in the alkaline liquid. Thus, the      three-colored mouthrinse in bottle 1 will dispense a mouthrinse M of a      fourth and different color, the effervescence being a preferred but      optional feature. The consumer appeal of the product results from a unique      combination of container construction and dye chemistry </PAR><PAR>  All references herein to &quot;color&quot; and &quot;colors&quot; includes colors of any hue      and intensity, including black, white and colorless. Moreover, the liquids      may comprise an opacifying agent, such as droplets of mineral oil, to      provide a pastel effect. </PAR><PAR>  While phenolphthalein is used in the above description and the following      Examples, other orally acceptable indicator dyes can be used if they      provide a color change at the pH of the dispensed mouthrinse, namely when      at a pH in the range of from about 5.0 to about 9.0. See, for example,      Food Chemical Codex, Third Edition, National Academy Press, Washington,      D.C., 1981, pages 568-569, which describes orally acceptable indicator      dyes. Useful orally acceptable indicator dyes include bromocresol purple      (pH 5.2 yellow to pH 6.8 purple), bromothymol blue (pH 6.0 yellow to pH      7.6 blue), cresol red (pH 7.2 yellow to pH 8.8 blue), neutral red (pH 6.8      red to pH 8.0 orange), phenol red (pH 6.8 yellow to pH 8.2 red), thymol      blue (pH 1.2 red to pH 8.0 yellow: pH 9.2 blue to pH 8.0 yellow). </PAR><PAR>  The present invention thus provides a mouthrinse product wherein at least      one of the liquids in a multi-compartment bottle contains an orally      acceptable indicator dye that has different colors at different pH values      and at least one of the other liquids in the bottle will provide the      dispensed mouthrinse with a pH at which the indicator dye changes color.      If the indicator dye, like phenolphthalein, becomes colorless, then the      liquids in the compartments of the bottle may employ the &quot;hidden&quot; dye      technique described above so that the mouthrinse M is different in color      than any of the liquids in the bottle. However, where the indicator dye is      not colorless when in its compartment or in the combined mouthrinse      mixture, such as bromocresol purple, then it is possible to use the      indicator dye as the sole dye in any of the liquids in the bottle. In such      cases, two liquids can be stored in separate compartments in the bottle,      one liquid containing the indicator dye and being at a first pH and the      other being colorless or containing a suitable dye and being at a second      pH, whereby the liquids after they are dispensed from the bottle will form      a mouthrinse mixture at a third pH having a different color than any of      the liquids in the bottle. </PAR><PAR>  The mouthrinse of the invention will also include a therapeutically      effective amount of an oral hygiene medicament. All of the liquids in the      multi-compartment bottle may contain the oral hygiene medicament or the      oral hygiene medicament may be in only some of the liquids. For example,      if one of the liquids is at a pH that will adversely affect the oral      hygiene medicament, then the medicament will be located in one of the      other liquids. Any of the oral hygiene medicaments suitable for use in a      mouthrinse product may be used in the present invention, such as      anti-caries agents, anti-calculus agents, anti-plaque agents,      anti-microbial agents or the like. </PAR><PAR>  Suitable anti-caries agents include fluoride ion sources, such as alkali      metal fluorides, alkali metal monofluorophosphates, stannous fluoride and      the like. Preferably, an alkali metal fluoride, most preferably sodium      fluoride, will be used. When employed, the anti-caries agent is used in an      anti-caries effective amount. For example, fluoride ion sources may be      used in an amount sufficient to provide from about 25 ppm to about 1000      ppm, preferably from about 25 to about 300 ppm fluoride, based on the      total weight of the mouthrinse. </PAR><PAR>  Suitable anti-calculus agents include the linear molecularly dehydrated      polyphosphate salts, including alkali metal tripolyphosphates and      pyrophosphates, such as sodium tripolyphosphate, di- and/or tetrasodium      pyrophosphate, di- and/or tetrapotassium pyrophosphate and the like. If      necessary, stabilizing agents may be used with the anti-calculus agent.      Suitably, the polyphosphate anti-calculus agent may be used in an amount      of up to about 5%, preferably from about 0.5 to about 2%, by weight, based      on the total weight of the mouthrinse. As described in Gaffar et al U.S.      Pat. No. 4,627,977, the linear polyphosphates may be used in combination      with an amount of a fluoride ion source sufficient to provide about 25 to      about 1000 ppm fluoride ions and about 0.005 to about 3% by weight, based      on the total weight of the mouthrinse, of a synthetic anionic linear      polymeric polycarboxylate having a molecular weight of from about 2000 to      about one million, as inhibitors of enzymatic hydrolysis of the      polyphosphate anti-calculus agent. In this connection, the fluoride ion      source, when used, may serve both as an anti-caries agent and an enzyme      inhibitor. </PAR><PAR>  In one embodiment of the invention, the mouthrinse provides anti-calculus      and anti-plaque activity, wherein the oral hygiene medicament comprises a      water-soluble alkali metal tripolyphosphate salt and a substantially      water-insoluble noncationic anti-bacterial agent, whereby the mouthrinse      is useful in the treatment of gum disease. In such cases, one or more of      the liquids in the bottle will contain an orally acceptable alcoholic      solubilizing agent to solubilize the water-insoluble anti-bacterial      noncationic agent. Useful noncationic anti-bacterial agents include      compounds of formula (I):      ##STR1##      in which R.sup.1 is oxygen, sulphur, or alkylene of from one to six carbon      atoms and each of R.sup.2 to R.sup.6 and R.sup.12 to R.sup.16 is hydrogen,      hydroxyl or halogen; phenolic or bisphenolic compounds; benzoate esters;      or halogenated carbanilides. Suitable compounds of formula (I) include      5,5'-dichloro-2,2'-dihydroxydiphenylmethane,      2,2'-dihydroxy-3,5,6,3',5',6'-hexachlorodiphenylmethane,      3,3'-dibromo-5,5'-dichloro-2,2'-dihydroxydiphenylether, and preferably      2,4,4'-trichloro-2'-hydroxydiphenylether (triclosan). </PAR><PAR>  Examples of phenolic compounds, which include the halogenated      salicylanilides, include, for example, 2-phenylphenol, 4-chlorophenol,      4-chloro-3-methylphenol, 4-chloro-3-methylphenol,      4-chloro-3,5-dimethylphenol, 2,4-dichloro-3,5-dimethylphenol,      5-methyl-2-pentylphenol, 4-isopropyl-3-methylphenol,      5-chloro-2-hydroxydiphenylmethane, 4',5-dibromosalicylanilide,      3,4',5-tribromosalicylanilide, 2,3,3',5-tetrachlorosalicylanilide,      3,3',4,5'-tetrachlorosalicylanilide,      3,5-dibromo-3'-trifluoromethylsalicylanilide, and      5-n-octanoyl-3'-trifluoromethylsalicylanilide. </PAR><PAR>  Examples of bisphenolic compounds include, for example,      2,2'-methylenebis(3,4,6-trichlorophenol),      2,2'-methylenebis(4-chlorophenol), 2,2'-methylenebis(4-chloro-6-bromo      bis(2-hydroxy-3,5-dichlorophenyl)sulphide, and      bis(2-hydroxy-5-chlorophenyl)sulphide. </PAR><PAR>  Examples of benzoate esters include, for example, esters of hydroxybenzoic      acid, especially the methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl, isobutyl,      hexyl, heptyl and benzyl esters. </PAR><PAR>  Examples of halogenated carbanilides include, for example,      3,4,4'-trichlorocarbanilide, 3-trifluoromethyl-4,4'-dichlorocarbanilide,      and 3,3',4-trichlorocarbanilide. </PAR><PAR>  Suitably, the noncationic anti-bacterial agent will be used in an amount of      from about 0.01 to about 2%, preferably about 0.05 to about 1.0%, by      weight, based on the total weight of the mouthrinse. </PAR><PAR>  Generally, the mouthrinse of the invention will comprise from about 45 to      about 95%, by weight of water, based on the total weight of the      mouthrinse, and the pH of the mouthrinse formed after the liquids      dispensed from the bottle are combined will usually be substantially      neutral, although depending on the indicator dye used, a pH of from about      5.0 to about 9.0 may be useful. </PAR><PAR>  When an effervescent mouthrinse is desired, an effervescent couple is      provided comprising an orally acceptable acid and an orally acceptable      base, the effervescent couple reacting to produce carbon dioxide. Of      course, the acid and base will be present in separate liquids stored in      separate compartments to prevent premature reaction of the couple. Useful      orally acceptable acids include organic acids, such as citric acid,      tartaric acid, malic acid, fumaric acid and the like, while useful orally      acceptable bases include metal carbonate and bicarbonate salts, such as      alkali or alkaline earth metal carbonates and bicarbonates and the like. A      presently preferred effervescent couple is citric acid and a sodium      bicarbonatesodium carbonate mixture. Suitably, each moiety of the      effervescent couple may be present in an amount of from about 0.5 to about      6% by weight, based on the weight of the liquid containing the moiety. As      is known, the larger the amount of the effervescent couple, the more gas      bubbles will be produced. </PAR><PAR>  Various optional conventional oral hygiene components may also be included,      such as orally acceptable alcohols, excipients, detergents, buffering      agents, flavoring agents, sweetening agents and the like. Preferably, the      mouthrinse contains from about 1 to about 20% of glycerine, sorbitol or      propylene glycol or the like to provide body and proper &quot;mouthfeel&quot;. </PAR><PAR>  Conventional manufacturing techniques are used to prepare the bottle and      mouthrinse of the invention. The mouthrinse is used as described above by      dispensing the liquids the bottle to form the mouthrinse and applying it      to the teeth and other surfaces of the oral cavity. </PAR><PAR>  The present invention is illustrated in terms of its preferred embodiments      in the accompanying Examples. All parts and percentages referred to in      this specification and the appended claims are by weight based upon the      total weight of the mouthrinse, unless otherwise specified. </PAR><PAC>  EXAMPLE 1 </PAC><PAR>  Red, blue and colorless liquids were prepared by admixing the following      ingredients: </PAR><TBL>  ______________________________________                                                       RED      BLUE      COLORLESS                                     INGREDIENTS   LIQUID   LIQUID    LIQUID                                        ______________________________________                                         Deionized Water                                                                              67.224   74.0678   71.230                                        Ethanol, 190 Proof                                                                           14.480   12.5000   12.500                                        Glycerin      12.000   12.0000   12.000                                        Sodium Bicarbonate                                                                           2.190    --        --                                            Sodium Carbonate                                                                             2.800    --        --                                            Citric Acid   --       --        2.900                                         Nonionic Surfactant                                                                          1.000    1.0000    1.000                                         Phenolphthalein                                                                              0.020    --        --                                            Sodium Citrate                                                                               --       --        0.010                                         Cetylpyridinium                                                                              --       0.0750    0.075                                         Chloride                                                                       Sodium Saccharin                                                                             0.035    0.0350    0.035                                         Flavor        0.250    0.2500    0.250                                         FDandamp;C Blue #1  --       0.0022    --                                            FDandamp;C Yellow #5                                                                               0.001    --        --                                            Disodium Hydrogen                                                                            --       0.0100    --                                            Phosphate                                                                      Monosodium Dihyrogen                                                                         --       0.0600    --                                            Phosphate                                                                                    100.000% 100.0000% 100.000%                                      ______________________________________                                     </TBL><PAR>  The pH of the red liquid was 10.0, the pH of the colorless liquid was 2.5,      and the pH of the blue liquid was 4.5.
