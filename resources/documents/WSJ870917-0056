TannenbaumStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 09/17/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> CRZY EMTENDER OFFERS, MERGERS, ACQUISITIONS (TNM)RETAILING (RET)TELECOMMUNICATIONS, BROADCASTING, TELEPHONE, TELEGRAPH (TEL) </IN><TEXT>   Fast-growing Entertainment Marketing Inc., while disclosing it will write down by about one-third the value of its holding in Crazy Eddie Inc., said it plans to &quot;protect&quot; its investment in the troubled electronics retailer.    The disclosure came in Entertainment Marketing's announcement that fiscal second-quarter profit rose 82%. The Houston-based electronics wholesaler also said it is considering selling its unprofitable television home-shopping subsidiary.    Entertainment Marketing said it will reduce on its balance sheet the value of its Crazy Eddie holdings to $8.1 million from $12.2 million. Elias Zinn, president, and the company together bought about 1.7 million shares earlier this year, but they later abandoned a bid to buy the rest of Crazy Eddie, a 41-store chain based in Edison, N.J., for about $233 million, or $8 a share.    The reduced value is based on Crazy Eddie's closing price of $5 a share on July 31. Since that date, the stock has fallen further. It closed yesterday in national over-the-counter trading at $4.625 a share, up 12.5 cents.    Mr. Zinn said yesterday that Entertainment Marketing shortly would announce a &quot;significant plan to protect its investment in Crazy Eddie.&quot;    In New York, one securities analyst believed this would be a proxy fight for control of Crazy Eddie, which Entertainment Marketing has threatened. He said such a move would be likely to succeed now that Eddie Antar, company founder, appears to be withdrawing from the company.    Late yesterday afternoon, in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Entertainment Marketing and Mr. Zinn said they might buy more Crazy Eddie shares, possibly exceeding the 20% level mentioned as a possibility in earlier filings. They also said they had discussed with unidentified third parties the possibility of a proxy battle.    But Entertainment Marketing hedged its filing with a note that it nevertheless might decide to sell the Crazy Eddie shares that it already owns.    Mr. Antar, meanwhile, completed the sale of nearly half his remaining shares in Crazy Eddie, touching off speculation that the retailer is increasingly vulnerable to a proxy contest.    In his own filing with the SEC yesterday, Mr. Antar said he had sold 1.4 million shares Tuesday for $4.375 each, an indicated total of $6.1 million before commissions. Before the sale, Mr. Antar owned almost 2.9 million shares, a 9.1% stake. The sale left him with fewer than 1.5 million shares, a 4.7% stake, he reported.    Separately, Entertainment Marketing said that it may sell its television home-shopping unit, Consumer Discount Network. The unit has had operating losses, which are continuing in the current quarter, depressing the parent's results.    The company has been approached about a possible sale of the home-shopping subsidiary, Mr. Zinn said, and an investment banker has been retained to advise the company on a possible transaction.    For the second quarter ended July 31, the company posted net income of $623,803, or five cents a share, including a one-time gain of $265,199. In the year-earlier period, net was $342,583, or three cents a share. Sales for the period more than doubled to a record $37.6 million from $14.9 million. Despite the problems with the home shopping unit, Entertainment Marketing said the company projects continued strong growth in its core business, distribution of discontinued electronic products. </TEXT></DOC>
