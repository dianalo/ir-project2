(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel Corp. probablywill remain profitable despite a downturn in the steel industrynext year, but there's no immediate end in sight to the company'sfederal bankruptcy status, shareholders were told Tuesday.   James L. Wareham, Wheeling-Pitt president and chief operatingofficer, blamed the expected downturn on lower steel pricesthroughout the industry.   ``Industry analysts have different views of how deep thedownturn will be and how long it will last,'' Wareham said duringthe company's annual stockholders meeting. ``We forecast arelatively short down cycle.''   William J. Scharffenberger, Wheeling-Pitt board chairman andchief executive officer, said legal constraints would prevent thesteelmaker from emerging from U.S. Bankruptcy Court protectionbefore June 1990. The company filed for Chapter 11 protection onApril 16, 1985.   Scharffenberger said several major factors remain to be settled,including a new labor agreement with the United Steelworkers ofAmerica, which he predicted will be forthcoming by January.   Scharffenberger and Wareham refused to comment on the labornegotiations, which continued Tuesday in Pittsburgh.   Union officials have said previously that they are interested inregaining some of the concessions made in the 1982 and 1985contracts.   Despite the expected downturn, Wareham said the company intendsto go ahead with about $100 million in improvements next year,including clean air projects at Martins Ferry, Ohio, clean waterprojects and upgrading of the 80-inch hot strip mill inSteubenville, Ohio, and an automatic gauge control at Allenport, Pa.</TEXT></DOC>
