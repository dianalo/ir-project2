The non-OPEC producers had agreed on cuts at a one-day meeting inLondon Feb. 21 but amounts were not disclosed.   The Middle East Economic Survey reported the six countries' andbarrel-per-day cuts are: Mexico 68,000; China 31,000; Oman 28,000;Egypt 24,000; North Yemen 20,000; and Malaysia 17,000.   ``However, a question mark still hangs over the biggest fish ofall _ the Soviet Union,'' the newsletter said. It said the USSR,with other countries, agreed to go back to its authorities todetermine its contribution to the cuts.   MEES said the Soviet Union told the London meeting it shared thephilosophy of cuts and ``might announce some measures next week.''   It said that Angola and Columbia, which were involved inexpansion plans, agreed to freeze exports at current levels and thatNorway is sticking to its previously announced OPEC-support policyof curbing production at 7.5 percent below originally plannedcapacity.   The non-OPEC producers cuts' are unconditional and not dependenton any reciprocal action by the 13 OPEC members who set newproduction ceilings last November to stem a fall in oil prices.</TEXT></DOC>
