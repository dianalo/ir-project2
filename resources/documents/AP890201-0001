The $45,500 pay raise _ a 51 percent hike _ will take effect nextWednesday unless both the Senate and House vote to block it.   Wright, D-Texas, plans to propose that the increase be scaledback to 30 percent, said the source, speaking on condition ofanonymity. A 30 percent raise would hike the current congressionalsalary from $89,500 by $26,850, to a total of $116,350.   Wright plans to seek a vote on approving the lower raise on Feb.9, The Washington Post reported in its Thursday editions.   Meanwhile, House members indicated in an Associated Press surveythat they want a vote on the sensitive issue.   Survey results put additional pressure on Wright to abandon acarefully orchestrated strategy of taking no vote until after theraise automatically takes effect next Wednesday.   Wright said Tuesday he would hold a vote if that was whatlawmakers wanted. The speaker announced he was circulating aquestionnaire privately to determine whether House members reallywanted a recorded vote. Wright's tally was not made availableWednesday.   However, an Associated Press informal survey of nearly a third ofthe 435 House members showed about 88 percent of those respondingwanted a vote on the pay raise.   Meanwhile, a survey of the entire House released Wednesday byopponents of the pay raise showed 62 percent saying they would vote``no'' if the issue came to a vote.   Under the law, members of Congress and other top federalofficials will get pay raises of about 50 percent on Feb. 8 unlessboth chambers reject it. Rank-and-file congressional salaries wouldgo from $89,500 to $135,000, under the recommendation submitted byformer President Reagan and supported by President Bush.   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, has promised avote in his chamber this week. Surveys show the pay raise would behandily rejected there.   House Democratic leaders, with Republican consent, had adopted astrategy of avoiding a vote until after the deadline and thensoftening the political blow of the substantial pay raise by passingnew ethics rules including a ban on lawmakers accepting speakingfees.   The strategy was based on the opinion that House memberssupported the raise but would find it politically impossible to votefor it.   Wright, who had been taking most of the political heat on theissue, changed that strategy on Tuesday. His survey was designed, inpart, to demonstrate that it was not Jim Wright alone who favoredthe pay increase.   ``Over the past several weeks, I have heard from many members onboth sides of the aisle. I have a pretty good idea of how theyfeel,'' Wright said. ``They support `regular procedure''' _ whichwould mean committee hearings and a legislative schedule that wouldmake a vote impossible before the Feb. 8 deadline.   But when asked if he would permit a vote should members surprisehim and demand one, Wright said, ``If the members want it, yes, ofcourse''   The Associated Press contacted 143 congressional offices andfound 92 members publicly supporting a recorded vote on the payraise. Only six said they were against it and seven were undecided.There was no response from 38 offices. It should be noted thatadvocates of the pay raise have been reluctant to publicly indicatetheir support, for fear of the political fallout.   Mark Johnson, Wright's spokesman, said it would be wrong to useany informal surveys to predict the results of the speaker's privatesurvey.   However, another top leadership aide, speaking on the conditionof anonymity, pointed out that the speaker's survey could compoundthe political problem if the results are at odds with those frommedia surveys.   Several lawmakers who were following the leadership strategy ofkeeping silent on the issue privately expressed aggravation at thespeaker's new tactic.   ``This is like a war in which the general says to take the hill,you turn around, and find the general's gone,'' said a Republicanmember who spoke on the condition of anonymity.   If a vote were scheduled, House members overwhelmingly wouldreject the pay increase, according to a survey released Wednesday byseveral groups opposed to the increase.   The survey said 270 House members, or about 62 percent, said theywould oppose the raise if it came to a vote. Forty-seven, or about11 percent, said they would support the raise; 75 members, about 17percent, declined to state a position, and 41 members, about 9percent, declined to respond.   The survey was conducted by Public Citizen, a consumer advocacygroup founded by Ralph Nader; the National Taxpayers Union, anon-partisan organization of fiscal conservatives; and Coalitionsfor America, a conservative organization headed by activist PaulWeyrich.   After the survey was released, Rep. Thomas Carper, R-Del., saidhe too was against the raise, even though the survey had listed himas undecided. Rep. Robert Roe, D-N.J., was also listed as undecided,but has been publicly opposed to the raise for more than a week.   ``A failure to vote on this issue would be a fundamentalbreakdown of democracy,'' said Joan Claybrook, president of PublicCitizen.   Senate opponents of the pay increase, at a hearing of the SenateGovernmental Affairs Committee, said the current system of allowingpay increases to take effect without a vote was hurting Congress'public image.   ``What must they think of us, when we run from accountability, ascockroaches run from bright light?'' said Sen. Gordon Humphrey,R-N.H.   Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C. told the committee that, ``People allover the United States are saying, `They're a bunch of crooks'.''   But committee member Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, said the raise wasneeded, especially for judges and federal officials.   ``What does it cost government to have incompetent people at thetop?'' Stevens asked.   With the future of the pay raise uncertain, House and Senatenegotiators were moving ahead Wednesday with their separate butsimilar efforts to draft ethics legislation to bar honoraria andrestrict other outside income.</TEXT></DOC>
