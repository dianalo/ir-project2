The assessment provides a basis forthe conclusion that the field testing of these genetically engineered alfalfaplants will not present a risk of introduction or dissemination of a plantpest and will not have any significant impact on the quality of the humanenvironment. Based upon this finding of no significant impact, the Animaland Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that an environmentalimpact statement need not be prepared. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>address: </T2>Copies of the environmental assessment and finding ofno significant impact are available for public inspection at Biotechnology,Biologics, and Environmental Protection, Animal and Plant Health InspectionService, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Room 850, Federal Building, 6505Belcrest Road, Hyattsville, MD, between 8 a.m. and 4:30 p.m., Monday throughFriday, except holidays. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>for further information contact: </T2>Dr. Quentin B.

A permit must be obtained before a regulated article may beintroduced in the United States. The regulations set forth procedures forobtaining a limited permit for the importation or interstate movement ofa regulated article and for obtaining a permit for the release into theenvironment of a regulated article. The Animal and Plant Health InspectionService (APHIS) has stated that it would prepare an environmental assessmentand, when necessary, an environmental impact statement before issuing apermit for the release into the environment of a regulated article (see52 FR 22906). Pioneer Hi-Bred International, Inc. of Johnston, Iowa, has submitted anapplication for a permit for release into the environment, to field testalfalfa plants genetically engineered to express a gene that provides resistanceto alfalfa mosaic virus. The field trial will take place in Johnston, Iowa.In the course of reviewing the permit application, APHIS assessed the impacton the environment of releasing the alfalfa plants under the conditionsdescribed in the Pioneer Hi-Bred International, Inc., application. APHISconcluded that the field testing will not present a risk of plant pestintroduction or dissemination and will not have any significant impacton the quality of the human environment. The environmental assessment and finding of no significant impact, whichare based on data submitted by Pioneer Hi-Bred International, Inc., aswell as a review of other relevant literature, provide the public withdocumentation of APHIS' review and analysis of the environmental impactsassociated with conducting the field testing. The facts supporting APHIS' finding of no significant impact are summarizedbelow and are contained in the environmental assessment. 1. The virus coat protein gene of alfalfa mosaic virus strain 425 Madisonhas been inserted into an alfalfa chromosome. The expression of this geneprovides resistance to alfalfa mosaic virus. In nature, genetic materialcontained in a chromosome of these plants is transferred to another sexuallycompatible plant by cross-pollination. In this field trial, no introducedgene can spread to another plant by cross-pollination, because the geneticallyengineered alfalfa plants will be mowed to prevent flower formation. Thus,no pollen will be produced by any alfalfa plant in this experiment. 2. Neither the coat protein gene itself, nor its gene product, conferson alfalfa any plant pest characteristic. 3. The vector used to transfer the coat protein gene to alfalfa plant cellshas been evaluated for its use in this specific experiment and does notpose a plant pest risk in this experiment. The vector, although derivedfrom the DNA of a tumor inducing (Ti) plasmid with known plant pathogenicpotential, has been disarmed; that is, genes that are necessary for pathogenicityhave been removed from the vector. The vector has been tested and shownnot to be pathogenic to any susceptible plant. 4. The vector agent <T3>Agrobacterium tumefaciens, </T3>a phytopathogenic bacterium, was usedto deliver the vector DNA and the coat protein gene into alfalfa plantcells. The vector agent has been chemotherapeutically eliminated and shownby <T3>in vitro </T3>and <T3>in vivo </T3>assays to be no longer associated with any regeneratedalfalfa plant. 5. Horizontal movement or gene transfer of the coat protein gene is notpossible. The vector acts by delivering and inserting the gene into analfalfa chromosome (i.e., chromosomal DNA). The vector does not survivein or on any transformed plant to any other organism. 6. The size of the field test plot is small and will be located on a privateresearch farm in a rural area which will provide good security. The environmental assessment and finding of no significant impact havebeen prepared in accordance with: (1) The National Environmental PolicyAct of 1969 (NEPA) (42 U.S.C. 4331 <T3>et seq.</T3>), (2) Regulations of the Council on Environmental Qualityfor Implementing the Procedural Provisions of NEPA (40 CFR parts 1500-1509),(3) USDA Regulations Implementing NEPA (7 CFR part 1b), and (4) APHIS GuidelinesImplementing NEPA (44 FR 50381-50384, August 28, 1979, and 44 FR 51272-51274,August 31, 1979).<ITAG tagnum="21">Done in Washington, DC, this 19th day of September 1989. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">James W.
