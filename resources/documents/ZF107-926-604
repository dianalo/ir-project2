 We have a long way togo, and I'm thrilled to be part of the effort to usher the Army totally intothe information age.andP;  Without doubt, my biggest challenge will be to securethe resources we need.andM;We'll stay at home when the budget fights are going on.andP;  We'll articulate theArmy's position, do our bit around the program budget committees, get ourhomework done, present our case on the various panels and committees and giveit our best shot.andM;GCN: Are there good communications lines from the Army's upper ADP managementto the Hill?andM;HILMES:  I really can't comment because I was busy in operational testing inthe past few years.andP;  Since I've been in this job, I've worked very closelywith the liaison people to set up courtesy calls and start to lay thegroundwork for improving communications.andP;  Obviously, we've got someperceptions to turn around.andP;  I don't think we're as bad as some of thesereports say we are, although we've got a lot of work to do.andM;GCN:  As an engineer, what do you think you can bring to the Office of theDirector of Information Systems for Command, Control, Communications andComputers (DISC4)?andM;HILMES:  Well, I think a good engineer can do anything.andP;  I think it's becausethey have a systems approach.andP;  My secondary specialty is systems analysis.andO;[But] by the time you hit field-grade officer in the Army, you're not doingthat much technical stuff anyhow; you're exercising your management andleadership skills.andP;  So it's kind of a three-dimensional thing.andP;  While I'lladmit I may be a little short in this specific technology, I think I canbring a fresh look to the other two dimensions.andM;GCN: How is your work in the Army Operational Test Evaluation Agency (OTEA)related to DISC4?andM;HILMES:  The OTEA operationally tests and evaluates all Army systems.andP;  TheDISC4 systems are one of the functional areas.andP;  In OTEA, we tested andevaluated not only DISC4 systems but also artillery and other fire supportsystems, air defense systems, combat support systems, the various battlefieldfunctional areas.andP;  It just so happened during my time at OTEA that we did alot of DISC4 systems.andM;GCN:  Is that why you were selected?andM;HILMES:  Well, not the primary reason, but I'm sure it didn't hurt.andP;  Itprobably was a combination of general experience across the Army, variousbattlefield areas, the business side of the Army, acquiring things,facilities, my track record, the scientific background.andM;GCN:  You advocate total quality management (TQM).andP;  What exactly is that andhow do you apply it to Army information systems?andM;HILMES:  To me, it is a philosophy of getting things done consistent withgood basic leadership and good business practices.andM;When I got into it at OTEA, I found we were practicing many of the principlesof TQM, but there were some new aspects I hand't incorporated before, such asempowering everybody in the organization to stop the process they're involvedin if they can't do a first-class, quality job.andM;We accepted that principle and started trying to institutionalize itthroughout the agency.andP;  It basically involves creating an environment wherepeople have the resources to do the quality job, so things get done right thefirst time.andM;Lots easier said than done, but it rests on the precept that everybody in theorganization is trying to do a good job.andP;  All you can do is enhance theirchances and let your organization know you're very receptive to anysuggestions to remove obstacles or to eliminate counterproductive processes.andM;There's also a very disciplined, methodological approach that is part of TQM,whereby you examine each process in the organization and see if some of themcan be combined, streamlined or eliminated.andP;  Implicit in that is your abilityto measure the output of these processes to see if you're improving or not.andM;You may be making great progress right now.andP;  It doesn't mean you let thatride.andP;  You come back and look at it from time to time and see where you couldstill improve without getting all hung up on examining each and every processand measuring the output of every process.andP;  I call that examining your navel.andO;If you examine your navel too long, you'll get a stiff neck.andM;GCN:  What do you see as DISC4's most important initiatives?andM;HILMES: We have had a lot of reports and investigations.andP;  Corrective actionsneed to be taken.andP;  We have to try to organize for combat, so to speak, andtake on these management areas.andM;We developed a strategy of how we were going to modernize the Army'ssustained base in the information management area.andM;First of all, you have to have the architecture, how all these informationelements are goind to interrelate.andP;  That makes it easy to decide how you'regoing to acquire systems compatible with that architecture.andP;  It takes a lotof work and people.andM;One of the initiatives is to improve the professional development of ourcivil service and military people so that we have career ladders and otherbenefits to compensate for relatively low pay compared to industry.andM;I don't think civil servants stay for pay alone, because they can usuallymake a lot more in the private sector.andP;  But they stay for other reasons, sowe want to build on those othe reasons.andP;  We need development programs so theycan have a meaningful career in the Army and advance to top positions.andM;Another important aspect of this strategy is to use the chain of command.andO;We've got [personnel] out there perfectly capable of managing programs if theguidance is clearly stated.andP;  We've incorporated some sample thresholds,ceilings and fiscal guidance into our new life cycle management.andP;  We tried touse the TQM principle that everybody's involved, so let's get everybody'sparticipation and cooperation.andM;I think people stay in [government] if they perceive where they fit into thebig picture.andP;  So that should be clearly stated in the organization andfunction of the agencies.andM;If job description, performance standards and those sorts of things are notclear, I think it is incumbent upon you to ensure that it's clear.andM;We get some great people that could make five times as much in the privatesector, but they know what they're working on is challenging and important.andO;I've run into those people a lot over the last 10 years when I've worked withmore civil servants.andP;  There are a lot of good, dedicated civil servants outthere that work just as hard as anyone you'd ever meet.andM;Recognition doesn't always have to be money.andP;  We can give out civilianservice medals, everything from a note that says, &quot;Good job.andP;  Keep it up,&quot; tothe highest decoration.andP;  Everybody likes to be stroked and know that he orshe is doing a great job.andM;GCN: What does the new report by the House Appropriations Committee's Surveysand Investigations staff say, and how will you respond?andM;HILMES:  The report consisted mainly, I would say, of criticism of the Army'smanagement of the information mission area.andP;  Basically, it alleged that theArmy wasn't in control of things.andP;  We haven't really received a reportofficially, so at this point I have no formal response, but I suspect thatthe same things will come up the next time we testify for the budget.andM;My though is to convince the committee that the field [organization] as wellas headquarters has a very structured approach, that we review at certainlevels of program cost, that we have a disciplined requirements process thatgoes clear up to headquarters for a requirements sanity check and anarchitecture configuration check before it can go back down as an approvedrequirement and get rolled up into a program.andM;GCN: Do you foresee a lot of programs being cut or unfunded for the comingyear?andM;HILMES: The kinds of cuts we're talking about right now are significant.andO;They're going to cause some rifts.andP;  They will certainly delay and stretch outdeveloping programs and could even cause a cutback in some services weprovide now.andP;  Our first priority would be to continue to operate thosesystems we have out there supporting the troops before we put a lot of moneyinto upgrades.andM;GCN: Will you be cutting down on the number of new programs you initiate?andM;HILMES: That's a possibility.andP;  I would certainly hate to see that because newautomated programs essentially save us money in the long run, save us people.andO;So we're just delaying the benefits if we have to stretch them out.andM;GCN: Do you think things will improve, stay the same or get worse in the nextyear or two?andM;HILMES: Oh, I'm not an incurable optimist.andP;  I think realistically you'll seethe information mission area continue to expand and improve.andP;  Even though theprojections predict level funding, I think you'll see more funds going intothe information mission area because commanders everywhere are seeing this asa way out of their dilemma of not having enough resources to do the job.andM;Instead of carrying technical manuals into the field, you'll carry theinformation on your computer.andP;  As we get a little further along on sharesdatabases, [we'll have] one-stop processing where the new soldier can inputhis name, rank and serial number an everybody gets it from the surgeon to thequarters assignment people to finance and personnel.andP;  The efficiencies willjust cause the demand to increase.andM;So it's important to us to have the architecture clearly laid out as wecontinue to acquire more ADP, so we can share data, talk to one another.andP;  Ifwe're overloaded here, another machine can pick it up over there.andM;Right now, we have a lot of Standard Army Management Information Systems onour big networks and at the local installations and community level.andP;  Youhave to figure out how you're going to access these standard systems to pullout data you need to do your job.andM;We have one program, ISM, Installation Support Module, where we have figuredthat out for them.andP;  If they need to access SIDPERS they can get up on a netand say, &quot;Hey, do we have this capability somplace?&quot;andP;  There's no need forthem to reinvent the wheel if we can eliminate duplication.andM;Give them the application they're looking for.andP;  It may be 80 percent of whatthey want, and they can get on with business.andP;  That's kind of the cornerstoneof our whole strategy -- a bottoms-up approach.andP;  The smart people are outthere in the units and in the installations.andP;  They're the people who aredoing the work.andP;  It's our responsibility to make it as easy as possible forthem.andM;Lt.andP;  Gen.andP;  Jerome B. Hilmes, the new director of information systems forcommand, control, communications and computers, came to the Army's DISC4Office in October after serving as commanding general of the Army OperationalTest and Evaluation Agency in Alexandria, Va.andM;A West Point graduate, Hilmes has more than 30 years of active commissionedservice.andM;Hilmes holds a doctorate in civil engineering from Iowa State University.andM;He served in Vietnam and more recently commanded Army Engineer Divisions inIllinois and Texas.andP;  His decorations include the Distinguished Service Medal,Legion of Merit and Bronze Star.andM;GCN staff writer Brad Bass interviewed Hilmes at the Pentagon.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
