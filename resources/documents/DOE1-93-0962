The fact of critical anomaly existence in the ultrasoundabsorption anisotropy in a wide temperature range in the crystals cubicparaphase is ascertained. It is shown that in KTaO/sub 3/ : Li crystalsuch anisotropy is related to considerable difference between order parameterbond constants and deformation. For SrTiO/sub 3/ crystals absorptionanisotropy is realized in the absence of strong bond anisotropy and itoriginated due to strongly anisotropic quasitwo-dimensional characterof order parameter fluctuations.</TEXT></DOC>
