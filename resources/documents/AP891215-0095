A brief statement said the concern was based partly on recentreports of movement of terrorists from the Middle East and thediscovery of weapons shipments destined for pro-Iranian groups inSpain and Africa.   ``If credible, specific information or a threat to the public isreceived, the Department of State will provide additionalinformation for travelers and other concerned parties,'' thestatement said.   A State Department official, who asked not to be identified,said the administration has begun briefing foreign governmentsabout its concerns and felt that a warning to the public also wasappropriate.   One reason for increased fears of terrorist attack, the officialsaid, is the seizure of 440 pounds of explosives Nov. 23 inValencia, Spain, and the arrest of eight suspected Shiite Moslemextremists by Spanish police.   A French police report said the men and explosives were headedfor France. According to Spanish police, at least three of the menare members of Hezbollah, an Iran-backed group of extremist Shiitesbased in Lebanon.   The official also said there are several anniversaries coming upthat terrorists sometimes use as occasions for carrying out violentactivities.   One was the still unresolved bombing of Pan Am flight 103 onDec. 21, 1988 over Lockerbie, Scotland, with a death toll of 259aboard the craft and 11 on the ground.   According to investigators, evidence points to the Popular Frontfor the Liberation of Palestine-General Command as the responsiblegroup.   Another December incident was the terrorist attacks on airportsin Rome and Vienna two days after Christmas in 1985.   The official said they also are wary because the number ofAmericans in Europe increases sharply during the Christmas season.   Today's advisory contained scant information, but it followed aseries of precautionary steps by the French government to guardagainst the possibility of terrorist attacks during the holidayseason.   Interior and justice ministers from the European Community weremeeting in France on Thursday and today to coordinate efforts totrack down a Shiite militant group reportedly responsible for themovement of explosives from Spain and to France and Cyprus as well.   Some French officials believe the principal aim of the group maybe to try to dissuade France from from opposing an assault inLebanon on the Christian forces of Gen. Michel Auon by a pro-SyrianMuslim coalition.   The French action also coincides with the impending trial of oneaccused terrorist charged in bombing incidents and a hunger strikeby a convicted terrorist who is serving a life term for trying tokill former Iranian Prime Minister Shahpour Bakhtiar.   In the latter case, involving the conviction of Anis Naccache,the Iranian government has repeatedly demanded that he be released.</TEXT></DOC>
