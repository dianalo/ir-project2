At a closed meeting of the General Agreement on Tariffs andTrade, the United States was also criticized for refusing to accepta ruling against U.S. patent law, but won praise for agreeing toease restrictions on imports of sugar, a GATT official said oncondition of anonymity.   At the meeting the European Economic Community and Norway bothaccepted GATT rulings that they should allow freer access to importsof fruit, the official said.   The GATT council meeting also received a formal bid formembership from Venezuela, the only sizable Latin American countrynot in the 96-nation trade group, and heard an announcement byAustria that it would slash import taxes on nearly 2,000 products,the official said.   Brazilian ambassador Rubens Ricupero told the closed session thatthe U.S. threat to impose tariffs of up to 100 percent on someBrazilian goods ``places under threat the entire Brazilian exportsector,'' according to a text of his speech released to journalists.   Indian delegate Bal Krishan Zutshi said it would be ``extremelydifficult'' to yield to U.S. demands for direct talks about thetrade barriers under ``threat of unilateral retaliation.''   A U.S. deputy trade representative, Rufus Yerxa, told the meetingU.S. action was justified and added the Bush administration wasprepared to pursue its grievances within the GATT multilateralsystem of rules, according to the GATT official who was present atthe meeting.   Under a controversial section of its 1988 trade act, the UnitedStates last month announced priority action against Brazil forimport quotas, against India for restrictions on foreign investmentand against Japan for refusing to buy U.S. superconductors andsatellites.   It has said the three countries must agree to negotiations andremove the offending barriers within 18 months or face retaliatorytariffs.   More than 20 countries have criticized U.S. policy at GATTmeetings Wednesday and Thursday, the official said.   The United States was also criticized by several negotiators forrefusing to accept a GATT dispute panel ruling against U.S. patentlaw, the official said.   In a case raised by the EEC, the panel found that the UnitedStates dealt more harshly with foreign products challenged withinfringing U.S. patents than with home-produced goods similarlychallenged.   Yerxa said he saw ``no existing means of reconciling the adoptionof the report with U.S. political and commercial interests,''according to the GATT official.   The United States has now blocked adoption of the report at fivecouncil meetings.   However, Yerxa said the United States accepted the findings of areport that its quota on sugar imports violated free trade rules andsaid the Bush administration would be considering how to ease therestrictions.   The EEC for its part said it accepted a dispute panel ruling thatit must reform its controls on imports of dessert apples followingcomplaints from both the United States and Chile.   Norway agreed to adopt a judgment that it should not restrictimports of apples and pears into the country, the official said.   Venezuela's application to join the GATT is significant becauseit also belongs to the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countriescartel, which has the opposite aims of GATT in that it seeks tocontrol oil trade and prices.   There are now 10 countries, including China, waiting to join GATT.</TEXT></DOC>
