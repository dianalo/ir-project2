The well known gel precipitationprocess was modified for the manufacture of UO/sub 2/ cores. 2. The TRISOcoating (additional SiC layer between two very dense PyC layers) canbe applied with the required quality on an economical 10 kg scale. 3.The particle fracture in the complete fuel element due to manufacturewas lowered during the course of the project to below the target valuesof andless;60x10/sup -6/ U/U total. For testing fuel elements, the requiredirradiation samples were designed in agreement with the reactor constructors,were prepared and the first phase of the irradiation program was successfullycompleted in the context of the HBK project.</TEXT></DOC>
