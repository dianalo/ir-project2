Democracy Wall, so named because it was laden with posterscalling for democratic reform, came to represent the earlypolitical dissent that was crushed by Deng Xiaoping, China'ssupreme leader.   The political tremors of 10 years ago presaged the currentupheaval by millions of student-led protesters, but there are majordifferences between the so-called Beijing Spring of 1979 and thatof 1989.   The movement then was mostly underground and disorganized andinvolved a few thousand people, mostly working-class men. It wasfar more strident and revolutionary than the past six weeks ofjubilant demonstrations in Beijing.   Then, there were no live television interviews with loquacious,hopeful demonstrators in Western clothes. There were no rockconcerts.   In December, 1978 the United States and China restoreddiplomatic relations. The next year witnessed the flowering and theend of the Democracy Wall, in the same central square where today'sstudents have centered their protests.   Ten years ago, the movement was fierce in rhetoric, morenegative than positive. Many dissidents likened Communism tofascism and denounced Deng as a modern emperor and tyrant. Theydidn't know exactly what they wanted, or how to get it, but theyknew they didn't want the status quo.   ``We don't want Communism, socialism, capitalism or any other`ism' _ we want nationalism and the best for China,'' dissidentssaid.   They were branded as counterrevolutionaries out to wreck Chinesemodernization.   In 1979 it took a special courage to stand up to the powerfulstate machinery that did not tolerate criticism. Ordinary citizenswere afraid to speak out in support of the demonstrators, posterwriters, artists and poets who clamored for change.   Many were afraid to speak to foreigners, because they might beinterrogated by police.   In demonstrations, police did not hesitate to disperse crowdsusing force. Some who dared speak out were beaten and jailed, somelost their jobs.   One editor of an underground magazine, Wei Jingsheng, was triedand convicted as a traitor in 1979. He was sentenced to 15 years ina labor camp, where some say he went mad and died.   But all that was before sweeping economic reforms gave peoplegreater independence and confidence, before glasnost and greaterfreedom began to sweep the Communist world.   Now, millions of people nationwide have defied the governmentand martial law with marches and demands for democracy, partyreform and an end to endemic official corruption.   Demonstrators have demanded the ouster of Deng and his hard-lineprotege, Premier Li Peng. They have shouted, chanted, and theyblocked army tanks when Li declared martial law.   About 3,000 went on a hunger strike.   Though today's protest leaders face danger, there is officialrecognition of legitimate demands for greater freedom.   The men and women today are disciplined and organized, and moreimportant, they are backed by ordinary citizens. Their strengthlies in numbers, mass support, reasonable demands for reform and aclean Communist government. They don't demand revolution.   Even the government calls most of them patriots.   The student demands have been treated sympathetically by theofficial Chinese press, which has even joined the protests.   Democracy Wall, a gray stone barricade between a bus yard andcentral Tiananmen Square, was the focus of the movement 10 yearsago, when China was emerging from the Cultural Revolution andbeginning to open to the outside world.   The wall, 200 yards long and three yards high, became abillboard for big character posters, a staging ground for activism,a gallery for dissident artists, and a marketplace for ideas andunofficial magazines.   It made headlines in November 1978 when Deng exploited it todiscredit political opponents who banished him during the CulturalRevolution. Deng himself reportedly named it ``Democracy Wall.''   ``Wall posters are not forbidden ... they are a constitutionalright and if the masses feel some anger, we must let them expressit,'' Deng said in late 1978.   But he also said the masses sometimes were confused.   Then, Deng, the architect of China's economic reforms and opendoor, decided that free speech had gone too far.   On Dec. 7, 1979, big character posters were prohibited. Workersused scrapers, shovels, rakes, brooms, spatulas, steel wool anderadicated the offending posters _ but not the ideas.</TEXT></DOC>
