TaylorStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 07/31/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> PNH LILNUCLEAR POWER, FUEL (NUK)UTILITIES (UTI)CONGRESS (CNG) </IN><DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   In a victory for the nuclear power industry, the House beat back several amendments from industry critics and overwhelmingly approved a $7 billion cap on nuclear power-plant liability.    In two days on the House floor, the legislation's backers soundly defeated all attempts to amend the compromise bill. That is expected to strengthen the hand of the nuclear industry and the Reagan administration in Senate action on a similar bill. The Senate Environment Committee is expected to begin work on a bill Tuesday.    The House action also bodes ill for an expected effort next week by Rep. Edward Markey (D., Mass.) to buttress a barrier against operating licenses for the controversial Seabrook and Shoreham nuclear plants.    &quot;We got beat up pretty badly,&quot; said Kathleen Welch, a lobbyist for the U.S. Public Interest Research Group and other nuclear critics. &quot;They went right down the line with the nuclear industry.&quot;    The compromise bill, approved 396-17, would raise the Price-Anderson Act's nuclear-plant liability limit to about $7 billion from the current $705 million. While the new level would be far more than the $2 billion limit sought by the nuclear industry last year, nuclear critics wanted liability to be unlimited.    The measure would extend the liability cap to cover new plants ordered in the next 10 years. The current law will continue covering all nuclear plants currently operating or under construction until a new law is enacted, but won't cover newly ordered plants.    After defeats Wednesday, nuclear critics brought only one amendment to a recorded vote yesterday. Rep. Gerry Sikorski (D., Minn.) failed by a 230-183 vote to prevent utilities and insurers from using the bill's insurance pool to pay for legal expenses.    Rep. Sikorski argued that if accident claims exceeded the $7 billion cap, lawyers screening or opposing claims would be fully paid while victims might have to settle for a fraction of their claims.    Rep. Carlos Moorhead (D., Calif.) replied that without the scrutiny of claims, deserving victims might lose benefits as frivolous claims were paid off. Some lawmakers even suggested that victims' legal fees might be barred by the amendment.    Rep. Markey, an outspoken opponent of nuclear power, withheld an expected amendment to make nuclear-plant builders and suppliers liable in an accident for gross negligence or willful misconduct.    His staff said he was concentrating his energy on an amendment he expects to offer Tuesday to a bill reauthorizing the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. The amendment would prevent a proposed NRC rule change from helping the Shoreham and Seabrook plants qualify for operating licenses.    Seabrook is owned by a group of companies led by Public Service Co. of New Hampshire. Shoreham is owned and operated by Long Island Lighting Co. Both plants are essentially complete, but their licensing is impeded by refusals by the states of Massachusetts and New York, respectively, to cooperate in emergency planning.    Current NRC rules require plants to show &quot;that adequate protective measures will be taken in the event of an accident,&quot; which is difficult if states don't cooperate. The NRC is considering an exemption for plants that try to obtain cooperation, compensate for its absence and provide copies of their plans to the recalcitrant governments.    Rep. Markey said yesterday that all seven Democratic candidates for president endorsed his amendment in a letter to House Democrats. Yet Ms. Welch said that after watching the House this week, she and other nuclear critics were &quot;taking bets over too many beers on what it (the Markey amendment) would lose by.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
