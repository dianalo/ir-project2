SullivanandM;The once-faltering market for touch-screen monitors is now rebounding, as newtechnology and a broader range of applications attract new users.andM;Screen improvements have provided clearer resolution and better resilience tophysical abuse, while programming modifications mean that public systems areless likely to crash.andM;The rapid expansion of commercial applications is moving touch-screens beyondthe traditional stronghold of the factory floor.andP;  Non-industrial users arebeginning to realize the primary benefit of touch-screen technology: Itoffers an accessible interface that welcomes new users and minimizestraining.andM;Developers of interactive imaging systems agree that touch-screens easeaccess to the computer.andP;  To users, it often &quot;does not appear that a computeris involved at all,&quot; said Steve Gregory, president of the New EnglandTechnology Group Inc., a Cambridge, Mass., systems integrator.andM;Eliminating the keyboard also soothes many users' anxieties and eliminatesthe need to memorize commands, developers agreed.andP;  &quot;When someone is presentedwith a keyboard, it's frightening,&quot; said Vic Nightscales, vice president ofmanufacturing at Squirrel Companies Inc. in Vancouver, British Columbia,which manufactures LAN-based order-taking systems for restaurants.andP;  In suchenvironments, touch-screens can save on training, he said.andM;However, despite recent progress, touch-screens still lag behind thekeyboard, mouse and keypad as the preferred input device among power users,according to studies conducted by Andrew Chatha, president of AutomationResearch Corp., a Medfield, Mass., market-research firm.andM;Factory automation and machinery control remain strong markets fortouch-screen technology, according to Phil Huber, software director atWonderware Software Development Corp. in Irvine, Calif.andP;  His company'sInTouch development software supports Microsoft Corp.'s Windows interface asa front end for process-control applications.andP;  &quot;We don't have to sell anyoneon touch-screens,&quot; he said.andM;Entering New ArenasandM;Still, a host of new applications are moving the touch-screen market into avariety of new fields, including medicine.andP;  &quot;Hospitals needed a solution thatwould help them improve productivity and reduce training,&quot; explained Mary LuLander, director of industry relations for Unisys Corp., a computermanufacturer in Charlotte, N.C.andP;  By adding touch to its Professional ResourceNetwork for hospitals, &quot;[Unisys is] bringing the system closer to the enduser,&quot; Lander claimed.andM;The University of Chicago Hospital is expected to be among the first tointegrate the new Unisys Ntouch terminal; it plans to implement thetechnology this month.andP;  The terminals incorporate touch-screens made byMicroTouch Systems Inc. of Woburn, Mass., and will give employees access topatients' records at the touch of a finger.andM;Russian citizens, meanwhile, recently received hands-on exposure to anothernew use of touch technology at the Design USA cultural exposition held inMoscow last month, which displayed uses of high technology in designapplications.andM;An exhibit equipped with applications developed by New England TechnologyGroup combined video-disk-based graphics and touch-screens to letparticipants design their own chairs and rotate them in 3-D.andP;  Moscovites werealso invited to view samples of American housing by selecting criteria suchas price and region through the use of a touch-screen.andM;Touch-screens are also making inroads as front ends to central informationsystems.andP;  The Ford Motor Co. in Detroit, for example, uses touch-screen PCswith Easel-based applications to request parts and access programs on itsmainframes.andP;  Easel is a graphical-interface development tool from InteractiveImages Inc. of Woburn, Mass.andM;Another user of Easel software, Federal Express Corp. in Memphis, Tenn.,andO;combines the interface with touch-screens manufactured by Elographics Inc.andO;Conveyor belts that move packages through the overnight courier'spackage-distribution center are monitored and controlled through thetouch-screen consoles, said Blaine Robertson, project engineer for the firm.andM;Even the easy-to-use Squirrel restaurant system can link to a centraldatabase to connect waiters' orders with information on inventory, pricingand costs.andM;Future applications promise to use touch-screen technology to integratedisparate systems even further.andM;In February 1990, for instance, the Library of Congress will unveil itsEasel-based touch-screen retrieval system.andP;  Users of the new Access Systemwill be able to search for books by combining queries based on author names,titles and subjects, explained Susan Thomas, a systems analyst at theLibrary.andP;  The Access System will draw upon data in two mainframe-basedinformation-retrieval systems.andP;  &quot;We decided to put a touch-screen front endon that,&quot; said Thomas, &quot;so you don't have to learn either system.&quot;andM;Accompanying these new applications are significant technological changes.andM;Software developers have learned the hard way that &quot;people will play with thedevice,&quot; said Jim Peters, a member of IBM's development team for theInfoWindow multimedia development system.andP;  &quot;You have to allow for that[physical abuse] in the software programming.&quot;andM;Physical improvements are also credited with advancing touch capabilities.andM;Elographics, for example, acquired the rights to surface acoustic-wave (SAW)technology from Zenith Data Systems, and has incorporated it into itstouch-screen product line.andP;  Unlike earlier touch methods, SAW provides for aZ axis, allowing users to elicit additional responses by exerting morepressure on the screen.andP;  For example, a user scrolling through a list ofnames could speed the review by pushing harder on the screen, said MichaelHigginbotham, marketing manager for Elographics in Oak Ridge, Tenn.andM;SAW technology's use of clear glass, instead of a filtered plastic, alsoincreases a screen's clarity, said Chuck Roesslar, national distributionmanager at Aydin Corp., a monitor maker in Fort Washington, Pa.andP;  Aydindisplays can be equipped with touch-screens from Carroll Touch Inc. orMicroTouch Systems, as well as those based on SAW by Elographics, he said.andM;The display used in IBM's InfoWindow system also improves upon traditionalsoft-membrane touch-screens by adding a proprietary tempered glass that ismore durable, said IBM's Peters.andM;The shipment of the first two laptops to incorporate touch-screen technologyas a standard component marks the emergence of a new market for theeasy-to-use monitors.andM;Although both the hand-held Agilis system and the 17-pound Dynabook targetusers whose jobs take them outside the office, the two products differgreatly in scope.andM;The modular Agilis system, produced by Agilis Corp., of Mountain View,Calif., can be equipped with either an 8088 or a 386 microprocessor.andP;  Thesystem became available last month, and, depending on the configuration,sells for prices that range from $2,000 to $20,000.andM;Unlike Dynabook, which appears to be slated for office-bound workers atremote locations, Agilis is geared to those who work in the field.andM;&quot;Agilis is definitely for a new segment of the market,&quot; said FrancesMendelsohn, program manager for microcomputer strategy at market researcherInternational Data Corp., in Vienna, Va.andM;A weather-resistant system, Agilis also supports wireless networking overbroadband radio through a built-in Ethernet bus.andM;In addition, Agilis modules offer the option of packet radio communications.andO;Other features include multiple battery packs, Enhanced Graphics Adaptergraphics and a 20M-byte 2-1/2-inch hard disk from PrairieTek Corp. ofLongmont, Colo.andM;Agilis also offers users a single key with which to access on-screen keyboardemulation, as well as an optional keypad.andP;  Dynabook, on the other hand, sellsonly touch-screen technology.andP;  Its screen relies on surface acoustic-wavetouch-screen technology developed by Elographics Inc., of Oak Ridge, Tenn.andM;Fast Access via CD ROMandM;Dynabook, from Scenario Inc., of Somerville, Mass., is designed to providerapid access to vast amounts of information via a built-in CD ROM drive.andP;  Itis based on a 286 microprocessor and costs $4,995.andM;Dynabook's CD ROM drive makes the computer especially useful to auditors,salespeople and others who need to access large amounts of data quickly.andM;One new user of the laptop is Touche Ross andamp; Co., a New York accounting firm.andO;Touche is transferring all of its accounting literature to CD ROM to be usedby its auditors in the field, according to Chick Hawsey, who works as aconsultant for Touche Ross.andM;&quot;We're interested in touch-screens,&quot; Hawsey said, &quot;so that people who areabsolutely computer-illiterate can immediately begin using the informationsystem.&quot; -- K.S.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
