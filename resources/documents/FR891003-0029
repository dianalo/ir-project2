Adams, Assistant ChiefCounsel, Bureau of the Public Debt, Parkersburg, West Virginia 26106-1328.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>The Regional Delivery System (RDS)is a program developed by the Bureau of the Public Debt to automate theinscription; and provide for the delivery of Series EE savings bonds soldover-the-counter and through Bond-a-Month plans. When the Regional DeliverySystem is fully operational in all Federal Reserve Districts, most issuingagents heretofore qualified to sell and inscribe over-the-counter bondswill no longer conduct all phases of such transactions. They will continueto accept purchase orders and payments from customers, but will not inscribethe bonds. Instead, they will transmit funds and purchase order informationto designated Federal Reserve Banks that will inscribe the bonds in anautomated environment. Special arrangements will be made for large-volumeissuing agents, where authorized by the Bureau, to inscribe bonds soldover-the-counter and report sales on magnetic tape.Issuing agents that are not yet authorized RDS participants and agentsthat are authorized to inscribe bonds sold over-the-counter and reportsuch sales on magnetic tape, will continue to inscribe and deliver bonds.An audit by the Inspector General's Office and a study conducted by theSavings Bond Operations Office of its Cash Remittance/Interest AssessmentSystem resulted in recommendations to modify agent reporting requirements,thereby necessitating revisions of the regulations prior to implementation.These changes relate to issuing agent remittance requirements and the submissionof savings bond registration records. One change, in particular, shouldbe noted with respect to Treasury Tax and Loan Accounts. As a result ofthe study, credits to Treasury Tax and Loan Accounts may no longer be usedfor savings bond sales payments. The provision has therefore been eliminatedfrom andSection; 317.2(f).In the past several years, there has been a substantial change in the investmentpatterns of bondholders. As bonds became more competitive and appealingto investors, issuing agents began experiencing individual sales at faceamounts of $30,000 or more. Investors can use different inscriptions topurchase bonds in excess of $30,000 face amounts. Many monthly agents arenow occasionally holding large sums of sales proceeds until their scheduledremittance date.The revisions will both clarify and strengthen the requirements for agentsubmission of sales proceeds. They will further enhance the Department'scash management program by requiring agents to submit accumulations ofsales proceeds of $5,000 or more prior to their scheduled remittance. The changes will also include correction of an oversight in the currentregulations which resulted in the omission of instructions for remittingbond registration stubs. Issuing agents will now be required to submitbond registration records (stubs or tape) within 30 days following themonth of issue. This will facilitate reconciliation of agent activity inan earlier time frame.<ITAG tagnum="84">Procedural Requirements</ITAG>Because this final rule relates to public contracts, the notice and publiccomment and delayed effective date provisions of the Administrative procedureAct are inapplicable pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553(a)(2). This final rule isnot a ``major rule'' as defined in executive Order 12291, ``Federal Regulations''.A regulatory impact analysis is, therefore, not required. Because no noticeof proposed rulemaking is required, the provisions of the Regulatory FlexibilityAct do not apply.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 31 CFR Parts 352, 353, 332, and 315 </ITAG>Bonds, Federal Reserve System, Government securities.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: September 28, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Gerald Murphy,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Fiscal Assistant Secretary.</ITAG>31 CFR chapter II, part 317, Department of the Treasury Circular, PublicDebt Series No. 4-67, Revised, is hereby further revised and issued asa Second Revision, to read as follows:<ITAG tagnum="56">PART 317_REGULATIONS GOVERNING AGENCIES FOR ISSUE OF UNITED STATESSAVINGS BONDS</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="70">Sec.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">317.0 Purpose and effective date.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">317.1 Definitions.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">317.2 Organizations authorized to act.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">317.3 Procedure for qualifying and serving as issuing agent.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">317.4 Isuing agents currently qualified.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">317.5 Termination of qualification.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">317.6 Issuance of bonds.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">317.7 Obtaining and accounting for bond stock.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">317.8 Remittance of sales proceeds and registration records.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">317.9 Role of Federal Reserve Banks.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">317.10 Reservation.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority:</T4> Sec. 22 of the Second Liberty Bond Act, as amended,49 Stat. 21 (31 U.S.C. 3105) and 5 U.S.C. 301.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="80">andSection;317.0 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Purpose and effective date.</ITAG>The regulations in this part govern the manner in which an organizationmay qualify and act as an agent for the sale and issue of Series EE UnitedStates Savings Bonds.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection;317.1 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Definitions.</ITAG>(a) <T3>``Bond(s)'' </T3>means Series EE United States Savings Bonds.(b) <T3>``Federal Reserve Bank'' </T3>refers to the Federal Reserve Bank ofthe district in which the issuing agent or the applicant organization islocated, and includes the Branch(es) of the Reserve Bank, where appropriate.(c) <T3>``Issuing agent'' </T3>refers to an organization that has been granteda certificate of qualification by a Federal Reserve Bank to sell savingsbonds.
