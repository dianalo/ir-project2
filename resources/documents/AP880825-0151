Anglican Church envoy Terry Waite will be the first onereleased, the daily As-Safir said. ``The countdown has begun,'' itsaid in a one-paragraph report attributed to unidentified Westerndiplomatic sources in Moslem west Beirut.   The leftist newspaper, based in west Beirut, has goodconnections with Moslem groups that may have information on thehostages, most of whom are believed held by pro-Iranian ShiiteMoslem zealots.   Rumors of an impending release of hostages have been frequentaround the Middle East since Iran and Iraq agreed to a cease-fireand peace talks.   However, the pro-Iranian group believed to hold most of thehostages issued a statement last week denying those reports.   ``The release of Anglican Church envoy Terry Waite will be thefirst step'' to freeing the hostages, the paper said without sayingwhen that would happen.   Waite, 48, envoy of the Archbishop of Canterbury, the most Rev.Robert Runcie, disappeared Jan. 20, 1987, after leaving his westBeirut hotel to negotiate the release of American hostages held bythe pro-Iranian Islamic Jihad, or Islamic Holy War.   An anonymous caller purporting to speak for Islamic Jihad told anews agency in Beirut last week that Waite was alive and ``We mightrelease him if the government of (Prime Minister Margaret) Thatchershowed good intentions.''   However, Islamic Jihad had not claimed Waite's abduction. Italso had insisted in the past that it would communicate only inwriting and accompanied by a photograph of one of the hostages toprove the message's authenticity.   One day after the Aug. 17 telephone call, Islamic Jihad sentsuch a statement to a Western news agency, insisting that nohostage will be freed until its demands are met. That statement wasaccompanied by a photograph of American hostage Terry Anderson.``What everyone expects soon is a mirage assumed to be water by athirsty man,'' said the statement.   Anderson, 40, of Lorain, Ohio, is chief Middle Eastcorrespondent for The Associated Press. He is the longest-heldhostage, kidnapped on March 16, 1985.   ``Counting on regional and international developments will notbe of use at all in releasing the captives in Lebanon,'' thestatement said, apparently referring to the recent cease-fire inthe Iran-Iraq war and conciliatory statements by some Iranianleaders toward the West.   The hostages include eight Americans and two Britons in additionto Anderson and Waite. The other captives are a West German, anItalian, an Irishman, an Indian and two unidentified men.</TEXT></DOC>
