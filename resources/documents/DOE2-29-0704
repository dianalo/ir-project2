The key issuesof interest to a prospective lender are reviewed. Aside from normal financialcriteria such as projected cash flow and payback period, the main risksexamined by lenders are listed. Pre-completion risks include: technologicalrisks, where the credibility of a project can be enhanced if it usesa known and proven technology; construction cost overrun risk; and performancespecification risk, i.e. that a proposed project may not perform to specificationon completion. Major post-completion risks include: the marketabilityof the energy produced; the availability and price volatility of fuel,in the case of fuel-burning projects; operational and maintenance costproblems, such as equipment failures and interruptions; availabilityand skill of personnel to operate the project; risk of change in theregulatory environment; and possible changes in interest rates. A focusedapproach and a detailed presentation addressing the economics and therisks of the project will greatly assist in seeking bank financing forrenewable energy projects.</TEXT></DOC>
