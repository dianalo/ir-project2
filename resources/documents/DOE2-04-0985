<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-04-0985 </DOCNO><TEXT>Using the pumping light of a TEA-CO{sub 2} laser with etalon tuning, morethan 90 new FIR laser lines from CH{sub 3}OH, CH{sub 2}Cl{sub 2}, C{sub2}H{sub 5}OH, CF{sub 3}Br, HCOOH, and D{sub 2}O were observed. Thesenew lines are obtained from effective excitations using an etalon, whichmakes it possible to operate the TEA-CO{sub 2} laser as a tunable sourcewith single-mode emission. Furthermore, it has been found that many FIRlaser lines which were previously reported only with CW-CO{sub 2} laserpumpings also oscillate for CH{sub 3}OH, HCOOH, CH{sub 3}Br and CH{sub3}I. These lines and the newly discovered lines are the results of usingan FIR resonator of more than 3 m in length which has a high Q-factor.The Q-factor can be calculated based on the waveforms of Raman FIR laseremissions from NH{sub 3}. The waveforms are in good agreement with theoreticalpredictions. 11 references.</TEXT></DOC>
