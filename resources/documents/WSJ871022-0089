Chairman Roger Smith, who was criticized last year by fellow industrialists for enthusiastically backing tax overhaul, now feels vindicated. &quot;All the bad things that people predicted would happen, didn't happen,&quot; he says.    &quot;I can't really disagree with that,&quot; admits Charls Walker, a heavy-industry lobbyist who a year ago predicted that the law, which slashed tax rates and trimmed deductions and credits, might cause a recession. &quot;I thought it would have had a bigger impact by now.&quot;    Today, exactly one year after President Reagan signed the Tax Reform Act of 1986, the law still sparks controversy, however. Some critics of the legislation are blaming it for the recent stock-market plunge, which could stall economic growth. Kenneth Hagerty, a lobbyist for the venture-capital industry, has already started making rounds on Capitol Hill, arguing that the elimination of the tax break for long-term capital gains contributed to the crash.    But it now seems clear that the dire economic consequences of the tax overhaul were greatly exaggerated. The economy's surprising strength over the past year suggests that recent problems have little to do with that sweeping legislation. &quot;There will be people who say tax reform caused the market drop,&quot; says Joseph Minarik, an economist at the Urban Institute, &quot;but that's ridiculous.&quot;    Indeed, whatever the ultimate effects of the market's plunge, it will probably serve to reinforce the basic lesson of the past 12 months: that the economic impact of even radical tax changes can easily be overwhelmed by other events.    &quot;Taxes really don't matter that much in the broad scheme of things,&quot; Mr. Minarik says. Their effects, he adds, &quot;are subtle and a long time in coming.&quot;    A year ago, prominent economists such as former presidential adviser Martin Feldstein predicted that repeal of the investment tax credit would tip the economy into a downturn. And USX Corp. Chairman David Roderick complained that the law would put U.S. industry &quot;dead last among all countries in the world.&quot;    But instead, the manufacturers that were supposed to be hardest hit have staged a surprising recovery in the past 12 months, thanks to rising exports. And capital spending, though still weak, has been far better than expected. &quot;The dire predictions clearly haven't materialized,&quot; says Robert Greenstein, the director of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.    The tax bill still hasn't taken full effect. Many of the most beneficial provisions won't take hold until next Jan. 1. Among them: the cut in the top marginal tax rate to 33% and the rise in the standard deduction for taxpayers who don't itemize. Because such important benefits were delayed, many economists predicted last year that the tax law could damage the economy in the short run but help it in the long run.    With the first year now over, however, tax overhaul's contribution to the economy looks increasingly bright. Says Chase Manhattan Bank Chairman Willard Butcher: &quot;I'm enough of a supply sider to believe that lowering marginal tax rates ultimately will redound to the benefit of the economy.&quot;    John Creedon, the president of Metropolitan Life Insurance Co., adds: &quot;I don't think we've seen enough of the results of tax reform yet to know what its ultimate effects will be. I'd rather answer that question in mid-1989. Certainly it has slowed up some construction in the short term. But maybe in the long run it will help.&quot;    Although the short-run effects have been milder than anticipated, the legislation has still made its mark on the nation's economic landscape. Most tax shelters have been shut down, rents are starting to rise, and some types of investment have been damaged. Here are first-year effects on some major parts of the economy.    Investment   The law's repeal of the tax credit for investment, reduction in write-offs for real estate, and curbs on tax shelters all were expected to sharply depress business investment. But in fact, investment has held up surprisingly well.    Orders for nondefense capital goods, a key indicator of business investment in equipment, were a strong 16% above a year earlier in August after staying well ahead of year-earlier levels in each of the previous five months.    Even more surprising has been the strength in construction, which was expected to be especially hard hit. Through August, the amount of new construction put in place was about 2% above the 1986 period, according to Commerce Department figures. Although plans for new office buildings have soured, contracts for manufacturing plants, while still 2% below last year, are accelerating along with the expansion in manufacturing.    In a paper prepared for the National Association of Business Economists, Bernard Lashinsky, the chief economist of Inland Steel Industries Inc., writes that that performance shows that &quot;tax reform is not the dominant factor in commercial construction.&quot;    &quot;In each case,&quot; he adds, &quot;construction demand appears to be stronger than had been thought possible, and financing is available. Very possibly, people expecting a decline in construction because of tax reform meant to say, 'All other things being equal,' but just forgot. And all other things have not been equal.&quot;    Mr. Walker, the lobbyist, acknowledges that things have not been as gloomy as he predicted. But he still expects investment to suffer in the long run. &quot;The jury isn't in,&quot; he says. &quot;Certainly the legislation hasn't resulted in any strength of investment. And I still think there is a 30% chance of a recession before next year's election.&quot;    If the economy does fall into a recession, pressure is certain to increase on Congress to restore tax incentives for investment. Vice President George Bush has already said that he favors cutting the top capital gains rate to 15% from the current top marginal rate of 33%.    Charitable Gifts   Billions of dollars in charitable contributions were expected to be lost this year as a result of the 1986 tax law. That is because the lower top tax rate makes the deduction for charitable giving less valuable. In addition, the toughened alternative minimum tax on individuals reduces the tax break for some contributors.    But so far, the impact on giving has been minimal. A survey of high-income Americans, commissioned by the American Association of Fundraising Counsel, found that, compared with last year, 88% planned to give the same amount or more to charity in 1987, despite the new law.    &quot;The poll found that tax reform was neutral, that it is having no effect on contributions,&quot; said Lawrence Clancy, a vice president of the association. &quot;The key to charitable giving is that almost half the money goes for religious purposes. Unless the world ends, they are not going to stop giving.&quot;    Although overall giving has held up well, the new minimum tax has discouraged some donations of real estate and stock. Now, the appreciated value of such gifts can be subject to the minimum tax.    &quot;A number of people who were planning gifts have put them off because of the alternative minimum tax,&quot; says Richard Bailey, the executive director of the United Methodist Foundation in North Carolina. He says that three large gifts to Methodist universities -- each worth over half a million dollars -- have been held up because of uncertainties over tax effects. &quot;Donors are afraid,&quot; he says. &quot;They don't understand the alternative minimum tax, and their advisers don't understand it.&quot;    Tax Shelters   The 1986 tax act delivered a body blow to the tax-shelter industry. By preventing most taxpayers from using shelter losses to offset other income, the bill took most of the wind out of the tax-revision bubble that had expanded rapidly during the previous decade.    Real-estate shelters were the hardest hit. Registrations for private real-estate partnerships plummeted to $600 million in the first seven months of this year from $2.7 billion in the year-earlier period. &quot;The private market is in disarray,&quot; says Fuhrman Nettles, vice president of Robert H. Stanger andamp; Co., a Shrewsbury, N.J., firm that tracks tax shelters.    But tax-shelter promoters, ever ingenious, have concocted a few new products that are proving successful. For example, Norman K. Edwards, vice president of Red Eagle Exploration, is pushing a new oil and gas partnership program enabling investors to use the big tax write-offs that the tax law still allows for oil drilling.    Under the plan, investors become &quot;general&quot; partners during a project's first year. That exempts them from the new law's tough anti-tax-shelter provisions but also subjects them to unlimited liability for the actions of the partnership. However, after the first year, which is when most of the write-offs occur, the investor can switch to a limited partnership with reduced liability. Moreover, the partnership buys insurance to protect the general partners during the drilling year.    Mr. Nettles says the new partnerships, introduced in May, have already raised $58 million in the public market.    Rent   Apartment construction appears to have been hit hard by the tax act. Mr. Lashinsky cites figures showing that contracts for apartment buildings fell 16% in the first seven months of this year. And after a long pause, rents are starting to rise as vacancies begin to decline in some areas, he says. According to the Labor Department, rents surged at about an 8% annual rate in August, following a jump at a 6% annual rate in July.    &quot;We used to subsidize rents by providing significant tax benefits for construction,&quot; says Donald Ratajczak, who heads the forecasting project at Georgia State University. &quot;We took those away, and as a result we are going to have higher rents.&quot;    Tax Revenue   Tax revision was greeted with predictions from Wall Street economists that it would deepen the deficit, despite the protestations of Treasury officials and congressional tax experts to the contrary. But in the past year, the tax bill has raised nearly $20 billion more for the government than originally expected. And Treasury Secretary James Baker said recently, &quot;We're beginning to get indications that the tax bill is going to keep bringing in added revenues if we don't squeeze this economy internationally and domestically to the point that we can't do that.&quot;    The reason for Mr. Baker's optimism isn't clear. Tax experts in the Treasury and in Congress see no evidence that the revenue from tax overhaul will exceed their expectations. The unusual increase this year, they explain, was largely due to capital-gains taxes collected on a one-time surge of asset sales at the end of last year. That isn't likely to be repeated; indeed, it could reduce capital-gains tax revenues in future years.    Nevertheless, the widespread fears that tax reform would exacerbate the budget deficit appear to be unfounded.    ---                  Tax Law Provisions                    For Businesses   Corporate Tax Rates -- 34% rate; 2 lower rates on incomeup to $75,000   Investment Tax Credit -- Repealed   Depreciation -- Reduced write-offs   Business Meals and Entertainment -- 80% deductible   Oil and Gas -- Intangible drilling cost write-off cutslightly for big producers   Bank Bad-Debt Reserves -- Repealed for largest banks                    For Individuals   Individual Tax Rates -- 2 rates: 15%, 28%; a 33% topmarginal rate for some people*   Personal Exemption -- $2,000; phased out for highestincomes   Standard Deduction (Married Couples) -- $5,000   Mortgage Interest -- Deductible for first and secondhomes.
