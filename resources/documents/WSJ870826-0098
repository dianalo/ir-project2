At the same time, some of the Japanese companies intended to feel the tariff's sting may wind up dodging it by setting up factories outside Japan. Several Japanese electronics companies, including Toshiba Corp., Seiko Epson Corp., and NEC Corp., have recently announced plans to set up computer plants in the U.S. and elsewhere in Asia.    The trade measure's apparent topsy-turvy impact is an example of the way the centuries-old tactic of levying tariffs can go awry in an age where multinational corporations have factories and suppliers around the world.    At issue are a set of 100% tariffs President Reagan imposed in April on certain Japanese electronic goods, including some types of microcomputers. The tariffs were meant to punish Japanese companies for allegedly dumping semiconductors in the U.S., a charge Japan has denied.    This summer, some U.S. computer makers were stunned to discover an unexpected side effect of the new trade sanctions. The U.S. Customs Service ruled that the tariffs also covered the microchip-laden circuit-boards that make up the guts of computers. Some American computer makers manufacture those parts -- sometimes called &quot;motherboards&quot; -- overseas, and then turn them into full computers in the U.S.    The Computer and Business Equipment Manufacturers Association, a Washington trade group lobbying against the tariffs, maintains their total annual cost to U.S. companies that import mother-boards from Japan would be &quot;hundreds of millions of dollars.&quot;    The controversy turns on a hazy question of computer design: Is a mother-board a computer or a computer-part? There currently aren't any tariffs on computer parts imported from Japan.    The answer isn't clear. Some mother-boards become full computers with very little extra work. &quot;To physically assemble a PC is a no-brainer,&quot; says Norm DeWitt, a PC market researcher at Dataquest Inc. &quot;You just put a couple of screws between the mother-board and a chassis.&quot;    But for more complex computers, it isn't always that simple -- as the computer industry has been quick to point out in the recent tariff dispute. &quot;That box could also contain other important value-added subassemblies such as the power-supply and disk drive,&quot; says David Rose, an Intel Corp. trade relations manager. &quot;Intel typically will use a board like this in conjunction with three to 13 other board assemblies in a single box.&quot;    Intel, based in Santa Clara, Calif., is best known as a microchip maker, but also makes circuit-boards filled with its chips. It sparked the current dispute this summer by questioning a Customs Service ruling that its boards fell within the tariffs' reach.    The Washington computer trade group said it understands International Business Machines Corp. was also affected by the new tariffs, because it buys boards for its new Personal System/2 line of PCs from Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. of Japan. Armonk, N.Y.-based IBM said it is studying the tariff but wouldn't comment on it yet. It said Matsushita is one of its suppliers but wouldn't say what it buys from the Japanese company.    Computer makers and the Customs Service disagree over how mother-boards were previously treated for tariff purposes. The Customs Service says the Intel ruling only reaffirmed longtime tariff policy, and didn't represent a change. But the trade group says it has evidence going back for 15 years that the boards have been levied as parts, not computers. </TEXT></DOC>
