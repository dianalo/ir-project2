Rep. Ron Wyden, D-Oregon, said Friday he had learned that theEconomic Policy Council, chaired by Treasury Secretary NicholasBrady, was recommending to President Bush that the administrationinclude Japan on the list for its barriers to the sale of Americanwood products.   The list is expected to be released perhaps as early as Tuesday.   The New York Times reported Friday that the Japanese wouldlikely be cited for failing to open their market to the sale ofU.S. supercomputers. The newspaper said that the 12-nation EuropeanCommunity could possibly be included as well for governmentsubsidies to Airbus, the government-backed aircraft manufacturer.   The newspaper said that Brazil and India were also beingconsidered for including on the list of priority nations becausecompanies in both countries are allowed to pirate U.S. patents,copyrights and trademarks.   Christina McCowan, a spokeswoman for U.S. Trade RepresentativeCarla Hills, refused to comment on the paper's list of countriesother than to say that the final list of countries and products hadyet to be determined.   At the White House, deputy presidential spokesman B. Jay Coopersaid that the matter was still ``under interagency review. It hasnot gone to the president yet.''   Under the Omnibus Trade Act of 1988, the administration mustissue by May 28 a list of countries that maintain persistent tradebarriers that impede American sales.   Those countries would be targeted for intensive negotiationsover the next 18 months with the threat of retaliation againsttheir exports to the United States if no agreement is reached toremove the barriers.   While the list must be submitted to Congress by Ms. Hills, thedecision on what countries and products to include will be made byBush.   The administration has been under heavy congressional pressureto name Japan to the list because of that country's huge tradesurplus with the United States, which last year totaled $52billion, 44 percent of the $119.8 billion total U.S. trade deficit.   The compilation of a priority list of countries was mandated bythe massive rewrite of the country's trade law which Congresspassed last year. The provision, known as Super 301 for the sectioncontaining the requirement, has turned out to be the mostcontroversial provision in the 1,000-page law.   It has triggered sharp disagreement even within theadministration with the president's chief economic adviser, MichaelBoskin, warning that vigorous enforcement of the provision ran therisk of counter-retaliation by other countries which could plungethe world into a global recession.   Both South Korea and Taiwan figured prominently in an initiallist of 34 countries with barriers against U.S. products which Ms.Hills issued three weeks ago. It is from that list that the finalpriority list of negotiating targets will be drawn up.   A congressional source, who spoke on condition his name not beused, said there was a good likelihood that South Korea and Taiwanwould be kept off the final list because of concessions they havealready made.   On Thursday, Ms. Hills announced that South Korea had agreed toa number of market-opening actions which the United States had beenseeking.   In addition, the trade representative's office announced Fridaythat Korea had agreed to open its market to imports of manyagricultural products, ranging from poultry parts to bourbon, inthree stages between July 1989 and January 1991.   Ms. Hills called the agreement ``a positive first step'' butsaid many U.S. products still would be restricted or banned inKorea. ``I am prepared to take action on these products if Korea'sliberalization process does not continue,'' she said.</TEXT></DOC>
