Crude oil prices did fall sharply in U.S. futures tradingyesterday morning. But they rebounded in the afternoon to endthe day mixed with near-month crude contracts only slightlylower.</LP><TEXT>   The August crude contract was down two cents a barrel onthe New York Mercantile Exchange to settle at $18.65 afterdropping to a low of $18.11 during the day. Crude futures forSeptember delivery settled eight cents lower at $19.77 abarrel.   On the assumption a correction was overdue, many tradershad expected major price drops in the August and Septembercrudes after the gains of $2 a barrel in the prior sixtrading sessions. But prices were kept relatively firm by awidespread belief that burdensome U.S. crude oil inventoriesare shrinking and by the continuing euphoria overdevelopments in the Organization of Petroleum ExportingCountries.   After futures trading had closed for the day, the AmericanPetroleum Institute released its latest weekly report on U.S.oil statistics. The report showed that inventories of crudeoil and gasoline rose last week, by 4.7 million barrels andtwo million barrels, respectively, rather than declining asexpected.   Oil analysts agreed these were bearish figures. Butseveral said they are likely to have only a moderate effecton the bullishness emerging over the expected outcome of nextweek's OPEC meetings.   As the result of last week's pledges by Kuwait and theUnited Arab Emirates to reduce production to quota levels,OPEC is widely expected to freeze its production ceiling nearthe current 22.1 million barrels a day and reduce totaloutput to 23 million barrels a day or less for the remainderof the third quarter. Many analysts expect this to restorebalance to supply and demand for OPEC oil.   Iraq President Saddam Hussein, who has been aggressivelypressuring Kuwait and the Emirates to cut theiroverproduction, helped bolster world oil prices againyesterday with new threats to deal with force with OPECmembers violating their production quotas.   &quot;With Iraq flexing its muscles in OPEC, there is a returnto the policies of the early 1980s with the emphasis onprices rather than on market shares,&quot; said Peter Beutel, anoil specialist with Merrill Lynch Futures.   In other markets yesterday:                                                                                                          GRAINS and SOYBEANS: Prices of corn futures contractscontinued to slide amid good growing weather. So far thismonth, the value of some corn futures contracts have droppedabout 15%. Some crop analysts are beginning to edge up theirharvest estimates. Katharina Zimmer, an analyst at MerrillLynch, New York, has been forecasting a 7.7 billion bushelcorn crop. However, she said the weather in the Midwest isincreasing the possibility of a 7.85 billion bushel harvest.The good growing weather is also at least partly responsiblefor an anemic export market. Foreign buyers aren't in anyrush to acquire U.S. corn because there is little indicationso far that any shortages might develop at harvest. What'smore, there are widespread reports that the Soviet Union, oneof the biggest buyers of U.S. crops, is continuing to havedifficulty paying its bills for imports. Analysts aren't surewhether U.S. corn prices might drop further. Despite thismonth's weather in the Midwest, the corn crop is unusuallyvulnerable. Because wet weather this spring delayed thegrowing season, much of the corn crop is only beginning to gothrough its critical pollination stage. In many of thebiggest corn-producing states, pollination normally haspeaked by now. The late growing season makes the crop moresusceptible to summer heat waves and fall frosts. Outside themajor corn-producing states in the Midwest, the crop isfacing other problems. The south Texas crop, which is one ofthe first to be harvested in the U.S., could face its secondoutbreak of aflatoxin in two years. Aflatoxin is a poisonthat is excreted by a fungus under drought conditions. Lastyear, much of the corn crop in the region had to be destroyedor diverted to livestock use because it contained levels toodangerous for human consumption. Because of dry weatherearlier this season, state and federal officials arepreparing to sample the crop for aflatoxin in the next fewweeks. In the Southeast, dry conditions earlier this seasonhave already forced some farmers to abandon their fields.                                                                                                          ORANGE JUICE: Futures prices declined. The July contract,which will cease trading today, ended with a loss of 2.60cents a pound at $1.8695. September, the most active month,was off 1.90 cents to $1.7840. Analysts said traders will beclosely watching the last day of activity in the Julycontract. &quot;It could be a very volatile session,&quot; one analystsaid. Only 97 notices have been issued for the delivery ofthe concentrate against the July contract. As of thebeginning of trading yesterday, the July open interest, orthe number of contracts that remain to be nullified by anopposite trade or fulfilled by delivery of concentrate, was1,670 contracts. Despite active liquidation yesterday, whichdepressed prices, the number of contracts outstanding isexpected to remain the largest on the last trading day thattraders and analysts can recall. For the most part, analystssaid, processors are holders of contracts calling for them totake delivery of the commodity because the price of thefuture is well below the cash-market quotation. On the otherhand, most &quot;shorts,&quot; or traders who sold in anticipation thatprices would go lower, are speculators. However, prices neverfell as much as speculators anticipated, an analyst said.                                                                                                          PRECIOUS METALS: Futures prices eased. August deliverygold ended at $363, down $1.50 an ounce. September silverdeclined 3.5 cents an ounce to $4.8680. October platinum wasoff $2.50 an ounce at $479.30. August gold was under somepressure early in the morning, in part because the Dow JonesIndustrial Average at that time was trading over 3000 andalso because there was a spate of selling in silver byspeculators and local traders that produced a sympatheticreaction in gold, according to analysts. August gold tradedas low as $361.60. In the afternoon, however, the industrialaverage slipped below 3000, which appeared to give some liftto precious metals, analysts said. Mostly, analysts said,traders were waiting for Federal Reserve Chairman AlanGreenspan's semiannual testimony before the Senate BankingCommittee today, in which he will outline the central bank'smonetary policy. &quot;It's more like waiting for the second shoeto drop,&quot; said one analyst, noting Mr. Greenspan's testimonylast week, that the Fed was poised to ease its monetarypolicy, caused precious metals prices to surge. &quot;Traders wantto know if last Friday's cut in a key rate was a one-timething or whether there will be a further reduction,&quot; theanalyst said.</TEXT></DOC>
