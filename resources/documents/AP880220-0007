The forecast, however, is based on an expected jump in pork andpoultry production, which should more than offset a drop in beefoutput in figuring retail food prices, according to a USDA reportissued this week.   That does not necessarily mean any boon for consumers unwillingto forgo beef in favor of pork and poultry. The NationalCattlemen's Association already is hailing a decline of 3 millionhead in the U.S. herd as of Jan. 1 to 99 million as a ``bullish''signal for increased beef prices.   USDA's Economic Research Service says red meat production in1987 totaled 38,449,000 pounds and poultry 19,765,000 pounds.Consumption of red meat and poultry combined was 216.7 pounds percapita last year.   The forecast issued this week said red meat production this yearshould reach 38,345,000 pounds and poultry 20,935,000. It estimatedper capita consumption at 221.9 pounds.   Retail food prices last year were 333 percent of their 1967level, according to the report. The report did not attempt toestimate precisely how much they would climb over the year aheadbut merely said the increase would be less than that of 1987.   The report also said hog profits fell sharply in the finalquarter of 1987 and probably will continue to drop this year. Netreturns could average only slightly above the break-even point, itsaid.</TEXT><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Overseas sale of U.S. wheat climbed sharplylast week, primarily because of Soviet, Chinese and Moroccanpurchases, the Agriculture Department says.
