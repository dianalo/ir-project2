John Hiler of Indiana. Rep. Hiler serves onthe House Banking Committee, has voted with and receivedcampaign contributions from the thrift industry, and hasnever had an easy race since his 1980 election.   But the Democrat has a problem: His most recent job wasworking for Arizona Sen. Dennis DeConcini, one of thenow-notorious Keating Five group of lawmakers accused ofintervening with regulators on behalf of a high-poweredthrift executive.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Roemer's predicament symbolizes Democrats'frustrations over the Sandamp;L issue so far this year. On thesurface, the issue seems heaven-sent: a hugely expensivescandal they can argue was nurtured during Republicanadministrations, was made possible by Republican policies andhas gotten worse since a Republican president declared lastyear that it was fixed.   But so far, the Democrats have had little success attranslating outrage at the scandal into a political issue.And where it has emerged as an issue, they have been just aslikely as Republicans to be hurt by it. After all, formerHouse Speaker James Wright and former House Democratic WhipTony Coehlo were both closely identified with the Sandamp;L crisis,and four of the Keating Five are Democrats. Moreover, manyDemocrats in Congress voted for some of the legislation nowbeing blamed for helping cause the crisis.   A new nationwide Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll pointsup both the potential and the problems that the thrift crisisholds for Democrats. The poll shows that by a margin of 39%to 17%, voters hold the GOP more responsible than theDemocrats for the crisis. And they are evenly split overPresident Bush's handling of the problem; 38% approve, 37%disapprove.   Yet the survey also shows that a majority of voters blamethe crisis much more on thrift-industry executives than onanyone in Washington, Republican or Democrat. And in anespecially disheartening finding for the Democrats, voterssplit almost evenly over whether they trust the GOP or theDemocrats more to handle the crisis.   Over the long run, however, many observers think thecrisis will benefit the Democrats. Democratic NationalChairman Ron Brown has already issued a clarion call to hisparty's candidates to seize on the scandal, and GOP politicaltheorist Kevin Phillips says &quot;the general context helps theDemocrats.&quot; The issue has emerged in a half-dozen to a dozencongressional races this year and is likely to be even moreimportant in 1992. &quot;It's an issue that's only going to getbigger,&quot; says Ed Rollins, co-chairman of the Republicans'House campaign committee.   The pollsters who conducted the Journal/NBC survey, PeterHart, a Democrat, and Robert Teeter, a Republican, say voters&quot;have figured out the villains, and they want to punish them.They see no heroes, but above all they don't want to getpenalized or have to pay for the greed of others.&quot;   Clearly, the poll shows that many voters are angry at thethrift industry -- and aren't very happy about the Bushadministration's approach to the problem so far. By 79% to13%, they favor appointing a special prosecutor toinvestigate the industry, and by 60% to 30% they would favordoubling the number of federal auditors examining thrifts'books.   Moreover, 43% even favor getting rid of Sandamp;Ls entirely byforcing them to become commercial banks; about the samepercentage oppose such a step. A substantial majority, 57%,opposes reducing federal deposit insurance from the current$100,000 per account, a level that some experts believecontributed to the crisis. Some GOP lawmakers at leastprivately favor reducing the coverage.   Some of that voter anger was evident at a Fourth of Julyparade in Molalla, Ore. &quot;All of those Sandamp;L crooks should be injail,&quot; declared Richard Cutler, a retired postal worker inSalem. Yet even as Mr. Cutler was talking, two people passingbefore him showed how the issue hasn't yet maturedpolitically.   The two were GOP Rep. Denny Smith and his opponent, MikeKopetski, who represents one of the Democrats' best shots atusing the Sandamp;L crisis to knock off a GOP incumbent.   The ammunition is there. Until 1987, Rep. Smith was adirector of an Oregon thrift that crashed, costing thegovernment $113 million. He also lobbied with regulators onbehalf of Sandamp;L executives who contributed to his campaign, andhe sought immunity from lawsuits for himself and other thriftdirectors. He denies any wrongdoing but concedes that hismembership on the board of American Federal Savings andamp; Loan ofSalem was unwise &quot;because it's a perceived conflict ofinterest.&quot;   Yet so far, at least, the issue doesn't seem to be cuttingvery deeply. Fairly typical is the attitude of Roger Jordan,city manager of the Oregon town of Dallas, where one localthrift failed and was later sold. &quot;All of us are touched byit, but I don't have anyone to blame,&quot; he says.   Some Democratic strategists believe Mr. Kopetski should dosomething dramatic, such as filing an ethics complaintagainst Rep. Smith. But Kopetski aides say they thinkcriticisms of Rep. Smith would have much more credibility ifsomeone else -- the media, or people hurt directly by thedemise of the institution on whose board Rep. Smith sat --makes a case against him.   That way, they say, the issue would have more punch whenMr. Kopetski does take it up directly. &quot;It's a legitimateissue, and I'm sure it will be used in our campaign,&quot; saysthe candidate, who came within 707 votes of beating Rep.Smith in 1988. &quot;But it will be used later.&quot;   In contrast to Mr. Kopetski, Indiana challenger Mr. Roemerhas tried to make the thrift crisis an issue against Rep.Hiler. But his attacks so far have misfired. After anewspaper published an interview in which the Democratassailed Mr. Hiler for voting with the thrift industry on acrucial issue, Mr. Hiler was able to rebut the charge bynoting that the vote in question took place before he waselected. (Mr. Roemer says he was misquoted.)   Rep. Hiler and his campaign aides are hitting back,stressing Mr. Roemer's own vulnerabilities. &quot;He was under thetutelage of the master of the Sandamp;Ls -- Dennis DeConcini,&quot; saysPat Hinton, Rep. Hiler's campaign manager. (Mr. Roemerstresses that he didn't advise the senator on bankingmatters.) This week, the Hiler campaign began airingtelevision spots attacking Mr. Roemer's credibility on theSandamp;L issue.   In California's Central Valley, there's another likely GOPtarget, Rep. Charles &quot;Chip&quot; Pashayan. In 1986, Mr. Pashayanreceived $26,000 in campaign contributions from CharlesKeating and his associates. But virtually the only timeDemocratic challenger Calvin Dooley publicly raised the issuewas at a recent press conference -- in Washington.   Some Republicans, of course, also have been maladroit infiring Sandamp;L salvos. Although Texas Democratic Rep. JimChapman's 1985 campaign benefited from independentexpenditures from Sandamp;L political action committees that arecurrently under federal investigation, his GOP opponent,businessman Hamp Hodges, says he needs more time to researchthe matter before he uses it in his campaign.   While challengers are still figuring out how to capitalizeon the issue, some Democratic incumbents have problems oftheir own. Once seen as a plum assignment, serving as asenior Democrat on the House Banking Committee has now becomea political liability for Illinois Rep. Frank Annunzio, whoheads the National Republican Congressional Committee's listof targeted incumbents.   &quot;As current chairman of the House subcommittee thatoversees the savings and loan industry, Frank Annunzio ispart of the savings and loan problem,&quot; charges his opponent,Republican state Sen. Walter Dudycz. For his part, Rep.Annunzio says Republicans are after him because he heldhighly publicized hearings on possible misconduct by thepresident's son, Neil Bush, as director of a failed Sandamp;L.   Rep. Annunzio's northwest Chicago district is generallyconsidered a Democratic stronghold, and many voters theretake attitudes similar to that of Wayne Hanson, a managementrepresentative for a painting and drywall company. &quot;There'sdirty laundry that can always be found on both sides,&quot; hesays.   Still, the crusty, 75-year-old Rep. Annunzio is concernedenough that he recently committed an act of politicalexorcism. He had the portrait of former Banking CommitteeChairman Fernand St Germain, a Rhode Island Democrat and amajor figure in the Sandamp;L debacle, removed from the committeeroom. In its place, Mr. Annunzio hung a white banner thatblared PUT THE Sandamp;L CROOKS IN JAIL.   Banking Committee Democrats are also coming under fire fortheir access to political contributions from the thriftindustry. In Georgia, Sam Jones, a former minister and familycounselor favored to win next week's Republican primary, hasput up billboards urging Democratic Rep. Doug Barnard to giveback $20,000 that he received from Mr. Keating and hisassociates in 1986. &quot;Either Mr. Barnard was asleep at thewheel or he was taking a little payola,&quot; Mr. Jones says.   Rep. Barnard, though, believes that the issue hasn'tcaught on in his district. Voters are saying &quot;very little&quot; tohim about the Sandamp;Ls, he says, because &quot;they don't understandthe problem.&quot; Although he says &quot;I'm not trying to minimizethe intellect of the voters,&quot; he believes that most lack the&quot;time and inclination&quot; to examine the issue and decide who'sat fault.   If that is true, it has worked, at least so far, toPresident Bush's advantage. The Journal/NBC survey shows thatonly a tiny 3% minority currently believe that Mr. Bush ismost responsible for the Sandamp;L mess.   But many observers expect that figure to rise as time goeson, the problems become more apparent and the political angerrises. If so, Democratic Chairman Brown hopes that the issuewill someday evolve into a major weapon against theRepublicans. Ultimately, he predicts, Mr. Bush is going to be&quot;in real trouble.&quot;   ---      Which party do you feel is more responsible for     The savings and loan problems facing the country?
