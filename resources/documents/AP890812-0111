The rally near Eastern headquarters was attended by a crowdestimated at 300 to 500 people.   ``These people over across the street have done a good job intheir psychological warfare. Now they're out there telling theworld it's over. Well, it's not over,'' said Charles E. Bryan,District 100 president of the Machinists union. ``So hang in there.There'll be good news coming.''   Henry A. Duffy, national president of the Air Line PilotsAssociation, joined Bryan and other Machinists, pilots and flightattendants on the first blocks of a ``moving picket line'' march.   ``Journey for Justice,'' read T-shirts worn by many of thepicketers.   The rally opened a 26-day series of parades, motorcades,rallies, petition drives and lobbying planned in 13 states.   ALPA, which represents pilots at nearly every major carrier, hasbeen discussing a nationwide job action to show support for Easternworkers.   Duffy said the unions want to ensure that the public understandsthat the strike, which began March 4, is still on. The unions alsowant to spur congressional action, pressure President Bush tointervene and revitalize solidarity throughout the national labormovement, he said.   Duffy said labor leaders will urge Senate Majority Leader GeorgeMitchell, D-Maine, to push a House-passed bill calling on Bush toappoint a presidential emergency board that could send the unionsback to work while trying to reach a settlement. Duffy called thataction the best hope for ending the strike.   Bush refused in the early days of the strike to intervene.   ``This is an important strike, not only for ALPA and Easternemployees, but for the national labor movement,'' Duffy said,adding that what he called the anti-union management tactics ofTexas Air Corp. Chairman Frank Lorenzo must be stopped. He alsopredicted Eastern won't survive unless its veteran employees returnto work.   ``The publicity turned against us, but not to the point it'sgoing to stop the strike,'' Duffy added in an interview.   Discussion a week ago by the pilots' union leadership aboutending the strike spurred the most picket-line crossovers since thewalkout's first week. An estimated 250 union pilots returned towork last week, prompting Eastern to stop hiring new pilots, andabout 140 flight attendants crossed the lines.   Eastern said Friday it has enough pilots for its plan to rebuilddespite the strike, but Bryan said Eastern, because of a shortageof mechanics and spare parts, doesn't have enough flight-readyplanes.   John J. Bavis, Eastern's ALPA local chairman, said Eastern'sannouncement was meant to hurt union morale.   ``They want to scare the hell out of people, trying to breakus,'' Bavis said.   Bryan, who said only 2 percent of his union's 8,500 members havereturned to work, said the pilot crossovers ``has been damaging tothe morale of the people'' because the Machinists emphasized theimportance of pilot support. The Machinists struck after 1{ yearsof federal mediation failed and were joined by the pilots andflight attendants.   Company spokesman Robin Matell declined to comment on the unionrally and denied that Eastern had claimed victory.   ``There are no winners in a strike,'' he said. Friday'sannouncement was ``just to state the facts'' that no more pilotsare needed, Matell said.   Eastern, which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganizationfive days into the strike, plans to rebuild to an airlinetwo-thirds of its pre-strike size. The company's plan for itscreditors said it will fly 800 daily flights with 1,700 pilots bythe end of the year.   Eastern has 350 daily flights, compared with nearly 1,100 beforethe strike.   Sources speaking on condition of anonymity have said more than600 union pilots, of 3,600, have returned to work, joining 300newly hired pilots who completed training and 700 to 800 intraining.</TEXT></DOC>
