The authors studied ten patients with the clinical diagnosisof pancreatitis by In-111-labeled white blood cell scanning and CT andcompared results with the clinical course. Of three patients who hadpancreatic bed activity on In-111 WBC images, one had a normal pancreaticCT scan and two had mild pancreatic enlargement. All had complicatedclinical courses. Of the seven patients with negative In-111 WBC scans,six had acute pancreatitis with elevated serum amylase levels and uncomplicatedclinical courses. One patient had a normal serum amylase level, a negativeIn-111 WBC scan, and a diffuse pancreatic abscess on CT scan. The authorsconclude that In-111 WBC scanning may be useful in determining earlythe prognosis of patients with acute pancreatitis.</TEXT></DOC>
