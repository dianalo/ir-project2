Quantitative risk estimates forcancer induction are derived, mainly from analyses of epidemiologicaldata. The Report addresses the health outcomes of exposure to radon andits daughters, primarily lung cancer risks of worker exposure to radonprogeny in underground mines and in the general public in indoor domesticenvironments. An excess relative risk model of lung cancer mortalityand exposure to radon progeny is developed; this models the excess riskper Working Level Month in terms of time intervals prior to an attainedage, and is dependent on time-since-exposure and age at risk. Risk projectionsare presented and cover exposure situations of current public healthconcern. For example, lifetime exposure to 1 WLM y{sup {minus}1} is estimatedto increase the number of deaths due to lung cancer by a factor of about1.5 over the current rate for both males and females in a populationhaving the current prevalence of cigarette-smoking. Occupational exposureto 4 WLM y{sup {minus}1} from ages 20 y to 40 y is projected to increaselung cancer deaths by a factor of 1.6 over the current rate of this agecohort in the general population. In all of these cases, most of theincreased risk occurs to smokers for whom the risk is up to ten timesgreater than for non-smokers. 8 refs., 1 tab.</TEXT></DOC>
