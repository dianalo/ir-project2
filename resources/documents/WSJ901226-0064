Barrett   Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DATE>12/26/90</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE 12</SO><IN>LAW AND LEGAL AFFAIRS (LAW)ENVIRONMENT (ENV)</IN><GV>JUSTICE DEPARTMENT (JUS)</GV><LP>   WASHINGTON -- After a record-breaking year of criminal-lawenforcement, the Justice Department's environmental chief isconsidering ways to create safe harbors to shelter fromprosecution polluters that are trying to clean up their acts.   Assistant Attorney General Richard Stewart, a professor onleave from Harvard Law School, has intensified criminalprosecution of environmental violations, which only a fewyears ago typically were addressed through civil litigation.In the year ended Sept. 30, federal grand juries returned 134felony indictments for environmental crimes, 33% more than inthe previous year.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;Both the statistics and the big cases&quot; -- such as theindictment of Exxon Corp. for the 1989 Alaska oil spill --&quot;indicate the advancement of innovative concepts forprotecting the environment and enforcing existing laws,&quot; saysFred Krupp, executive director of the Environmental DefenseFund, a research and advocacy group here.   Mr. Stewart himself speaks proudly of this aggressiveapproach. But in almost the same breath, he says that federalprosecutors &quot;don't have coherent guidelines on how to drawthe line between criminal and civil&quot; enforcement.   Noted for his seminal academic work on creating economicincentives for pollution control, Mr. Stewart fears thatironically, overly enthusiastic criminal prosecution mayencourage companies to overlook their environmentaltransgressions and cover up those they do know about.   The treatment of internal corporate environmental auditsillustrates the problem.   Over the past decade, businesses increasingly have reliedon in-house reviews to try to stay in compliance with theexpanding number of environmental statutes and regulations.Experts in the field applaud the trend toward self-policing.But in an era of stiffened criminal enforcement, internaldocuments describing instances of noncompliance can becomeevidence of &quot;knowing&quot; violations that send people to jail. Asa result, says John Quarles, a former EnvironmentalProtection Agency official who now practices corporate lawhere, his clients &quot;are agonizing over&quot; whether to documenttheir own environmental shortcomings honestly.   The stakes can be high: Last year, the president ofMacDonald andamp; Watson Waste Oil Co., Johnston, R.I., wassentenced to 28 months in prison for environmental crimesafter a prosecution that relied in part on evidence frominternal audit documents.   &quot;The normal reaction of the prosecutor is (that) you don'tgive any aid or comfort to violators of the law,&quot; says Mr.Stewart. &quot;The problem is that we aren't talking about bankrobbers here. We are talking about&quot; companies engaged in&quot;productive economic activity, and we want there to beincentives for improved compliance.&quot;   Industry advocates have sought federal legislationimmunizing companies from criminal liability based oninternal audits. Some lawmakers expressed interest in theidea, but it wasn't included in this year's amendment of theClear Air Act.   Not waiting for legislative action, Mr. Stewart says he isdrafting standards for prosecutors. He hopes to issue themearly next year. He is nervous about sharing specifics beforethe guidelines are cleared by more-senior administrationofficials, but basic principles he is mulling includeestablishing that audits won't be used in criminalprosecutions if they were performed in &quot;good faith&quot; andresulted in &quot;prompt remedial action.&quot;   Those terms obviously would be vulnerable to manipulationby lawyers. &quot;The danger,&quot; Mr. Stewart says, &quot;is, what do youdo when a company rushes out to do an audit as cover&quot; forearlier violations.   Corporate defenders applaud Mr. Stewart's concern, butthey remain cautious. &quot;He sure found the problem,&quot; says Mr.Quarles. But the former EPA official adds, &quot;The solution isnowhere in sight.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
