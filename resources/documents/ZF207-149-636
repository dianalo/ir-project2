no wordby press-time.andM;If anyone still believes the protestations of all the computer companieshoisting storm cones that the problems in the US market are short term anddown to one-off special factors, the April 1 issue of Datamation magazineshould finally convince them that they are only fooling themselves: in itsannual budget survey, Datamation finds that US manufacturers, servicesuppliers and government agencies have scaled back the growth of theirinformation systems budgets to a mere 4.4% over that for 1988 - 1988 was 7.8%over 1987, and 1987 5.1% over 1986; the figures imply no growth at all inpersonal computer sales to large users, since buyers say that they willaccount for 29.1% of total expenditure, down from 33.1% last year, althoughsoftware for the micros people already have will do rather better, withexpenditure on new software at 12.6% of the average total budget, up from10.7% last year; nevertheless, the chief executives.andP;  financial officers andDP managers polled, do not see the low growth in their computer budgetsreflecting performance in the US economy as a whole - most don't see arecession this year, and look for their companies' businesses to grow anaverage 9.3% during 1989.andM;But in Europe, the Wall Street Journal has amassed figures that purport toshow that after 1992, the European personal computer market will exceed thatof the US: projections from Compaq Computer Corp suggest that unit sales oneach side of the water will be between 7m and 9m, worth $30,000m in eachcase, in 1992, against 5.5m, worth $18,000m, in the US and only 3.6m, worth$15,000m, in Europe in 1988; Intelligent Electronics SA reckons that IBM took24% of the 1988 European market, Olivetti 8%, Apple Computer 7%, Compaq 6%,Commodore International 3%, Hewlett-Packard 3% and all others 49%.andM;Following an agreement with Pahldata SA, Amstrad de Espana SA is to marketthe Spanish company's Pahltex modem card and communications program with itsmicros in Spain: the product retails for $770 and enables users to accesselectronic mail and viewdata systems, the addon consisting of a V23 modem forMSDOS micros, connectable to any 1,200/75bps electronic mail system, andviewdata terminal emulation software, all approved by Telefonica SA under thename of Amstex; the move will enable Pahldata to introduce its card into thegeneral con-sumer market, and the company looks to sell 15,000 over threeyears.andM;Sun Microsystems Inc's plans over the next three to six months are thought toinclude three new Sparc-based machines including the low-end &quot;Sparcintosh&quot;(CI No 1,139), a mid-range machine priced similarly to the $20,000 Sun 4/110and rated at 10 to 15 MIPS, and an 11 to 20 MIPS system costing around$40,000 - and then there are the two new 68030 models, including a $30,000model expected to use the 33MHz version of the Motorola processor, and alow-end $10,000 machine.andM;And there are even rumours of a Sun 486i, although this is not expected tosee the light of day until the very end of 1989, and further out, a 35 to 40MIPS Sparc-based server.andM;But you pays your money and you takes your choice, and Computer Reseller Newsis going for a $12,000 to $13,000 workstation code-named Hydra, with 8Mb,200Mb disk and 19&quot; monochrome monitor rated at 6 MIPS to 7 MIPS - could be inthe x86i series - and that the lowest Sparc model is code-named Campus, andrated at 12 to 14 MIPS and to cost only $1,000 or so more than the Hydra; weshall see.andM;The Microelectronics andamp; Computer Technology corp research cooperative inAustin, Texas, and the University of Houston have joined forces to initiateresearch into high temperature superconductivity, it was announced at theground-breaking ceremony for a building to house and Texas Center forSupreconductivity at the University: under the three-year agreement, membersof the co-op interested in the work will pay $150,000 a year to fund theresearch effort; among those interested are Bellcore, Boeing Co, MotorolaInc, 3M, DEC, Westinghouse Electric and DuPont.andM;Commodore International Ltd says that an upgrade board for the Amiga 2000that will convert it into the company's proposed Amiga 2500 Unix machine (CINo 1,139) should cost around #1,700 - but although a Commodore spokesman saidhe hoped the box would be available &quot;this year&quot;, there is no firm date on aproduct release, and still less so on a proposed 68030 version also underdevelopment: however, a version of Sun's Network File system for the Amiga isavailable from networking specialists Torus Ltd in Cambridge.andM;Istel SA, partowned by Dutch multinational international Computer Group andnothing to do with Istel Group Ltd here, has started selling its viewdataapplication software packages under Unix in Spain: the product, based on amodular combination of C language programs, runs at realtime processing speedto supports over 1,000 simultaneous accesses to different applications on asingle viewdata server; applications include network management, statistics,X400 electronic mail, electronic mail for the general public, cataloguemarketing, binary data downloading, electronic directory, informationretrieval, document search, and virtual circuits.andM;Tandem Computers Inc, Cupertino and Relational Technology Inc, Alameda, havesigned for joint development and marketing of a version of the Ingressdatabase tools for use with the Tandem NonStop SQL relational databasemanagement system: the financial terms were not disclosed.andM;The US Postal Service is soliciting bids for facsimile machines to beinstalled in 260 US post offices as an experiment: payment will be by creditcard to cover the service and phone costs, but rates have not yet been set;the machines are expected to be designed to store received documents for aperiod of time, so that customers do not have to be on hand when they arrive.andM;National Semiconductor Corp is to close its manufacturing facility inDanbury, Connecticut in February next year, affecting about 400 people: thatplant makes transistors and a range of products using CMOS and Bipolarprocesses and the work will transfer to other plants.andM;Is the Apple II, contemporary of all those Z80-based 8-bit CP/M micros,finally to be put out to grass and an honourable retirement?andP;  Newsbytesreports that &quot;speculation is rampant&quot; that the next incarnation of thefoundations of Apple Computer Inc's fortunes, a IIGS upgrade expected to beunveiled at Applefest in May, will be the last for the 12-year old line:software developers are not writing much for the II these days, and the lineis estimated to have contributed only $130m to Apple's $4,000m plus sales in1988, down from $800m in 1984 (for the record, the Apple I was a single boardcomputer that sold no more than a hundred or two units).andM;In a move that will no doubt raise an eyebrow at Comparex InformationssystemeGmbH, Sterling Software International has decided to call a new utility forthe direct comparison of two files &quot;Comparex&quot;; it also al-lows access toother file structures via a user-definable interface.andM;Boole andamp; Babbage has now formally acquired Mission Computer Services, ofSunnyvale, California; as reported earlier (CI No 1,097), the companyprovides mainframe computing services on a timesharing basis, and alsodevelops mainframe utility software products: by merging Mission's datacentre with its own, Boole claims that it will be able to provide both itsown and its distributors' engineers with &quot;advanced&quot; data-processing services.andM;ExMetropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Kenneth Newman has been enlisted onthe strength of his &quot;intimate knowledge of the force&quot; to advise oracle UK onsupplying applications to the police;

and - didn't youjust know it? - the company now faces five lawsuits seeking class actionstatus from disaffected shareholders.andM;Someone wants to scupper the deal under which BellSouth corp agreed to pay$710m for Mobile Communications Corp of America, Jackson, Mississippi a yearago, before prices for cellular firms soared outasight (CI No 1,117): thetakeover is still awaiting approval for completion and in the meantime, anunidentified client of John Corneliusson Capital Markets Inc of Wisconsin haspaid $80.4m for 16.6% of Class A, 6.2% of Class B shares.andM;Unisys Corp has settled the fraud charges brought by the US over an Air Forceupgrade contract won by Sperry Corp, paying $700,000 payment to thegovernment in return for Federal authorities dismissing the indictment:Unisys also agreed to abandon a claim against the government by sperry formore than $800,000 in disputed unpaid invoices, describing the decision tosettle as a business one to avoid continuing litigation; the companyandM;Kalamazoo Plc shares plunged 10 pence to 38 pence after the Birminghamcompany that majors on systems for the motor trade warned that it was nowunlikely to make up the first half losses caused by its reorganisation duringthe second half of its year to July, and will likely make a loss for the fullyear.andM;A Japanese vice-minister is visiting US trade representative Carla Hills totalk about the nagging problem of US semiconductor sales to Japan over thenext few days, but in the meantime, the sanctions imposed by President reaganon Japanese electronics firms for alleged non-compliance with the US-JapanSemiconductor Trade Pact are to remain in force, Ms Hills has assuredRepresentative Richard Gephardt, one of the early casualties among theDemocrat's Seven Dwarfs.andM;There's little for Prime Computer Inc's comfort in MAI Basic Four Inc'sresponse to the ruling by the US Court of Appeals for the First Circuit (CINo 1,145): the Tustin, California company says that the &quot;opinion providesthat the existing orders enjoining the consummation of MBF's tender offer forPrime's common shares should be vacated upon making specified disclosuresconcerning Drexel Burnham: these disclosures are substantially less onerousthan the disclosures which (sic) Prime had requested be made&quot;
