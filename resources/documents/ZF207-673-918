(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Scanning the depths of colorandM;Having the ability to scan color means being able to take full advantage of acolor Macintosh.andM;However, because a complete color system can run into tens of thousands ofdollars -- for a Macintosh II with 8 Mbytes of RAM; a 19-inch dual-page,true-color display; removable mass storage; thermal color printer; 35mm slidescanner; and tabloid-size, 24-bit flatbed scanner -- the market for color hasbeen limited to graphic arts and print shop professionals who can justify thecost.andM;The big news for most users is that less-costly flatbed and handheld colorscanners now make it affordable and easy to incorporate full-range colorimages into Macintosh color applications, significantly broadening the marketfor this technology.andM;Jennifer Mitchell, a senior industry analyst at Dataquest in San Jose,Calif., said she expects that the color scanner market will expand beyond thecurrent installed base to include corporate publications.andM;&quot;Just as gray-scale scanners displaced single-bit scanners because they couldperform all monochrome functions, color scanners could make gray-scalescanners obsolete,&quot; Mitchell said.andP;  Her theory is based on the fact thatfalling prices make color scanners competitive with gray-scale units, whosefunctions color units also perform.andM;The applications with the most potential for color scanning are in-housepublications, slide presentations, animated presentations and trainingmaterials.andP;  On-screen HyperCard- and SuperCard-generated interactiveapplications can also take advantage of color scanning.andM;Presentation programs let users superimpose text, charts and graphs overcontinuous-tone images, so that they're able to take advantage of the realismand impact of color photographs.andP;  Demands on memory, display and storage canalso be less stringent for in-house programs than for publications.andO;Resolution needn't be as high, and eight-bit color, if automatically ditheredwhen translated from an original 24-bit scan, can appear photo-realistic.andO;All available software for flatbed scanners can save 24-bit images ineight-bit PICT2 or TIFF (tag image file format) RGB (red, green, blue) files.andM;On screen.andP;  Closely related to desktop presentation programs are applicationsthat center around on-screen display: pictorial databases, video productionand computer-aided animation.andP;  For these applications, a flatbed scanner is agood alternative to video boards and cameras.andP;  Since scanned images can beseveral times larger than videographed ones, static scenes can be animatedwith software that can simulate panning across the width of a full-colorphoto.andP;  And parts of images can be cut out as objects to be animated or aphoto could be the background for animated graphics.andM;Of course, capturing images from photographs with a scanner is generally aslower process than capturing them with a video camera and image captureboard.andM;Two available programs aimed at multimedia and on-screen presentation,MacroMind Director from MacroMind Inc. of San Francisco and San Diego-basedSilicon Beach Software's SuperCard, can import and display true-color scans.andO;On-screen display of presentations, animations and visual databases is theleast technically demanding application for color scans.andP;  Since a screencan't display more colors than it has pixels, true color is not critical whenscanned at 75 dpi and converted to eight-bit color for use in interactiveapplications, resulting in files that are typically fewer than 250 Kbytes insize.andM;Software shuffle.andP;  No matter how capable or affordable the new hardware, itis of little use without software to control it.andP;  But well-conceivedinterfaces are still a secondary consideration to developers of true-colorscanning software.andM;All color scanners come with software interfaces for the Macintosh.andP;  Thesoftware lets you specify the exact area to be scanned and to preset thebrightness, contrast and RGB balance.andP;  If the image has been scanned aseight-bit color (or gray scale) and saved as a TIFF or PICT2 file, it can beimported into virtually any Macintosh graphics or publishing program.andM;True-color, 24-bit files are another matter.andP;  Only a few Mac graphicsprograms that support 32-bit QuickDraw can be used to manipulate, enhance,retouch, print or separate the scanned images.andM;It's not always necessary to settle for the scanner software that comes withthe unit.andP;  ChromaScan, the software bundled with units sold directly by SharpElectronics of Mahwah, N.J., also works with the Sharp models sold by Howtekof Hudson, N.H., and New Image Technology Inc. of Lanham, Md., and can bepurchased separately for $195 from Imagenisis of San Antonio, Texas.andO;ChromaScan has a more Mac-like interface than the scanning software providedwith the Howtek and New Image units but doesn't write files larger thanmemory to disk.andM;There is yet another alternative to bundled scanner software.andP;  Some graphicsapplication programs, like PixelPaint Professional from Mountain View,Calif.-based SuperMac Technology, LaserPaint from LaserWare of San Rafael,Calif., and PhotoMac from Avalon Development Group of Marlborough, Mass.,andO;have built-in interfaces to the Sharp family of scanners, allowing you tobypass bundled software altogether.andP;  The most versatile of these programs isLaserPaint II.andP;  It's a multipurpose graphics program with powerful paint,draw, layout and &quot;darkroom&quot; capabilities.andP;  LaserPaint is the only programthat allows a true-color scanned image to be used as a tracing template forillustrations.andM;Electronic collages.andP;  Beyond scanner interface software are &quot;electronicdarkroom&quot; programs that users can employ to powerfully enhance the appearanceof an image.andP;  These programs are generally capable of controlling thecontrast and brightness of colors within selected areas, of seamlesslycollaging parts of scanned images into a new whole image and of recoloringall or part of an image without losing the shading that defines the picture.andO;The only such program now available is PhotoMac (designed by Data Translationbut distributed through Avalon Development).andP;  At least two other programshave been announced, but neither publisher has committed to a ship date:Mountain View, Calif.-based Adobe's PhotoShop (the consumer version ofBarneyScan XP, available only when purchased with that company's 35mm filmscanner) and Paramus, N.J.-based Letraset's ColorStudio.andM;For overpainting, retouching images and overlaying text, PixelPaintProfessional is the only 32-bit QuickDraw-compatible paint program now on themarket.andP;  Electronic Arts of San Mateo, Calif., has for the past yeardemonstrated a version of Studio/8 called Studio/32 at trade shows, but thecompany has not announced a ship date.andM;Outer limits.andP;  Assuming that you want to make full use of a color scanner'scapabilities, including that of creating full-page, 24-bit, 300-dpi images,it makes sense to know the limits of today's color-scanning hardware andsoftware.andP;  Among the most-significant limitations are the following:andM;* All color scanners except the forthcoming unit from Microtek of Torrance,Calif.andP;  (which uses the SCSI port), require NuBus cards.andP;  Unless it is runout of the SCSI port, an SE/30 color scanner interface would have to becombined with the video interface for the color monitor.andP;  ColorScan RGB fromStudiotronics of Winter Park, Fla., and Annapolis Md.-based Discovery'sChroma-32, since they are software-only solutions (see &quot;Affordable colorscanning,&quot; Page 84), can be used with any Mac connected to a gray-scalescanner.andM;* True-color scans are best viewed on a true-color display; otherwise, thepreviewing of continuous-tone images is compromised.andP;  Nevertheless, severalscanner and image manipulation programs will capture and store 24-bit fileseven on eight-bit systems.andP;  In that case, check to see that the software willautomatically display an eight-bit version.andM;* You need enough RAM to hold the screen image.andP;  The more RAM you have, thelarger the screen images and the more colors you can work with.andP;  Experiencedcolor scanner users recommend a minimum of 4 or 5 Mbytes.andM;* Have plenty of available (better yet, removable) hard disk space.andP;  An11-by-17-inch, 300-dpi, 24-bit scan will require up to 48 Mbytes.andP;  Mostscanner software will write the file to disk, even when you don't have thedisplay memory to show it all at once.andM;All available scanner software lets you choose (at a minimum) betweeneight-bit and 24-bit scans and allows for a choice of scanning resolutionsbetween 75 dpi and 300 dpi.andP;  Thus, you can predetermine your file size inaccordance with the needs of your application.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
