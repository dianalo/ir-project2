A federal appeals court Tuesday temporarily stayed pre-trialreview of North's plans to divulge classified information when hislawyers question high government officials in open court.   And the federal judge in the case, Gerhard A. Gesell, on Tuesdayturned down a request to further censor classified documentsprosecutors want to use as evidence to accommodate objections ofintelligence agencies.   The decision by the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals here toconsider North's motion to permanently bar Gesell from givingprosecutors a summary of the proposed defense testimony could forcea delay in the trial, now set for Jan. 31.   North is charged along with former national security adviser JohnM. Poindexter and arms dealers Albert Hakim and Richard V. Secordwith conspiring to illegally divert more than $14 million inU.S.-Iran arms-sale profits to the Nicaraguan rebels.   The three-judge appeals panel issued an indefinite``administrative stay'' of Gesell's plan to give independent counselLawrence E. Walsh the 162-page defense summary while it considerswhat the defense called ``grave constitutional issues'' involvingNorth's right to a fair trial.   Gesell, meanwhile, refused Walsh's request to make more editingchanges in the 300 prosecution exhibits.   U.S. intelligence agencies are concerned that sensitivereferences in the documents that cover some 3,000 pages coulddisclose covert operations or secret dealings with foreign nations.   A ranking administration official said it was too early to assessthe full impact of Gesell's ruling on the case against North.   But Gesell's latest decision was a fresh reminder that governmentrefusal to disclose certain classified information at trial couldscuttle major charges against the former White House aide.   Under the Classified Information Procedures Act, the attorneygeneral can decide to seek dismissal of criminal charges to preventdisclosure of secrets that might endanger national security.   The administration official, who spoke on condition of anonymity,said the decision did not spell the end of the case against Northbut it could bar Walsh from using some of the documents as evidence.   Gesell, for instance, is insisting that the names of Israel, Iranand the Central American nations appear in any document despite agovernment proposal to refer to each nation by a letter.   This procedure was used during the 1987 congressional Iran-Contrahearings, even though the true identities of the countries quicklybecame an open secret.   Gesell is known to have raised concerns at the CIA and otheragencies about his insistence that government reports be quotedverbatim with only a few modifications to protect sources andmethods of intelligence gathering.   Walsh's request for a modification of Gesell's Dec. 12 order wasfiled under court seal Dec. 22 after the independent counsel hadconferred with the White House and an interagency task force that isreviewing the classified information at issue.   North contends that Gesell's decision to let Walsh look at thesummary of his defense strategy will give prosecutors an unfairadvantage before the case goes to trial.   Lawyers for the former National Security Council aide describedthe document in court papers as ``a detailed road map to the defensecase.''   ``Never has a criminal defendant been compelled to disclose _before the prosecution has called its first witness _ the details ofproposed defense testimony on virtually every disputed factual issuein this case,'' the defense said in papers filed Tuesday.   Gesell had proposed to give Walsh the summary by Tuesdayafternoon, barring intervention from the appeals court. The casebefore Circuit Judges Kenneth Starr, James Buckley and DavidSentelle is one of several issues that could delay the proceeding.   Also looming on the horizon is North's attempt to subpoenaPresident Reagan and Vice President Bush to testify as witnesses.Justice Department officials said Tuesday that a motion to quash thesubpoenas could be filed by week's end.   The government is expected to resist the subpoenas based on theprinciple of separation of powers, executive privilege and the needto protect classified information.   North, meanwhile, has subpoenaed other administration officials,notably Secretary of State George Shultz and several of his topaides, including Assistant Secretary of State Elliott Abrams,Undersecretary Michael H. Armacost, legal adviser Abraham Sofaer andM. Charles Hill, Shultz's executive assistant.</TEXT></DOC>
