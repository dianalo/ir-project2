Conducting controlled laboratory shock tests on thesestructures provides essential data on their ability to survive theiroperational shock environments. Laboratory test specifications establishequivalence relationships between the actual shock environments and thelaboratory shock test inputs. In recent years the electrodynamic shakerhas proven itself to be a very versatile machine for applying transientsto aerospace components. Shaker control techniques now exist which allowreproduction of shock transients composed of summed deterministic functions(e.g., decaying sinusoids). This paper reports the results of a studyin which nonstationary random transients are used as the basis for definingshaker shocks. After describing the test specification and implementationprocedures, the paper compares the results of some tests conducted ona simple cantilever beam structure. One test is a direct simulation ofa nonstationary random process environment; two other tests representthe shock source using excitations established via the method of shockresponse spectra. The advantages and limitations of each approach aresummarized. 11 refs., 9 figs., 2 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
