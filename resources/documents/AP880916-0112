(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   PTL founder Jim Bakker says he doesn'thave the money to repay his former ministry's $52 million claimagainst him and others, but he says that doesn't matter because heplans to win the case.   U.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge Rufus Reynolds halted the trialThursday and scheduled it to resume Oct. 17. Reynolds said thatduring the interim he will read depositions from Bakker and others,and defense attorneys will prepare to respond to evidence presentedby PTL.   Attorneys for the Fort Mill-based ministry want Bakker, hiswife, Tammy, and former aide David Taggart to repay money they saywas lost through mismanagement of PTL accounts and grossly inflatedcompensation.   When asked outside the courthouse Thursday how he would pay ifhe lost the suit, Bakker responded: ``You can't get blood from aturnip. I don't intend to lose.''   The trial, which is being held without a jury, began Monday.   Bakker said in court Thursday that PTL attorneys and the IRSwere wrong about the amount of money he received.   ``I see figures on there (charts presented by PTL attorneys)that I can't recall at all, like in 1984, that $390,000 bonus, Ican't recall that at all,'' Bakker testified.   ``Looking at the charts in this room and the figures, and thosein the IRS preliminary report, compared to our research, shows somuch error that proper auditing and examining must be done toobtain the truth,'' he said.   He said he believes some financial records were destroyed afterhe left the ministry in March 1987 amid a sex and money scandal.   Last week, Bakker had claimed he had the financing to regainPTL, which Reynolds has ordered sold. PTL Trustee M.C. ``Red''Benton had called Bakker the leading bidder with a $172 millionoffer until Bakker could not prove he had the money.   Testifying in the Bankruptcy Court trial this week, Bakkercontradicted testimony that the board of directors never approvedhis salaries.   He said his salary was set by the board, which also approved hisraises. But earlier, former board member Charles H. Cookmantestified that the board ``never ruled on salaries.''   Peter Bailey, a former accountant and financial director at PTL,testified that he routinely warned Bakker of the financial troublesthe ministry was having. He said top executives received bonuses insome cases in anticipation of future donations, when there wasn'tmoney in the bank to cover the checks.   But Bakker attorney Ryan Hovis told Reynolds that the continuingfinancial crisis PTL experienced under Bakker's leadership was parfor the course.   ``Every ministry of this type in the nation had the same type offinancial crisis,'' Hovis said. ``It goes with the territory.''</TEXT></DOC>
