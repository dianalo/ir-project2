 But with emulation hardware and a custom interface, Macintosh systemscan cure the terminal condition.andP;  The combination allows in-house developersto add sophisticated graphical front ends to host software, which in turn canextend the ease, functional range and even the life span of mainframeapplications.andM;A variety of Macintosh-based programs can do the job.andP;  These includeMasquerade3270 from Elmsford, N.Y.-based Connectivite Corp.; SimMac 3.0 fromSimware Inc. of Ottawa; and MitemView from Mitem Corp. of San Jose, Calif.andM;With its ranks of Mac users rapidly swelling, the state of California isinvestigating an off-the-shelf Mac front end for its PROFS electronic-mailnetwork.andP;  The state has equipped several Macs with MacPROFF, aHyperCard-based application marketed by Avatar Corp. of Hopkinton, Mass.andM;&quot;MacPROFF adds value to PROFS,&quot; said Mary Liz Morgan, senior analyst at thestate's Teale Data Center in Sacramento.andP;  &quot;Users can cut text from a documentand paste it into a PROFS note without rekeying.andP;  In addition, MacPROFF letsyou scroll through a document,&quot; she said.andP;  &quot;To do the same with PROFS, youhave to 'page forward' a screen at a time, which is a slow keyboard activity.andO;Mac users are growing rapidly in our state government, and this is a fast wayto give them PROFS messaging with a Mac style.&quot;andM;Beyond E-mail.andP;  CSX Corp., based in Jacksonville, Fla., manages its vasttransportation net-work with custom applications running on IBM 3090 and DECVAX systems.andP;  CSX uses Mac front ends to handle an unusual mix of informationsources and multiple 3270 sessions.andM;&quot;We have hundreds of applications for our rail, truck and ship operations,and people use them in individual ways,&quot; said Joe Herrin, manager of PCdevelopment for CSX Technologies, a CSX business unit.andP;  &quot;Rather than buildinggraphical front ends for each 3270 application, we've created a tool thatlets end users and our Cobol programmers create their own.&quot;andM;The company's custom solution is CSXCEL, a high-level scripting languageoriginally written for IBM PCs and compatibles and ported to the Mac inApril.andP;  Some users have put it to work in simplifying interactive processessuch as logging on and database queries.andP;  Others have written intelligentscripts that retrieve and match data from several applications.andM;&quot;By making scripting easy, we've been able to build many of our users'efficiencies and shortcuts into our front ends,&quot; Herrin said.andP;  The approachsaves MIS costs and speeds application development.andP;  Moreover, &quot;users don'thave to deal with the technology of 3270 sessions,&quot; Herrin said.andP;  &quot;They'readding value without touching the mainframe application.&quot;andM;Distributed front end.andP;  Developers at GE Aerospace in King of Prussia, Pa.,andO;created a Mac front end for a complex host application used by severalhundred purchasing agents.andP;  GE's Mac-based buyers' workstation handles morethan 30 types of host transactions and provides some of the services of adistributed database.andP;  The equivalent of four full-time staffers created thepackage in less than five months using MitemView.andP;  Mitem's software couplesHyperCard with a proprietary technology for recognizing and sorting throughthe dizzying stream of data and commands that control 3270 terminals.andM;&quot;MIS developers are looking for quick hits,&quot; said Ron Therrien, programmanager at GE Aerospace.andP;  &quot;We want to achieve big gains in productivitywithout investing years in system development.andP;  Our front end speedspurchasing, yet it doesn't tie up programmers like a mainframe project.andO;Double-clicking on our Mac menu can invoke as many as 15 mainframetransactions,&quot; he said.andM;Therrien's team also has speeded response times by distributing databasestorage.andP;  Each time a user retrieves a new data set from the host, the Macstores the information locally.andP;  The next time the user wants the same data,the local disk automatically produces it.andM;Across all software.andP;  A large East Coast financial institution, which forcompetitive reasons asked not to be identified, has begun creating Mac frontends for virtually all its retail banking operations.andP;  The project willinvolve everything from teller-station applications to deposit and withdrawaltransaction journals.andM;The company's MIS developers are using Masquerade3270, software that replacesconventional programming with a palette-driven object-oriented design engine.andM;&quot;We're only at the early stages of replacing our 3270 terminals, but we canalready see the benefits of the Mac mentality,&quot; said the company's MISproject manager.andP;  &quot;The dropout rate for service representatives is highthroughout the banking industry.andP;  By unifying applications through onegraphical user interface, we should be able to get new people up to speed andreduce wear and tear on existing staff.andM;&quot;We can already see the payoff.andP;  Our text-based 3270 screens were boring, dryand kind of jarring; the graphical interface gives us a chance to regroupinformation in logical ways,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;With one of the old 3270applications, representatives were always asking supervisors for help indoing calculations.andP;  Now they're doing most of them on their own.&quot; n</TEXT></DOC>
