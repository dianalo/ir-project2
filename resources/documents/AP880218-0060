East Germany's state-run news agency ADN reported that SovietSS-12 missiles in Waren, an East German site northwest of Berlin,were dismantled, put in crates and were ready for transport back tothe Soviet Union.   The SS-12s are part of the U.S.-Soviet agreement last Decemberto eliminate medium-range and shorter-range missiles within threeyears. The treaty applies to nuclear missiles with a range of 300to 3,000 miles.   Hermann Scheer, disarmament expert for West Germany's oppositionSocial Democrats, told reporters that Kohl's government shouldrespond to the Soviet move with the early scrapping of WestGermany's 72 Pershing 1A missiles.   ``Such a reaction would be equal to developing trust indisarmament which the leadership in East Berlin has been workingtoward with the Soviets,'' Scheer said, speaking on behalf of theparty.   East German newspapers praised Soviet plans for early removal ofthe SS-12 missiles from Waren.   ``Soviet missile troops preparing withdrawal from the DDR (EastGermany). Troops in Waren dismantle medium-range rockets earlierthan expected,'' the Communist party's official newspaper, NewGermany, said in banner headlines Wednesday.   ADN did not say how many missiles had been dismantled or whenthey would be returned to the Soviet Union, only that Sovietsoldiers ``are making the last preparations to return their SS-12rockets.''   ``With this step we can make an important contribution towarddisarmament even before the treaty between the United States andthe Soviet Union is ratified,'' ADN said.   The East Berlin-based newspaper Berliner Zeitung said Wednesday:``Removal of missile troops from the DDR (East Germany) startsearlier than expected.''   President Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev signedthe superpower treaty in Washington last December. Kohl hadannounced beforehand that West Germany would scrap its Pershing 1Amissiles if a treaty was agreed upon.   West Germany owns the Pershing 1A missiles, but the UnitedStates controls the nuclear warheads for the rockets.   Three U.S. Senate committees are debating the treaty andratification may come this summer. The Supreme Soviet, the SovietUnion's parliament, is expected to approve the accord.   East German leader Erich Honecker said in January that Sovietintermediate-range rockets based in his country could be removedahead of schedule, but at the time he gave no specific timetable.   According to figures released after the treaty was signed, 22rockets, 12 launchers, nine transport vehicles and seven practicemissiles were stationed at the Waren site, which holds the largestnumbers of SS-12s in East Germany. There are three other SS-12rocket sites in the country.   The city of Waren is 90 miles northwest of Berlin.</TEXT></DOC>
