The deal to free the hostages fell through because thekidnappers made last-minute demands that the French negotiatorscould not meet, according to Syrian and Lebanese officials atBeirut Airport. Lebanese press reports said French officials hadrefused to pay ransom to the kidnappers.   The government of Prime Minister Jacques Chirac has been tryingto free the three men before the first round of French presidentialelections on Sunday. Such a release could boost the chances ofChirac, who is favored to oppose President Francois Mitterrand inthe final round of voting May 8.   A chartered Swiss executive jet carrying the four Frenchnegotiators left Beirut Saturday for an unknown destination,according to Beirut airport officials, who spoke on condition ofanonymity. Radio monitors in Cyprus reported they heard the pilotsay he was heading for Paris.   The arrival of the 12-seat Falcon 50 in Beirut from Larnaca,Cyprus, two hours earlier prompted speculation the release of thethree Frenchmen was imminent and that the jet had come to pick themup.   After a similar shuttle Friday, the plane's pilot, who would notgive his name, told reporters at Larnaca Airport: ``We went to getthe hostages, but there were no hostages ready.''   The three hostages are diplomats Marcel Fontaine and MarcelCarton and journalist Jean-Paul Kauffmann. Fontaine and Carton werekidnapped separately March 22, 1985, and Kauffmann was seized laterthat year on May 22.   A fourth Frenchman, Michel Seurat, a scientific researcher, waskidnapped with Kauffmann on May 22, 1985. Islamic Jihad, or Islamicholy war, which has claimed the abduction of all four, said onMarch 5, 1986, it had killed Seurat. Seurat's wife, Marie, saysFrench officials have confirmed her husband died in captivity.   Syrian and Lebanese officials said Friday the release of thethree other Frenchmen was expected within hours. Dozens ofjournalists rushed to a night-long vigil at the Summerland Hotel inBeirut, where two other French hostages were freed Nov. 27.   Voice of Lebanon Christian-run radio said a French negotiatortransmitted a new kidnappers' demand, which it did not detail, toParis Friday evening. However, the station reported that the Frenchgovernment was divided and gave no answer.   The conservative Ad-Diyar newspaper, based in Christian eastBeirut, said the kidnappers were demanding $28 million. It saidMitterrand opposed the ransom, although it would be paid by Frenchand Arab businessmen.   The other French hostages, Roger Auque and Jean-Louis Normandin,were freed in exchange for a French payment of $330 million on a $1billion loan owned to Tehran. It was made by the late Shah MohammedReza Pahlavi and frozen by the French after the 1979 Islamicrevolution in Iran.   The April 5 hijack of a Kuwait Airways jetliner by Shiiteextremists also apparently delayed the release of Carton, Fontaineand Kauffmann, intelligence sources have said.   In addition to the French captives, 18 other foreigners aremissing in Beirut. They are nine Americans, three Britons, a WestGerman, an Italian, an Irishman, an Indian and two unidentifiedforeign men.   The longest held is American Terry Anderson, The AssociatedPress' chief Middle East correspondent, who was kidnapped March 16,1985.</TEXT></DOC>
