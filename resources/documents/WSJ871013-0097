Tentatively called The European Daily, the English-language, five-day-a-week newspaper aims to be &quot;the voice of Europe,&quot; and would serve both a European and an American audience, Mr. Maxwell said at a press luncheon here. &quot;It's more than time that Europe told its story,&quot; he said.    Specifics of the planned venture are still vague, but Mr. Maxwell said he aims for a circulation of 200,000 copies. He said the paper would contain stories generated by a staff of correspondents throughout Europe as well as translations of &quot;outstanding&quot; articles from other European dailies.    Mr. Maxwell also said the paper would contain three pages of news on Eastern Europe, because East bloc countries are &quot;part and parcel of Europe, and we shall treat them as European.&quot;    The announcement is the latest in a series of international ventures Mr. Maxwell has been working on recently. Mr. Maxwell, who runs Mirror Group Newspapers Ltd. in Britain, which publishes the Daily Mirror and is a leading European printer and publisher, recently proposed publishing an English-language daily giving Japanese news to European and U.S. readers, in association with the Japanese paper Yomiuri Shimbun. Mr. Maxwell also has held talks with Soviet officials about publishing a similar paper on Soviet news.    Mr. Maxwell's most-recent newspaper venture failed spectacularly, however. Last February, he launched the London Daily News tabloid with great fanfare. The newspaper never caught on. Circulation fell from an initial 600,000 copies a day to fewer than 100,000. Mr. Maxwell closed the paper in July and never disclosed its financial losses.    The new European daily will be based in Paris, and will be styled after Gannett Co.'s USA Today, the popular, mass-circulation U.S. daily that publishes concise stories, color pictures and graphics, Mr. Maxwell said. &quot;Many newspapers in Europe specialize in writing long and boring articles,&quot; he said.    Mr. Maxwell said it was too early to tell how much the paper would cost or what its budget would be. But he said he had conducted a number of market studies and had concluded &quot;there's a profitable market there.&quot; Mr. Maxwell invited other European newspapers to join forces with him but said he would proceed with his plan even without other partners.    Some media sources, however, said they were skeptical about Mr. Maxwell's contentions that there is a market for his planned venture and that he has conducted advanced feasibility studies.    One source, who requested anonymity, noted striking similarities between Mr. Maxwell's plans and a plan put forward some time ago by former West German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt. Under Mr. Schmidt's plan, a number of European newspapers would pool their resources to publish a weekly paper that would give both U.S. and European readers a European viewpoint.    That paper, tentatively called The European Voice, would have its own staff of writers but would also adapt articles from European papers. An advanced feasibility study has been conducted, but a decision on publishing hasn't yet been reached because of questions on &quot;how big a market there is,&quot; the source said.    The source suggested that Mr. Maxwell announced his venture to forestall Mr. Schmidt's plan and based his decision on the feasibility study conducted for Mr. Schmidt's venture. He added that &quot;an English-language paper can only be a paper for the elite. What's the market for a USA Today-type paper?&quot;    But Gerry Long, an adviser to Mr. Maxwell, said that the similarities with Mr. Schmidt's plan were &quot;a pure coincidence.&quot; He said that Mr. Maxwell had been &quot;mulling over the idea for some time.&quot; He added that the planned venture isn't aimed at Mr. Schmidt's project, which he describes as &quot;something different.&quot;    Mr. Maxwell said the paper wouldn't compete directly with other daily English-language publications in Europe such as The Wall Street Journal/Europe, published by Dow Jones andamp; Co., which also publishes this newspaper; the International Herald Tribune, published by New York Times Co., Washington Post Co. and Whitney Communications Corp.; the Financial Times, published by Pearson PLC; or USA Today. He said those publications &quot;do a great job&quot; but serve special markets. </TEXT></DOC>
