The sing has taken place at Boksburg Lake, the main park in thisindustrial town east of Johannesburg, for four years, but thefar-right Conservative Party administration that just took over hasresegregated the park. The Boksburg Publicity Association said itcanceled the event because of that.   Conservatives won control of the Boksburg council and dozens ofothers in local elections Oct. 26. The Boksburg council voted torestore ``whites only'' status to the town hall, park and otherfacilities that were open to all races in recent years.   Anti-apartheid leaders, business groups and the governingNational Party denouced the action, and blacks have begun a consumerboycott of white-owned stores. Several government officials whocriticized the Conservatives come from cities where beaches,libraries and swimming pools are segregated.</TEXT></DOC>
