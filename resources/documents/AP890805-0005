There are changes that aretaking place around it,'' said Bob Sheets, director of the NationalHurricane Center in suburban Coral Gables.   At 10:30 p.m. EDT, Dean's winds of 85 mph were centered near23.0 north latitude and 64.91 west longitude, about 600 milessoutheast of Bermuda. The hurricane was moving north at about 12mph, forecasters said.   ``Our latest reconnaissance positions indicate that indeed itmay start a little bit more fast speed toward the north, and youcan see that on the satellite,'' Sheets said.   A weakening of upper atmosphere currents that steer the stormkept Dean away from the islands Thursday, after it initially headedtoward the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico.   The hurricane was moving very slowly.   ``We're still expecting it to turn to the north and theneventually go to the northeast,'' said forecaster Jim Gross. Askedabout the storm's potential for hitting Bermuda in about threedays, he said: ``They're very easy to miss.''   The second hurricane of the Atlantic season became a tropicalstorm Monday night and was reclassified a hurricane Tuesday whenits maximum sustained wind speed passed 74 mph.</TEXT></DOC>
