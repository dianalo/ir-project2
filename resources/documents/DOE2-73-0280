These activities, essentially six tasks, are examined inthe present report which also indicates the first results obtained duringthe period 1986 -1987. They concern: 1- Purification of tritium by cryosorptionon molecular sieves 2- Purification of tritium on metallic uranium beds3- Tritium storage on Lanthan-Nickel-Manganese alloys 4- Tritium storageon uranium 5- reweldability of tritium-helium implanted materials 6-corrosion of materials by tritiated water. Separate abstracts were preparedfor the 6 sections.</TEXT></DOC>
