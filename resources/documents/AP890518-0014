In the heart of the Volga River port, criminals with sawed-offshotguns murdered two policemen because they wanted their pistols.   Shocked residents of the metropolis 250 miles east of Moscow noware afraid to leave home at night or let their children stray fromsight.   ``In Gorky, people are afraid to go out,'' one newspaperreported. ``Even downtown, streets become deserted in theevening,'' another said.   For most Soviets, violent crime was once what they saw on TVreports about the United States, or in imported films. But no more.   Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reforms and loosened controls have notonly made Soviets better informed about crime at home _ they havesparked a surge in lawlessness itself, by the Kremlin leader's ownadmission.   ``From the very outset, we had to bear in mind that anyextension of democracy and humanization of life should go inparallel with an uncompromising struggle against criminalelements,'' Gorbachev told Communist Party leaders last month.``But party and government bodies, and also work collectives,permitted a slackening of attention to those issues.''   In the past week, the Soviet Union's police blotter has includedthese spectacular crimes, as reported by state-run media:   _ A police officer gone bad obtained entry to a bank in Armenia,and he and his confederates made off with the equivalent of about$330,000 after a cashier and three policemen died in a hail ofbullets. On learning of the corrupt policeman's crime, his mothercommitted suicide.   _ A criminal gang nicknamed ``The Jackals'' terrorized thecapital of Kazakhstan, Alma Ata. The chief of criminalinvestigators in the Central Asian republic says he has neverencountered such gruesome offenses in 30 years of police work. TheJackals reportedly befriended women, then raped and strangled them.   _ In the Siberian region of Omsk, two 20-year army deserters goon a crime spree and battle with police, firing at them with asubmachine gun. The outlaws are captured while asleep in a foresthideout.   For Soviets accustomed to hearing that crime was a product ofcapitalist exploitation and would disappear under socialism, suchreports _ now possible under Gorbachev's policy of greater openness_ are perplexing and frightening. Official statistics show thecountry's crime problem is getting worse.   According to Deputy Interior Minister N. Demidov, crimenationwide was up a staggering 31.2 percent for the first fourmonths of 1989, compared with the same period last year. Robberiesskyrocketed by 86.7 percent and burglaries increased by more thantwo-thirds, Demidov told the newspaper Trud last week.   More Soviets are now murdered every year by criminals than diedduring the entire nine years of Kremlin involvement in the Afghanwar, in which 15,000 soldiers were killed, Trud said.   In 1986, 20,610 Americans were murdered, according to FBIstatistics.   Showing high-level concern over the crime boom, the SovietInterior Ministry, which is in charge of police affairs, hascreated a department to combat lawlessness by fighting its causes,such as drug abuse, drinking and parasitism, the official Tass newsagency announced Tuesday.   The same day, a special party commission on legal matters,headed by former KGB chief Viktor M. Chebrikov, acknowledged ``thestate of public order in the country is deteriorating and thenumber of grave crimes is rising,'' and it recommended bettertraining for police, more specialization for detectives and a``single nationwide program for combatting crime.''   Firearms and offense committed with them are still far rarer inSoviet society than in the United States, but a poll published thisweek by the Moscow News weekly indicates the fear of crime is aswidespread among Soviet city dwellers as their U.S. counterparts.   In Moscow, 33 percent of those polled said they are afraid toventure out alone at night in the street where they live. That wasmore than in three of the four U.S. cities surveyed _ Boston,Detroit and San Francisco _ and was topped only by New York's 38percent, according to the survey, conducted in part by theInstitute of Sociology of the Soviet Academy of Sciences.   One crime surge can be directly traced to Gorbachev's reforms:extortion. The number of potential prey for racketeers hasburgeoned since the government began promoting the spread ofcooperatives, a move that has put more money into private hands.   Pravda, the Communist Party daily, reported cooperative workerswere ``making guns and bombs right at work'' to protect themselvesfrom shakedowns, and said their cry had become: ``I'm buying agun.''   In Gorky, a city of 1.5 million where the policemen were slainin February, authorities settled on officially sponsoredvigilantism as one way to fight a 75 percent increase in seriouscrime, creating ``emergency commissions'' headed by local partychiefs and ``workers' militias.''   Workers are sent by their factories to work with police for ayear or more, and the enterprises pay their normal salaries andeven buy their police uniforms, the daily Sovietskaya Rossiyareported.   Yulian Semenov, a writer of thrillers who often has made CIAagents his villains, told the Literary Gazette weekly that speed isessential in fighting lawlessness.   ``If we go slowly, the streets of Moscow, Leningrad and otherbig cities soon will start to resemble New York's, not by thequantity of cars, goods in the stores or choice of restaurants, butby the number of criminals, drug addicts and prostitutes,'' thewriter said.</TEXT></DOC>
