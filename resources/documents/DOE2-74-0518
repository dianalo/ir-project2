However, these surface protection resins haveshown a big reflection loss due to its low refraction factor, its hardnesshas not been sufficiently high and its manufacturing yield has been bad.In view of the above, with regard to the above cell module, this inventionproposes to make the surface protection film, which is composed on theside of incidence of the light, of a diamond thin film. The inventionstates that because of the above, a surface protection film with a smalllight reflection loss, high hardness and good environment resistancecan be obtained. (2 figs)</TEXT></DOC>
