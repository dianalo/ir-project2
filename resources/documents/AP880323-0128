Politics and politicians have picked up rotten reputations. Thatstems partly from the Watergate era, the trauma of the Vietnam eraand various investigations and charges against public officials.   And it results in part from journalists' digging, reporting andcommentary on those cases.   Lots of potentially strong public officials want to avoidputting themselves and their families in the glare of publicity.</TEXT><TEXT>   March 18   The Seattle Post-Intelligencer on Iran-Contra indictments:   The indictments of the principals in the Iran-Contra affair areheartening evidence that the judicial system is working properly.   This is a country based on the rule of law. Democracy cannotsurvive if it accommodates those who put themselves above the law.Corruption in government, even for an avowed noble purpose, cannotbe tolerated.   That's why those charged should stand trial to have their guiltor innocence determined. ...   It should be kept in mind in the months ahead that at issue hereis not the political question of what ought to be the proper roleof the United States in Nicaragua. The question is whether thesemen broke the law.   Obtaining a judicial answer to this question is important forthe spiritual health of the country, which depends on the faith ofits citizens in the rule of law.</TEXT><TEXT>   March 21   The Baltimore Sun on Iran-Contra pardons:   Shredders, obstruction of justice, contempt for routinegovernmental and political processes, lots of money, colorfulcharacters, White House involvement, special prosecutor, multipleindictments. ...   If it all sounds familiar, that's because it is. The Iran-Contraaffair is a repeat in many ways of the Watergate scandal of the1970s. ...   Just as in Watergate, the question of pardons is central to theoutcome of this drama.   As a general rule, we don't believe pardons ought to be grantedor even discussed before guilt or innocence has been established inthe courts. But the general rule doesn't apply here. The questionof pardons needs some public discussion.   The guilt or innocence of Adm. John Poindexter, Lt. Col. OliverNorth, General Richard Secord and Albert Hakim probably cannot bedecided until after President Reagan leaves office. ...   Reagan should not pardon these men before trial, even though hesympathizes with them and had a lot to do with their troubles.</TEXT><TEXT>   March 18   The Record, Hackensack, N.J., on sending U.S. troops intoHonduras:   President Reagan's emergency airlift of 3,200 troops in responseto a supposed Nicaraguan incursion into Honduras is an example ofan administration driven to desperation as a result of itsinability to win additional aid for the Contras.   At best, the airlift is a splashy way of stampeding Congressinto voting the rebels additional military aid. If so, it wouldseem to run counter to the prevailing viewpoint of most Americansas well as Congress.   The plain fact is that the White House's Nicaraguan policy hasfailed, the victim of scandals, ineptitude and miscalculation, andit will take more than a war scare to bring it back to life.   Instead of a military drive, this seemed to be a time forholding the line, and reducing to a minimun the chances of addedhostilities.</TEXT><TEXT>   March 17   Charleston (W.Va.) Daily Mail on mandatory use of seat belts:   The (West Virginia) Legislature has made the use of seat beltsmandatory. It's the wrong idea, done the wrong way for the wrongreason.   Yes, everyone should wear seat belts when driving. But it isoutrageous to have government decree such behavior.   First, there's the approach itself. Lawmakers are using anotherone of those rankling $25 fines to get their way.   A more appropriate method would be to lower the amount ofdamages that juries award injured parties who were not wearing seatbelts when they were involved in an accident.   The motive was also wrong. Lawmakers were pushed to pass thebill on grounds that it would help stop the U.S. Department ofTransportation from requiring air bags on cars.   Ironically, West Virginia's law contains exemptions which keepit from complying with the federal criteria for such laws.   The state's new seat belt law may make lawmakers feel good. Butas a practical piece of legislation, it's a dismal failure.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
