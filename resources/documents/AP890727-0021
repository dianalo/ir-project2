The report presented to Congress on Wednesday by the InsuranceInstitute for Highway Safety concludes that 550 of the 2,485 deathson rural interstate highways last year were caused by the 65 mphlimit.   A federal highway official also said higher speeds on 65 mphroads may be causing more deaths, but a spokesman for a motorists'group said 1988 fatality statistics are being misinterpreted.   Actual 1988 deaths on rural interstates increased 34 percentover the 1982-86 average in 38 states that raised the speed limitto 65 mph in 1987, Brian O'Neill, insurance institute president,told a House transportation subcommittee.   The institute concluded, by comparing the data with fatalityfigures on all roads, that 550 of the 1988 deaths werestatistically due to the higher speed limit. That represents a 30percent increase over the 1982-86 average, with the other 4 percentdue to other factors.   The 65 mph limit has been adopted by 40 states, with Virginiaand Georgia excluded from the institute study because theyincreased speeds only last year. No state-by-state analysis offatalities was provided.   Fatalities on all highways increased only 1.5 percent last year.Interstate accidents caused about 6 percent of the 47,479 roaddeaths, according to Transportation Department figures.   Will Fox, spokesman for Citizens for Rational Traffic Laws ofDane, Wis., told reporters after the hearing that higher speeds donot kill more people. He said the fatality statistics aremisleading because they do not factor in the number of milestraveled.   The group, which said it represents 15,000 ``serious andknowledgeable motorists,'' called the 65 mph limit ``the first stepin restoring credibility and respect for posted speed limits.''   O'Neill, in the insurance institute report, said car ads imply``speeding is fun and has no consequences.''   He criticized ads for the Porsche 928S, which describe it as``an attractive alternative to air travel,'' Acura which says itscars' interiors are ``designed at 125 mph,'' and Subaru, whichadvises potential buyers to ``catch us doing '90,'' which O'Neillsaid is a double reference to the model year and to speed.   ``Muscle cars just aren't compatible with safety,'' O'Neill saidin his report.   He said evidence shows that because of the 65 mph limit, moremotorists are driving at 70, 75 and even 80 mph or higher.   ``It's true that speeding isn't as rampant now as it was in thewaning months of the 55 mph,'' O'Neill acknowledged, ``but peoplearen't automatically abiding by 65, either.''   Proponents of the 65 mph limit said it would decrease the numberof drivers breaking speeding laws.   Jeffrey R. Miller, acting head of the National Highway TrafficSafety Administration, said 1988 traffic fatalities are still beingstudied and NHTSA will issue its second report on the 65 mph speedlimit in September. The first in January was inconclusive.   Miller said fatalities on all rural interstates were 13 percenthigher than in 1987, which he described as ``statisticallysignificant.''   ``The overall pattern of the last two years suggests that anincrease in actual speeds on the 65 mph highways may becontributing to the increase in fatalities,'' he said.   However, in a statement submitted with Miller's testimony, theagency said that until the September study is released, ``it wouldbe premature to reach a definitive conclusion on the safety effectsof the 65 mph speed limit.''</TEXT></DOC>
