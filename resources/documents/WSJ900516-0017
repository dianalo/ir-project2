Nikon Corp. of Japan had expressed interest inPerkin-Elmer's so-called optical lithography technology, usedto produce semiconductors. Nikon's move drew fire from U.S.semiconductor companies because of fears that U.S. makers ofchip-production equipment are dying off or are being boughtup by their overseas competition, especially the Japanese.That could mean U.S. semiconductor makers would wind upbuying equipment from their overseas competitors, worseningthe U.S. industry's already precarious position. Whileindustry executives have said the likelihood of a sale of thePerkin-Elmer business to the Japanese was overstated, theysaid the concerns are legitimate.</LP><TEXT>   Yesterday's announcement illustrates the sorts of jointefforts that U.S. companies apparently are prepared to enterinto in coming years as they try to keep the U.S.semiconductor-equipment business alive.   Silicon Valley Group Inc., a small company based in SanJose, Calif., bought a two-thirds interest in the business,which Perkin-Elmer has been trying to sell for more than ayear. International Business Machines Corp. will also have anequity interest in the business, which will be renamed SVGLithography Systems Inc. Perkin-Elmer, Norwalk, Conn., willretain slightly less than a 20% stake. The value of thetransaction was not disclosed.   IBM, Armonk, N.Y., has promised to invest heavily in thebusiness's research and development in return for earlyaccess to the results. Sematech, a group of U.S. companiesand the government, has also entered into a joint developmentagreement with SVG.   In addition, IBM has pledged to buy a substantial amountof the equipment, which uses the optical-lithographytechniques.   Some semiconductor makers have reservations about thetechnology. While it is useful for making larger chips, theysay, it is more expensive and less efficient than othersystems for almost all types of chips now in use.   Jack Kuehler, president of IBM, believes the Perkin-Elmeroptical-lithography technology will become very important inthe next generation of semiconductors. He said the devices,called Micrascans, can use ultraviolet light, with its shortwavelengths, to etch extremely thin lines on silicon wafers.Mr. Kuehler said the Micrascans can also expose largersegments of a wafer at one time than can systems now in wideuse, allowing for the production of larger chips and forfaster production of chips.</TEXT></DOC>
