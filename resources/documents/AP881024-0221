(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A fight over Kraft Inc. began today as thefood maker turned down a $11 billion takeover bid from PhilipMorris Cos. and said it would undertake a $13.59 billionrecapitalization plan.   The Kraft proposal would be the largest corporate restructuringever, would force Kraft to sell off some lines, and would boost thecompany's debt more than tenfold.   ``We should take action to maximize shareholder value ratherthan accept an inadequate offer,'' said Kraft Chairman and ChiefExecutive John M. Richman in a statement released late Sunday. ``Westrongly believe the $90 takeover bid (by Philip Morris) ...undervalues Kraft.''   Richman said the recapitalization plan would have asignificantly higher value for shareholders by boosting the valueof the company's stock to $110 per share.   Philip Morris spokesman Tom Ricke, reached by telephone in NewYork late Sunday, said he could not immediately comment on the moveby Kraft.   But it was expected the tobacco and food products company, whichhas an excess of cash on hand, would answer Kraft with a higher bid.   Philip Morris indicated last week it was ready for a fight,filing a lawsuit in U.S. District Court in Chicago challengingKraft's ``poison pill'' anti-takeover defense. The pill makes ahostile takeover prohibitively expensive.   The Kraft recapitalization would include a distribution in cashand securities of about $98 per share and retention of common stockinterest, Richman said. The market would determine the value ofKraft stock after the distribution, he said.   Kraft stock closed at $92 a share in New York Stock Exchangecomposite trading on Friday.   Philip Morris offered a week ago to buy Kraft for $90 a share incash for each of Kraft's nearly 123.6 million shares outstanding,or a total of about $11 billion.   The Kraft recapitalization plan, at $110 a share, values thecompany at about $13.59 billion.   That Kraft stock rose above the $90 offer is ``a clear signalthat investors see the (Philip Morris) bid as low,'' Richman said.   Richman said the recapitalization plan would be presented to thecompany's board of directors soon, and then would be submitted tostockholders at a special meeting.   He said the plan would involve selling some Kraft businesses,but that core brands representing about 80 percent of the company'sprofits would be kept.   The plan also involves bank borrowings of more than $6.8 billionand the public sale of some $3 billion of debt. Kraft has alreadybegun negotiations on some of the transactions, and Goldman, Sachsand Co. has said it is confident it can place the debt, Kraft said.   While Richman said the company would proceed with therecapitalization, he left open the possibility that the board couldaccept another bid.   ``If someone comes forward with a transaction that would be moredesirable than the restructuring plan, we will negotiate and yourboard will give full consideration to such a transaction,'' Richmansaid.   The New York Times reported last week the leveraged buyoutspecialist Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co. might be offering itsservices to Kraft management.   Sources quoted by the Times said Kohlberg Kravis was financiallycapable of competing against Philip Morris. However, today KohlbergKravis took on an even bigger deal, announcing it would begin atender offer of more than $20 billion for RJR Nabisco Inc.   A combination of Kraft and Philip Morris would create theworld's largest maker of consumer goods and would decrease PhilipMorris' heavy dependence on profitable but stagnating cigarettesales.   Philip Morris, best known for Marlboro, Virginia Slims, Benson andamp;Hedges and Merit cigarettes, took over General Foods Corp., themaker of Jell-O, Maxwell House, Kool-Aid, Shake 'N Bake and OscarMayer, in 1985 for $5.7 billion.   The addition of Kraft would bring such names as Velveeta,Thousand Island dressings, Cheez Whiz, Breyer's, Light 'n' Lively,Sealtest and Frusen Gladje to the Philip Morris lineup.</TEXT></DOC>
