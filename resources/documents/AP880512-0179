Representatives of ABC, CBS and NBC told the Senate RulesCommittee they will make permanent their commitment to avoid earlycalling of state races if legislation is approved to have all pollsin the continental United States close at 9 p.m. EST.   Sen. Brock Adams, D-Wash., who conducted the hearing and is astrong supporter of the Senate legislation, drew the commitmentfrom Thomas Ross, senior vice president for news at NBC; GeorgeWatson, vice president and Washington bureau chief of CapitalCity-ABC News, and Warren Mitofsky, vice president, election andsurvey unit, CBS News.   Adams and Rep. Al Swift, D-Wash., said, however, that thenetworks had made the commitment previously but that NBC hadviolated it during the New York Democratic presidential primary.   Swift, who helped push a uniform-closing-time bill through theHouse in November, showed the committee a videotape of the threenetworks during the New York primary. In it, NBC said exit pollsindicated Michael Dukakis could be a big winner over Jesse Jackson,even though many of the state's polling places were still open.   ``I can assure you that it was an inadvertent aberration and itwill not occur again,'' said Ross.   In 1984, Adams said, all three networks had declared PresidentReagan's re-election by 5:30 p.m. PST.   ``At that point, only 3 percent of the vote had been tallied andpolls in 26 states were still open,'' said Adams. ``There issomething wrong when voters in Walla Walla or Boise do not feeltheir votes have the same impact as that of voters in Charleston orProvidence.''   Under the legislation, polls would close at 9 p.m. in theEastern time zone, 8 p.m. in the Central time zone and 7 p.m. inthe Mountain time zone.   In the Pacific time zone, daylight saving time would be extendeduntil the Sunday after Election Day. This provision, affectingCalifornia, Nevada, Oregon, Washington and the Idaho panhandle,would permit a 7 p.m. local-time poll closing simultaneous with 9p.m. EST.   Alaska and Hawaii would not be affected by the measure, whichthe House approved 208-109 on Nov. 10.   Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, ranking committee Republican,expressed concern that the two states not in the continental UnitedStates would be exempt.   ``I'm not going to upset the agreement,'' said Stevens, who hassought uniform-poll-closing legislation since 1971, ``but I willlook into this to see if we can get the off-shore states involved.''   When Stevens asked if the networks would withhold declaring apresidential winner until the polls close in Alaska and Hawaii,each of the representatives shook his head in the negative.   ``We have believed for a long time that when the polls close ina given state, we should report what we know about what happened inthat state,'' said Watson.   ``I don't think we're prepared to withhold any information afterthe polls close (in the continental United States).''   James E. Landry, senior vice president and general counsel ofthe Air Transport Association of America, which represents most ofthe scheduled airlines, and James C. Benfield, executive directorof the Daylight Saving Time Coalition, testified that they opposepassage of the legislation.   Landry said the changing of daylight saving time on the WestCoast for two weeks every four years would disrupt airlineschedules, affect overnight service standards and result in thedeterioration of quick deliveries.</TEXT></DOC>
