The president again denied knowing that profits from the Iran arms sales were diverted to Nicaraguan rebels, or Contras. Asked whether he knew White House aides were directing private aid to the Contras, he acknowledged only that he knew private individuals and groups were aiding the insurgents after Congress cut off U.S. aid to them in 1984. &quot;I don't believe it was counter to any law,&quot; Mr. Reagan said.    The president's performance was in sharp contrast to his previous news conference Nov. 19, during which he appeared defensive and unfamiliar with the details of his own Iran policy. During that earlier session, Mr. Reagan repeatedly denied that the U.S. had condoned Israeli arms sales to Iran in 1985, but aides issued a correction minutes after the news conference ended. Last night, Mr. Reagan said that he simply had misspoken and that he immediately had directed his aides to set the record straight.    Asked why he initially told reporters there was &quot;no foundation&quot; to a report that the U.S. had secretly sold arms to Iran, the president said he was trying to save the lives of the American hostages in Lebanon and Iranian middlemen whom he believed were helping to free them. At the time, Mr. Reagan said, he believed two more hostages were about to be released.    &quot;I'm not going to tell falsehoods to the American people,&quot; he said. &quot;I'll leave that to others.&quot;    On several occasions, however, the president appeared to contradict both Vice President George Bush and his own commission that investigated the Iran-Contra affair.    Asked whether Mr. Bush had advised against the Iran policy, Mr. Reagan said, &quot;No.&quot; Mr. Bush, on a campaign trip to Michigan last month, told reporters that he had &quot;expressed reservations&quot; about the Iran arms policy to &quot;key players&quot; in the administration.    Mr. Bush's press secretary Steve Hart last night said the president's statement didn't contradict Mr. Bush's February comments. Mr. Hart pointed out that Mr. Bush has said on several occasions that he supported the Iran policy. Mr. Hart wouldn't comment on how that support, or the president's comments, squared with the &quot;reservations&quot; Mr. Bush has said he expressed.    Although the commission, headed by former Sen. John Tower (R., Texas), reported that the Iranians had paid far more than market value for U.S. TOW anti-tank missiles, Mr. Reagan said the U.S. &quot;asked for $12 million, which was the cost -- no profit -- on those weapons.&quot;    The Tower Commission also reported that former National Security Adviser Robert McFarlane testified that Mr. Reagan had given advance approval for Israeli arms sales to Iran in an August 1985 telephone call. Last night, Mr. Reagan said he didn't think he'd approved the sales in a phone call. Erroneously recalling Mr. McFarlane's testimony, Mr. Reagan last night said his former aide had testified that the approval was given during a meeting at Bethesda Naval Hospital, following the president's colon cancer surgery in July 1985.    The Tower Commission also reported that the president changed his account of whether he approved the Israeli sales in advance, first saying he did and later saying he didn't recall doing so. Last night, Mr. Reagan said he did approve the sales, but couldn't remember when.    But when he was asked whether he also could have forgotten that he was told funds from the Iran arms sales were being diverted to the Contras, he replied: &quot;Oh no. You would have heard me from -- without opening the door to the office -- if I had been told that at any time. No. And I still do not have the answer to that money.&quot;    The president declined to say whether he thought former National Security Adviser John Poindexter and former National Security Council aide Oliver North had deceived him by secretly funneling military aid to the Contras. &quot;I don't know . . . I want to get to the bottom of this and find out all that has happened,&quot; he said.    But he defended his hands-off management, which the Tower board criticized. &quot;I think that most people in business would agree that it is a proper management style,&quot; Mr. Reagan said. &quot;You get the best people you can to do a job. Then you don't hang over their shoulder. . . . The only time you move is if there's incontrovertible evidence that they are not following policy, or they have gone down a road where they are not achieving what we want.&quot;    Earlier yesterday, it was disclosed that shortly before he tried to commit suicide last month, Mr. McFarlane wrote letters to his lawyer, Leonard Garment, and to three lawmakers, asserting that the Saudi Arabian ambassador to the U.S. secretly offered to give $1 million a month to the Nicaraguan rebels in 1984.    Mr. McFarlane revealed the offer, but not who made it, in written testimony last month to the Tower Commission, which told of the offer in its report. Bank records made public this month by Contra leader Adolfo Calero show the insurgents received $1 million a month from a Swiss bank account between July 6, 1984, and Feb. 7, 1985, and a further $24 million between Feb. 27 and March 25, 1985.    Saudi Ambassador Bandar bin Sultan has denied that he or any other Saudi has offered aid to the Contras. The existence of the letters was disclosed yesterday in the Washington Post and confirmed by Mr. Garment. </TEXT></DOC>
