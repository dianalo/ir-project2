Boucher spoke after a Cuban war hero and three colleagues wereexecuted for shipping tons of drugs to the United States.   Boucher said the Bush administration did not have access to allthe evidence in the case and therefore cannot make a judgment aboutthe executions.   ``With regard to policy, we, of course, support vigorousprosecution of alleged drug traffickers whoever they may be,'' hesaid.   Castro has suggested U.S.-Cuban cooperation to halt drugtrafficking, but State Department officials said they believe itspossible the Cuban leader has known all along about current and pastuse of Cuban territory for narcotics shipments.   Castro said the drug probe that led to Thursday's executionsbegan in March after U.S. authorities arrested two traffickers whosaid they used Cuba as a transit point for smuggling cocaine fromColombia.   Another reason for U.S. caution in responding to Castro's offer,officials said, is that they don't want to create with Cuba the samekind of situation they have faced with Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega,head of Panama's Defense Forces.   Noriega, they said, has cracked down from time to time on hisadversaries in the drug-smuggling business, winning praise from theDrug Enforcement Administration while allegedly engaging in aidingdrug shipments himself.   Noriega has been under indictment in Florida since February 1988for drug-related offenses.   The cautious U.S. stand has been criticized by Rep. CharlesRangel, D-N.Y., chairman of the Select Committee on Narcotics. Hehas said the administration is squandering an opportunity to strikea blow against drug traffickers.   But Boucher said the administration has had information linkingCuba to narcotics smuggling since 1982 and had expressed itsconcerns since then.   ``Three federal indictments implicating Cuba in drug trade havebeen handed down since 1982,'' he said. ``Two of the cases havedisclosed detailed allegations of Cuban officials' complicity in thedrug trade, which to the best of our knowledge have not beeninvestigated by the Cuban government.''   Until the recent arrests, Cuba rejected allegations that anyCuban officials were involved in drug trafficking, Boucher said.</TEXT></DOC>
