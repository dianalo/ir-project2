Catalysts containing either acombination of CO, Ni, and Mo as the active metal components or Pd asthe active metal componet were tested with representative hydrotreaterfeed stocks from the Wilsonville Advanced Coal Liquefaction Researchand Development Facility. Catalyst performance evaluation was based ondesulfurization and denitrogenation activity, the conversion of cyclohexane-insolbulematerial, and hydrogenation activity during 100-hour reactor runs. Resultsindicated that the HTO catalysts were comparable to a commercial Ni/Mo-aluminasupported catalyst in the areas evaluated. 11 refs., 1 fig., 6 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
