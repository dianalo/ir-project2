The company's Texaco USA subsidiary was charged, along with aformer oil rig supervisor and a drilling contractor, with delayingfor two days a required weekly test of a device that prevents deadlyblowouts of pressurized natural gas during drilling.   ``This certainly signals our commitment to see that offshoredrilling operations are conducted safely and legally,'' saidAssistant U.S. Attorney Janet Goldstein, a member of the JusticeDepartment's environmental crime section who is prosecuting the case.   It is the first criminal prosecution under provisions of theoffshore drilling act that took effect in 1978, she said.   No accident or other damage took place because of the testingdelays at the company's Platform Harvest off the California coast inDecember 1986, Texaco said. The company blamed the violations on thesupervisor, who was fired.   A criminal complaint filed in U.S. District Court charges Texacowith two counts of violating the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act _one count for each day the test was delayed.   Robert R. Brogdin, 48, of Bakersfield, a former supervisor on theplatform 11 miles off Point Conception, also was charged with twocounts of violating the act.   Texaco, which could be fined up to $1 million, agreed to pay$750,000 in a plea bargain filed simultaneously with the charges.Brogdin, who could be imprisoned for 20 years and fined $500,000,also pleaded guilty but prosecutors didn't make a sentencingrecommendation.   In a separate indictment returned Wednesday by a federal grandjury, the contractor, Helmerich andamp; Payne International Drilling Co.of Tulsa, Okla., was charged with six counts of violating the act,said Ms. Goldstein. Two counts concern the delayed test and fourother counts stem from alleged falsification of documents on earliertests of the blowout preventer.   The company, which also has a Ventura office, declined tonegotiate a plea, she said.   Calls to Helmerich andamp; Payne's California office Wednesday eveningrang unanswered and an employee who answered the phone in Tulsarefused to call a spokesman at home. Brogdin isn't listed in theBakersfield directory.   Blowouts occur during drilling when equipment cannot containpressurized natural gas that is found along with oil deposits underthe seabed. A blowout would imperil the oil rig crew and could causean environmentally disastrous spill, Ms. Goldstein said.   According to Texaco, Brogdin allowed Helmerich andamp; Payne to delaytests of the blowout preventer Dec. 29 and 30, 1986, because of anequipment problem. Tests are required every seven days under thedrilling act, which is administered by the Interior Department'sMinerals Management Service.   Higher Texaco officials learned of the violations Jan. 6, 1987and fired Brogdin 10 days later, said Robert Hammond, a spokesman inthe company's Universal City office.   Investigations by the Minerals Management Service and the JusticeDepartment support Texaco's contention that it didn't condone suchbehavior, Hammond said.   The platform is off Point Conception, 125 miles north of LosAngeles.</TEXT></DOC>
