He said more than 24,0000 of the guerrillas, known as Contras,have fled across the border into Honduran camps since April _ afigure Honduran officials say includes 11,000 rebels and 13,000civilians. An estimated 2,000 rebels remain inside Nicaragua.   ``The lack of democracy by the Sandinistas is paid for byHonduras, which is a victim of the Central American problem,''Azcona Hoyo said Wednesday. ``It is necessary to strengthen thestruggle to democratize Nicaragua.''   Azcona Hoyo said the leftist Sandinistas ``deliberately liftedprotection of their border to allow the Contras to move intoHonduras.''   Other estimates say the number of Contras in Honduras whoreceive food, medicine, clothing and other non-lethal U.S. aidtotals 14,000 _ including 9,000 rebels and 5,000 civilians. Theexodus began in April, after Nicaraguan government forces withdrewfrom two northern border areas under a March 23 peace plan.   The United States, which has supplied and trained the rebelssince 1981, cut off military aid to the Contras at the end ofFebruary. Congress has refused to renew the funding, saying itwould violate a cease-fire the two sides have agreed to.   However, Congress earmarked $17 million in non-lethal aid to therebels _ supplied on condition that it go to Honduras, notNicaragua. The supplies began arriving in April and are beingdistributed by the Agency for International Development.</TEXT></DOC>
