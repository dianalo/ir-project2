Thefirst type of cogeneration includes the very large facilities which sellthe majority of their electrical output to an electric utility. The secondtype of cogeneration facility is one which is located at a large industrialfacility where the total cogeneration plant output-both electrical andthermal-is consumed totally by the local industrial processes. Theremay be some small selloff of electricity to the local utility as a load-balancingtechnique but, in general, the facility is built to provide only theenergy needs of that specific site. The third type of cogeneration plantconsists of those which may be located in commercial applications suchas large hotels, airports, hospitals, and universities. Again, theseplants are typically designed so that all of the output is consumed locallyalthough in some cases there has been some selloff of electricity tothe local electric utility. This chapter describes and discusses thedevelopment of large and small cogeneration projects.</TEXT></DOC>
