In the FRG it has been found thatraising the initial temperature from 1000 to 1200 degree C and increasingthe compressed air ratio from 10-16 increases the efficiency of a gasturbine plant from 32 to 35% and increases its specific power from 250to 380 kJ/kg of air and as a result the unit power of the plant risesto over 200 MW. The Vega series of steam-gas plants in use in Franceranges from 37-240 MW. Although the majority currently uses light liquidfuel, modern preparation systems mean that Vega plants can also processheavy liquid fuel. A 900 MW computer-controlled Vega-209E plant has beeninstalled in Malaysia by a French-Japanese consortium, and Brown Boverihas installed 500 and 540 MW power plants in the Netherlands and Bahrain.In general, plants with intracycle coal gasification are preferable toconventional steam power plants as they consume less fuel and water,have better power utilization, emit fewer harmful substances into theatmosphere and are quicker to construct. 11 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
