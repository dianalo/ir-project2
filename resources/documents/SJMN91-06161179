Look for the purple hat.&quot;;    &quot;There he is -- right outfront, dragging Wah (his Wild Thing from the Sendak story).&quot;;    Good -- notears; he looked happy, even. Now for Andrew.;    I needn't have worried abouthim. He was content anywhere he went on this trip as long as he had his newshark squirt gun with him.;    From the start, we were lucky; our boys didgreat in their Kid Clubs. Within a few days Daniel was calling the Baby Clubleader, Ileana, &quot;Nana&quot; and had adapted to siesta country with close tothree-hour naps. His worst problem was dealing with a soggy Wah that got tooclose to the pool one day.;    Andrew and the other 3-year-olds, in additionto morning rituals at the pool and beach, were doing cool things like stalkingiguanas (they were everywhere -- his group was even called the Iguanas) racingkiddie cars and going on treasure hunts. Oh, and watching videos. Given thechoice, more often than not he voted to join his group. Mom and Dad or PeterPan? No contest.;    Which left Mom and Dad the rare opportunity to a) sit bythe pool and actually get through more than two pages of a book (Mom); b) swimlaps (Dad); c) finish meals without any little hands and faces to scour(both); and d) occasionally, do nothing at all (again, both).;    We even gotthe chance to escape the busy buffet-style main restaurant for two quietdinners on our own, once at the beachfront, reservation-only Bistrot, whereexcellent beef or seafood dinners were served, and once sitting on the beachitself with take-out plates from the restaurant. (Happily, the staff seemedeager to have guests take food out; disposable plates and utensils were alwayson hand.);    All this is not to say we never saw our children; our routinewas breakfast together, Kids Clubs through lunch and naps, then an afternoonat the beach or pool. Parents supervised dinner at the kid restaurants for thelittle ones, so Scott and I each took a boy at 6:30, then left them at theirclubs just long enough for us to have a civilized dinner. Bedtime followed thesame ritual we had at home, albeit a bit later.;    At the end of a week Scottand I felt we had gotten the break we needed, without sacrificing the boys'fun. The clubs were by no means perfect, though. We found Iguana Lady inAndrew's group every bit as awful as Jack and Joyce and poor Molly did; and wenoticed some of the leaders in the older groups barking orders to the kidslike drill sergeants. In addition, even though Andrew and Daniel had fun, theyat times seemed a little worn out from the heat and all the activity. Theclubs make no provision for kids who are tired or restless or may be justmissing their parents; they get dragged along to the next activity anyway.;   Still, on the positive side, the club leaders were mostly friendly and seemedto like being with kids. The activities were creative and the kids' meals asgood as the boys get at home (often better). They certainly got a wide choiceof food -- from the standard hot dogs and fries to salads, veggies and chicken(if you're lucky enough to have kids who'll go for the good stuff; at leastone of ours does).;    Since we've been home, Daniel hasn't had too much tosay about the trip, but he does light up when we say Ileana's name. And Wahhas finally dried out from his dip in the pool.;    As for Andrew, he keepsreferring to &quot;my club&quot; and has popped out several times with &quot;I want to goback to Mexico!&quot; That's all Scott and I need to feel the vacation was asuccess.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  PATRICIA PATTERSON  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910609  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Sunday  </DAY><MONTH>  June  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1T  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  715  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Sunday June 9, 199100161179,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
