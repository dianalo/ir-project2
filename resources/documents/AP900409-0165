Depreciate Subscriber Lists</HEAD><DATELINE>NEWARK, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A newspaper company can depreciate paidsubscriber lists acquired through the purchase of other publishinginterests, a federal judged ruled April 3.   The ruling paves the way for the Newhouse family-owned MorningLedger Co. of Newark to depreciate $71 million on amended taxreturns, said Donald A. Robinson, the Newark attorney whorepresented the Newhouse family.   Robinson said the company also will collect an undeterminedamount of interest from the Internal Revenue Service on thepreviously disallowed depreciation deductions.   The Newark Morning Ledger Co., owner of The Star-Ledger ofNewark, sued the IRS after the agency refused to let the companydepreciate subscriber lists for eight Michigan papers it acquiredin 1977. Depreciating the lists would decrease the company'staxable income.   During the hearing, Morning Ledger attorneys argued thatsubscriber lists should be treated like tangible _ and hencedepreciable _ assets because they are used in the taxpayer'sbusiness for a limited period of time.   U.S. District Judge H. Lee Sarokin agreed with the plaintiffsthat paid subscriber lists are of limited value because subscribersdie, move and cancel subscriptions.   Sarokin found that even if the circulation of a newspaperremains constant, the publisher spends a substantial amount of timeand money in advertising and subscription drives to replace lostcustomers.   The government argued that subscriber lists are an intangibleasset that cannot be separated from the company's ``goodwill.''   If the company were given the depreciation allowance, anybusiness with paying customers could claim depreciation by sayingthe customers have a limited useful life, Gregory Hrebiniak, alawyer with the Justice Department's tax division, argued.   The Morning Ledger company acquired Booth Newspapers, Inc., ofAnn Arbor, Mich., in 1977. The group was worth about $314 millionand had a combined circulation of 460,000, according to the legalopinion.   Booth's eight newspapers in Michigan were The Ann Arbor News,The Bay City Times, The Flint Journal, The Grand Rapids Press,Jackson Citizen Patriot, Kalamazoo Gazette, The Muskegon Chronicleand Saginaw News.   The Morning Ledger's parent company is Advance PublicationsInc., a publishing company owned by the Newhouse family.</TEXT><HEAD>Times Herald Editor, in Court, Denounces `Features Grab' by Rival</HEAD><DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The editor of the Dallas Times Herald said April6 his counterpart at the rival Dallas Morning News ``stalked foryears'' the features that have become the center of a $33 millionantitrust suit.   ``The features were extremely important but it was the actitself that was deplorable,'' Times Herald Editor Roy Bode said ofa ``features grab'' by the Morning News and its editor, BurlOsborne.   Bode's remarks drew immediate objections from Morning Newsattorneys. Osborne denied the characterization.   ``I have no recollection of ever aggressively pursuing theirpackage,'' he said during testimony as a hostile witness called byTimes Herald attorneys.   The Times Herald is seeking the $33 million and unspecifiedpunitive damages from the Morning News and parent company A.H. BeloCorp.   A joint venture between Belo and Universal Press Syndicate Inc.left the Times Herald without comics and columns that included DearAbby, Erma Bombeck and Doonesbury _ all distributed by KansasCity-based UPS.   Belo and Universal Press announced their venture, UniversalBelo, to develop syndicate features for television use. Osbornesaid the shift of the entire UPS package to his newspaper was acondition required by the syndicate.   The Times Herald alleges the venture and the transfer of thefeatures violated antitrust laws and was an attempt to create amonopoly and drive the Times Herald out of business.   The trial began April 2 and is expected to last at least a month.</TEXT><HEAD>Monthly N.J. Sports Tabloid To Debut</HEAD><DATELINE>BYRAM TOWNSHIP, N.J.
