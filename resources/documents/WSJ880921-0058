As expected, IBM said that, among other things, IBM will sell telecommunications products in the U.S. that can communicate using an international standard called OSI. Because many other companies have been building machines that conform to the same standard, that gives the machines a sort of common language they can use to talk to each other.    The Armonk, N.Y., computer giant also introduced products that help customers in managing their telecommunications networks. In addition, it said it will offer a service that will have IBM help customers spot and correct problems in their telecommunications and computer networks. </TEXT></DOC>
