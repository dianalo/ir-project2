At other rallies Tuesday, radical students demanded thegovernment not arrest a radical student returning from anotherillegal trip to North Korea. Lawmakers and members of the leadingParty for Peace and Democracy sat cross-legged on straw mats inSeoul, angrily jabbing clenched fists in the air and shouting,``Apologize, regime of (President) Roh Tae-woo,'' and ``Stopsuppressing the PPD.''   The party says a national security agency investigation into oneof its lawmaker's illegal trip to North Korea has been enlarged todestroy the party. Protesters said they will continue the sit-inuntil Roh's government apologizes publicly.   They said the latest ``fabrication'' is a story publishedTuesday by the official news agency Yonhap suggesting party leaderKim Dae-jung wrote a letter to North Korean leader Kim Il Sung.   Party leaders do not deny their National Assemblyman SuhKyung-won made an illegal trip to Pyongyang, but they say they hadno prior knowledge of the trip and charge investigators are using``black propaganda'' to destroy the party.   They visited Prime Minister Kang Young-hoon Tuesday to press foran apology.   The government, increasingly embarrassed by secret, illegalvisits to the communist north by a student, a clergyman and thelawmaker, has increased police surveillance of colleges anduniversities and offered rewards for radical student leaders.   Meanwhile, the Agency for National Security Planning announcedTuesday its intelligence agents have arrested nine people,including a college professor, and charged them with violating thenational security law and pressing unification efforts in sympathywith North Korea.   The government says it will press similar charges againstradical student Im Su-kyong, who plans to re-enter South Korea onThursday, the anniversary of the cease-fire which ended the 1950-53Korean War, by crossing at Panmunjom truce village in thedemilitarized zone.   For radicals and dissidents, the border crossing symbolizestheir demands for unifying the peninsula divided since the end ofWorld War II.   The United Nations Command, in charge of security at Panmunjom,said it notified Pyongyang late Tuesday that it ``cannot agree tothe transit'' of Ms. Im, meaning her crossing would violate the1953 armistice.   Police have been on top alert for radical student leaders theyfeel promoted her illegal visit.   A news conference at Seoul's Sunkyunkwan University to discussMs. Im's return was aborted Tuesday after 200 riot police blockedthe school's gates and marched to the meeting place. Half a dozenstudent leaders fled. None was arrested.   About 75 radical students at Seoul National University and asimilar number at Seoul's Dongguk University rallied Tuesday todemand the withdrawal of 43,000 U.S. troops in South Korea under amutual defense pact. They said the soldiers ``hinder unification.''   The government maintains dialogue on unification must beconducted through official channels and charges the north isinstigating unrest by trying to bypass those channels.</TEXT></DOC>
