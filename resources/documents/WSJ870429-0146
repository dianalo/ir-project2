The plan follows the purchase by Fletcher of 47% of British Columbia Forest Products Ltd. and 94% of Crown Forest Industries Ltd. Both are Canadian forest-products companies.    The British government said it will sell 801.5 million ROLLS-ROYCE PLC shares, which go on sale tomorrow, for the equivalent of $2.81 each. That values the state-owned aircraft-engine maker at $2.25 billion. Rolls-Royce's share price falls in the middle range of analysts' recent expectations. Investor demand is expected to be strong for the offering, the latest in the Conservative government's series of state asset sales that have raised about $24 billion since 1979. </TEXT></DOC>
