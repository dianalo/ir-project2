The source bed, Ek{sub2}, to the South of Kongdian in Huanghua Depression, is the second memberof Kongdian group (Paleogene). The analysis shows that the hydrocarbon-escapearea of Ek{sub 2} is enlarging along with the geological development,and that the Guantao, Lower Minghuazhen is the primary hydrocarbon-escapeperiod. Through comparing the pressure profiles from compaction curveswith known oil and gas accumulation, the close association of the latterwith relatively high excess pressure can be seen. Finally, the authorsalso evaluate the prospect of oil finding in this area from the pointof view of migration. 10 references, 4 figures, 2 tables.</TEXT></DOC>
