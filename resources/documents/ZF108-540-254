Coughlin.andM;He acknowledged much of the work remains to be done.andP;  In the next four years,the service plans to install 6,500 to 7,000 pieces of equipment.andM;The service is only about 25 percent into the deployment of automation thatwill let it process virtually all mail automatically, Coughlin told a joingmeeting of the Post Office and Civil Service Subcommittee on PostalOperations and Services and the Subcommittee on Postal Personnel andModernization.andM;&quot;There are bound to be some bumps in the road as we move closer to a fullyautomated mail stream,&quot; Coughlin said, maintaining that the USPS plan doesnot over-estimate the agency's ability to stay on schedule.andM;The Postal Board of Governors has approved spending $380 million this yearand next for the first phase of a three-part automation strategy.andM;The entire automation program will cost $18 billion.andM;&quot;The first phase of the program is a significant step toward completing ourletter mail automation network, a network that will meet growing mail volumeand any changes in customer needs during this decade,&quot; said PostmasterGeneral Anthony M. Frank.andM;Despite the assurances from the service, members of Congress, the postalunions, service oversight groups and businesses that depend on the mails havequestioned the plan's soundness.andM;The most recent criticism cam from the Postal rate Commission, which issued areport saying hiring freezes, not better mail processing, had increasedproductivity.andP;  Similar reports came late last  year and early this year fromthe General Accountin Office and the Postal Inspection Service.andM;Board of Governors president Robert Setrakian told Congress last month thatconverting to the new equipment had hurt postal service during the past fewmonths.andM;&quot;I'm concerned by that statement, because the Postal Service has known forover five years that increased automation would be implemented,&quot; said Rep.andO;Frank McCloskey (D-Ind.), chairman of Postal Operations and Services.andO;&quot;According to Chairman Setrakian, the conversion problems will not be solvedovernight.&quot;andM;Fair ShareandM;Union leaders have complained often and bitterly that the service does notshare information with them about the automation effort and its effects onjobs.andP;  Subcommittee members voiced similar concerns.andM;&quot;I'm beginning to sound like a broken record on this issue,&quot; Rep.andP;  FrankHorton (D-N.Y.) said.andP;  &quot;The Postal Service continues to shoot itself in thefoot by not making an audience with the employee community to ensure successof its automation program.&quot;andM;Coughlin denied that the service intentionally stonewalled employee groups.andO;He said top management does meet with employees, but one-on-one explanationsabout automation and training will occur at postal centers as systems come online.andP;  The service is rolling out a new education program next month, hesaid.andM;&quot;The problem at this point is that we cannot tell the specific impact on aspecific employee at a specific point at this time,&quot; Coughlin said.andM;The service has promised that all personnel cuts will occur throughattrition.andP;  &quot;By 1995 with full implementation, it will have an effect of100,000 work years avoided as a result of automation,&quot; Coughlin said.andM;The first part of the three-phase program stresses buying and upgradingequipment for use in the major mail processing centers.andP;  Between now and1992, the service will buy bar code readers and sorters, as well as finishdeveloping technology to bring hand-addressed and problem mail into theautomated mail stream.andM;The Postal Service plans to buy 1,345 wide-area bar code readers,retrofitting the single-line sorters now used.andP;  Wide-area readers can locatebar codes anywhere on a letter's face.andP;  By 1995, these readers should be ableto process 50 billion letters each year using customer-applied bar codes,postal officials said.andM;To reduce labor costs in preparing mail for delivery, the service will buy1,227 smaller delivery bar code sorters.andP;  These systems take sorted mail andre-sort it for the carriers' delivery routes.andM;Lastly, the service plans to put its prototype remote bar coding system intooperation.andP;  The current plan calls for buying 40 of these systems andlocating them in central processing facilities.andM;These remote systems, which use video-captured images of mail and patternrecognition technology, are an essential ingredient if the service is toachieve  its 1995 automation goal.andP;  Remote bar coding is designed to bringback into the automated stream troublesome mail that has been diverted fromcomputerized systems for manual handling.andM;In 1992, the board will be asked to approve the second phase of theautomation strategy.andP;  Plans for the later two phases have not been spelledout.andP;  But during the second stage the service wants household and smallerbusiness mailers to begin using bar codes, too.andM;During the third phase, set to begin in late 1993, the service plans tocomplete and fine-tune its automated system.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
