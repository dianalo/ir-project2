Deputy press secretary Roman Popadiuk said Bush had talked withKemp on Saturday about allegations of multimillion-dollar fraud atHUD during the Reagan administration.   ``He's confident the secretary can turn around the managementsituation there,'' Popadiuk told reporters. ``The secretary istackling the situation.''   For his part, Kemp vowed in a television interview Sunday to rootout politics and influence-peddling at the agency he has headedsince earlier this year.   Denying that the burgeoning HUD scandal was symptomatic of a``laissez-faire'' attitude during the Reagan years, Kemp said thatanytime the government subsidizes major industries, problems arebound to occur.   But he said that under his leadership, HUD had reinstitutedcompetitive bidding procedures ``and removed the bias, theprejudice, the politics'' from its grant programs.   Popadiuk said, ``Secretary Kemp said he is determined to clean upthe department in every way and would not tolerate any abuse of thepublic trust ... The president is confident the secretary is goingto turn the management around and get control of the situation atHUD.''   ``I'm told the president wants to get to the bottom of this,'' headded.   Asked when Bush expected Kemp to complete his job of restoringgood management practices, Popadiuk said: ``I'm not going to put atimetable on that. But as soon as possible, the better.''   Kemp, appearing on the CBS-TV show, ``Face the Nation,'' wasasked whether then-President Reagan's pledge to get the governmentoff the people's backs could be blamed for the subsequent scandalsthat hit the savings and loan and defense industries, and now HUD.   ``I don't think laissez-faire is quite the right word for it,''Kemp said. ``The system was flawed to the extent that when you getin the business of having the government subsidize big developers orbig defense contractors, or any person, without a competitiveprocess based upon merit and need and quality, then you're going toget into the problems that we have rooted out and are trying to rootout at HUD. ...   ``But I can assure you that the political influence of contractsgoing to people with political friends has been going on for quitesome time,'' he added. ``I'm not trying to shift the blame toDemocrats or Republicans, but I want to public to know that thissecretary, under this president, is going to remove the politics andthe influence-peddling from the agency over which I have been askedto exert leadership.''   On an appearance Saturday on CNN's ``Evans and Novak'' show, Kempsaid: ``I think it is very clear there have been some who have beencriminal.''   That contradicted earlier statements by HUD's inspector general,Paul Adams, that his staff had not found evidence of criminalityduring its audit of HUD accounting procedures and contract awardsprograms during the tenure of former HUD Secretary Samuel Pierce.   Kemp acknowledged that his former presidential campaign manager,Charles Black, later went to work to get HUD contracts for clients.But he said there was no ``quid pro quo'' that Black, in return forcampaign work, would be able to cash in later with governmentlobbying activities.   Kemp has released an internal audit by Adams that said millionsof dollars in HUD subsidies were distributed for renovation oflow-incoming housing without regard to need or fairness, and thatmuch of the money was steered to private developers who formerly hadbeen HUD officials or had ties to prominent Republicans.   Adams found developers had paid millions in consulting fees toformer HUD officials or prominent Republicans, including formerInterior Secretary James Watt, who received $400,000.   Also under investigation are HUD's program of using outsidecontractors known as closing agents to handle foreclosure sales ofgovernment property. Agents are believed to have made off withmillions of dollars they were supposed to turn over to thegovernment.   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh on Thursday ordered a federalinvestigation of all HUD offices for fraud and embezzlement.   Kemp said Sunday the attorney general ``is going to have to makedecisions as to criminality.'' Pierce's involvement, he said, ``willbe looked at politically, it will be looked through the inspectorgeneral.''</TEXT></DOC>
