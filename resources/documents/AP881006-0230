The exact time and location for the talks were not determinedand it was not yet confirmed whether the U.S. State Departmentwould continue mediating the talks, as it has in previous meetings,said Aubrey Dwyer, a spokesman for South Africa's U.N. Mission, onThursday.   South Africa has told Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellarit is ready to begin implementation on Nov. 1 of Security CouncilResolution 435 to give neighboring South-West Africa, or Namibia,its freedom.   Resolution 435, passed a decade ago, is a one-year plan fornational assembly elections under U.N. supervision.   About 7,500 U.N. peacekeeping troops and 2,000 civilian supportstaff are to be sent to Namibia in an operation estimated to costbetween $600 million and $700 million.   South Africa has ruled the former German colony since World WarI. The United Nations revoked a mandate from its predecessor, theLeague of Nations, and declared Pretoria's rule over Namibiaillegal.   Complicating the plan is South Africa's insistence that about50,000 Cuban troops stationed in Angola to protect that country'sMarxist government from the UNITA rebel movement should bewithdrawn in a year. UNITA stands for the National Union for theTotal Independence of Angola.   The Cubans have reportedly compromised their initial insistenceon a four-year withdrawal down to two years, with a phasedwithdrawal away from southern Angola's border with northern Namibia.   Officials involved in the talks among the United States, Angola,Cuba and South Africa, including U.S. Secretary of State GeorgeShultz, have expressed confidence that a mutually acceptablecompromise will be reached on the withdrawal timetable.</TEXT></DOC>
