Margulies began at Children's Hospital, Boston.andM;The vice president of the information systems department at Children's,Margulies was hired in 1986 to bring the hospital into the modern age ofcomputing.andP;  Now well into a three-year plan that concludes at year-end,Margulies' experience demonstrates that advances in hardware and especiallysoftware technology in the mid- to late-1980s now make possible astate-of-the-art integrated hospital information system (HIS) based onoff-the-shelf products and software standards.andM;The lesson for commercial MIS and data processing is that today's technologycan be used to create an integrated information system featuring a central&quot;virtual&quot; database that balances the needs of departments with those of theoverall organization, and the ability to exploit technical advances such asthe networking of text, voice and image objects.andP;  Another lesson is thatclient/server database architecture can provide some clear benefits.andM;A primary advance that makes Children's HIS possible is a distributed,relational database with a standard query language.andP;  Children's chose Oraclefrom Oracle Corp., Belmont, Calif., in late 1986.andM;&quot;The decision to license Oracle proceeded from the emphasis on network-basedapplication distribution, platform independence and the belief that Oraclewas going to be a fiscally sound and growing concern,&quot; said Margulies, who isa graduate of the Harvard Medical School, Boston.andM;In Children's HIS, Oracle is a central &quot;virtual database,&quot; accessible fromany department requiring its services.andP;  The virtual database either points toor replicates major subsets of departmental data needed to createcross-departmental views.andP;  Its data elements are those that need to be sharedby diverse systems.andP;  For example, a physician in an intensive care unit canuse a departmental Macintosh or VAXstation to call up a patient's X-ray.andO;Oracle contains the pointers to help make the connection possible.andM;The decision to create this virtual database was made because no supplierthen or now offers an off-the-shelf HIS solution that could satisfy allhospital users.andP;  Also, Margulies views custom software developed in-house astoo expensive to build and maintain.andP;  Each department at Children's is freeto acquire the best available software, as long as the supplier is willing towrite the interfaces to connect to the virtual database.andM;Until Margulies arrived, Children's information system was typical of ahospital at the time: IBM mainframe with 200+ terminal users, used primarilyto run batch-oriented financial applications.andM;But the hospital's clinicians were awakening to the power of computers,spurred by their counterparts at Beth Israel and Brigham and Women'shospitals, Boston, Duke University, Durham, N.C., and the Latter Day SaintsHospital, Salt Lake City, all of which had developed innovative computingsolutions.andM;Further incentive for a revolution in MIS followed from changes in federalgovernment hospital reimbursement formulas, which began to reward operatingefficiency.andM;This delay in the automation of hospitals may have been a blessing indisguise.andP;  &quot;Health care was really the abandoned stepchild of computing formany years.andP;  The market was not really a business until the advent of DRGs[Diagnosis Related Groupings, of U.S.andP;  Department of Health and HumanServices], which forced health care to become a business,&quot; Margulies said.andO;&quot;But by awakening late, health care may have an advantage.&quot;andM;HIS GOALSandM;Children's senior management concluded that information systems needed to bea high priority for investment, and that the organization needed a chiefinformation officer.andP;  A team was assigned to design an HIS architecture.andP;  Thegoals were to: emphasize a balancing of department and institution needs,automate patient records in stages, meet standards of information systemsexcellence, and use industry standards and commercial tools where possible.andM;The specific needs of financial, clinical, research and academic computing atChildren's, a teaching hospital affiliated with the Harvard Medical School,meant that the HIS had to be multivendor.andP;  &quot;There is no vendor with an HISwhose functionality is adequate across clinical departments,&quot; said Margulies.andM;Children's chose a clustered, processor-based system using distributed,heterogeneous database techniques and an Ethernet local area network.andP;  Phaseone consisted of installing the wiring scheme and network management tools;phase two was to acquire departmental applications; and phase three has beento tie the departments together into the virtual database.andM;The hardware environment currently features a Digital Equipment Corp.andO;VAXcluster (two VAX 8800s, an 8700, and on order, a VAX 6000-440).andP;  Thehospital also owns an IBM mainframe (3090-150E running VM with Oracle underMVS, an &quot;Oracle server&quot;), VMS workstations, PCs Macintoshes and otherconnected processors.andP;  The total computer power approximates 100 Mips,excluding PCs.andP;  The IBM mainframe has four connections to the VAXcluster:Flexlink; a DEC SNA gateway product which does terminal emulation; anInterlink product which makes the MVS mainframe a Decnet node; and OracleSQL/Connect from VMS to MVS.andP;  The network has 3,500 users and 1,400 devicesin 26 departments.andM;Software drove the decision to go with a VAXcluster.andP;  &quot;The portfolio ofavailable clinical applications was superior on the VAX side,&quot; Marguliessaid.andP;  &quot;And the basic structure of hospitals is so department-intensive, thenature of the problem was integrating departmental systems.&quot;andM;A critical piece in the hospital's integration puzzle is a &quot;core broadcast&quot;that feeds the virtual database automatically.andP;  For example, minutes after anX-ray is taken, the image is posted in the electronic patient record on thenetwork.andP;  The patient's record appears as a notebook, with pages listingtransactions and images, such as radiography.andP;  Authorized physicians can callup the record and, using a mouse, retrieve pages for viewing on aworkstation.andM;&quot;The core broadcast is the key to synchronizing ourapplication-to-application techniques,&quot; said Margulies.andM;This broadcast is made possible by software from Simborg Systems Corp.,andO;Breenbrae, Calif., which provides systems integration products for hospitals.andO;The firm's StatLan product offers a workstation-based front end that providesa consistent user interface across a multivendor network.andP;  Host-basedapplication-level network management and configuration software provides thesupport and background functions for the hospital's information systems groupto manage, monitor and control the network.andM;StatLan has been on the market just over two years.andP;  During the firm's 1989fiscal year, its user base increased from eight hospitals to 25, said founderand physician Dr. Don Simborg.andM;&quot;Children's is not our most advanced hospital; I consider it a work inprogress.&quot;andP;  said Simborg.andP;  &quot;Dr.andP;  Margulies is going to extend the envelopeand bring in future capabilities that will make it one of the most advancedhospitals in an open architecture environment.&quot;andM;The two doctors have different ideas of the optimal information systems modelfor hospitals.andP;  Simborg attaches more importance to the role of thespecialized departmental database, while Margulies is building a centralvirtual database accessible by all departments though the same userinterface.andM;&quot;My view of hospital open architecture in this decade is that large, complexinstitutions will have multiple, integrated databases focusing on differentfunctions,&quot; Simborg said.andP;  &quot;I am not a believer that you will always have asingle database in a hospital.andP;  The niche products are fairly complicated.&quot;andM;Margulies said, &quot;Dr.andP;  Simborg and I have converging views.andP;  He is nowfocusing on the role of a central database, and I acknowledge that somefunctions are best served by remote procedure calls directly to departmentalsystems.&quot;andP;  Recently, the two doctors agreed to collaborate on development ofa commercial product based on Children's clinician's workstation application.andM;In Simborg's view, client/server architecture is not an essential element,since he believes a peer-to-peer model may be applicable to more situations.andO;&quot;Sometimes, you might have a client/server relation.andP;  Other times, you havepeer-to-peer, and other times, you have a one-to-many relationship.andP;  No onemodel serves every purpose,&quot; he said.andM;The client/server architecture is useful in Children's information systemmodel, Margulies said.andP;  &quot;It helps us achieve some of the benefits of asingle, large institutional database, while allowing us to distribute to anappropriate-scale box.&quot;andP;  Most compound document and image manipulation isdone through client/server processes, he said.andM;Ease of use, especially as provided by a consistent graphic user interface,wasa key requirement for Children's physician's workstation.andP;  The applicationuses icons familiar to its users, such as a medical chart, floor map and anursing notebook.andP;  &quot;We show people the same things they are used to seeing,&quot;Margulies said.andP;  &quot;It's the Mac religion restated.&quot;andM;Children's has little interest in OS/2-Presentation Manager workstations.andO;&quot;DOS is fine and workstation equal Unix.andP;  The workstation technology we arestandardizing on is X and graphical user interfaces using X.andP;  We arestruggling among workstation user interfaces like many other users, butPresentation Manager is not in the mix, and neither is Mac OS.andP;  Both areusable graphical user interfaces, but they are not standards.&quot;andM;HL7 OPEN SYSTEM IMPACTandM;The open systems movement has been helpful to Children's effort to usestandard systems, although the movement is only beginning to have an impactin hospitals nationwide.andP;  &quot;We could not do an integrated hospital systemwithout the emergence of standards inspired by the OSI model,&quot; Marguliessaid.andM;Simborg's StatLan is the basis for the Health Level 7(HL7) hospital protocolstandard, a nonproprietary application-level data interchange standard forthe health care industry.andP;  &quot;It is a protocol in the early stage ofacceptance,&quot; said Simborg.andP;  Consistent with the Ansi X.12 standard for widearea networking, HL7 is supported by a self-funded member organization.andO;Through a coordinating committee, an effort is being made to convergeoverlapping standards in health care, Simborg said.andM;Departments that benefit by Children's move toward an integrated HISacknowledge its contribution.andP;  &quot;The system has coordinated results from labsall over the institution into a single database,&quot; said Dr. Joseph Alpers,director of clinical laboratories at Children's.andP;  &quot;Now, the physician canfind everything in a single search.&quot;andP;  The labs feeding the database includevirology, immunology, cytogenetics, the blood bank, endocrinology andbacteriology.andM;The system serves an important academic purpose as well, he said.andP;  &quot;To haveall the objective results in a single database will be an extremely powerfulassist to the hundreds of physicians and other professionals at thisinstitution who perform clinical investigation.andP;  It is very important forresearch to be able to access data with such convenience.&quot;andM;Children's uses text management software to help retrieve research results.andO;Margulies is experienced in this area as well.andP;  He authored a large-scalemedical information system called Bibliographic Retrieval Service/Colleague(BRS/Colleague), and founded a company to market it in Latham, N.Y.andP;  Latersold to Maxwell Corp. of England, BRS/Colleague is used by tens of thousandsof physicians.andP;  The online database contains the text of many medical booksand journals, as well as the bibliographic holdings of the National Libraryof Medicine.andM;The text database at Children's uses the Topic retrieval engine from Verity,Mountain View, Calif.andP;  &quot;Verity is a key piece for one mode of browse,&quot; saidMargulies.andP;  By allowing users to weight the relevance of desired terms ofclasses of terms, Topic is said to achieve up to 95% retrieval accuracy.andM;ENTERPRISE COMPUTING LAB, TOOandM;In addition to its work in integrated HIS, Children's is a laboratory for theorganizational impact of enterprise-wide computing.andP;  Margulies said,&quot;Enterprise computing requires adherence on an institutional scale to certainarchitectural rules, and the selection of applications more suitable fornetwork-based integration.andM;&quot;In some instances, however, a certain department may want to pick anapplication which is ill-suited for integration on an enterprise scale.andO;That's when the war begins.andP;  It requires sacrificing for a greater good, asupport that humans provide poorly,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;There is a continuousmanagement tension.&quot;andM;MORE VOICE, IMAGING USE AHEADandM;Future directions at Children's include pursuing wider use of voice andimaging, for example, attaching voice objects to X-rays.andP;  &quot;The gap betweenthe image and the image plus the interpretation of the radiology specialistis substantial.andP;  So we're working on attaching the voice to the imagedirectly,&quot; Dr. Margulies said.andM;Dr.andP;  John Kirkpatrick, the radiologist-in-chief at Children's, said, &quot;Thebeauty of this system is that down the road, we can have ultrasonography,nuclear medicine, magnetic resonance imaging and angiography imagingdigitized.andP;  There's no reason why we should't be able to pull up all thoseimages.&quot;andM;Children's experience in MIS shows that the absence of a complete solution isnot a reason to avoid the pursuit.andP;  &quot;The best is the enemy of the better,&quot;Margulies said.andP;  A barrier in the transmission of images, for instance, isthe fact that many image-authoring devices cannot produce digital output, andthere is no authoring language to place a bit-mapped image in a compounddocument.andP;  &quot;But by mid-1991, that should be available,&quot; Margulies said.andM;The virtual database may also be a useful model for commercial MIS.andP;  &quot;Ourmodel is being emulated by hospitals around the country,&quot; Margulies said.andO;&quot;One cannot fully replicate the advantages of a single, homogeneous dataenvironment when one is using 20 different environments.andP;  But we've come along way in creating a virtual database.&quot;andM;And with information systems Vice President Margulies at the helm, Children'swill travel a lot further.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
