Cowles III.   ``That was good progress,'' Cowles, president and publisher ofthe Spokane, Wash., Spokesman-Review and the Spokane Chronicle, toldthe 61st annual meeting of the American Newspaper PublishersAssociation on Monday. Cowles is chairman of the association.   ``Today's `protocol for progress,' however, demands that we focusnot what's behind our taillights, but rather on what's in front ofour headlights,'' he said.   The APNA convention is being held in conjunction with displays offuturistic technology, and its theme is ``Protocols for Progress.''   ``Every year we have a little clutch of fear that our technologyis about to plateau; and every year it doesn't. This means we justhave time to take a deep breath before we have to start learningagain.''   In addition to 300 displays of the latest technology, there willbe workshops on the newest production, administration, salestechniques and news gathering techniques discussed in workshopsessions. The convention ends on Wednesday.   Reg Murphy, the publisher and chief executive officer of The Sunin Baltimore blamed a 10 percent drop in newspaper readership overthe past several years on illiteracy, competition with other newsmedia and competition for readers' time.   ``People who can't read don't buy newspapers,'' Murphy saidMonday.   The fight for literacy was one example Murphy gave of the sort ofcommunity involvement newspapers should have if they are to competesuccessfully for readers and advertising money.   ``The toughest competition in our game is for the time of ourreaders,'' he said.   ``You won't find many women lingering over the newspaper withtheir coffee anymore,'' he said. ``They might like to, but they havecorporations to run and surgery to perform.''</TEXT></DOC>
