Carroll (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> IBM </CO><IN> EDP </IN><DATELINE> NEW YORK  </DATELINE><TEXT>   International Business Machines Corp. will more than double the power of its much-criticized RT workstation within a year, an IBM official said in an interview.    The company has been embarrassed in the workstation market, and Arthur G. Goldberg, one of the leaders of the RT project, said IBM is making a huge push to change its image. As part of that, he said the Armonk, N.Y.-based computer giant will have available relatively soon an RT that will be at least twice as powerful as the current machine for general purposes and many times as fast for the engineering and design applications that workstations generally handle. The RT has been criticized as an underpowered machine since its introduction in early 1986, so the improvement would address a major concern among customers.    It's not at all clear that IBM isn't just throwing good money after bad; the computer industry is brutal to products that get off to a slow start, and the workstation market is moving even faster than the rest of the industry.    But IBM is taking steps that give it at least a chance to make a big dent in the market over the next couple of years. That will be crucial, because workstations are becoming so powerful and inexpensive that they figure to become an increasingly important part of the industry.    International Data Corp., Framingham, Mass., says the workstation market has doubled in size every year since 1982 and will continue growing nearly 30% a year over the next few years, becoming a $9.4 billion market by 1992.    Reflecting that phenomenal growth, IBM has said it was spending as much money on development of RT hardware as it spends on hardware for its enormous personal-computer business. Mr. Goldberg added in the interview that IBM has assigned some 160 people to developing RT applications or to getting software companies to make their applications run on the RT. He acknowledged that the RT has suffered from a lack of applications, but said the group is making progress.    Mr. Goldberg also said IBM sharply increased the incentives for salesmen of its RTs, almost to the level of commissions they get for selling some minicomputers. In addition, he said IBM plans a tenfold increase by next year in the number of technical people available for customer support for the RT and the version of Unix that serves as its operating system.    He insisted that all the changes mean IBM will no longer hinder the RT out of fear that the workstation will cut into sales of minicomputers and personal computers.    &quot;We expect to be the leading vendor of workstations over the next several years,&quot; said Mr. Goldberg. He said IBM, having already fixed many of the RT's initial problems, has been gaining market share, with June the best month ever for RT shipments.    Mr. Goldberg said the $3.6 billion contract that IBM recently won from the Federal Aviation Administration, for an airtraffic control system, was largely based on the RT and will involve the shipment of 12,000 to 15,000 future versions of the RT. In addition, he said IBM has had considerable success selling RTs for general corporate uses, which ordinarily are handled with personal computers and minicomputers. He said half of IBM's RT sales come from that market, which other workstation makers generally don't address.    Still, IBM faces a hard march. International Data said IBM had just 3.9% of the world-wide market in 1987 for workstations used in the traditional scientific and engineering environments. Sun Microsystems Inc. had 29%; Apollo Computer Inc. had 21%; Digital Equipment Corp. had 20%; and Hewlett-Packard Co. had 12%. All of them will be hard to dislodge.    A Sun spokeswoman noted that IBM has been talking up the RT ever since its introduction and has made numerous announcements of faster machines without ever capturing the imagination of the market. &quot;That's kind of the history of the RT, isn't it?&quot; she said. &quot;They come out with something underwhelming and then their enhancements are what you thought they'd do the last time.&quot;    The sorts of things IBM is doing to improve the performance of its machines also are being done by competitors. All are working on what is called &quot;pipelining&quot; instructions, which basically is a way of getting a central processor to handle more than one instruction at a time. All are working on improving the speed of what are called floating-point operations, which do the heavy number-crunching necessary for scientific applications. And all are working on improving their compilers, which are layers of software that translate instructions from the operating system into a language the hardware can understand.    If IBM does get the RT moving, it will be a remarkable turnaround after a long series of mistakes. Mr. Goldberg acknowledged that the RT was initially designed to be a personal computer and became a workstation only when that market heated up and IBM found it didn't have anything to sell. As a result, it was underpowered and had little software that would help with workstations' scientific and engineering applications.    In addition, IBM hobbled the marketing of the RT because it worried that the product would cut into personal-computer and minicomputer sales.    Even after IBM announced products more than a year ago that addressed those problems, it had trouble producing enough memory chips for them, delaying volume shipments until late last year. </TEXT></DOC>
