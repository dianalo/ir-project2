With the advent of recombinantDNA technology, they directed their efforts to the molecular cloningof human genes defective in XP, with a view to using the cloned genesto overexpress proteins of interest for biochemical investigations. Initialstudies exploited the selectable phenotype of marked sensitivity to killingof XP group A cells by UV radiation and by other DNA damaging agents.However, except for a single report in 1982 there has been no reproducibledemonstration of complementation of the UV sensitivity of XP cells byDNA-mediated transfection. The apparent difficulties associated withtransfection of XP cells have been the subject of several recent studies.In view of the multiple problems associated with stable transfectionof XP cells using total genomic DNA, they have embarked on an alternativestrategy designed to facilitate the cloning of human XP genes. This strategyinvolves the transfer of single human chromosomes into XP cells and screeningfor this relatively high frequency event. The idea is to identify chromosomeson which particular XP genes reside and then to isolate non-complementingderivatives of these chromosomes so that highly enriched DNA pools containinggenes of interest can be generated by employing one or more subtractivestrategies.</TEXT></DOC>
