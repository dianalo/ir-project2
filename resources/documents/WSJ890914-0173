So why limit it to arguments about stocks?    Two new books stake out opposite positions on a much more important topic than IBM's third-quarter earnings. They address the vexing issue of whether a steady procession of buy-outs, mergers, restructurings and takeovers is good or bad for the American economy.    Defending the takeover movement is Harvey Segal, a one-time Citibank vice president and former economics writer for the Washington Post and the New York Times. In &quot;Corporate Makeover&quot; (Viking, 269 pages, $19.95), a wide-ranging look at everything from Adam Smith's writings to the RJR Nabisco deal, Mr. Segal generally sees acquisitions and restructurings as a cure for corporate sloth and mismanagement.    At the heart of Mr. Segal's argument is a belief that big corporations have lost their way. Giants such as Sears Roebuck and Exxon have stumbled when they tried to diversify. Surveys show that executives get well paid whether their companies prosper or not. And Mr. Segal is suspicious of corporate perks, focusing on partridge-shooting parties by oil-company executives and the now well-known excesses at Allegheny International under former chief executive officer Robert Buckley.    Mr. Segal makes some lively arguments. In a broadside against Texaco's directors, who have survived through all the Pennzoil litigation, he declares: &quot;General Custer died for his bad judgment at the Little Big Horn and Friedrich von Paulus surrendered in disgrace at Stalingrad. But in corporate wars, generals are more likely to be rewarded than punished for their shortcomings.&quot;    Yet &quot;Corporate Makeover&quot; tries to cover so much ground that it often doesn't venture much beyond what has already appeared in the business press about say, Michael Milken and the price of Big Macs round the world. But the once-over-lightly approach leaves some big puzzles, such as why takeover bids put drastically increased values on RJR, Time Inc. and other well-known companies. Can new buyers maximize values that old management ignored? Or are the tax advantages for a debt-financed takeover that large? Or are other factors at work? Mr. Segal votes for reason No. 1 and races off to the next topic, when a deeper analysis would have been welcome.    It's a shame, too, that Mr. Segal doesn't scrutinize takeover artists with the same vigor that he applies to corporate managers. The raiders have their jets too, and sinecures for needy family members.    If Harvey Segal does his best to wave the flag for takeovers, Max Holland would rather burn that flag. In &quot;When the Machine Stopped&quot; (Harvard Business School Press, 335 pages, $22.95), he looks strictly at the 41-year life story of a single machine-tool company, Burgmaster Corp., which began as an immigrant's dream and ended in liquidation. It's an intriguing study and Mr. Holland shows a storyteller's touch, even if some of his conclusions don't seem to fit his facts.    Burgmaster was founded by Czech immigrant Max Burg in 1945 and grew rapidly. It was a quick innovator, and in the booming markets of the 1950s, everything worked out well. Its strong earnings attracted a conglomerate buyer, Houdaille Industries, in 1965, which in turn was taken private in a leveraged buy-out by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co. in 1979. But Burgmaster soon was overwhelmed by Japanese competition. It started showing losses and in 1986 it was shut down, with its workers dispersed and its equipment sold at auction.    Mr. Holland does his best to blame Burgmaster's problems on the conglomerate acquisition and the subsequent LBO. The book is rich with detail about 20 years of conflicts between numbers-oriented outside managers and shirt-sleeved production leaders who cared only about making good machine tools. There's no question where Mr. Holland's alliances lie; his father was a Burgmaster production employee for 29 years.    But as Mr. Holland acknowledges, Burgmaster's design and production team began to make missteps in the 1970s. The company had many other woes as well, including high labor costs at its Los Angeles-area facilities, the 1980-82 recession, and the high dollar of 1983-85 that touched off a flood of imports. Most tellingly, Burgmaster -- and much of U.S. industry -- disastrously misread Japan's potential in the 1970s, when there was still time and abundant cash flow to improve competitiveness vis-a-vis Pacific Rim competition.    Burgmaster ended up as a rare LBO wipe-out, while Houdaille overall performed passably for its buy-out owners, and many other LBO companies prospered. Burgmaster still is an intriguing case study, if only as an example of what can go wrong, rather than what is symptomatic about takeovers. But Mr. Holland tries to draw the widest lessons possible. He closes his book with a denunciation of U.S. policies that allowed Burgmaster to fail, and the curious belief that if the U.S. had &quot;a coherent role for the government in its economy,&quot; things would be better.    Score it a draw. Mr. Segal probably has the better argument. But Mr. Holland is a better fighter.    ---Mr. Anders covers financial markets for the Journal's New York bureau. </TEXT></DOC>
