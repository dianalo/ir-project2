Kid problems? They come here andthey're 18 again, and they have no problems. And you know they wantto come. Hey, this isn't Phoenix, Arizona. This is Clear Lake, Iowa,in winter,'' Hensley said.   This year's concert is scheduled for Feb. 3-4 at the SurfBallroom in Clear Lake, where Holly performed his last concertbefore he died in a plane crash.   As usual, all 1,600 tickets have been sold for months. The 400others are controlled by the ballroom, a radio station and Hensley,with many reserved for performers, press and security.   After their concert 30 years ago, Holly and fellow rockers J.P.``Big Bopper'' Richardson and Ritchie Valens decided to fly to theirnext gig rather than take the tour bus. Their small chartered planecrashed into a frozen field shortly after takeoff. There were nosurvivors.   Hensley, a radio personality whose on-air name is the Mad Hatter,said there are no special plans for this year's concert. Holly'srelatives have attended before, but none has accepted invitationsthis year.   Hensley, who owns KDWD in Burlington, said this year's activitiesbegin Feb. 3 with an all-night sock hop featuring '50s and '60sfavorites.   The next night, Bobby Vee, the Diamonds and Freddy ``Boom Boom''Cannon will re-create their hits, along with warm-up groups theRockin' Ricochettes of Minneapolis and Bill Dewey and the BlazingBroncos of Clear Lake. The $45 ticket provides admission to bothnights.   Hensley first was host of the concert as a radio personality andowner of KZEV radio in Clear Lake, now owned by his ex-wife, Diane.   ``I was just doing a spoof on the radio show,'' he said. ``I wasbrand new in Iowa, and I explained that we had built the studio bymistake in a time warp. Buddy and Elvis talked to me each morning.... Buddy thought it was strange that nobody put on a concert in hismemory, and Elvis said, `Yeah, man, we got to do this for Buddy.'   ``Then some guy from AP called and asked if I was really going todo it. So we did,'' he said.   ``People from 30 to 50 or 60, they're reliving 1959. Don McLeanwrote that song (``American Pie'') about the day the music died. Ithink he was premature,'' said Hensley. ``Buddy Holly is stillliving today, bigger and better than ever.''</TEXT></DOC>
