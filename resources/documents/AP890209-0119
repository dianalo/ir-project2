(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A former state highway official agreed totestify against others and then changed his plea Thursday to guiltyto federal charges of extortion and filing false income tax returns,prosecutors said.   Sam Waggoner resigned in December as one of the three members ofthe Highway Commission in the face of the impending charges.   Assistant U.S. Attorney Ruth Harris told U.S. District Judge TomS. Lee that Waggoner had helped in the investigation of otherunspecified cases and his ``continued cooperation will includetestimony before grand juries and at trials.''   Lee said Waggoner's sentencing would be scheduled later on theextortion charge involving his acceptance of approximately $127,000in cash from a construction company and three counts of filing falsetax returns for 1984-86, during which the IRS says he underreportedhis income by $190,500.   Waggoner, who was a highway commissioner for 21 years, remainsfree on a $5,000 personal recognizance bond. He also posted a$205,000 bond to cover back taxes, interest and penalties.   Harris recommended Waggoner, 67, be sentenced to two years on theextortion charge and placed on five years' probation on the incometax charges, as well as a $40,000 fine. Waggoner must pay all backtaxes plus interest and penalties.   She said the extortion charge carries a maximum penalty of 20years in jail and a $250,000 fine. Filing false income tax returnscarries a three-year jail term and a $100,000 fine for each count.   Waggoner announced his Dec. 31 resignation in a Dec. 21 statementwhich said: ``I am resigning because I have made a mistake, and Imust now pay the price for that mistake.''   On Wednesday, Lee sentenced a second highway commisioner, BobJoiner, 59, to a six-year prison term on a federal extortion charge.He also received a five-year suspended sentence and was ordered topay a $100,000 fine on a tax evasion charge.   The three members of the Highway Commission are elected only fromthe district which they represent and act autonomously in mattersconcerning road construction and maintenance within their district.There has been considerable public discussion about changing thesystem to make the commission a statewide board, but so far theLegislature has taken no action to change the system.   In the meantime, special elections have been held to replaceWaggoner and Joiner.</TEXT></DOC>
