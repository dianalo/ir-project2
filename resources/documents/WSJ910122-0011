The pilots said they expect the bombing will force thetanks to move from the defensive positions they havemaintained since the Gulf war broke out. While changingpositions, they said, Saddam Hussein's tanks will be morevulnerable to the helicopter attack.</LP><TEXT>   The tank fight will be the central element of the war withIraq once the fighting shifts from the current air war to aland battle designed to rout Iraqi troops from theirpositions inside Kuwait. U.S. officials have suggested that aground campaign isn't likely to begin in the next few days.But most believe that some sort of ground offensive isnecessary to clear Iraqi troops from Kuwait.   The twin-engine Apache helicopter, armed with rockets andlaser-guided missiles, will be the most important weapon inthat phase, officers said. &quot;The mobility and deep-strikecapability of the Apaches will be the most critical link tovictory on the ground,&quot; said Lt. Col. Terry Branham, whocommands a squadron of Apaches likely to make one of thefirst runs against Iraqi tanks.   The Apache has been subject to some criticism about itsreliability in the past, but the helicopters in Saudi Arabiahave been especially outfitted for desert operations.   The Iraqi defense will be formidable, however. It has 130attack helicopters that are &quot;almost as maneuverable as ours,&quot;Col. Branham said. And knocking out those helicopters was&quot;not a priority during the initial air strikes,&quot; he added.That means that nearly one-third of the pilots in thesquadron are assigned to engage enemy helicopters inair-to-air combat.   The Apaches are also equipped with night sights as well asradar systems intended to help them strike targets at adistance of five miles or more.   The attacks, likely to occur at night, aren't expected tobegin until the Iraqi tanks have committed themselves tomoving toward U.S. positions. &quot;The plan is to do something tomake them move,&quot; said Lt. Gen. Frederick Franks, thecommander in chief of the Army's VII Corps.   In addition to hundreds of Apaches, tank-killing A-10 jetshave also been moved closer to Iraqi targets. The stepped-upactivity in preparation for a ground offensive is alsoevident in the huge convoys carrying ammunition, fuel andearth-moving equipment northward in Saudi Arabia.</TEXT></DOC>
