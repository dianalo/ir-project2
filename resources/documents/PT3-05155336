No. 07/467,808 filed      on Jan. 19, 1990, now abandoned. </PAR></PARN><BSUM> <PAR>  This invention relates generally to a rapid thermal heating apparatus and      method for heating substrates and more particularly to such an apparatus      which includes spatial control of the substrate heating. </PAR><PAC>  BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  In the semiconductor industry, it is desirable to obtain temperature      uniformity in the substrate during temperature cycling of substrate.      Temperature uniformity provides uniform process variables on the substrate      (e.g. layer thickness, resistivity, etch depth) for temperature activated      steps such as film deposition, oxide growth and etching. In addition,      temperature uniformity in the substrate is necessary to prevent thermal      stress-induced wafer damage such as warpage, defect generation and slip. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 1 schematically shows a prior art flood type rapid thermal heating      apparatus in which a wafer 11 disposed in chamber 12 is heated by      radiation from a plurality of lamps 13. This type of heating apparatus      does not provide adequate spatial control of temperature. The primary      difficulty is that different areas on the wafer may have different energy      absorption or emissivity characteristics. For example, if a flood heating      source (assuming uniform illumination across the wafer) is used to heat a      wafer during a rapid thermal processing cycle in which the      thermally-isolated wafer may be ramped in temperature on the order of      10.degree.-300.degree. C./sec, the edge will maintain a different      temperature than the middle because the edge can accept radiant energy      from or emit radiant energy to a wider field of view. FIG. 2 shows the      temperature at the center and edges of a wafer as a function of time for a      flood type heating source During the temperature ramp-up portions of the      heating cycle the edges will be hotter than the center while during the      steady state and ramped-down portions the edges will be cooler than the      center. These edge to center temperature differences create radial      stresses in a wafer which if large enough, can damage the wafer, and are      not tolerable in many processes, especially high temperature processes in      which the mechanical strength of the wafer is substantially reduced. For      example, at 1150.degree. C. the center to edge temperature difference on a      four inch silicon wafer of approximately 5.degree. C. can induce      dislocation formation and slip. Some conventional flood heating sources,      such as a bank of tungsten-halogen lamps or a single arc lamp, can be      modified to compensate for center-to-edge temperature differences of one      sign, for example, during the temperature ramp up. Shading or reflectors      can be used to provide more light energy to the center of the wafer as      compared to the edge, but it is impossible for such a heating source to      provide temperature uniformity during all parts of the thermal cycle. </PAR><PAR>  Temperature gradients can also be induced by other sources. For example, a      wafer may have non-uniform emissivity because of spatial modifications to      surface areas or volumes of the wafer. These modifications could include      films which have been patterned by photo lithography or locally doped      regions such as buried layers for bipolar transistors. In addition, the      temperature gradients can be induced by localized gas cooling or heating      effects, as well as non-uniform endothermic or exothermic reactions which      may occur on the substrate surface during processing. </PAR><PAC>  OBJECTS AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  It is a general object of this invention to provide an improved heat source      for rapid thermal processing of semiconductor wafers or substrates. </PAR><PAR>  It is a further object of this invention to provide a heat source which      allows spatial control of the heat energy applied to the substrate. </PAR><PAR>  It is another object of this invention to provide a heat source which      enables spatial control of the heat applied to a wafer or substrate to      maintain temperature uniformity despite localized variations in the      ability of the wafer to emit or absorb heat energy. </PAR><PAR>  It is another object of this invention to provide a heat source which      includes a plurality of independently controlled heat sources which      provide energy to predetermined overlapping areas of a substrate or wafer. </PAR><PAR>  It is a further object of this invention to provide a heat source including      a plurality of independently controlled heat sources each providing energy      to a predetermined area of a substrate or wafer and sensors for sensing      the temperature of said area to permit control of applied energy to      maintain uniform temperature across the wafer. </PAR><PAR>  It is still a further object of this invention to provide a heat source      which includes a plurality of light pipes, each of which directs energy      from an energy source onto predetermined overlapping areas of a wafer or      substrate. </PAR><PAR>  It is a further object of this invention to provide an improved light pipe      heat source and a process chamber window assembly. </PAR><PAR>  The foregoing and other objects of this invention are achieved by a heat      source which includes a plurality of sources of radiant energy each      serving to radiate a predetermined area of the substrate, and means for      mounting the sources of radiant energy next to each other so that portions      of the radiated areas of adjacent sources overlap and the energy intensity      at said portions from the different sources add, and a control means for      controlling the intensity of each of said sources of radiant energy      whereby to control the intensity of radiation at different areas on said      wafer or substrate. </PAR><PAR>  More particularly, the invention includes a plurality of radiant energy      sources each associated with a light pipe mounted next to another light      pipe with the light pipes serving to direct radiant energy from the      associated source towards the substrate to radiate a predetermined area of      the substrate with a pattern of relative radiant intensity. The light      pipes are spaced so that a portion of the radiated area of adjacent light      pipes overlaps so that the intensity of radiation at said portions adds to      provide a relative intensity across the wafer which is dependent upon the      intensity of a combination of said radiant energy sources. </PAR></BSUM><DRWD> <PAC>  BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS </PAC><PAR>  The foregoing and other objects of the invention will be more clearly      understood from the following description when read in connection with the      accompanying drawings, of which: </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 1 is a schematic representation of a rapid thermal heating source in      accordance with the prior art. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 2 shows the temperature of a wafer as a function of time at the center      and edge when the wafer is radiated with a flood type source. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 3 is a cross sectional view of a rapid thermal heating apparatus in      accordance with one embodiment of the present invention taken generally      along the line 3--3 of FIG. 4. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 4 is a sectional view of a rapid thermal heating apparatus in      accordance with the present invention taken along the line 4--4 of FIG. 3. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 5 is an enlarged view showing a light pipe and temperature sensing      pipe in accordance with the present invention. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 6 is an enlarged view of a portion of the vacuum window shown in FIG.      3. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 7 shows the relative intensity of radiation from a light pipe, as a      function of distance across the light pipe for two surface finishes. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 8 is a curve illustrating radiation as a function of wavelength for      incident and emitted energy. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 9 is a schematic view of a rapid thermal heating apparatus including      an infrared camera viewing the front of a wafer being processed. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 10 is a schematic diagram of a typical control circuit which can be      used to control the rapid thermal heating apparatus in accordance with the      invention. </PAR></DRWD><DETD> <PAC>  DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </PAC><PAR>  Referring to FIGS. 3 and 4, the apparatus of this invention is shown      associated with an evacuated process chamber 13. The walls of the chamber      are schematically shown at 14. The apparatus forms the upper wall of the      chamber and is sealed thereto by O rings 16 which cooperate with the      window assembly 17 to be presently described. A radiant energy light pipe      assembly 18 is shown overlying the window 17. The radiant energy assembly      includes a plurality of tungsten-halogen lamps 19, for example Sylvania      EYT lamps, each mounted inside of a light pipe 21 which may be of      stainless steel, brass, aluminum or other metal. The ends of the pipes are      brazed or welded to openings in upper and lower cooling chamber walls 22      and 23. A cylindrical wall 24 is brazed or welded to the peripheral edge      of the walls 22 and 23 and together therewith defines a cooling chamber      26. Coolant, such as water, is introduced into the chamber via the inlet      27 and is removed at the outlet 28. Referring particularly to FIG. 4, the      fluid travels in the space between the various light pipes and serves to      cool the light pipes. Baffles 29 may be included to ensure proper flow of      fluid through the chamber. </PAR><PAR>  Lamps 19 include a filament wound as a coil with its axis parallel to that      of the lamp envelope. Most of the light is emitted perpendicular to this      axis towards the walls of the surrounding light pipe. In FIG. 5 the      preferred assembly of the lamp 19 in the light pipe 21 is shown. An upper      stainless steel sleeve 31 is placed in the light pipe and a lower      stainless steel sleeve 32 is also placed in the light pipe. The interior      surface of the sleeve 32 is gold plated to prevent the surface from      oxidizing and to maintain a high level of reflectivity. It has been found      that when the gold is plated directly onto the stainless steel sleeve 32,      and the sleeve is heated by radiation from the lamp, the gold diffuses      into the stainless steel and loses some of its reflectivity. This problem      was solved by using a nickel diffusion barrier between the stainless steel      and the gold. The nickel barrier was applied using standard electroless      nickel plating techniques, and then the high purity gold was applied by      gold plating. </PAR><PAR>  About half of the radiant energy from the lamp goes out of the end of the      associated light pipe after many reflections. The other half is absorbed      at the base of the lamp. This can cause the base of the lamp to reach much      higher temperatures as compared to a lamp radiating in open space. If the      base gets too hot the average lamp lifetime can be substantially reduced.      This lamp degradation is caused by rupture in the seal around the      molybdenum plates 33 which carry the electrical energy to the filament.      Above about 300.degree. C. the molybdenum is easily oxidized and the      resulting molybdenum oxide causes a volume expansion which ruptures the      quartz or causes an open circuit. Thus, it was necessary to provide a      means for cooling the lamp base. By placing a metal such as a solder alloy      36 between the sleeve 31 and lamp base 34, which can easily be melted in      place, excellent heat transfer is provided through the metal to the      surrounding stainless steel wall 31. This allows the base 34 of the lamp      to operate at acceptable temperatures. The solder can be applied by first      placing a ceramic potting 37 to form a dam and then applying the metal in      the space between the base 34 and the cylinder 31. The assembly may then      be potted with a ceramic potting 38. </PAR><PAR>  A second lamp failure mechanism occurs when the temperature of the envelope      increases above 550.degree. C. At this temperature the quartz envelope      begins to react with the gas species within the envelope. Furthermore, the      envelope softens enough to balloon or blister since tungsten halogen bulbs      operate with very high internal gas pressure. This problem is alleviated      by inserting a precision ground quartz sleeve 39 between the bulb envelope      and the gold plated reflective sleeve 32 thus providing a better heat      conduction path than air. </PAR><PAR>  Lamp lifetimes can also be extended by operating the lamps at less than the      rated voltage since in general the lifetime is exponentially dependent      upon the applied voltage. Thus by lowering the voltage the lifetime can be      greatly increased. </PAR><PAR>  The light pipe length is selected to at least be as long as the associated      lamp. It may be made longer provided that the power reaching the wafer is      not substantially attenuated by increased reflections. FIG. 7 shows that      for a cylindrical pipe, a polished surface results in a more focused      intensity profile than a pipe with a sandblasted finish. The intensity      scans of FIG. 7 were obtained by scanning a monitor across the end of a      light pipe. Thus, the area and intensity pattern of the radiation can be      controlled by control of the surface finish. </PAR><PAR>  The pipe geometry, cross sectional shape, length, spatial layout and the      finish may be empirically optimized to provide uniform illumination or any      desired spatial intensity profile. This may be achieved by measuring the      spatial intensity profile of a single lamp light pipe and then using a      computer program to sum the intensity profiles of multiple lamp light      pipes by linear superposition. Thus, by controlling the critical      parameters such as the gold sleeve finish, lamp spacing and shape of the      light pipes to control the overlap of radiation from adjacent light pipes,      one is able to achieve a uniform intensity profile which can then be      modulated by controlling the lamp power to individual lamps to provide      dynamic temperature uniformity or simply improved steady state uniformity. </PAR><PAR>  The radiant energy source 19 comprising the plurality of light pipes and      associated lamps allows the use of thin quartz windows to provide an      optical port for heating a substrate within the evacuated process chamber.      Conventional vacuum illuminating and heating systems require a quartz      window which is relatively thick to withstand atmospheric pressure. The      window can become very hot by absorbing infrared light from the hot      substrate or from the heating source itself. A hot quartz window has      several disadvantages for vacuum processing chambers. The window's sealing      material may decompose. Substrate cooling rates are reduced thus reducing      throughput or productivity of the processing machine. Reactive gasses may      thermally decompose and plate out on the window causing decreased and      nonuniform window transmission properties. The hot quartz window will emit      black body radiation in the regions of the spectrum which are used to      sense wafer temperature using optical pyrometers. Such interference      increases the complexities of accurate wafer temperature measurements. </PAR><PAR>  In accordance with the preferred embodiment of the present invention, a      water cooled quartz window assembly 17 shown in greater detail in FIG. 6      is employed. The window assembly includes short light pipes 41 which are      brazed to upper and lower flange plates 42 and 43 which have their outer      edges sealed to wall 44. Cooling water is injected into the space 46      between light pipes and serves to cool the light pipes and flanges. The      light pipes register with the light pipes 21 of the illuminator. The water      cooled flange with the light pipe pattern which registers with the lamp      housing is sandwiched between two quartz plates, 47 and 48. These plates      are sealed to the flange with O rings 49 and 51 near the periphery of the      flange. The upper and lower flange plates 42 and 43 include grooves 52      which provide communication between the light pipes. A vacuum is produced      in the pipes by pumping through a tube 53 connected to one of the pipes      which in turn is connected to the rest of the pipes by the very small      recesses or grooves 52 in the face of the flange. Thus, when this sandwich      structure is placed on a vacuum chamber the metal flanges, typically      stainless steel which have excellent mechanical strength, provide adequate      structural support. The lower quartz window, the one actually sealing the      vacuum chamber, experiences little or no pressure differential because of      the vacuum on each side, and thus can be made very thin. </PAR><PAR>  The adapter plate concept allows quartz windows to be easily changed for      cleaning or analysis. In addition, the vacuum between the quartz windows      of the adapter plate provides an extra level of protection against toxic      gasses escaping the reaction chamber. Any changes in the pressure of this      vacuum is used to detect window rupture. Once detected, a safety interlock      signal can cause the reactor to be purged and restored to a secure      condition. </PAR><PAR>  In order to adjust the radiation intensity of the lamps, it is required      that the temperature of the substrate or wafer be measured. Temperature      distribution of a wafer may be monitored using thermocouples. It is      difficult, however, to attach many thermocouples to a wafer to attain      temperature uniformity data with good spatial resolution. In addition,      thermocouples themselves will alter the local heating and cooling of the      wafer and can lead to erroneous temperature measurements. The technique of      attaching thermocouples may not be used when actually processing wafers      and thus is only useful in setting up and calibrating the equipment. </PAR><PAR>  Another technique is to use an infrared camera such as a camera made by      Agema which can be focused on the back or front side of the wafer and used      to sense infrared radiation emitted by the wafer. Referring to FIG. 9,      camera 61 is shown viewing the backside of the wafer 52, which is      illuminated by illuminator 18. The camera senses radiation in the      wavelength region of 8-12 micrometers emitted by the wafer. No light from      the heating source is detected because all light with wavelengths above      about four micrometers is absorbed by the quartz window. The infrared      camera can detect differences of less than 3.degree. C. for temperatures      of up to 1,200.degree. C. with a spatial resolution of better than 1/10 of      an inch on a six inch diameter silicon wafer. In addition, color coded      thermal maps of the wafer temperature can be stored at rates of many times      per second and thus the wafer temperature uniformity can be monitored      during rapid thermal ramps. With the use of a camera, it is possible to      obtain temperature uniformity by simply manually adjusting the electrical      power applied to each of the individual lamps. Alternately, the camera may      be associated with an optical pickup that detects the radiation pattern      and feeds a video input to a computer which can then control silicon      controlled rectifiers or other power supplies for each of the bulbs to      maintain the correct temperature uniformity across the wafer. </PAR><PAR>  However, in a commercial machine it may be too expensive to use a separate      infrared camera on each reactor because of the high cost and also because,      in many cases, gas injectors and other process hardware obscure the view      of the wafer. It is thus desirable to measure the wafer temperature from      the illuminated side. </PAR><PAR>  In accordance with another feature of the present invention the spaces      between the, light pipes is provided with small hollow pipes 58 (FIG. 5)      to provide a path for light emitted by the wafer to reach an optical      pyrometer detector. </PAR><PAR>  Referring now to FIG. 5, a pyrometer or detector 66 is shown cooperating      with an adapter 57 which is connected to the light pipe 58 extending      between the upper and lower flanges 22 and 23. A filter 59 is inserted in      front of the pyrometer and is selected to pass infrared energy of      wavelength region 4.8-5.2 micrometers which is outside of the wavelength      region passed by the quartz window. Thus light from the lamps does not      interfere with the radiation from the wafer picked up by the detector. </PAR><PAR>  In the window assembly the quartz windows 47 and 48 adjacent the light pipe      58 are shown as being cut out and fitted with sapphire windows 60 which      transmit light of wavelength out to about 6.5 micrometers. Thus, light      from the wafer is allowed to pass through the sapphire windows up through      the light pipe 58 through the filter 59 and to the detector 66 which      provides an output signal which is indicative of the surface temperature      of the wafer within the field of view of the light pipe. </PAR><PAR>  Referring to FIG. 8, the lamp and wafer radiation wavelengths is shown by      the labeled curves. The filter 59 bandpass is shown by the window 60      between the quartz cut-off and sapphire cut-off wavelengths. It is seen      that the energy is primarily wafer energy. </PAR><PAR>  The dimensions of the light pipe may typically be 0.15 inches in diameter      and five inches long. This geometry ensures that the area of the wafer      sampled by the pyrometer is small simply because the acceptance angle for      such a light pipe is small. Many pyrometers can be used to sample many      areas of the wafers. </PAR><PAR>  Using proportional, integration, and differentiation software the power to      groups of lamps close to each pyrometer is controlled to control the      energy applied to localized areas. Using this technique dynamic wafer      temperature uniformity is automated. The temperature of a substrate is      thus controlled as a function of time and position. A desired temperature      versus time profile can be entered into a control computer and multiple      pyrometer feedback loops will ensure that the wafer temperature is uniform      and maintained throughout the thermal cycle. An added benefit of this      technique is that temperature uniformity can be achieved despite changes      in optical properties of the process chamber or previous thermal history,      thus eliminating chamber memory effects which plague so many reactors      commonly in use. Lamp grouping with pyrometers is simplified by rotating      the wafers because lamps can then be assigned pyrometer control loops      according to radii. This drastically reduces the number of pyrometers and      control loops needed. The wafer rotation will also improve the uniformity      of other process parameters such as gas injection and mass transport to      the wafer surface. </PAR><PAR>  Referring to FIG. 3, the wafer 61 is supported at its edge by spaced      support fingers 62 mounted on a support tube 63. The support 63 is      rotatably supported from the walls of the chambers 14 by a bearing      assembly 64. Magnets 66 are mounted on the support. The magnetic fields of      the magnets extend through the wall 14 and couple to magnets 67 mounted on      a drive ring 68 which is suitably driven (not shown). Rotation of the ring      causes the wafer support tube 63 and wafer to rotate. The magnetic      coupling eliminates the need for an elaborate vacuum sealed drive      assembly. </PAR><PAR>  Schematically shown is a gas injection head 69 for injecting processing      gases into the chamber 13 whereby various processing steps may be carried      out in the chamber. </PAR><PAR>  Referring to FIG. 10, there is schematically shown the control circuit for      a rapid thermal processing apparatus in accordance with the invention. The      temperature sensors 76 provide an analog output signal representative of      the annotated water temperature. The analog output signals are converted      by an A to D converter 72. The digital signals are applied to a computer      73. The desired temperature time profile is entered into the computer. The      computer then provides output digital signals responsive to the two inputs      rectifiers 74 which control the power to the individual lamps or a group      of lamps associated with each sensor. </PAR><PAR>  When a bulb burns out and a new bulb is installed, the new bulb must be      calibrated to maintain the bundle illumination profile. This is      accomplished by measuring the light output versus voltage characteristic      for each bulb using a calorimeter. Thus when a lamp is replaced, a lookup      table of scaling factors in the computer is updated to account for any      bulb differences. When a power command is given to any bulb, it is first      modified using the scaling factors and then sent to control the silicon      controlled rectifiers. </PAR><PAR>  Thus there has been provided a rapid thermal heating operation in which the      temperature profile of a wafer can be closely controlled to minimize      stress-induced wafer damage during wafer processing. </PAR></DETD><CLMS> <STM>  What is claimed is: </STM><NUM>  1. </NUM><PAR>  1.
