The Nasdaq National Market System's &quot;royalty&quot; is a small group of big OTC issues such as MCI Communications, Farmers Group and Apple Computer that account for much of the trading volume and lately have dominated the moves of the Nasdaq composite index.    The thousands of smaller issues that are the OTC market's traditional base, meanwhile, are getting far less attention. There are about 5,300 issues traded on Nasdaq, but a popular gauge of the market these days is the three-year-old Nasdaq 100 index, which measures only the 100 largest non-financial issues.    Mary Farrell, a PaineWebber analyst who studies OTC trends, says such a sharp differentiation didn't exist in the OTC market's 1970s bull run, when smaller stocks out-performed larger ones. But today, she says, Nasdaq is divided into three classes: the biggest brand-name issues, most of which could trade on the New York Stock Exchange if they wanted to; a middle tier that is like the 1970s OTC market; and a bottom tier &quot;where floats and trading characteristics are so limited that only a tiny portion of investors are comfortable investing here.&quot;    Although that bottom tier contains the stocks that many investors think of when they hear the term &quot;OTC,&quot; Nasdaq's top tier is nothing like the traditional OTC scene. With small investors shunning stocks since the crash, the major OTC action consists of big institutions trading big stocks. At the end of the first half, institutions held 33% of the market value of Nasdaq, and more than half of their holding was concentrated in 138 stocks that each have market capitalization of $500 million or more.    All of this changes the way analysts are viewing the Nasdaq composite index's 16% gain so far this year. The gain was made largely in a first-quarter rally, and the market has since stumbled. Analysts say part of the reason for the stumbling is that the late-1987 and early-1988 interest in undervalued smaller stocks -- while real -- wasn't nearly as strong as it seemed at the time.    &quot;The most important reason for the OTC market's inability to repeat its earlier performance,&quot; says Christine Callies, a Dean Witter Reynolds senior market analyst, may be that from the middle of the first quarter, &quot;the OTC rally was growing increasingly dependent on the top tier of a two-tier market.&quot;    Most recently, any buying interest has been focused on special situations and &quot;selected blue-chip equivalents,&quot; Ms. Callies says, &quot;while the rest of the market stagnates.&quot;    OTC traders have been saying for weeks that if only there were a &quot;megadeal&quot; or two involving their issues -- similar to the recent takeover fever on the Big Board -- a flood of buyers might return to their market. But Ms. Callies isn't so optimistic.    &quot;The history of stampedes in small stocks over the past eight years,&quot; she says in her regular OTC Counter Action report, shows that &quot;extensive preparation&quot; for a rally has already been in place before a huge deal or other spark ignites the market. In the present market, she says, &quot;the conditions supportive of a buying binge do not exist yet.&quot;    ---   PENNY-STOCK CRACKDOWN: Oklahoma regulators today will announce an administrative action against 11 salesmen, brokerage-firm principals and promoters allegedly involved in a penny-stock market manipulation case in which investors may have lost $300 million. Most of the funds, regulators said, went into stock of a Florida-based company that claimed it had a secret process for converting Costa Rican beach sand into gold. The regulators wouldn't identify the brokerage firm involved.    ---   PENNY SALE: Dalton Communications said it completed the sale of the Penny Stock Journal to Financial Data Systems. The price wasn't disclosed. Dalton's stock was unchanged at 3/16 bid.    ---   Friday's Market Activity   The Nasdaq composite index rose for the first time in six trading sessions, gaining 1.02, to 382.79. The index fell 5.80 for the week. For the month ending today, it's down 5.02, or 1.3%.    CEM advanced 2 to 20 1/2. Analysts told Dow Jones Professional Investor Report the company's participation in the American Electronics Association's conference in Monterey, Calif., gave the laboratory instruments maker fresh exposure.    Among the most active issues, MCI gained 5/8 to 23 3/4, and Sun Microsystems rose 1/8 to 28 3/8, while Intel slipped 1/8 to 24 7/8, and Oracle Systems lost 1/8 to 15 1/8.    Advancing issues outpaced decliners, 1,039 to 812. Volume remained light at 106 million shares, making the week one of Nasdaq's slowest of the year.    ---                       OTC Giants   Top 10 Nasdaq National Market System securities, measured in market value.
