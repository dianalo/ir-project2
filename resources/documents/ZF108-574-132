 The integration problem escalateswith a merger of equals, for example the Lotus DevelopmentCorp/Novell Inc merger.andP;  Successfully merging two equals meansorganizing management so responsibility is divided equally amongexecutives of both companies.andP;

 But that challenge can only be met ifpeople-integration issues are tackled first.andM;The company that grows by acquisition does so to feed more product into afixed-cost distribution system of salespersons.andP;  The idea is to become aneven bigger and more profitable company, which in the short run could resultfrom the elimination of redundant positions.andM;Most acquiring companies try to keep the top technical people in theoperation.andP;  Neal Ater, VP of product development at Goal Systems, Columbus,Ohio, personally determines whether he can work with the people in theacquisition candidate company, before the buy.andP;  Goal spent over $60 millionin the past year for four acquisitions, and so far the company has hung on tokey developers.andP;  (Goal acquired companies smaller than itself, avoiding theissues that often arise from mergers of equals.)andM;It is more difficult to wring a successful product integration from anunsuccessful people integration.andP;  The people must be brought on board first,the lines of authority clearly established and accepted, and then the toughtrade-off decisions made.andP;  If one party has the upper hand, usually by virtueof size, then the merger is likely to proceed more smoothly.andP;  If the twoparties are equal, stalemate is the most likely outcome.andM;Lotus CEO Jim Manzi deserves credit for his decisiviness in not pursuing theNovell merger, after Novell requested equal standing on the combined board.andO;Manzi could see the likely stalemates ahead and backed out.andP;  The integrationissues that a combined Lotus/Novell would have faced would have beenenormous.andM;A good example of a merger of equals is Legent, the merger of MorinoAssociates of Vienna, Va., and Duquesne Systems of Pittsburgh.andP;  After the two$50 million companies combined in early 1989, questions immediately followedabout product synergy and headquarters location.andM;Ever since the acquisition, the company has been struggling with managementissues.andP;  Now, Duquesne founder Glen Chatfield has resigned; Primer Computer'sJoe Henson is CEO and chairman; former chairman Mario Morino is a director;morino executive Peter Barris is president, reporting to Henson; and formerDuquesne executive Neal Pollon is executive vice president and vice chairman,reporting to Barris.andM;The organizational chart evolves in an attempt to evenly divideresponsibilities between executives of the two merged companies.andP;  The companyhas expended time and energy trying to merge its separate but equalorganizations into a cohesive whole.andM;The distractions of people-integration issues appear to have been costly.andP;  Inearly April, the compay announced disappointing second quarter results.andP;  WallStreet analysts punished the company, sending the stock price from about $27to $19.andP;  Revenue from the domestic sales of MICS declined for the thirdconsecutive quarter, and the company stated it did not anticipate any growthin sales this year.andM;Vice Chairman Pollon said that, after the merger; there was a disruption inthe selling effort behind MICS.andP;  In May, the company decided to support aMICS-dedicated salesforce.andM;The benefits of a merger are easier to understand when a big company acquiresa much smaller one.andP;  Legent's acquisition of Business Software Technology,Westborough, Mass., has worked well.andP;  BST is contributing $20 to $25 millionof Legent's revenue today.andP;  Paine Webber analyst Robert Therrien projects thecontribution could reach $100 million in three years.andP;  Here is a case where asuccessful product spreads out more rapidly in the marketplace by virtue of alarger distribution system.andP;  All Legent has to do is sell BST's Endevor.andM;The next challenge, integrating Endevor with the rest of the Legent productline, will not be so straightforward.andP;  Will the fact that Endeavor livesinside Legent help or hinder its development?andP;  Is Legent's management nowunited around one theme?andM;The companies' products are well-respected, and the market opportunities inautomated operations, change management and resource management are alignedwith solutions MIS management will need in the '90s.andP;  To exploit theopportunity, Legent must solve the people-integration issues, then get to theproduct integration that could deliver the next solution.andM;Another merger of equals that will be interesting to watch is MSA andMcCormack andamp; Dodge.andP;  The bloody sacking of Frank Dodge is the epitone offailure to deftly handle people-integration issues.andP;  If it had to happen, itcould have been handled in a nicer way than security guards preventingDodge's access to the building.andP;  What this portends for the future of thecombined enterprises, a combination of two longtime warring financialapplication vendors, one can only guess.andM;That acquisitions create integration challenges is known by no company betterthan Computer Associates.andP;  The firm's recently announced CA90s softwareintegration blueprint is an attempt to federate a financially driven patternof acquisitions over the years.andM;First Charles Wang wanted to be a $1 billion company, then a $10 billioncompany, and now $100 billion?andM;CA created its own integration challenges by acquiring many companies.andP;  Withnearly 300 software products now, the company will have to separate cash cowsfrom those that will receive investments for the future.andM;Whether CA will ever deliver on its integration intention is a story to bewritten.andP;  To its credit, the company has pushed the right buzzword buttonswith its CA90s integration blueprint.andP;  Not all companies with an acquisitionstrategy talk about integration.andM;Wherever a software supplier can adopt an integration standard, it saves timeand money, and allows the supplier to concentrate on some functionalcomponent that is probably the source of real value.andM;If well-executed software company acquisitions do drive the evolution ofsoftware integration technology, they should be seen as a positive force.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
