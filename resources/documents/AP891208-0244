(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Midcontinent Airlines Inc., a regionalcarrier that had been scaled down since Braniff Inc.'s bankruptcyfiling, has ceased operations indefinitely.   About 35 Midcontinent employees in Kansas City have been laidoff, Chairman Steve Gillette said Thursday. The carrier had nearly50 workers in its system, he said.   Midcontinent had been a commuter carrier feeding passengers toBraniff flights out of Kansas City International Airport, using thename Braniff Express.   Braniff, based in Orlando, Fla., filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcyprotection in late September _ its second such filing in sevenyears. The airline has ceased operations.   Midcontinent, using a dozen planes at its peak with 46departures from the Kansas City airport, could not recover fromBraniff's shutdown, Gillette said.   He said few travelers would be affected by Midcontinent'sshutdown. The carrier has had small passenger loads in its 19-seatplanes since attempting to operate independently. Midcontinenthalted all flights after Braniff's reorganization filing butstarted up again using three planes in mid-October.   With about 15 flights a day to six cities, Midcontinent hadfilled only about 30 percent of its seats since restarting,Gillette said.   Midcontinent will try to start back up early next year after arestructuring that will require more capital, Gillette said. Theairline does not intend to file for bankruptcy protection at thispoint, he said.   Midcontinent plans to come back as a regional carrier and serveMidwestern cities that need more flights to and from Kansas City,Gillette said.   He declined to release information about the company's assets orliabilities.
