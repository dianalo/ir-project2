Such a man can, so to speak, lead the world by the nose.    And such a man is the repulsive protagonist of &quot;Perfume.&quot; Jean-Baptiste Grenouille is born without an odor, but he's also a superstar of scent, a fragrance fanatic, a mad genius capable of creating and cloaking himself in any aroma.    Babe Ruth could read license plates on approaching cars before the ordinary man could make out their color. To have eyesight as extraordinary as Grenouille's sense of smell, the Babe would have had to be able to read the numbers before others could see the car. Not only can Grenouille smell for distance. He can pick out the ingredients in the mingled odors of a city street. What's more, he's the greatest perfume maker of all time.    With such a gift, naturally one sets high goals. Grenouille wants &quot;nothing less than to revolutionize the odoriferous world.&quot; It's his kingdom and his only passion. The trouble is, his plans involve killing people. Not just random people, but those who smell particularly delicious, and these are &quot;ripening, but virginal&quot; girls. After the murders, Grenouille robs his victims of their scents, which he distills into an essence so irresistible it sends crowds into orgiastic frenzy, reduces his bitterest enemy to a slobbering admirer and generally proves that in a world of numbed noses the keen smeller can be king.    Grenouille also leaves a trail of other corpses -- not killed by his hand, but simply dead of their bad luck in having come across this carrier of evil. Anyone who gives him hospitality meets a sudden death after the ghastly little perfumer moves on.    Not all of what goes on in this novel adds up, but that's OK by fairy-tale rules, and Mr. Suskind makes clear from his first page that he is writing in the tradition established by the Brothers Grimm. In the translation from the German by John E. Woods, the fairy-tale tone is maintained without cloying.    As in many fairy tales, the world of &quot;Perfume&quot; is peopled by the brutish, vain and selfish. It stinks of the foul smells of man and beast. Cruelty is everywhere. And, as in many oft-told tales, &quot;Perfume&quot; -- which is set in 18th-century France -- carries many messages, inviting readers to find parables in almost every episode. Grenouille's lack of odor, of course, can be read as symbolic of an absence of identity. He's a hollow man, a chameleon of character. But most of &quot;Perfume's&quot; messages are about the follies of mankind.    Man preys upon man. Innocence goes unrewarded. The rich are fools; the poor worse fools. Mr. Suskind's misanthropic message isn't the newest of ideas, but his ingenuity packs it with fresh power. Grenouille grows into as compelling a heartless fiend -- maddened by an uncaring world -- as you could ask for.    Grenouille's childhood is a wonderfully drawn story of brutal treatment at the hands of hardhearted adults who recognize there's something odd about this odorless child, but can't quite put their finger on what it is.    The fantastic orgy Grenouille later touches off in Grasse after mastering the powers of perfume, and Grenouille's even more fairy-talelike final act in Paris hold attention even as they stretch credulity.    While &quot;Perfume&quot; is built on a specially elaborate conceit, suspense writers long have known that a good gimmick or a framework of esoteric expertise carries a tale wonderfully well. Where Mr. Suskind has turned to olfaction to speed his story along, Richard Pollak has built his suspense novel &quot;The Episode&quot; (New American Library, 314 pages, $16.95) around an epileptic fit.    Mr. Pollak's extensive knowledge of epilepsy gives the book many of its best moments. Like his protagonist Daniel Cooper, Mr. Pollak is an epileptic. He manages to deliver a lot of information about his disease without becoming didactic. And, in his hands, the epileptic seizure becomes a nifty plot device.    An epileptic episode can temporarily black out memory more completely than bourbon. So Cooper is helpless to defend himself when he comes out of an episode to find himself a murder suspect.    &quot;The Episode&quot; also makes nice use of 1980s New York. It has Upper West Side, middle-class verisimilitude. Cooper, an investigative reporter for a Village Voice-type newspaper, lives near Central Park, where he jogs regularly. He's a sympathetic and familiar character. So's his girlfriend Kate Bernstein, up to a point. The only problem with her is that she's out-of-this-world wonderful. Some might say she's better than Cooper deserves and wonder why she puts up with him, but she answers that herself by noting that there aren't a lot of men out there to choose from.    &quot;The Episode&quot; includes rent strikers, rapacious real-estate developers, drugs, corrupt cops and lazy, uncaring doctors. Throw in a world-champion baseball team and you'd have the complete picture.    ---   Mr. Lescaze is deputy foreign editor of the Journal. </TEXT></DOC>
