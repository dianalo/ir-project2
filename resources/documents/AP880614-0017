And she's abrillant woman. People send her computer problems to find bugs. ...She is the most incredible human being.''   ``Contrary to what you may have read _ how my brothers led mewith an iron fist and how my mother was domineering _ that's reallynot true. Even as a teenager, I was very much in control of thethings I was doing.''   ``I think its important to say, too, that my beliefs don't comefrom my parents,'' Osmond said. ``I am a member of my Mormon faithbecause I want to be.''   About her career plans, Osmond said: ``I would love to go intofilms. ... I would not get into nudity or anything like that ...and maybe that will be the thing that will keep me from doing majorparts.''</TEXT><DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Actress Bernadette Peters couldn't refuse therole of the mother of David Rothenberg, a boy set afire by hisvengeful father, in a based-on-fact TV movie.

The 1,600 paintings of Swiss Baron Heinrich Thyssen-Bornemiszaare regarded as the finest art collection in private hands afterthat of Queen Elizabeth II. They are conservatively valued at $1.41billion.   There has been a fierce international competition for thecollection, with Spain regarded as the favorite. The baron,grandson of the Ruhr steel magnate who armed the German forces inWorld War I, has made a commitment to Spain to show most of hispaintings in Madrid for at least 10 years.   But government sources in London said Monday that Mrs. Thatcherhas written the baron.   A spokesman for the Thyssen-Bornemisza Foundation said Mondaythat a long-term proposal ``may have been received from the Britishgovernment,'' but no decision had been made. Its commitment toSpain remained unaffected by any proposals from Britain, thespokesman said.   Prince Charles reportedly broke away from a vacation in Italy tovisit Thyssen at his Lake Lugano home May 4 to discuss thelong-term future of the collection.   On May 21, Mrs. Thatcher sent Cabinet Secretary Sir Robin Butlerto Switzerland for further talks at the baron's home. The primeminister followed up her offer of a purpose-built gallery for thecollection in a two-page, handwritten letter, the domestic newsagency Press Association said.   Roger de Grey, president of Britain's Royal Academy of Arts,said Charles and Mrs. Thatcher had done everything possible to seethat Britain did not miss a great opportunity.   ``The intervention of Prince Charles is the sort of thing thatwould count in the baron's mind,'' said de Grey.   The Times said the 67-year-old baron has been concerned aboutthe disposition of the collection, begun by his father but brokenup at the order of the Swiss courts at his father's death.   Thyssen was adamant that the collection should remain basicallyintact, the Times said, in a country prepared to give it arespectful home.   Switzerland, West Germany and the Getty Foundation in LosAngeles are also competing for the chance to house the collection.</TEXT></DOC>
