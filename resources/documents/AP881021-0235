The November contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmarkU.S. crude, plunged 80 cents Thursday to close at $14.60 a42-gallon barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.   On Wednesday, the November contract soared 79 cents, following a60-cent drop the previous session. During the course of Thursday'strading, the contract traded as low as $14.25 and as high as $15.30.   Analysts said the extreme volatility has reflected the waningand waxing of traders' hopes that the Organization of PetroleumExporting Countries can agree to cap its runaway overproduction andstabilize the price of oil.   ``The market lived and died completely on rumors of whether thisOPEC agreement will come together,'' said Peter Beutel, anassistant director at Elders Futures Inc.   OPEC's strategy and pricing committees were meeting Thursday inMadrid, Spain, but the session had not begun by the close oftrading on the mercantile exchange.   Rumors that Iran would refuse to join its fellow OPEC members inan agreement sparked the heavy selling, Beutel said.   Overproduction by the 13-nation cartel sent the price of oilskidding below the $12.30-a-barrel mark recently, but pricesrecovered somewhat as Thursday's session drew near.   Estimates of the cartel's daily output have ranged as high as 22million barrels of oil. Members of the six-nation Gulf CooperationCouncil, several of whom are OPEC members, have proposed an overallceiling of 18.5 million to 19 million barrels a day.   Analysts expect trading to remain volatile even after theconclusion of the Madrid conference because OPEC has scheduled afull ministerial meeting on Nov. 21.   Beutel called the market confused, adding, ``We're just waitingto find out what OPEC's going to do.''   Refined products traded on the Mercantile Exchange were mixedThursday. The November contract for home heating oil fell 0.79 centto close at 43.06 cents a gallon. However, the November contractfor wholesale unleaded gasoline rose 0.29 cent to settle at 49.35cents a gallon.   Beutel said gasoline futures were higher because of tightsupplies in the cash market.</TEXT></DOC>
