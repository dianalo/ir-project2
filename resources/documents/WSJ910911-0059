Once approved by the cabinet, therevision will be considered by the Diet, or parliament.   Under the new regulations, securities companies couldn'tguarantee compensation for trading losses or any level ofreturn on market investments. Clients couldn't seek losscompensation.   Under current law, such compensation is illegal only if aprior agreement for it existed between brokers and clients.   Jail sentences and fines could be imposed on violatorsunder the new proposal. The revision also would outlawdiscretionary accounts, in which clients entrustresponsibility for their investments to brokerage houses.Such accounts are widely viewed as promoting losscompensation.                                                                                                          KUWAIT MAY RESCUE BANKS                                                                                                          The Kuwaiti government provisionally approved a centralbank plan to reform the banking sector, which is saddled withbad loans resulting from the Iraqi invasion and a stockmarket crash 10 years ago. The central bank wants to takelocal banks' bad loans off the books and transfer them to anew government institution, which would try to recover themoney over a 20-year period. People in the banking industrysaid the new institution would be taking over about 5.3billion dinars ($18.03 billion) of doubtful loans, theequivalent of the entire loan portfolio of the nine principalKuwaiti banks at the time of the August 1990 invasion.                                                                                                          LATVIA SEEKS TO JOIN EBRD                                                                                                          The Baltic states of Latvia and Estonia, which havedeclared independence from the Soviet Union, applied formembership in the European Bank for Reconstruction andDevelopment. The London-based bank was created last April tofoster private-sector development in Eastern Europe throughaid, technical assistance and direct equity investment.                                                                                                          ITALY'S TOURIST MECCAS HUMBLED                                                                                                          Florence, Venice and Rome, long the most popular touristsites in Italy, had a humbling fall in the number of visitorsthis summer and are scrambling to find new ways to competewith beach and mountain resorts. Hotel occupancy in the threecities in July and August fell as much as 30% from a yearearlier, officials and hoteliers said, while overall tourismin Italy this summer rose 2%. The three ancient culturalcenters, estimated to have about onefourth of the world's arttreasures, intend to lower prices and improve services.                                                                                                          KOREAN OPPOSITION'S OUTLOOK                                                                                                          The merger of South Korea's two main opposition partiesdoesn't spell defeat for the conservative ruling party innext year's National Assembly election, analysts said. TheNew Democratic Party of Kim Dae Jung merged with the smallerDemocratic Party of Lee Ki Taek. Citing the two leaders' pastdifferences, some analysts doubt the merged party can holdtogether much past the election. The unified oppositioncontrols 80 seats in the 299-member assembly, and isn'texpected to capture a ballot majority, given Mr. Kim's waningpopularity in Seoul.                                                                                                          JAPAN'S BANK LENDING SINKS                                                                                                          Japanese bank lending volume in August grew 5.5% from ayear earlier, the smallest rise ever, the Bank of Japan said.In July, the year-to-year increase was 6%. Bank of Japanofficials said the slower growth last month stemmed fromdiminished demand for cash by small and medium-sizedcompanies, and the need for banks to meet internationalcapital-adequacy requirements, the Kyodo news agencyreported.                                                                                                          FIRMS ALTER MEXICAN STRATEGY                                                                                                          Multinational companies with lines in Mexico are expandingtheir domestic sales focus to include exports to the rest ofNorth America and other global markets, said the MexicanInvestment Board, a nonprofit organization run jointly by thegovernment and private financial institutions.   The strategy change resulted from an improved economic andinvestment climate in Mexico, according to aboard-commissioned study of 40 companies based in the U.S.,Germany and Japan.   Two-thirds of those surveyed, and almost all the Japaneseconcerns that responded, are expanding their Mexican lines byadding capacity, building plants, entering joint ventures oracquiring local companies.   Nearly all the respondents are profitable in Mexico. Theycited as advantages the Mexican market's size, the local workforce's quality and cost-effectiveness, availability ofresources and access to markets. Among the disadvantages:pollution in metropolitan and industrial areas, and the highcost of capital. The prospect of a free trade accord amongthe U.S., Canada and Mexico underpinned the companies'confidence in expanding to serve international markets.
