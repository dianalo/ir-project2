The technique employed is based on an optical radarapproach and proprietary coating materials whose optical losses and/orrefractive indices are a marked function of temperature. The techniquemay also be employed for the monitoring of transmission lines, sincethere are considerable economic factors involved with maintaining themaximum loading on a line without causing local overheating. The DistributedFiber-Optic Sensing System (DFOSS) can be said to employ FODAR (FiberOptic Detection and Ranging) techniques. Various materials have beenidentified that might be suitable for a distributed hot-spot sensor.The approach adopted here to obtain temperature-sensitivie optical fibersis to choose a special polymer material that can act like a core or cladding.In particular, coatings have been developed which are suitable as opticalcladdings for borosilicate types of fiber. These coatings change theiroptical properties, i.e., refractive index, scattering and absorption,as a function of temperature. 19 refs., 24 figs., 6 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
