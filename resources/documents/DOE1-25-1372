The pilot plantis designed as a multipurpose facility; its main functions are: unloadingand loading of spent fuel and radioactive waste containers from and intotransport storage casks; spent fuel disassembly and encapsulation infinal disposal casks and maintenance of transport/storage casks. ThePollux cask system which has been developed is suitable for final disposalof spent fuel and also for long term storage of radioactive materialin storage facilities. The system can be adapted to the requirementsof tunnel and borehole storage in final repositories. The pilot plantconsists of a main building in which the transport casks are receivedand dispatched, a T-shaped hot cell arrangement for spent fuel disassemblyand cask unloading/loading, a buffer storage cell and auxiliary systems.The maximum throughput is limited to 35 t HM/a. Hot commissioning isexpected to start in 1994, permitting final conditioning of disposalcasks as well as demonstration of the technical feasibility and licensabilityof the total process under hot conditions.
