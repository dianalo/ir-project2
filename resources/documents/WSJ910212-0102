It looks as ifU.S.-Soviet arms control may finally be reaching a dead end.   No one can come right out and say this, of course, sincethe &quot;arms-control process&quot; is a religious exercise. Everyonemust still profess faith in the cause, if not in the details,lest the high priests at the Arms Control Association rendtheir garments. Yet events are conspiring in ways that maketraditional arms control look like animist ritual --interesting to anthropologists but irrelevant to the modernworld.</LP><TEXT>   The proximate setback is the collapse of the conventionalforces in Europe agreement, or CFE, initialed only lastNovember. This was supposed to be headed for the Senate thismonth, but recent Soviet behavior has proved too much evenfor the State Department. &quot;What the Soviets are doing here isan outrage,&quot; says a senior U.S. negotiator.   What they've done is tear out the heart of the treaty.That heart is contained in the &quot;counting rules&quot; limitingpieces of military equipment in Europe -- tanks, artillerypieces and the like. Soviet military officials are now sayingthat anything called &quot;naval infantry&quot; or &quot;rocket forces&quot;isn't covered by the counting rules. It's as if Ford signed atreaty limiting car production with GM but later said theTaurus wasn't covered because it's a truck. And forevermoreFord gets to decide unilaterally which cars to call a Taurus.   Even before the treaty was signed, the Soviets had movedsome 60,000 tanks and armored pieces east of the UralMountains, where they won't be counted under the CFE limits.Technically this isn't a treaty violation, but it doesn't saymuch for Soviet intentions. What's more, U.S. and NATOofficials say the Soviets also undercounted their militaryhardware by several thousand pieces of equipment even afterNovember. This is definitely a treaty violation.   To some of us, none of this behavior is surprising. Thisis the way the Soviet military-political establishment hasalways acted. Mark CFE down with the Backfire bomber, theKrasnoyarsk radar, anti-missile defenses and every otherSoviet arms-control deceit or violation over the past 20years. When haven't they cheated? Ex-Foreign MinisterShevardnadze is the exception who proves the rule. His tenureexposed the Krasnoyarsk violation that other Soviets haddenied for a decade. And in resigning, he warned of&quot;dictatorship,&quot; saying in effect that his successors couldn'tbe trusted.   The mystery is why so many Americans continue to invest somuch time and faith in arms control. If it doesn't work evenwith reformers such as Mr. Shevardnadze at the helm, whyshould it work with Brezhnevite retreads pulling the strings?If it doesn't limit Soviet weapons, why should it limit ours?   Especially in light of the evidence from the Iraq war. ThePatriot missile's success has shown that the U.S. can have ananti-missile defense for Cleveland as well as for Tel Aviv.Yet the 1969 ABM Treaty-arms control's Golden Calf -- is saidby the high priests to ban missile defenses at all but oneU.S. site. So arms control blocks a defense against futureScuds.   Likewise, if we can't locate Scud launchers in a countryas small as Iraq, how do we expect to find mobile Sovietmissiles in a country with 11 time zones? Yet in the STARTtalks, Mr. Baker has agreed to the Soviet demand not to banmobile missiles. And the Soviets continue to roll out SS-24missiles (deployed on rail cars) and SS-25s (on trucks).START also limits cruise missiles, which the war has provedcan spare civilians and pilots through precision targetingfrom a distance.   Merits aside, we suspect all of this also changes thepolitics of arms control. With Mikhail Gorbachev imitatingBrezhnev, the Senate will have new doubts about any treaty.If Mr. Bush wins in Iraq, his foreign-policy record will beunassailable. And as domestic failure reduces Sovietinfluence around the world, the state of U.S.-Sovietrelations should become less a bellwether of foreign-policy&quot;success.&quot;   All of this means that the arms-controllers may have tofind new work, of course. We recommend they take up&quot;nonproliferation,&quot; which would try to block future Saddamsfrom gaining nuclear devices or chemical and missile weapons.This would let them declare that arms control isn't dead buthas merely adapted to &quot;the new world order.&quot; Nothing would sobecome arms control as such a demise.</TEXT></DOC>
