It should be cut from the ends of two 10-footpipes;    Fittings ( 3/4-inch);    10 T fittings;    Four slip-joint sideoutlet Ls (called SOLs);    Male adapters if SOLs are threaded;    Two crossfittings;    Four pipe supports (to hold the horizontal side supports);   Miscellaneous;    One package of 15-by-75-foot netting (about $30);    One canof PVC cement (one-half pint costs $1.60);    One roll wide plastic tree tie($2.40);    It will be less cumbersome to assemble the bird cage in threesegments. And, before gluing, make certain all the pieces fit togetherproperly.;    Here's how:;    (check) START WITH END UNIT (see Figure I):;   (box)  Base;    a) Connect two 5 1/2-foot pipes with a T fitting.;    b)Attach SOLs to the two free ends of the pipes.;    c) Insert one 6-foot sidebase pipe into each of the two SOLS.;    d) Put Ts, upside down, on the endsof the 6-foot pipes. They should be at 90-degree angles and flat.;    (box) Vertical Pipes;    e) Put a T on the end of a 7-foot pipe.;    f) Insert theopposite end of that pipe into the base T.;    g) Place pipe supports 6 feetup on the two 10-foot arch pipes.;    h) Put a cross on a 6-foot pipe.;    i)Cut 1 1/2 inches off the end of one of the two 10-foot pipes.;    j) Insertthe 1 1/2-inch pipe piece into a T. (This will connect with the end top Tlater).;    k) Put the opposite side of the T on the shortened arch.;    1)Put the 6-foot pipe into that T at right angles with the pipe.;    m) Put thearch pipe into the corner base SOL.;    n) Arch the pipe and insert the 11/2-inch pipe into the top end T. Voila! An arch.;    o) Insert the other10-foot pipe into the opposite SOL.;    p) Bend and insert the arch in theother side of the top T.;    q) Insert two more 10-foot pipes into the Ts onthe two free ends of the 6-foot base pipes.;    r) Arch the pipes to fit thecross at the end of the 6-foot top pipe.;    (check) SECOND END UNIT:;    s)Repeat the steps in the first end unit. Make sure the T with the 1 1/2-inchinsert is the same as the opposite end.;    (check) THE MIDDLE CONNECTION (SeeFigure II):;    t) Three 6-foot pipes remain. Insert one into the crossfittings to connect the top. The other two will connect the end units at thebase Ts.;    u) Put the 18-foot pipes into the side pipe supports on eachside.;    v) Make sure all pipes are glued before going to the next step.;   (check) NETTING (See Figure II):;    Bird netting is packaged in many sizes,but a 15-by-75-foot size is the most cost effective, eliminates piecing andleaves some for use elsewhere. You will need:;    Two 9-by-13-foot pieces tocover the ends;    Two 7-by-21-foot pieces for the arches;    One 8-by-21-footsection for the door curtain flap;    w) Tie the 9-by-13-foot pieces to eachend, keeping them taut.;    x) Cover the arched area on each side of the doorwith the two 7-by-21-foot pieces.;    y) Tie the center of the curtain pieceto the top center pipe. Allow the curtain to hang down on each side over thedoors.;    z) Tie an 8-foot piece of pipe to the bottom of each flap forweight.  </TEXT><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910627  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Thursday  </DAY><MONTH>  June  </MONTH><PG.COL>  2C  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  DIAGRAM  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  729  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Thursday June 27, 199100179136,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
