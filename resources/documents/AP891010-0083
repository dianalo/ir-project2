STEICHEN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   East German leader Erich Honocker today comparedthe pro-democracy uprising in China with the unrest in East Germanyand criticized what he said was a campaign to defame the Communistcountries.   Municipal officials took a softer line in the East German cityof Leipzig, however, allowing 70,000 protesters to rally for reformin the city center.   The official tolerance of Monday's peaceful march for an end toauthoritarian rule contrasted sharply with the violence police usedto break up similar demonstrations over the weekend in six EastGerman cities.   Despite the new tolerance in Leipzig, Honecker gave noindication that he is about to change his government's course.   In a meeting with Chinese Vice Premier Yao Yilin, he said:   ``Any attempt of imperialism to destabilize the socialistconstruction or to slander its successes and achievements is now,and will be in the future, nothing other than fruitless charging ofDon Quixote against the ever-moving blades of a windmill,'' theofficial news agency ADN quoted him as saying.   ADN said Honecker and Yao recalled the events of last June inBeijing, when troops crushed the Chinese pro-democracy movement.   ``In this respect, there is a fundamental lesson to be learnedfrom the counter-revolutionary revolt in Beijing and the presentdefamation campaign against the GDR (East Germany) and otherSocialist states,'' ADN said.   That statement appeared to signal Honecker's willingness tocrush dissent, if necessary.   Also today, Manfred Stolpe, deputy director of the LutheranChurch Federation, said there were ``working groups'' of governmentand church officials who were discussing the current unrest in EastGermany.   But he denied a West German radio report that said high-leveltalks had been held between church leaders and government officials.   Meanwhile, Hans Otto Furian, a Lutheran church provost in EastBerlin, said in an interview that ``positive developments in ournation can only come about if a new orientation breaks through.''   ``The Communist Party must give up its grip on total power,'' hesaid. ``It can't happen with anything less.''   Over the weekend, hundreds of people were arrested in EastBerlin, Leipzig, Dresden and other cities by club-swinging police.West German television said many already were sentenced to jailterms of up to six months.   Leipzig, an industrial city of 500,000, has been the scene ofseveral clashes in recent weeks as police moved to crushdemonstrations stirred in part by an exodus of disillusionedcitizens to the West.   After two nights of clashes in East Berlin, many feared policewould also use violence to break up Monday's peace march in Leipzig.   But beforehand, officials of the Leipzig Communist Partypromised to push for a talks between citizens and the government.``We all need a free exchange of ideas about how we should continuesocialism in our nation,'' the officials said in a statement.   The message was read over Leipzig state radio during services atfour city churches and over loudspeakers during the demonstration,witnesses said.   Police and paramilitary troops watched the Leipzig march, butdid not intervene. Christoph Wonneberger, pastor for the LukasLutheran church in Leipzig, said he was surprised by the restraint.   He told West Germany's ZDF television network that somedemonstrators even ``began conversations with paramilitary troops''when the crowd was dispersing.   West German radio also reported peaceful demonstrations Mondayin Dresden, Plauen and Halle.   There is no indication, however, that the government intends tosoften its tough stand against the reforms sweeping such East blocallies as Hungary, Poland and the Soviet Union.   But Monday's demonstrations were far different from the weekendmarches across the country of 16.6 million people, when policemarched into crowds of demonstrators and hit, chased and arrestedhundreds.   Protesters paraded through Leipzig on Monday shouting, ``We NeedFreedom,'' ``Democracy,'' and ``No Violence,'' witnesses said oncondition of anonymity.   The march was the largest single protest in East Germany since a1953 workers uprising was put down by Soviet tanks.   Earlier Monday, Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany denouncedthe East German government as ``rigidly authoritarian'' and saidrelations with East Berlin ``cannot prosper'' under presentconditions.   Also, 18 Lutheran leaders issued an appeal in East Berlincalling on the government to implement democratic reforms andurging all sides to refrain from violence.   At least 50,000 East Germans have fled West in recent months,either over Hungary's newly-open border to Austria or after seekingrefuge in Bonn's embassies in Prague, Czechoslovakia, and Warsaw,Poland.   The exodus deeply embarrassed the government on its two-day 40thanniversary festivities, which were attended by Soviet PresidentMikhail S. Gorbachev.   Gorbachev hinted that he favors for East Germany the types ofreforms he is overseeing in the Soviet Union.</TEXT></DOC>
