ROTHBERG</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The five contenders to replace retiring Paul G.Kirk Jr. as Democratic Party chairman take to the road this weekendfor a series of regional meetings aimed at selecting a leader whocan staunch the flow of voters from its ranks.   The front-runners for the chairmanship are Richard Wiener ofMichigan, president of the Association of State Party Chairs, andRonald H. Brown, a Washington attorney who was a top adviser toJesse Jackson in the late stages of his campaign for the Democraticpresidential nomination.   Also competing for support were three former congressmen _ JimJones of Oklahoma, Michael Barnes of Maryland and James V. Stantonof Ohio.   Ever since Kirk announced early last month that he would not runfor a second four-year term despite the pleas of many party leaders,the contenders to succeed him have competed for the endorsements ofbig-name Democrats.   Brown quickly lined up Sens. Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusettsand Bill Bradley of New Jersey and Gov. Mario Cuomo of New York.   Stanton was backed by former House Speaker Thomas P. O'Neill Jr.of Massachusetts and by House Ways and Means Committee chairman DanRostenkowski of Illinois.   Jones got the support of Sens. Sam Nunn of Georgia and JohnBreaux of Louisiana, while Barnes was backed by former presidentialnominee Walter F. Mondale and former Secretary of State Edmund S.Muskie.   But few if any of the big names making endorsements will castvotes on Feb. 10 when the Democratic National Committee meets inWashington to elect the new party chairman.   That is where Wiener has his strength. Many of the state partyleaders who worked with the Michigan party chairman quickly lined upbehind him after Kirk decided four years was enough.   Many Democrats who tried to convince Kirk to serve a second termargued that a fight for the chairmanship after another losingpresidential campaign _ the fifth in six elections for the WhiteHouse _ would further damage the party's standing among voters.   Some Democrats privately questioned whether the selection ofBrown, who is black and identified with Jackson, would alienateSouthern and blue-collar voters who have deserted the Democrats inrecent presidential elections.   Brown has responded that many of the same Democrats who werecondemning his tie to Jackson were cheering last spring when heagreed to serve as the candidate's convention manager.   Jones said the question was philosophy rather than race, sayingthat Brown was too identified with the party's liberal wing at atime when a centrist was needed as the Democratic spokesman.   ``What Ron Brown is saying is that he should not be judged byJesse Jackson but by the fact that he was campaign manager for TedKennedy against Jim Carter,'' said the former Oklahoma congressman,``and I think that's sort of legitimate and I think that's what thedecision is going to be made from.''   The contenders will meet Saturday in Chicago with Midwest membersof the DNC and then travel to Atlanta for a meeting on Sunday withSoutherners.   Another session is scheduled for Tuesday in Newark, N.J., and afinal one the following Saturday in Salt Lake City.   All five candidates appeared Thursday before union politicaldirectors at the AFL-CIO headquarters.   Of the 404 votes on the DNC, 46 are cast by unionrepresentatives. But labor's influence is considered far greaterthan that, and all the candidates will be watching closely next weekwhen individual union presidents meet with AFL-CIO President LaneKirkland to determine whether labor will issue an endorsement.</TEXT></DOC>
