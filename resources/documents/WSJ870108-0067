Such companies must register with the SEC.    A. Clarence Sampson, the SEC's chief accountant, wouldn't disclose whether the SEC staff will recommend that the agency require such reviews. But SEC officials have indicated that the staff favors mandatory peer reviews.    Under peer review, outside parties check whether an accounting firm's work follows certain standards, and whether it has high quality-control standards.    While accounting firms have been undergoing voluntary peer review since 1977, a number of firms have dropped out of the voluntary program, partly because of the expense. And some firms resented pressure from the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants to undergo peer review every three years.    Some 1,671 accounting firms are members of the institute's self-regulatory program for auditors of SEC registrants. The SEC estimates that an additional 800 accounting firms who audit SEC registrants haven't joined the institute's self-regulatory program. In mid-1981 membership in the institute's self-regulatory arm was a record 2,205.    Meanwhile, the National Conference of CPA Practitioners, a rival organization to the institute, has begun to organize its own peer review program to compete with the institute's program. The conference has 1,250 accounting firm members with total personnel of 10,000. The institute has 240,000 members.    The conference has opposed efforts of the institute to make institute membership for firm partners dependent on membership in the institute's self-regulatory program. Institute members will vote on such a requirement later this month.    Eli Mason, former conference chairman, says adoption of its peer review program could attract members away from the larger institute. Accountants from some smaller firms believe the institute is dominated by the Big Eight accounting firms.    The institute isn't happy that a rival self-regulatory program is being considered by the conference. &quot;Before any organization sets up a parallel (peer review) program, it ought to explore in great depth why it isn't joining ours,&quot; says Thomas Kelley, an institute vice president.    He adds that peer reviews cost from $500,000 to $1 million for the biggest accounting firms and could cost as much as $4,000 for a small accounting firm with 10 CPA employees. </TEXT></DOC>
