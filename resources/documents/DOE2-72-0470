They report on the behaviour of wind energy plantsin short-time-operation studied by spectrum analysis of power outputand on the fuel consumption of diesel units at load changes in short-timeoperation and at thermal compensation processes in intermittent operation.Major results of a statistical study for the Kythnos wind park designare outlined.</TEXT></DOC>
