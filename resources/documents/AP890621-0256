(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A wildcat strike inflamed by twoshootings spread to more than 35,000 miners in Appalachia and theMidwest by today after thousands of miners in Illinois, Kentucky andOhio joined the work stoppage.   At least 40 Illinois mines reported a total of more than 8,000miners who failed to show up for work, and hundreds more joined thewalkout in Ohio and western Kentucky. But employees at four smallKentucky mines returned to work at midnight Tuesday after therelease of three jailed union leaders.   Meantime, CSX Transportation Inc. reported that the railroad'scoal loadings were down about 1,000 cars per day because of thestrike, putting 300 workers at least temporarily off the job.   ``If the strike continues and spreads, the jobs of as many as2,500 employees could be affected,'' said John W. Snow, presidentand chief executive officer of CSX Transportation, headquartered inJacksonville, Fla.   CSX spokeswoman Suzanne Walston estimated the miners' strike hasreduced by by 15 percent the number of cars loaded daily by thecompany.   Some union and industry officials had predicted an end to thewalkouts with the release of the union leaders jailed in Virginiafor their actions in a strike against the Lebanon, Va.,-basedPittston Coal Group Inc.   The three were released Monday night. On Tuesday, they promised afederal judge they would abide by his order banning sit-downdemonstrations to block coal trucks at Pittston plants.   But today, more than 200 cars and pickups drove up and down theroads in front of the entrances to the plants, continuing a convoytactic that resulting in the ticketing of 22 people Tuesday forimpeding traffic.   Nearly 1,700 United Mine Workers members walked off theirPittston jobs in Virginia and West Virginia on April 5 after workingmore than 14 months without a contract. The strike spread toPittston's Kentucky operations Monday, idling 200 more UMW members.   Pittston had dropped out of the Bituminous Coal OperatorsAssociation to negotiate independently.   The unauthorized walkouts began June 12 after a UMW rally inCharleston to protest Pittston's action and to protest the fines andjail terms assessed union members in Virginia.   Shootings were reported Tuesday in Alabama and West Virginia.   In Sumiton, Ala., Assistant Police Chief Steve Jacks said a coaltruck was hit by five bullets. He said the driver, whom he refusedto identify, was not struck by any of the .22-caliber rounds, butdid complain of grittiness in his eyes, possibly caused from thebroken windshield. The truck belongs to Black and Gold Trucking, anindependent Sumiton company.   Jacks said the shooting was strike-related and police wereinvestigating, but no arrests had been made.   ``At this time, we are working closely with some union people totry to get some tempers down,'' Jacks said. ``I think we are makingsome gain and can come to a neutral standoff.''   In West Virginia, where almost two-thirds of the wildcat strikersare located, strike-related gunshots were reported in Mingo County,but no arrests were made and no one was reported injured.   Wildcat strikers also headed to southwest Virginia coal fields totry to slow Pittston coal shipments.   ``They've just got the place saturated with people; it's prettywell blocked up,'' said Virginia state police Lt. C.F. Eaton.   One of the freed union leaders, Marty Hudson, field commander,said he's optimistic miners can beat Pittston. Hudson said thewildcat strikers fear a Pittston victory could set a precedent.   ``They see what Pittston is doing as a threat to their unions,''Hudson said. ``If Pittston is successful, it will directly affecttheir lives.   A union official in Illinois said the release of the unionleaders may help take the steam out of the strike in his state.   ``That's real helpful to me,'' said Kerry Emmons, the presidentof UMW Local 1791, which represents 655 wildcat strikers. ``That isa step in the right direction in getting my people to work.''   Wildcat strikes also were being conducted in Pennsylvania,Indiana, Missouri and Tennessee.</TEXT></DOC>
