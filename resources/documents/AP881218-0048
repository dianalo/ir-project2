About 170 groups participated in the demonstration, including theenvironmentalist Greens Party and the West German Federation forEnvironmental Citizens' Initiatives.   Earlier in the day, police dragged 24 demonstrators out of theplant's ``information center,'' which they had occupied overnight.The two dozen protesters all were released but face possible chargesof disturbing the peace.   During Sunday's demonstration, speakers repeated assertions thata serious nuclear accident nearly developed at the Biblis plant, 30miles south of Frankfurt, one year ago.   Pressure for closing the Biblis plant erupted earlier this monthafter a U.S. technical newsletter disclosed that on Dec. 16-17,1987, operators there allowed a malfunctioning cooling system valveto go uncorrected for 15 hours. A small amount of radioactive steamescaped into the atmosphere during the incident.   The company that runs the plant, Rheinisch-WestfaelischesElektrizitaetwerk, denies trying to conceal information about theincident, and said it caused no damage to the public.   Environmentalists charge that the accident could have led to anuclear core meltdown, but West German atomic officials say theplant is outfitted with emergency systems that would have preventedsuch an occurrence.</TEXT></DOC>
