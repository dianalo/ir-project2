The Frank Russell Co. index covering the first nine months of 1986 shows that values fell 0.7%. Consequently, Russell says, &quot;We believe it is safe to say that calendar year 1986 will report a full year of capital loss.&quot;    Despite the fact that rental income will boost 1986 total return on commercial property to about 6.5%, the slippage in value is unsettling for advisers who have used the index to sell pension funds on real estate investing. &quot;It shocks me,&quot; says Robert Gidel, president of Alex. Brown Realty Advisors Inc.    Perhaps more worrisome, 1987 doesn't promise to be any better for appreciation in property values. In a Salomon Brothers research report, Anthony Downs, senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, sees nothing to be optimistic about, especially for the office market. &quot;I believe 10% vacancy will become the new standard for the 'normal' balance of supply and demand in office space markets -- replacing the traditional standard of 5%,&quot; he says, adding, &quot;There is still a big economic price to be paid for current overbuilding, and someone is going to have to pay for it before office markets become truly profitable again.&quot;    As a result, James Richmond, president of Aetna Realty Investors Inc., expects few pension funds to start new real estate portfolios this year. Ralph Heath, president of National Property Advisors Inc. of Montpelier, Vt., notes, however, that &quot;some sophisticated clients -- the lone rangers -- are reducing their stock portfolios and moving into real estate.&quot;    If there's a silver lining to this, it's that advisers who have outperformed the index can crow. Says Alex. Brown's Mr. Gidel, whose investment performance for an Oregon state pension fund will be evaluated soon: &quot;I'll be 300 basis points above the index.&quot;    ---   THE INVESTMENT TAX CREDIT for rehabilitation of historic buildings has saved many landmarks. So why isn't Forest City Enterprises Inc. making use of it in its $179 million renovation of Cleveland's Terminal Tower?    Albert Ratner, president of Forest City, explains: &quot;When we figured the cost of what (preservationists) wanted, we found that the costs were substantially more than the tax credits were worth.&quot; While Forest City isn't altering the beaux-arts facade of the 57-year-old complex of office, hotel and retail space -- all resting over a railroad station -- the developer is replacing three parallel retail concourses with one. The old store spaces, Mr. Ratner says, are too small; moreover, retailers want a single central court.    Local preservationists such as Eric Johannesen say that the 300,000-square-foot retail space &quot;will look like every other galleria from Houston to Philadelphia.&quot; Adds Carol Pohmiller, another preservationist, &quot;They're wiping out most of the remnants of what was Cleveland's Union Station.&quot; Responds Mr. Ratner: &quot;We're keeping its integrity, and we're spending a bloody fortune to do it.&quot;    ---   HOW LOW CAN IT GO? That's the question that owners of rental apartments in Houston must be asking. In October, a 272-unit apartment complex, partially occupied and needing repairs, was sold at a Department of Housing and Urban Development auction for $665 a unit. Still, Patrick O'Connor, a Houston broker who publishes the newsletter Houston Apartment Trends, says buyers and sellers aren't seeing eye-to-eye on prices. At another auction, the owner rejected the high bid of $6,279 an apartment that some observers considered generous.    ---   HARTFORD, CONN., seemed an unlikely place for high-rise apartment living -- especially in units priced up to $1 million, near downtown and on the &quot;wrong&quot; side of the Connecticut River. Then Phoenix Mutual Insurance Co. and Equity Realty Inc., a marketing consultant, came along with Riverpoint, a 103-unit project priced from $129,000 to $1 million. Within four days last fall, buyers and back-up buyers had spoken for all the units, even though the opening is a year off.    ---   NO ST. LOUIS HOUSING BLUES: For the fifth straight year, St. Louis was the nation's most affordable housing market in 1986, according to U.S. Housing Markets, an industry newsletter. The average conventional mortgage payment in the city was 18% of average household income. Least affordable? Where else -- New York City, where the average mortgage payment was 37.5% of average household income. The national average was 28.4%.    ---   HELPERS OF HOMELESS HALTED: More than a year ago, New York real estate interests, led by developers Jerry Speyer and Leonard Stern, organized a nonprofit effort to build transitional housing for homeless families. Pivotal to the project's success was the use of low-cost modular housing. However, local construction unions balked. Under a compromise, union workers will install plumbing and electrical components on site when work begins in March. One sponsor fumes about the delay, &quot;Families should have been living there last year.&quot;    ---   THE CLOSING: The American Institute of Architects' firm-of-the-year award goes to Benjamin Thompson andamp; Associates, Boston. . . . Auctions have been used to sell homes, but on March 5, Kaufman Lasman Associates, Chicago, will try auctioning leases for 150,000 square feet of office space in Denver. </TEXT></DOC>
