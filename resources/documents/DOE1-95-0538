Examination bytransmission electron microscopy revealed that crystalline regions upto 15 nm diameter were produced throughout the amorphous matrix whenthe ion flux was greater than 2.0 x 10/sup 18/ ions/m/sup 2/-sec in whichthe sample temperature was 850 +- C due to beam heating. Heating unirradiatedsamples to this temperature did not cause crystallization. The crystallineprecipitates were identified as silicon using electron diffraction. TheSi precipitates are thought to be initially present in unirradiated SiOand grow to an observable size during bombardment. The crystallizationprocess followed nucleation and growth kinetics, and was found to saturateafter .8% of the SiO had transformed to crystalline Si at a dose of 1.5x 10/sup 22/ ions/m/sup 2/.</TEXT></DOC>
