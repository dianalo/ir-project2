Both dramas, played out in ornate committee rooms beforenational television audiences, involved the lawmakers in bitterfeuding among themselves and with the White House.   A host of other issues produced a lengthy list ofaccomplishments over a two-year session that brought to a close thefirst 200 years of congressional history.   For the first time since 1976, the House and Senate, workingfuriously, passed all 13 appropriations bills before the start offiscal 1989 _ an event accomplished at three minutes to midnight onSept. 30, the end of fiscal 1988.   ``I think it's been one of the truly great Congresses in myexperience and in this century,'' said House Majority Leader TomFoley, D-Wash. ``It's turned out to be not only a historicCongress, but also an extraordinarily productive one.''   Other major legislative accomplishments included:   _A multibillion dollar attack in the ``war against drugs'' thatfeatures money for rehabilitation, up to $10,000 in civil penaltiesand loss of federal benefits for personal use of even small amountsof drugs, and a death penalty for drug dealers who murder duringdrug-related crimes.   _A complex tax package whose main purpose was correcting errorsin the 1986 tax overhaul, but also included dozens of tax benefitsto one group or another as well as the tax increases to pay forthem. It has a three-year price tag of $4.1 billion.   _The first complete overhaul of the federal welfare system sinceits inception during the depression of the 1930s.   _Ratification of the first U.S.-Soviet arms reduction treaty.The Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces, or INF, treaty requireselimination within three years of all missiles with a range of 300miles to 3,400 miles.   _A sweeping revision of the trade laws, to reduce the tradesurpluses that other countries run with the United States.   _The $18 billion Clean Water Act, passed after two vetoes byPresident Reagan and designed to improve the quality of many ofAmerica's waterways.   _Catastrophic health insurance for millions of elderly ordisabled people who receive Medicare, providing free hospital carefor lengthy illnesses after the recipient pays the first $564.   _Two civil rights bills, the Civil Rights Restoration Act andthe Fair Housing Act.   _An $800 million health package designed to fight the AIDSepidemic, including money for testing, research and home care.   _A $1.2 billion bill providing individual payments of $20,000 toJapanese-American survivors of World War II internment campsestablished in Western states after the Japanese attack on PearlHarbor.   _Drought relief for crop and livestock producers hit by thesummer drought, with a price tag estimated from $3.9 billion to$5.1 billion.   _A package of veterans legislation, including a bill to elevatethe Veterans Administration to Cabinet status, an action that willgive the new Department Veterans Affairs additional political clout.   _An $88 billion highway and mass transit bill that permittedstates to boost the speed limit on some interstate highways to 65miles per hour.   _Legislation prohibiting smoking on domestic airline flights oftwo hours or less, a period that covers the vast majority ofcommercial flights.   Both Senate Majority Leader Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., and HouseSpeaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, called the 100th Congress the mostproductive in two decades.   ``I believe it is the most productive one since LBJ, 20 yearsago,'' Byrd said, referring to the leadership of Lyndon BainesJohnson and passage of the 1965 Civil Rights Act.   ``Perhaps the most productive since 1965-1966,'' Wright echoed.   Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole of Kansas was perhaps thinkingof the session's occasionally raucous, partisan, fighting momentsas well as its accomplishments, when he said he could sumeverything up with two words: ``historic and hysteric.''   Wright, who assumed the speaker's chair at the start of theCongress, replacing Thomas P. ``Tip'' O'Neill, ended the sessionthe subject of an ethics investigation into whether he abused hisoffice for personal financial gain. A separate ethic probe wasunder way into whether he violated House rules by disclosing apurported CIA covert operation in Nicaragua.   Congress' prompt action on money matters, partly as a result ofthe October 1987 stock market crash, meant the government startedfiscal 1989 this month without the usual threats of agovernment-wide shutdown. President Reagan was relieved not to getanother catchall spending bill, wrapping together money forhundreds of government programs.   Following the market crash, White House officials andcongressional leaders held a series of closed-door meetings for amonth, seeking to end a year of clashes over spending and taxlevels. Their budget summit of last November produced an agreement_ since adhered to _ that limited tax increases and set caps onspending levels for domestic, military and foreign assistanceprograms for the last two federal fiscal years.   One of the Congress' earliest acts was to undertake a massiveinvestigation of the Iran-Contra affair. For 14 weeks during thespring and summer of 1987 virtually all other business was shuntedinto the background while House and Senate committees heldunprecedented joint hearings.   Television carried the proceedings to the nation as Lt. Col.Oliver North and his former colleagues wove a tale of a clandestineenterprise extending to four continents. Parallels to Watergatewere drawn and suspense built over whether evidence ultimatelywould link the entire affair directly to Reagan.   The committees reviewed more than 300,000 documents andinterviewed more than 500 witnesses as they probed the sale ofweapons to Iran and the diversion of some of the ``profits'' to aidthe Contra rebels fighting Nicaragua's leftist government.   Secretary of State George Shultz, who had opposed thearms-for-hostages swap, summed it up for investigators: ``Our guysgot taken to the cleaners.''   But in the end, there was no ``smoking gun.'' In a report issuedat the end of 1987, the committees concluded that a ``cabal of ...zealots'' had lied, deceived Congress and each other and exhibiteddisdain for the law. ``The ultimate responsibility for the eventsin the Iran-Contra affair must rest with the president,'' theyconcluded.   Of 110 judicial court nominees submitted by Reagan to theSenate, 91 were confirmed. As a result, in nearly eight years inoffice, Reagan has named just more than half of the active judgeson U.S. district and appellate courts and the Supreme Court.   By far the most contentious nomination fight was over Reagan'snomination of Bork to succeed Lewis F. Powell. The conservativenominee had written much that was controversial, and he refused toback down from his criticism of what he saw as the Supreme Court'sunconstitutional activism.   It was a fight basically fought out on television, from the livebroadcasts of the confirmation hearings and Senate sessions, to thetaped commercials from both sides.   Even though clearly defeated, Bork declined to withdraw,insisting on a vote. When it came, he was rejected 58-42. Reagan'ssecond attempt to replace Powell was torpedoed when Douglas H.Ginsburg withdrew as a nominee after conflict of interest questionsarose he after he admitted smoking marijuana while a Harvard LawSchool professor.   Reagan's third choice, Anthony M. Kennedy, was confirmed 97-0last Feb. 3.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
