Allen's Jan. 8 editorial-page article was capturedin the headline: &quot;Let's Have Real Competition in PhoneMarket.&quot; However, he defines competition as deregulation ofthe long-distance business, free entry for ATandamp;T into allmarkets and continued restriction of potential competitorsfrom many of those markets. This is competition?   Real competition should mean the consumer has the abilityto choose from a wide range of telecommunications-serviceproviders and that consumer standards and demands will driveproduct quality and price.</LP><TEXT>   Much of the rhetoric that has surfaced to mark the 10thanniversary of divestiture -- including Mr. Allen's statement-- attempts to rewrite history by telling only half thestory. For example, it's true that long-distance rates arelower today than they were before divestiture. They are lowerbecause long-distance no longer has to subsidize localservice. The subsidizing amount has simply shifted away fromlong-distance and become part of local service. In fact, FCCdata show that real local-service increases, nationwide,average only one-half percent a year since divestiture.   Importantly, local-service competition has now beenauthorized in most states. Today, ATandamp;T or any other company,if it chooses, can enter the local telephone-service businessand provide local service to as many or as few customers asit chooses. The Bell companies, on the other hand, mayprovide service only within court-defined calling areas.   ATandamp;T may manufacture. The Bell companies may not. Is it&quot;real competition&quot; to permit ATandamp;T to enter any line ofbusiness while prohibiting the Bell companies from beingATandamp;T's competitors in certain businesses?   Barring the regional Bell companies from manufacturing notonly has denied consumer choice, but also has weakened theU.S. economy by limiting the economic contribution thetelecommunications industry could make. Here are the facts:   -- While the Bell companies have been barred frommanufacturing, the U.S. has continued to exporttelecommunications jobs. A DRI/McGraw-Hill study revealedthat the ban on manufacturing by the year 2000 will suppresscreation of as many as 14,000 to 32,000 jobs in New Jerseyalone.   -- Without question, work that once was done in the U.S.is done offshore today. ATandamp;T now imports 100% of theconsumer-telephone equipment and 80% of the parts of thenetwork-switching equipment it sells.   -- Since 1983, ATandamp;T has closed or reduced the work forceat 30 U.S. manufacturing plants and eliminated 60,000 U.S.jobs, while investing in overseas manufacturing in 16 othercountries and creating 20,000 new jobs in those countries.Exporting manufacturing jobs may have made ATandamp;T morecompetitive, but the U.S. worker and consumer have paid theprice.   It's time the consumer harvested the benefits ofdivestiture by having real choice in selecting providers ofall telecommunications service. This is why Ameritech haschampioned full competition in all parts of thetelecommunications industry, including local telephoneservice. Consumers will benefit from competition only whenanyone may provide any aspect of telecommunications service.This is why Ameritech developed a plan, now authorized by theFederal Communications Commission, to sell discrete portionsof our network services to anyone who wants to buy them inorder to package them for resale. This is why we opened ournetwork to alternative service providers.   It's time the policy makers remembered that creating realcompetition is what divestiture was really all about. Itwasn't about creating a veiled monopoly or duopoly inmanufacturing. It wasn't about denying consumers the power ofchoosing to buy from among all interestedtelecommunications-service providers.   Let consumers decide where they want to buy, from whomthey will buy and which competitors will thrive. That's whatdivestiture was intended to accomplish. That's what consumerinterest demands. Ten years after divestiture, we shouldn'tsettle for less.   William L. Weiss   Chairman and CEO   Ameritech   Chicago</TEXT></DOC>
