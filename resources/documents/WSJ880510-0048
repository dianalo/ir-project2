LOUIS -- Paul Miller stands at the corner of Sarah Street and Garfield Avenue, malt-liquor caps and fast-food debris underfoot, surveying the community crumbling around him. &quot;I know we can bring businesses back,&quot; he says wistfully, &quot;because we've had them here before.&quot;    Mr. Miller, a 45-year-old black M.B.A., grew up here, and he remembers when two tiny food stores competed for customers on the corner and a barbershop thrived next door. Farther along were a dry cleaner and a candy store, a lawyer and a doctor, a gas station and a car-repair shop. In his basement, his father ran a beauty-supply distributorship. &quot;Everywhere you can see there was economic activity,&quot; he says.    Then came integration. Black businesses that had prospered for decades because they had captive consumers suddenly had to compete with white-owned companies with far more resources. &quot;When blacks can go downtown to shop,&quot; says economist Andrew Brimmer, &quot;they're going to get out of the neighborhood and do so.&quot;    Today, up and down Sarah Street, plywood covers windows that used to display merchandise or menus. Building after building is charred from fires. A scrawl of graffiti on one, across from Mr. Miller's old home, describes what happened to neighborhood commerce: &quot;The Execution,&quot; it says.    Black Americans disagree about who should try to raise the corpse. Most of the growing black middle class -- which may be proportionally as large as the white middle class by early in the next century -- isn't eager to return to thriftless areas long left behind. But Mr. Miller is convinced that if merchants could be brought back, a lot of the other problems would correct themselves. &quot;Entrepreneurship is the solution,&quot; he insists, &quot;because to participate in the American system, you've got to own something.&quot;    By and large, blacks own little now. Educational opportunities have created a growing cadre of savvy black investors who look beyond traditional black businesses such as car dealerships and construction companies. Yet the majority of black business is languishing.    The last comprehensive survey of minority-owned companies, conducted by the Census Bureau in 1982, showed that while blacks account for about 12% of the U.S. population, they own only 2% of American businesses. And those businesses are mostly small. Only 11% of black firms have paid employees, and average sales in 1982 were a mere $36,000.    Some historians link the poor state of black business to African cultures in which private property isn't highly valued. Others call attention to the many years blacks were subjugated in the U.S. -- slavery around St. Louis began in 1723.    The problem with these analyses is that black business is actually getting weaker. &quot;Things have just fallen apart,&quot; says Roscoe Ellis, the head of a development project for the National Business League, which has given technical assistance to black companies since Booker T. Washington founded it at the turn of the century. &quot;Black business needs to remember what it used to be like.&quot;    In a city like St. Louis, where 46% of the 453,000 residents are black, harking back isn't always so simple. Myron Gray would like to start a pastry company on the north side. &quot;The area needs something,&quot; he says. The problem is, it needs it too badly. &quot;The area is so blighted, no one wants to lend me anything,&quot; Mr. Gray says.    And much has changed in the economy as a whole. The rise of suburban shopping malls, chain stores and franchised restaurants has sapped the mom-and-pop operations once found throughout the ghetto. At the same time, white-controlled companies -- recognizing that blacks spend some $200 billion a year -- are directing more marketing attention to the community.    Ethnic hair-care products were practically a black monopoly until several years ago, but now Revlon Inc. and others have cut into the market. Other black businesses have been sold; at least three on Black Enterprise magazine's 1986 list of the 100 largest black businesses now have majority white ownership. Smaller black businesses in the inner city also face ever-growing competition from immigrant groups, especially Asians.    Many blacks don't seem to care much whether they buy from black-owned firms or not. In the more insular Asian and Hispanic communities, a dollar turns over four or five times before leaving, but studies suggest that most dollars earned by blacks aren't passed on to other blacks even once. Mr. Brimmer's research shows that in 1969, the receipts of black businesses equaled 13.5% of blacks' after-tax income. By 1977, that figure had shrunk to 9.9%, and by 1985 to 6.6%.    Three years ago Leo Hardin opened an 85-seat seafood restaurant and fish market on St. Louis's north side &quot;to put something decent there.&quot; He had to close it a couple of months ago, largely, he says, because &quot;black folk are not supportive of their own businesses.&quot;    Marketing studies have shown that blacks, more than other groups, associate big-name brands with high quality. &quot;At some point, it goes beyond economics and into social perceptions,&quot; says Gavin Chen, the staff economist at the federal Minority Business Development Agency.    &quot;Buy Black&quot; campaigns to counter the trend date from the 1940s. Among those promoting the cause today are television host Tony Brown and Louis Farrakhan's group the Nation of Islam. It's one piece of a larger movement to encourage blacks to help other blacks rather than rely on government aid.    But it isn't easy. In St. Louis, Melvin Jones left his law practice four years ago to start the Black Pages, a phone directory he hopes will encourage blacks to patronize black-owned firms. &quot;We're trying to put out a publication for businesses that are in the worst shape,&quot; he says. &quot;It's like pulling teeth.&quot;    Structural changes in the U.S. economy have hurt blacks. The demise of inner-city factories and the growth of the service sector have left poorly educated urban dwellers -- 60% of blacks live in inner cities -- bereft of employment opportunities. Nearly 90,000 jobs in central St. Louis that didn't require a high-school diploma vanished from 1970 to 1984, University of Chicago sociologist William Julius Wilson calculates; the number requiring some higher education held about even.    &quot;Most of the factory jobs are gone,&quot; notes Lesren Hines, 35, who worked at a General Motors plant here until, like many of the former shoe and garment factories, it closed. &quot;It's a shame. Those are the kind of jobs you can improve yourself on,&quot; he says. Now Mr. Hines must support his family on less than $175 a week he earns as a building maintenance man.    James Allen, 45, is in worse shape, with no job at all. He says he survives mainly on $87 a month in food stamps, &quot;just enough for two bags of neck bones, a bag of hamburger and a little flour.&quot; Glancing around his north-side neighborhood, he says, &quot;There's nothing on these empty lots but promises that no one keeps.&quot;    Bill Mallory used to direct black companies to the north side 15 years ago, as a consultant for the St. Louis Minority Business Development Center. Now many couldn't survive there, especially retailers. &quot;A lot of people come in here with pipe dreams to help the community,&quot; Mr. Mallory says. &quot;Most of the time we have to tell them that the area is just not ready for that.&quot;    Getting start-up money continues to be a major hurdle, despite help from private groups like Mr. Mallory's and programs dating from the Nixon administration's push for &quot;black capitalism.&quot; There are only 36 black-controlled banks out of more than 14,000 commercial institutions across the country, which includes stockholder-owned banks. And recent research from the Universities of Maryland and Vermont and two private firms indicates that some white-controlled banks still discriminate in lending.    But racial bias isn't the only obstacle to getting seed money. &quot;We want to improve the area,&quot; says C.W. Gates, the chairman of St. Louis's Gateway Bank, a black bank with assets of about $21 million. &quot;But there's no reason to help start a business in a deprived neighborhood where a struggling entrepreneur will lose his shirt.&quot;    This is the Catch-22 confounding the black community, and the black middle class most of all. How to help -- or, more precisely, who should help -- is a nettlesome question.    Take David Price Jr., a vice president of the Monsanto Chemical unit of Monsanto Co. Like many educated blacks of his generation, the 42-year-old Mr. Price chose the stability of a corporate career after he graduated from Harvard with an M.B.A. But often, he says, blacks make him feel as if he has abandoned the old neighborhood. &quot;It's unfair,&quot; he says. &quot;Nobody is asking my white classmates from Harvard to put anything back anywhere.&quot;    As Mr. Price sees it, &quot;For me to take what I know -- 18 years of business acumen -- and to put that into the neighborhood in the form of a mom-and-pop store or a franchise would not at all be productive. I think I can make more of an impact by being a role model.&quot;    Harold Antoine, who administers several poverty programs in St. Louis, tends to agree. &quot;You don't become a businessman so you can make social gestures,&quot; he says as he cruises down Martin Luther King Boulevard, once the busiest black shopping district in St. Louis and now a five-mile stretch of boarded-up storefronts. &quot;Blacks can't be expected to help here more than whites are expected to help in Appalachia,&quot; he says. He calls for government intervention.    Even when blacks want to help, it's sometimes hard. Ronald Thompson, the chairman of General Railroad Equipment andamp; Services Inc., a St. Louis firm, says he tries to provide blacks with jobs whenever he can. Since buying the company seven years ago, he has increased jobs for blacks at his 100-employee East St. Louis, Ill., specialty freight-car plant to about 50% from less than 10%.    But at another operation in rural northern Illinois, there are hardly any minorities to draw from. &quot;We picked that location because we needed the river access there to be successful,&quot; Mr. Thompson says. &quot;I know I have a social responsibility. But I also have a responsibility to my shareholders.&quot;    Back on Sarah Street, Paul Miller is looking for answers. Although he sold his family's hair-care-products business a few years ago, he has property in north St. Louis and is looking for ways to develop it.    Along with Mr. Thompson, he is helping to fund a program for inner-city youth interested in becoming entrepreneurs. His new company, a beverage marketing concern, is not far from where he grew up. &quot;I'm disappointed that more blacks have not come back here,&quot; he says. &quot;I have not abandoned the city.&quot;    But there is a rub, too: &quot;Coming back means taking a big risk,&quot; he acknowledges. &quot;And who's to say what somebody else's responsibility is?&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
