Robertson's comments came at an Atlanta news conference duringwhich he complained that U.S. intelligence in the Middle East isinadequate and declared that action must be quick when Americansare taken hostage.   A Robertson aide said later that the former televisionevangelist was referring to passengers who had been taken hostageby hijackers of a TWA flight in the Middle East.   ``We identified in our news department at CBN the location ofthose hostages in Lebanon very shortly after they were taken, andthey were in a position where they could have been rescued,''Robertson said.   ``They were in Beirut, and they could have been freed.''   Robertson did not provide specifics and did not say whichhostages were involved.   Reagan, at a nationally broadcast news conference, responded toRobertson's claim.   ``It'd be very strange if he actually did have information as tothe location of those hostages,'' said the president. ``Isn't itstrange that no one in our administration was ever apprised ofthat?''   ``If he thought that he knew,'' the president said of Robertson,``he kept it to himself.''   Reagan added that ``we have tried our best and through everykind of channel to establish their (the hostages') whereaboutsbecause that's the beginning of efforts to try and get them free.''   ``It's very frustrating to try and establish a location,''Reagan said. ``But we've never let up, and we never will, in tryingto obtain the freedom of all the hostages.''   After Reagan spoke, Robertson's deputy press secretary, ScottHatch, said: ``I think what Pat said was accurate.''   Benton Miller, spokesman for CBN, based in Virginia Beach, Va.,later issued a synopsis of the news report to which Robertsonreferred. He said it involved hostages who had been taken from TWAFlight 847.   The synopsis said that in response to a question from Robertson,a CBN Middle East correspondent, who was not named, said thehostages, ``are in several locations in and around Lebanon and wehave also learned that maybe at least one of them, and we do notknow which one, but we have been told by intelligence sources inLebanon, that at least one may be being held in Tehran.''   The suspicion concerning the hostage thought to be held inTehran was later reported as incorrect in a subsequent news reporton Robertson's ``700 Club'' talk show, Miller said.   Asked whether he had told the Reagan administration what heknew, the former television evangelist said, ``I broadcast it onnational television; they monitor our programs virtually everyday.''   Later, in an interview on Atlanta radio station WGST, Robertsonsaid the information about the hostages was obtained by aCBN-affiliated TV station in Lebanon. ``My reporters in Lebanon hadinformation, initially, on where these hostages were taken,'' hesaid.   Robertson said that was ``several years ago, when the firsthostages were taken.''   Rival Republican candidate Jack Kemp called Robertson'sstatements irresponsible and said he should ``apologize to thefamilies of the hostages whom he has needlessly hurt in an attemptto gain publicity.''   Vice President George Bush, campaigning in Boston, was askedabout Robertson's statements. ``My question would be, how come hedidn't get hold of the proper authorities in the United Statesgovernment that were working day and night, trying to figure outhow they could get these people out?''   In his news conference, Robertson said action to rescue hostages``has to be quick and it has to be a surprise, that once thesituation has hardened, six months have gone by, eight months, ayear, it's virtually impossible to get any movement because thehostages are dispersed and the captors are more or less dug in.''   Robertson aide Gary Lane told The Associated Press that in 1985,``during the TWA Flight 847 crisis,'' CBN Beirut Bureau Chief GusHashem ``had information from sources where the hostages were beingheld in West Beirut and who was holding them.''   Lane said the State Department contacted CBN for information atthat time, but he said he did not know exactly who made the contact.   A State Department terrorism expert said he was puzzled by thecontention.   The official, who commented only on condition of remaininganonymous, said he was unaware that CBN ever broadcast the preciselocations of any hostages. He also said knowledge of hostages'whereabouts in terms of a particular city or even a section of acity wouldn't be enough to mount a rescue mission.   Nine Americans are in captivity in Lebanon, including Marine Lt.Col. William R. Higgins, who was captured last week. TerryAnderson, chief Middle East correspondent of The Associated Press,is the longest-held captive, having been kidnapped on March 16,1985.   Robertson's comments on the hostages marked the second time intwo weeks that his statements on international matters have sparkedcontroversy. During a Republican presidential debate on Feb. 14, healleged that the Soviets have nuclear missiles in Cuba, pointing tothe United States. The Reagan administration denied it.   In yet another controversy, Bush asked Robertson to apologize orprovide proof to back up his suggestion on Tuesday thatanti-Robertson political motivations were behind the timing ofpublic allegations of sexual misconduct against televisionevangelist Jimmy Swaggart.   ``By sundown in the old South, I'd like to see him stand up likea Southern gentleman with a little evidence,'' Bush said. ``I'dlike to see an apology or proof.''</TEXT></DOC>
