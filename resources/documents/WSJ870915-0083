The prospect has the five U.S. makers of the chemicals and thousands of users in a wide range of industries wondering what to do until substitutes reach the market in five to 10 years.    &quot;The treaty may jeopardize the life of existing equipment and is going to cause us to spend a lot on engineering new products,&quot; says Richard C. Barnett, chairman of the Alliance for Responsible CFC Policy, a group of some 500 makers and customers of chlorofluorocarbons, also known as CFCs. &quot;Beyond that, we aren't sure what the impact will be,&quot; he adds.    U.S. manufacturers sell about $750 million of the compounds annually to about 5,000 customers in the refrigeration, air-conditioning, automotive, plastic-foam and electronics industries, according to the alliance.    Those industries in turn produce each year $27 billion in goods and services directly dependent on chlorofluorocarbons. Moreover, some $135 billion of installed equipment and products require the availability of the compounds for maintenance and repair, according to the alliance.    The treaty, being negotiated under the auspices of the United Nations Environmental Program, would take effect in 1989, when world-wide emissions of the most commonly used chlorofluorocarbons would be capped at 1986 levels. The treaty also is expected to call for phasing in by 1996 a 50% cut in emissions based on 1986 levels, pending the outcome of continuing scientific findings on the ozone-depletion problem.    A dispute at the treaty conference in Montreal continued yesterday over how many countries need to agree to the treaty for it to take effect, but a U.N. official said he hoped a compromise could be reached by tomorrow.    The economic impact of the cap alone could be huge, with prices at least doubling for existing compounds, alliance officials say. They predict that consumers will pay more for such things as automobile air conditioners and that some companies that rely heavily on the chemicals, such as foam-insulator contractors, could be forced out of business.    Chlorofluorocarbons are synthetic compounds of chlorine, fluorine, carbon and sometimes hydrogen that are ideal for use in refrigeration, air-conditioning and insulation systems and as industrial solvents because they don't burn, explode or corrode, and don't irritate or poison people.    The problem occurs when chlorofluorocarbons escape or are released into the atmosphere. Scientists believe the compounds travel to the ozone layer that protects the Earth from ultraviolet rays and decompose, releasing chlorine that attacks the ozone.    If trends in use of the compounds continue, scientists theorize that people would be exposed to increased ultraviolet radiation, which could lead to more skin cancers and other environmental damage.    Developing less-destructive compounds is the ultimate answer, says the alliance. But the group says the available substitutes -- chlorofluorocarbons that wouldn't be covered by the treaty because they don't deplete the ozone as much -- are generally neither as safe for workers and consumers nor as adaptable to a broad range of industrial uses as existing compounds.    One substitute, CFC 22, is already in significant use for certain commercial and residential air-conditioning systems, says the alliance's Mr. Barnett, who is also vice president and general manager of York International Corp., a York, Pa.-based maker of air-conditioning equipment. But CFC 22 has qualities that make it too costly or inappropriate for most other applications.    Industry officials estimate that substitutes now available or under development could be used in 50% to 60% of current applications of CFC 11 and CFC 12, the two compounds most often employed in refrigeration, air-conditioning and insulation products. But bringing most of those substitutes to market will require two to three years of toxicity tests plus time to adapt equipment and develop production capacity. Only two of the five U.S. makers, Du Pont Co. and Allied-Signal Inc., are developing alternatives.    For example, Du Pont, which accounts for 20% to 25% of world chlorofluorocarbon production and is the largest domestic producer, has stepped up development of CFC 134a, a compound that doesn't contain ozone-depleting chlorine, but which researchers hope will perform as well as current compounds in a wide range of applications, though at much higher cost. Allied-Signal is also working on CFC 134a.    Despite the time it will take to bring any product to market, Du Pont says it isn't too worried about business disruptions. &quot;We figure five to seven years will allow for an orderly phase-out (of restricted compounds) and an orderly phase-in of new materials,&quot; a spokesman says. &quot;And that assumes you don't run into any real problems along the way.&quot;    Pennwalt Corp., on the other hand, is moving aggressively to adapt a commercially available product for use as an immediate replacement for CFC 12.    &quot;Of the five domestic CFC producers, we have the only available alternative product for some uses of CFCs,&quot; claims Peter McCarthy, a vice president of the Philadelphia-based company with 8% to 10% of the domestic chlorofluorocarbon market.    Pennwalt says the product, a blend of CFC 142b and CFC 22, was developed as a substitute for a propellant in aerosol cans in 1978, after the U.S. acted unilaterally to control aerosol uses of chlorofluorocarbons. The company says the blend could conceivably replace all CFC 12.    Some industry analysts, however, say Pennwalt will have a big selling job because its product costs twice as much as current compounds and customers might not see the blend as a long-term solution to their problems. Nevertheless, &quot;There will be a market out there when regulation occurs,&quot; asserts Peter M. Miller, manager of Pennwalt's chlorofluorocarbon division.    The case of automobile air conditioners illustrates some of the problems chlorofluorocarbon users have with existing substitutes. &quot;Basically, there is nothing we can dump into our existing air conditioning unit without&quot; developing new compressors, lubricants and hoses, says Gerald F. Stofflet, assistant director of automotive emission control at General Motors Corp.'s environmental activities staff.    Moreover, he says, GM isn't interested in using an interim compound until a better substitute comes along, and &quot;the only other option is to buy higher priced CFC 12 or not offer air conditioning. Anyway you go, the consumer gets hit&quot; because the costs would be passed along, he adds. But Mr. Stofflet says the increase of $15 a unit probably wouldn't be noticed much in air conditioners that cost $600 to $700 each.    Companies are also exploring ways to recover and recycle the chemicals that would be limited by the treaty. Alliance officials say this would be relatively easy to accomplish in the electronics industry. But GM's Mr. Stofflet says it will take almost as long to develop commercially the recovery of chlorofluorocarbons from automobile air conditioners as it will to develop acceptable substitutes.    For other major users, neither substitutes nor recovery hold out much hope in the short term. Some makers of polyurethane foam insulation, for example, won't have an acceptable substitute for five to seven years, says Dennis Ross, a vice president with Celotex Corp., a Tampa, Fla.-based building materials unit of Jim Walter Corp.    Moreover, because chlorofluorocarbons account for anywhere from a quarter to two-fifths of the cost of the finished product, foam companies, unlike auto makers, are very sensitive to price moves. &quot;We feel like the bug flying in the middle of an interstate that knows it's not going to make it to the side of the road without getting squashed,&quot; says L.L. Cockrell, co-owner of RPC Industries Inc., a Hampton, Va., foam-blowing contractor. &quot;If the price of foam doubles or quadruples, a lot of workers will be out on the street, and businesses will have $100,000 of scrap in the backyard,&quot; he adds.    The alliance opposes those parts of the pending treaty calling for emission reductions. It argues that the cap at 1986 levels would be sufficient to head off a depletion problem and spur industry to develop adequate substitutes far less threatening to the ozone layer. The alliance doesn't expect the treaty to reflect its view.    Despite their reservations, alliance officials say the treaty is better than any potential unilateral U.S. action, which, they argue, would harm the U.S.'s competitiveness abroad. Several bills are before Congress that call for the U.S. to phase out use of certain chlorofluorocarbons in short order.    &quot;Those measures are Draconian and could potentially cause more problems for the economy than solve for the environment,&quot; says the alliance's Mr. Barnett.    ---   U.S. Production of Chlorofluorocarbons     Volume by application (1985)    (In percent)   Refrigerants 45%     Blowing Agents               30%   Cleaning Agents 20%     Aerosols                      5%   Sources: Alliance for Responsible CFC Policy; International Trade Commission </TEXT></DOC>
