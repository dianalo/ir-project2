To standardize the Agency's approaches,the EPA drafted guidelines for health risk assessment of chemical mixturesthat describe the nature of the problem, offer a decision framework forrisk assessment, and discuss general procedures for estimating risk.Two types of procedures are described: assessment of the mixture of concern,and estimation of risk, based on toxicological information on the mixture'scomponents. Risk estimation based on mixture data follows proceduresused for single chemicals. For assessments based on component data, theguidelines recommend a dose-additive model for similar acting thresholdtoxicants and a risk-additive model for carcinogens. An extensive effortwas initiated to compile known information on toxic interactions, includingtoxicity data, statistical techniques used to determine interactions,and theories on mechanisms. The project includes a computer databasecontaining over 1200 toxicity studies. Initial data review indicatesthat authors most often use dose addition or response addition to determineexpected response. Whole-body responses dominated the studies, and nearly80% of experimental exposures were less than 90 days.</TEXT></DOC>
