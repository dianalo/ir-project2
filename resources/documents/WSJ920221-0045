The new structure, which was largely put in place lastyear, ends most transactions between New York Telephone andother Nynex subsidiaries. In addition, it gives the New YorkPublic Service Commission greater ability to monitor New YorkTelephone transactions for any abuse.</LP><TEXT>   Both federal and state regulators were alarmed two yearsago when a federal audit turned up $118 million inovercharges paid by Nynex's New York Telephone and NewEngland Telephone units to a now-defunct central purchasingarm. The restructuring plan is designed to prevent thecompany from using ratepayer money to support Nynex'snon-telephone businesses.   The commission suspended a planned investigation of NewYork Telephone. The commission also directed its staff tomake sure the restructuring plan accomplishes its goals ofprotecting consumers.</TEXT></DOC>
