 Natural language products wereintroduced in 1984 with Microrim's Clout.andP;  Recent products likeInformation Builders' EQL and Pansophic Systems' Easytrieve PlusNL have the additional feature of being able to generate the codefor natural language queries.andP;  This feature helps user anddeveloper work interactively to establish content of standardreports as well as providing a prototyping and template tool forthe application developer.andM;</SUMMARY><DESCRIPT>Topic:     Natural Language InterfacesQuery ProcessingUser Interface.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Query Au NaturelandM;Natural language can allow people to use something they already know--theEnglish language--to ask questions about something they don't know--the datain their databases.andP;  After all, natural language and database management arealready closely related.andP;  Since most natural language products take advantageof database other structured query technique.andP;  These qualities--flexibilityand knowledge--combined with the ability to generate a coded version of anatural language query, make these products useful development tools forapplication developers.andM;Incorporating natural language into applications poses one problem that'shindered general purpose natural language query products: How do youcustomize the vocabulary?andP;  To use a general purpose product, you've got topreset the vocabularly.andP;  This requires an understanding of the data structureand the query product, as well as the ability to anticipate the vocabularyyou'll want to use.andP;  This process is better carried out by an expert.andP;  Andthat's why developers are in a perfect position to incorporate naturallanguage into their applications.andM;Some information into their applications.andP;  links, what fields identify whatrows, and standard formulas or phrases--are necessary in developing anapplication.andP;  The developer already has to establish this information tobuild the application.andP;  The next step is to preset it for use with a naturallanguage product.andM;Natural languages have been available for applications since the introductionof Clout from Microrim in 1984.andP;  It let users go beyond the standardinformation available through the application and explore the underlyingdata, without understanding the database structure or the formal querylanguage.andP;  Clout's vocabulary could be customized by the developer to furtheraid the user.andP;  Succeeding product advances brought more adaptable retrievalmodules.andP;  Qandamp;A from Symantec, EQL from Information Builders, and EasytrievePlus NL from Pansophic Systems permit information about the database,vocabulary, and result format to be preset.andM;When users want to explore their data or add reports, natural language letsthem work with the data in a language they already know.andP;  Field/file namesand relationships, synonyms, application specific terms and equations, anddefault result formats are preset by an expert, the developer.andP;  Since auser's reports can be saved in English, instead of program code, they'reresilient to changes in database structure.andM;More recent products, EQL and Easytrieve Plus NL, aid application developmentby generating the code for natural language questions.andP;  This feature benefitsdevelopers in several ways:andM;1.andP;  As a communications tool.andP;  A developer can sit down with a customer andinteractively work out the content of standard reports for a new application.andM;2.andP;  As a prototyping tool.andP;  By using an English version of standard reports,code can be quickly regenerated to reflect revised database structures as theapplication is refined, rather than continually modifying each report.andM;3.andP;  As a template tool.andP;  When the database structure is finalized, thegenerated code is the basis for producing the final, optimized, fullyformatted report.andM;By using the dialog capabilities of a natural language query product,developers and users can work together interactively to establish reportcontent.andP;  The example in Fig.andP;  1 uses Easytrieve Plus NL.andP;  The query &quot;Listsalaries&quot; can be stated a number of ways.andP;  A language parser identifies andclassifies individual words in processing the query.andP;  This allows for aflexible vocabulary and syntax and provides easy-to-learn query products.andO;Users can form their query with the language they're familiar with.andM;Just as the current generation of natural language query products is superiorto the previous, the next will be more powerful.andP;  Developers who realize theutility of current products will be in a better position to use the power inproducts still to come.andM;Timothy Winston, President, and Michael Taylor, VP, left Microrim, Inc. tofound Elliott Bay Computing, Inc. in 1985.andP;  Timothy Winston was an originalmember of the development team at Microrim.andP;  Michael Taylor left BoeingComputer Services in 1983 to codevelop Microrim's natural language productCLOUT.andM;Elliott Bay Computing develops custom data management interfaces forcommercial applications, blending techniques such as: natural language query,intelligent Query By Example, visual report formatting, and formal languagegeneration.andP;
