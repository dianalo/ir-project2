Their statement was written in Arabic and issued in Beirut.   It was addressed to the captors and said: ``We plead with you inthe name of humanity for which Islam is known to release ourcolleague John out of mercy for his dying mother, whose only wishnow is to see him before she passes away.''   The Beirut office of London-based Worldwide Television Newshandled the appeal's distribution. McCarthy, 32, worked for theorganization when he was kidnapped April 17, 1986, on the way to theBeirut airport.   It was the third appeal in 10 days. McCarthy's father, Pat,pleaded for his release June 20, saying the captive's mother,Sheila, was ``gravely ill in hospital.''   ``The doctors have told us she is dying,'' the senior McCarthysaid.   On the next day, Dr. Terrance Wheeler, the physician treatingMrs. McCarthy for cancer in London, said she ``has at best a fewdays to live.''   ``It would be the kindest of humanitarian gestures on the part ofthose holding John McCarthy to release John in the final moments ofhis mother's life,'' Wheeler said.   McCarthy is among 14 foreigners missing in Lebanon and presumedto be hostages, including nine Americans. Held longest is Terry A.Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent of The Associated Press,who was abducted March 16, 1985.</TEXT></DOC>
