The agency at the same time said it had reached a consentagreement with Budget, which agreed to make the inspections andrepairs on a timely basis.   Jody Wilson, a spokeswoman at Budget's corporate headquarters inChicago, said the company had no immediate comment on the FTCannouncement.   According to the government's complaint, Budget rented to thegeneral public automobiles that were subject to recall notices.   The company allegedly did not inspect these vehicles within areasonable period of time after the recall notice to determinewhether they contained safety-related defects and, whereappropriate, repair the vehicles. Budget then failed to disclosethese facts to prospective renters or purchasers of the vehicles,the FTC said.   Under the consent agreement, Budget will inspect and repair thevehicles within 120 days after receiving a recall notice.   Alternatively, if Budget chooses not to inspect, the order wouldrequire Budget to disclose to prospective renters that the vehiclesare subject to safety recall notices and may contain defects.   The proposed consent agreement, scheduled to appear in theFederal Register on Jan. 3, will be subject to public comment for 60days, after which the FTC will decide whether to make it final.   A consent agreement is for settlement purposes only and does notconstitute admission of a law violation.   When the FTC issues a consent order on a final basis, it carriesthe force of law with respect to future actions. Each violation ofsuch an order may result in a civil penalty of up to $10,000.</TEXT></DOC>
