Jefferson (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> DIS TDM CP TBY </CO><IN> STK </IN><TEXT>   Insiders continue to sell shares of Walt Disney Co., but the company and analysts say there is nothing to worry about.    Seven insiders have sold shares over the past six months, and no insiders have bought. The latest sales were by a pair of vice presidents. Erwin D. Okun sold his entire holding of 13,200 shares on Aug. 19, and Arthur Levitt III sold all his 1,200 shares on Aug. 31.    In June, Chairman Michael D. Eisner sold 330,390 shares, a little less than half his holding, and President Frank G. Wells sold all 580,000 of his common shares. However, both of those men and many other Disney executives still hold extensive options to purchase shares at below-market prices.    Mr. Okun said yesterday he sold his shares for tax and personal reasons, and to repay a loan used earlier to acquire Disney shares. Previously, Disney had said Mr. Eisner's sale was solely for tax reasons, while Mr. Wells was selling partly for estate-planning reasons.    Analysts say they aren't troubled by the selling. Mark Manson of Donaldson, Lufkin andamp; Jenrette Securities Corp. likes, among other things, the company's expansion of hotels at Disney World, its acquisition of Childcraft Education Corp., and the planned opening of a Disney resort in Paris in 1992.    Lee Isgur of PaineWebber Inc. says it was only natural for Messrs. Eisner and Wells to cash in some of their paper gains. Since they took the reins at Disney about four years ago, they have &quot;realized tens of millions of dollars,&quot; he says.    David Londoner of Wertheim Schroder andamp; Co. also shrugs off the selling. He considers Disney stock a bargain at about 16 times earnings, and figures it would sell for more except that attendance was down at Disney World and Disneyland this year. He expects it to rebound soon.    Disney closed yesterday at $63.25, about the same price at which the insiders sold.    ---   Fresh Eyes: Like many high-tech companies, Tandem Computers Inc. has seen more insiders sell than buy this year. In May through July, five vice presidents sold portions of their holdings, getting prices above $18 a share.    For the moment, it looks like they got out at the right time; Tandem closed at $14.50 yesterday. But as the stock has fallen, one newly arrived insider, Ralph K. Ungermann, has been a strong buyer. Largely on the basis of his purchases, Tandem tops the Insider Trading Spotlight this week with 18 times normal insider-buying volume.    Mr. Ungermann is chairman and president of Ungermann-Bass Inc., a data communications firm acquired by Tandem for $260 million earlier this year. Following the acquisition, Mr. Ungermann became a Tandem vice president and director. In the spring, he bought 34,100 shares at $17 to $17.50 a share. Last month, in 10 transactions, he bought an additional 50,000 shares, for $13 to $14.125.    &quot;I'm purchasing for the long term,&quot; he says. &quot;I believe Tandem is going to be a very major factor in the (computer) industry long term. I'm averaging out over time, and building a major position in the company.&quot;    ---   An Old Habit: A closely held company controlled by the family of M.J. Fielding bought 785,757 shares of Canadian Pacific Ltd. in late August and early September for about $16 million, adding roughly a third to the family's holding.    Mr. Fielding, who is a director of Canadian Pacific, would say only, &quot;We have been purchasing Canadian Pacific shares for years because we always thought it was a good investment.&quot;    Canadian Pacific benefited from two favorable developments this month. Newsprint prices rose, and Canadian authorities approved subsidies for an oil project in which the company has a 10% stake. Both developments were widely anticipated. Mr. Fielding declined to be interviewed, so he couldn't be asked whether anticipation of either development influenced his timing.    No quick profit was involved. Canadian Pacific closed yesterday at $17.625. The recent Fielding purchases were at prices above $20.    ---   The Fruits of Yogurt: Frank D. Hickingbotham, chairman of TCBY Enterprises Inc., netted $5.2 million by selling just 4% of his shares in the yogurt retailer, which was recently listed on the New York Stock Exchange.    The company's initials stand for &quot;The Country's Best Yogurt.&quot; Previously its name was This Can't Be Yogurt Inc., but that phrase was dropped in 1984 after it settled a lawsuit brought by I Can't Believe It's Yogurt Inc.    ---   Karen Blumenthal and Peggy Berkowitz contributed to this article. </TEXT></DOC>
