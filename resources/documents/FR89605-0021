Presently, all administrative civil penaltiesassessed under the Consolidated Rules must be paid to the Treasurer ofthe United States of America. Section 207 of Title II of the Toxic SubstancesControl Act (TSCA), 15 U.S.C. 2647 (enacted in section 2 of the AsbestosHazard Emergency Response Act of 1986 (AHERA)), however, requires thatall civil penalties collected from local educational agencies under TitleII be used by the local educational agencies for purposes of complyingwith Title II. Any portion of a collected civil penalty remaining unspentafter compliance by a local educational agency is completed must be depositedinto the Asbestos Trust Fund established under section 5 of AHERA. Thisrule amends the Consolidated Rules of Practice to modify penalty collectionprocedures as they pertain to collection of penalties under TSCA TitleII.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>EFFECTIVE DATE: </T2>July 5, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2>Jon D.
