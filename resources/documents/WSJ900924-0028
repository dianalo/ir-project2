DeKlerk, who is scheduled to lunch with President Bush today,knows not to expect the kind of reception accorded NelsonMandela. Yet he is at least as important to South Africa'sfuture as Mr. Mandela: Archbishop Desmond Tutu has proposedthat the two men be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize jointly.   Mr. De Klerk's decision to release all political prisonersand unban organizations like the African National Congress,the Communist Party and the Pan Africanist Congress, withoutrequiring them first to qualify their long-standingcommitment to the &quot;armed struggle,&quot; normalized South Africanpolitics. South African politics, for so long dominated by aconstituency of 5 million whites, have become the politics ofmore than 35 million people.</LP><TEXT>   Now a new pattern of race relations, free of apartheid anddiscrimination, has to be worked out. Jobs are required on amassive scale to keep pace with the country's 3% annualpopulation growth. The democratic culture in South Africa isskin-deep: and the prerequisites for democracy -- wide-spreadliteracy, adequate and equitably distributed incomes,industrialization and urbanization, shared values, and ashared sense of nationhood -- are at best weakly present.   The transition to non-racialism could still be disruptedeither by a resurgence of Afrikaner nationalism, or byintra-black ethnic rivalry, or by the violence of the &quot;lostgenerations,&quot; the young blacks who dropped out of school andsociety after 1976, and are now largely beyond the reach ofthe main political organizations.   But the transition itself is irreversible. Americananti-apartheid organizations understandably claim that thesanctions in the Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act of 1986,have been instrumental in bringing about the change. Idisagree with this view, but the disagreement is nowacademic. The question Americans should be asking now is not:&quot;What do we do to end apartheid?&quot; but rather &quot;How do we helpSouth Africans achieve a non-racial democracy?&quot; Mr. DeKlerk's visit is the occasion to begin to answer thatquestion.   In the first place, Americans should make their experiencein race relations more readily available to South Africa. TheAmerican lesson for South Africa is that individuals andsocieties can change. Because the American attitude towardSouth Africa has been so moralistic, Americans have refusedto recognize that their experience in race relations -- boththe successes and the failures of residential desegregation,affirmative action, rights of voluntary association,definitions of individual and group rights -- are alsorelevant in South Africa's circumstances.   No issue is more important to South Africa's future thanthe form of its economy. While the present economy, with itsracial disparities in income, wealth and public spending, isunacceptable to the majority of South Africans, the simpleexpedient of &quot;nationalization&quot; will not work either. Here,too, outsiders can contribute.   South Africa will need a great deal of foreign investment,and not just for economic reasons. Multinationalcorporations, and their South African equivalents have helpedto ameliorate some of the worst of the hardships of SouthAfrican life. Will TransAfrica representatives turn up atU.S. shareholder meetings to ask chief executives, &quot;Why isyour company not active in South Africa?&quot;   Alan Keyes, a former U.S. ambassador to the UnitedNations, has argued that America's objective should be tohelp &quot;South African blacks become richer rather than poorer,stronger rather than weaker, more hopeful rather than moredesperate.&quot; By promoting &quot;black empowerment&quot; through thetrade unions, through education and training, and byassisting black small business, the U.S. can create asituation in which more equal bargaining is possible.   Finally, while there is no need at the moment for outsidefacilitators in South Africa's constitutional negotiations,hitches will occur. Mr. De Klerk's visit gives President Busha chance to demonstrate that the U.S. can adopt aneven-handed approach to the situation.   For more than a decade, many American politicians haveused South Africa to win votes in American politics. ButSouth Africa's significance transcends apartheid. If SouthAfricans can live together in peace and harmony, then nocountry in the world with similar problems has reason tothrow up its hands and say: &quot;We cannot find the answer]&quot;   ---   Mr. Worrall, formerly South Africa's ambassador toBritain, is a Democratic Party Member of Parliament.</TEXT></DOC>
