Mrs. Aquino told a press conference the small team ofBritish military personnel has been brought in to train thePresidential Security Group, an elite force of 3,000 men thatguards her.   The president, who has survived six coup attempts in thepast four years, said the training was being provided free aspart of British assistance to the Philippines. She rejectedas untrue allegations that British mercenaries were involved.   The British Embassy, while confirming the presence of ateam of army trainers, declined to specify their exact roleor how many there were. But Philippine military sources saidthe team was made up of about a dozen experts inanti-terrorism techniques, and that they arrived late lastmonth. Anti-Aquino army rebels threaten to attack the Britishofficers if they aren't withdrawn.                                                                                                          JAPANESE ACQUISITIONS ABROAD                                                                                                          Japanese firms purchased 448 foreign companies in thefiscal year ended March 31, up from 334 in fiscal 1988,according to a survey by Yamaichi Securities Co. Foreignfirms acquired only 14 Japanese companies in fiscal 1989,Yamaichi reported.                                                                                                          MEXICAN TRADE                                                                                                          Mexico's new open door trade policy forced 50,000 smalland medium-size businesses to turn to exporting or shut downin 1989, according to a study by Mexico City's MetropolitanUniversity. The industries most affected are clothing,footwear, plastics, electronics, toys, foods and beverages,the study says. Last year, President Carlos Salinas deGortari's government approved new foreign trade ruleslowering duties and lifting restrictions on imports, with theaim of making Mexican companies more competitive at home andabroad.                                                                                                          FORTRESS EUROPE?                                                                                                          The U.S. International Trade Commission says U.S. businessstill worries that greater unity among West Europeans willlead to a &quot;Fortress Europe&quot; designed to protect theircompanies against U.S. goods and services. American intereststhat could be hurt, according to the ITC, range from the saleof insurance to the showing of U.S. television shows.                                                                                                          JAPANESE TANKER ORDER                                                                                                          Hitachi Zosen Corp., a leading Japanese shipbuilding firm,received an order for a crude-oil tanker valued atapproximately $82.3 million. According to the Japan ShipExporters Association, that's the highest price paid for aJapanese tanker since 1973, when the world shipbuildingindustry contracted because of soaring oil prices. Hitachisaid it will build the 280,000-grossmetric-ton oil carrierfor Britain-based Lykiardopuro andamp; Co., and deliver the ship inearly 1993.                                                                                                          CRIME IN POLAND                                                                                                          Crime is soaring in post-Communist Poland at a time whenpolice are short of manpower, money and public trust.   The number of crimes jumped 80% in 1989, to more than500,000. Nearly a third were property crimes, traceable inpart to the worsening economic situation.   Muggings increased by 26%. The number of reported rapesrose, while murders remained steady at about 500 a year.   But the police force is shrinking as crime grows. Col.Wojciech Garstka, spokesman for the Interior Ministry, saysWarsaw alone has 3,200 vacancies. Low pay and public distrustaccount for the failure to attract new recruits, despite thesurge in unemployment accompanying economic reform, says Col.Garstka.                                                                                                          POSTSCRIPTS . . .                                                                                                          Forget the yen, mark and franc. Buy dong. Thanks to atough package of economic reforms, the Vietnamese currencyhas soared in the past year, strengthening by 50% against thedollar. . . . Brazil won't build a nuclear bomb, says JoseLuiz de Carvalho Santana, the new head of that country'sNuclear Energy Commission. According to U.S. scientists,Brazil's secret uranium-enrichment plant at Aramar, in SaoPaulo state, could easily be adapted to make a bomb.</TEXT></DOC>
