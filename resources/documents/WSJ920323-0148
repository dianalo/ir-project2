Thereis no basis in fact for such statements as, &quot;There is nodoubt that General Motors as a company is broken in body,mind and spirit.&quot;   The list of &quot;GM outside directors&quot; to whom he addresseshis attack contains the names of three people who retiredfrom the GM board a year ago (James Evans, John Horan andGeorge Shultz), and he omitted another outstanding current&quot;GM outside director,&quot; Leon Sullivan, who, interestingly, hasthe longest service of any current GM director. It is perhapssignificant, in evaluating the accuracy of the article, thatformer Secretary of State Shultz's name would not only bemistakenly included, but misspelled as well.</LP><TEXT>   Speaking only for myself (I will leave it to GM and itsrecord to refute Mr. Falvey), it seems fair to say that yourreaders deserve more accurate information.
