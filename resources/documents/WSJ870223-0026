After meeting in Washington last week with Reagan administration officials, Mr. Noir said he received a &quot;favorable&quot; U.S. response to the idea.    But Deputy U.S. Trade Representative Michael Smith said that, while the U.S. and the European Community are exchanging certain information about Japanese import restrictions, it doesn't mean that they will agree to take &quot;concerted actions&quot; against Japan.    The French trade minister told reporters that the U.S. and the EC should pick some specific issue, such as Japan's restrictions on wine imports, for concerted market-opening pressure and perhaps &quot;coercive&quot; joint action in the name of trade reciprocity.    Mr. Noir said trade officials in the U.S. and Western European countries plan to discuss the issue further. </TEXT></DOC>
