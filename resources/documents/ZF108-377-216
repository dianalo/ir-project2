(graph)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>ARE YOU READY FOR ETHERNET?andM;When the first Mac rolled out of Cupertino back in 1984, users-to-be wereseduced by its civilized approach to personal computing.andP;  Though the Mac'selegant interface stole the headlines, a less heralded feature -- a built-innetwork hookup -- was equally revolutionary.andP;  As manufacturers began to takeadvantage of this LocalTalk connection, the isolated desktop-computer usergradually evolved into a member of a file-swapping, printer-sharing,electronic-mail-sending community.andM;LocalTalk is convenient, but today's 24-bit color, sound, and animationapplications create files so enormous that LocalTalk just can't keep up --especially on large, heavily used networks.andP;  Desktop publishers, multimediadesigners, database specialists -- anyone who moves large amounts ofinformation -- find themselves drumming their fingers on their desktops,waiting while LocalTalk strangles on large file transfers.andP;  A faster networkis needed -- and, luckily, it's here.andP;  This month, MacUser NetWorkShop slipsinto network overdrive to test interface cards and SCSI adapters that linkyour Mac to the high-speed world of Ethernet.andM;Net NeedsandM;Today's top-of-the-line IIfx is barely recognizable as a descendant of theoriginal Mac.andP;  But despite all the improvements over the years -- hard-diskdrives, more RAM, faster microprocessors, SCSI -- the Mac's built-inLocalTalk network scheme remains essentially unchanged.andP;  For most users, thisconsistency is a blessing.andP;  Macs of all vintages can easily and inexpensivelyshare printers and file servers.andP;  LocalTalk fulfills Apple's original goal ofmaking small-group networking available to every Mac user.andM;But as networks grow in size and carry more traffic, the Mac's built-inLocalTalk transceiver (network hardware) begins to show the strain.andP;  Becauseonly one Mac can use a network at any one time (see the &quot;How It Works&quot;sidebar), the more nodes (Macs, printers, file servers) that are trying toaccess your network, the longer you'll wait for your turn.andP;  Because biggerfiles take longer to transfer, this choking increases with file size.andM;LocalTalk and its governing specifications, AppleTalk (see the glossary in&quot;How to Set Up the Perfect Network&quot; in this buyer's guide), have anotherlimitation that may be more important to your workplace than speed: &quot;They'reused mostly in Mac-only networks.andP;  As more Macs appear in business,government, and universities, users need access to information stored inminicomputers or PC networks.andP;  A connectivity solution (Mac-to-non-Maccommunication) must be found.andM;Ethernet, a tried and true network technology, is one popular solution toboth problems.andP;  Using Ethernet, hundreds of nodes can happily chat at speedswell above that of LocalTalk.andP;  Also, Ethernet's performance degrades far moregradually than LocalTalk's as more nodes are added (see Figure 1).andP;  And sinceits introduction in the early '70s, Ethernet has become the networktechnology of choice for Digital Equipment's VAX line of businessminicomputers as well as in universities and government agencies on differentUNIX-based systems.andM;Mac Ethernet interfaces once belonged to a niche market, were expensive, andwere intended for those few users who would pay anything to get them.andP;  But inthe past two years, the demand for Ethernet has increased, the number ofvendors has proliferated, and costs have come down.andP;  Most interfaces now costaround $600 or $700 -- LocalTalk, remember, comes free with every Mac.andO;Ethernet is quickly entering the mainstream of Mac networking.andP;  If yourgrowing LocalTalk network is chocking on 20-megabyte Adobe Photoshop files,or if you need to talk with that VAX down the hall, now may be the time toswitch to Ethernet.andM;To help you decide your best route into the fast lane, MacUser NetWorkShopevaluated 23 Ethernet interfaces: 9 NuBus cards for the Mac II family, 5cards each for the SE/30 and SE, and 4 external SCSI adapters for use on anySCSI-equipped Mac from the Plus to the IIfx.andP;  We spent a month swapping cardsin and out of the NetWorkShop's two dozen Macs.andP;  We noted file-transfer speedand multiuser-database performance, testing interfaces alternately on anAppleShare file server and on the client (the Mac requesting a file from thefile server).andP;  e crammed our test network full of traffic to see howEthernet's performance compared with LocalTalk's.andP;  We looked at theimportance of having a fast hard-disk drive.andP;  Finally, we wrote a testutility, NetBasher!andP;  (exclusive to MacUser NetWorkShop), to test rawinterface performance without other network influences and bottlenecks.andP;  Weidentified star performers and answered some long-standing questions aboutMac networks.andM;Speed: Greed or Need?andM;If your network is frustratingly slow -- especially when transferring largegraphics, sound, or animation files -- you're a candidate for Ethernet (seethe &quot;Troubleshooting Guide&quot; sidebar).andP;  If you need evidence more concretethan a gut feeling that you're spending too much time watching the littlewristwatch, a network-traffic-monitoring application such as Farallon'sTrafficWatch can tell you how heavily your LocalTalk network is being used.andO;If network use hovers above the 30 percent mark for extended periods, youshould investigate a performance upgrade.andM;Using Ethernet is just one of many ways to improve network performance (see&quot;Making a Small Net Work,&quot; May '89, page 151).andP;  But even if you use yourfastest CPU as a file server, the quickest hard-disk drives available, and anetwork layout (or topology) that's been perfectly designed to reducecross-network traffic, LocalTalk can't transfer data faster than 230.4 kbps(kilobits, or thousands of bits, per second), Ethernet's top speed of 10 Mbps(megabits, or millions of bits, per second) is more than 40 times faster.andM;But real-world restraints can conspire to prevent networks from performing attheir theoretical limits.andP;  Our testing showed that Ethernet provided at mosta 5:1 performance increase over LocalTalk for most common networkingfunctions.andP;  Although a 500-percent performance gain is certainly nothing tosneeze at, it does show that theoretical limits are just that--theoretical.andO;Many factors contribute to this gap between the ideal and the real, but ourtesting showed that the most important constraint on file-server performanceis the speed of its hard-disk drive.andP;  Network overhead is another limitingfactor, as is CPU speed (for the Plus and SE) and data collisions (see the&quot;How It Works&quot; sidebar).andM;Compared with LocalTalk, Ethernet can carry more data from more devicesbefore performance degrades.andP;  We used Network General's Sniffer, a $17,500network analyzer, to increase the amount of traffic on our Ethernet networkwhile we transferred files between Macs--no problem.andP;  LocalTalk, however,quickly bogged down as we added more traffic.andM;In addition to increase speed, Ethernet gives access to worlds inaccessibleto LocalTalk.andP;  If you communicate with an Ethernet-equipped minicomputer,mainframe, or network, you have two choices: upgrade your entire network fromLocalTalk to Ethernet or connect your LocalTalk network to the Ethernetsystem with a router (see &quot;EtherTalk-to-LocalTalk Routers&quot; in this buyer'sguide).andP;  If you go the all-Ethernet route, you'll still need a router to useyour LaserWrite, because there's currently no way for a LaserWriter (whichhas only a LocalTalk transceiver) to connect directly to an Ethernet network.andM;Getting It TogetherandM;Ethernet interfaces come in two flavors: cards that plug into a slot insidethe Mac and external adapters that plug into the Mac's SCSI port.andP;  If youhave a Mac II, installation is no problem: Just open your Mac, and pop thecard into any available NuBus slot.andP;  SEs and SE/30s have internal PDS(processor direct slot) connectors for the card and a bracket ready for thesecond, smaller card that contains the Ethernet port.andP;  Installation, however,is no piece of cake on an SE or SE/30.andP;  You must carefully open the Mac witha special tool before the PDS and bracket are accessible, and you mustcarefully ground yourself to avoid frying the Mac's motherboard.andP;  Dangerousvoltages lurk within the power supply, plus you void Apple's recentlyextended one-year warranty if you open the case yourself.andP;  In short, get yourdealer to do the installation.andM;If your SE or SE/30's PDS is already filled with a video card, accelerator,or other card, you can still connect to Ethernet, using a SCSI adapter--anexternal box that you plug into the Mac's SCSI port with a standard SCSIcable.andP;  And until someone ships an Ethernet interface for the Mac Portable'sPDS or for the PDS-less Mac Plus, a SCSI adapter is the only possibleEthernet interface for either.andM;A SCSI Ethernet device must share the SCSI bus with other devices such ashard-disk drives.andP;  Because the Mac's SCSI bus is slower than either the NuBusor PDS and because SCSI gives priority to disk-access commands, SCSI Ethernetperformance pays a penalty.andP;  This slowdown is especially noticeable with filetransfers in which the hard-disk drive is being heavily worked at the sametime as the Ethernet interface.andP;  If you're after brute performance, our testsshow that SCSI adapters are not your best choice (see Figure 2).andM;But don't dismiss SCSI adapters entirely.andP;  They're conveniently transportableamong machines and easy to install.andP;  All four SCSI adapters have easilyaccessible switches for setting the SCSI identification number.andP;  The AdaptecNodem is the most versatile, with two 50-pin SCSI ports and an externalterminator plug that lets you place the Nodem anywhere on the SCSI chain.andM;The Compatible Systems Ether+ and Nuvotech NuvoLink SC are internallyterminated and have just one 25-pin SCSI port, so you must place them at theend of the chain--a real problem if you already have an internally terminatedSCSI device.andP;  That the Ether+ and NuvoLink SC should share these and otherfeatures is not surprising, because Compatible Systems manufactures thehardware contained in both.andP;  The internally terminated Dove FastNetSCSI hasone of the most unusual SCSI-connection schemes we've ever seen: An 18-inchcable sticks out of the back, with a 25-pin plug on the end to connect to theMac.andP;  A 25-pin port receives a SCSI cable from the next device in the chain.andM;Before you install an Ethernet NuBus card in your Mac II, you should firstset it to work with the type of cabling you plan to use (for a discussion ofEthernet cabling options, see the &quot;T for Tu?&quot; sidebar and &quot;how to Set Up thePerfect Network&quot; in this buyer's guide).andP;  All NuBus cards require you toinstall jumpers, tiny pins and plugs that fit into and over equally tinysockets and pins.andP;  Cabletron's E6000 requires several jumpers, and itsconfusing manual forced a call to the company's tech-support hot line.andP;  Andalthough we didn't officially judge quality of construction, we couldn't helpbut notice more than two dozen wires hand-soldered to the E6000's circuitboard.andP;  But the card was a top performer, so maybe these last-minute changesare its secret.andM;All the SE/30 and SE cards except 3Com's have external cable-selectionswitches (cracking open an SE case to make the change would be a majorhassle).andP;  3Com makes the switch in software.andP;  The NuvoLink SC and Ether+SCSI-adapter boxes must be opened to get at their cable-switching jumpers,and the Fast-NetSCSI requires an optional transceiver ($100) to connect tothick coaxial cable.andP;  The Nodem can't switch between cable types; you buy themodel that works with your cabling scheme.andM;Drivers' EdandM;After you've popped the card into its slot or plugged in the SCSI adapter,you must install driver software.andP;  Ethernet driver software -- known asEtherTalk -- replaces part of the AppleTalk protocol to let the Maccommunicate over Ethernet cabling while obeying AppleTalk's rules.andP;  Becauseinterface manufacturers use similar hardware, driver-software quality is animportant factor in interface performance.andP;  Our tests showed this to be true.andM;Apple recently enhanced its networking protocol with the release of AppleTalkPhase 2, which includes EtherTalk 2.0 (see the &quot;Phase 2: New and ImprovedAppleTalk&quot; sidebar in &quot;TherTalk-to-LocalTalk Routers&quot; in this buyer's guide).andO;Phase 2 supports a theoretical 16 million devices on a single Ethernet cablesegment, as opposed to the old 254-device limit -- a necessary increase aslareger networkers become the norm.andP;  But not all Ethernet cards come withPhase 2 drivers (see Table 1), although we expect the delinquent vendors tohave Phase 2 drivers available within the next few months.andP;  Phase 2 alsoallows the assignment of different network numbers and zones (network devicegroupings) on a single real world, switching between Phase 1 and 2 is a rareoccurrence.andP;  And when you need to do so, you can avoid craashes by startingup with the Phase 1 drivers active (instead of LocalTalk) and then switchingover to Phase 2 as needed.andM;Some cards take longer than others to switch between Phase 1 and Phase 2drivers.andP;  The SE/30 card from Cabletron takes a disconcerting 15 seconds, forexamples -- and because it gives no onscreen warning that it's busy, we wereat first convinced that our Mac had crashed.andP;  The Racal InterLan for the MacII, on the other hand, switches drivers the fastest (in less than 3 seconds).andM;Foreign AffairsandM;If you plan to use your Ethernet interface to communicate with a VAX or UNIXsystem, you must layer additional software atop your Phase 1 or Phase 2driver.andP;  The most common network protocols in use by these computers areDECnet (VAX) and TCP/IP (both UNIX and VAX).andP;  Some applications that need tospeak these protocols provide and manage this additional software themselves,transparently to users.andP;  For instance, InterCon's TCP/Connect -- a softwarepackage that provides TELNet UNIX terminal emulation and FTP (File TransferProtocol) -- lets users simply launch and go about their business (performremote log-ins, file transfers, and so forth).andP;  In other cases, such as withALisa System's TSSNet (DECnet's analog to TCP/Connect), users must dragspecial INITs and other files into the System Folder.andM;To see whether each Ethernet interface was compatible with TCP/IP, we ranTCP/Connect and logged in remotely to a NeXt, a UNIX machine that speaksTCP/IP.andP;  Each interface performed flawlessly.andP;  Similarly, we tested DECnetcompatibility by running Alisa's TSSNet and copying files between a Mac and aDEC Micro VAX 2000.andP;  The NuBus and SE/30 cards did fine, as did the SCSIinterfaces.andP;  None of the SE cards allowed access to the VAX, however.andO;Although Alisa Systems assured us that it had never experienced this problem,all our efforts to establish an SE-to-VAX link were in vain.andP;  In theblack-magic world of networking, sometimes even the experts are stumped.andM;Diagnostic software and manuals with detailed troubleshooting guides may notseem important features until you find yourself in a similarly vexingsituation.andP;  Of all the documentation we pored through, we especiallyappreciated Dove's thorough manual, which included an excellenttroubleshooting guide, an overview of Ethernet, and general tips on segmentof cable, so we tested different configurations to see if the interfaceswould function properly, find each other, and communicate.andP;  They all did.andM;All vendors use Apple's System Installer to install their EtherTalk driversinto the System file and to copy other necessary files into the SystemFolder.andP;  Once you've installed the drivers, you switch between LocalTalk andEtherTalk by clicking on an icon in the Network cdev.andP;  When we switchedbetween LocalTalk, EtherTalk 1.0 (Phase 1), and EtherTalk 2.0 drivers,however, our SEs and Pluses sometimes crashed.andP;  We discovered that when westarted up an SE or Plus with LocalTalk drivers active, it didn't allocateenough room in memory for a switch to the memory-hungry Phase 2 driver.andO;Luckily, in the networking.andP;  We were also impressed by Dove's diagnosticsoftware, which is easy to operate and gives useful responses.andP;  Cabletronalso has excellent diagnostic software, although it's oriented more to powerusers or technicians than to novices.andP;  At the other end of the spectrum isAsante, with no diagnostic software at all and a manual (a leaflet, actually)containing the bare minimum of information.andM;Speed Is All You NeedandM;Aside from ease of installation and quality of diagnostics, it's easy to tella good Ethernet interface from a not-so-good one: A good one moves filesfast.andP;  We first installed each interface in a client Mac and then swappedlarge and small files to and from a Mac IIcx AppleShare file server (seeFigure 2).andP;  Next we turned the tables by hooking up each interface to theserver and clocking how quickly it could answer simultaneous requests fromthree clients (see Figure 3).andP;  The SCSI adapters underwent two sets of tests:first on a fast SE/30 and then on a pokey Plus.andM;We tested each interface with Phase 1 drivers and again with Phase 2 drivers,if they had been supplied by the interface vendor.andP;  If you're planning toconvert to Phase 2, remember that the vendors who have not yet shipped Phase2 drivers are sure to do so soon.andP;  If you're planning to stay with Phase 1,check out the Phase 2 results anyway -- the speedy performance of most of thePhase 2 drivers might make you rethink your plans.andM;When 400K files are transferred, the speed differences within any class ofinterfaces aren't worth noting.andP;  With files of 2 megabytes and more, however,some interfaces begin to pull away from their pack.andP;  As clients, the AppleEtherTalk NB, Cayman GatorCard E/II, and Racal InterLan MacConnect -- allrunning Phase 1 in a IIcx -- turned in the best performances.andP;  The serverprize goes to the Cabletron E5000 running Phase 2 in an SE/30 (see the&quot;NetResult: The Best File Server&quot; sidebar).andM;Different manufacturers' products win &quot;best of show&quot; on different Macs.andO;Apple, Cayman, and Racal InterLan's all perform well on a client IIcx, butRacal InterLan's falls behind when used in the server.andP;  The Asante MacCon SE30/E and Cabletron E5000 tie as the best client and split the server honors:the MacCon SE 30/E when running Phase 1 and the E5000 for Phase 2.andP;  Dove'sinterfaces fall far behind on both client and server IIcx and SE/30 tests.andO;The FastNet SE gives a strong performance on a client SE but is still beatenhandily by the 3Com EtherLink/SE.andP;  Cabletron's Phase 2 expertise again showsits winning form on the SE tests.andM;In general, the slower the CPU, the slower the performance of Ethernet cards.andO;One interesting exception is the superior server performance put on by theSE/30 cards -- interesting because the SE/30 shares the same CPU as the IIcxwe used to test the NuBus cards.andP;  SCSI adapters turned in the slowest times-- even when linked to a powerful SE/30 -- because they have the limitationsof SCSI to contend with (see &quot;SCSI Accelerators,&quot; March '90, page 175).andM;Of the SCSI adapters, only the Compatible Systems Ether+ and NuvotechNuvoLink SC can be used on AppleShare file servers.andP;  Because of a softwareincompatibility, Apple recommends that you not use SCSI as the Ethernetinterface to AppleShare.andP;  We concur.andP;  Nuvotech and Compatible Systems havecreated a workaround; Adaptec and Dove have not.andP;  But when we tested theserver performance of the Ether+ and NuvoLink SC, we found it nothing towrite home about -- we doubt that the work-arounds were worth the trouble.andO;As clients, the Nuvotech NuvoLink SC and Compatible Systems Ether+ reignsupreme in the SCSI world, with the Nodem and FastNetSCSI lagging far behind.andM;After testing file-transfer speed, we looked at another common network chore:accessing multiuser databases.andP;  We commissioned a network-crunching 4thDimension application from The Automation Group and let it loose to winnowout a winner.andP;  No luck.andP;  Even though we tested every Ethernet interface inevery configuration, no champion emerged in any of the four groups.andO;Apparently, 4th Dimension overhead and hard-disk activity completelyovershadowed differences among the interfaces.andM;This finding -- combined with further investigation -- led to one of our mostimportant conclusions: Much (if not most) of Ethernet's advantage can bewiped out if your hard-disk drive or the hard disk on your server is a dog.andO;To test this hypothesis, we used the fastest NuBus performer, the CaymanGatorCard E/II, on a client IIcx and downloaded a 2-megabyte file from anAppleShare server.andP;  We used three different hard-disk drives on the server: aHeart Data Corp. DCX 45 with a respectable -- if not stunning -- acces timeof 28 milliseconds, a speedy 19-millisecond Heart HD 1085, and a blazinglyfast 10.7-millisecond FWB hammer300FMF.andM;As expected, file-transfer times were fastest for the fastest drive andslowest for the slowest drive -- but the difference was a full 100 percent.andO;If you spend thousands of dollars upgrading your network to Ethernet but failto upgrade your server's haard-disk drive, you're wasting your money.andM;In the RawandM;After uncovering this truth, we stepped beyond the workaday world to testeach interface's raw performance -- that is, how fast it can shovel datawithout being held up by a hard-disk drive, CPU, or SCSI port (see Figure 4).andO;The speeds we uncovered can't be approached in real-world situations, but thereal world is changing as hardware improves.andP;  A Yugo that can keep up with aFerrari from stoplight to stoplight will find itself eating the Ferrari'sdust if someone removes those lights tomorrow.andP;  Similarly, existing networkbottlenecks can be minimized or eliminated, thus unleashing the fastest rawperformers.andM;To test raw performance, MacUser NetWorkShop developed NetBasher! and used itwith Network General's Sniffer to measure how much traffic a particularEthernet interface could transmit and receive.andP;  NetBasher! pushed eachinterface to its limit, whereas Sniffer measured what that limit was.andM;Once again, the top performers were the NuBus cards from Cayman, RacalInterLan, and Cabletron and the SE/30 cards from Asante and Cabletron.andP;  The3Com EtherLink/SE was the SE-card winner, and the Adaptec Nodem led the SCSIpack -- surprising, after its weak file-transfer performance.andP;  And onceagain, Dove's cards fared the worst; Novell's cards didnht put in aparticularly good showing either.andM;The raw-performance tests also showed the value of having a 32-bit-wide databus -- that is, the ability to transfer data 32 bits at a time.andP;  A 32-bit bus(and the driver to capitalize on it) is usable only by SE/30s and the Mac IIfamily because other Macs can accept data only 16 bits at a time.andP;  The fivecards with 32-bit buses finished in the top seven in NetBasher! testing.andO;Surprisingly, the 16-bit Cabletron E6000 and E5000 beat the 32-bit AsanteMacCon II/E and 3Com EtherLink/NB.andM;Many vendors also tout the benefits of large amounts of on-board RAM -- thejustification being that in some situations, bursts of closely spaced packets(referred to as back-to-back packets) arrive too quickly and swamp the Mac'sCPU.andP;  With on-board RAM, these packets can be buffered on the Ethernet carduntil the CPU is free to process them.andP;  Otherwise, the packets will bedropped, meaning they'll be lost and the sender will have to retransmit.andO;Fewer retransmissions equal better performance.andM;We found no correlation between on-board RAM and interface performance,however.andP;  A performance increase might be observed if the interface were usedin a Mac running Apple Internet Router (see &quot;EtherTalk-to-LocalTalk Routers&quot;in this buyer's guide).andP;  A router directs traffic between two or morenetworks and often becomes so besieged by traffic that its CPU cannot keepup.andP;  When this happens, data on the network is dropped and must be re-sent.andO;A RAM buffer might help by storing data until the CPU has time to deal withit -- but we're making no promises.andM;Dove's FastNetSCSI is a unique device.andP;  It contains its own CPU, intended tolighten the Mac's network-processing load.andP;  Unfortunately, no AppleTalksoftware currently exists to take advantage of the FastNetSCSI, and itperformed poorly in all our tests.andP;  We look forward to learning whether theon-board CPU can make a difference if performance-enhancing software is everdeveloped for it.andM;Investment CounselingandM;Installing an Ethernet network is no small investment, in either money ortime.andP;  There's the cost of the interfaces, the inevitable routers, the cable,and -- if you're smart -- fast hard-disk drives for your file servers.andP;  Plus,you must plan your network, install the cable, set up each node, and tune thewhole system to your needs.andP;  Before you start down this slippery slope, werecommend that you examine your needs carefully and do all you can tooptimize your existing LocalTalk network.andM;But if your network is growing, if you're moving large files, or if you needaccess to a VAX or UNIX system, you should definitely investigate Ethernet.andO;With few exceptions, the interfaces we tested offer fast, reliableperformance at a reasonable price.andP;  If budget is a major consideration, werecommend skipping the most expensive interfaces, because the more affordableones perform as well or better.andM;Apple started a revolution when it put network capability into every Mac.andO;Today, manufacturers such as Sun Microsystems and NeXT are upping the ante toEthernet.andP;  Until Apple joins this new network wave, an Ethernet interfacecard may be your best bet for dramatically upgrading your network'sperformance.andM;The Zarboutas brothers are cofounders of Santorini Consutting andamp; Design, Inc.andO;They recently completed work on a major network-management application withFarallon Computing and are planning release of their own products.andM;Troubleshooting GuideandM;Will Ethernet speed up your network?andP;  Not necessarily!andP;  It depends on whatkind of work you're along.andP;  In general, Ethernet will help it users on yournetwork regularly transfer large files (greater than half a megabyte).andP;  OtherLocalTalk troubles require other solutions -- but keep in mind that there arefew hard-and-fast rules.andP;  Network optimization is more art than science.andM;Printing is slow.andM;Ethernet won't help.andM;* Add one more printer.andP;  Use routers to subdivise your internet into smallerwork-group-based networks.andP;  Put users on the same network as the printer theynormally use.andM;* Add a network print spooler.andP;  The AppleShare print server can run on thesame Mac as an AppleShare file server.andM;Mail is slow.andM;Ethernet won't make a big difference -- unless you are attaching large filesto your mail messages.andM;* Subdivide your intermet into smaller work-group networks, using routers.andO;Put a mail server onto each network.andP;  Put each user's mailbox in his or herown network.andM;File transfers are slow.andM;Ethernet should help, but tuning your network may also solve the problem.andM;*If you transfer large files, Ethernet is for you.andP;  If you do upgrade toEthernet, get a faster hard-disk drive for your server.andM;* If most files are small, subdivide your internet with routers and place afile server on each network.andP;  Place each user on the same network as theserver he or she uses most often.andM;* If you can't afford to subdivided and add servers, get a faster CPU foryour existing server.andM;Multiuser-database access is slow.andM;So what else is new?andM;* The bottleneck is probably your database application, not your network.andO;Furthermore, most database access comprises very small data transfers.andO;Ethernet probably won't help much.andM;* Get a faster CPU for your server.andM;* Get a faster hard-disk drive for your server.andM;Your network has too many users.andM;Turning your internet topology may help you solve your problem.andM;* Subdivide your internet with routers.andM;* Put people who communicate with each other most often into the samenetwork.andP;  Try to keep fewer than 20 Macs in each work group.andP;  Place aprinter, a print spooler, a mail server, and a file server in each network.andM;* If users in a work group do a lot of large file transfers, put that workgroup on Ethernet.andM;* If you have a lot of cross-network traffic or several networks, install anEthernet backbone.andP;  (Your routers must then be EtherTalk-to-LocalTalkrouters.)andM;* Avoid transferring large files across routers.andP;  If your network has a lotof users and they all transfer large files frequently, you may be better offwith one large Ethernet network.andM;* Avoid placing users across a router from a file server or printer that theyuse regularly.andP;  With mail servers, have users in the same networks as theserver where they are registered.andM;T for Tu?andM;You've spent thousands of dollars wiring your building with twisted-pairphone wire so you could install a large LocalTalk internet.andP;  Now you want toupgrade to Ethernet, but you don't want to rewire with coaxial cable.andP;  You'veheard that some twisted-pair Ethernet implementations are available, but youdon't want to install something that isn't an accepted standard.andM;Enter 10BASE-T, the about-to-be-adopted Ethernet twisted-pair standard fromIEEE (the institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers).andP;  For severalyears, the IEEE folks--after agreeing on 10BASE-5 for thick coaxial cable(thicknet) and 10BASE-2 for thin coaxial (thinnet, or &quot;cheapernet&quot;)--havebeen arguing over 10BASE-T.andP;  The haggling is finally dying down, and a10BASE-T definition has won preliminary approval.andP;  Expect many interfacemanufacturers to implement it before the year is up.andM;10BASE-T uses an active-star topology and runs over twisted-pair phone wire.andO;A 10BASE-T wire run (the distance allowed between a node and the star hub) islimited to 100 meters (10BASE-5 supports 500-meter runs; 10BASE-2 handles200).andP;  The star topology makes 10BASE-T wiring easier to modify than itscoaxial cousins, however, because the star hub (concentrator) resides at acentral location.andP;  Each Mac must have either an Ethernet interface with a10BASE-T transceiver built in (Cabletron, InterLan, Asante, and Adaptec offerthese for the Mac) or a built-in AUI (Attachment Unit Interface) portconnected to a separate external 10BASE-T transceiver.andM;Some vendors, such as Synoptics, chose not to wait until the 10BASE-Tstandard was settled and established their own standard, called LattisNet.andO;Synoptics' LattisNet hubs and transceivers have been on the Mac market forsome time.andP;  Novell also offers a line of Ethernet interfaces for the Mac thathave LattisNet transceivers built in.andP;  Unfortunately, there is only limitedcompatibility between LattisNet and 10BASE-T products.andP;  In addition to itsLattisNet products, Synoptics sells a 10BASE-T transceiver that can attach toany Ethernet interface that has an AUI port (most do).andP;  Synoptics also offerstwo 10BASE-T hubs.andP;  Synoptics Communications, Inc., 501 E. Middlefield Road,Mountain View, CA 94043-4015; (415) 960-1100.andM;Cabletron began shipping 10BASE-T Ethernet cards in February 1990.andP;  It alsosells Ethernet hubs, which it calls Multi Media Access Centers (MMACs).andP;  Inaddition, Cabletron sells external 10BASE-T transceivers (called TPT-Ts),which can connect to an AUI port on an Ethernet Interface.andP;  CabletronSystems, 35 Industrial Way, Rochester, NH 03867; (603) 332-9400.andM;DAVID Systems has several 10BASE-T products.andP;  Its 10BASE-T DAVID ExpressNetHubs, which began shipping last December, come in three versions thataccommodate 12 to 132 ports.andP;  For those with smaller budgets, DAVID'sVolksNet 10BASE-T hubs (6 to 48 ports) are available at a lower cost perport, but they offer fewer network-management capabilities.andP;  DAVID'sAUI-to-twisted-pair transceivers are called TP-MAUs.andP;  DAVID Systems, 701Evelyn Ave., Sunnyvale, CA 94086; (408) 720-8000.andM;Faralton began shipping its 12-port StarController EN hubs and StarConnectorEN transceivers (which connect to any AUIinterface) in May.andP;  TheStarController EN lets network managers manage Faralton's LocalTalk andEtherTalk StarControllers with the same StarCommand software.andP;  FarallonComputing, 2000 Powell St., Suite 600, Emeryville, CA 94608; (415) 596-9100.andM;NetResult: The Best File ServerandM;Even the faster Ethernet interface is wasted without the right serverhardware.andP;  For the ultimate in file-server performance, MacUser NetWorkShoprecommends a dual-floppy Apple SE/30 ($3,869) with an FWB hammer300FMF300-megabyte hard-disk drive ($4,395).andP;  If you're running EtherTalk Phase 1,install the Asante MacCon SE 30/E ($595); for Phase 2, use the CabletronE5000 ($699).andP;  Either lightning-fast combination will make the most of yourEthernet investment.andP;  FWB, Inc., 2040 Polk St., Suite 215, San Francisco, CA94109; (415) 474-8055.andM;The Bottom LineandM;It wasn't to pick the best Ethernet Interface--it's a dirty, thankless job,but somebody's got to do it.andP;  With few exceptions, the interfaces we testedperformed well, although none stood out as spectacular.andP;  For small filetransfers and multiuser-database access, the differences among interfaces ineach category are minimal--almost imperceptible.andP;  After a month of testing,we discovered that large-file-transfer rates and raw-performance testsseparated the best from the merely good.andM;In addition to identifying the winners in each category, we make oneadditional recommendation: consider price carefully.andP;  Even though list pricesmay seem similar, remember that you'll probably be buying dozens of theseinterfaces if you're upgrading an entire network.andP;  A $100-per-interfacedifference adds up fast -- maybe enough to buy that new llfx you've beeneyeing.andM;There's a good reason why the Cayman GatorCard E/II ($595) and Racal InterLanMacConnect ($549) should share top NuBus honors.andP;  They both use the RacalInterLand card, which is top-notch hardware.andP;  Both led their category in rawperformance and when doing file transfers as a client IIcx.andP;  Apple'sEtherTalk NB ($699) also performed well in real-world tests, but it costs$100 to $150 more.andM;The race was tight in the SE/30-client tests, but the Asante MacCon SE 30/E($595) and the more expensive Cabletron E5000 ($699) pulled away from therest in server performance and buried their competition in raw-performancetests (the MacCon SE 30/E beat all interfacs from all categories).andP;  If you'reinstalling an Ethernet server, you can't do better than an SE/30 with aMacCon Se 30/E running EtherTalk Phase 1 or an E5000 running Phase 2.andM;Our SE-interface testing produced one clear winner: the 3Com EtherLink/SE($595).andP;  Its performance in a client SE was more than acceptable, and in aserver, it even beat most NuBus cards.andP;  Its raw performance was more than 40percent better than that of its nearst competitor, the Cabletron E4000($599).andP;  The folks at 3Com must be confident of the EtherLink/SE's quality,because they stand behind it with a three-year warranty -- the longest in theindustry.andP;  Another SE interface worth looking at is the Asante MacCon SE/E($425).andP;  Its solid real-world performance and excellent price (lowest of allinterfaces) make it a best buy.andM;Although SCSI adapters are, as a group, slower than their card cousins,they're indispensable if you have a Plus or a Portable or no room for anextra card in your SE, SE/30, or II.andP;  The Compatible Systems Ether+ ($495)and Nuvotech NuvoLink SC ($495) use the same hardware to easily beat theirSCSI competitors.andP;  They are clumsy to configure -- the Adaptec Nodem ($495)is far easier to use -- but their performance makes up for it.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
