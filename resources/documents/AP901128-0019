The Lawyers Committee for Human Rights wants to expand a pilotproject run by federal immigration officials in which 200 refugeeswere paroled into their communities in New York, Miami, Los Angelesand San Francisco.   Most of the 200 appeared promptly for immigration hearings andhave not disappeared, the group said in a report released Tuesday.   All were required to post a $500 bond as part of the agreementunder the program, which began in May.   Some 2,000 asylum-seekers are being detained by the Immigrationand Naturalization Service while the government decides whether tosend them back to their home countries. Detention typically lastsfrom nine months to a year.   Among the participants in the pilot project, said the group, wasa 23-year-old woman whose cousins were killed by guerrillas in ElSalvador. She spent over a month in a Los Angeles detentionfacility.   Another was a 29-year-old surgery professor from China whotreated wounded pro-democracy demonstrators. He was held in a Miamidetention center for three months.   ``Hundreds of refugees applying for asylum in the United Statesare unnecessarily detained,'' the committee said. It sent a letterto INS Commissioner Gene McNary asking for expansion of theproject.   The INS said, however, that expansion would be premature at thispoint.   ``So far we like'' the program, said INS spokesman Duke Austin.But he said that it has not yet gone ``through a full cycle ofevents'' and needs to last for its full, scheduled 18 months beforefinal evaluation.   Parolees have agreed to report voluntarily for deportation ifimmigration officers determine they fail to qualify for asylum.   ``We'll wait to see what happens'' on the question of whetherthey disappear, Austin said.   He questioned how much the program could be expanded, callingthe 200 the ``best-case situations - They've got work, got anaddress, they don't appear to be abscondee types.''   Under a 1982 INS regulation, aliens arriving without requiredtravel documents are detained unless they are found to pose no riskof absconding and can get a relative or sponsor in this country tofile a petition on their behalf.   Most aliens seeking asylum are unable to meet thoserequirements, says Helton, who lobbied the INS to launch the pilotproject.</TEXT></DOC>
