(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Criminal charges won't be soughtagainst the former president of Westfield State College, whoresigned last month amid a trustees' investigation into his allegeduse of school trust funds for personal expenses.   Hampden County District Attorney Matthew J. Ryan said Wednesdayhe made the decision not to prosecute the former official, IrvingH. Buchen, after reviewing the trustees' report.   ``I don't think a criminal proceeding at this particular time,which would be a long drawn out process before a grand jury, wouldbe of any value to the Commonwealth or Westfield State College,''he said.   He said investigators found ``a great deal of slipshod recordkeeping'' and ``use of poor judgment.'' But, pointing to the broaddiscretionary powers college presidents enjoy in the use of trustfunds, he said it would be very difficult to establish criminalintent beyond a reasonable doubt.   Ryan called on the Legislature to tighten controls over the useof college trust funds. Current statutes give college presidentssole authority to use trust fund money for any item they feel willbenefit the institution.   John St. Clair, chairman of the Westfield State Collegetrustees, declined to release the trustees report, but said it hasbeen submitted to a legislative subcommittee investigating the useof college trust funds. He also said trustees were tightening theirown policies.   Buchen, 57, resigned on July 27 after having headed the collegefor 15 months. He succeeded Francis J. Pilecki, who left amidcharges of sexual misconduct with male students, and a furor overthe payment of $10,000 out of trust funds to one of the students.   The trustees launched their three-week investigation in Julyafter the Union-News of Springfield had reported that Buchen billedcollege trust funds for $3,400 in expenses by submitting allegedlyinaccurate or questionable vouchers for travel and dinners.   The newspaper said its review of the bills showed that Buchenhad been reimbursed for vacation expenses in Florida, his wife'stravel and dinners with non-existant faculty members. He alsobilled the college for dinners in California and Florida with othercollege presidents and a trustee, who maintained they had not eatenwith him.   He later paid back $1,259.</TEXT></DOC>
