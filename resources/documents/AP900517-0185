Lay and clergy delegates to the church's general synod voted infavor of the change for the second time this week, approving thelast stage of the bill.   Anglicans in England, Scotland and Wales do not allow women tobe priests. About 1,000 women have been ordained to the priesthoodin one-quarter of the 27 Anglican churches, most of them in theUnited States, Canada and New Zealand.   On Tuesday, clerical members of the church secured the necessarytwo-thirds majority by four votes, but there had been speculationThursday's follow-up vote would reverse that decision.   Delegates instead heeded a strongly worded request fromArchbishop Robin Eames of Armagh, the leader of the church, to voteto ensure the bill's passage.   The proposal was backed overwhelmingly by lay voters and byalmost 70 percent of the clergy.   The Church of Ireland has 410,000 members, most of them in theBritish province of Northern Ireland.   Church officials said it will probably be months before anywomen become priests. There are six woman deacons and four intraining.   The majority of Ireland's population belong to the RomanCatholic Church, which opposes the ordination of women.</TEXT></DOC>
