The unprecedented measure _ affecting 700,000 people _ came aday after Parliament approved Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's peaceplan calling for elections in the occupied lands to choosePalestinian delegates for autonomy talks with Israel.   Also today, an 18-year-old Palestinian from the West Bankrefugee camp of Dheishe died eight days after being shot in thehead during a clash with troops, the army said. Arab hospitalofficials identified him as Ali Zghari.   The death brought to 482 the number of Palestinians killed sincethe December 1987 start of the Palestinian uprising against Israelioccupation. Twenty-one Israelis have also been slain.   At least 14 Palestinians were shot and wounded in clashes withsoldiers in the West Bank and Gaza Strip today, Arab reports andhospital officials said.   One was a 13-year-old boy listed in critical condition inTulkarem Hospital with a wound in the chest. He was shot at theWest Bank's Tulkarem Refugee Camp, where soldiers fired on youthsdefying a curfew in effect for five days, according to Arab reports.   Much of the West Bank and Gaza Strip were shut down by a generalstrike called by the Moslem fundamentalist movement ``Hamas,'' orzeal, to protest Israeli interference with mosques.   The army, which imposed a general curfew on the Gaza Strip onMonday, lifted the restrictions in Gaza City and several otherareas today but continued to bar all Gazans from entering Israel.On Tuesday, authorities forced all Gazans still in Israel to returnto their homes.   The closure and the permit requirements are part of a new armycrackdown on the uprising. In the West Bank, home to 1 millionPalestinians, troops have resumed arrest raids in isolated Arabvillages, a practice that led to many casualties and was abandonedfor several months.   The new permits ``will improve our ability of supervising theentry of Palestinians from the occupied territories to Israel,''said the military official, speaking on condition of anonymity.   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin indicated that Palestiniansactive in the uprising would be denied permits.   ``We distinguish between those Palestinians who would like tocontinue their lives in a normal way regardless of what politicalviews or political aspirations they may have and those whoparticipate in violence,'' he told the Jerusalem Post newspaper.   Rabin said the peace initiative and crackdown were part of thesame policy. The Palestine Liberation Organization and manyprominent Palestinians in the occupied territories have rejectedShamir's peace plan because it does not provide for eventualPalestinian statehood.   Rabin said the new restrictions were meant ``to send a clearmessage to the Palestinians: Forget about bringing about anychanges in the political initiative through stones or firebombs.''   The military official said Palestinians convicted of seriouscrimes, such as murder or armed robbery, would also be barred fromIsrael but that details were still being worked out.   Officials said 28,000 Palestinians have been convicted of crimesin Israel in the past 10 years.   Rabin said the army could start issuing permits by the end ofMay, and expected the process to be completed within three months.   It was not immediately clear whether Gazans would be confined tothe Gaza Strip until all permits have been issued.   The closure will have the strongest affect on the 50,000 Gazanswho work in Israel and whose low-paying jobs in farming,construction and municipal services are their only source ofincome. About 60,000 West Bank Palestinians also work in Israel.   In the past few days, officials in several Israeli cities havedebated proposals to fire workers from the occupied lands and hireunemployed Israelis for higher wages.   Tel Aviv Mayor Shlomo Lahat said today that only companies whoseemployees are Israeli citizens will get contracts for streetcleaning. Currently, most Tel Aviv street cleaners are Gaza Stripresidents.   ``To take the residents from the territories, and give them thework we, the Israelis, don't want to do is unethical, unhealthy,''Lahat said on Israel radio.</TEXT></DOC>
