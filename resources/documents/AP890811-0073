The agency said more attempts were planned Saturday and Sunday.   The satellite was launched Tuesday night by an Ariane rocket. Itis in a safe orbit and all other systems are operating normally,the agency said.   But if not placed in a higher orbit soon, the satellite will bepulled back to earth.   The satellite, launched from the European Space Agency's centerin Kourou, French Guiana, is on a mission to plot withunprecedented precision the position and motion of 120,000 stars.   A secondary experiment is to provide less precise dataconcerning 400,000 stars.   A first effort to light the satellite's engine to boost it intogeostationary orbit failed for unknown reasons Thursday. Theagency's engineers in Darmstadt, West Germany, tried again thismorning, with no results.</TEXT></DOC>
