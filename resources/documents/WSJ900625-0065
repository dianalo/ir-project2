After consistently dismissing Mr. Yeltsin publicly andprivately as an eccentric or even dangerous demagogue,administration officials now say they are gaining a newrespect for the beefy radical. They cite his political skillin winning election as president of the Russian republic whenmounting political woes are afflicting the man who is stillPresident Bush's favorite Soviet politician, MikhailGorbachev.</LP><TEXT>   For fear of offending the Soviet president, top officialsstill won't publicly say a kind word about Mr. Yeltsin, whohas been Mr. Gorbachev's chief left-wing critic. But inprivate they're much more positive about him now.   &quot;There's been a certain evolution in people's views herelately,&quot; says one important U.S. foreign policy official. &quot;Hehas shown a political adeptness that has made people here situp and think.&quot; A second senior official says: &quot;He has to betaken seriously. He represents real democratic forces in theSoviet Union.&quot;   That isn't to say the U.S. is rooting for Mr. Yeltsin orshying away from Mr. Gorbachev. All recent evidence points toa continuing close tie between President Bush and the currentSoviet leader. The Bush administration doesn't even have apost-Gorbachev plan. And the newest generation of Sovietreformers -- such as Moscow Mayor Gavril Popov and Leningradleader Anatoly Sobchak -- rarely makes it onto theadministration's foreign policy radar screen, even thoughmany Soviet experts in the West view them as more genuinelyinclined toward democracy than either Mr. Gorbachev or Mr.Yeltsin.   The new regard for Mr. Yeltsin is largely a result ofrespect for the raw political skill and appeal he hasdemonstrated in climbing from political oblivion to headRussia, which occupies two-thirds of Soviet territory.   There is still grave doubt about his dedication toWestern-style government and economics and considerablenervousness about his tendency to pop off in public.   U.S. officials weren't thrilled recently when Mr. Yeltsinsaid he wanted Russia to have a foreign policy &quot;independent&quot;of the Soviet Union's. And they are deeply skeptical when hepromises an unspecified market reform plan that he pledgeswon't burden average citizens. But officials here are nowunwilling to write him off on the basis of some of theseoff-the-cuff remarks. &quot;We don't know what he'll produce,&quot;says a high official. &quot;But we're taking a wait-and-seeattitude.&quot;   It was Mr. Yeltsin's blustery rhetoric that turned theadministration against him in the first place. LastSeptember, while visiting the White House and StateDepartment, he came across as disorganized and impractical intalks with Mr. Bush, Secretary of State James Baker andNational Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft. Among otherthings, he touted wild schemes -- proposing, for instance,that U.S. companies build a million apartments in theU.S.S.R.   The view of Mr. Yeltsin as simply an erratic populist wasreinforced by tales of heavy drinking during his U.S. tourand by private criticism from Mr. Gorbachev right up throughthe recent Washington summit, where the Soviet leader toldsome U.S. officials Mr. Yeltsin was only a &quot;destroyer&quot; andhad no constructive reform proposals.   Even some leading Soviet liberals reinforced that view. &quot;Icannot imagine how Yeltsin could go to Washington and havenegotiations with Bush and Baker,&quot; says Andrei Kortunov, areformist Moscow foreign policy expert whose views arefollowed closely in Washington. &quot;It would be ridiculous,because he doesn't know anything about foreign policy.&quot;   But one senior administration official now concedes thatthe initial negative U.S. assessment was an overreaction andthat &quot;Yeltsin isn't some drunken buffoon.&quot;   One reason for the cautious turnaround may be pressurefrom U.S. conservatives, who have pressed the White House tohedge its bets on Mr. Gorbachev. They argue that hispolitical survival isn't as crucial as it once seemed becausehe might be succeeded by an even more liberal figure, notablyMr. Yeltsin or Mr. Popov or Mr. Sobchak.   &quot;We should not be comfortable about him {Mr. Yeltsin}, butwe should give him the benefit of the doubt,&quot; says Leon Aron,a Soviet expert at the conservative Heritage Foundation whois writing a book about Mr. Yeltsin. &quot;For years, we've beenpining for a democratically elected leader there, and inYeltsin we've come closer than ever to having that kind of aRussian politician. So we should have a cautious attitude,but we can't dismiss him.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
