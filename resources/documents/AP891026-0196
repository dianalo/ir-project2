Sets Up Centers for Day Laborers, Prompting Immigration Worries</HEAD><BYLINE>By E. SCOTT RECKARD</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Day laborers, many of them undocumentedaliens who hang out on street corners in hopes of finding work,have a new friend beginning Friday: the city of Los Angeles. Butimmigration officials are concerned.   City officials hope the program will help keep aliens from beingexploited and will quiet the complaints of merchants and residentsnear the many unofficial gathering spots for people seekingconstruction or landscaping work.   The six-month test project is ``a fair compromise on a difficultissue,'' Councilman Richard Allatore said in February, when the15-member City Council unanimously approved the $90,000 program.   But federal immigration officials say contractors and otheremployers will have no assurances the workers are legal and willrisk fines under the 1986 immigration reform law, which penalizesemployers who knowingly hire unauthorized aliens.   Benjamin G. Davidian, western regional commissioner of theImmigration and Naturalization Service, said Thursday the city willnot check to determine whether workers are authorized but willsimply match them up with potential employers.   ``They may cause potential employers to be misled into thinkingthey're getting workers who have a government stamp of approval forhiring,'' Davidian said.   Davidian said there had been meetings with city officials todiscuss the program. ``We're trying to work out the best approachfor everyone.''   He did not guarantee there would be no raids of the centers, butsaid, ``I'm not going to send a phalanx of Border Patrol agents tosweep through the hiring halls on a daily basis.''   Davidian said he would have preferred a program like that in theOrange County city of Costa Mesa, which has banned laborers fromseeking work on the streets and instead checks their documents at acity-run hiring hall.   Los Angeles officials and immigrants rights groups havecountered that the city has no legal or moral duty to checkworkers' documentation.   Although residents and merchants in cities throughout SouthernCalifornia have complained about the job-hunters, immigrants rightsgroups say the right to gather on the streets and seek work isconstitutionally protected.   ``People are always talking about these lazy, shiftless welfarepeople. Here we have a group of people who want to work,'' saidLinda Mitchell of the Coalition for Humange Immigrant Rights of LosAngeles, an umbrella group for about 50 organzations.   Ms. Mitchell said the job centers will create a betterenvironment for the workers.   At the center opening Friday in the Harbor City district, twoSpanish-speaking city workers with a phone will keep tabs on whatkind of workers employers need and what skills workers have.   Social service workers are expected to drop in from time to timeto offer free English classes and health-care information.   If the project succeeds, the number of job centers will increaseto 15.   The mostly male, mostly Hispanic job-seekers _ some withoutskills, some talented craftsmen _ have gathered informally on thecity's streets for years. Their numbers have increased since the1986 immigration law.   Not all the workers are unauthorized. In July 1988, for example,63 illegal aliens were arrested in sweeps of sections of Placentiaand Orange where day laborers gather. But about the same numberproved they had applied for amnesty.</TEXT></DOC>
