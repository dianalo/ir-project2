The agreement, which follows a decade-long effort by the utility to obtain an operating license, would give the citizens group a formal voice in certain safety and other oversight activities involving the plant. In addition, the Dallas-based utility agreed to reimburse the consumer group's expenses for the last 10 years and to underwrite certain expenses for the next five years.    In exchange for these concessions, the consumer group agreed to file a motion to dismiss licensing hearings for the plant that threatened to add another lengthy step to the Comanche Peak project, which is already severely delayed and over budget. Both sides said the agreement could avoid delays of between six months and as much as three years in the date of fuel-loading for the plant, currently scheduled for mid-1989.    &quot;Texas Utilities came to the recognition that the citizens were going to be with them forever,&quot; said Billie P. Garde, a lawyer representing the 14-year-old Citizens Association for Sound Energy. For its part, Texas Utilities said approval of the motion for dismissal of the group's complaints &quot;would eliminate some uncertainties that could have adversely affected the company's current estimate for cost and schedule.&quot;    Comanche Peak's licensing process was suspended in January 1985 amid allegations of improper design and construction. Licensing hearings were expected to resume this fall, 16 years after construction began.    The agreement must be approved by the federal Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, an administrative judicial board of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. The pact, which lawyers familiar with the case and others said was unprecedented in the utility industry, was signed by the NRC staff, Texas Utilities and Juanita Ellis, the 52-year-old former church secretary who heads the Citizens Association.    Mrs. Ellis said that the agreement provides the citizens group broadened access to challenge Texas Utilities on safety and other concerns. Otherwise, &quot;Once the (licensing) hearings are over, that is where our rights would end, and we couldn't get another scrap of paper from the utility,&quot; Mrs. Ellis said.    Under the proposed agreement, Mrs. Ellis would be placed on the plant's operations review committee for at least five years, or until one year of commercial operation of Comanche Peak's second unit. In addition, the utility agreed to notify the citizens group of any proposed change in its reinspection programs and in certain audit documents. A technical consultant to the citizens group will be allowed to accompany personnel performing such audits.    In addition, new procedures would make it easier for workers to raise safety and quality-related concerns free of the threat of harassment or intimidation. And a program to investigate worker allegations will continue until at least 1993.    Comanche Peak, located 75 miles southwest of Dallas, has been under controversy for nearly as many years as it has been under construction. Like many nuclear projects, Comanche Peak has been plagued by cost overruns and delays. But allegations of improper design and construction and harassment of quality assurance inspectors grew so severe that the NRC sent a special team to the Glen Rose, Texas plant, which triggered Texas Utilities' move to hire outside experts for a plant reinspection. Ultimately, the reinspection evolved into a 100% review of the plant's design and construction.    Texas Utilities, the state's largest electric utility with some two million customers, owns 87.8% of the nuclear project and has agreed to purchase another 6.2%. In a revolt over staggering cost overruns, three of Texas Utilities' partners sued the utility. One partner has settled, a second is in negotiations and a third has an October court date with the utility. </TEXT></DOC>
