It is shown that using the Sun as a source of arionsit is easy to surpass the astrophysical limit for its existence in alaboratory experiment, while it is practically impossible for axions.The connection between the arion left-right-arrow photon oscillationsin a homogeneous magnetic field and the production of photons by axionsin an inhomogeneous field is discussed. The oscillations in a mediumwith a refraction index nnot =1 are also considered.</TEXT></DOC>
