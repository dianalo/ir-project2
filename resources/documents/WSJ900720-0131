Mr. Paisley hasn't been charged with any wrongdoing, and afinal agreement hasn't been signed. But if the talks, asexpected, produce a settlement, it would be the climax of thegovernment's much-publicized investigation of Pentagonprocurement fraud dubbed &quot;Operation Ill Wind.&quot; Somelaw-enforcement officials said they expect an agreement bythe fall.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Paisley's attorney, Lawrence Barcella, who hasmaintained in the past that his client didn't violate anylaws, declined to comment on any discussions withprosecutors. &quot;It rarely serves anyone's interests to discusswhether or not a target&quot; of a criminal probe or his attorneyare &quot;having conversations with the government,&quot; Mr. Barcellasaid earlier this week. The settlement discussions were firstreported by the Seattle Post-Intelligencer.   The talks picked up steam in the past few weeks, accordingto law-enforcement officials, as investigators pored overstatements and other evidence provided by William Galvin, aformer close associate of Mr. Paisley. Mr. Galvin, who wasone of the most influential and highly paid defense-industryconsultants, pleaded guilty four months ago to bribing Mr.Paisley and agreed to cooperate with prosecutors.   Federal investigators and court documents have describedMr. Paisley as the alleged centerpiece of various schemesthat improperly supplied bid-related information to certainconsultants and tried to steer lucrative contracts to severalof the concerns they represented. Officials familiar with thecase said prosecutors have considered seeking bribery,conspiracy, fraud and other charges against Mr. Paisley, whowas a Boeing Co. executive before he came to the Pentagon inPresident Reagan's first term.   Relying partly on Mr. Galvin's cooperation, prosecutorsalso continue to assemble evidence against Victor Cohen, asenior Air Force acquisition official and the otherindividual who remains a major target of the long-runningAlexandria, Va., grand-jury inquiry. Mr. Galvin, as part ofhis guilty plea, admitted to conspiring to bribe Mr. Cohen aspart of an influence-peddling scheme.   Mr. Cohen still works for the Air Force but has beenremoved from acquisition decisions. Since his name surfacedin the investigation, he has denied any improprieties. Somelaw-enforcement officials insisted that Mr. Cohen, too, hasbeen considering a plea agreement. But in a brief interview,Mr. Cohen said: &quot;I can assure you there is no negotiation orplea bargaining under way.&quot;   Prosecutors have secured more than 30 convictions in thethree-year-old inquiry, including several prominent industryconsultants, a number of midsized defense contractors andsome relatively low-level Pentagon officials. If Mr. Paisleyagrees to cooperate with the government, investigators hopeto learn more about the role of major contractors, seniordefense-industry executives and Pentagon higher-ups in thescandal.</TEXT></DOC>
