Michael Blumenthal in a manifesto published by the Wall StreetJournal.andP;  But Unisys couldn't have happened without standards.andP;  Even morethan the Unix standard, OSI networking provides a way to interlink in astandard way Unisys's key architectures: the Burroughs A Series processorsand Burroughs Network Architecture (BNA), the Sperry 1100/2200 processors andDistributed Communications Architecture (DCA), Convergent Technology'sBTOS/CTOS, and U Series Unix processors.andP;  Without OSI, the name Unisys ispure hype.andM;Standards have always been at the heart of Unisys's technology strategy.andP;  Butits marketing strategy has been a different story.andP;  Unisys hasn't yet comeout and said that OSI and other open standards are the wellspring of acohesive corporate architecture.andP;  There is no corporate architecture, whichis the source of some confusion among customers.andM;CASTING THE DIE WITH OSI.andP;  Unisys hasn't announced a new open-systemscorporate architecture (or &quot;market-tecture,&quot; as the case may be) for fearthat it would scare off Burroughs, Sperry, and Convergent Technologiescustomers made skittish by three corporate reorganizations in as many years.andO;To reassure these customers, Unisys has talked as much about investmentprotection as it has about standards.andM;Now, however, Unisys is close to completing a base of OSI network servicesthat protects customers' proprietary systems while laying down a migrationpath to an open systems future.andM;The OSI base comprises five products: X.400 Message Handling Service (MHS);File Transfer, Access, and Management (FTAM) services; program-to-programcommunications based on Association Control and Service Elements (ACSE); andOSI transport services supporting Etherne (8802/3) LANs and X.25 wide areanetworks.andP;  This base level of services has been implemented on every keyUnisys architecture except the A Series mainframes.andP;  The A Series will getthe package in the first quarter of 1991.andM;Now that Unisys is close to completing its networking foundation, it isformulating an OSI-based corporate architecture, which company officials havecalled &quot;The Enterprise Model&quot; in customer presentations.andP;  The EnterpriseModel is to Unisys what SAA is to IBM.andP;  It places Unisys's diversearchitectures and products into a unified environmental perspective anddefines the bases for including or not including particular products withinit.andM;THE ENTERPRISE MODEL.andP;  Unisys's Enterprise Model has five components: SystemsConnectivity, Distributed Systems, Information Management, SolutionsGeneration, and Systems Management.andP;  (See Illustration 1.)andM;Systems Connectivity Services.andP;  Systems Connectivity Services provide theunderlying LAN, WAN, and messaging communications infrastructure fordistributed systems services.andP;  The strategic Unisys products will support ISO8802/3 (Ethernet-CSMA/CD) LANs, X.25 WANs, and Fiber Distributed DataInterconnect (FDDI) as a high-speed LAN interconnect mechanism.andP;  Unisys willinclude BNA, DCA, and BTOS within this layer, but will encourage users tomigrate to OSI.andP;  In the long term, OSI solutions will eclipse the proprietaryarchitectures in importance.andM;Distributed Systems Services.andP;  Distributed Systems Services (DSS) support thedistribution of data and processing capabilities on large networks,independent of transport mechanisms.andP;  Unisys's goal with DSS is to allowusers to develop and deploy applications without requiring knowledge of theunderlying protocols.andP;  Users address Distributed Systems Services viaapplications or standard software, such as the OFIS software system and itsSolution Generation Languages (SGLs), Linc II (a computer-aided softwareengineering, or CASE toolset), Mapper (a fourth-generation language, or 4GL),and Ally (a database application development tool).andP;  The strategic pieces ofDSS are X.400 MHS, Distributed Transaction Processing, and Remote SQL Access.andM;Information Management Services.andP;  Information Management Services address howdata is managed and accessed, and access to SQL data is the basis for aproduct's inclusion in this layer.andP;  Among Unisys's current products, theSperry-architecture RDMS 1100 and a number of third-party relationalDBMSs--Oracle and Informix among them--satisfy this requirement.andP;  Unisys isadding SQL access to the Semantic Information Manager (SIM) it tells with theInformation Executive product for the A Series.andP;  SIM is an advanced product:It allows relationships between data and their functions to be defined in theDMS II flat-file database.andP;  By another name, SIM is an object-orienteddatabase.andP;  SIM and the InfoExec product are strategic to Unisys, yet thecompany has been quite about the existence of this product.andM;Solutions Generation.andP;  The Solutions Generation Layer of the architectureprovides a consistent user interface and development/execution environmentacross a range of operating systems.andP;  The strategic components arePresentation Manager for the common user interface and Linc II and Mapperamong the tools.andP;  Unisys will implement the look and feel of PresentationManager across its major platforms and workstations, including DOS.andP;  Amongthe SGLs, Linc II and Mapper will be implemented across the full spectrum ofarchitectures.andP;  Ally is also important, but Unisys positions it as a productof Unix, BTOS, DOS, and OS/2 workstations, not the full product line.andP;  Unisysanticipates adding a range of tools under the banner of systems generation,including software aimed at end users and system administrators, as well asprofessional developers.andM;System Management Services.andP;  System Management Services (SMS) providesadministrative, security and authentication services needed to implement adistributed computing environment.andP;  Unisys has begun development on two ofthe strategic products in this layer: X.500 Directory Services and NetworkManagement Services.andP;  Security management services and applicationconfiguration management services are other targets.andM;OSI Networking,andM;Today and TomorrowandM;OSI provides the networking foundation of Unisys's Enterprise Model.andP;  Unisysstructures its OSI product strategy into content releases.andP;  The initialcontent release provides what Unisys believes to be the minimum customersexpect from a vendor.andP;  It also provides gateways among OSI and TCP/IP, BNA,DCA, and BTOS.andP;  The initial content release is based on the 1984 OSIstandards; Unisys is developing 1988 versions of its Initial Content Releasebeginning with the U Series this year.andP;  (See Illustration 2.)andM;Unisys's Initial Content Release for OSI includes:andM;CCITT X.400 MHS.andP;  MHS provides the basis for a store-and-forward messagingsystem.andP;  Unisys has implemented the 1984 standard as the native mail systemof its diverse architectures, following the profiles of the NationalInstitute of Standards and Technology's Implementors Agreement and theCommission of European Communities.andM;FTAM.andP;  FTAM provides the basis for transferring files--in whole or inpart--from one system to another.andM;PROGRAM-TO-PROGRAM COMMUNICATIONS.andP;  Within the session software it isproviding for its diverse architectures, Unisys supports OSI-basedprogram-to-program communications support, primarily ACSE, but also RemoteOperations and Service Elements (ROSE).andP;  These provide a facility that allowsa local application to establish a connection with a remote program toexchange data.andM;OSI TRANSPORTS.andP;  Unisys supports X.25 and 8802.3 (Ethernet).andM;FUTURE CONTENT RELEASES.andP;  Subsequent content releases, beginning this spring,will begin to flesh out the company's OSI infrastructure.andM;X.500 Directory Services.andP;  Currently, Unisys's OSI systems maintain smalllocal directories to store configuration and user information.andP;  This is astopgap measure that will be supplanted by an X.500 directory serviceavailable on all platforms.andP;  X.500 will give Unisys a single messaging anddirectory service--that conforms to international standards--to unify itsvarious platforms, extending the reach of electronic mail users beyond theirlocal systems.andM;X.500 directory services are a significant capability.andP;  Unisys plans to rollout its first X.500 software this year.andP;  Depending on the timing of itsannouncements, Unisys may be one of the first among its competitors to pulloff an entrance into X.500.andM;CMIS Network Management.andP;  The network management infrastructures of BNA, DCA,and BTOS provide basic administrative functions to system operators.andP;  Unisysintends to provide new management features using the OSI Common ManagementInformation Services (CMIS) specification, and its associated protocol, CMIP(Common Management Information Protocol).andP;  Unisys is working on a managementinfrastructure for DCA that can be extended to serve BNA, BTOS, and Unixnetworks later.andP;  Because it is based on CMIS/CMIP, the new network managementsystem will be able to send information about the networks it manages to theCMIS systems being developed by Digital, Sun Microsystems, ATandamp;T,Hewlett-Packard, and others.andM;Unisys recently adopted ATandamp;T's Accumaster Integrator as an integrated neworkmanagement solution.andP;  But this move is strictly tactical.andP;  Unisys ispromising integration capabilities within its new CMIS-based systems.andP;  Thisis a play for customers that don't buy into ATandamp;T's Accumaster Integrator.andO;Unisys supports the three-tiered structure employed by the AccumasterIntegrator, but is keeping its options open as a provider of integrationplatforms.andM;Electronic Data Interchange.andP;  Unisys offers Easy Access Data Interchange(EaDI) today, but it is a tactical product specific to U Series processors.andO;EaDI provides a single EDI format and conversion, data-table extraction, andinsertion routines that bridge proprietary data formats.andP;  Unisys plans tobring EaDI into its OSI architecture by integrating it with X.400 MHS.andM;Office Document Architecture.andP;  Office Document Architecture (ODA), with itsOffice Document Interchange Format (ODIF), is the basis for Unisysdevelopment projects in imaging and document/object management.andP;  Unisys isworking on a Document Management System (DMS) that uses ODA to supportcompound and multimedia documents in an object-oriented applicationsenvironment similar to Hewlett-Packard's New Wave.andP;  DMS is being developed ona Unix server platform with an interface to DOS PCs and DOS applications.andM;Security.andP;  Unisys hopes to build on the work of its Unisys Government SystemsDivision is defining security and authentication services.andP;  Unisys obtained aNational Computer Security Council B1 security rating for the 1100/2200processors.andP;  This work will be leveraged as services available across the ASeries and U Series.andM;Virtual Terminal Protocol and Job Distribution Services.andP;  Currently, Unisysprovides proprietary virtual terminal protocol (VTP) and remote job entryprotocol that give users cross-architecture access and remote access.andP;  Unisyswill supplant these proprietary protocols with the OSI-standard VTP and JobDistribution Services.andM;Distributed Transaction Processing.andP;  Eighty percent of A Series of 1100/2200mainframes are engaged in transaction processing applications, which is whyUnisys has launced a transaction processing initiative.andP;  The initiative seeksto develop distributed transaction services based on X/Open's OLTP model andthe International Standards Organization's (ISO's) Distributed TransactionProcessing (DTP) standards (DIS 10026).andP;  The two models will eventuallyconverge, but, for the moment, X/Open's standard is aimed at Unix systems.andO;Unisys plans to implement X/Open's model on the U Series this year, migratingit to compliance with ISO's DTP standard.andP;  On the A Series, 1100/2200, andBTOS, Unisys will go directly to the ISO DTP standards.andM;The X/Open architecture defines Transaction Managers that coordinatetransactions between Resource Managers, which are distributed applicationsand databases.andP;  In this context, Unisys's proprietary transaction processingsystems--Extended Transaction Processing Architecture (XTPA) on the1100/2200, and COMS and DMS II on the A Series--Are accessible forcooperative processing in an OLTP environment.andP;  Long term, however, both theU Series and the proprietary transaction managers will migrate to the OSI DTPstandard.andM;Open Distributed Processing.andP;  Developers working on distributed processing atUnisys acknowledge that they'll need a remote procedure call (RPC) and otherdistributed processing services.andP;  RPC is the immediate issue.andP;  Unisys appearsdisposed to adopt Sun Microsystems' RPC/XDR (External Data Representationformat).andP;  The company sells RPC/XDR on its U Series 6000 processors.andP;  And itoffers the Netwise RPC along with the Novell NetWare LANs it resells.andP;  Giventhat Netwise and Sun recently joined forces, the case appears closed.andP;  Unisysdoes not sell Hewlett-Packard/Apollo's Network Computing System (NCS), themajor RPC competitor to the Sun RPC.andM;In reality, however, Unisys is undecided on the RPC issue.andP;  The company islikely to wait and adopt the ISO's Open Distributed Processing standard whenit emerges.andP;  Distributed Processing developers are wary of choosing betweenSun and HP/Apollo; they'd rather wait for consensus.andP;  They're watching theOpen Software Foundation's effort to identify an RPC mechanism as part of itsDistributed Computing Environment initiative.andP;  If the OSF's process generatesan RPC solution with broad backing.andP;  Unisys is likely to adopt it, as it didwith OSF's Motif user interface standard.andM;Distributed Processing developers also aren't satisfied that any of thecurrent RPC mechanisms gives them enough of the distributed processingfunction they require.andP;  The issue is the diverse methods used to accomplishdistributed processing.andP;  RPCs are one mechanism, state-oriented protocols areanother, and both have their limitations.andP;  RPCs work best in synchronousoperations, but are less suited for asynchronous interactions.andP;  The result isthat achieving a general purpose platform requires more than one remoteprocessing mechanism, making applications development complex.andM;Last year, in a research paper published by the Association of ComputingMachinery, the Unisys's Network and Information Security Division proposed anaugmented RPC mechanism called Remote Execution with During Construct (REXDC)that seeks to overcome some of the current limitations.andP;  REXDC includes amessaging system similar to the one used in the Mach Unix variant that cansupport asynchronous as well as synchronous remote procedure calls.andP;  Inaddition, REXDC provides a message-buffering mechanism that seeks to overcomethe one-system-to-one-system operations supported by today's RPCs.andP;  REXDCsupports one-to-one, one-to-may, many-to-one, and many-to-many interactions.andO;The researchers hoped their ideas would stimulate development of a moreconsistent and robust remote procedure facility than exists today.andM;The ACM research paper indicates the issues that are driving Unisys's DTPdevelopment and participation in standards definition.andP;  Unisys is active inthis area, holding the vice chair of X/Open's XTP group and the chair of theIEEE 1003.11 Subcommittee on Transaction Processing.andP;  In the meantime, Unisyswill continue to offer the Sun ONC and Netwise RPCs as tactical solutions tocustomers who want to use them.andM;Implementation IronyandM;Unisys is proud of its record in implementing OSI.andP;  It had the first OSIproduct set available worldwide--two years ago.andP;  The company is moving tomake OSI a reality for its customers.andM;The scope of Unisys's Initial Content Release is a letdown.andP;  Can't Unisysimplement more OSI networking support faster?andM;The irony of Unisys's situation is that, even though implementation basiccommon services across its various platforms is a hard problem, the responsein some quarters is, &quot;Ho hum.&quot;andP;  On the surface, DCA, BNA, and BTOS aresimilar.andP;  Each is built on a peer-to-peer model that supports limiteddistributed computing functions.andP;  But the actual protocol structures are verydifferent, with Sperry's DCA and BTOS with its BNet closer in structure toOSI than BNA.andP;  Implementing OSI on the Unix-based U Series is no problem atall.andP;  The result of this situation is that U Series, DCA, and BTOS/BNet usersare ahead of BNA users in getting OSI software.andP;  However, all of thearchitectures implement TCP/IP as an interim step toward OSI.andM;Unisys is implementing the OSI session and transport layers as a mask betweencurrent applications based on proprietary networks and the underlying networktransports.andP;  This is an important migration benefit for current users:They'll be able to keep their existing networks and applications, and phasein OSI at either level at their leisure to take advantage of an expandingrepertoire of application services and System Generation Tools.andP;  Unisys's OSIimplementations support proprietary applications on OSI transports and viceversa.andP;  The migration paths for BNA and DCA are shown in Illustrations 4 and5.andM;Each of the proprietary architectures provides a new set of challenges, whichUnisys is dealing with in different ways.andM;DCA and OSI.andP;  DCA was written as a seven-layer stack of communicationsservices in 1976, and aligned with the OSI model in 1982.andP;  (See Illustration6.)andP;  For this reason, sliding OSI protocols under the DCA proprietarynetworking and applications services has been straightforward for Unisys.andO;The networking architecture is implemented in the 1100/2200 mainframe seriesDistributed Communications Processor (DCP) front end running Telconcommunications software.andP;  Applications and application services are executedon the mainframe, while communications functions are executed in the DCP.andO;This is an inherently distributable architecture that matches the OSI model,and masks communications software changes from applications.andM;The key to the DCA OSI implementation is a general application systeminterface called Distributed Data Processing-Program-to-ProgramCommunications (DDP-PPC).andP;  DDP-PPC was built by Sperry to allowprogram-to-program communications among 1100 hosts, 1100s and Unixprocessors, and 1100s and PCs.andP;  DDP-PPC provides session services, and,because it is a generalized software layer, Unisys can add to it support forOSI protocols alongside its proprietary services.andP;  Unisys has added TCP/IPand SNA supports to DCA in the same fashion.andP;  (See Illustration 7.)andM;Starting from the bottom layers, Unisys has implemented support for 8802/3LANs and X.25 wide area networks within the DCP's Telcon software.andP;  The8802/3 support is implemented in a DCP LAN platform, which implementsEthernet support within the DCP Telcon software for general applications, andwithin a special Host LAN Controller that allows channel attachment of1100/2200s for high-speed, host-host file operations.andM;Support for the OSI Connection-Oriented Session Protocol (ISO 8326/8327) isimplemented in the aforementioned DDP-PPC.andP;  OSI MHS is implemented as anative mail system on the 1100/2200, with gateways to Unisys's proprietaryOFIS Link mail system.andP;  Unisys has implemented support for FTAM as a nativealternative to its proprietary DDP-FJT protocol and ACSE program-programcommunications alongside DCA's own IPC capability.andM;BNA and OSI.andP;  Burroughs Network Architecture (BNA) has trailed behind DCA inOSI implementations by more than a year because it doesn't map well to theOSI model.andP;  BNA does not have a general session layer that Unisys can use toimplement new protocols.andP;  Rather, Unisys must implement TCP/IP, OSI, and SNAsupport on BNA networks as separate session-interface modules.andP;  This takestime, which is why Unisys's Initial Content Release functions won't be readyfor BNA customers until after completion of field tests, which began in thefirst quarter of 1990 and are scheduled for completion in the first quarterof 1991.andP;  (See Illustration 8.)andM;When the OSI services are available for BNA, users of that architecture willhave the same opportunities to run proprietary application level servicesover a variety of transports as do DCA users.andM;BNA functions are implemented in Unisys's CP2000 communications processors.andO;As with the 1100/2200, communications functions reside in the communicationscontroller, while applications services generally excute on BNA hosts.andM;OSI on BNA neworks involves 8802/3 LAN connections via the CP2000'sCommunications Processor LAN (CPLAN) interface.andP;  CP2000 already supports X.25connections.andP;  The session layer, once again, will be ISO 8326/8327.andP;  As withDCA OSI, X.400 MHS, FTAM, and ACSE will be implemented as native capabilitieson BNA hosts, with gateways to OFIS Link.andM;BTOS and OSI.andP;  BTOS has always had a healthy complement of interconnectioncapabilities that allowed users to run Bnet, its networking software, withBNA, DCA, and IBM SNA.andP;  These interconnection modules allow BTOS workstationslinked in BNet &quot;clusters&quot; (the equivalent of client-server LANs) toparticiapte as peers in foreign networks, and to support distributedapplications in those environments as well as in BTOS/BNet networks.andM;To achieve transport independence for BTOS applications, Unisys NetworkComputing Group, which overseas BTOS, last year implemented ISO 8326/8327 innew OSI Session software and a new applications-layer version of BNet--BNetII--that better supports OSI transports.andP;  BNetII implements support for OSIprotocols from the session layer to the physical layer, giving Unisys thetransport independence it needs.andP;  This transport independence is implementedtoday for DCA, SNA, S.25, and 8802/3 and 8802/5 (Token-Ring).andP;  Unisys NCGhasn't written session-to-transport interfaces for BNA or TCP/IP, but this isa matter of time.andP;  (See Illustration 9.)andM;In addition to the OSI session and transport layers in BTOS OSI, Unisys alsohas implemented support for X.400 MHS, FTAM, and ACSE on its proprietaryworkstation networking platform, with a gateway to its proprietary OFIS Mail,called OFIS Access-X.400.andM;U SERIES and OSI.andP;  Unisys implemented its OSI initial Content Release on itsU Series processors starting two years ago.andP;  All U Series boxes support X.400MHS, FTAM, OSI session and transport protocols, and X.25 and Ethernettransports.andP;  Each includes an additional gateway to the UUCP mail service.andM;Unisys's U Series is in a state of transition that will be reflected in howand whether the future content releases are implemented on all models in theline.andP;  The corporate emphasis in implementing X.500 directory services anddistributed transaction processing services will be on the U 6000 machines,which include single-processor models manufactured internally by the formerConvergent Technolgoies operation, and multiple processor models manufacturedby Sequent Computer Systems.andP;  The older U Series 5000 and 7000 models willget additional OSI services later--if customers seem to want them at all.andM;At press time, Unisys was formulating its strategy for introducing RISC-baseddesigns to its U Series line.andP;  The company is expected to use Motorola's 8800RISC design as upgrades for the current Convergent S Series.andP;  Each new modelbased on RISC will get OSI-based services along with the U Series 6000 boxes.andM;WHAT'S GOOD ABOUT UNISYS OSI.andP;  Despite all the challenges, Unisys hasachieved its goal with OSI: It has implemented a consistent base of servicesacross its major platforms.andP;  Only Hewlett-Packard among the major systemsvendors has accomplished as much with OSI networking as quickly.andM;Looking to the future, Unisys has two things going for it in its OSI work:testing commitment and application services.andM;Testing Commitment.andP;  Unisys has a serious commitment to testing, both forcompliance with standards and for interoperability of its implementationswith those of others.andP;  Unisys is one of the most active users of OSINet, andis an active member of the Corporation for Open Systems (COS), the UnitedStates' primary OSI testing-definition body.andP;  At press time, Unisys had, forexample, verified the interoperability of its DCA and BTOS X.400 MHS softwarewith some two dozen other implementations.andP;  BTOS Unisys's contribution to theInterOp '89 trade show was evidence of how far the company's capability hasprogressed.andP;  (See Illustration 3.)andM;Applications Services.andP;  Having fixed the plumbing by addressing the lower OSInetworking layers, Unisys can begin to introduce more exciting applicationsserevices to its repertoire.andM;Family FeudsandM;Unisys's marketing slogan, &quot;The Power of 2,&quot; implies unity.andP;  Unisys has beenworking for two years to build a consistent networking platform to make thisunity a reality.andP;  These efforts continued when Convergent was added to thecorporate mix, raising the ante, in effect, to &quot;The Power of 3.&quot;andM;In spite of these efforts to achieve unity, Unisys remains a company drivenby diverse product lines, most of them proprietary in nature and each withits own set of customers and interests.andM;With its open networking infrastructure in place, Unisys has begun tellingits mainframe customers to stabilize their systems as &quot;Information Hubs,&quot; ordata repositories.andP;  New applications should be located on servers--smallmainframes and BTOS in the short run; the US Series in the long run.andP;  (SeeIllustration 10.)andP;  At the bottom tier of this architecture, either BTOS orPCs give the user a window into the entire network.andM;But beneath this strategy, a very real struggle is going on within Unisys.andO;You hear it in the doubts expressed by insiders that Unisys's OSI productswill produce immediate revenue gains.andP;  You see it in the way Unisys hasorganized its product management, sales, and marketing functions.andP;  Productdevelopment remains centered on product lines, as opposed to vertical marketsor another cross-functional model.andP;  Meanwhile, sales is a unified function.andO;Unisys got into open systems well before open systems became a big business.andO;Until OSI starts catching on with users, Unisys will struggle to find a wayto generate revenue from continued proprietary sales while convincing usersto migrate from those architectures to open systems.andM;FAVORITE SONS.andP;  Within all the diversity of Unisys's product catalogue,certain proprietary systems remain favorite sons.andP;  The place where this ismost obvious is at the low end of Unisys's product line.andP;  Unisys sells BTOS.andO;Unisys sells PCs as Personal Workstations.andP;  Unisys resells Novell NetWare.andO;Unisys sells low-end Unix boxes with TCP/IP networking.andP;  And it will soonbegin selling LAN Manager, supporting DOS and OS/2.andM;Of all these networking products, which are opportunistic, and which arestrategic?andP;  The telling factor is Unisys's investment in integration of itsLANs and it other computing architectures and its commitment to move to LANManager.andP;  The four platforms appear to shake out as follows:andM;NetWare.andP;  NetWare is in the product line to satisfy specific customerrequests.andP;  Unisys has not committed to integration of NetWare with its otherproducts, other than through third-party TCP/IP products.andM;TCP/IP.andP;  Unisys has clearly stated that TCP/IP is an interim networkingstandard whose primary benefit is the migration path it affords to OSI.andM;BTOS.andP;  The lion's share of Unisys's current investment in LAN integration isgoing into BTOS.andP;  Emphasizing BTOS is a risk that Unisys appears tounderstand well.andP;  BTOS is a good architecture that Unisys has soldsuccessfully against minicomputers for years.andP;  BTOS has been extended toaccommodate everwidening interconnection and interoperability requirements,from PCs to LU6.2 to OSI.andP;  However, BTOS's target of opportunity is shiftingas PC LANs like NetWare and LAN Manager--not minicomputers--become viewed asthe most important midrange applications platform of the '90s.andM;At one time, BTOS's advantages over mincomputers in cost and performance weremanifest, but they're not so obvious in comparisons with NetWare and LANManager.andP;  To compete in this changing market, Unisys will have to allow thepowerful new applications written for LAN Manager in particular to run onBTOS.andP;  This is Unisys's intention, but it's an indirect way to capitalize onnew software.andM;LAN Manager.andP;  Unisys will sell LAN Manager 2.0 when that platform becomesavailable later this year.andP;  Unisys plans to sell LAN Manager for Unix (LM/X)as well as LAN Manager for OS/2, capitalizing on the integrationopportunities afforded by the Unix implementation.andP;  The company is clearlytargeting LAN Manager as its &quot;next generation&quot; LAN platform, even if ithasn't come out and said so.andM;The current situation is a muddle of choices or an embarrassment of riches,depending on your point of view.andP;  Unisys finds itself needing to assurediverse groups of customers that it won't abandon them while still making itclear that one LAN platform is the choice for the future.andP;  We expect Unisysto address this question in its strategy announcement based on The EnterpriseModel.andP;  And we expect LAN Manager to play the leading role in the future.andM;The Trojan Horse QuestionandM;Unisys's goal is to sell into foreign environments by promising painlessconnectivity and cost efficiency.andP;  Having seeded a foreign network, Unisysthen hopes to use its Solution Generation Languages to convince the customerwith to buy more.andP;  This is truly a Trojan Horse strategy.andM;Unisys's cost-efficiency position hasn't kept up with the expanding range ofhigh-power, low-cost RISC platform options.andP;  And Linc II, Mapper, and Ally,the current SGLs, won't be exciting to a broad base of users, particularlyend users.andM;The hazard on this particular course are considerable.andP;  First, keeping pacewith the Unix price/performance race is difficult, as IBM just reminded theindustry with its RS/6000 platform.andP;  Keeping pace with performance is evenmore vital in Unisys's case because the company does not have the goodreputation for service and support of an HP or an IBM to fall back on.andM;The more difficult dimension of the problem is keeping the promise offantastic applications-building tools that is implied in the strategy.andP;  Whatif Linc II, Mapper, and Ally aren't exciting enough to entice a broader baseof users?andP;  In that case, Unisys's Trojan Horse would be empty, and thecompany would be stuck as a commodity-box seller.andM;SYSTEM GENERATION TOOLS.andP;  Linc II and Mapper, in particular, are mature,robust tools that complement one another.andP;  Unisys has been cross-porting them(Linc II to the 1100/2200, and Mapper to the A Series), and inends to portthem to BTOS, the U Series, and third-party Unix flavors like IBM's AIX aswell.andP;  Indeed, Mapper has already been ported to BTOS, the U Series, andMS-DOS.andP;  This is sound strategy.andP;  It will result in a toolset that canoperate across platforms, a powerful inducement to users.andP;  As Unisys expandsthe range of open transaction services, these products will be even morevaluable.andM;Ally, which Unisys acquired during the mid-1980s, is a system-developmenttool aimed at low- to medium-volume transaction Unix, OS/2, BTOS, and DOSapplications.andP;  Unisys plans to port Ally to other non-Unisys Unix flavors,including AIX, this year.andM;Positioning.andP;  Unisys positions Linc II, Mapper, and Ally as complementarytools.andP;  (See Illustration 11.)andP;  Linc II is a computer-aided softwareengineering (CASE) environment for generating production, transaction-basedapplications.andP;  Mapper is a tool that enables end users to query and report onproduction data.andP;  Ally is a CASE tool aimed at Unix, BTOS, OS/2, and DOSworkstation users.andM;Linc II.andP;  Linc II is the latest version of what is arguably the best-sellingCASE tool on the market.andP;  Linc was developed by Burroughs as a 4GL forgenerating (and regenerating) production systems and networks, and has grownto become a full CASE environment.andP;  The Linc Systems Approach methodology isa pragmatic way to model systems by dealing with business elements ratherthan technical arcana.andP;  And Linc II accommodates a variety ofthird-generation languages (3GLs).andP;  Unisys reports over 3,000 licensees.andM;Mapper.andP;  Mapper, meanwhile, is a 4GL aimed at providing users withdecision-support and reporting capabilities.andP;  It operates on Linc II-definedsystems and on other data structures as well.andP;  And, although Unisys positionsMapper as an end-user tool, it is not a lightweight language.andP;  Unisys wroteits internal electronic mail system with Mapper.andM;The positioning and strategy of Linc II, Mapper, and Ally are sound, and thetools themselves have proven capabilities.andP;  But are they equal to thechallenge?andP;  When Unisys wheels in its Trojan Horse, will the forces hiddeninside it be strong enough to carry the day?andM;KEEPING PACE WITH GUI AND OBJECTS.andP;  The leading edge of applications tools atall levels is object-oriented development and visual interfaces.andP;  Tools aimedat professional developers (CASE) are moving in this direction, as in themushrooming number of end-user programming tools.andM;Unisys is taking Linc II, Mapper, and Ally in this direction.andP;  Last year,Unisys added the Linc Design Assistant (LDA), a graphical front end to LincII based on the SmallTalk object-oriented language and environment.andP;  Thisspring, all of the tools are scheduled to get Presentation Manager-basedinterfaces.andP;  And Unisys has begun working on reimplementations of its toolsin the C++ object-oriented language, which will improve their flexibility andextendability to new data types and functions.andM;Still, Mapper looks a bit long in the tooth.andP;  Mapper's user interface is theclassic command-intensive, text-based 4GL approach that most end users gaveup on long ago.andP;  Replicating this interface in Presentation Manager alonewon't make Mapper the generalized end-user Unisys needs it to be.andP;  What'sneeded in Mapper is an icon-based interface fronting for software modulesthat users can plug together to do specific tasks.andP;  The best of the newvisual programming tools already deliver this level of capability, and moreare on the way.andM;The fact that Linc II got a graphical interface before Mapper did is ironic.andO;The biggest payoff for graphical front ends is with users, not developers.andM;SOFTWARE-HARDWARE SEPARATION.andP;  Unisys doesn't manage the Linc II, Mapper, andAlly products in a standalone software operation.andP;  Rather, these products arepart of a linked hardware-software management effort.andP;  The risk of such alinkage is in coloring the corporate view of what constitutes good marketperformance by the software products.andP;  If Linc II, Mapper, and Ally arejudged successes because they help Unisys sell boxes, they get lost in thestrategy.andM;Unisys is moving toward independent management of Linc II, Mapper, and Allyas it ports the tools to more platforms and adds interfaces between Linc IIand other CASE tools.andP;  Ultimately, the company should cut the cord betweenthe hardware and software operations.andP;  The issue for Unisys is how to manageLinc II, Mapper, and Ally for maximum market effectiveness.andP;  Unisys gains ifit ports them to a wide range of platforms, and it will get a large number ofports if it manages them as software products unlinked to Unisys hardware.andO;Managing them as part of the hardware strategy is more likely to retard portsoutside of the Unisys processor families.andM;Pragmatism versus InnovationandM;Evidence abounds that Unisys is genuinely committed to open systems.andP;  Inaddition to embracing Unix and OSI as its strategic technological foundation,the company has moved to open its proprietary systems.andM;In embracing standards, Unisys has hamstrung itself as an innovator.andO;Embracing standards alone is not good enough to make it in the world ofcommercial applications.andP;  Vendors also must invent new technology to solvecustomer problems.andM;Unisys is driven by pragmatism.andP;  Many of its customers are using proprietarysystems.andP;  Unisys is selling Unix hard as the future, but its proprietarycustomers still need standard interconnection/interoperability solutions.andO;Providing basic capabilities today across its various platforms and thenbuilding on that base is what Unisys is all about.andP;  The company is routinelyflogged by analysts and the press as a purveyor of boring technology.andP;  &quot;Riskaverse&quot; is a kinder description of Unisys.andM;Unisys's pragmatic approach has its benefits.andP;  Unisys does not have a deepaversion to reselling products made by other vendors.andP;  It has been apurchaser of technology for some time, and has chosen some goodpartners--among others, Arix, Sequent, and NCR for Unix boxes; Timeplex forwide-area networking products, Novell for LAN software; MArben for some ofits OSI transport, session, and FTAM software; and Sydney Development forsome of its X.400 MHS software.andM;Unisys also responds to reality.andP;  Even though it is a founder of UnixInternational (UI), for example, Unisys has adopted Presentation Manager andMotif as its graphical user interface standard.andP;  Motif is the product of UIarchrival Open Software Foundation, but it has gathered more momentum thanUI's alternative, Open Look.andM;The downside of Unisys's approach is that it is too practical.andP;  Users likedown-to-earth solutions based on standrds, but they're excited by a vision ofbetter things to come.andP;  Particularly in commercial computing, innovativetechnology is still valued as much as, if not more than, standardscompliance.andM;In networking, the emergence of distributed network computing as thefoundation for the interoperability of the 1990s is generating a lot ofinnovation on a range of fronts.andP;  The industry's big players are activelyworking to bring distributed computing environments (DCE) to fruition.andO;Digital and IBM have their own solutions; Sun is working a differentapproach; and IBM, Digital, HP, Microsoft, and others have collaborated on aDCE standards proposal to the Open Software Foundation.andM;Unisys is on the sidelines, waiting and watching for a standard to emergethat it can implement.andP;  To Unisys, distributed computing today means filetransfer and cross-connect terminal services.andP;  Meanwhile, IBM, Digital, andHewlett-Packard are working to deliver distributed computing environmentsthat deliver applications and services to diverse workstations, providing aninfrastructure to coordinate and safeguard users, data, and resources.andO;There's no equivalent Unisys vision of DCE.andP;  Consequently, the second orthird (depending on who's counting) largest U.S.andP;  computer vendor is not aforce in the most important distributed computing initiative of this decade.andM;There's evidence to suggest that a new spirit of invention has recently beenkindled Unisys, and that it is emanating from the former Convergentoperations.andP;  The Transaction Processing Initiative is ambitious.andP;  It is alsosomewhat risky, being based on early specifications from X/Open.andP;  Unisys isalso developing its own X.500 directory products--again, with early standardsspecifications.andM;Even so, Unisys must go much further than it has to balance pragmatism andinnovation.andP;  It often won't have to look far to find interesting newproducts.andP;  With the industry abuzz about the potential of FDDI as aninternetworking technology, Unisys failed to recognize the benefits ofcommercializing an FDDI Concentrator developed by its Defense SystemsDivision until late last year.andP;  And how many people in the industry know thatUnisys as a &quot;semantic database&quot; capable of supporting object-oriented datamodeling?andM;ConclusionsandM;Unisys's open systems strategy is sound.andP;  Execution of the strategy is wherethe company will succeed or fail to jumpstart its growth.andP;  When Unisys doessomething, it generally does a good job on the basic technology and thenfails to market it effectively.andP;  To get ahead, Unisys will have to focusincreasingly on executing its plans with sizzle and pizzazz.andM;Unisys will have to strike sparks in four major areas during the remainder of1990: RISC boxes, system-building tools, advanced application services, andPC LANs.andM;RISC PROCESSORS.andP;  We expect to see an announcement about RISC processorssoon.andP;  But just getting into the RISC market won't do enough for Unisys'sstanding as the largest Unix systems supplier.andP;  With IBM touting itssecond-generation RISC chip and the other majore players planning theirsecond generations during the next six to nine months, Unisys has to find away to get into a position of leadership and stay there.andM;SYSTEM-BUILDING TOOLS.andP;  Linc II, Mapper, and Ally are good basic tools.andP;  Butthere's a visual programming revolution going on that Unisys has only begunto tap into.andP;  Unisys understands the value of object-orientation, which is atthe root of visual programming.andP;  The company had the foresight to join theObject Management Group (Westboro, Massachusetts), an industry consortiumdefining a reference model and standards in object management.andP;  But thecompany needs to do tangible and exciting things with its understanding.andM;ADVANCED APPLICATION SERVICES.andP;  Unisys desperately needs innovativeapplication services to put some sizzle into its open systems strategy.andO;X.500 directory services are the immediate hope, with the TransactionProcessing Initiative looming in the background.andP;  The nascent DocumentManagement System may also be interesting, although its advantages overHewlett-Packard's competing NewWave environment aren't clear at this point.andM;PC LAN INTEGRATION.andP;  Even though users are placing more and more emphasis onPC LANs as workhorse applications platforms, Unisys's varied LAN productsdon't help it cash in on the trend.andP;  We expect Unisys to clean up its storyin this regard, giving users a clearer picture of how PC LANs fit into itsoverall architecture.andM;Unisys is entering the most critical year of its history.andP;  All of its workshould earn the company a second look from corporate America.andP;  Having reachedthis position, however, Unisys will have to deliver.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
