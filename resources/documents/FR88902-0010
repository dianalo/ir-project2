Metcalf, Senior StaffVeterinarian, Program Planning Staff, VS, APHIS, USDA, Room 841, FederalBuilding, 6505 Belcrest Road, Hyattsville, MD 20782, (301) 436-8713.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2><ITAG tagnum="84">Background</ITAG>The regulations in 9 CFR Part 78 (referred to below as the regulations)govern the interstate movement of cattle, bison, and swine in order toprevent the spread of brucellosis.On April 12, 1988, we published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> (53 FR 12019-12024, Docket Number 88-020) a documentproposing to amend andSection; 78.1 by adding the particle concentrationfluoresence immunoassay (PCFIA) test to the list of official tests forbrucellosis in cattle and bison. In our proposal, we included portionsof the procedures for conducting the PCFIA test. We invited the submissionof written comments, which were required to be postmarked or received onor before May 12, 1988. We received nine comments_two from private individuals,one from the American Veterinary Medical Association, one from the HolsteinAssociation, and five from state agencies responsible for animal health.Four commenters favored the rule as published.Three commenters favored adoption of the PCFIA test as an official test,but objected to our including test procedures. One commenter objected toinclusion of the procedures, without favoring or opposing adoption of thetest. In response to these comments, and based on our concerns with includingonly portions of the procedures in the regulations, we are adding the PCFIAtest to the list of official tests without including the portions of theprocedures for carrying out the test. We are, however, considering inclusionof the protocol for the PCFIA test and other official tests in a testingmanual for incorporation by reference or inclusion in the regulations.One commenter supported adoption of the PCFIA test as an official test,but disagreed with our statement in the backgound information of the proposalthat the test could stand alone as a diagnostic test. The commenter statedthat supplemental tests would be necessary in most cases, particularlyin vaccinated populations. According the the commenter, the specificityof the PCFIA test when used for cattle that have received an adult vaccinationwithin the previous year is inferior to the manual complement-fixation(CF) test in the range of S/N ratios (the ratio of sample or positive controlto control signal) proposed to indicate a reactor (andgreater;.25).We are making no changes based on this comment. The data supplied by thedeveloper of the test showed no statistical difference in specificity andsensitivity between the PCFIA and CF tests for samples testing positive.Although running two or more types of tests concurrently might providean increased combined sensitivity, the increase with regard to the PCFIAwould likely be slight.The same commenter expressed concern regarding how the test would be interpreted,stating that because control samples don't usually reveal fluctuationsin the test's sensitivity, professional experience is sometimes necessaryto make an appropriate diagnosis. We are making no changes based on thiscomment. The designated epidemiologist (an epidemiologist selected by thestate animal health official and the Veterinarian in Charge to performthe functions required) has the authority to supplement the results ofthe test with considerations regarding the individual animal, herd history,and other epidemiologic factors when determining the brucellosis classificationof cattle and bison.One of the commenters favoring adoption of the PCFIA test as an officialtest expressed concern that the cost of the test might be prohibitive.According to the commenter, the cost of the required instrumentation andreagents would probably limit the use of the test to one central laboratory.We are making no changes based on this comment. Our inclusion of the PCFIAtest as an official test is based on its efficacy as a diagnostic tool.If it proves to be prohibitively expensive, other official tests will stillbe available for use. As we stated in the proposed rule, it is expectedthat lower personnel expenses due to the increased speed and automationof the test will offset the start-up and recurring costs.Based on the rationale set forth in the proposal and in this document,we are adopting the provisions of the proposal as a final rule, with thechanges noted. Additionally, we are including the PCFIA test in the listof official tests at andSection; 78.1(a)(10) of the regulations, rather thanat andSection; 78.1(a)(9) as proposed. This change is necessary because anothertest was added at andSection; 78.1(a)(9) between the time the April 12 proposedrule was published and publication of this final rule. We are also redesignatingandSection; 78.1(a)(10) of the current regulations as andSection; 78.1(a)(11).<ITAG tagnum="84">Executive Order 12291 and Regulatory Flexibility Act</ITAG>We are issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12291, andwe have determined that it is not a ``major rule.'' Based on informationcompiled by the Department, we have determined that this rule will havean effect on the economy of less than $100 million; will not cause a majorincrease in costs or prices for consumers, individual industries, federal,state, or local government agencies, or geographic regions; and will notcause a significant adverse effect on competition, employment, investment,productivity, innovation, or on the ability of United States-based enterprisesto compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or export markets.For this action, the Office of Management and Budget has waived its reviewprocess required by Executive Order 12291.This action will only provide an additional official brucellosis test forcattle and bison as an option for use in determining whether an animalis infected with the disease. The testing requirements for brucellosiswill not change. Moreover, use of the PCFIA test will not affect the marketprice of the animals tested. Although more rapid testing may allow fastermarketing, the economic effect on owners of cattle or bison will not besignificant. Nor will the inclusion of the PCFIA test as an official testhave a significant economic effect on laboratories. Although the cost ofthis test may be more than that for other official tests, due to the needfor new equipment and to higher reagent costs, lower personnel expensesdue to the increased speed and automation of the test are expected to offsetthe start-up and recurring costs. Other official tests will still be availableto those laboratories where the PCFIA test is not used.Under these circumstances, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant HealthInspection Service has determined that this action will not have a significanteconomic impact on a substantial number of small entities. <ITAG tagnum="84">Paperwork Reduction Act</ITAG>This rule contains no information collection or recordkeeping requirementsunder the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 <T3>et seq.</T3>).<ITAG tagnum="84">Executive Order 12372</ITAG>This program/activity is listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistanceunder No. 10.025 and is subject to Executive Order 12372, which requiresintergovernmental consultation with state and local officials. (See 7 CFRPart 3015, Subpart V.)<ITAG tagnum="84">Effective Date</ITAG>The Administrator, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, has determinedthat this rulemaking proceeding should be expedited by making it effectiveupon publication. Inclusion of the PCFIA test as an official test for brucellosisin cattle and bison will allow those laboratories that choose to use thetest to conduct testing that is faster, more sensitive, and more specificthan many of the official laboratory tests currently being used. Some laboratoriesalready have the equipment necessary to conduct the PCFIA test, are currentlyusing the test with regard to intrastate movement of cattle, and couldbegin using the test for interstate movement without purchasing new equipment.Delaying the effective date of this rule would create an unnecessary delayin the use of the PCFIA test.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 9 CFR Part 78</ITAG>Animal diseases, Brucellosis, Cattle, Hogs, Quarantine, Transportation.<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 78_BRUCELLOSIS</ITAG>Accordingly, 9 CFR Part 78 is amended as follows:1.
