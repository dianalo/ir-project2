Paul Simon and Jesse Jackson.   The Tribune endorsement in Sunday editions called Gore ``anunderdog with sound judgment and an important message.''   The Chicago Sun-Times, the state's second largest newspaperafter the Tribune, has endorsed Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakisin the Democratic race and Vice President George Bush in theRepublican primary.   ``The endorsement is offered in the same spirit as our earlierendorsement of Sen. Robert Dole in the Republican primary _ inhopes that an underdog with sound judgment and an important messagecan pick up momentum in Illinois and contest his party's nominationall the way to its convention,'' said the Tribune editorial.   The Tribune conducted a poll for Sunday's editions that showedSimon was favored by 35 percent of those surveyed, Jackson 30percent and Dukakis 18 percent. Gore and Gephardt had a combinedtotal of about 10 percent.   Among the likely Republican voters, Bush was supported by 62percent and Dole by 28 percent. Robertson was the first choice ofonly 6 percent.   The survey, conducted by Peter D. Hart Research Associates,contacted 504 Republicans and 501 Democrats on Wednesday andThursday and had a margin of error of 5 percentage points.   The Tribune endorsement said Gore was the only candidate whocould ``prevent the Democatic debate from winding down into thestaid pronouncements of ... Dukakis .... and the jazzier echo ofthe class-conscious Mr. Jackson.''   The Tribune gave Gore high marks on his knowledge of domesticand foreign affairs and also warned the Democratic Party it needed``a strong Gore candidacy just to avoid a repeat in November of its1980 and 1984 humiliations.''   Dukakis leads in the race for delegates to the party's nationalnominating convention, followed by Jackson and Gore. Missouri Rep.Richard Gephardt is fourth and Simon is last, although there aremore uncommitted delegates than Simon and Gephardt have together.</TEXT></DOC>
