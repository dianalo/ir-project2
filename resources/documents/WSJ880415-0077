Yesterday's market troubles convince many that the Fed will have to tighten policy before the November elections to protect the dollar and suppress inflation. &quot;We may be overloading some parts of our economy,&quot; says Georgia State University economist Donald Ratajczak. But higher rates in Reagan's final months as president could cast a cloud over Bush's election chances.    Treasury chief Baker, a Bush ally, seems confident of Fed Chairman Greenspan's ability to prevent a politically disastrous rate rise. Further increases this fall, however, could spark new administration pressures on the sometimes-divided Fed. Meanwhile, continued delay in filling the seventh Fed seat could lead the Democratic Senate to block any nominee so that the next president can fill the spot.    In a recent bank-merger vote, the board split 3-3 and then argued about whether the application had been approved or denied.    LITTLE CHANCE is seen for a new arms pact as debate rages over verification.    White House advisers now doubt that a U.S.-Soviet agreement on long-range missiles can be worked out soon. In internal bickering, hard-liners push on-site inspections on request, but some Pentagon officials worry about Soviet inspectors in U.S. defense plants. Others propose painting allowable missiles purple or other colors so they can be detected more easily.    Senate Intelligence Committee leaders worry that a new treaty in addition to the U.S.-Soviet pact on medium-range missiles will overtax U.S. ability to verify the accords. The panel will propose spending up to $10 billion on new spy satellites over the next five years. Indiana Sen. Quayle also frets that the medium-missile accord may block the U.S. from deploying futuristic conventional weapons.    REAGAN'S ROLE in the Bush campaign will be to woo target voter groups.    Strategists hope the president can transfer some of his past popularity with traditional Democratic voters, such as blue-collar workers and conservative white Southerners. Bush activists think Reagan can be especially helpful in Florida and California. They also will urge Reagan to help raise money for get-out-the-vote organizing.    Critics question how much enthusiasm the president can muster for Bush among hard-liners on the right. Reagan &quot;doesn't have the standing he had even two years ago with conservatives,&quot; claims conservative activist Paul Weyrich. Bush aides hope for a successful Reagan-Gorbachev summit in May that will allow the vice president to run with a peace legacy.    Some GOP activists grumble about the site of a Reagan speaking trip next week: Dukakis's home state of Massachusetts.    KOCH'S ENDORSEMENT of Gore gives the Tennessee senator a lift in the New York primary, especially among Jewish voters, but the boost may be marginal. The New York mayor has plenty of critics. Gore will probably still have trouble winning the 20% of the vote he needs to qualify for federal matching funds.    REAGAN'S DENIAL that he saw news reports with quotes written for him by Larry Speakes strains credibility even among some former aides. &quot;I'm sure he had to hear about it at the time,&quot; says one, about a quote on the Korean-airliner shootdown. If Reagan didn't see the quotes, critics say, it shows a remarkable lack of curiosity.    MEESE'S MORASS: More departures are expected from the demoralized Justice Department. Even some of Meese's conservative, longtime aides ponder leaving the agency in the next few months. Harvard law school invites Solicitor General Fried to return to its faculty.    GRINDING SLOWLY, the Federal Election Commission makes public over 60 cases resolved as long as a year or more ago; federal law requires release within 30 days of settlement. In a case decided nearly 15 months ago, Georgia's Democratic Party paid a $7,500 fine for using illegal funds to repay $47,000 of a 1982 loan.    SOCIAL-WELFARE BILLS bog down in Congress amid concern over their cost.    Measures to require parental leave, worker notification of safety hazards and employee health insurance now seem unlikely to pass. Welfare overhaul also falters. The House may approve a long-term health-care bill, but mainly for political points; the Senate isn't even expected to consider the multibillion-dollar measure.    Senate Republicans block some of the bills. Some proposed employer requirements are undermined by cost complaints from small businesses. Even a catastrophic-care bill that has been expected to be enacted runs into doubts; elderly constituents question the added cost they would have to pay for the coverage.    Lawmakers want to pass many of these bills; but &quot;there's no money to pay for them,&quot; says GOP Sen. Domenici of New Mexico.    MINOR MEMOS: Larry Speakes's disclosures that he made up Reagan quotes prompts one wag to dub him &quot;Larry Mis-Speakes.&quot; . . . Just in time: After ballyhooing &quot;Moonstruck&quot; on the stump for months, Dukakis finally saw the movie only a day before his cousin won an Academy Award for her role in it. . . . Vacancy sign: A federal housing official is introduced at a conference as &quot;special assistant to the nonexistent assistant secretary.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
