(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A woman wounded by a spurned admirer ina shooting spree that left seven people dead says she was so afraidof the man she moved three times and sought a court order ofprotection.   Laura Black, 26, who police say was the target of Tuesday'sshootings at ESL Inc., was haunted for four years by unwantedadvances from Richard W. Farley, a former co-worker, her lawyersaid. Black was one of four people injured in the siege.   Black had asked a court to order Farley, 39, to never bother heragain, but she was shot and seriously wounded in her office the daybefore her hearing, authorities said.   ``I have been afraid of what this man might do to me if I filethis action,'' she said in her filing with the court. ``However, Iam now at the end of my rope.''   In the filing, Black said she obtained an unlisted phone numberand moved three times, but Farley continued calling her at work,driving by her house and following her to softball games.   San Jose Family Court Commissioner Lois Kittle, who issued atemporary order against Farley on Feb. 2, made it permanentWednesday.   ``This was a consciousness-raising incident,'' she said from thebench in tears. ``It shows pieces of paper do not stop bullets.''   Charges were being prepared against Farley, who was being heldin the Santa Clara County jail in San Jose, prosecutor AlanNudelman said Wednesday. Police Capt. Al Scott said he expectedthem to include multiple counts of homicide, attempted murder andassault with a deadly weapon.   A portrait of Farley as a man with a deadly obsession but noapparent criminal background or pattern of job problems emergedfrom comments by authorities, neighbors and former employers.   When police searched a motor home owned by Farley, they found astockpile of guns and ammunition, along with cans of gasoline,Scott said.   ``He had a lot of guns and a lot of gun knowledge _ apparently alifetime hobby,'' the captain said.   Police say Farley was a Texas native who never married, served11 years in the Navy with an honorable discharge, and started atESL, a Silicon Valley defense contractor, in November 1977. It wasthere that he met Black.   When Farley failed to get dates with Black, he began living in afantasy world, Black's attorney, Mary Bird, said. Farley tookpictures of Black and used them to ``document'' their make-believelife, Bird said.   Neighbors said Farley, who lived in a dilapidated cottage withpeeling paint, was a loner who never said hello to anyone.   Farley was fired in May 1986 from his $36,000-a-year job as asoftware development engineer after sending a letter threateningBlack's life, said Jerry DeRuntz, a company manager.   The attack, said Scott and Lt. Ruben Grijalva, who negotiatedthe gunman's surrender, was Farley's way of ``making a point'' thathe wouldn't tolerate being spurned by Black or laughed at by otherESL employees.   ``He was in love with her from the first moment he saw her,''said Grijalva. ``It was her smile.''   After being fired, Farley found other computer industry jobs,and his current employer, Sunnyvale-based Covalent Systems,released a statement Wednesday saying his work was satisfactory andthere was ``no indication whatsoever of problems.''   At ESL, which does such work as outfitting military spy planes,president Robert Kohler met with about 2,000 grieving employeesoutside the plant Wednesday. He said the deaths were ``like losingmembers of your own family.''   The company said the shootings did not result from any lapse ofsecurity. Scott agreed, noting that Farley gained access byblasting his way through a computer-controlled door.   The building where the shootings took place was closedWednesday, but other buildings at ESL were open.   Black suffered chest, shoulder and spine injuries in theshooting.   Killed were Joe Silva, 43, of Sunnyvale; Buddy Williams, 23, SanJose; Glenda Moritz, 27, Sunnyvale; Ron Reed, 26, Sunnyvale; HelenLaparter, 49, Sunnyvale; Lawrence J. Kane, 46, San Jose; and RonDoney, 36, Manteca.   Injured in addition to Black were Richard Townsley, 44, of SanJose, wounded in the chest, arm, leg and hand; Gregory Scott, 39,of San Jose, shrapnel wounds to the face; and Patty Marcotte of SanJose, who broke her forearm trying to break a window to escape.</TEXT></DOC>
