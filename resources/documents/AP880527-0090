President Roh Tae-woo earlier today ordered a crackdown onradical groups to safeguard the Olympic Games, which open in Seoulin September.   Riot squads moved in quickly when radical students anddissidents attempted to march on City Hall. Police dispersed theprotesters with tear gas and chased them through the streets.   Radical students hurled a few firebombs and rocks at police butmost ran when police charged. Police seized and dragged away dozensof protesters. Some of the protesters were repeatedly punched andkicked.   ``Avenge the Kwangju massacre!'' and ``Down with the militarydictatorship!'' students screamed. They also shouted, ``Drive outthe Yankees!''   The march was the latest to mark the anniversary of the 1980civil uprising in Kwangju, during which about 200 people werekilled. Students accuse Roh of complicity in the government'ssuppression of the 1980 protest.   About 7,000 riot police with shields, truncheons and tear gasrifles were deployed in the center of Seoul. Squads of riot policestood guard on street corners as columns of police swept throughthe street.   The demonstrations also have been anti-American, with protesterscharging that the United States supports military rule in SouthKorea and that it forces the partition of the Korean peninsula.   Meanwhile, a radical student who set himself on fire died fromsevere burns, a student committee announced today.   The committee said Choi Duk-soo, 20, a law student at DankookUniversity, will be be buried Monday in a ``Democratic People'sFuneral'' at a still undetermined site.   Choi doused himself with a flammable liquid and set himselfablaze at a campus just south of Seoul on May 18, the anniversaryof the 1980 uprising.   Classmates said Choi died Thursday at a Seoul hospital and thatthe body was being kept in a student council building on the mainDankook campus in Seoul.   On May 15, another student stabbed himself and leaped from abuilding in a ritual suicide demanding the release of politicalprisoners and reunification of the Korean peninsula.   The death triggered a series of violent anti-governmentdemonstrations.   Roh said such protests imperil the security of the OlympicGames, which open in Seoul in September.   Roh's call for a crackdown on such groups came during a meetingof top law-enforcement officials to review security in and aroundthe Korean peninsula.   ``It is imperative that all possible measures be taken toforestall acts of violence by domestic radical groups to guaranteethe safety of the Olympics and their successful staging,'' Roh toldthe meeting.   It was the first national security meeting Roh has called sincehe took office on Feb. 25. Among those attending the meeting weretop military and police officials and several Cabinet ministers.   Describing the coming months as ``the most dangerous'' since theKorean War in the early 1950's, Roh warned that terrorist groupsmay stage attacks well before the Games open Sept. 17.   The president expressed concern that North Korea would try tosabotage the Olympics, but said attention should also be paid to``left-leaning domestic radicals'' bent on violence.</TEXT></DOC>
