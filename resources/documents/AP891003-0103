WELCH</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Secretary Jack Kemp today is unveiling apackage of proposals aimed at reforming the scandal-plaguedDepartment of Housing and Urban Development, including naming achief financial officer and requiring public registration oflobbyists and consultants, sources familiar with the proposal saidtoday.   Kemp's proposal also calls for the elimination of HUD grantfunds that are awarded at the discretion of the secretary, andwould impose new restrictions on Federal HousingAdministration-backed mortgages for investment and vacationproperty, sources said.   The elimination of HUD's discretionary grants, including on the$3 billion community development block grant program, would meanthe awards would be based on competition.   Kemp planned to announce his reform package at an afternoon newsconference.   Portions of his plans already have been discussed by HUDofficials, including his intention to create a new top-level,independent position of chief financial officer reporting to thesecretary. Kemp's appointee as assistant secretary foradministration, Claire Freeman, told Congress last month that planswere being made for financial officer with broad powers _ aposition that does not exist now in the scandal-plagued department.   HUD has been hit by scandals over alleged mismanagement, fraud,influence peddling, and the steering of lucrative HUD subsidies topolitically favored developers, consultants and lobbyists.Estimates of the cost range into the billions of dollars.   Included in Kemp's package, the sources said, are a requirementthat consultants and lobbyists who deal with the agency registerand publicly disclose their dealings.   A congressional source familiar with the Kemp reforms said Kempalso will propose that HUD kill its Section 8 ModerateRehabilitation Program, the multimillion dollar rent-subsidyprogram found to be riddled with influence peddling.   It was an April audit of that program that set off the currentinvestigations of HUD. The auditors found that subsidies appearedto have been steered to former agency officials and developers whohired prominent GOP consultants to lobby HUD.   Also in the package, a source said, is a proposal providing that1.5 percent of money in each HUD program would be allocated toevaluation of how that program is working _ a move aimed at makingsure HUD officials are aware of program abuses.   Other features would require public dislosure by HUD when it iswaiving any regulations, and restrictions on the obtaining ofdouble subsidies by some developers, such as renovation subsidiesand tax credits.   On FHA, the sources said, the secretary was proposing aprohibition on FHA-backed loans for investment property and secondhomes used as vacatation homes. It will impose tougher capitalrequirements for companies who underwrite a portion of FHA loansunder the multi-family coinsurance program, the sources said.   Dealings by politically connected lobbyists and consultants wasthe subject of a hearing Monday by a House committee that has beeninvestigating the HUD scandals.   The chairman, Rep. Tom Lantos, D-Calif., charged that a``greased, sweetheart deal'' brought $31 million in federal housingsubsidies to a New Jersey renovation project, but the apartmentsare still like slums.   Lantos said ``infinitely more worthy projects'' were deniedfunds when HUD made the grant to the housing project in whichRepublican lobbyist Paul Manafort is a partner.   But Manafort testified at a hearing Monday that his lobbyingcompany ``has worked within the existing system at HUD'' and``played by the rules.''   Lantos said his subcommittee's staff last week visitedManafort's 326-unit Seabrook project in Upper Deerfield, N.J., a1940s complex that Manafort's partnership is renovating with theHUD subsidies.   Lantos said his staff found apartments renting for more than$700 a month, including federal subsidies, but lacking gutters andrefrigerators. Some had suffered water damage, he said.   ``What they saw and heard was shocking, particularly for aproject that is costing taxpayers $31,163,400 in rent subsidiesalone, plus additional millions in tax credits,'' he said.   Referring to the game of ``Monopoly,'' Lantos said: ``For wellover $31 million, I would have expected at least Marvin Gardens.Unfortunately we have here only a slum on Baltic or MediterraneanAvenue.''   Manafort, a former campaign adviser to President Bush and formerPresident Reagan and a former business partner of RepublicanNational Chairman Lee Atwater, underwent contentious questioningfrom the House Government Operations subcommittee on employment andhousing.   Manafort said that while 182 units are occupied, construction isstill under way and asserted, ``When we are finished withconstruction, we believe the tenants will be happy.''   When he appeared before the panel in June, Manafort acknowledgedthat his work amounted to ``influence-peddling.'' However, onMonday he denied receiving an advance tip by HUD insiders on theavailability of subsidies for renovating low-income housingprojects, which were prized profit-makers for developers.   He said he had little contact with Deborah Gore Dean, the formerexecutive assistant to former HUD Secretary Sam Pierce who is afocus of the panel's probe into alleged politicalinfluence-peddling at HUD. Dean, Pierce and two other former HUDofficials have refused to testify on constitutional grounds.   But two associates in Manafort's lobbying company acknowledgedfurther contacts with Dean. Laurence Gay testified he met with Deanand discussed the New Jersey project. Another associate, RichardDavis, was a former White House liaison to HUD who said he had beenin contact with Dean daily while in government.   Manafort contended that partners in the development faced normalbusiness risks, including the potential loss of a $450,000 downpayment, in buying the dilapidated housing and putting together apackage of subsidies and financing.   Lantos, however, contended Manafort had enjoyed an inside lineto top HUD officials and was able to bypass procedures at HUD'sregional office.   ``This was a greased, sweetheart deal, where all theparticipants knew what the final outcome would be,'' Lantos said.``Deborah Dean promised them the units (of subsidy) and shedelivered on the units. Those are the facts.''</TEXT></DOC>
