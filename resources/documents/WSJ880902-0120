In a speech yesterday, his first public statement in more than a week, Mr. Maung Maung offered scant hope for a quick end to weeks of civil unrest and political stalemate. With neither the government, the military nor opposition leaders acting to end the standoff, conditions are increasingly anarchic, diplomats said.    &quot;The government has completely abdicated its duty of leadership,&quot; a diplomat said. And with no individual or group coming forward to fill the vacuum, &quot;no one knows how or when order and government will be restored.&quot;    Rumors of an impending military coup continued to sweep Rangoon, the capital, though diplomats say the army has kept a low profile since martial law was lifted Aug. 24. Diplomats can't predict if the military, which forms the backbone of the ruling Burma Socialist Program Party, will continue to support the government or side with those demanding democracy.    Hundreds of thousands of protesters -- including large contingents from government ministries -- marched through Rangoon yesterday morning to protest the party's continuing rule. Employees in government offices and companies returned to work Wednesday to collect their monthly pay, but most went on strike yesterday, diplomats said. Rail, road and sea transport has been disrupted for days, and a strike by air-traffic controllers closed Rangoon's airport yesterday.    Food prices are soaring in Rangoon. Diplomats say serious food shortages may occur within a week as a lack of gasoline makes transportation difficult.    In his speech, Mr. Maung Maung reiterated the government's plans for an emergency party meeting Sept. 12 to consider holding a national referendum on a multiparty political system, which could pave the way for a democratic government. &quot;This arrangement is the most we can concede,&quot; he said, as heard on a radio broadcast monitored in Bangkok.    The president did agree to &quot;a disciplined formation of a students' union,&quot; and said the government would rebuild the students' union building, destroyed by the government in a bloody 1962 episode. Reconstructing the building is a symbolic demand of students, who have been at the head of the months-long demonstrations.    But Mr. Maung Maung's cosmetic concessions are unlikely to quell protests, especially since students formed an All-Burma Students' Union on Sunday in defiance of the constitution. Since Sunday, illegal labor unions of dockworkers and seamen as well as associations of teachers and other professionals have mushroomed in Rangoon.    In the capital yesterday, the government appeared to be in control only of broadcast studios, power stations, banks, telephones and the military, a diplomat said. Most neighborhoods are barricaded and are policed by local citizens.    Outside Rangoon, &quot;it's difficult to think of a town that's known to be under the control of the government,&quot; a diplomat said. In most areas, monks and students control the administrative apparatus.    Monks and students apparently ignored a government order Wednesday that they vacate government buildings. Instead of repeating the order, Mr. Maung Maung thanked the monks and people who he said were taking care of local administration and urged &quot;public services, transportation and bank personnel to return to work.&quot;    Much of the impasse, diplomats agree, stems from the enigmatic role of Ne Win, who resigned July 23, more than a quarter century after seizing power in a military coup and starting the country down his economically and socially disastrous &quot;Burmese Way to Socialism.&quot;    Because Mr. Ne Win ruled the country almost single-handedly for so long, he still commands deference and continues to exercise autocratic power behind the scenes, diplomats said. In both the government and the military, &quot;no one is prepared to cross Ne Win, or do anything without his approval,&quot; a diplomat said.    Even among the current regime's opponents, &quot;no one, except maybe the students, is prepared to take Ne Win on,&quot; another diplomat said. &quot;Even the grown-up opposition figures who are suggesting change aren't demanding that he leave the country.&quot; Many believe substantive political change can't occur while Ne Win remains in Burma, but diplomats say they see no indication he is preparing to flee. </TEXT></DOC>
