StevensStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 08/06/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> EUROP JAPAN FREST CANDAMONETARY NEWS, FOREIGN EXCHANGE, TRADE (MON)FOREIGN-EXCHANGE MARKETS (FRX)PRECIOUS METALS, STONES, GOLD, SILVER (PCS)COMMODITY NEWS, FARM PRODUCTS (CMD) </IN><TEXT>   The dollar dropped back in foreign exchange trading in response to intervention by the West German central bank.    Despite the Bundesbank's dollar sales, traders said, simmering tensions in the Middle East probably will keep the upward pressure on the U.S. currency.    A Bundesbank spokesman in Frankfurt confirmed that the central bank sold dollars yesterday after the U.S. currency came off an intraday high of 1.8890 West German marks. That represents a high-water mark for the dollar in its current rally sparked by fears of a widening Persian Gulf conflict.    The dollar climbed to 6 1/2-month highs early this week as investors sought the currency after Iran threatened to expand its war against Iraq to include other Mideast nations and the U.S. The Iranian threat followed the deaths of rioting Iranian pilgrims in Saudi Arabia Friday.    In late New York trading yesterday, the dollar stood at 1.8804 marks, compared with 1.8885 late Tuesday. It also fell to 150.82 Japanese yen from 151.68, and the British pound climbed to $1.5797 from $1.5735.    In early Tokyo trading today, the dollar was quoted at 150.70 yen.    Market participants generally viewed yesterday's Bundesbank intervention in the context of February's Paris agreement between the U.S. and its major allies to keep exchange rates stable. Periodic intervention since that agreement has led many traders to believe that the major central banks aim to keep the dollar roughly between 1.80 and 1.90 marks.    Other market speculation holds that the central banks only want to dull any sharp spikes in exchange-rate movements.    &quot;At the moment, they're putting a cap on the dollar at 1.8850 (marks),&quot; Yani M.A. Budiman, vice president, corporate foreign exchange, at Chemical Bank, New York, said. However, he said, the dollar will remain supported &quot;as long as tensions in the Mideast continue.&quot;    Martin Rieben, vice president, foreign exchange, for Swiss Bank Corp. in New York, said &quot;the dollar will slowly go up&quot; even if central bank intervention against the currency is resumed.    &quot;It's the Middle East, it's the uncertainty. We don't know what's cooking, but we smell it everywhere,&quot; Mr. Rieben said. &quot;I feel secure if I have a few dollars in my pocket.&quot;    The chief trader at one bank with close central bank ties speculated that West Germany may have had its own reasons for intervening. The Bundesbank, along with the U.S. Federal Reserve and other central banks, bought large amounts of dollars this spring to halt a steep dive in the U.S. currency's value. In selling dollars yesterday, the trader said, the Bundesbank could have registered a sizable foreign exchange profit.    &quot;I think they'd be thrilled if the dollar went higher,&quot; he said.    In addition, he said, any Bundesbank move to sell dollars and buy marks would help West Germany's efforts to control its rapidly expanding money supply.    On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery fell $10.80 an ounce to $466.80 in brisk trading. Estimated volume was 5.8 million ounces.    Gold was quoted at $467.85 an ounce in early trading today in Hong Kong.    ---                    LATE NEW YORK TRADING                   Wednesday, Aug. 5, 1987    Based on average of late afternoon buying and sellingrates.
