 John Smart Hitchin HertfordshireandM;DISK DEBATEandM;I was surprised to read Rob Beattie's remarks about what users do and don'tneed in a laptop computer, when comparing the new Compaq LTE with the ToshibaT1000SE (issue 119).andP;  In particular, he insists that notebook PC users don'tneed a hard disk -- indeed, he seems to applaud the Toshiba's lack of a'power-hungry hard disk' as a positive advantage.andM;Compaq took the trouble, as usual, to ask users what they wanted during thedevelopment of the Compaq LTE.andP;  A sample of 125 UK-based DP decision-makersin medium/large organizations that owned laptops, or planned to buy them,showed that memory and storage capability came a high second in a long listof factors they would consider in choosing a laptop and only 9 per cent saidthey didn't need a hard disk.andP;  Over half (57 per cent) wanted a 20Mb disk,while another 29 per cent wanted 40Mb or more.andM;For those users who genuinely don't need a hard disk, the Compaq LTE offerssuch a model.andP;  If they do need one, the Compaq LTE and LTE/286 offer that too-- and with longer battery life, despite this 'power-hungry' additionalfeature.andP;  Joe McNally Vice president and managing director CompaqandM;Rob Beattie replies: Compaq has always been strong, but sensitive -- and inthis case it seems particularly so.andP;  Firstly, my remarks two issues backcentred not around the Compaq LTE, but around the Toshiba T1000SE.andP;  There's asimple reason for this.andP;  Toshiba was able to supply us with a machine toreview, while Compaq declined the opportunity: as ye sow...andM;Secondly, in no sense did I compare the Compaq LTE Directly to the Toshiba,either generally or in particular.andP;  Certainly, I maintain that hard disks inlaptops of this kind are an unnecessary extravagance, and that's why Ipraised the Toshiba.andP;  I'd welcome the opportunity to have my mind changed,and perhaps we can arrange an opportunity to spend some time with theappropriate Compaq LTE.andM;In the meantime, it's gratifying that a US company spends so much timeconsulting UK users and then acting on what they say.andP;  Those who maintainthat US companies only listen to US users -- take note of Compaq's shiningexample.andP;  One word of caution.andP;  DP decision makers in medium/largeorganizations are as liable as the rest of us when it comes to trying to givethe 'right' answer to surveys.andP;  And it's still a matter of some debate as towhether their views and those of their PC users always coincide, anyway...andM;REMEMBER UNCLE CLIVE?andM;I enjoyed the article on PC lightweights in PC User, issue 119, but why isthere no mention of CCL's Z88?andM;I am a PC user and have bought a Z88 to enable me to write from my client'spremises.andP;  I intend to squirt script into my PC on returning to my base.andM;So far I'm learning to work the machine and haven't as yet used the Z88 forbusiness purposes.andM;The machine is brilliant.andP;  Personally, I forgive Sir Clive for the C5.andO;Isambard Kingdom Brunel and others also made some silly mistakes; true talentwill always surface.andP;  Clive Cassel Tonbridge KentandM;PC User replies: There's nothing wrong with the Z88 -- they're usedextensively here at PC User and are a useful adjunct to a desktop computer,PC or Macintosh.andP;  Despite its undoubted features, however -- long batterylife, weight, convenience, rotten word processor -- the Z88 is by no stretchof the imagination a full-function, PC-compatible laptop, which is what wewere concentrating on.andM;THE WORM TURNSandM;Shame!andP;  Once again the humble WORM has been unfairly treated.andP;  PeterJackson's article on Optical Storage (issue 118) boldly states 'For truerandom access any optical drive is a poor performer'.andP;  There are many CAVWORM drives available whose performance characteristics are comparable toWinchester speeds; indeed, in certain circumstances, WORM transfer ratesoutperform Winchesters: WORMs don't suffer file fragmentation (all data iswritten contiguously) as Winchesters do and a single (optical) seek is fasterthan multiple (hard disk) equivalents.andM;I must balance this criticism with praise: Jackson has acknowledged that WORMtechnology has its place -- not as some interim prior to erasables, but inits own right where permanence is desired.andP;  After all, it's one of the firstrules of computing that what can be erased, will!andM;As to the sign-off in your article regarding retrieval, our companyspecializes in complete systems comprising full-text and image retrievalbased on a WORM.andP;  One of our most popular application areas is that of telexstorage: Barclaycard, for example, creates some 3,000 telexes a day; anysingle telex can now be retrieved (using any word or phrase in the content)in seconds.andM;It's also a boon to journalists to be able to recall what they've written! DR Abbott Systems Manager Computer andamp; Aerospace ComponentsandM;Peter Jackson replies: There was no intention to be unfair to WORM drives; asyou note, I believe that their permanence and longevity will make them theprime choice for data archiving over the next few years.andP;  In general terms,however, it's true that optical drives are poor performers when true randomaccess is required.andM;There are CAV WORM drives whose access times are comparable with slowWinchester drives -- although the fastest drive, the Maximum StorageAPX-4200, provides a 28ms access time using its own file system instead ofMS-DOS -- and whose data transfer rates, particularly using SCSI or ESDIcontrollers, are almost as high as fast Winchesters.andP;  But true random accessmeans moving the read-write head to random sectors on the disk surface asquickly as possible, and the mass of the optical head makes this inevitablyslower on WORM or any other optical drive.andM;For instance, the fast modified-CAV Corel 940 WORM drive is 40 per centslower than an ESDI Winchester at pure data transfer during backup orrestoration, but 800 per cent slower at random access during a databasesearch, say.andP;  The fast data transfer rates make WORMs ideal for backup, buttheir random access performance isn't impressive.andM;As for fragmentation, it's true that each time a file is written to a WORMdisk in full, it occupies contiguous sectors and high data transfer rates canbe achieved.andP;  But most WORM drives don't now write a complete new copy ofeach file as it's updated, to save disk space, and accessing a linked-list ofpointers to updated information shows up the slow random access performanceagain.andP;  There's a place for WORMs, but not as Winchester replacements.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
