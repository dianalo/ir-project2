Issued September27, 1985, the one-paragraph statement begins with the welcome assertionthat the Administration's policy is not to restrict the products of fundamentalresearch. The statement adds that where national security interests dointrude upon fundamental research activities, classification will bethe primary mechanism for control. However, a more careful reading ofthe directive, and of the cover memorandum circulated with it to Cabinetofficers, reveals a loophole through which the Administration was onceagain shaking the reins of control. The innocuous phrase appeared atthe very end of the directive, forbidding the placement of restrictionsupon unclassified federally funded fundamental research except as providedin applicable US statutes. Expanding on this phrase, the cover memorandumemphasized that the directive preserved the ability of the agencies tocontrol unclassified information using legislated authority providedexpressly for that purpose in applicable US statutes. The memorandummade no mention of the need to preserve openness in scientific and technicalcommunication or to exercise caution in controlling unclassified information.</TEXT></DOC>
