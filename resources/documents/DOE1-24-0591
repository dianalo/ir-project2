<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-24-0591 </DOCNO><TEXT>The structure, kinematics, and general chemical properties of the majorGalactic components are examined, reviewing the results of recent observationaland theoretical investigations. Topics addressed include age-metallicityand age-velocity relations for the old disk, the structure and stabilityof the old disk, the thick disk, the metal-weak halo, the globular-clustersystem, the shape of the halo, and the bulge. Diagrams and graphs areprovided. 135 references.</TEXT></DOC>
