Box369, Antioch, CA 94509, Snowden Enterprises, Inc., P.O. Box 751, Fresno,CA 93712, Frupac International Corp., 400 Market St., Suite 500, Philadelphia,PA 19106, and Quimica Osku, Ltda., 853 Agustinas St., Office No. 831, Santiago,Chile proposing to amend 40 CFR Part 180 by establishing a tolerance topermit residues of the fungicide sulfur dioxide in or on grapes at 20 partsper million (ppm).The petitioners subsequently amended this petition proposing to establisha tolerance to permit residues of sulfur dioxide in or on grapes at 10ppm, the current level of detection determined by the modified Monier-Williamsmethod used by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for its enforcementprocedures.Submission of this petition was prompted by an announcement by FDA in the<T4>Federal Register</T4> of July 9, 1986 (51 FR 25021) that the use ofsulfiting agents as preservatives on raw fruits and vegetables served orsold to consumers was no longer deemed to be generally recognized as safe(GRAS) because some individuals experience severe allergic reactions tosulfite residues on food. FDA's action did not affect the use of sulfitingagents as a fungicide on grapes because this pesticidal use is under EPA'sjurisdiction. In light of FDA's action, and because EPA no longer regarded the use ofsulfiting agents on grapes as it it were GRAS (for the reasons set forthby FDA with regard to preservative uses) and had not established a tolerancefor sulfite residues in or on grapes, EPA announced in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of December 31, 1986 (51 FR 47240) an interimpolicy requiring that each foreign or domestic shipper have an acceptablecertification program to ensure that residues of sulfites (determined assulfur dioxide) on treated grapes were below the current level of detectionunder the modified Monier-Williams procedure, i.e., less than 10 ppm whenthe grapes were offered for entry into the United States or were otherwiseintroduced into interstate commerce. This policy was intended to allowfor the continued marketing of sulfite-treated grapes while the residuedata necessary to support the tolerance petition were being submitted.This policy was subsequently amended by documents published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of August 26, 1987 (52 FR 32128) to allow forshort-term tagging of individual bunches of grapes and of December 31,1987 (52 FR 49411) to allow the continuation of the certification provisionsof EPA's December 31, 1986 notice for the 1987-1988 grape shipping season.These certification provisions will remain in effect through the 1988-1989grape-shipping season until a permanent tolerance for sulfur dioxide residuesin or on grapes is established.In its July 9, 1986 Notice, FDA concluded that the use of sulfites as preservativeson fruits and vegetables intended to be served raw or sold raw to consumersposes a risk to that discrete and relatively small segment of the populationwhich is sulfite sensitive. EPA has reviewed the data evaluated by FDApertaining to sulfite sensitivity that were cited in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>of August 14, 1985 (50 FR 32834), and additionalinformation set forth in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>of July 9, 1986 (51 FR 25012 and 25021), andagrees with the conclusions reached by FDA with respect to this potentialadverse effect to individuals who are sulfite sensitive.  Since the health effect of concern is sulfite sensitivity, no additionalanimal toxicity data are required under 40 CFR 158.135 to support a sulfurdioxide tolerance. If EPA receives information indicating health concernsother than sulfite sensitivity, a reevaluation of the toxicological database for sulfites will be undertaken.  EPA is aware that there may be some risks to sulfite-sensitive individualsfrom the presence of low levels of sulfites in grapes; however, EPA believesthat establishing a tolerance at the current level of detection, 10 ppm,will minimize this risk.  During the past year, EPA has evaluated much of the data generated by Chileanexporters and California growers through their certification programs.These data indicate that a majority of shippers can maintain sulfur dioxideresidues at or below 10 ppm. Therefore, the Agency is establishing a toleranceat the 10 ppm limit of detection.  The pesticide is useful for the purposes of this tolerance rule. Adequateanalytical methodology (modified Monier-Williams) is available for enforcementpurposes. EPA does not anticipate that sulfite residues in grapes pomaceresulting from this use will cause secondary residues in meat and milk.Sulfite residues in other commercially available feeds, with residue levelssignificantly higher than in grape pomace, have produced no secondary residuesin meat and milk.  Based on the above information considered by the Agency, the toleranceestablished by amending 40 CFR Part 180 would protect the public health.It is proposed, therefore, that the tolerance be established as set forthbelow.  Any person who has registered or submitted an application for registrationof a pesticide, under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and RodenticideAct, as amended, which contains any of the ingredients listed herein, mayrequest within 30 days after publication of this document in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>that this proposal be referred to an AdvisoryCommittee in accordance with section 408(e) of the Federal Food, Drug,and Cosmetic Act.  Elsewhere in this issue of the <T4>Federal Register, </T4>in the rules and regulations section, EPA isextending its interim policy for sulfiting agents on grapes (see [OPP-36145D]). Interested persons are invited to submit written comments on the proposedregulations. Comments must bear a notation: All written comments filedin response to this proposed rule will be available in the Product Manager'soffice, Registration Division, at the address given above from 9 a.m. to4:30 p.m., Monday through Friday, excluding legal holidays.  The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this rule from the requirementsof section 3 of Executive Order 12291.  Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L.96-354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601-612), the Administrator has determinedthat regulations establishing exemptions from tolerance requirements donot have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of smallentities. A certification statement to this effect was published in the<T4>Federal Register </T4>of May 4, 1981 (46 FR 24950).<ITAG tagnum="20">(Sec. 408(e), 68 Stat. 514 (21 U.S.C. 346a(e)).)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 180  </ITAG>Administrative practice and procedures, Agriculture commodities, Pesticidesand pests.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: December 29, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Douglas D.
