(products).andO;Product:   Gallery (Computer network software).andO;Topic:     EvaluationLocal Area NetworksElectronic Mail SystemsMenus.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>GalleryandM;On the first page of its documentation, Gallery has the subtitle &quot;ElectronicMail, Menus and File Manager for PC Networks,&quot; which is a good description ofwhat the product is and does.andP;  Gallery is a menu program that isolates usersfrom the DOS command line, gives them easy access to their most commonapplications, helps them send electronic mail, and aides them in managingtheir files.andM;Gallery is a good program for users who are learning to network.andP;  It has aniconic user interface, which makes life a little easier for DOS-phobic users.andO;Each icon is made from ASCII characters, allowing Gallery to work on anynetwork, any workstation and any monitor.andP;  From Gallery, just about any DOSor network function can be performed.andP;  Experienced DOS LAN users, however,won't find much use for Gallery, unless they have no other electronic mailsystem.andM;InstallationandM;We installed Gallery on a network running Novell NetWare 2.12.andP;  The processtook very little time, though we did have a small problem since the programhad a difficult time finding a version of COMMAND.COM.andP;  We were using amachine with only one floppy disk.andP;  Once this small problem was corrected,the program asked a few questions, which were easy to answer, and copied therequired files to the PUBLIC directory of the NetWare server.andM;Installing Gallery for use by diskless PCs and floppy-only computers requiressetting an environmental variable called GHOME.andP;  This can be done in theAUTOEXEC.BAT file with the SET command.andP;  GHOME corresponds to the homedirectory in which Gallery will search for COMMAND.COM.andP;  Usually, this is auser's private directory on the file server.andP;  To add the environment variablemay require allocating more environment space using a command in CONFIG.SYSor elsewhere (e.g.andP;  the system login script).andM;Once Gallery's files are installed, the next step is to configure the menus.andO;Gallery allows the LAN manager to set up a customized menu structure for eachuser.andP;  There are some 33 icons that may be used, all of them created withASCII characters.andP;  The diagrams accompanying this article have some examplesof what these icons look like.andP;  Future versions will have additional iconchoices.andM;When Gallery is installed, a single--layer menu structure is automaticallyinstalled.andP;  For NetWare networks this includes icons for some of the majormanagement functions, like SYSCON, FILER, SESSION, PCONSOLE, etc.andP;  Eachfunction has its own icon.andM;Adding and subtracting icons to the first layer of the menu system very easy,using Gallery's administrative function.andP;  Behind each icon lies a batch file,which is written within the Gallery administrative module.andP;  Gallery providesa few functions to simplify the creation of batch files.andP;  These may be calledin the batch files written by the LAN manager.andP;  They include MENU, DOS, EXIT,and USER.andP;  MENU calls another menu, allowing for the creation of amany-layered menu system for each user.andP;  DOS takes the user temporarily toDOS.andP;  EXIT takes the user out of Gallery.andP;  USER substitutes theeight-character logon name of the user, allowing the LAN manager to make onemenu system for many users while still giving each user access to their ownprograms and data.andM;Gallery takes care of getting in and out of batch files.andP;  That is, the LANmanager does not need to specify the return to Gallery when an application isfinished.andM;All security in Gallery is handled by the network.andP;  That is, Gallery simplyobeys the security of the network.andP;  Storing Gallery menus and files inprivate directories and using the network security to protect thosedirectories is the best way to secure Gallery files, as well as access toapplications &quot;behind&quot; Gallery.andM;Setting up Gallery and creating a menu structure took about two hours thefirst time we did it.andP;  The more we used the program the faster administrationand menu configuration went.andM;Using GalleryandM;Gallery is relatively easy to use.andP;  Icons are selected in one of two ways,either with the cursor or with the first letter of the name associated withthe icon, e.g.andP;  WordStar or Syscon.andP;  Gallery does not have mouse support.andO;Once an icon is selected, ENTER calls the batch file associated with it.andP;  Thebatch file runs, starting up an application.andP;  When the application is exited,Gallery returns.andM;Two functions come with Gallery: File and Mail.andP;  Gallery File gives usersiconic access to standard DOS commands, like FORMAT, ERASE, CD, COPY, TYPEand PRINT.andP;  By specifying a default word processor at installation, the ViewFile icon will bring up that word processor with the selected file.andP;  Otherfunctions in File include the ability to change drives and exit temporily toDOS.andP;  Only the most DOS-phobic users will find much use for Gallery File.andM;Gallery Mail is an easy-to-use eletronic mail system.andP;  When users first enterGallery they are notified with beep if they have mail.andP;  If they wish to readtheir mail they hit the Mail icon.andP;  Once in Gallery Mail, the In Tray iconindicates there is mail waiting with a letter in the tray.andP;  Incoming messagesmay be selected and read (a rather cumbersome process), answered, forwarded,saved locally, printed and discarded.andP;  If the user is not in Gallery Mailwhen a message arrives, a notice will be placed on the bottom of the screen(on non-Novell networks this message might appear other places).andM;Manipulating through Gallery Mail is fairly easy and all choices arepresented on the screen.andP;  Some of the keystrokes are odd.andP;  For example, allmessages to be read must be selected at once, then read one by one.andP;  Afterreading the mail, users are put back to the original Mail menu, not the readmail screen.andP;  This is not a huge inconvenience, but does take some gettingused to.andP;  The ALL key, F9, selects all the incoming mail and immediatelydisplays the first message.andP;  The F3 and F4 keys then allow the user to moveforward and back through all selected messages.andM;Sending mail with Gallery is easy.andP;  Once a message is created it can be sentto an individual, a group of selected users, a personal list, a system listor a combination.andP;  Users can create as many of their own lists as they wish.andO;System list are created by the Lan manager.andM;With Gallery Mail, users may enclose as many files as they wish with amessage.andP;  The recipient then decides where to put the message and theenclosed files by saving them to the directory of their choice.andM;One nice feature of Gallery Mail is the ability to automatically forward mailandM;to a user of choice.andP;   Sending users areandM;notified that their message will be forwarded before they send it.andP;  In th isway, truly confidential mail will not be sent to the wrong person.andP;  This ishelpful when users are unable to answer their mail for long periods of time.andM;Another neat feature of Gallery Mail is password lockout.andP;  Users who leavetheir desks can hit a key combination to bring up a password screen.andP;  Thisscreen requires the user enter a password to get back into Gallery Mail.andO;Users who do not touch their keyboards for ten minutes will automatically beput into this password screen.andP;  Passing intruders thus have no access to usermail unless they know the password.andP;  The password can be one selected by theuser or the network login password.andP;  This feature works only in the Mailmodule, nowhere else in Gallery.andP;  For further security, all Gallery mail isencrypted on disk.andM;ExtrasandM;Gallery comes with a set of network utility programs.andP;  These include GNUwhich passes the first eight characters of the user name to a command in abatch file.andP;  GASK is used to provide decision trees within batch files.andP;  Thisallows users to make a choice about which way a batch file should branch.andP;  Itworks with DOS error levels.andM;GBOOT does just what it sounds like.andP;  It reboots the PC.andP;  GDVER gives the DOSversion being used, which helps in the creation of a single batch file forall versions of DOS on the network.andP;  GISDIR will indicate if a directoryexists or not.andP;  GKB indicates the type of keyboard being used, 84 or 101keys.andP;  GSCRIPT will display the login script for the system or a user andworks only on Novell networks.andM;Finally, also for NetWare networks only, NW returns four things, depending onthe parameters used: user ID, user full name, supervisor test and theinternal NetWare usser number.andM;All of the network utilities that come with Gallery can help users buildsophisticated batch files, though none of the programs do anything thatcannot be done with other programs or with NetWare itself.andM;ConclusionandM;Gallery has strengths and weaknesses.andP;  In fact, many of its strengths arealso its weaknesses.andP;  Its strengths are its use of ASCII icons, itssimplicity and the auto-forwarding and password lockout of Gallery Mail.andO;These things, Gallery's structure and its tailoring for NetWare make usingGallery relatively simple.andP;  Small NetWare networks with new users willbenefit from both what Gallery does and what it enables users to do withbatch files.andM;Gallery's simplicity and ASCII icons are also weaknesses, however.andP;  The ASCIIicons which come with Gallery can be obscure.andP;  They are not as pretty asthose many of us have come to expect with Windows and the Macintosh.andP;  Thesimplicity of Gallery also makes it clumsy.andP;  Many operations take three orfour steps instead of one.andP;  For example, to erase a mail message requiresselecting the message, hitting &quot;D&quot; for the Discard icon (or moving to it withthe arrow keys), hitting return, then selecting yes or no and hitting returnagain.andP;  The first &quot;D&quot; is enough.andP;  One key is all that should be needed toerase a message.andP;  Similar operations occur throughout Gallery, causing toomany keystrokes.andM;Beginners may not be put off by the keystrokes, since Gallery guides usersthrough each step.andP;  More experienced users will be frustrated.andM;Gallery's user interface could be tightened up a bit.andP;  The Mail program andthe File program could also use improvement.andP;  The Mail module should allowusers to look at enclosed files without having to go to the File module.andP;  TheFile module should show more than 16 files at a time and be able to show adirectory tree structure.andP;  Other Mail improvements would include the abilityto send mail between file servers and, most importantly, some sort of pop-upmodule that allows users to send and receive mail, the basics, from withinany application.andP;  To compete with other mail systems, Gallery Mail will needthese improvements, along with the ability to send mail remotely.andM;Gallery by Daystrom Data Products is for beginners.andP;  Gallery is good for newLAN managers who are just getting their feet wet in networking.andP;  It will helpthem create a manageable menu system for all LAN users.andP;  Gallery will alsoteach them a thing or two about batch files.andP;  Because of the icons, it makesaccess to network management utilities a bit easier.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
