Grossman of participating in Mr. Grossman's illegal stock scheme.    Shimon Lev, husband of a Grossman cousin, was accused in an SEC civil lawsuit of making, along with a previously named defendant, illegal stock profit of $437,972. He allegedly used inside data Mr. Grossman misappropriated while he was a lawyer at the firm Kramer, Levin, Nessen, Kamin andamp; Frankel. In the suit filed in U.S. District Court yesterday, the SEC requested Mr. Lev surrender the profits and pay an additional penalty of as much as three times the gain.    Mr. Lev is the eighth person accused in the Grossman case.    As previously reported, Mr. Grossman and six others, including Mr. Lev's brother David, were charged by the SEC in February with making $1.5 million in illegal profits on an investment of $33,938 in Colt Industries Inc. stock options. That case is pending. In addition, Mr. Grossman last month received a two-year prison term on related criminal charges.    Drawing on testimony from the Grossman trial, the SEC's new suit accuses Shimon Lev rather than his brother David of using information from Mr. Grossman, though David Lev still is accused of wrongdoing. David Lev was in Israel during the time of the trading. Rather than being responsible for the trading, the SEC now accuses him of trying to protect his brother and Mr. Grossman when he got back by claiming &quot;falsely&quot; that he ordered the trades from Israel.    Shimon Lev's attorney, Charles E. Clayman, said his client will fight the charges. &quot;It's a terrible sin when one brother sells his birthright to get the SEC off his back,&quot; Mr. Clayman said, referring to David Lev's agreement to testify at the Grossman trial. &quot;Like Abel he'll prevail.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
