One reason uncovered by Computerworld is that the machine is toodamn' successful already in a market where IBM doesn't want the machine toplay - its own 3090 market: the paper identifies eight companies - PlayboyEnterprises Inc, Hiram Walker andamp; Sons Inc, Kaiser Aluminum andamp; Chemical Corp, USShoe Corp, Arco Chemical Co and Johnson andamp; Johnson, all either cutting backtheir 370 growth plans and putting the work onto AS/400s or dumping theantique 370 architecture for the AS/400 altogether - Georgia-Pacific Corp isnear completion on replacing its 3081 with 20 AS/400s and several System 36son a Token Ring network - and the reason given in most cases is the bigsavings in cost, suggesting that IBM's policy of regularly increasingsoftware prices way above the inflation rate is yielding diminishing returns.andM;- o -andM;Four companies are said to be in the bidding for Hoskyns Group Plc at about#400m: Nynex Corp has publicly declared its interest in putting Hoskynsalongside its BIS acquisition, and ATandamp;T Co is believed to want to add thecompany to its Istel Ltd buy - but will either of those want it to retain itsLondon quotation? A long list of others that may well be interested includesCap Gemini Sogeti SA and BellSouth Corp; the price is likely to put it out ofreach of UK firms.andM;- o -andM;Cray Computer Corp, based in the old Inmos International plant in ColoradoSprings, Colorado, says that it has licked all the problems in building itsforthcoming supercomputers in Gallium Arsenide, and that it will be able toput the chips to be used in the machine into volume production and repair thesupercomputers in the field.andM;- o -andM;Apple Computer Inc is to lay off 400 to 500 in the US, possibly as soon astomorrow says the San Francisco Chronicle, which says Apple's privateelectronic has been buzzing with staff chatter on the layoff.andM;- o -andM;ATandamp;T Co, Basking Ridge, New Jersey wants to reduce the number of its vastcomputer centres that process its long-distance telephone accounting,engineering and marketing around the US to seven from the present 12, puttingabout 1,000 jobs in jeopardy at the centres to close: it hopes to save $70m ayear from the closures, which are to be made by 1992; the ones to close areCincinnati; Greensboro; Hamilton Township, New Jersey; Oakton, Virginia; andFairhaven, Massachusetts and it hopes to achieve the closures withoutlay-offs; the remaining computer centres will be in Denver; Alpharetta;Kansas City, Missouri; Mesa; Orlando; and Bridgewater and Knightsbridge, NewJersey; it has already shut 10 such bases since 1987, and employment ininformation management services is now 7,400, from 7,700 in 1987.andM;- o -andM;Dun andamp; Bradstreet Corp reports that Frank Dodge, co-founder of its McCormack andamp;Dodge unit, has resigned his posts as president and chief executive of thesoftware business to pursue other business opportunities: John Imlay, founderand head of the Management Science America Inc acquisition will now becomechairman and chief executive of the new Dun andamp; Bradstreet Software companybeing formed from the merger of the two businesses; in Europe, Dun has alsoturned to MSA for its head of worldwide operations, appointing Michael Huntto the post.andM;- o -andM;But it seems that Frank Dodge's departure from the new Dun andamp; BradstreetSoftware was a less than happy one: he wouldn't go into details yesterday,but says he plans to release a statement tomorrow.andM;- o -andM;Having wrapped up its acquisition of the privately-held $11m-a-year EssentialSoftware Inc for about $20.5m of its own shares, Goal Systems InternationalInc, Cincinnati, Ohio says it is negotiating to buy two other firms in theIBM mainframe software world, MVS Software Inc and Tower Systems Inc.andM;- o -andM;Computers, peripherals and semiconductors now represent the overwhelmingproportion of Hewlett-Packard Co's business - during the fiscal firstquarter, they represented 88.7% of the total, leaving medical electronicequipment and service at 7.0% and instruments at just 4.3%.andM;- o -andM;Mercury Callpoint now has over 15,000 site agreements for Telepoint basestations around the UK, adding sites provided by organisations such asBritish Rail, Allied Breweries and the Post Office to existing installations:stations are being installed at a rate of 100 a week, with afully-operational service comprising 25,000 stations the target within fiveyears.andM;- o -andM;Foster City, California-based Go Gorp, one of the companies in which MitchKapor took an interest after he left Lotus Development Corp, has tapped Dan'lLewin, formerly of NeXT Inc to be its vice-president of sales and marketing,and Paul Hammel from GRiD Systems Corp to be vice-president of operations;Lewin - a co-founder of NeXT - was most recently vice-president of sales.andM;- o -andM;MCI Communications Corp reports two new contracts worth about $40m in totalfrom the US Department of Defense and Du Pont Co: it is to join forces withContel Federal Systems to provide a worldwide network for the US Army DefenceMedical Supply System Communications Network worth $25m to MCI over fiveyears; the contract from Du Pont is worth some $15m over three years.andM;- o -andM;Australia's Department of Administrative Services thought it a great idea toget people tendering for contracts to return an MS-DOS floppy disk with theirresponses to a screen-based question-and-answer tender document, but now it'snot so sure because it received an unwelcome parasite with one of the disksthat came back, reports Newsbytes: the thing had a virus on-board, but thefolks in Canberra were canny enough to screen all the disks withMicrosoft-supplied virus-scanning utilities, and these found the virus beforethe disk got near the network; an investigation concluded that the tendererwas unaware that his system was contaminated - yeah, well, it's not much of atale, but it's better than any of the plots in Neighbours i'nn'it.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
