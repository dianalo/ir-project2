In fact, the opposite is true. This lawsuit posed aserious threat to freedom of artistic expression, which iswhy the American Civil Liberties Union and the WashingtonCoalition Against Censorship filed a friend-of-the-courtbrief supporting the author and producers.</LP><TEXT>   In attempting to stop the play, &quot;Janis,&quot; Ms. Joplin'sheirs argued that they had the exclusive right to control allartistic explorations of the singer's name, likeness andperformance style. This extremely broad interpretation of theso-called &quot;right of publicity,&quot; if accepted by the courts,would threaten the creators of any film, book, play or otherwork, whether fiction or nonfiction, dealing with the life orpersonality of a performer. Ordinarily, the right ofpublicity is limited to commercial exploitation of acelebrity's likeness on souvenirs or in advertisingcampaigns. To extend the right as the Joplin heirs desirewould be to hand over to a few individuals the power tocensor a vast field of artistic expression that explores,depicts, comments on, parodies or gives homage to artistssuch as Janis Joplin who have influenced our cultureprofoundly.   Marjorie Heins   Director   American Civil Liberties Union   Arts Censorship Project   New York   ---   You correctly characterize the dispute over whether aperformer's rights to an image survive death, and note atrend in state laws protecting the right of publicityperpetually.   These state laws are of debatable constitutionality,however. The Constitution gives Congress the exclusive rightto protect the works of artists and inventors for a limitedtime. Even Congress cannot protect people from imitatorsindefinitely. While the Supreme Court has allowed states toprotect a right to publicity on the grounds that this rightis part of the right of privacy, one of the key concepts ofprivacy law is that privacy rights expire at death. TheSupreme Court has never decided whether a state can continuethe right of publicity past death.   The right of publicity can chill free speech because heirscan endorse works positive to a public figure whilesquelching those that point out that even a great person canhave flaws. This attitude can prevent much of our culturefrom becoming the basis of public debate. I'm sure this isn'twhat our country's Founders intended.   Steve Hofer   Indianapolis</TEXT></DOC>
