The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries'ministers intend to announce at their Geneva meeting, whichbegins Wednesday, production cuts that, at least on paper,will total more than one million barrels a day.</LP><TEXT>   According to people close to the organization, thereductions are likely to apply only through May and June,reflecting OPEC's effort to calm world oil markets in theface of the traditionally soft second-quarter demand. It isexpected to announce second-half production quotas at amidyear conference that begins June 25.   OPEC sources confirmed that the ministers are leaningtoward announcing a 5% cut for the two months, probablyacross-the-board. It's understood that the three big PersianGulf producers that have been producing above their quotas --Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates -- willagree to reduce output if the others make a similar, if onlysymbolic, gesture.   But the impact on the actual pace of OPEC oil output isless clear. For one thing, it isn't known if the ministersintend to figure the percentage cut against OPEC's officialfirst-half production ceiling of 22 million barrels a day oron its actual output, which has been running up to twomillion barrels a day higher.   More important, nearly half the reductions to be announcedmay have already been made. OPEC in recent weeks has beenmaking some involuntary reductions in output. The oil glut,brought on by excess OPEC production, has clogged shippingand storage facilities, and created balky buyers. Accordingto people who monitor OPEC production, members are nowpumping less than 23.5 million barrels a day, down fromMarch's 24 million barrels a day.   &quot;Markets have become swamped with Mideast crude to such anextent that producers are now unable to find buyers becausestorage tanks are simply too full to take any more,&quot; OPECListener, an industry analysis service, reported. Also, someOPEC producers are curbing output rather than offer deeperprice discounts, the service added.   Such constraints recently have trimmed as much as 200,000barrels a day off Kuwait's output and 100,000 barrels a dayfrom Saudi Arabia's production, according to industryanalysts. Some other Persian Gulf producers, such as theEmirates, have had to curtail production because of oil fieldmaintenance.   Oil markets have remained volatile, however, and some oilministers are known to be worried that a fractious OPECmeeting next week might trigger a collapse in petroleumprices, which are already down one-fourth from early thisyear.   And the outcome or conduct of an OPEC meeting is nevereasy to predict. The Geneva session isn't intended to be afull ministerial conference; it is billed only as a meetingof the committee of eight ministers who are charged withreviewing markets and making recommendations. But all 13ministers of OPEC have been invited and are expected toattend, which means the meeting could be turned into afull-blown special conference at a moment's notice.   That would open the door to discussions of any topic,including controversial ones ministers now hope to avoid, andprolong the time OPEC ministers are in the spotlight. As aresult, there is speculation that OPEC's leading members havea premeeting agreement to keep the session as short aspossible -- no more than two days -- and to avoid debate onsuch contentious topics as production quotas.   &quot;The ministers will meet the second {of May} and thethird, and it will be over,&quot; said a senior OPEC officialyesterday.</TEXT></DOC>
