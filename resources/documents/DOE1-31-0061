This paper describes thedevelopment of a Canadian design that uses electronic, acceleration-sensitivegeophones in a triaxial configuration coupled with multichannel fiber-opticsignal transmission. A high speed computer digitizes and stores the completewaveform history of all channels as events are detected. A single opticalfiber transmits triaxial information from each monitoring point.</TEXT></DOC>
