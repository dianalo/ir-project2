(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A rogue computer program designed at CornellUniversity that crippled a nationwide computer network last fallwas neither the creation of a genius nor the act of a criminal, auniversity commission has concluded.   Cornell graduate student Robert Morris alone created the programthat infected thousands of military and university computers onNov. 2, 1988, says the panel's 45-page report obtained Saturday byThe Associated Press.   Morris, 23, who is on a leave of absence from Cornell's doctoralprogram in computer science, declined to be interviewed by thecommission, which was left to speculate as to the reasons Morriscreated the ``worm.''   ``It may simply have been the unfocused intellectual meanderingsof a hacker completely absorbed with his creation and unharnessedby considerations of explicit purpose or potential effect,'' thepanel wrote.   Technically, the program was not a ``virus,'' which insertsitself into a host program to propagate; it was actually a``worm,'' or an independent program that endlessly duplicatesitself once placed in a computer system.   Cornell officials and members of the special panel werescheduled to discuss their findings at a news conference at 10 a.m.Monday.   Morris, of Arnold, Md., remains under investigation by a federalgrand jury in Syracuse and by the U.S. Justice Department inWashington, D.C.   The panel rejected the idea that Morris created the worm topoint out the need for greater computer security.   ``This was an accidental byproduct of the event and theresulting display of media interest,'' the commission wrote.``Society does not condone burglary on the grounds that itheightens concern about safety and security.''   The program could have been created by many students, graduateor undergraduate, particularly if they were aware of the Cornellsystem's well-known security flaws.   ``It is no act of genius or heroism to exploit suchweaknesses,'' the commission said.   Morris, a first-year student, should have reported the flaws hediscovered, which would ``have been the most responsible course ofaction, and one that was supported by his colleagues,'' the panelwrote.   The commission found that Morris probably wanted to spread theworm without detection, but did not want to clog the computers. Itsaid he clearly should have known the worm would replicateuncontrollably and accused Morris of ``reckless disregard'' for theconsequences.   Once the worm was unleashed, Morris made only ``minimalefforts'' to stop its spread and did not inform any person in aposition of responsibility about the existence of the program, thecommission reported.   The panel disputed industry claims that the worm caused about$96 million in damage, ``especially considering no work or datawere irretrievably lost.''   The episode's greatest impact may be a loss of trust amongscholars who use the network, which links research centers anduniversities that exchange non-classified information.   The report said computer science professionals seem to favor``strong disciplinary measures,'' but the commissison said they``should not be so stern as to damage permanently the perpetrator'scareer.''   The panel also recommended Cornell develop a universitywidepolicy on computer abuse.</TEXT></DOC>
