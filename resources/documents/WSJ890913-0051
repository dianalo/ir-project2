BellSouth shares, after surging 10 points to the 53 range between January and July, turned sluggish in recent weeks despite the summer bull market. Wall Street yawned through meetings where Bell South executives struggled to convey to investors the potential importance of the company's cellular properties.    But now BellSouth has everybody's attention. Analysts say this week's agreement to combine its cellular-phone operations with LIN's valuable properties will forge a formidable cellular empire, giving Atlanta-based BellSouth a much-needed shot in the arm.    &quot;I've always believed that about $8 to $9 a share {of BellSouth's stock price} wasn't being recognized by the marketplace,&quot; says Robert Morris II, a research vice president at Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co. &quot;Now, in essence, that will be valued by the marketplace.&quot;    In the two days since BellSouth and LIN announced their pact, BellSouth shares have risen 1 1/2, including yesterday's gain of 3/4 to 52. Many analysts expect the stock to keep climbing in the months ahead, assuming the transaction goes through.    The regional Bell companies have had a tough time getting the Street to assign top dollar to their cellular holdings. In an effort to spotlight these values, Denver-based U S West took public a piece of its cellular company, U S West NewVector. Similarly, Pacific Telesis Group in San Francisco adopted a practice of disclosing operating results of its cellular division. Now such companies are hoping some of BellSouth's new recognition will rub off on them.    &quot;BellSouth found a clever way to increase its {cellular subscribers} and a vehicle to show the true value of its cellular properties,&quot; says Kenneth Leon, a telecommunications analyst with Bear Stearns.    Of course, a higher bid for LIN by McCaw Cellular Communications or another suitor could still derail the BellSouth agreement. Some analysts suspect the proposed merger could spur McCaw to boost its unsolicited $110-a-share tender offer for the 90% of LIN it doesn't already own. New York-based LIN finished at 108 1/2 yesterday, up 1 3/4.    If all goes according to plan, BellSouth also could stand to benefit from economies of scale and lower capital costs per cellular subscriber. The reason: BellSouth and LIN plan to pool cellular resources and personnel. Geoffrey Johnson, a cellular analyst with Argus Research Corp., estimates that within three years, the resulting savings should help BellSouth post annual earnings increases of about 10%, compared with this year's growth rate of about 7%.    But the ultimate payoff for BellSouth investors could be complete ownership of the new cellular-telephone company. Under terms of the tax-free merger plan, BellSouth has the option to increase its proposed 50% stake to 75% during the first six years and eventually buy the entire company, giving it one of the largest cellular operations in the industry. &quot;That's where the real deal is,&quot; says Joel D. Gross, a vice president at Donaldson, Lufkin andamp; Jenrette Securities.    Had BellSouth sought to acquire LIN for cash, Mr. Gross figures the company's earnings would have suffered 20% dilution in the first year and the cellular operation would have needed 10 years just to break even. In contrast, he says, the plan to create a new cellular company &quot;allows BellSouth to practically double its cellular {holdings} and eventually own the company with very little dilution.&quot;    Charles W. Schelke, of Smith Barney, Harris Upham, isn't so enthusiastic. Mr. Schelke fears the company will use any excess cash to bolster its stake in the new cellular concern, instead of returning it to shareholders, perhaps in the form of higher dividends.    What's more, he contends, the transaction will lessen BellSouth's growth potential because in one sense, its cellular stake has been reduced. Under terms of the merger, LIN contributes 18 million potential customers, while BellSouth provides 28 million.    Even though BellSouth's contribution is larger, Mr. Schelke says, BellSouth gets only a 50% stake in the company, which will have 46 million potential customers. &quot;Shareholders have just given up five million {potential customers} that I valued at about $1.3 billion,&quot; he reasons. &quot;I think BellSouth paid too much.&quot;    BellSouth obviously doesn't agree. A spokeswoman for the company explains that LIN's properties are in markets with potential for faster growth.    ---   BellSouth    (NYSE; Symbol: BLS)    Business: Telephone service    Year Ended Dec. 31, 1988: Revenue: $13.60 billion    Net Income: $1.67 billion; $3.51 a share    Second quarter, June 30, 1989:    Per-share earnings: 87 cents vs. 83 cents    Average daily trading volume:    452,895 shares    Common shares outstanding: 481.3 million </TEXT></DOC>
