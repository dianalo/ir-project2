U.S. Claims Court Judge Reginald Gibson, in a ruling that has setback the government's problem-ridden nuclear waste program, saidThursday that the department could give the 10-year contract only toTRW Inc., an unsuccessful bidder that filed the December lawsuit.   The department said it was disappointed about the ruling, butstressed that the decision did not stop preliminary work todetermine the site's suitability.   The project has been beset with delays and political squabbles,stemming in part from Nevada's objection to being chosen as the sitefor the waste dump, scheduled to begin receiving radioactive cargoin 2003.   Larry Henry, press secretary for Nevada Gov. Bob Miller, said thecourt ruling ``severely weakens the DOE's credibility'' andunderscores the state's contention that the project has been guidedby politics, not science.   The proposed site at Yucca Mountain is about 100 miles northwestof Las Vegas.   Construction has not begun, and Energy Secretary James D. Watkinshas been pressing to begin geologic studies to determine whether thesite would qualify.   Leo Duffy, Watkins' chief aide on waste issues, said last monththat the department ``can't afford'' to start from scratch insoliciting bids for the contract.   Gibson's opinion was not immediately made public, but the gist ofthe decision, without explanation, was contained in a briefmemorandum to the parties in the suit.   Gibson said the opinion would be kept secret until Wednesday toallow the companies involved to review the document for proprietaryinformation or trade secrets that should not be made public.   At issue is a charge by Cleveland-based TRW that EnergyDepartment officials involved in selecting Bechtel SystemsManagement Inc. in 1988 were guilty of a conflict of interest.   TRW's contention centered on the fact that Samuel Rousso, who hada hand in selecting Bechtel, had worked for Science ApplicationsInternational Corp., a subcontractor to Bechtel. Rousso is directorof the DOE's office of civilian radioactive waste management, whichruns the project.   Under federal law, DOE supervisors can't participate in anyprojects that involve any energy concern for which they worked forup to one year after leaving that company.   Department spokeswoman Ginger King said Rousso was not availablefor comment Thursday.   Bechtel spokesman Rick Laubscher said from San Francisco thatcompany officials were ``very disappointed'' in the ruling, buthadn't seen the opinion or conferred with the DOE.   ``We have to do those things before we can speak knowledgeably onthe matter,'' Laubscher said.   Spokesmen at TRW's Cleveland and Washington, D.C., offices werenot available for comment.</TEXT></DOC>
