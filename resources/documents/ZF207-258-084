(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>By Susan JanusandM;Database giant Oracle Corp., of Belmont, Calif., recently rounded out thelist of platforms supported by the company's relational database-managementsystem (DBMS) with the release of Oracle for Macintosh.andM;The new Mac DBMS teams the power of Oracle's Structured Query Language (SQL)with HyperCard's customizable and easy-to-use interface.andM;This combination allows Mac developers to create sophisticated applicationsthat appear simple to users -- a unique software-development opportunityunavailable on any other platform, including the PC, according to earlycorporate users we contacted.andM;In addition, users said, the network version of Oracle for the Mac allows theadvantages of the HyperCard interface to serve as a front end to existingcorporate relational databases residing on other platforms, such asmainframes and minicomputers.andM;Consequently, the Mac software has great potential for success but limitedappeal, since distributed-database environments at the micro level areheavily dominated by PCs.andM;On the downside, buyers also noted, the product has limited reportingcapabilities and the inability to generate business-graphics output.andM;Oracle for Macintosh runs under MultiFinder and requires a Mac SE or II withat least 2M bytes of memory and 5M bytes of hard-disk space.andP;  HyperCard,version 1.2, is also required.andM;While the Mac database allows developers to mask the complexity of powerfuldatabase applications, buyers we contacted emphasized that it is acomplicated development environment, particularly for programmers who lackSQL programming experience.andM;''This is not a product for the casual user.andP;  It's a tool for seriousdatabase building,'' said Steve Mitchell, director of product development forDesign Technologies Inc., a New York software-development and consulting firmthat specializes in custom software for facilities and space management.andM;The Mac software contains the kernel of Oracle's relational DBMS.andP;  At $199,the stand-alone version is a cheap ticket for the uninitiated into the worldof SQL and relational-database management.andM;However, the product's chief mandate is to provide developers with a tool forintegrating Macs into corporate distributed-database environments.andP;  Seriousdevelopers then will want the $999 network version, which essentially rendersthe Oracle kernel on the Mac useless, because the network version is designedto link with a database running on a multiuser system.andM;The network version contains SQL*Net -- the generic, peer-to-peer networkinterface for linking one Oracle database platform to another.andP;  It alsocontains three communications protocols: asynchronous, DECNet and TCP/IP.andM;A word of caution: The Mac running Oracle cannot be used as a databaseserver.andP;  It is restricted to the role of client machine.andP;  To integrate a Macinto a networked database environment, there must be a multiuser operatingsystem, such as VAX/VMS, to support the shared Oracle database, said SethLefferts, Macintosh systems manager for Spectra-Tech Inc., a Stamford, Conn.,andO;company that sells accessories for scientific instruments.andM;Consequently, networks consisting solely of Macs on AppleTalk cannot gain thebenefits of a distributed-database environment using Oracle for Macintosh.andM;According to many buyers, Oracle for Macintosh is particularly useful indeveloping database-management systems to connect departmental Macs to largersystems.andP;  Jeff Menz, a systems analyst for a scientific R and D organization,is currently using Oracle for Macintosh to develop a system that will givethe company's numerous Mac users access to an Oracle database running on aVAX.andP;  Using the networking version, Menz will link departmental AppleTalknetworks to the VAX over a TCP/IP network.andM;Oracle Provides the GroundworkandM;The key benefit of Oracle's product is that ''all the fundamental technicalwork -- the protocols, the compatibility with the AppleTalk network -- hasbeen done by Oracle,'' Menz said.andP;  ''I just have to build the HyperCardinterface and do the database design work.''andM;The result will be an Oracle relational-database application on the VAX witha HyperCard front end that Mac users feel comfortable with, he explained.andO;Also, the company will have one logical relational database instead ofnumerous fragmented local databases.andP;  This allows tighter security, improveddata integrity and better performance, he added.andM;For reporting purposes, Menz and other users agreed, the product is limited,and its reliance on HyperCard for reporting capabilities is a shortcoming.andO;''I prepare my reports on the VAX,'' Menz said.andM;Oracle for Macintosh is also useful for developing custom executiveinformation systems, many users noted.andM;According to Philip Allsopp, a principal with Resource Deployment StrategiesInc. (RDSI) in Princeton, N.J., the PC interface is inadequate for the systemRDSI is developing to assist hospital administrators and planners.andP;  CalledSynopsis, RDSI's system will pull together data from disparate hospitaldatabases and present it to administrators in the form of graphicallyrepresented information -- as opposed to raw data -- that can be used forsophisticated market analysis and facilities planning, Allsopp explained.andM;Synopsis is designed for non-technical users, he said.andP;  The HyperCardinterface -- which displays a direct representation of database queries --effectively allows developers ''to bury all SQL code behind push-buttons,''Allsopp said.andM;Oracle for Macintosh boasts two features that lend themselves especially wellto the development of an executive-information system such as Synopsis,Allsopp said.andM;First, developers using Oracle for the Mac can work not only within theHyperCard programming environment -- from which Oracle commands and functionscan be performed -- but also with the more powerful set of programming toolscontained in the Macintosh Programmer's Workshop.andM;Using the Programmer's Workshop, RDSI developers can write the long commandfiles needed for complex, multiple database searches, Allsopp said.andM;Second, Oracle for Macintosh's SQL*Loader utility offers developers speed andflexibility when moving external files in many different formats into anOracle database.andM;This flexibility is key for Synopsis, Allsopp said, because selected hospitaldata will be pulled off various systems onto nine-track, reel-to-reel tapeand loaded into Oracle database tables.andP;  The database will be updated on aweekly or monthly basis, he added.andM;Oracle for Macintosh is the final piece in the Oracle database puzzle.andO;Although the software is a good fit for corporations trying to integrate Macsinto their database environments, it is not a product for the broader base ofMacintosh database users.andM;Oracle for MacintoshandM;DBMS Brings New Power and Face to Mac Application DevelopmentandM;WHAT CORPORATE BUYERS LIKEandM;-- Offers SQL capabilitiesandM;-- Uses HyperCard to mask complexity of database applicationsandM;-- Serves as front end to relational databases on other platformsandM;-- Can link different Oracle database platforms with network versionandM;-- Provides good documentation and supportandM;WHAT CORPORATE BUYERS DISLIKEandM;-- Lacks extensive reporting capabilitiesandM;-- Cannot generate business-graphic output</TEXT></DOC>
