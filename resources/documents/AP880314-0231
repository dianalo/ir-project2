A distinct class of the poor people _ 2,000 to 3,000 people _had taken shape in and around the dump since it first opened in the1940s and picking trash provided a livelihood for them. It grewinto a tightly knit society regulated by a dump boss _ Pablo TellezFalcon being the most recent _ and outsiders were unwelcome.   Now, the city government says, the trash pickers will be movedto homes with electricity and plumbing near a new but temporarydump, and Santa Fe will become a park.   But the plan leaves trash pickers with mixed feelings andsomewhat concerned about the future.   The foul-smelling dump, spread over about 150 acres on thewestern edge of Mexico City, was one of the largest in LatinAmerica and the last of the big open-air sites to be shut down bythe Mexico City government.   ``This dump became an air pollution and public health problem,''the city said in a news release announcing the project.   Under an ambitious plan, the city began a year ago to level,compact and seal the solid wastes at the Santa Fe site. The garbagewas estimated to be 230 feet deep in some places, forming enormouscliffs from the refuse deposited there for more than four decades.   Homero Aridjis, a poet and president of the Group of 100environmental activists, said the project ``is important becausethe garbage is not only a pollution problem but also a socialproblem.''   The Mexico City metropolitan area, the world's largest with 18million people, is considered by experts to have the world's worstair pollution.   The Santa Fe dump, releasing bacteria into the air, posed ahealth hazard to the trash pickers (``pepenadores,'' or scavengers,in Spanish) and residents of surrounding neighborhoods, some of thecity's wealthiest.   Spontaneous fires often broke out, sending noxious fumes intothe air. There also was concern the wastes were seeping intoaquifers and contaminating the city's already scarce water supply.   Much of the trash has been covered over, but many pickers stilllive in their shacks amid the fly-covered refuse that remains atSanta Fe.   Nearby, the city has opened the other dump, Prados de laMontana, where some 2,500 tons a day of trash are unloaded. Thatsite will be used, however, for just five years.   The Santa Fe pickers will be moved in the coming months andoffered new houses outside the Prados de la Montana dump. Thenearby Tlayapaca housing project, which will provide 510 two- andthree-bedroom houses, with water, electricity and drainage systems,is to be completed in May.   ``With this action, the social evolution of that group of peoplewill be achieved, improving their conditions of health andwell-being and, as a result, their quality of life,'' thegovernment said.   Apolonia Martinez de Correa, whose family flattens milk cartons,stuffs them into plastic bags and sells them for recycling, saidshe would be glad to live in a cleaner place but is not so sureabout moving from Santa Fe.   ``There is not as much pollution. There are not as many flies,''she said of living somewhere else.   But she expressed sadness at being forced out of a place thathas been the family home since the area became a dump and concernabout where her family would move.   She said she had been told the new houses would cost 2 millionto 3 million pesos apiece (about $870 to $1,300), a sum the familycannot afford.   ``We will have to go somewhere else,'' she said.   However, Alejandro Rodriguez Cortez, chief of information forthe city government, said the residents would have to pay only forwater, electricity and other public services in the new homes.   Mrs. Martinez de Correa earns 80 pesos _ less than five cents _for a 2.2-pound bag of paper. A week's work, she said, is worth50,000 pesos or about $22. The government-set minimum wage is 8,000pesos a day, or about $3.50.   As she talked to a reporter, several of her 10 children satnearby. A young boy played with a dirt-encrusted fruit pit. Twosmall girls, their faces and clothes covered with grime, listenedquietly.   Behind them, several of the stray dogs that roam the dump inpacks scratched for scraps among flattened milk cartons waiting tobe bagged.   Over the years, some of Santa Fe's residents arranged theirshacks, made of the metal cut from oil drums, in rows, formingstreets and some order in their lives. Their children studied at aprimary school and took part in sports events on the weekends.   About 200 families have already moved out of Santa Fe to housingfarther away from the sites, residents said. Some return to work atthe new dump, but others are trying to find different jobs.   Under new rules, the garbage pickers are allowed to enter thePrados de la Montana dump and pick trash from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m.daily, separating glass and plastic from paper and tin. They can'tlive there, and small children and pregnant women will be refusedentry for health reasons.   After the workers leave at night, the unpicked rubbish isflattened and covered with dirt to prevent contamination.   ``It's controlled,'' said Hector Javier Samano, a projectengineer with the city`s Urban Services Department. ``There are noflies, there is no smell.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Mon PMs March 21</NOTE></DOC>
