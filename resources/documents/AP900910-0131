Cavazos said a new analysis of student loan data showed morethan 30 percent of all defaulted loans _ $365 million _ was owed byborrowers who attended less than 1 percent of the nation's 10,000postsecondary institutions. The borrowers were to begin repayingtheir guaranteed student loans two years ago.   The majority of the 60 schools are technical trade or vocationalinstitutions that are accredited by seven of the nation's more than100 accrediting agencies.   Cavazos originally targeted 89 institutions but 28 have closedand one, the USA Training Academy, Home Study of Delaware, isinactive because it no longer receives federal funds.   Cavazos said the federal advisory committee that overseesaccrediting agencies has been directed to scrutinize the policiesof the seven agencies.   The secretary's latest action comes as the Education Departmentstruggles to keep afloat the Higher Education AssistanceFoundation, a private, non-profit agency based in Overland Park,Kan., which is the guarantor of $8.8 billion in students loans, ormore than 17 percent of the $51 billion student loans outstandingnationally.   The total of student loan defaults is $7.8 billion, of which$1.9 billion was added last year. An estimated $12 billion will beloaned to some 5 million students during the 1990 fiscal year.   The federal advisory panel, the National Advisory Committee onAccreditation and Institutional Eligibility, recommends to thesecretary which accrediting agencies should be recognized. Theagencies in turn accredit schools so they can participate infederal student aid programs.   Cavazos directed Leonard Haynes III, assistant secretary forpostsecondary education, to meet with heads of the accreditingagencies and urge them to review their policies and procedures forinstitutional accreditation.   ``It is reasonable to expect that the level of student loandefaults at a school is related to the quality of its program,''said Cavazos. ``I am convinced that any accrediting agency thattakes its role seriously must focus on educational effectivenessand must be concerned that institutions with high default rates areheld accountable.''   The accrediting agencies are The Accrediting Bureau of HealthEducation Schools; The Accrediting Council for Continuing Educationand Training; The Association of Independent Colleges and Schools,Accrediting Commission; The National Accrediting Commission ofCosmetology Arts and Sciences; The National Association of Tradeand Technical Schools, Accrediting Commission; The National HomeStudy Council, Accrediting Council; and the Southern Association ofColleges and Schools, Commission on Occupational EducationInstitutions.   Cavazos said the department is conducting program oradministration review of the 89 institutions that remain open.   The highest default institutions included Cambridge TechnicalInstitute, Dayton, Ohio, with an 81.5 percent default rateamounting to $8.3 million; and Sawyer College, Cleveland Heights,Ohio, with a 79.9 percent default rate amounting to $1.8 million.   Also Metils Welding School, Houston, Texas, with a 69 percentrate at $4.1 million; the Vocational Training Center, St. Louis,Mo., with a 68 percent rate at $3.7 million, and Tarkio College inTarkio, Mo., with a 67.3 percent rate totaling $4.3 million.</TEXT></DOC>
