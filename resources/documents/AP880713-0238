Keoghs are sometimes thought of as the province of professionalson the upper rungs of the income ladder.   But in fact, they can play a useful role in tax and retirementplanning for anyone who has self-employment income _ includingmoonlighters who are covered by a separate pension plan at theirprimary job.   The Tax Reform Act of 1986 put limits on deductions forcontributions to individual retirement accounts if you are coveredby a pension plan. But it set no such constraints for Keoghs.   In many ways, Keoghs are very similar to IRAs. Both are accountsset up with a custodian that allow you to make annual contributions.   As the money grows, the interest, dividends or capital gains itearns can compound tax-free until withdrawals begin, at age 59{ orlater if you want to avoid a 10 percent penalty tax.   But while IRA contributions are limited to $2,000 a year perperson, the maximum for Keoghs can run as high as $30,000.   Keoghs originated in the early 1960s (they are named for VincentKeogh, a New York congressman who sponsored the bill that createdthem).   Nowadays, they come in several forms. One, known as a ``moneypurchase'' plan, permits you to contribute as much as 20 percent ofyour self-employment income annually, up to the $30,000 ceiling.   For a second type, known as a ``profit-sharing'' plan, themaximum percentage is 13.043, again with the $30,000 cap.   The difference in percentage limits naturally prompts manypeople to opt for a money-purchase plan.   But there is another point to be considered in making thechoice. Once you have set a given percentage contribution to amoney-purchase plan, you are required to keep making thatcontribution each year.   ``Your profit-sharing contribution, on the other hand, isoptional,'' notes Albert Ellentuck at the accounting firm ofLaventhol andamp; Horwath. ``If you need your money for other purposes,you're not obliged to contribute it.''   Adds Michael Leonetti, a Buffalo Grove, Ill., financial planner,writing in the current edition of the American Association ofIndividual Investors' AAII Journal: ``This is a dramatic advantageover the money purchase arrangement, because of its flexibility.''   Ellentuck notes that a compromise option, known as a ``pairedplan,'' can be set up that is part money purchase and partprofit-sharing.   Still another variation, called a defined benefit plan, can beset up to pay out a predetermined amount each year after you retire.   These are most likely to be a good choice for people fairlyclose to retirement, Leonetti says, while younger savers usuallywill come out best with a plan covered by the annual contributionlimits.   Keoghs can be managed conservatively, aggressively or somewherein between in just about any kind of financial investment _ bankcertificates of deposit, mutual funds, stocks and so forth.   You cannot, however, put your Keogh money in collectibles suchas rare coins or antiques. ``The legislators wanted to keeptaxpayers from using their retirement dollars to furnish theirhomes,'' Ellentuck observes.   If you are the sort that distrusts paper investments, Keoghsavers are permitted to buy precious metals coins issued by theU.S. government.   When it comes time to start withdrawing from a Keogh account,you'll owe taxes on the money you take out. Even then, though, youcan avail yourself of another break known as five-year forwardaveraging.   ``When you take out your funds in one lump sum, you average yourtaxes over five years rather than pay one enormous tax on the fullamount,'' Ellentuck points out. ``That's a considerable tax break.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv PMs Thursday July 14</NOTE></DOC>
