Shevardnadze says a newparliament now being formed should debate foreign policy issues inorder to prevent the kind of closed-door decision making that sentSoviet troops into Afghanistan.   In an interview published Wednesday by the government newspaperIzvestiya, Shevardnadze said, ``I foresee the time when open debateson some or other international problems will become naturalpractice.''   ``High officials of the Foreign Ministry, the minister included,will be giving answers to informal questions from deputies, whenreferendums and public opinion polls will be held before takingfundamental decisions,'' he said.   The Soviet policy of glasnost, or greater openness on someissues, has affected mainly internal issues. Dissent on questions offoreign policy has only recently surfaced in the media.   The Congress of People's Deputies is being formed now. It willconsist of 750 representatives of the Communist Party, itsaffiliates, professsional and social organizations, and 1,500members elected from geographical districts.   Voting for geographical districts will take place Sunday, but theorganizations are electing their deputies now. The congress willthen choose from among its members a new Supreme Soviet parliament.   Shevardnadze said the new parliament, by serving as a forum forforeign policy debates, could bring about ``new forms of glasnost inforeign policy and diplomacy,'' Shevardnadze said.   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, who launched the currentreorganization, also says the new legislature must take a greaterrole in setting policy.   Under the Soviet Constitution, any decision to use armed forcesabroad must be sanctioned by the Supreme Soviet, Shevardnadze said.   Top Soviet officials have criticized the process that led to theAfghanistan intervention in 1979, saying a narrow group of peoplemade the decision without consulting anyone.   The Soviet Union pulled its remaining troops out of Afghanistanlast month after nine years of war and an estimated 15,000 dead.</TEXT></DOC>
