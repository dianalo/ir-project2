The amendment preserves a 1977 law, the CommunityReinvestment Act, which was stripped down in a subcommitteedraft of the bill last month. The law requires federalregulators to scrutinize a bank's record on lending in poorerneighborhoods when a bank requests government permission fornew branches or mergers. The aim is to spur lending to poorpeople.</LP><TEXT>   Last month, the subcommittee approved two amendments toexempt roughly 80% of the industry from keeping such records,and those quickly became a lightning rod for opposition tothe entire bill.   In addition, the bill would allow banks to underwriteinsurance and securities for the first time, and it wouldrecapitalize the nearly insolvent bank insurance fund.   Yesterday, about 90 demonstrators opposed to theexemption, who rode buses from Chicago and St. Louis, triedto squeeze into the hearing room. Many committee members saidthat they had received more reaction -- mostly negative --from constituents on the amendments exempting banks from theCommunity Reinvestment Act than on any other part of thebanking bill.   &quot;I have been subjected to intense emotional protests inthe district and in the press,&quot; said Rep. Marge Roukema (R.,N.J.). The intent of the earlier amendment, she said, wassimply to &quot;target&quot; the record-keeping requirement towardbanks where it would have the greatest impact.   This week, Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady made a pointof telling reporters that the Bush administration had no rolein drafting the subcommittee amendments, even though theywere popular with bankers. &quot;We didn't have anything to dowith that,&quot; Mr. Brady said. Banking trade groups have lobbiedfor a curtailment of the community reinvestment law, citingthe record-keeping costs.   Under a compromise, which went through six drafts behindclosed doors before being presented to committee members, theearlier law was restored by a 40-12 vote.   In exchange, another amendment that had been approved willbe dropped. It would have applied the community reinvestmentlaw to banks seeking to sell insurance or securities.&quot;Believe me,&quot; said Rep. Joseph Kennedy (D., Mass.), &quot;we willcome back and try to win this amendment on the House floor.&quot;   Despite killing Mr. Kennedy's amendment, bankersconsidered the reinstatement of the community lendingstandards a big blow. Lee Peckarsky, lobbyist for theNational Council of Savings Institutions, said the bankerswill continue to fight to scale back the law. &quot;This wascertainly near the top of our priority list,&quot; he said. &quot;Butthis is a long process, where there has to be a lot of giveand take.&quot;   The committee yesterday also amended the bill to requireregulators to take control of a bank or thrift no later thansix months after its capital, a cushion against losses, fallsbelow 2% of assets. Committee members, citing the costs ofyears of inaction by thrift regulators, defeated a substituteamendment, sponsored by Rep. John LaFalce (D., N.Y.), on a28-21 vote. It would have permitted regulators to keep a bankopen in certain circumstances, even if its capital was below2%.   &quot;Either we are going to have early intervention or we'renot,&quot; said Rep. Bruce Vento (D., Minn.). &quot;This is a greaterloophole.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
