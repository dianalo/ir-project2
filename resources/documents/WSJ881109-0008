The referendums were only two of the scores of initiatives, propositions, amendments and bond issues that appeared on ballots in 41 states. But the Florida and Maryland questions, along with a vote aimed at closing nuclear-power plants in Massachusetts, had generated interest nationwide.    In Florida, with 34% of the vote tallied, voters rejected Amendment 10 by 57% to 43%. The amendment would have placed a $100,000 cap on non-economic, or &quot;pain and suffering,&quot; losses in all types of liability cases ranging from medical malpractice to automobile accidents to product-liability suits. Twenty-eight states have some type of cap on non-economic damages, but none with a limit as low as the $100,000 proposed in Florida, which has experienced a large number of big jury verdicts and high medical-malpractice insurance costs.    The fight over the amendment included large media campaigns by the state's lawyers, who generally opposed the proposal, and doctors, who supported it.    Also in Florida, voters approved by a wide margin a proposal to make English the official language of the state. A coalition of civic leaders, civil libertarians and Hispanic groups had gone to federal court in an unsuccessful attempt to knock the amendment off the ballot.    With the steady flow of Hispanic immigrants into the state, the concept of an official language enjoyed widespread popular support, especially in northern Florida. Backers of the amendment had denied that they were trying to limit First Amendment rights.    Voters in Colorado and Arizona also were to decide whether to make English the official language in their states.    In Maryland, meanwhile, with 82% of the precincts reporting, about 58% voted to uphold the gun-control law. The law, passed last April, established a board appointed by the governor to prepare a list of handguns that could be sold in the state, with the aim being to ban cheap handguns used by criminals. Pro-gun groups in the state, backed by the National Rifle Association, collected enough petition signatures to force the referendum. All told, the pro-gun groups spent more than $6 million in their attempts to overturn the law.    In Massachusetts, voters apparently rejected a referendum to shut down the state's two nuclear-power plants by banning the operation of any power plant that generates nuclear waste.    The two nuclear plants in the state are Boston Edison Co.'s Pilgrim plant in Plymouth and the Yankee plant in Rowe, which is owned by a consortium of 10 New England utilities.    During the past few months, anti-nuclear groups argued that the plants ought to be closed for safety reasons while referendum opponents, including major utilities, maintained that plant closures would deprive the region of much needed power. Furthermore, they contend, shutdowns would be tantamount to confiscation of private property by the state. </TEXT></DOC>
