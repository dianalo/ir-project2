Each reactor is operated in an optimum temperature range to maximize      methanol productivity, and once-through product conversion of up to 9.1      moles methanol per 100 moles of synthesis gas can be achieved with      reasonable catalyst utilization. Overall catalyst utilization is increased      by countercurrent catalyst transfer. In an alternate mode of operation,      the liquid phase reactor system is integrated with a coal gasification      combined cycle (CGCC) power generation process wherein the unreacted      synthesis gas is used as fuel in a gas turbine-driven electric power      generator. Operation of each liquid phase reactor in the optimum      temperature range maximizes the available heat of reaction which is      recovered as steam; the steam is utilized in the gas turbine combustor or      the CGCC steam turbine. Methanol from the liquid phase reactor system can      be used as peak shaving fuel for the gas turbine. </PAL></ABST><BSUM> <PAC>  FIELD OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  This invention pertains to the production of methanol from synthesis gas,      and in particular to the production of methanol in a staged liquid phase      reactor system. </PAR><PAC>  BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  Methanol is produced commercially from synthesis gas comprising hydrogen,      carbon monoxide, and carbon dioxide by contacting the synthesis gas with a      solid methanol synthesis catalyst in one or more gas phase synthesis      reactors. Most of the world's methanol is produced by this reaction route      utilizing the well-known Lurgi and ICI methanol synthesis processes. An      improved methanol synthesis process which utilizes powdered catalyst mixed      with an inert liquid, known as the liquid phase methanol process, is      disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,888,896, 4,031,123, and 4,567,204. This      process operates more efficiently than the gas phase process because the      heat of reaction is absorbed by the inert liquid thus allowing closer      temperature control in the reactor; heat is removed from the inert liquid      in a separate cooling step. As a result of closer temperature control, a      higher per pass conversion to methanol can be achieved with the liquid      phase process than with conventional gas phase reactor systems. The liquid      phase methanol process can utilize a much wider range of synthesis gas      compositions than gas phase processes, and is particularly useful for      CO-rich synthesis gas such as that produced by the coal gasification      processes. Further improvement in operating efficiency and methanol yield      in the liquid phase process can be realized by using multiple stages as      disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,766,154, the specification and drawings of      which are incorporated herein by reference. This process utilizes a      two-stage slurry reactor system which is operated such that a specific      reaction mechanism occurs in each reactor; in the first stage reactor, the      operation is controlled to favor the hydrogenation of carbon monoxide,      while in the second stage reactor the operation is controlled to favor the      hydrogenation of carbon dioxide. The staged process results in substantial      increases in methanol yield over a single-stage liquid phase process. The      staged process comprises feeding synthesis gas containing hydrogen, carbon      monoxide, and carbon dioxide into the first stage reactor, withdrawing a      stream containing methanol and unreacted synthesis gas components, cooling      the stream and recovering methanol product therefrom, passing the      unreacted synthesis gas components into the second stage reactor, and      recovering additional methanol product from the second stage reactor      effluent stream. Unreacted synthesis gas components are recycled to the      inlet of the second stage reactor. Heat is removed from the inert liquid      of each reactor by withdrawing a portion of the inert liquid as a slurry,      cooling the slurry in an external heat exchanger, and pumping the cooled      slurry back into the reactor. </PAR><PAR>  U.S. Pat. No. 2,467,802 discloses a staged, gas-phase fluidized bed process      for converting synthesis gas containing hydrogen and carbon oxides into      hydrocarbons and oxygenated organic compounds. The process comprises      passing synthesis gas upward through a series of fluidized catalyst beds,      forming product components in each of the beds, and withdrawing product      and unreacted synthesis gas from the last stage reactor. The volume and      diameter of each reactor stage decreases in the direction of gas flow.      Fresh catalyst is introduced into the last stage reactor and is partially      spent therein; the catalyst then flows through one or more additional beds      in series in a countercurrent direction to the synthesis gas flow, and      finally spent catalyst is removed from the first stage reactor.      Preferably, reaction products are removed from the gas stream between each      stage and the unreacted synthesis gas is passed into the next stage. Heat      is removed from each stage by a cooling coil installed in each reactor. As      a result of the countercurrent flow of gas and catalyst, and the changing      of the sizes of the reactor stages in the direction of gas flow, the      optimum conditions of pressure, temperature, and gas velocities may be      approximately the same in all reactor stages. </PAR><PAR>  U.S. Pat. No. 2,852,350 discloses a reactor for the production of      hydrocarbons from hydrogen and carbon monoxide in a slurry reactor in      accordance with the Fisher-Tropsch process. The reactor consists of a      pressure vessel containing a multiple number of internal vertical bundles      of cooling tubes wherein the bundles are arranged such that the effective      number of tubes and thus the effective heat transfer surface area      decreases in the direction of gas flow. Gas flows upward through a      catalyst slurry on the shell side of the tubes while coolant flows within      the tubes. </PAR><PAR>  A medium-load power generating plant with an integrated coal gasification      plant is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,608,818. During periods of low power      requirements excess synthesis gas is converted to methanol in parallel      gas-phase methanol synthesis reactors. One of these methanol synthesis      reactors is operated in a once-through mode and the unreacted synthesis      gas is returned to the plant synthesis gas handling system. In the      remaining methanol synthesis reactors the unreacted synthesis gas is      recycled as reactor feed. </PAR><PAR>  U.S. Pat. No. 4,665,688 discloses a power generating plant with an      integrated coal gasification plant which produces synthesis gas, one      portion of which is fired in a gas turbine power generation system and the      remainder of which is used to produce methanol and other chemical products      such as acetic acid. Unreacted synthesis gas from the methanol and acetic      acid reactors is utilized for gas turbine fuel. </PAR><PAR>  U.S. Pat. No. 4,946,477, the specification and drawings of which are      incorporated herein by reference, discloses an improved integrated coal      gasification combined cycle power generation process including      once-through methanol production from the synthesis gas provided by the      gasifier. Unreacted synthesis gas is utilized in a gas turbine generator      to produce power. The improvement comprises utilizing a liquid phase      methanol synthesis reaction system, a portion of the unreacted synthesis      gas from which is separated into a hydrogen-rich stream and a CO-rich      stream; the CO-rich stream is used as gas turbine fuel. The remainder of      the unreacted synthesis gas is combined with the hydrogen-rich stream,      CO.sub.2 is removed from the combined stream, and the resulting stream      feeds a gas-phase methanol reactor to produce additional methanol.      Unreacted synthesis gas from this reactor is used as gas turbine fuel. </PAR><PAR>  The liquid phase reaction process is an efficient method for the production      of methanol from synthesis gas, and particularly CO-rich synthesis gas.      When synthesis gas is obtained by gasifying coal, the composition of the      gas may vary over time due to changes in coal feedstock properties and      gasifier operating conditions. In particular, the concentration of certain      compounds which reduce the activity of the catalyst may change with time,      thus in turn affecting the optimum operation of the process. Changes in      the relative amounts of hydrogen and carbon oxides in the synthesis gas      further affect the optimum operation of the process. The present invention      as disclosed and claimed below addresses these problems and teaches an      improved method of operating liquid phase methanol reactors and      integrating the reactors with a coal gasification combined cycle power      generation system. </PAR><PAC>  SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  The present invention is a process for the production of methanol from      synthesis gas comprising hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and carbon dioxide by      reaction in a series of at least two liquid phase methanol reactors. The      synthesis gas is introduced into a first liquid phase reactor which      contains a solid methanol synthesis catalyst in an inert liquid, and      methanol is produced therein. An effluent gas stream comprising methanol,      hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and carbon dioxide is withdrawn from the first      reactor and introduced into a second liquid phase reactor which contains      the same type of solid methanol synthesis catalyst in the same type of      inert liquid, wherein additional methanol is produced, and a mixed product      stream is withdrawn from the second reactor. Heat is removed from the      first and second liquid phase reactors to control the respective      temperatures therein such that the methanol productivity is maximized for      a given composition of the synthesis gas feed and the given activity of      the catalyst in each of the reactors. This heat is removed by indirect      heat exchange with synthesis gas feed, steam, or boiler feedwater in a      first and a second heat exchanger located respectively within the first      and second reactors. </PAR><PAR>  Catalyst inventory and activity are maintained in the reactors by      withdrawing spent catalyst from the first liquid phase reactor,      transferring partially spent catalyst from the second liquid phase reactor      to the first liquid phase reactor, and introducing fresh catalyst into the      second liquid phase reactor. Alternately, fresh catalyst can be introduced      individually into a given reactor and spent catalyst can be withdrawn      individually from the given reactor. </PAR><PAR>  Vaporized inert liquid in the mixed product stream is condensed, separated,      and recycled to the first and second reactors. The mixed product stream,      essentially free of vaporized inert liquid, is further separated into a      crude methanol product and unreacted synthesis gas components comprising      hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and carbon dioxide. </PAR><PAR>  An alternate mode of the invention is an integrated process for the      coproduction of methanol and electric power in a coal gasification      combined cycle system. Coal is gasified to produce a crude synthesis gas      comprising hydrogen, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, sulfur-containing      impurities, and particulates; the sulfur-containing impurities and      particulates are removed to yield a synthesis gas feed comprising      hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and carbon dioxide. A first portion of the      synthesis gas feed is introduced into a first liquid phase reactor      containing a solid methanol synthesis catalyst in an inert liquid wherein      the first portion of synthesis gas feed reacts in the presence of the      catalyst to produce methanol. A sufficient amount of heat is removed from      the first liquid phase reactor to control the temperature therein such      that the methanol productivity is maximized for a given composition of      synthesis gas feed and a given activity of the catalyst. This sufficient      amount of heat is removed by indirect heat exchange between boiler      feedwater and the inert liquid thereby generating a first stream of steam.      An effluent gas stream comprising methanol, hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and      carbon dioxide is withdrawn from the first liquid phase reactor and is      introduced into a second liquid phase reactor containing the same types of      methanol synthesis catalyst and inert liquid as in the first reactor, and      the effluent gas stream reacts in the presence of the catalyst to produce      additional methanol. A sufficient amount of heat is removed from the      reactor to control the temperature therein such that the methanol      productivity is maximized for a given composition of the effluent gas      stream and a given activity of the catalyst. This sufficient amount of      heat is removed by indirect heat exchange between boiler feedwater and the      inert liquid thereby generating a second stream of steam. </PAR><PAR>  A mixed product stream comprising methanol, hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and      carbon dioxide is withdrawn from the second liquid phase reactor and is      separated into a crude methanol product and a stream of unreacted      synthesis gas comprising hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and carbon dioxide. A      second portion of the synthesis gas feed is combined with at least a      portion of the unreacted synthesis gas and the combined stream is      introduced into the combustor of a gas turbine-driven electric generator      which is part of the coal gasification combined cycle system, thereby      generating electric power. Energy from the first and second streams of      steam is recovered by injecting the steam into one or more subsystems of      the coal gasification combined cycle system, namely the gas turbine      combustor, the steam turbine, and a utility steam system. At least a      portion of the crude methanol product is utilized as fuel in the gas      turbine combustor. </PAR><PAR>  The invention is also a reactor system for the production of methanol from      synthesis gas feed containing hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and carbon      dioxide which includes a first reactor comprising a first vessel      containing a solid methanol synthesis catalyst in an inert liquid; means      for introducing a synthesis gas feed stream into the first vessel; means      for introducing the solid methanol synthesis catalyst and the inert liquid      into the first vessel; means for withdrawing an effluent gas stream from      the first vessel; means for withdrawing at least a portion of the solid      methanol synthesis catalyst and inert liquid from the first vessel; first      heat exchange means for removing heat from the contents of the first      vessel; and first control means to regulate the amount of heat removed      from the contents of the first vessel in order to control the temperature      therein at a predetermined value. The reactor system further includes a      second reactor comprising a second vessel containing the same solid      methanol synthesis catalyst in the same inert liquid; means for      transferring the effluent gas stream from the first vessel into the second      vessel; means for introducing the solid methanol synthesis catalyst and      the inert liquid into the second vessel; means for withdrawing a mixed      product gas stream from the second vessel; means for withdrawing at least      a portion of the solid methanol synthesis catalyst and the inert liquid      from the second vessel; means for transferring at least a portion of the      solid methanol synthesis catalyst and the inert liquid from the second      vessel to the first vessel; second heat exchange means for removing heat      from the contents of the second vessel; and second control means to      regulate the amount of heat removed from the contents of the second vessel      in order to control the temperature therein at a predetermined value. </PAR><PAR>  Several advantages are realized in the present invention compared with      prior art liquid phase methanol processes. First, because of the      efficiency of staged operation, a significant increase in methanol      production per unit of synthesis gas feed is obtained. Second, the      catalyst utilization is improved, which increases the amount of methanol      produced per unit of catalyst consumption compared with a single-stage      reactor system. In addition, methanol losses in the unreacted synthesis      gas (stream 77, FIG. 1 or stream 514, FIG. 3) are reduced because the flow      rate of this stream is lower than the corresponding stream in a      single-stage system. Further, the methanol concentration in the final      reactor effluent (stream 505, FIG. 3) is higher for the two-stage      operation than the single-stage operation, which allows higher product      recovery. In the alternate mode of the invention, the total amount of      available energy recovered from the first and second liquid phase reactors      for utilization in the coal gasification combined cycle system is      maximized by operating each of the liquid phase reactors in a temperature      range which maximizes methanol productivity. </PAR></BSUM><DRWD> <PAC>  BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS </PAC><PAR>  FIG. 1 is a flow diagram for the process of the present invention. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 2 is a simplified flow diagram for a single-stage liquid phase      methanol process. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 3 is a simplified flow diagram for the process of the present      invention. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 4 is a plot of methanol productivity vs reactor temperature for each      stage of the reactor system of the present invention. </PAR></DRWD><DETD> <PAC>  DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  Synthesis gas containing hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and carbon dioxide can      be produced by the gasification of coal, by partial oxidation of      hydrocarbons, or by steam reforming of light gaseous hydrocarbons. The      process of the present invention can operate successfully over a wide      range of synthesis gas feed compositions typical of such processes, and is      particularly well-suited for the production of methanol from syngas having      a high CO concentration obtained from coal gasification processes such as      those developed by Texaco, Shell, and others. </PAR><PAR>  A schematic flowsheet for the process of the present invention is shown in      FIG. 1. Synthesis gas feed comprising hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and      carbon dioxide which is essentially free of solid particles and      sulfur-containing compounds flows through lines 1 and 2, is compressed to      between about 300 and 500 psig in compressor 102, and is cooled to between      80.degree. and 120.degree. F. in cooler 104. The compressed gas flows      through line 6 into carbonyl guard bed 106 in which most of the iron and      nickel carbonyl compounds, which poison the methanol synthesis catalyst,      are removed. The syngas then flows through line 8 and is further      compressed in second stage compressor 108 to between about 500 and 1500      psig. Optionally, at least a portion of compressed syngas stream 10, now      between about 250.degree. and 350.degree. F., flows as stream 11 to heat      exchanger 110 where it is further heated by indirect heat exchange with      hot effluent stream 48 from separator 126. Stream 12 from exchanger 110 is      combined with the remainder of stream 10 to form combined stream 13 which      is further heated in heat exchanger 112. Syngas feed now at a temperature      between about 325.degree. and 430.degree. F. passes through line 14 and      into sulfur guard bed 114 in which hydrogen sulfide and carbonyl sulfide      are adsorbed. Syngas feed finally passes through line 16 and into the      first stage liquid phase methanol reactor 116. Water is optionally added      to the reactor feed through line 18, which is particularly useful when the      synthesis gas is high in CO. CO.sub.2 is optionally added to the feed gas      through line 4, which is particularly useful when the synthesis gas is low      in CO.sub.2. Liquid phase methanol reactor 116 contains a slurry of a      powdered methanol synthesis catalyst suspended in an inert liquid; a      commercial catalyst such as BASF S3-86 containing copper and zinc oxide on      alumina can be used. The inert liquid can be selected from a number of      commercially available organic liquids and hydrocarbon mineral oils,      particularly those with a high paraffinic and/or naphthenic content.      Preferred commercial products include Drakeol-10 sold by Penreco and      Freezene 100 sold by Witco. Alternately, the catalyst can be used as      pellets and each reactor operated as an ebullated bed, but operation in      the fluidized bed mode with powdered catalyst is preferred. </PAR><PAR>  The synthesis gas feed passes upward through the catalyst slurry and reacts      exothermally to yield methanol. The heat of reaction is absorbed by the      inert liquid and is removed by heat exchanger 118 to control the      temperature in the first stage reactor between about 455.degree. to      535.degree. F., preferably between about 475.degree. to 515.degree. F.      Cooling fluid stream 20 absorbs heat from the slurry by indirect heat      exchange in heat exchanger 118 and the hot fluid flows from the reactor as      stream 22. The cooling fluid can be cool synthesis gas feed, steam, boiler      feedwater, or another process stream. The temperature in reactor 116 is      controlled by a typical feedback control system which determines the      average temperature of the catalyst slurry, compares this temperature with      a selected set point, and utilizes the deviation from this set point to      drive a flow control valve (not shown) which regulates the flow rate of      either stream 20 or 22. Other control methods known in the art also can be      used to control reactor temperature. Effluent gas stream 24, now      containing methanol, unreacted synthesis gas components, a small amount of      vaporized inert liquid, and a small amount of entrained slurry, passes      into separator 119 where substantially all of the entrained slurry is      removed as stream 26, which flows into separator 120. The remaining      components in stream 28 flow through heat exchanger 112 and are cooled by      indirect heat exchange with synthesis gas feed stream 13 to condense a      fraction of the vaporized inert liquid originally in stream 28.      Optionally, heat can be removed from the unreacted synthesis gas by a heat      exchanger in the vapor space of the reactor (shown in FIG. 3). The cooled      stream 30 flows into separator 120 where condensed inert liquid and      previously entrained catalyst slurry are removed and returned via pump 122      to reactor 116 and separator 119. A portion of the slurry stream 32 is      returned to reactor 116 as stream 34 and the remainder as stream 36 passes      to separator 119 to aid in the separation of the entrained catalyst slurry      in stream 24. Other control methods known in the art also can be used to      control reactor temperature. </PAR><PAR>  Unreacted synthesis gas components and gaseous methanol flow as stream 38      into the second stage liquid phase methanol reactor 122 which contains a      slurry of a powdered methanol synthesis catalyst suspended in an inert      liquid similar to that described for reactor 116. The unreacted synthesis      gas components pass upward through the catalyst slurry and react      exothermally to yield additional methanol. The heat of reaction is      absorbed by the inert liquid and is removed by heat exchanger 124 to      control the temperature in the second stage reactor between about      415.degree. to 475.degree. F., preferably between about 425.degree. to      465.degree. F. Cooling fluid stream 40 absorbs heat from the slurry by      indirect heat exchange in heat exchanger 124 and the hot fluid flows from      the reactor as stream 42. The cooling fluid can be cool synthesis gas      feed, steam, boiler feedwater, or other process streams. Water is      optionally added to the reactor feed stream 38 through line 40. The      temperature in reactor 122 is controlled by a typical feedback control      system which determines the average temperature of the catalyst slurry,      compares this temperature with a selected set point, and utilizes the      deviation from this set point to drive a flow control valve (not shown)      which regulates the flow rate of either stream 40 or 42. </PAR><PAR>  Product stream 44, now containing methanol, unreacted synthesis gas      components, a small amount of vaporized inert liquid, and a small amount      of entrained slurry, passes into separator 126 where substantially all of      the entrained slurry is removed as stream 46, which flows into separator      128. The remaining components in stream 48 flow through heat exchanger 110      and are cooled by indirect heat exchange with at least a portion 11 of      synthesis gas feed stream 10 to condense at least a portion of the      vaporized inert liquid. The cooled stream 50 flows through heat exchanger      111 where it is further cooled by indirect heat exchange with stream 52 to      condense essentially all of the remaining vaporized inert liquid, and the      cooled stream 54 flows into separator 128 where condensed inert liquid and      previously entrained catalyst slurry are recovered. Additional inert      liquid makeup is introduced into separator 128 as needed via stream 56.      The recovered slurry including inert liquid makeup is removed from the      bottom of separator 128 and is returned to the reactor system as stream 58      by pump 130. The slurry in stream 58, typically containing about 0.5 to      2.0 weight % catalyst, is returned to one or more of the following      locations: to separator 126 as stream 60, to reactor 122 as stream 62, and      to separator 120 as stream 64. Crude product stream 68 is cooled and      partially condensed by indirect heat exchange with a portion of unreacted      synthesis gas stream 74 in heat exchanger 132 and also with cooling water      in heat exchanger 134. Alternately, under certain process conditions, it      may be advantageous to utilize stream 68 as feed to a third stage liquid      phase reactor system (not shown) for further conversion to methanol.      Cooled and partially condensed crude product stream 70 flows into      separator 136 and crude methanol stream 72 is withdrawn from the bottom of      the separator. Vapor stream 74 containing unreacted synthesis gas      components is withdrawn from the top of separator 136, and at least a      portion of stream 74 is heated in exchanger 132. The resulting heated      stream 52 is further heated in exchanger 111 to yield stream 77.      Optionally, separator 136 can include a short packed section 137,      recirculation loop 84, and pump 139 to minimize inert liquid droplet      carryover in vapor stream 74. </PAR><PAR>  Crude methanol stream 72, which is typically at a temperature between      80.degree. and 120.degree. F. and a pressure between 450 and 1450 psia,      contains dissolved unreacted synthesis components. In order to remove      these components, stream 72 is flashed across valve 144 to a pressure of      50 to 100 psia and flows into separator 146 which yields an intermediate      crude methanol liquid stream 76 and gas stream 75 suitable as fuel. Stream      76 is then flashed to near atmospheric pressure across valve 148 and flows      into storage tank 150 where a final gas stream 78 is recovered for fuel.      Crude methanol product is stored in tank 150 and is withdrawn when needed      as stream 80. Pump 152 delivers the final crude methanol product as stream      82. </PAR><PAR>  The process of the present invention can be integrated with a coal      gasification combined cycle (CGCC) power generation system in which      unreacted synthesis gas stream 77 is expanded in expander 140 and combined      with a portion 3 of the synthesis gas feed stream 1; the combined stream 5      is combusted in a gas turbine which drives an electric generator. Work      recovered in expander 140 is utilized with motor 142 to drive compressors      102 and 108. Purge streams 75 and 78 also can be used as fuel in the gas      turbine. The process of the present invention can be heat integrated with      the CGCC system by raising steam from the heats of reaction in reactors      116 and 122 and sending this steam to the CGCC steam turbine or      alternately to the CGCC gas turbine combustor. This steam is obtained by      introducing boiler feedwater through lines 20 and 40 into heat exchangers      118 and 124 respectively, and withdrawing steam therefrom as streams 22      and 42. At least a portion of crude methanol product stream 82 can be      utilized as a peak shaving fuel for the CGCC gas turbine during periods of      high power demand. </PAR><PAR>  Management of catalyst inventories and activities in reactors 116 and 122      can be accomplished in several ways. The first entails the individual      removal of spent catalyst from each reactor followed by the addition of      fresh catalyst to each reactor in sufficient amounts to control the      average catalyst activity at the desired level in each reactor. In this      operating mode, spent catalyst is removed directly from each of the      reactors via lines 85 and 86 respectively, and fresh catalyst is      introduced into each of the reactors via lines 88 and 90 respectively. The      catalyst is conveniently handled as a slurry with the selected inert      liquid. An alternate and preferred method of managing catalyst inventories      and activity levels is to remove spent catalyst through line 85 from the      first stage reactor 116, transfer partially spent catalyst from the second      stage reactor 122 via line 92 to reactor 116, and add fresh catalyst to      second reactor 122 via line 90. Catalyst addition, transfer, and      withdrawal can be accomplished either continuously or intermittently, and      the amount of catalyst replaced in each reactor per day is between about      0.2 and 1.5 wt% of the total catalyst in that reactor. The total catalyst      charge in a reactor varies between about 6,000 and 17,000 kg. The actual      rate of catalyst addition, transfer, and withdrawal will depend on reactor      operating conditions and the level of catalyst poisons in the synthesis      feed gas. </PAR><PAR>  The optimum temperature in a liquid phase methanol reactor is determined by      a balance between the kinetic reaction rate, catalyst deactivation rate,      and thermodynamic equilibrium. Higher temperatures yield higher kinetic      reaction rates while lower temperatures result in thermodynamic      equilibrium which favors higher methanol concentrations in the reactor      product. Catalyst life is also important in determining the optimum      temperature, since higher temperature causes a higher deactivation rate      due to sintering and promotes deactivation due to surface reactions with      impurities in the synthesis gas feed. Particular contaminants which      deactivate the catalyst include iron carbonyl compounds, sulfur compounds,      chlorides, and various metals. Reactor catalyst activity also influences      the choice of the optimum temperature, since lower activity catalyst      requires higher temperatures and higher activity catalyst requires lower      temperatures for an equivalent methanol productivity. The optimum reactor      temperature which yields the maximum conversion of synthesis gas to      methanol according to the present invention is thus a complex function of      several operating parameters, and cannot be predicted a priori from the      prior art. </PAR><PAR>  The staged liquid phase reactor system of the present invention as      described above allows higher synthesis gas conversion to methanol and      lower catalyst consumption compared with prior art processes. The      following Examples describe typical operating conditions for the staged      process of the present invention, compare the operation of the staged      process with a single-stage liquid phase methanol process, and illustrate      the benefits of temperature optimization in staged reactors. </PAR><PAC>  EXAMPLE 1 </PAC><PAR>  A process simulation was carried out for the single-stage liquid phase      methanol process shown schematically in FIG. 2. Synthesis gas feed 499,      typical of synthesis gas from the Texaco coal gasification process after      cooling and removal of sulfur compounds, has a composition of 36.5 mol%      hydrogen, 53.6 mol% carbon monoxide, 8.9 mol% carbon dioxide, 1.0 mol%      nitrogen, and less than 0.1 mol% methane and water. Feed stream 499,      initially at 74.degree. F. and 750 psia, is heated in heat exchangers 200      and 202 against hot effluent gas streams 505 and 506 from reactor 204.      Heated stream 502 contacts powdered methanol synthesis catalyst suspended      in an inert liquid in reactor 204. A kinetic model based on the results of      earlier laboratory autoclave and pilot plant experiments was used to      predict the extent of reaction and methanol production utilizing the      commercial methanol synthesis catalyst BASF S3-86 containing copper and      zinc oxide on alumina. In these experiments, the catalyst was a powder      having a particle size range of 1-10 microns suspended in Drakeol-10 (an      inert hydrocarbon oil containing 65 wt % paraffins and 35 wt % aromatics)      at a concentration of between about 20 and 50 wt %. The reactor product      stream 505, comprising methanol, hydrogen, carbon monoxide, carbon      dioxide, and a small amount of vaporized inert liquid, is cooled in      exchanger 202 to condense the inert liquid and then is flashed into      separator 210. The resulting cooled stream is separated in separator 210      into inert liquid stream 507, which is recycled to the reactor, and crude      gaseous product stream 506, which further cooled in exchanger 200 to      condense methanol product. Inert liquid makeup is added to separator 210      as needed. Cooled crude product stream 510 is flashed into separator 212,      the vapor stream 511 is cooled against cooling water in exchanger 214 and      is flashed into separator 216 to yield purge gas stream 514 and crude      methanol liquid stream 513. Crude liquid methanol stream 512 from      separator 212 and crude liquid methanol stream 513 are flashed into      separator 218 to yield purge stream 550 which is used as fuel and final      crude methanol stream 551. </PAR><PAR>  The catalyst activity in reactor 204 is controlled by removing spent      catalyst and adding fresh catalyst at sufficient rates such that the      average catalyst activity in the reactor is 50% of the fresh catalyst      activity (catalyst feed and withdrawal lines not shown). Catalyst activity      can also be defined as .eta., the ratio of average catalyst activity to      fresh catalyst activity; in this case .eta.andequals;0.5. A catalyst replacement      rate of 0.5%/day was selected, which means that 0.5 wt % of the total      catalyst inventory is replaced each day. The operating parameters include      a space velocity (SV) of 8,000 (std. liters)/(kg. catalyst-hr), a feed      rate of 23,000 lb moles/hr, and a reactor pressure of 750 psig. For these      operating conditions, feed composition, and average reactor catalyst      activity, the optimum reactor temperature to maximize methanol production      was found to be about 482.degree. F.; therefore the exothermic heat of      reaction is removed by cooling coil 206 in an amount sufficient to control      the reactor temperature at 482.degree. F. A heat and material balance for      this simulation is given in Table 1 and the reactor performance parameters      are summarized as Case 1 in Table 2, which represents the single-stage      reactor base case. </PAR><TBL>                                    TABLE 1                                      __________________________________________________________________________     HEAT AND MATERIAL

This system is identical to      the single-stage system of FIG. 2 except for the addition of second stage      reactor 208 with cooling coil 207, the addition of feed gas preheat      exchanger 205 located in the freeboard of reactor 204, and the catalyst      addition/withdrawal procedure. The synthesis gas feed composition,      pressure, and temperature are identical to those used in the single-stage      process. The first stage reactor pressure is 750 psig, and second stage      reactor pressure is 730 psig. Heat is removed by exchanger 205 and cooling      coil 206 in a sufficient amount to control the temperature in first stage      reactor 204 at 482.degree. F. as in Example 1. In addition, the feed rate      and space velocity in the first stage reactor are identical to those in      the single-stage reactor of FIG. 2. The space velocity in the second stage      reactor depends upon the degree of conversion in the first stage reactor      and varies between 7,000 and 7,400 std. liters/(kg. catalyst-hr) for the      various simulation cases studied. Fresh catalyst is added to the second      stage reactor and partially spent catalyst is withdrawn therefrom to      maintain an average reactor catalyst activity at 80% of the fresh catalyst      activity, or .eta.andequals;0.8. The partially spent catalyst from the second      reactor is transferred to the first stage reactor and spent catalyst is      withdrawn from the first stage reactor (catalyst addition and withdrawal      lines not shown). A catalyst replacement rate of 0.5%/day was selected,      which means that 0.5 wt % of the total catalyst inventory in each reactor      is replaced each day. The catalyst deactivation rate in the first stage      reactor, which is a function of reactor temperature and feed gas      composition as discussed earlier, is such that the average reactor      catalyst activity is 40% of the fresh catalyst activity, or .eta.andequals;0.4. For      the operating conditions, feed composition, and average reactor catalyst      activity in the second stage reactor 208, the optimum reactor temperature      to maximize methanol production was found to be about 452.degree. F. The      exothermic heat of reaction is removed by cooling coil 207 in an amount      sufficient to control the reactor temperature at 452.degree. F. A heat and      material balance for this simulation is given in Table 1 and the reactor      performance parameters are summarized as Case 2 in Table 2. This      represents the preferred mode of the present invention. </PAR><PAR>  Several additional simulations were carried out at other process conditions      for comparison with the base case (Case 1) and the preferred mode (Case      2). Process conditions for these additional simulations are summarized      below: </PAR><PA0>  Case 3 single-stage reactor operated with twice the catalyst inventory of      Case 1 </PA0><PA0>  Case 4 single-stage reactor operated at twice the catalyst replacement rate      of Case 3 </PA0><PA0>  Case 5 two-stage system similar to Case 2 but operated at 482.degree. F. in      the second stage </PA0><PA0>  Case 6 two-stage system operated at twice the catalyst replacement rate of      Case 5 </PA0><PA0>  Case 7 two-stage system operated at twice the catalyst replacement rate of      Case 2 </PA0><PAR>  The results of these simulations are summarized in Table 2 and lead to      several important conclusions regarding the preferred mode of the      invention (Case 2). First, a comparison of Case 2 with Case 1 demonstrates      the significant benefits of staged operation, namely, a 62% increase in      product conversion at half the catalyst consumption. Second, a comparison      of Case 2 with Case 5 illustrates the benefit of an optimum second stage      temperature, specifically an 18% improvement in product conversion for      Case 2 vs Case 5 at the same catalyst consumption. Third, a comparison of      Case 6 with Case 5 shows that doubling the catalyst consumption rate      results in a relatively small 7.6% increase in product conversion.      Finally, a comparison of Case 7 with Case 2 demonstrates that even with an      optimum second stage temperature, doubling the catalyst consumption rate      yields a small 5.8% increase in product conversion. </PAR><PAC>  EXAMPLE 2 </PAC><PAR>  Further simulations were carried out using the same catalyst, inert liquid,      catalyst slurry concentration, feed gas composition, pressure, and reactor      space velocities as in the preferred mode of Case 2 above. Methanol      productivity was predicted utilizing the kinetic model of Example 1 as a      function of temperature for typical relative catalyst activities in the      first and second stages, and the results are plotted in FIG. 4. The      relative catalyst activity, .eta., was set at 0.5 for the first stage      reactor and at 0.8 or 0.94 for the second stage reactor. FIG. 4      illustrates the key feature of the present invention, namely, that the      relationship between temperature and methanol productivity is distinctly      different for each reactor stage. As a result, the optimum temperature      range which maximizes methanol productivity is distinctly different for      each reactor stage. Each optimum temperature is a complex function of      relative catalyst activity, synthesis gas feed composition, interstage gas      composition, and temperature. For the specific conditions of these      simulations, the optimum temperature in the first stage is about      495.degree. F. and in the second stage is about 450.degree. F. Higher      catalyst activity reduces the optimum second stage temperature as shown by      comparing the second stage curve at .eta.andequals;0.94 with the curve at      .eta.andequals;0.8. </PAR><PAC>  EXAMPLE 3 </PAC><PAR>  Additional simulations were carried out to determine the effects of      pressure and feed gas composition on methanol production for single-stage      and two-stage reactor systems. The other operating parameters were the      same as Example 1. Three feed gas compositions were used--the CO rich gas      of Examples 1 and 2, a balanced gas from a steam-methane reformer having      stoichiometric concentrations of CO and hydrogen, and synthesis gas from a      Lurgi gasifier which has undergone shift and CO.sub.2 removal. The      compositions of these three feed gases are given in Table 3. </PAR><TBL>                TABLE 3                                                          ______________________________________                                         Feed Gas Compositions                                                          (Mole %)                                                                                        SMR      Shifted Lurgi                                                CO Rich  Balanced (CO.sub.2 Removed)                                   ______________________________________                                         Hydrogen  35         54       60                                               CO        51         23       21                                               CO.sub.2  13         2         1                                               N.sub.2    1         21        1                                               Methane    0          0       17                                               ______________________________________                                     </TBL><PAL>  The results of the additional simulations are given in Table 4.

It is also seen that two-stage      operation increases product recovery in all cases, and this occurs for two      reasons. First, there is less methanol loss in the unreacted synthesis gas      stream 514 for the two-stage system because the flow rate of stream 514 is      13% less than the corresponding stream 514 in the single-stage system.      Second, the methanol concentration in the final reactor effluent stream      505 is higher for the two-stage operation than the single-stage operation,      which allows higher product recovery. </PAR><PAR>  In an alternate mode of the invention as discussed earlier, the liquid      phase methanol process is integrated with a coal gasification combined      cycle (CGCC) power generation system. Raw synthesis gas containing      hydrogen, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and various impurities is      produced by a known coal gasification process such as the Texaco process.      Impurities including particulates and sulfur-containing compounds are      removed from the raw synthesis gas using any of the various known gas      purification processes to yield a purified synthesis gas feed. A portion      of the purified synthesis gas feed flows to the two-stage liquid phase      methanol process which is operated on a once-through basis as earlier      described. Unreacted synthesis gas and crude methanol are recovered from      the second stage reactor effluent gas; the unreacted synthesis gas and the      remaining portion of the purified synthesis gas feed are used as fuel for      a gas turbine-driven electric generator which is part of the CGCC power      generation system. The crude methanol is stored and used at least in part      as a peak shaving fuel for the gas turbine. Heat integration between the      two-stage methanol synthesis process and the CGCC system is accomplished      by utilizing the heat of the methanol synthesis reaction to generate steam      in each of the reactor stages; the steam is sent to the combustor of the      gas turbine-driven electric generator. Alternately, the steam can be sent      to one of the CGCC steam systems which provides utility steam to various      locations in the plant or to the steam turbine which drives another      electric generator. Since the exothermic heats of reaction for the      methanol synthesis reactions are higher than the heats of reaction for      competing reactions such as water gas shift, maximizing methanol      productivity also maximizes the amount of heat energy recovered as steam      from the two reactor cooling exchangers 118 and 124 in FIG. 1. In      addition, since the molar heat of combustion of methanol is about three      times that of hydrogen or CO, the amount of energy available through      combustion of the unreacted synthesis gas (streams 75, 78, and 81 in FIG.      1) and the combustion of the total crude methanol (stream 80) is maximized      when the reactors are operated at the optimum temperatures. </PAR><PAR>  Catalyst utilization is improved by staged operation in which fresh      catalyst is added to the second stage reactor, partially spent catalyst is      transferred from the second stage to the first stage reactor, and spent      catalyst is removed from the first reactor. The average catalyst activity      can be maintained at a high level in the second stage reactor because the      first stage reactor removes most of the catalyst poisons present in the      feed synthesis gas, and this higher catalyst activity allows the second      stage reactor to operate at a lower temperature which reduces the degree      of catalyst deactivation due to sintering. In addition, the operation of      the second stage reactor at a lower temperature reduces the loss of inert      oil in the methanol product thus reducing makeup oil cost and yielding a      higher purity methanol product. Another distinguishing feature of the      present invention over prior art staged methanol synthesis processes is      that the first stage reactor effluent flows directly into the second stage      reactor without the need for intermediate product recovery. This differs      from the staged reactor system of the earlier cited U.S. Pat. No.      4,766,154 in which methanol product is recovered from the first stage      effluent and the remaining unreacted synthesis gas is the feed to the      second stage reactor. </PAR><PAR>  Thus the present invention is a two-stage liquid phase process capable of      producing methanol from a wide range of synthesis gas compositions wherein      methanol productivity, methanol recovery, and catalyst utilization are      significantly higher than prior art processes. Optimum temperatures in      each stage are selected to maximize methanol productivity for a given feed      gas composition, type of catalyst, average catalyst activity, reactor      space velocity, and reactor pressure. Operation of the reactors at these      optimum temperatures also maximizes the total amount of available energy      produced by the two-stage reactor system (operating in a once-through      mode) for use elsewhere, preferably in the CGCC power generation system as      discussed earlier. </PAR><PAR>  The essential characteristics of the present invention are described fully      and completely in the foregoing disclosure, from which one skilled in the      art can understand the invention and make various changes and      modifications thereto without departing from the basic spirit and scope      thereof. </PAR></DETD><CLMS> <STM>  I claim: </STM><NUM>  1. </NUM><PAR>  1.
