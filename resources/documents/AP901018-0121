The vote killed an amendment by Sens. Albert Gore, D-Tenn., andBarbara Mikulski, D-Md., that would have scaled back increases ingasoline taxes and Medicare premiums and substituted aHouse-approved, three-pronged attack on those with higher incomes.   The amendment was one of more than two dozen ready for Senateconsideration, many of which have been designed to move the Senatebill closer to the soak-the-rich package that won House approvalTuesday.   ``Do we want to ask senior citizens in the hospital to pay moreso the wealthiest in our society can pay less?'' Gore asked beforethe vote on his amendment.   ``The middle class has no more to give,'' Ms. Mikulski said.   Democratic leaders praised the aim of the amendment but said itwould have killed the deficit-reduction package because PresidentBush has promised to veto any plan raising the top tax rate on thewealthiest Americans to 33 percent. The proposal would have raisedthat rate from 28 percent.   ``What we have tried to do is put together a package thepresident will sign,'' said Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, chairmanof the Finance Committee. ``There is substantial divergence withwhat came out of the House. ... We will end up with something thatis in between.''   The budget bill is on a fast track that congressional leadershope could place it on Bush's desk for his signature Friday night.   Without final action, or at least considerable progress on sucha package, Bush has said he'll shut down the government Saturdaymorning, when federal spending authority is due to expire.   A key element of the Senate's deficit plan is a 9{-cent increasein the gasoline tax. The Senate voted Wednesday to leave thatprovision intact. The Gore-Mikulski amendment would have provided a6-cent increase.   The amendment would have been attached to a measure raisingtaxes and reducing benefit programs by $250 billion over the nextfive years.   In addition to increasing the tax rate for the wealthiestAmericans, the Gore-Mikulski plan proposed imposing a 10 percentsurtax on those with taxable incomes over $1 million and raising to25 percent the alternative minimum tax designed to snare well-to-doinvestors who have so many deductions that they might otherwiseescape any tax.   The Senate package appeared to be in considerable troubleWednesday after Sen. Steven Symms, R-Idaho, proposed stripping the9{-cent increase in the gasoline tax. The issue wasn't settleduntil almost 14 hours later, just before midnight, when the Senateheeded pleas from Democratic and Republican leaders and used aprocedural vote to dispose of Symms' amendment.   ``Once again the American people are going to have their pocketspicked,'' Symms protested.   ``A vote for this amendment is a vote to destroy this effort atdeficit reduction,'' countered Majority Leader George J. Mitchell,D-Maine. ``No senator who votes for the Symms amendment should havethe temerity to go anywhere and say they are trying to reduce thedeficit.''   Symms' amendment, which was put aside on a 59-40 vote, probablywas the biggest challenge facing the bipartisan proposal.   In addition to raising the 9-cent gasoline tax and the 15-centtax on diesel by 9{ cents a gallon, the bill would boost taxes onalcoholic beverages, tobacco, and such luxuries as expensive cars,boats, furs and jewelry.   It would require retirees to pay slightly more for Medicarecoverage of doctors' bills; limit itemized deductions of peoplemaking more than $100,000 a year and raise to $89,000 the $51,300maximum wage against which the 1.45 percent Medicare tax isapplied.   A bigger package was shot down by the Senate on a 67-32 vote.   Sponsored by Sens. Kent Conrad, D-N.D., and Max Baucus, D-Mont.,it would have included those three tax increases on the wealthy,moderated the gas tax increase and Medicare charges, restored halfof $15 billion in farm-program cuts that would be required fordeficit reduction, and eliminated the proposed limitation onitemized deductions claimed by higher-income people.   Raising the gasoline tax in the name of deficit reduction is oneof the less popular ideas in Congress. The House would not accept apackage that included such an increase, and senators were toldWednesday that drivers would rebel.   The $250 billion in tax increases and tightening of Medicare andother benefits represents about half a promised $500 billiondeficit-reduction plan. The remainder, still working its waythrough Congress, would come from reductions in appropriations andin interest the government pays for borrowing.</TEXT></DOC>
