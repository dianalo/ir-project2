Few-nucleon systems are considered: theelectromagnetic structure of the deuteron and of the trinucleon system.The proton momentum distribution of He/sup 3/ is illustrated. Quasi-elasticelectron scattering is discussed. Research on hadron interactions inhadronic matter is seen as the key to advancing in this field.</TEXT></DOC>
