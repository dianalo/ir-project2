<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-32-0461 </DOCNO><TEXT>Continual ''extensions'' of two-dimensional Toda lattices are proposed.They are described by integro-differential equations, generally speaking,with singular kernels, depending on new (third) variable. The problemof their integrability on the corresponding class of the initial discretesystem solutions is discussed. The latter takes place, in particular,for the kernel coinciding with the causal function. 5 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
