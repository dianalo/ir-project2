The multi-stage reform process will be protracted,although certain constitutional reforms should come asquickly as possible.

But the pessimism openlyexpressed in the Western press also creates a distortedpicture of events -- just as the excessive optimism thateverywhere accompanied Mr. Gorbachev once did.   The price of Mr. Gorbachev's legacy is well known, andtherefore, at the very least, it is unreasonable to demand ofBoris Yeltsin and the other CIS presidents an immediatemiracle.   It does no harm to review what happened in the formerU.S.S.R. last year. Rumors about an imminent military coupcaused panic both within the U.S.S.R. and abroad, andalthough in the end nothing happened, the alarm was hardlyfalse. Consider the facts of last summer: The centralgovernment was trying to inflame the territorial disputebetween Russia and the Ukraine; Mr. Gorbachev convened ameeting of generals; Russian Vice President Alexander Rutskoiwas fiercely attacking President Yeltsin's government withappeals to military-industrial institutions; so-called&quot;pro-state democrats&quot; were preparing demonstrations insupport of maintaining the Soviet Union.   It is also not hard to imagine what the reaction of theWest would have been to the creation of a new &quot;StateEmergency Committee&quot; with a human face. The Gorbachev-Rutskoiaxis, supported by the authority of other &quot;democrats,&quot; wouldhave satisfied the West's need for &quot;stability.&quot; It was Mr.Yeltsin's decisive action -- concluding the agreement aboutthe CIS on Dec. 8, 1991, and finally finishing off thescheming imperial center -- that saved us from impendingcatastrophe.   But Mr. Yeltsin is finding it much harder to carry outeconomic reforms. An understanding of this requires a preciseanalysis of the balance of power.   The tanks that appeared in the early morning of Aug. 19 onthe streets of Moscow provoked almost unanimous hostilityfrom all of society -- the people did not want to return toslavery, while the state machinery basically regarded thepath to capitalism as the surest means of becoming rich. (Therapid downfall of Mr. Gorbachev has the same underlying cause-- having outmaneuvered himself, the architect of perestroikaturned out to be not required by anyone -- within his owncountry, of course -- and was forced to leave the politicalstage.) But as soon as the implementation of global economicprograms begins, unanimity disappears and the balance offorces changes sharply.   Whereas productive forces in society and rapidly growingprivate business need the constitutional securing of theright of private ownership, state organs are aiming toprolong the period of economic confusion. What the officialswant is perfectly obvious -- to exploit their currentposition for a smooth transition to newly formed privatestructures or simply to guarantee their future. The numerouscriticisms of the team of the Russian vice premier, YegorGaidar, rightly indicate the need for a rapid beginning ofthe privatization program. But for some reason thesecriticisms ignore obstacles this government faces, forexample the powerful opposition by the state apparatus toconstitutional amendments by the Russian Parliament.   The so-called patriotic forces in Russia hope to exploitthis split. This red-brown coalition (left-leaners and heirsto fascists) nevertheless intends to keep ideology to aminimum. Most probably we will be dealing with an ultra-rightnationalistic party, like that of Jean-Marie Le Pen inFrance.   Today, Mr. Yeltsin faces an exceptionally complexsituation. In making decisions he must take into account thegrowing irritation of the population; the dissatisfaction ofthe private sector; the pressure of the state apparatus; thesinister shadow of the red-browns.   The West can have a serious influence on what happens. Itmust develop a program of cooperation with the Russiangovernment that would allow Mr. Yeltsin to create a long-termbase of support for his reform program. For example, thestart of Russian-American military cooperation, or theinvestment of high-technology Western firms in demilitarizedenterprises, would force the military-industrial institutionsto form a coalition with the Russian government. But the maintrump card in the government's struggle with anti-reformersmay be the foreign-debt problem.   The mention of this problem may in itself raise in many askeptical smile. Parallels with Latin America are quiteinappropriate here: The debt of Russia and the other stateshas not yet reached the point where even repaying theinterest becomes an intolerable financial burden. Indeed,even to give an exact evaluation of the debt liabilities ofthe former Soviet Union is extremely difficult. Theinformation given by different authoritative sources variesin the fantastic range of $55 billion to $80 billion.   Whatever the overall sum of foreign debt, one thing isclear. Debt relief and to some extent debt forgiveness arethe most effective way for the West to influence developmentof events in the CIS. It is highly unlikely that debt reliefor even debt forgiveness for Russia, as the principalsuccessor of the Soviet Union's financial obligations, wouldbe a serious blow to the world credit system.   Recall that President Bush's decision to write off Egypt's$7 billion debt at the time of the Gulf War was acceptedcalmly. The agreement of Hosni Mubarak to participate in theanti-Iraq coalition was deemed a sufficient politicalargument. By this logic, it would be interesting to see whatweight would be given to the neutralization of 30,000 nuclearwarheads. But the main argument in favor of debt relief isthat it would pave the way to the New World Order -- an orderin which, in contrast to the past's &quot;Realpolitik,&quot; morals andpolitics cease to be incompatible.   Let us imagine for an instant that the Castro regime inCuba should fall -- an event likely to occur this year.Without doubt, the new Cuban government would refuse to payFidel Castro's debts to Moscow. It would be impossible todispute the logic of this decision -- after all, the moneypoured into the communist regime in Cuba by the Kremlin hasin the end brought endless repression and poverty to theCuban people. Now let us remember the last two years of Mr.Gorbachev's rule, when the Soviet foreign debt made a trulycosmic leap. These were years when the republics grew inpower.   To make communism stronger, using Western credit -- thiswas Mr. Gorbachev's ultimate goal. What we encountered inthis case was not the dismal tradition of Realpolitik, bywhich the West offered credit to totalitarian regimes, but aconscious preference of the imperial communist center torapidly strengthening democratic forces. The West was readyto give billions to save Mr. Gorbachev from the &quot;terribleconservatives.&quot; All attempts by prominent officials of thedemocratic movement to appeal for common sense (here weshould mention Andrei Sakharov) encountered a dense wall ofincomprehension, and even hostility.   The outcome is well known: Communism in Russia has beenoverthrown, and the victors have inherited not only a brokeneconomy and interethnic enmity, but also an enormous foreigndebt. It is a debt with which none of the new leaders has anyconnection; a debt that was used for it is not known whatpurposes, but most probably for the struggle againstthemselves. And it is a debt that now has to be paid at theexpense of the good of the economy.   Among Mr. Gorbachev's creditors, a special place isoccupied by Germany. Germany granted the former Soviet Unionthe greater part of its Western credit, whether it was $30billion or $40 billion. But in contrast to its Westernpartners, who essentially paid for their own fear and lack ofvision, Germany lent money for a concrete purpose: Germanunification.   The dream of the German people, which had seemedunrealizable, became a reality in literally a few months, andone can understand the determination of Chancellor HelmutKohl not to spare means for achieving the sacred goal. In theeyes of Mr. Kohl, the removal of Soviet troops from theterritory of East Germany was a big enough prize to allow himto close his eyes to the use of the Soviet army againstpeaceful demonstrators. And the price paid for this &quot;verynice piece of real estate&quot; was much lower than its realworth.   Why then today, after being ravaged by communists, shouldRussia essentially pay for the reunification of Germany?   Western diplomats are now facing certain difficulties inestablishing working relations with the states of the CIS.This is not surprising, since radical changes on thegeopolitical map demand new conceptions and, mostimportantly, an unequivocal rejection of stereotypes. It willbe remembered how tense and uncomfortable President Bush wasover the weekend with President Yeltsin. After all, evenmentioning Mr. Yeltsin's name in the corridors of the WhiteHouse was until recently considered bad form. Mr. Bush'spragmatism nevertheless played a positive role.   Let us hope that this approach reflects the readiness ofthe West to offer Russia a new and balanced cooperationprogram. Cooperation, which in the New World Order shouldgradually become union, is necessary so that together we canmeet the challenges ahead with confidence.   ---   Mr. Kasparov, the world chess champion and head of theMoscow region branch of the Democratic Party of Russia, is acontributing editor of the Journal.   ---   Correction                                                                                                          Due to an editing error, Garry Kasparov's Feb. 4 articlegave the wrong date in referring to the possibility of asecond coup attempt in the former Soviet Union.
