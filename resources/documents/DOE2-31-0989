Introductionof gallium addition inert to carbon below 15% (at.) into the alloy Ni-Mnresults in the improvement of wettability and increase of the rate ofmelts' spreading along graphite. This is evidently connected with interactionpeculiarities of melt's components, which favour the increasing of thermodynamicactivity of the adhesive-active component-manganese.</TEXT></DOC>
