Prices also dropped in London and Frankfurt.    Traders said Tokyo investors continued to vacillate between wanting to buy on the encouraging signs in the foreign exchange and bond markets -- as well as the stock market itself -- and wanting to stay safely on the sidelines because of Emperor Hirohito's failing health.    &quot;General market sentiment is pretty good,&quot; said one trader. &quot;Many people are saying, 'This is a good buying opportunity, so get in there.'&quot;    But uncertainty over the emperor's health, and over what effect it might have on the market when the emperor dies, continues to keep the majority of investors on the sidelines, he said.    The Nikkei index closed at 27545.53, down 154.60 points. The Tokyo stock price index of all issues listed in the first section fell 9.84 points to close at 2125.78. Volume on the first section was estimated at 650 million shares, down from one billion shares last Friday, the last full day of trading.    In early trading in Tokyo Tuesday, the Nikkei index fell 101.25 points to 27444.28.    Only five sectors, including banks, railways and shipbuilders, were higher Monday, while most of the rest of the market was unchanged to weaker, traders said.    Steel stocks were mostly lower. NKK fell 18 yen to 782 yen ($5.85).    Among auto makers listed on the Tokyo first section, nearly all were lower except Suzuki Motors, which edged up 7 to 705. Toyota fell 40 to 2,560, while Honda was 30 lower at 2,120.    Blue-chip electricals were also left to drift lower in slow trading. Hitachi fell 50 to 1,610, while Fujitsu was down 40 to 1,660.    Traders said that some kind of setback is likely when the emperor dies. Estimates ranged from losses of 100 points to 400 points for the Nikkei index on the day following his death, but all agreed the effect would be temporary.    London share prices sagged, closing at the day's lowest point, as a negative start to Wall Street and concerns over slumping oil prices weighed on a thin market.    Dealers said declines in prices and volume reflected renewed skittish sentiment in contrast to last week's enthusiasm over a better than expected U.K. trade report for August and brisk levels of corporate activity and takeover speculation.    &quot;Cold water has been poured on the market and any advance has been stopped dead in its tracks,&quot; one dealer said.    The Financial Times 100-share index ended 23.9 points lower at 1802.6, perilously close to the 1800 barrier. The 30-share index fell 20.7 to 1455.8. Volume was modest, as just 336.6 million shares changed hands, compared with 550.1 million Friday.    The Dow Jones Industrial Average was off 25.43 points as London trading subsided. Several dealers said Wall Street's slide came on the heels of talk in New York that a major U.S. brokerage issued a strongly worded recommendation for clients to switch out of equities.    And the declining crude oil price took its toll on market sentiment, some said. &quot;It might have absolutely horrendous implications for the U.K. balance of payments&quot; outlook, one market-maker said.    Among major losers, Enterprise Oil closed off 43 pence to 639 ($10.80) after last week's surge on rumors that London andamp; Scottish Marine Oil had received bids for as much as 800 pence a share for its approximately 25% stake in Enterprise. Lasmo announced last month its intent to sell its Enterprise stake.    Enterprise shares slid as players had second thoughts about the lofty valuations assigned to the shares in last week's trading, analysts said. Lasmo shares dropped in sympathy, losing 29 to 559. Meanwhile, RTZ Corp., which holds nearly 30% of Lasmo, eased 13 at 439.    Among major oil stocks, Shell Transport andamp; Trading lost 9 to 959, and British Petroleum fell 6 to 237.    Share prices on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange closed broadly lower in thin dealings. The DAX index dropped 10.24 points to close at 1242.44.    Following several weeks of steep gains, investors are increasingly willing to take profits and wait for a technical downward correction before returning to the market with purchasing orders, brokers said.    News of the death of Bavarian Prime Minister Franz Josef Strauss, one of the most influential political leaders in postwar Germany, also depressed the market, some brokers said. Mr. Strauss is widely credited with turning Bavaria, and particularly the area around Munich, into one of the most prosperous regions in West Germany, and he had a strong voice in economic policy-making by the Bonn government.    Auto maker Daimler-Benz and its majority-owned subsidiary AEG posted the largest declines. Daimler tumbled 14 marks to 692 ($370), falling below the 700-mark line. AEG plunged 10.7, or 5.5%, to 186.7 after Daimler terminated its 200-mark tender offer for the shares it didn't yet own last Friday. Since starting its bid July 1, Daimler has boosted its stake in AEG to 80% from 68%.    Among other auto makers, Bayerische Motoren Werke fell 6.8 to 504.2, and Volkswagen slid 3 to 269.5.    Siemens, West Germany's largest electronics group, declined 2.7 to 470 after announcing a major management reshuffle, under which tasks will be shifted from the central office to the operating divisions.    Meanwhile, shares closed lower in Paris and Amsterdam, mixed in Zurich and higher in Brussels, Stockholm and Milan.    Prices closed lower in Taipei, Hong Kong and Singapore and were mixed in Wellington and Manila. Seoul and Sydney were closed for holidays.    Here are price trends on the world's major stock markets, as calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital International Perspective, Geneva. To make them directly comparable, each index is based on the close of 1969 equaling 100.
