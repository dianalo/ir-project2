Now, dogged as a marathon runner, earnest as a civics teacher, Dick Gephardt is heading into a crucial test of his presidential campaign. How will his made-in-the-North campaign theme -- a populist, South Korea-bashing attack on callous corporations and cheating trading partners -- play in the South on Super Tuesday?    Some independent observers think it could play quite well, and without much modification at all.    &quot;That's what his opponents haven't quite realized,&quot; says Claibourne Darden, an Atlanta-based pollster with a down-home accent and an inborn Southern talent for turning a phrase. &quot;Up North, his message translates into jobs and wages. But down South, it translates into patriotism: 'Don't push us around.' Same message -- just flying in different-colored airplanes.&quot;    University of Florida political scientist Kenneth Wald senses a Southern asset in Congressman Gephardt's &quot;studied ambiguity.&quot; This &quot;enables people to project onto him anything they want to project,&quot; Prof. Wald explains. &quot;In that respect, and that respect only, he resembles Jimmy Carter in 1976.&quot;    Top Gephardt campaign aides say the Missouri Democrat's central themes won't change. &quot;Dick's message is about getting control of your own destiny,&quot; says national campaign manager Bill Carrick, a native South Carolinian. &quot;In the South, that's a mind-set that goes back to the Civil War.&quot;    Deputy campaign manager Joe Trippi notes that critics have been pounding Mr. Gephardt as a trade &quot;protectionist.&quot; Then he proposes a counterpunch that just might score. &quot;I wish Dick would say, 'I'm not a protectionist. I'm an American.'&quot;    Opponents failed to deck Rep. Gephardt in either New Hampshire or Iowa, even though he got a largely negative press. Exit polls in both states found he scored among blue-collar, elderly and conservative Democrats -- three types abundant here in the South. But the slugging will be the roughest yet leading up to Super Tuesday on March 8, when 20 states, including 14 Southern and border states, vote.    &quot;The question is, who's the most consistent friend of working people,&quot; argues Larry Harrington, deputy campaign manager for Tennessee's Sen. Albert Gore. &quot;It's not Dick Gephardt, who voted for the corporate giveaways of the 1981 tax cut and against raising the minimum wage.&quot; (Mr. Gore, as a House member, voted against the Reagan cut; in 1977, Rep. Gephardt voted against a minimum-wage increase embedded in a complicated bill that also weakened some child-labor restrictions.)    Critics will find ample contradictions in the Gephardt record. The same man who now attacks &quot;vested interests&quot; courted oil-state representatives when Democrats scrambled to fashion an alternative to the 1981 bill. Some colleagues jokingly called him &quot;J.R.&quot; -- for J.R. Ewing of &quot;Dallas.&quot;    Reflecting ever-widening ambitions, Congressman Gephardt moved in stages. He began as a moderately conservative Democrat, opposing creation of the Consumer Protection Agency and championing a Human Life constitutional amendment; became a Neo-Liberal or &quot;Atari Democrat,&quot; searching for bold &quot;new ideas&quot; to spur economic growth; moved on to moderate-to-liberal Democrat, jettisoning the Human Life amendment. Now he's a Populist Democrat, scourge of The Establishment.    The question is how much any of this will matter to the voters. Prof. Wald, the political scientist, thinks Mr. Gephardt may be blessed with a likable personality that &quot;transcends issue positions.&quot;    That personality is clearly one of this candidate's greatest assets. Nothing ever seems to rattle Mr. Gephardt -- not even the out-of-the-blue question, from an elderly lady in an Iowa nursing home, who asked him whether women are seducing men to get pregnant. (He sidestepped that one with a laugh.) He is steady, reassuring -- and always prepared to seize the opportunities that come his way.    Indiana Rep. Andrew Jacobs, a Democrat who's neutral in the presidential-nomination contest, says Mr. Gephardt reminds him of a time in his life when he had to eat a lot of dinners at a drive-in restaurant. &quot;The seagulls would fight over any morsel that fell to the ground,&quot; recalls Mr. Jacobs. &quot;But there was a little sparrow that always sat up there on the canopy. He'd cock his little head, and look and look. And at the right moment, he'd shoot down and grab it.&quot;    Eventually, some political observers think, Mr. Gephardt will have to go beyond his current populist themes. &quot;I don't see anything in his quiver that appeals to suburban, white-collar Democrats,&quot; says Eddie Mahe, a Republican political consultant in Washington. &quot;He'll have to broaden his message,&quot; agrees Kirk O'Donnell, president of Washington's Center for National Policy, a Democratic think-tank. &quot;But focusing on the economy is the right place for a Democrat to be.&quot;    If the message needs to be broadened, it will be broadened. Everything in Mr. Gephardt's past history tells you that. Meanwhile, his strategists think they've got a pretty durable message right now. They point to polls, all taken shortly before the New Hampshire primary, that showed their man doing very well in the South. In Texas, for example, a Dallas Morning News poll showed Mr. Gephardt out front with 27%, followed by Jesse Jackson with 15% and Michael Dukakis with 14%.    &quot;A lot of people perceive this to be a regional (Northern) message,&quot; says pollster Ed Reilly. &quot;It's not. This message has legs. It will work all over.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
