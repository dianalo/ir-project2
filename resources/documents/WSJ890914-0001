Adding to the slide was confusion among traders as to the U.S. government's plans for total wheat acreage to be planted beginning this fall, analysts added.    Last night, however, the Agriculture Department said the acreage of harvested wheat will be allowed to increase to 69.6 million acres from an estimated 67.5 million acres. Wheat planting estimates had ranged as high as 90 million acres for next year.    Once wheat futures prices started to fall, &quot;they dragged down corn and soybean prices with them,&quot; said Katharina Zimmer, a futures analyst with Merrill Lynch andamp; Co. in New York.    Oleg Klimov, head of Exportkhleb, the grain buying agent for the Soviet Union, was quoted by Reuters news service early yesterday as having told a weekly newspaper in the Soviet Union that his country had essentially completed purchases of grain from foreign countries this year.    &quot;But he didn't say whether he was referring to fiscal year ending Sept. 30 or to the calendar year,&quot; complained Conrad Leslie, head of Leslie Analytical Organization Inc., Chicago, expressing the frustration felt by many analysts trying to gauge the market impact of Mr. Klimov's remarks.    The report went on to quote Mr. Klimov as saying that the U.S.S.R.'s grain imports next year were likely to be less than this year's as a result of a previously announced plan to pay Soviet farmers in foreign currency for a portion of their crop.    Wheat futures for delivery in July of next year fell 12.75 cents a bushel to close at $3.47 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade.    The selling in the wheat futures pit at the Board of Trade quickly spilled over into the corn and soybean pits, overwhelming the meager strength in these contracts that existed early yesterday, analysts said. Selling by speculators and local pit traders gambling that at least a temporary rout was in the making became a self-fulfilling prophecy. Their selling depressed prices and triggered further sell orders from managed funds and others who had entered orders earlier to sell at predetermined prices.    Corn futures for December delivery closed down 5.5 cents at $2.295 a bushel and soybean futures for November delivery dropped 10.5 cents a bushel to close at $5.75 a bushel.    In other commodity markets yesterday:    ENERGY: Petroleum futures rallied on rumors and technical factors with several gasoline and crude contracts reaching life-of-contract highs. Gasoline set the pace, although heating oil also was firm in trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Unleaded gasoline for October delivery rose 0.86 cent a gallon to settle at 57.75 cents a gallon. &quot;We're seeing a lot of strength on the product side,&quot; said one energy futures trader. This helped push up crude oil futures, with the first six contract months all reaching life-of-contract highs. West Texas Intermediate crude for October delivery briefly broke through the technically important level of $20 a barrel before easing back. It settled at $19.86 a barrel, up 16 cents for the day. Rumors of more refinery fires, which turned out to be false, contributed to the rise in futures prices, but analysts cited an underlying bullish tone to the market. The American Petroleum Institute's report on U.S. oil statistics, which was released late Tuesday after trading had closed and showed an increase in inventories in the latest week, failed to have the moderately bearish impact on prices that had been expected.    PRECIOUS METALS: Futures prices were narrowly mixed despite a stronger dollar for most of the day. December delivery gold advanced 20 cents an ounce to $365.00. December silver was off 0.5 cent an ounce at $5.1720. October platinum declined 30 cents an ounce to $474.90. One analyst said the performance by precious metals was poor in light of the weakness of the dollar and strength of crude oil, which is considered an inflation gauge. Traders appear to be concerned that any advances in gold prices will be met by producers selling, which is inhibiting demand, particularly in the cash bullion market, he said. The view has merit, he said, because the Soviet Union and South Africa, both major producers, are desperate for foreign exchange and selling gold is a good way to obtain it. Another analyst, Sharon Ziemian, vice president of Citibank in New York, observed that, if there is any hanging back by buyers, it is because they can't clearly see which way the economy is going at the moment. Several reports, such as the one on the merchandise trade deficit, are to be released this week, and they will give traders a better idea if the economy will continue to sustain the high dollar, she said. &quot;A strong economic picture would indicate potential inflationary pressure, which should create support for precious metals,&quot; Ms. Ziemian said. COTTON: Futures prices rose sharply on the prospect of tighter world supplies and adverse growing weather in Texas. The October delivery advanced its daily permissible limit of two cents a pound to 73.77 cents. Other contracts were 1.13 cents to 1.76 cents higher, with those that will expire soonest advancing the most. An Agriculture Department report, released after the close of trading Tuesday, raised expected output from the U.S. 1989-90 crop by almost 500,000 bales -- to 12.3 million bales -- from last month's estimate. However, this increase was offset by an expected reduction in stocks on Aug. 1, the beginning of the current crop year, by about 400,000 bales from the previous report. World-wide stocks on July 31, 1990, are expected to decline about one million bales from the July estimate to 25.2 million bales. U.S. stocks on July 31, 1990, are projected to remain about unchanged at 3.9 million bales, the report said. The expectation of higher U.S. production was based on good growing weather, one analyst noted. Since then, weather in parts of Texas, a major growing area, has been rainy and cold, which has delayed the development of the crop. There has even been damage from hail in one small area, he said. If the delays continue, the cotton could be susceptible to frost damage, he said. </TEXT></DOC>
