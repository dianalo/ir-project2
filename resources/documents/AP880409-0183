On the New York Mercantile Exchange, contracts for May deliveryof West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark U.S. crude oil, settledFriday at $16.88 per 42-gallon barrel, down 18 cents fromThursday's close. Most other contract months lost 20 cents.   Among refined products traded on the exchange, wholesale heatingoil for May delivery fell 0.27 cent a gallon to 45.46 cents, whilewholesale unleaded gasoline for May edged down 0.05 cent a gallonto 48.77 cents.   Analysts said oil traders don't expect the weekend meeting ofOPEC's pricing committee in Vienna, Austria, to produce a plan tocombat a world price slump.   That feeling was reinforced by a statement Friday by Indonesia'soil minister, who said on his arrival in Vienna that the meetingwas unlikely to produce any changes in the current oil policy ofthe 13-nation Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.   ``We need something very significant to take us through these(price) levels,'' said Chris McCormack, an oil futures broker forinvestment firm Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. ``This meeting is notof any consequence.''   In addition to the Indonesian oil minister, the five-member OPECpricing panel is made up of ministers representing Saudi Arabia,Nigeria, Venezuela and Algeria. They are expected to assess oilmarket conditions and recommend action for the next full meeting ofthe cartel, which is set for June 8.   Last December, OPEC agreed to retain existing oil productionquotas for the individual member countries in hope of holding crudeprices at $18 a barrel.</TEXT></DOC>
