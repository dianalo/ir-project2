The accord, signed by all 13 members of the Organization ofPetroleum Exporting Countries in the sixth day of sometimes-tensebargaining, lifts OPEC's official production ceiling to 19.5 millionbarrels a day in the July-December period from the 18.5 millionbarrels in effect for January-June.   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the July contract for WestTexas Intermediate _ the benchmark U.S. crude _ closed down 79 centsat $19.67 a barrel.   OPEC is limiting production in an attempt to support a price of$18 a 42-gallon barrel in the last half of the year.   Analysts say OPEC has been pumping an estimated 21 millionbarrels a day in recent weeks, so the producing nations would haveto curb output to meet the new supply level.   ``Everybody is supposed to rein in production levels,'' said OPECPresident Rilwanu Lukman.   If they do, analysts say, crude prices and gasoline prices at thepump should hold steady.   At their final strategy session, the ministers agreed that aspecial committee would meet in September to review the oil market.   ``If it is found that the demand warrants an increase in theceiling, then this can be raised to 20 million barrels per day orany other level agreed upon,'' read a statement released by theministers. Any adjustments would take effect Oct. 1.   Under the accord, the 1 million barrel increase in the productionceiling will be distributed proportionately among all members.   Talks had stalled Tuesday over Kuwait's demand for a greatershare of any increase in the ceiling, and some Kuwaiti delegatesindicated that nation did not accept its new quota.   Lukman, asked about Kuwait's position, told a news conference,``Kuwait signed the resolution.''   But Kuwaiti Oil Minister Ali Khalifa al-Sabah later toldreporters he had made a reservation to the agreement. He said hewould give details on Thursday.   A Kuwaiti delegate, who demanded anonymity, said his governmentdoesn't feel bound by the quota assigned it under the new accord.Another Kuwaiti delegate, who also sought anonymity, said Sabahwrote those reservations in the margin of the agreement signed bythe ministers.   Kuwait has been pumping well over its OPEC quota. If it continuesdoing so, it would add to the world supply and possibly help weakenprices.   The United Arab Emirates also has persistently produced more thanits ceiling. There was no indication whether it intended to adhereto its new target, although a Kuwaiti delegate said the U.A.E.verbally expressed its reservations in the closed meeting.   Prices have risen from near-term lows reached in late 1988,partly due to OPEC cutbacks earlier in the year and to accidentsthat temporarily disrupted supplies in key oil-producing regions ofthe world.   The average price of a basket of seven crudes monitored by OPECexceeded the $18 a barrel reference earlier in the year and pricesare up more than 40 percent since last November.   In its insistence on a greater share of the increase, Kuwait waspitted against influential Saudi Arabia, the world's largest crudeexporters.   Saudi Arabia's Hisham Nazer walked out of the OPEC meetinghand-in-hand with Sabah in an apparent attempt to signal theirdifferences were patched up.   Nazer said several times during the bargaining that he wanted tosee prices rising.   Kuwait, however, is concerned that higher prices will erode thecartel's share of the oil market to non-OPEC countries, analystssay. Higher prices encourage more production and more exploration byproducers.   The ministers' statement said they intend to talk to independentproducing nations ``with a view to soliciting their cooperation insupport of market stability.''   Some of those countries agreed earlier in the year to curtailtheir output some to help bolster prices.   Under the agreement, Saudi Arabia's new quota will be 4.8 millionbarrels a day, up from 4.5 million barrels.   Iran and Iraq will have quotas of 2.8 million barrels a day, upfrom 2.6 million barrels in the January-June period.   Other quotas for the July-December period are: Algeria, 733,000barrels per day; Ecuador, 242,000 barrels; Gabon, 175,000, andIndonesia, 1.3 million barrels.   Others included Kuwait, 1.1 million barrels; Libya, 1.1 millionbarrels; Nigeria, 1.4 million barrels; Qatar, 329,000 barrels;United Arab Emirates, 1 million barrels, and Venezuela, 1.7 millionbarrels.</TEXT></DOC>
