All patients underwentselective coronary arteriography and left ventriculography, and 93 hadmyocardial infarction (MI), 30 had effort angina (EA) and 15 were normal(control). Sensitivities for detecting IHD (SPECT: planar = 96 %: 89%, p andless; 0.01), individual coronary arterial lesions (left anterior descendingartery = LAD, 84 %: 68 %, p andless; 0.005; left circumflex artery = LCX, 60%: 47 % NS; right coronary artery = RCA, 88 %: 69 %, p andless; 0.01), multivesseldisease (= LAD + LCX and/or RCA, 53 %: 31 %, p andless; 0.025), and three vesseldisease (60 %: 13 %, p andless; 0.005) were significantly higher by SPECT thanby planar imaging. In addition, detection of ventricular aneurysms bySPECT was possible with a reasonably high sensitivity (94 %) and specificity(84 %). Signs of aneurysm included 1) an extensive anterior permanentdefect, 2) a large left ventricular cavity, and 3) widening of the anglecomposed by the septal and lateral walls toward the apex in transaxialimages. Sensitivity for detecting IHD was significantly lower in patientswithout MI (i.e., EA) than in patients with MI (MI: EA = 100 %: 83 %,p andless; 0.005). Sensitivity for detecting individual coronary arterial lesionswas lower in the absence than in the presence of MI (LAD; 77 %: 87 %,LCX; 38 %: 68 %, RCA; 71 %: 90 %, respectively), with multivessel diseasethan with single vessel disease, and with mild than with severe gradeof stenosis. Sensitivity for detecting multivessel disease was lowerin patients without MI than in those with MI (31 %: 61 %, respectively),and in anterior MI than in posteroinferior MI, or both MIs (36 %: 69%: 100%, respectively).
