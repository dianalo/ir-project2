<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-11-0578 </DOCNO><TEXT>The outboard breeding shield design for TIBER-II is described. The designallows for tritium self-sufficiency without compromising magnet protection,design simplicity, and the testing mission of the device. The shieldconsists of a beryllium pebble front zone backed by a steel pebble zone.The shield is cooled by an aqueous solution containing 16 g LiNO/sub3/ per 100 cm/sup 3/. A double first wall is used to insure uniform coolingand minimize pressure. The design pressure for the outboard shield is0.19 MPa and the coolant temperature is less than 75{sup 0}C.</TEXT></DOC>
