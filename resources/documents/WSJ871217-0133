After Trump the Tower, Trump the Parc and Trump the Castle, the Book was probably inevitable. Besides, to quote you, &quot;Modesty isn't my favorite word.&quot; And why should it be, Mr. Trump? You and co-author Tony Schwartz have written a big book, no question about it. Not in pages, mind you. It's big in the ways that really matter. That six-figure advance -- that's big. As a writer, you're a helluva deal maker. And you say it's for charity. Great.    But here's what I'm worried about, sir. Everybody knows by now what a fraud these CEO autobiographies have turned out to be. Once Iacocca-mania took hold, every corporate hotshot in America got a zillion dollars to write his memoirs. And what did they do? They wrote self-serving, unreadable pap. But you're not like them, right, Mr. Trump? You wouldn't take a big advance bucks and then leave out all the good stuff, would you? That just wouldn't do much for your reputation, and as you say yourself -- right there in that chapter where you're explaining why you didn't &quot;import truckloads of junkies, prostitutes and thieves&quot; to get rid of the tenants in Trump Parc, your building on Central Park South -- &quot;I have a reputation to uphold.&quot; You certainly do. So let's get right to the good stuff.    Your fight with Holiday Inns in Atlantic City -- the one in which you &quot;made their lives so miserable they finally gave up and sold out their share&quot; to you. That must have been a doozy. How about some great inside stories about that fight?    &quot;Under the agreement I finally made to buy out Holiday's share, I may be precluded from saying anything in detail about those conflicts.&quot;    Gee, too bad. I wonder if your publisher, Random House, knew that before it gave you the book contract. I guess it figured you had plenty of other inside skinny, right? Since your book is titled, &quot;Trump: The Art of the Deal&quot; (246 pages, $19.95), it must be chock full of exciting descriptions of your biggest deals. How about telling us about your first one?    &quot;My father and I . . . got the project without putting down any money of our own.&quot;    Then what did you do?    &quot;The next thing we did was rip out the cheap, horrible aluminum front doors . . . and put up beautiful colonial white doors.&quot;    Colonial white doors. Fascinating. How about when you bought the old railroad yards from Penn Central?    &quot;We drew up agreements giving me an exclusive option . . . subject to everything except my having to put up any money.&quot;    Amazing. And Trump Tower?   &quot;I leased 55,000 square feet to Allied {Stores Corp.} . . . for an annual rent of $3 million. . . . In other words, I was paying out $2.5 million {a year} to own the site, and getting $3 million back from Allied for leasing them a small portion of the total space.&quot;    But surely, Mr. Trump, there must have been times when you had to put up some of your own money? Tell us about one of those times.    &quot;On February 5, we signed {quarterback} Doug Flutie to a five year contract -- which I personally guaranteed. I don't like to do that, but a player of Flutie's stature wasn't about to risk signing with {the USFL} unless he had some guarantees.&quot;    You must have been pretty excited when he threw three touchdown passes in the fourth quarter of his first game.    &quot;The day after Flutie's great game, I wrote a letter to Harry Usher, our new commissioner, suggesting that the cost of Flutie's contract be shared among all USFL owners.&quot;    Why is this not a surprise?    But let's move ahead. People are always asking, &quot;How does that Donald Trump bring his buildings in on budget?&quot; What's your secret, sir?    &quot;Value engineering. Say, for example, that your architect shows you a certain door . . . which has four hinges on it. Before you approve the door, you have your engineer look at it, and perhaps he says, 'Look, you only need two hinges.'&quot;    Value engineering -- who'da thunk it. How anyone is going to be able to put this book down is beyond me.    We're running out of space, but I couldn't end this review without asking you to mention some of your rapier insights into the many big shots you've come to know as you've become a big shot yourself. Can you give us a few highlights?    Barron Hilton &quot;is a member of what I call the Lucky Sperm club.&quot; Ed Koch is &quot;a bully, pure and simple.&quot; Gov. Mario Cuomo &quot;is a good guy.&quot; Roy Cohn &quot;was no Boy Scout.&quot; Cardinal John J. O'Connor &quot;is not only a man of great warmth, he's also a businessman with great political instincts.&quot; Harry Helmsley is &quot;more successful and less envious than most of my competitors.&quot;    Well, that's worth $19.95 right there. But maybe you can also let us in on what's ahead for Donald Trump.    &quot;The biggest challenge I see over the next twenty years is to figure out some creative ways to give back some of what I've gotten.&quot;    I can imagine. With the kind of money you've made, that could take a long time.    &quot;I don't just mean money. . . .&quot;    Goodness. Of course not. I don't know what got into me. But listen, good luck with the book. If you buy up enough copies, it's sure to be a best seller.    ---   Mr. Nocera is executive editor of New England Monthly. </TEXT></DOC>
