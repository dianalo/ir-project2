Although administration officials are scrupulously avoiding public statements calling on the Fed to lower interest rates, one official said &quot;it's not something we would look with disfavor on.&quot; Separately, Treasury Assistant Secretary Michael Darby sent a letter to Fed governors and regional reserve bank presidents arguing that weak money growth is posing a risk to the economy.    The administration also is convinced that the recent stability of the dollar gives the Fed room to nudge rates down. &quot;The dollar has shown a pretty good degree of stability in recent weeks,&quot; the administration official said. It's also possible that foreign rates might be eased down as well, preserving the current large difference between U.S. and foreign rates that helps attract foreign investors and support the dollar.    The official said no foreign move is in the works, but he said the subject of interest rates will be among those discussed starting this morning at meetings being held by Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan and Treasury Secretary James Baker with visiting West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg.    While welcoming an easier Fed policy, the administration official, who spoke on the condition that his name not be used, expressed confidence that the U.S. economy would continue to grow in the coming months, although at a somewhat slower pace than last year. &quot;I don't look for a recession,&quot; he said.    But he said that lower interest rates could provide a quick boost to some ailing sectors of the economy, such as housing. And he said any easing by the Fed now would simply be &quot;following the market down.&quot;    As reported last week, Fed officials may soon move to ease credit in the face of signs of weak economic growth. The central bank's policy committee meets next week, but some easing could occur even sooner, it's understood, if signs of weakness persist.    While encouraging the move toward easier policy, Reagan administration officials are trying to avoid any appearance of putting pressure on the Fed. A public attempt to pressure the central bank, they fear, could raise questions about the Fed's independence and make it more difficult for Fed officials to act.    Mr. Darby's letter seemed to push the limits of that policy, and administration officials were quick to say that it wasn't cleared by Treasury Secretary Baker, the administration's point man on economic issues.    The letter, described as a scholarly discussion of the economy, noted that the money supply has shown no growth, after adjustment for inflation, over the past year and that this suggests the economy will slow down.    Gary Stern, president of the Minneapolis Fed, said he couldn't recall ever getting a similar letter from a Treasury official in the past, though he said he didn't &quot;consider it particularly extraordinary&quot; that he got this one.    The administration official said one reason that lower U.S. interest rates shouldn't hurt the dollar is that the U.S. and its trading partners have moved strongly to back up the Dec. 22 seven-nation pact in which they called for a halt to the dollar's decline.    &quot;The speculators got pretty badly burned several weeks ago, and they know that we meant it, that the Dec. 22 agreement was a substantive agreement, that we all feel that way, that it wasn't just rhetoric,&quot; he said.    In addition, the official said, U.S. interest rates now are so far above foreign rates, especially following some recent easing in Japan, that a small cut in the spread might not mean much for the dollar. He also said the dollar's level is currently much lower than it was the last time a reduction in the spread between U.S. and foreign interest rates caused it to fall, just after the Oct. 19 stock market crash.    The official was careful not to predict that any Fed easing might be matched by cuts abroad, and added that German Finance Minister Stoltenberg doesn't run his country's central bank, which sets rates. But he said Mr. Stoltenberg &quot;sees what interest rates are in the U.S. They (West German officials) are not interested in seeing a recession in the U.S. because it will be translated into one over there.&quot;    German officials say that Bonn tends to prefer higher, not lower, U.S. rates to support the dollar. But they add that, if U.S. growth is threatening to slow down more than would be needed to cut the trade deficit, they might support a Fed move to ease.    ---   Rose Gutfeld contributed to this article. </TEXT></DOC>
