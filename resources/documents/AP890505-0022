North's Iran-Contratrial drew a fine distinction between lies told to keep a covertoperation secret and falsehoods offered when the mission was beingpublicly exposed.   The jury dealt a setback to Iran-Contra prosecutors by clearingthe former Marine lieutenant colonel of all charges that he lied toCongress when asked if he was secretly helping arm the Nicaraguanrebels.   But the jury convicted North of helping prepare a falsechronology of the Iran-Contra affair and destroying key documentsonce the covert operation's cover was blown by public disclosures.   Lying was a major theme of the prosecution's case. Prosecutorsargued from the start that deceiving Congress damages democracybecause government only functions properly when the truth is told.   The jury apparently accepted this argument with a caveat _ thatdeception to protect a covert operation might be justified. Jurors,however, did not fully accept North's argument that his actionswere always justified because he had authority from superiors.   ``I think perhaps they drew a distinction between the potentialfor jeopardizing lives and assets while the mission was stillsecret and what occurred after public revelations,'' said RichardBen-Veniste, a Washington criminal lawyer and former Watergateprosecutor.   ``They quite clearly acquitted Oliver North on those areas ofcriminal activity in which he was acting at the behest of theadministration prior to the blowing of the cover on the entireoperation in the fall of 1986,'' said Harvard University lawprofessor Laurence Tribe.   ``Once the cover was blown, his actions in aiding and abettingthe obstruction of Congress and in shredding documents were, Ithink, quite properly deemed criminal.''   North's claim that the verdict is a ``partial vindication'' hassome credibility.   The jury rejected independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh'scontention that North was a liar and a thief but found him guiltyof other misdeeds _ accepting installation of a security systemoutside his home by an arms dealer and destroying officialdocuments once the Iran-Contra affair was publicly known inNovember 1986.   ``You can't say at this juncture that either side walked awaywith their theory intact,'' said Lawrence Barcella, a Washingtoncriminal lawyer and a former federal prosecutor.   Lead prosecutor John Keker noted that North was convicted ofthree ``serious felony charges,'' insisting that ``the principlethat no man is above the law has been vindicated.''   ``There is something there for everyone,'' Ben-Veniste said.   The jury appeared to have both accepted and rejected North'sdefense that he was only acting on orders from above _ dependingupon the circumstances.   It cleared him of a charge of lying to House IntelligenceCommittee members in August 1986 _ apparently accepting North'sexplanation that he only met with lawmakers at the insistence ofthen-national security adviser John Poindexter.   The jury, however, convicted North of aiding and abetting theobstruction of Congress by helping Poindexter and the late CIADirector William Casey prepare a false chronology of theIran-Contra affair in November 1986.   ``It appears to be a very fact-bound decision,'' Barcella said.   The jury cleared North of a charge he pocketed $4,300 of the$90,000 worth of travelers checks given to him by a Contra leaderto cover expenses.   Yet it convicted the former presidential aide of illegallyaccepting installation of a security system outside his home byarms dealer Richard V. Secord.   On this count, jurors appeared to hold North accountable becausehe admitted trying to cover up the gift by fabricating evidence hepaid for the $13,800 security gate.   Again, the jury objected to a coverup not justified by nationalsecurity considerations.   ``It really reflects much more the jury's probable dismay at thefalsification of bills, preparation of false letters _ again acoverup,'' said Tribe.   ``We have here an example of a very careful jury, certainly nota hanging jury, drawing a very careful distinctions,'' he said.   The verdict, he added, undercuts ``the elitist assumption thatsome have made that a group of not very well educated people whowere ignorant of the Iran-Contra hearings somehow couldn't draw thelines required.''</TEXT><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE><TEXT>   James Rowley covers the Justice Department forThe Associated Press.</TEXT></DOC>
