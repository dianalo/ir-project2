Dorsey R. Gardner, who was named a director three months ago, resigned this week, saying he intended to &quot;solicit, initiate or encourage&quot; other bids for Purolator, a package delivery concern based in Basking Ridge, N.J.    In his resignation letter, which the company submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission, Mr. Gardner said he resigned because he believes &quot;shareholder values could be enhanced if one or more industrial purchasers could be induced to bid for all or portions of the business.&quot;    As previously reported, Purolator's directors recently agreed to a $35-a-share leveraged buyout proposal made by a group of officers and a unit of E.F. Hutton Group Inc.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Purolator closed at $36.25, up $1.    In a leveraged buyout, a small group of investors acquires a company in a transaction financed largely with borrowings. Ultimately, the debt is paid with funds generated by the acquired company's operations or the sale of its assets.    In a telephone interview yesterday, Mr. Gardner said he thinks the buyout proposal is &quot;a terrible deal for shareholders.&quot; He said Purolator is seriously underestimating the value of the unprofitable U.S. Courier division, which posted an operating loss of $73 million on revenue of $453 million in 1986.    &quot;They're selling that off for $50 million to $60 million,&quot; he said. &quot;I think it's worth more.&quot;    Purolator, which has been cutting costs in an effort to turn the division around, expects it to turn a profit this year, he said. &quot;E.F. Hutton will be about to pull out the money it invested and an additional $10 million or $20 million from the business in four months' time,&quot; he said.    Mr. Gardner wouldn't disclose whether he has any potential suitors. Under the company's agreement with the buyout group, directors are barred from seeking competing offers, Purolator said in a filing with the SEC.    Mr. Gardner is president and chief executive officer of Kelso Management Co. in Boston. Kelso Management is an investment adviser to Fidelity Investments, a Boston-based money management concern.    Last week, Halcyon Investments, a New York investment concern, said it raised its stake in Purolator to the equivalent of 9.51% of its common outstanding.    Michael J. Walker, an analyst with the brokerage firm Legg Mason Inc. in Baltimore, said he thinks Mr. Gardner is &quot;one of the few people in (Purolator) that the shareholders can rely on.&quot;    He said he agrees with the former director's assessment that the division may have a greater value than the company has estimated. Mr. Walker said the U.S. Courier division has been up for sale for some time. While he was a director, Mr. Gardner probably would have been privy to the same feedback from potential buyers as management, Mr. Walker said. &quot;He's seen the same information they've seen&quot; and he's come to a different conclusion about the division's worth, Mr. Walker said.    Purolator and Hutton declined to comment yesterday.    The management-led group is offering shareholders an opportunity to purchase stock in a subsidiary of the new concern the group plans to form. Under terms of the buyout offer, shareholders would get warrants to buy 15% of the stock of a subsidiary that would own Purolator's domestic operations. But Mr. Walker characterized the warrants as &quot;a bone they are tossing shareholders.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
