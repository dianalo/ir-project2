A preliminary statement by Rosa Chavez said the sides had reachedan accord on how to prepare the meetings and on participation of thechurch in the talks. He said substantive themes would be discussedat the next meeting. The current round of talks began Wednesday witha two-day schedule, but the two sides were still negotiating lateinto the night Thursday on a final statement. Rosa Chavez said he``had the impression'' the future meetings would be held on amonthly basis and that they would include international observers.He added that the talks would take place inside and outside ElSalvador.   Earlier in the day, the Marxist rebels and U.S.-backed governmentargued about the pace of peace talks to end the war, which has taken70,000 lives.   One rebel leader, Shafick Handal, told reporters the government'sconcern for procedural matters was ``very restrictive.''   Fighting continued in El Salvador, despite a unilateral trucedeclared by the guerrillas. Army spokesmen in San Salvador said fourguerrillas were killed, two guerrillas and one soldier were wounded,a helicopter was damaged and two buses were torched.   In San Salvador, Col. Orlando Zepeda, the vice minister ofdefense, called the rebel proposal to reorganize and reduce the sizeof the armed forces a thinly disguised attempt to seize power. ``Wecontinue to be the object of Marxist aggression,'' Zepeda said.   Government representatives had insisted that procedural issues besettled first, setting aside discussion of a rebel offer to lay downtheir arms and reorganize as a political party in exchange fordemocratic reforms.   Sources for both sides also said they were divided on whethersome negotiating sessions should take place without the presence ofobservers or Roman Catholic Church mediators.   The guerrillas made the proposal Wednesday in their first talkswith the government in two years.   El Salvador's government has not presented a peace plan, but thefive-man delegation arrived with a proposal calling for two days oftalks every two months.   Rebels leaders said they want a faster-paced negotiating plan.   Both sides say they want to end the war.   Salvadoran Ambassador Sigfrido Munes Cruz told reporters Thursdaythat the rebel proposal shows ``a new attitude, a more realisticattitude.''   Munes is not a member of the government delegation, but he saidhe feels optimistic.   The meeting is the first between the rebels and the electedRepublican Nationalist Alliance government of President AlfredoCristiani, who took office June 1 after elections boycotted by theinsurgents.   The rebels' peace proposal calls for a cease-fire by Nov. 15 inexchange for broad reforms, including appointing a new Supreme Courtand justice minister and moving up legislative and municipalelections scheduled for 1991.   The guerrillas also say a truce is conditional on militaryreorganization, including a reduction in the number of troops,expanded land reform and the prosecution of death squad members.   Roberto d'Aubuisson, founder of Cristiani's party, has beenaccused of playing a key role in rightist death squads that havemurdered thousands of leftists, suspected leftists and othergovernment opponents.   Under the final stage of their proposal, the guerrillas call forconstitutional and electoral reforms and U.S. agreement to replacemilitary aid to the Salvadoran government with economic aid.   El Salvador is the largest recipient of U.S. aid in thehemisphere.   The rebel plan contains many proposals rejected before, but thewording this time is much milder and the rebels have dropped alongstanding insistence on merging their army with the govermentarmed forces.   Their offer to become a political party also is new.   Negotiations in 1984 and 1987 failed.</TEXT></DOC>
