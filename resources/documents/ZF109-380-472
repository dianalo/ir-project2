 The System/390 announcement included:andM;-    Enterprise System/9000 family of processors--a singleandM;line ofair-and-water-cooled processors (18 models inandM;all)andM;-; Enterprise System Architecture/390--specificallyandM;designed for the S/390 environment, including:andM;-    Enterprise Systems Connection Architecture (ESCON)andM;with fiber-optic channels and a range of newandM;products said to enhance systems planning andandM;implementation flexibility and provide for lessandM;disruptive dynamic configuration changeandM;-    IBM Common Cryptographic Architecture--featuringandM;new levels of system, network, and workstationandM;securityandM;-    A new architecture--providing data spaces for theandM;VM environmentandM;-    MVS/ESA, VM/ESA, VSE/ESA--Enterprise SystemsandM;Architecture throughout a family of new operatingandM;systemsandM;-    3172 Interconnect Controller and VTAM enhancements--forandM;improved local-area network (LAN) integration andandM;management, including links to remote systemsandM;-    IBM SystemView--designed to enhance the management ofandM;systems and provide a blueprint for systems managementandM;productsandM;-    Functions, features, and applications for the S/390andM;environmentandM;New IBM network products designed to enhance system management capabilitiesand provide more flexible networking design alternatives were also announcedon September 5, including such LAN management products as the IBM LAN NetworkManager versions 1.0 and 1.1, IBM LAN Network Manager Entry, IBM LAN StationManager, and the IBM 8230 Controlled Access Unit.andM;The new IBM LAN-to-LAN Wide-Area Network Program offers the ability toconnect local-area networks over a corporate wide-area network backbonewithout host interaction.andP;  Improvements were made to the IBM 8209 LAN Bridgefor Ethernet and new support provided for IBM Token-Ring-to-Token-Ringattachment, through the 8209.andP;  Also, a new release of the IBM LANAsynchronous Connection Server extends the access for ASCII terminals to usethe LAN for host sessions, as well as LAN applications.andM;The announcements are summarized below.andM;LAN Management Enhancements.andP;  IBM has continued to develop products designedto simplify network management and provide information to help with thistask.andP;  By working with the IBM 8230 Controlled Access Unit and the IBMStation Manager, the IBM LAN Network Manager products provide controlledaccess to the LAN and information on LAN-attached devices for LANcustomization and management.andP;  Releases 1.0 and 1.1 of IBM LAN NetworkManager and LAN Network Manager Entry are designed to provide expandedcapabilities to manage LAN-attached devices over the IBM LAN Manager productsthat they replace.andP;  The highlights of these new products are summarized inthe following paragraphs.andM;IBM LAN Network Manager provides the capability to manage multi-segment IBMToken-Ring Networks, broadband and baseband IBM PC Networks, and the IBM 8209LAN Bridge that interconnects Token-Ring and Ethernet segments.andP;  Using thisprogram, the LAN can be managed either centrally from an enterprise NetViewor locally using the operator interface at the LAN workstation.andM;Release 1.0 of LAN Network Management includes OS/2 operating system databasesupport for LAN management data, a new OS/2 Presentation Manager userinterface, 8230 access control, alert filtering improvements to reduce LANtraffic forwarded to NetView, and improved LAN recovery through auto-relinkto a bridge.andP;  The OS/2 database support includes a database file conversionprogram, user query through SQL, and user reports.andM;Release 1.1 of IBM LAN Network Manager provides expanded host control fromNetView by allowing NetView operators to use more than 80 commands to supportremote Token-Ring Network LAN users or for multi-segment bridged LANs in asingle location from a central system.andP;  Other enhancements include theability to automate LAN Network Manager commands, optional graphics supportfrom LAN Network Manager via GraphicsView/2, LAN Station Manager support, andsupport for the IBM 8209 LAN Bridge Token-Ring feature.andM;IBM LAN Network Manager Entry provides functions similar to LAN NetworkManager version 1.1.andP;  It is said to provide significant cost savings forcentrally managed LANs with NetView, where a local LAN operator interface isnot needed.andM;IBM LAN Station Manager provides asset management, configuration, and otherworkstation data to IBM LAN Network Manager for improved auditability, LANadministration, and security.andM;The IBM 8230 Controlled Access Unit (CAU) is a powered unit for attachingdevices to an IBM Token-Ring Network designed to increase wiring flexibilityand simplify network design.andP;  Features of the 8230 CAU include the following:andM;-    Support for both shielded and unshielded cabling.andM;-    Switchable from 16 Mbps to 4 Mbps.andM;-    Base unit functions as a repeater in both directions.andM;-    Supports copper and fiber-optic cabling.andM;-    Accommodates up to 80 workstations in increments of 20andM;attachments per module and up to four modules attachedandM;to one base unitandM;-    Automatic error recovery.andM;-    Provides for greater cabling distances than availableandM;with the 8228 IBM 8209 LAN Bridge for Ethernet.andM;New enhancements to the 8209 LAN Bridge for Ethernet are intended to protectthe investment in LAN products while providing more options for growth.andO;Using the IBM 8209, customers can use their existing LANs while addingtoken-ring backbones or departmental token-rings to their enterprise.andM;Enhancements to the Ethernet feature include token-ring network managementinformation supported across an IEEE 802.3 or Ethernet LAN segment and newfilters to minimize traffic on the LAN backbone.andM;IBM 8209 LAN Bridge--Token-Ring.andM;This  new &quot;plug-and-play&quot; feature gives users more network designoptions--e.g., a local bridge can now be installed in places which previouslycould not accommodate a PS/2.andM;The new IBM 8209 Token-Ring-to-Token-Ring feature provides the followingcapabilities:andM;-    Installs in a wiring closet, eliminating the need for aandM;PS/2, hard disk, and keyboard for a local token-ringandM;bridgeandM;-    Combines functions and network management capabilitiesandM;of the IBM Token-Ring Network Bridge Program with theandM;8209andM;-    Provides higher performance than the IBM Token-RingandM;Bridge Program for frames less than 2KandM;-    Supplies network management information to IBM LANandM;Network Manager version 1.1andM;IBM LAN-to-LAN Wide-Area Network ProgramandM;With the evolution of token-ring networks as an integral part of manyenterprises, there is a critical need, says IBM, to provide the capability toconnect multiple token-rings using an already established Systems NetworkArchitecture (SNA) or X.25 backbone.andP;  The IBM LAN-to-LAN Wide-Area NetworkProgram provides this option with the following features:andM;-    Allows connection of LANs across a wide-area networkandM;(WAN) without host interactionandM;-    Applications written to use IEEE 802.2 and IBMandM;NETBIOS--such as the IBM OS/2 LAN Server--will be ableandM;to communicate with remote Token-Ring LANs using anandM;existing SNA or X.25 wide-area connectionandM;-    Systems management and security provided by controllingandM;which client and server workstations may communicateandM;with each otherandM;IBM LAN Asynchronous Connection Server (LANACS)andM;The IBM LANACS product provides LAN access for ASCII terminals to IBM andother hosts using a variety of terminal emulation programs.andP;  By providingthis capability through the IBM Token-Ring LAN, IBM has extended thenetworking design options available to its customers.andP;  With the new releaseof IBM LANACS, the following features are now available:andM;-    3270 emulation for ASCII terminals to a TCP/IP host.andM;-    Access to non-IBM TCP/IP ASCII hosts not requiring 3270andM;emulation.andM;-    DOS workstations on an IBM Token-Ring Network,andM;Ethernet, or IBM PC Network can use windows to access aandM;LANACS gateway for communication with LAN applicationsandM;-    Graphical user interface for installation andandM;configuration New management functions to view andandM;control asynchronous connections on the LANACS serverandM;As usual with IBM new product announcements, local IBM sales representativehave additional information on the new offerings.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
