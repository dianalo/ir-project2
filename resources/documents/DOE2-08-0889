The program was developed toattend the needs of safety at the actual stage of the Rapid Reactor Programof IEN/CNEN. The objectives are to calculate the sodium pool temperaturefrom a lenkage, the combustion time and aerosol concentration at theinner atmosphere of the ''Sodium Loop Facility'', in case of hipotheticalaccident with sodium fire. Is also presented the combustion kineticsand the methods to calculate the amount of heat generated, the amountof heat lost and the aerosol concentration. The results calculated bythe computer code are compared with the values obtained from fires experiences,that were simulations in scale of 1:1000 of the facilities.</TEXT></DOC>
