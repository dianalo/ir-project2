The first component consists offilamentary, narrow-line emission organized into a bipolar outflow overthe surfaces of two elongated bubbles. We present direct evidence fora second component of broad-line and continuum emission arising froma faint exponential halo that rotates slowly with the disk.</TEXT></DOC>
