These types of films have been utilized in a      wide variety of applications, such as in the preparation of synthetic      leather, in the preparation of cloth laminates for use as synthetic shoes,      raincoats, outer wear, camping equipment such as tents, and the like, and      in combination with fabrics and other materials for preparation of medical      applications such as surgical gowns, bandages, and the like, and      applications such as house wrap, covers for automobiles and other      motorized vehicles, and the like. </PAR><PAR>  A variety of porous stretched polymeric films are known in the art. In      general, there are three types of processes used to produce porous,      melt-processed polymeric films including a stretching step. These three      types are processes for stretching films of neat, unblended polymers      containing no fillers, other than typical stabilizing additives; processes      for making films from blends of two or more polymers, or from blends of      polymer with mineral oil or an organic salt in which the dispersed phase      is extracted with the film stretched before or after the extraction; and      processes for producing films from blends of polymer with a filler such as      calcium carbonate or barium sulfate with the film stretched after casting      and without extraction. </PAR><PAR>  Commonly assigned U.S. Pat.

The aesthetic characteristics of      these polypropylene porous films have a somewhat stiffer nature or harsher      hand relative to porous film made from synthetic materials other than      polypropylene and that they have a tendency to produce a &quot;rustling&quot; noise      when flexed. </PAR><PAR>  Commonly assigned U.S. Pat.

These homopolymers or random copolymers of propylene have at      least 40% crystallinity and typically at least 50% crystallinity as      determined by x-ray diffraction analysis. The polypropylene component can      have any degree of polymerization so long as the resulting polymeric      composition is capable of being melt-extruded into a film, although it is      preferable that the polypropylene component have a MFR of about 1.0 to      about 30 dg/min measured at 230.degree. C. under a load of 2.16 kg as      specified by ASTM D1238. Polymeric compositions having polypropylenes with      a MFR of less than 1.0 or greater than 30 dg/min generally are not easily      converted into oriented polymeric microporous films having desirable      strength and breathability properties. For ease of processing and      production of porous films with desirable properties, a particularly      preferred range of MFR is about 2.0  to about 5.0 dg/min. </PAR><PAR>  The low molecular weight polypropylene component of the polymeric      compositions comprises a polypropylene homopolymer having a weight average      molecular weight in the range of about 30,000 to about 100,000.      Particularly preferred is low molecular weight polypropylene (LMWPP)      having a melt viscosity of about 50 to about 1,000 poise when measured at      a shear rate of 136 sec.sup.-1 and a temperature of 190.degree. C., and      most preferred is a polypropylene having a melt viscosity of about 70 to      about 550 poise measured at the same conditions. It is contemplated that      the low molecular weight polypropylene component can also be provided by      the homopolymer or random copolymer of propylene component when such      component has such a broad molecular weight distribution that the portion      of low molecular weight polypropylene required in the polymeric      composition is included in the amount of low molecular weight material of      the polypropylene component. Copolymers of .alpha.-olefins such as      ethylene, butene and mixtures of these with propylene and other modified      ethylene polymers such as impact modifiers, ethylene-propylene rubber,      ethylene methyl acrylate, ethylene vinyl acetate, and the like, as well as      polybutene can replace a part, usually less than 50%, of the low molecular      weight polypropylene component. Suitable low molecular weight      polypropylenes can be made by known techniques and also are commercially      available, for example, from Polyvisions Inc. as Proflow-1000 and      Proflow-3000. </PAR><PAR>  In addition to the polymer components of the polymeric compositions of this      invention, nonpolymeric components such as beta-spherulite nucleating      agents and inorganic fillers such as calcium carbonate can also be      present. Commonly assigned U.S. Pat. No. 4,975,469 and the references      cited therein, incorporated herein by reference, disclose beta-spherulite      nucleating agents such as the gamma-crystalline form of a quinacridone      colorant, the bisodium salt of orthophthalic acid, the aluminum salt of      6-quinizarin sulfonic acid and to a lesser degree isophthalic and      terephthalic acids. The nucleating agents are typically used in the form      of powdered solids. To produce beta-spherulites efficiently the powder      particles of the nucleating agent should be less than 5 microns in      diameter and preferably no greater than 1 micron in diameter. The      preferred beta-spherulite nucleating agent that may be used in the      polymeric compositions of this invention is the gamma-crystalline form of      a quinacridone colorant. One form of the quinacridone colorant is red      quinacridone dye, hereinafter also referred to as &quot;Q-dye&quot;, having the      structural formula      ##STR1## </PAR><PAR>  The inorganic fillers which can optionally be used in the polymeric      compositions of this invention are solid inorganic metal salt particles      which are non-hygroscopic, light-colored, water insoluble, highly pure,      easily pulverized, finely divided, and have densities below 3.0 g/cc and      melting points above polymer degradation temperatures. Calcium carbonate      particles, which are preferred, can be in any suitable naturally occurring      or man-made form. Naturally occurring forms include the rather pure      crystals of calcite with a hexagonal geometric form and aragonite with an      orthorhombic geometric form. The melting point of greater than 800.degree.      C. for calcium carbonate is in excess of any temperatures that might      typically be used, even momentarily, to process thermoplastic polymers.      The calcite form of calcium carbonate has a rating of 3 on the Moh's Scale      of Hardness, barely above gypsum, and this degree of softness permits easy      and rapid pulverizing. Suitable man-made, highly pure, commercially      available forms of calcium carbonate include precipitated chalk and the      like with very finely divided, pure particles in the range of 0.05 to 10      microns. Preferably, calcium carbonate with average particle size of about      0.1 to about 10 microns is used in the polymeric compositions of this      invention to form highly breathable porous film. Calcium carbonate is      aptly described as &quot;water insoluble&quot; in that it cannot be dissolved in      deionized water to a sufficient extent to form a 0.1 wt % aqueous solution      at 23.degree. C. Even at temperatures up to 100.degree. C., the maximum      solubility of CaCO.sub.3 in deionized water is about 0.002 wt %. Calcium      carbonate is sensitive to acid, but is generally non-reactive with      polymers such as polyolefins and polyurethanes or with organic materials      such as plasticizers; it is, for all practical purposes, substantially      neutral in organic media. </PAR><PAR>  Calcium carbonate is non-hygroscopic in the sense that it does not pick up      moisture from the air, and particles of this salt do not have a tendency      to &quot;cake&quot; or agglomerate due to absorbed moisture. Commercial grades of      sodium chloride, for example, are generally too hygroscopic to be      conveniently used in this invention. The specific gravity of hexagonal      calcium carbonate is only slightly above 2.7, and all forms of the salt      have a specific gravity of less than 3. </PAR><PAR>  Other inorganic salts with properties similar to calcium carbonate, e.g.,      the alkaline earth metal carbonates and sulfates of low solubility such as      magnesium carbonate, calcium sulfate and barium sulfate can be substituted      for calcium carbonate. Generally, however, these other salts lack one or      more of the advantages of calcium carbonate. Barium sulfate is water      insoluble, soft with a Moh's Hardness value of 2.5 to 3.5, very high      melting, and generally white or light colored in finely divided form, but      its specific gravity of almost 4.5 detracts from the prospect of making      light weight films which contain high loadings of unbleached filler.      Calcium sulfate is low in hardness, low in density, light in color, and      very high melting, but is more water soluble than calcium carbonate. Being      capable of acidic behavior, this salt is not neutral and may react with      some organic polymers at elevated temperatures. Magnesium carbonate is      more neutral and water insoluble, but is slightly harder, slightly denser,      and subject to decomposition at relatively low temperatures, e.g.,      350.degree. to 400.degree. C. </PAR><PAR>  It is within the scope of the polymeric compositions of this invention to      use inorganic fillers having a variety of colors, or to add color to them.      Calcite, for example, occurs naturally in a wide variety of colors. The      inorganic filler can act as a pore or channel forming agent as well as a      pigmentation agent. By adding small amounts of calcium carbonate to the      polymeric compositions of this invention, the breathability of the      oriented film is enhanced by the action of polymer pulling away from the      calcium carbonate to create voids during orientation. The particles of      CaCO.sub.3, after stretching, are located within the walls defining the      pores or otherwise associated with the porous film structure, and can      impart both color and opacity to the oriented polymeric microporous films. </PAR><PAR>  In preparing the polymeric compositions of this invention, the composition      components can be added to conventional blenders such as roll mills, drum      tumblers, double-cone blenders, ribbon blenders, and the like, or any two      or more of the components can be preblended or formed into a masterbatch      and mixed with the remaining components in conventional blenders. The      beta-spherulite nucleating agent generally in the form of powder can be      dispersed in mixtures of polymeric components by any of the procedures      normally used in the polymer art to ensure uniform mixing of powder and      polymer resin. For example, the Q-dye in powder form can be blended with      the polymer components in powder or pellet form or the Q-dye can be      slurried in an inert medium and the slurry used to coat the polymer powder      or pellets. Alternatively, mixing at elevated temperatures can be      accomplished by using, for example, a roll mill or multiple passes through      a melt-compounding extruder. A preferred mixing procedure is the blending      of the nucleating agent in powder form with polymer pellets or powder      followed by melt-compounding the resulting mixture in a single-screw or      multiple-screw extruder. Multiple passes may be necessary to ensure the      desired level of dispersion of nucleating agent in the polymer. This      procedure can also be used to form a masterbatch of nucleating agent and      polymer. It is important that a homogeneous composition be formed so that      films obtained from the polymeric composition have a uniform distribution      of the polymer components and beta-spherulite nucleating agent in order      that oriented polymeric microporous films with uniform strength and      breathability are obtained. </PAR><PAR>  For polymeric compositions of this invention which are capable of being      converted into an oriented polymeric microporous film by a process      including the extractive removal of beta-spherulites to form a porous film      with a subsequent orientation step, the polymeric composition comprises      about 5 to about 30 parts by weight of the ethylene-propylene block      copolymer, about 70 to about 95 parts by weight of the polypropylene      homopolymer or random copolymer of propylene and about 0.1 to about 10 ppm      of the beta-spherulite nucleating agent. Porous films prepared by this      process from compositions containing less than 5 parts by weight of the      ethylene-propylene block copolymer do not exhibit the improved aesthetic      qualities such as softer hand and decreased noise generation when flexed,      whereas films prepared from compositions containing more than 30 parts by      weight of the ethylene-propylene block copolymer do not exhibit sufficient      porosity. Oriented porous films prepared from compositions comprising      about 5 to about 30 parts by weight of the ethylene-propylene block      copolymer by a process including the formation of a porous film by the      extractive removal of beta-spherulites from a film containing      beta-spherulites with subsequent orienting of the porous film have      improved aesthetic qualities such as a softer hand and decreased noise      generation when flexed and good breathability properties as measured by      the MVTR. </PAR><PAR>  The amount of beta-spherulite nucleant useful in forming porous films by      the extractive removal of beta-spherulite technique from the polymeric      compositions of this invention depends on the effectiveness of the      particular nucleant for inducing beta-crystals and the amount of porosity      desired in the porous film produced from the composition. For Q-dye, the      amount present in the polymeric compositions can range from about 0.01 to      about 50 ppm by weight. Sufficient nucleating agent is employed to induce      the formation of 20 wt % or more of beta-spherulites in the film.      Preferably, about 0.1 to about 10 ppm by weight of Q-dye is utilized.      Other things being equal, less than about 0.01 ppm of Q-dye has a      negligible effect on the level of beta-form spherulites present in the      film, and amounts greater than 50 ppm do not significantly increase the      amount of beta-spherulites formed. For compositions with about 0.1 to      about 10 ppm of Q-dye acting as a nucleating agent and formed into a film,      a sufficient amount of beta-spherulites is formed in the film such that a      high porosity film is formed when the film is extracted with toluene,      carbon tetrachloride or xylene. With a subsequent orientation step, a film      having increased porosity and breathability is formed. </PAR><PAR>  For compositions including a beta-spherulite nucleating agent, a critical      parameter in the formation of beta-spherulites in the film is the rate at      which the film is cooled. Other parameters being equivalent, the more      rapid the cooling, the smaller the size of the beta-spherulites formed. If      the molten film is cooled too rapidly, it is possible that essentially no      beta-spherulites are formed. Conversely, the slower the film is cooled,      the larger the size of the beta-spherulites formed. Little or no      beta-spherulites are formed below about 80.degree. C. or above about      130.degree. C. The cooling conditions needed to achieve the desired      beta-spherulite size can be controlled by one or more of the following      parameters: polymer melt temperature, extrusion rate, drawdown ratio, die      gap and chill roll temperature for extruded film, and cooling air velocity      and temperature for blown film. Other things being equal, an increase in      one of the following parameters results in a decrease in the rate at which      the molten film is cooled or quenched and, consequently, an increase in      the size of the beta-spherulites formed: polymer melt temperature,      extrusion rate, die gap, cooling air temperature, and chill roll      temperature. Conversely, other things being equal, a decrease in one of      these variables results in a decrease in the size of the beta-spherulites.      By contrast, other things being equal, an increase in either the drawdown      ratio or cooling air velocity results in an increase in the quench rate      and an associated decrease in the size of the beta-spherulites formed. </PAR><PAR>  For polymeric compositions of this invention capable of being formed into      microporous films by a process including the extraction of      beta-spherulites from formed films, the film is ordinarily at least about      0.005 millimeters in thickness. The useful maximum thickness depends on      the time of extraction of the beta-spherulites. Other things being equal,      the thicker the film, the longer the time required to extract a given      percentage of the total beta-spherulites present. The beta-spherulites      formed in the film can be extracted with nonpolar, organic solvents. For      ease of operation, it is preferred that the extracting medium have a      boiling point greater than about 100.degree. C. It is possible to utilize      mixtures of two or more organic solvents and in such an event the lower      boiling solvent should have a boiling point greater than about 100.degree.      C. Preferred extraction solvents include toluene, carbon tetrachloride,      and xylene, with toluene being most preferred. Any conventional extractive      technique used in the extraction of films can be used. Particularly useful      are processes which include temperature- and environment-controlled      extraction vessels which permit complete immersion of the films in the      extraction solvent at a controlled temperature and under conditions in      which any extraction solvent vapors are contained. </PAR><PAR>  The extraction conditions are critical in selectively removing at least a      portion of the beta-spherulites while minimizing the amount of alpha-form      crystalline polypropylene removed. Removal of the beta-form crystals is      very temperature dependent. If the extraction temperature is too low, the      beta-spherulites are removed too slowly or not at all; and, if the      extraction temperature is too high, alpha-form crystals are dissolved      along with the beta-form. The optimum temperature of extraction depends on      the particular extraction medium used and can be readily determined by one      skilled in the art. For the preferred extracting medium, toluene, the      extraction is preferably accomplished in the temperature range of about      85.degree. to about 95.degree. C., most preferably about 88.degree. to      about 93.degree. C. It has also been found that for films containing      cornstarch extraction temperatures of about 3.degree. to 5.degree. C. less      can be used. </PAR><PAR>  The extraction time, used herein to mean the time the film contacts the      extracting medium at the extraction temperature, relates to the extraction      temperature. Other things being equal, the higher the extraction      temperature, the shorter the extraction time; conversely, the lower the      extraction temperature the longer the film must be in contact with the      extraction medium to remove a given amount of beta-spherulites. The length      of the extraction time can be used to control the degree of porosity to      some extent since at a given extraction temperature greater quantities of      the beta-spherulites can remain in the film as the extraction time is      decreased. It is preferred that at least 15 wt % of the beta-spherulites      be extracted as measured by weight loss in the extracted film. The      extraction time also depends on the thickness of the film being extracted.      At a given temperature, the extraction time increases as the film becomes      thicker. Ordinarily the extraction time ranges from about 1.5 to about 20      minutes. Preferably, the extraction time is 10 minutes or less. </PAR><PAR>  The extracted film can be dryed at a drying station to remove any      extraction solvent which remains with the film. The drying station can be      any conventional means used to remove materials such as extraction      solvents. Devices such as radiant heaters can be employed with the      preferred drying method utilizing a blower for impinging heated air on the      film. With both the drying station and the extraction vessel,      environmental procedures involved in handling extraction solvents and      their vapors are utilized. It is preferred that extraction vessels and the      drying stations be contained in a housing equipped with exhaust and      volatiles treatment facilities to minimize loss of the extraction solvent      to the environment. </PAR><PAR>  In the orienting step, the extracted, porous film can be stretched      uniaxially or biaxially at stretch ratios of about 1.5 to about 7.5.      Uniaxial stretching methods include rolls, and a roll or tenter for      restraining the film. Biaxial stretching methods include successive      uniaxially stretching comprising longitudinal stretching by rolls and      transverse stretching by a tenter and simultaneous biaxial stretching      using a tenter. For biaxial stretching, the stretch ratio in the      longitudinal or machine direction and transverse direction may be the same      or different. Preferably the thickness of oriented films produced from the      polymeric compositions of this invention ranges from about 0.005      millimeters to about 0.2 millimeters in thickness. The unstretched porous      films from which the oriented films are formed range in thickness from      about 0.01 to about 0.4 millimeters. </PAR><PAR>  With reference to FIG. 1, a polymeric composition of about 70 to about 95      wt % of propylene, about 5 to about 30 wt % of an ethylene-propylene block      copolymer having about 10 to about 50 wt % ethylene and a beta-spherulite      nucleant is formed into a melt in extruder 2. The melt temperature is in      the range of about 180.degree. to about 270.degree. C., preferably about      200.degree. to about 240.degree. C. The melt is fed into a slot die 4 from      which the melt is extruded as a film. Commonly, the slot die opening      ranges from about 0.25 to about 1.2 millimeters. As the extruded film      emerges from the die and starts to cool, it contacts a chill roll 10 and      is cooled further by chill roll 10 maintained at a temperature of about      80.degree. to about 130.degree. C. The polymer melt temperature, extrusion      rate, drawdown ratio, slot die opening and chill roll temperature can be      used to control the rate of cooling the film and thereby the size of the      beta-spherulites as discussed hereinabove. </PAR><PAR>  The flat film tube 14 passes into an extraction vessel 16 which contains a      non-polar solvent 18 used to selectively extract the beta-spherulites. A      series of rollers 20 are used to maintain tension in the film. The      extraction vessel 16 can be equipped with a heating means (not shown),      such as steam traced lines or the extraction vessel 16 can be immersed in      a temperature controlled bath containing liquids such as silicone oil,      capable of maintaining the extraction solvent at the desired extraction      temperature. Any commercially available controlling means can be employed      to control the temperature of the extracting solvent preferably to within      0.5.degree. C. The extraction vessel 16 can also be equipped with a means      (not shown) for introducing fresh extraction solvent into the vessel and      removing spent solvent containing dissolved resin from the vessel. The      spent solvent can be diverted into a recovery section (not shown) where      the solvent can be separated from the dissolved resin, for example, by      flashing the solvent and condensing the vapor. The recovered polymer,      containing nucleant, can be blended in appropriate amounts with fresh base      resin and used to produce film. </PAR><PAR>  The extracted film is transported through a drying station 22 utilizing a      blower for impinging heated air on the film to remove any extraction      solvent which remains with the film. With both the drying station and the      extraction vessel, environmental procedures involved in handling      extraction solvents and their vapors are utilized. It is preferred that      both the extraction vessel 16 and the drying station 22 be contained in a      housing equipped with the appropriate exhaust and volatiles treatment      facilities to minimize loss of the extraction solvent to the environment. </PAR><PAR>  The dried film is heated by heating rolls 26 to a temperature of about      110.degree. to about 135.degree. C. for about 2 to about 20 seconds before      being oriented on a tenter stretcher 28. The stretching can be uniaxial or      biaxial at stretch ratios of about 1.5 to about 7.5. The oriented porous      film is wound onto a take-up roll 30. </PAR><PAR>  In a particular embodiment, an oriented polymeric porous film having      polygonal cells with average greatest dimensions of about 5 to about 30      microns and interconnecting pores between the cells having average      diameters of about 0.2 to about 20 microns is formed by the process      comprising the steps of: </PAR><PAR>  (a) forming a film comprising a blend of polypropylene, about 5 to about 30      wt % of an ethylene-propyleneblock copolymer having an ethylene content of      about 10 to about 50 wt % and a nucleating agent capable of producing      beta-spherulites; </PAR><PAR>  (b) cooling said film below the crystallization temperature of said blend      to form at least 20 wt % of beta-spherulites in the film; </PAR><PAR>  (c) extracting selectivity said beta-spherulites in an amount corresponding      to at least 15 wt % of the blend from the cooled film with an extraction      solvent to form a porous film; and </PAR><PAR>  (d) orienting the porous film by heating the porous film at a temperature      of about 110.degree. to about 135.degree. C. and stretching the heated      porous film in at least one direction at a stretch ratio of about 1.5 to      about 7.5. </PAR><PAR>  Modifiers added to polypropylene to improve the aesthetic characteristics      of porous films included: a triblock copolymer with polystyrene endblock      with unsaturated rubbery center block of either polyisoprene or      polybutadiene, a triblock copolymer with polystyrene endblock with      saturated rubbery center block of ethylene-propylene or ethylene-butylene      random copolymer, a blend of polypropylene with crosslinked rubber, low      viscosity and high viscosity polybutene. Thermal properties of these      compositions were characterized via differential scanning calorimetry and      cast films were characterized by X-ray diffraction analysis in order to      quantify the level of beta crystallinity present. An empirical parameter      &quot;K&quot;, a measure of the beta crystallinity of the polymer, was measured by      X-ray diffraction analysis and determined according to the equation: </PAR><EQU>  Kandequals;H.beta..sub.1 /(H.beta..sub.1 andplus;(H.delta..sub.1 andplus;H.delta..sub.2      andplus;H.delta..sub.3)) </EQU><PAL>  where H.beta..sub.1, H.delta..sub.1, H.delta..sub.2 and H.delta..sub.3 are      the reflection intensities of the (300) plane of the beta crystals and the      (100), (040) and (130) planes of the alpha crystals, respectively. The      value of K varies from 0 to 1 for films that contain all alpha or all beta      crystals, respectively. The beta-spherulite content of the cast film as      measured by the value of K generally increased as the nucleant      concentration increased from 1 to 4 ppm. </PAL><PAR>  The highest K value was obtained for a film produced from a polymeric      composition of 80 wt % polypropylene and 20 wt % ethylene-propylene block      copolymer. When this film was extracted in toluene at 90.degree. C., a      film was obtained that was uniformly white and opaque with a porosity of      17 to 20%. Extracted film formed from compositions with other modifiers      had poor appearance with very little whiteness and opaqueness indicating a      low level of porosity. </PAR><PAR>  For film formed from a composition of polypropylene and ethylene-propylene      block copolymer, the immersion of the film in hot toluene did not extract      the ethylene-propylene block copolymer along with the beta-spherulites as      indicated by the extraction level and film appearance being consistent      with the beta-spherulite content of the film. For compositions containing      triblock copolymer with polystyrene endblock, the toluene treatment      appeared to remove the modifiers without imparting porosity to the film. </PAR><PAR>  All films formed from compositions of polypropylene and a second polymeric      component had lower modulus and tensile strengths compared with film      formed from polypropylene. Film prepared from polypropylene and      ethylene-propylene copolymer had the highest modulus and the film was very      uniform and homogeneous with good strength and ductility in both the      machine direction (MD) and cross-machine direction (CD) or transverse      direction (TD). Tensile property data obtained on extracted film produced      from a composition of polypropylene and ethylene-propylene block copolymer      and from polypropylene homopolymer indicated that break elongations in      both the MD and TD direction were up to fivefold greater for the      composition film than for the polypropylene film. The composition film      also showed an improvement of about 20 wt % in tensile strength and had a      smaller reduction in modulus compared to the polypropylene film. </PAR><PAR>  Samples of extracted film prepared from polypropylene homopolymer and      compositions of polypropylene with ethylene-propylene copolymer were      stretched on a T. M. Long Stretcher at stretch ratios of 2:1 and 2.5:1 and      at temperatures ranging from 110.degree. to 127.degree. C. and measured      for MVTR and porosity. Both the composition and homopolymer films exhibit      similar MVTR behavior when compared at similar stretch ratios. As the      stretching temperature is lowered both types of films exhibit an increase      in MVTR. If the orientation temperature was too low, however, the film had      a greater tendency to tear. Extracted films of homopolymer polypropylene      have been successfully stretched at a temperature as low as 115.6.degree.      C., whereas the composition film was successfully drawn at a temperature      as low as 110.degree. C. For films formed from the composition slightly      lower porosities were achieved under a given set of conditions for the      composition film, however even with the lower porosity, no deficiency in      MVTR was observed for the composition film. Tensile properties for      biaxially stretched composition and homopolymer film indicate that the      composition film has almost twice the tensile strength and more than      double the break elongation of the homopolymer films. The composition film      had a softer hand or feel relative to the homopolymer film. </PAR><PAR>  Films were formed from nucleated compositions prepared containing 50, 75      and 100 wt % of ethylene-propylene block copolymer. These nucleated      copolymer films had excellent drape and hand due to the reduced modulus.      However, when these nucleated copolymer films were extracted in hot      toluene, the films became thinner, but did not become microporous. </PAR><PAR>  For the facile process for preparing oriented polymeric microporous films      from compositions of this invention which does not require a      beta-spherulite extraction step, the polymeric composition comprises about      30 to about 95 parts by weight of the ethylene-propylene block copolymer      having an ethylene content of about 10 to about 50 wt %, about 5 to about      40 parts by weight of polypropylene homopolymer or random copolymer having      up to 10 wt % of a comonomer of ethylene or an .alpha.-olefin of 4 to 8      carbon atoms, and low molecular weight polypropylene homopolymer having a      melt viscosity of about 50 to about 1,000 poise measured at a shear rate      of 136 sec.sup.-1 and 190.degree. C. such that the low molecular weight      polypropylene is present in the polymeric composition in an amount from      about 1 to about 10 parts by weight when the polymeric composition      additionally comprises a beta-spherulite nucleating agent and about 5 to      about 30 parts by weight of a calcium carbonate, and from about 5 to about      20 parts by weight when the polymeric composition additionally comprises a      beta-spherulite nucleating agent but is substantially free of calcium      carbonate or when the polymeric composition is substantially free of      calcium carbonate and the nucleating agent. </PAR><PAR>  The beta-spherulite nucleating agent can be present as the red quinacridone      dye, Q-dye, at about 0.1 to about 50 ppm by weight and calcium carbonate      can be present at about 5 to about 30 parts by weight, based on 100 parts      by weight of the ethylene-propylene block copolymer and polypropylene      homopolymer or random copolymer of propylene. Particularly preferred      polymeric compositions for forming oriented microporous films with a MVTR      of 500 g/m.sup.2 /24 hr or greater comprise about 45 to about 75 parts by      weight of the ethylene-propylene block copolymer and about 20 to about 35      parts by weight of the polypropylene homopolymer. Films formed by the      nonextraction technique from polymeric compositions having less than 30 or      more than 95 parts by weight of ethylene-propylene block copolymer do not      exhibit sufficient porosity and breathability. </PAR><PAR>  In general, the low molecular weight polypropylene component is present in      polymeric compositions used to make microporous film by the nonextractive      technique and is absent in film prepared by the process using the      beta-spherulite extraction technique. For polymeric compositions      comprising ethylene-propylene block copolymer, polypropylene, low      molecular weight polypropylene with or without beta-spherulite nucleating      agent, the low molecular weight polypropylene is preferably present in the      composition at about 5 to about 20 parts by weight. For polymeric      compositions comprising, in addition to the three polymeric components,      the beta-spherulite nucleating agent and an inorganic filler such as      calcium carbonate, the low molecular weight polypropylene is preferably      present in the compositions at about 1 to about 10 parts by weight. For      polymeric compositions in which the low molecular weight compositions are      outside the preferred ranges, the resulting oriented porous films are      generally less facile to form and have lower breathability and strength      properties. </PAR><PAR>  Incorporation of a low molecular weight polyolefin such as polypropylene      homopolymer having a melt viscosity of about 50 to about 1,000 poise      measured at 136 sec.sup.-1 and 190.degree. C. into compositions of      ethylene-propylene block copolymer and polypropylene homopolymer or      copolymer of propylene significantly increases the breathability of      microporous films made from these compositions by stretching and without      an extraction step. Film made from compositions containing greater than 20      parts by weight of the low molecular weight polyolefin have a greater      tendency to tear during stretching. For one preferred embodiment of this      invention in which the compositions capable of being formed into      microporous films additionally comprise a beta-spherulite nucleating      agent, the low molecular weight polyolefin can range from 5 to about 20      parts by weight. Upon stretching, films formed from compositions having      beta-spherulites exhibit increased breathability due to increased      formation of interconnecting pores between the microporous cells. For      another preferred embodiment of this invention in which the polymeric      compositions comprise about 5 to about 30 parts by weight of CaCO.sub.3 as      well as a beta-spherulite nucleating agent, it has been found that the      amount of the low molecular weight polypropylene can range from about 1 to      about 10 parts by weight. The addition of the low level of CaCO.sub.3      contributes to the formation of interconnecting pores between the      microvoid cells upon stretching the film. </PAR><PAR>  Scanning election microscope micrographs of the surface of uniaxially      oriented films prepared from a composition of 50 wt % ethylene-propylene      block copolymer having a content of 40 wt % ethylene, 35 wt %      polypropylene and 15 wt % of low molecular weight polypropylene indicate      that numerous elongated voids are visible which range in size from 2 to 15      microns along their major axis and 0.5 to 4 microns along their minor      axis. Many of the voids appeared to contain round inclusions which had      been partially pulled away from the edges of the voids and were attached      to the surrounding polymer by very fine fibrils. The pull-away of the      inclusions is believed to represent an adhesive fabric of the      ethylene-rich dispersed domain of the the ethylene-propylene block      copolymer that has phase separated from the matrix polymer. </PAR><PAR>  Cast films made from compositions of ethylene-propylene block copolymer,      polypropylene homopolymer and the beta-spherulite nucleating agent      stretched uniaxially or biaxially were shown to have a high degree of      microvoiding leading to films which were porous but which had low      breathability as measured by MVTR. The low breathability is believed to      have been the result of many of the microvoids being of the closed-cell      type and the microvoids did not form an interconnected network through      which vapor can pass. Addition of a low molecular weight polyolefin in the      form of a low molecular weight polypropylene (LMWPP) leads to a      significant increase in the MVTR. The increase in MVTR is believed to be      the result of interconnecting pores or channels being formed between the      microvoids from the microscopic failure of the drawn polymer brought about      by a reduction in the breaking elongation of the polymer matrix by the      presence of the LMWPP. </PAR><PAR>  General aspects of the film-forming processes used in this invention, e.g.,      pressing, calendering, or extruding of milled polymer/inorganic salt      mixtures, are well known in the art. Heating of the milled mixture is      conventionally involved in these film-forming methods. The particles of      the inorganic salt can be added in increments during the milling step.      Casting, e.g., of solutions of polymer filled with pore-nucleating      particles, is not preferred. </PAR><PAR>  The facile process for preparing oriented polymeric microporous films from      compositions of this invention which does not require an extraction step      and wherein the films have microvoid cells and interconnecting pores      between the cells comprises the steps of: </PAR><PAR>  (1) forming a film from a polymeric composition comprising about 40 to      about 90 parts by weight of an ethylene-propylene block copolymer having      an ethylene content of about 10 to about 50 wt %, </PAR><PAR>  about 5 to about 40 parts by weight of a propylene homopolymer or random      copolymer having up to about 10 wt % of a comonomer of ethylene or an      .alpha.-olefin of 4 to 8 carbon atoms, and </PAR><PAR>  a low molecular weight polypropylene having a melt viscosity of about 50 to      about 1,000 poise measured at a shear rate of 136 sec.sup.-1 and      190.degree. C. with the proviso that said low molecular weight      polypropylene is present in said polymeric composition at </PAR><PAR>  (a) about 1 to about 10 parts by weight when the polymeric composition      additionally comprises a beta-spherulite nucleating agent and about 5 to      about 30 parts by weight of a calcium carbonate, and </PAR><PAR>  (b) from about 5 to about 20 parts by weight when the polymeric composition      additionally comprises a beta-spherulite nucleating agent but is      substantially free of calcium carbonate or when the polymeric composition      is substantially free of calcium carbonate and the nucleating agent, </PAR><PAR>  (2) heating the film at a temperature of about 35.degree. to about      135.degree. C., and </PAR><PAR>  (3) stretching the heated film in at least one direction at a stretch ratio      of about 1.5 to about 10. </PAR><PAR>  In step (1) of the process a film is formed from the polymeric composition      by any suitable process known in the art for forming films from polymeric      compositions and, in particular, polyolefin-based compositions. Among      these are processes including melt-forming processes such as slot-die      extrusion and blown-bubble extrusion, with the slot-die extrusion process      preferred for ease of operation. In either the blown-bubble or the      slot-die extrusion process the polymer composition is formed into a melt      by a melt-forming means such as a single-screw or a twin-screw extruder.      The polymeric composition together with optional additives or modifiers      can be supplied in pellet or powder form to the extruder or the various      composition components can be supplied directly to the melt-forming means      for a combination of compounding and melting. Typically, temperatures in      the extruders range from about 200.degree. to about 280.degree. C. and, in      particular, for polyolefin-based compositions from about 220.degree. to      about 250.degree. C. The residence time of the polymeric compositions in      the extruders can vary with the size of the equipment and desired      throughput but should be sufficiently long to achieve mixing and melting      while at the same time avoiding degradation of polymer. In the      blown-bubble extrusion process, the film is preferably cooled with a      stream of air. In the slot-die extrusion process, the cooling can be      accomplished with liquid in a cooling bath, such as water, a chill roll or      a stream of air with chill rolls typically used. For film formed from      polyolefin-based compositions with one or more chill rolls, the rolls      typically have temperatures of about 80.degree. to about 120.degree. C. </PAR><PAR>  Small amounts, usually less than about 5 parts by weight based on the total      weight of the polymeric components of the composition, of other materials      used in processing polymeric compositions such as lubricants,      plasticizers, processing plasticizers, surfactants, water, and the like,      may optionally be present. Yet other materials introduced for particular      purposes may optionally be present in the polymeric compositions in small      amounts, usually less than about 15 parts by weight based on the total      weight of the polymeric components of the composition. Examples of such      materials include antioxidants, antimicrobial agents, ultraviolet light      absorbers, flame retardants, dyes, pigments, and the like. The addition of      these materials can take place as the compositions are being prepared or      during when the compositions are being formed into microporous film, and      the addition can be made by any suitable means such as metering pumps,      extruders, and the like. </PAR><PAR>  A particularly useful additive in the polymeric compositions of this      invention is an antimicrobial agent. As used herein antimicrobial agents      include both fungicidal and antibacterial agents and are materials for      deodorizing or inhibiting bacterial, fungal or microbial growth in      synthetic textile articles such as surgical gowns and masks, and      institutional textile products. Inhibiting fungal growth serves to protect      the fabric itself, while the inhibition of bacterial growth prevents odor      caused by the bacterial breakdown of organic matter. Antimicrobial agents,      disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,343,853  which can be added to the polymeric      compositions of this invention include nitrophenylacetate,      phenylhydrazine, polybrominated salicylanilides such as      5,4'-dibromosalicylanilide and 3,5,4'-tribromosalicylanilide,      chlorhexidine, domiphen bromide, cetylpyridinium chloride, benzethonium      chloride, 2,2'-thiobis(4,6-dichloro)phenol,      2,2'-methylenebis-(3,4,6-trichloro)phenol and      2,4,4'-trichloro-2'-hydroxydiphenyl ether. </PAR><PAR>  A particularly preferred antimicrobial agent comprises      2,4,4'-trichloro-2'-hydroxydiphenyl ether which provides suitable      antimicrobial effect when present in polymeric compositions at      concentrations of about 100 to about 2,000 ppm, by weight of the polymeric      components of the composition. At concentration levels below 100 ppm in      the polymeric composition, the antimicrobial effect generally is      insufficient after the composition has been processed into a microporous      film. Preferably, about 200 to about 750 ppm of      2,4,4'-trichloro-2'-hydroxydiphenyl ether by weight of the polymeric      components of the microporous film, are present to ensure retention of the      microbial effect after processing. A specific example of such an      antimicrobial agent is that designated as Microban.RTM. Plastic Additive B      from Clinitex Corporation of Huntersville, N.C. </PAR><PAR>  The antimicrobial agent can be incorporated into the microporous film      prepared from the polymeric compositions by combining the agent with the      composition prior to or during extrusion of the film so that the agent is      substantially uniformly dispersed in the composition in the molten state.      Preferably, a concentrate or masterbatch of about 5 to about 15 wt %      antimicrobial agent in the propylene homopolymer component of the      polymeric composition is employed to simplify handling of the agent and to      improve dispersion of the agent in the polymeric composition and      microporous film prepared therefrom. </PAR><PAR>  The film provided in step (1) can be obtained directly from the film      forming operation or it can be wound on a take-up roll and provided to      step (2) from these take-up rolls. Steps (2) and (3) include heating and      stretching steps, respectively, by which the provided film is rendered      microporous. The film is heated by any suitable heating means for a time      and at a temperature such that the film attains the desired temperature in      as short a time as possible while retaining properties of the film.      Typically, heating rolls are used to heat the film to the desired      orientation temperature. For films stretched simultaneously in both      directions the desired temperature ranges from about 40.degree. to about      95.degree. C. For films formed from polypropylene-based compositions, the      films are preferably heated from about 70.degree. to about 85.degree. C.      The desired temperature ranges for films which are stretched in the      machine direction and subsequently stretched in the transverse direction      are different for the two operations. The desired temperature for      orientation in the machine direction can range from about 40.degree. to      about 95.degree. C., with a preferred temperature range of about      60.degree. to about 70.degree. C. for films formed from polyolefin-based      compositions. In the subsequent transverse direction orientation, the      desired temperature can range from about 75.degree. to about 140.degree.      C., with a preferred temperature range of about 105.degree. to about      120.degree. C. for polyolefin-based compositions. Attempts to orient films      at temperatures outside the preferred temperature ranges typically do not      produce films with the desired porosity and strength properties. </PAR><PAR>  In addition to the type of orientation, the composition of the film also      influences the orientation temperature. For films comprising      ethylene-propylene block copolymer, polypropylene homopolymer or random      copolymer or propylene and low molecular weight polyolefin the films are      preferably heated to a temperature of about 50.degree. to about 80.degree.      C. For films comprising ethylene-propylene block copolymer, propylene      homopolymer or random copolymer, low molecular weight polyolefin, a      beta-spherulite nucleating agent and/or an inorganic filler such as      calcium carbonate the films are preferably heated to a temperature in the      range of about 35.degree. to about 135.degree. C. </PAR><PAR>  In step (3) the heated film can be stretched uniaxially or biaxially.      Uniaxial stretching can be performed using rolls with a roll or tenter for      restraining the film. Biaxial stretching can include successive uniaxial      stretching steps comprising longitudinal stretching by rolls and      transverse stretching by a tenter, simultaneous biaxial stretching using a      tenter and the like. For biaxial stretching, the stretch ratio in the      longitudinal or machine direction and transverse direction may be the same      or different. Generally, the stretch ratios are the same in both      directions. The stretch ratio for either uniaxial or biaxial orientation      can be about 1.5 to about 10. The preferred method of biaxial stretching      includes the formation of a film by extruding a film with a small amount      of MD orientation usually less than 25% of the total MD orientation. The      formed film is further oriented in the MD followed by orientation in the      TD such that the ratio of the final MD to TD orientation draw ratio is      about 0.8 to 1.2. The preferred stretch ratio for biaxial stretching is      about 1.5 to about 5 and for uniaxial stretching about 1.5 to about 6. </PAR><PAR>  The oriented polymeric microporous films formed from the polymeric      compositions of this invention can be made within a wide range of film      thickness or caliper. For the uses contemplated for these films, a      thickness of more than 0.005 mm and less than about 2 mm is generally      preferred. Films having a thickness in the range of about 0.01 to about 1      mm are particularly useful. A measurable decrease in caliper or thickness      normally occurs after the stretching step. For uniaxial orientation, this      decrease can be as much as one-third of the thickness of the unoriented      film. For biaxial and uniaxial orientations with very high stretch ratios,      the decrease in thickness can be even greater. Preferably, the thickness      of oriented films produced by this invention ranges from about 0.005 to      about 1.0 mm in thickness. The unstretched films from which the oriented      films are formed range from about 0.01 to about 2.0 mm. </PAR><PAR>  In one embodiment of the process for forming an oriented microporous      polymeric film from the polymeric compositions of this invention, wherein      the film has a thickness of about 0.005 to about 0.2 mm and a MVTR      determined according to ASTM E-96, procedure E, of about 1,500 g/m.sup.2      /24 hr or greater, the process comprises the steps of: </PAR><PAR>  (a) forming a film having a thickness of at least 0.1 mm and at least 20 wt      % beta-spherulites from a polymeric composition comprising, per 100 parts      by weight of the composition, about 40 to about 90 parts by weight of an      ethylene-propylene block copolymer having an ethylene content of about 30      to about 45 wt %, about 5 to about 40 parts by weight of a polypropylene      having a MFR of about 1.0 to 30 dg/min as determined according to ASTM      D1238, about 5 to about 20 parts by weight of a low molecular weight      polypropylene having a melt viscosity of about 50 to about 1,000 poise      measured at a shear rate of 136 sec.sup.-1 and a temperature of      190.degree. C., and about 0.1 to about 10 ppm of a red quinacridone dye on      a cast film line with an extruder having a polymer melt temperature of      about 200.degree. to about 240.degree.

C. from a polymeric composition      comprising per 100 parts by weight of the composition, about 40 to about      90 parts by weight of an ethylene-propylene block copolymer having an      ethylene content of about 30 to about 45 wt %, about 5 to about 40 parts      by weight of a polypropylene having a melt flow rate of about 1.0 to 30      dg/min as determined according to ASTM D 1238, about 1 to about 10 parts      by weight of a low molecular weight polypropylene having a melt viscosity      of about 70 to about 500 poise measured at a shear rate of 136 sec.sup.-1      and 190.degree. C., about 5 to about 30 parts by weight of calcium      carbonate having an average particle size in the range of 0.1 to 10      microns, and about 0.1 to about 10 ppm of a red quinacridone dye having      the structural formula:      ##STR2## </PAR><PAR>  (b) heating the film to a temperature in the range of about 35.degree. to      about 135.degree. C., and </PAR><PAR>  (c) stretching the heated film biaxially with a stretch ratio in the      machine direction of about 1.5 to about 4 and a stretch ratio in the      transverse direction of about 1.5 to about 4. </PAR><PAR>  The oriented microporous film made from the polymeric compositions of this      invention can be incorporated as one or more layers into composite      structures with supporting materials such as a polymeric foam material, a      woven fabric or a nonwoven fabric such as a carded web of staple fibers, a      spunbond fabric, a meltblown fabric, a self-bonded nonwoven web such as      RFX.RTM. fabric and cross-laminated fibrillated film fabrics such as CLAF      fabric. The layers can be adhered to each other or laminated together by      conventional methods such as adhesive bonding, thermobonding, or other      techniques which do not significantly decrease the vapor permeable and      liquid impermeable properties of the porous film. For example the      microporous films can be adhered to CLAF fabric made of polypropylene by      thermobonding and to CLAF fabric made of polyethylene by adhesive bonding. </PAR><PAR>  Films made from the polymeric compositions of this invention may be      employed in a wide variety of applications where their microporous      structures are useful including the apparel, membrane and ultrafiltration      areas. Among the applications contemplated are filters, separators in      electrochemical cells, reverse osmosis membranes, house wrap, covers for      equipment such as automobiles, motor bikes, stationary equipment and the      like, breathable bandages and other vapor permeable first aid dressings,      surgical drapes and protective garments for use in hospitals and in      electronic clean rooms or other areas where chemical spills may be a      problem, conformable and printable backings for coated and laminated      articles, typewriter and other inking ribbons, sheets or pads, breathable      garments, or clothing materials of footwear such as leather substitutes or      rainwear, battery separators, breathable shoe inserts or insole material,      flexible gas-permeable containers such as sterilizable packages for      surgical instruments and the like. </PAR><PAR>  Stretched porous film containing starch can be used in disposable      applications such as diapers and agricultural mulch film. Mulch film can      also have about 5 to about 15 wt % cornstarch incorporated into it. For      agricultural mulch film, the starch-containing porous film can be      impregnated with pesticides and/or fertilizers which are released over the      growing season. The starch-containing mulch film upon exposure to the sun      during the growing season degrades sufficiently so that the film can be      plowed under at the end of the growing season without costly removal and      disposal. The films should also prove useful in the application of making      pressure sensitive labels wherein the oriented polypropylene microporous      films offer the advantage of improved drying characteristics and      printability of the labels and lower water absorbency compared to paper      when water-based adhesives are used and improved adhesive curing is      obtained from the moisture release through the porosity of the microporous      film. </PAR><PAR>  Description of test procedures used to determine properties reported for      the examples of this invention and comparative examples are as follows: </PAR><PAR>  Melt Flow Rate--Melt flow rates of polyolefin resin samples were measured      according to ASTM D1238-70. </PAR><PAR>  Tensile Strength and Elongation--Test specimens of 2.54 cm wide samples of      the films were used to determine tensile strength and elongation according      to ASTM D-1682. The tensile strength was measured in the machine direction      and in the transverse direction and is reported in units of pounds or      grams. </PAR><PAR>  Basis Weight--The basis weight of films was determined by weighing a      one-foot square representative sample of the film on a digital balance to      .andplus;-.0.01  g. This weight was used to calculate the basis weight of the      film in units of oz/yd.sup.2 or g/m.sup.2. </PAR><PAR>  Moisture Vapor Transmission Rate--The moisture vapor transmission rate      (MVTR) was determined according to ASTM E-96 Procedure E in units of      g/m.sup.2 /24 hr. </PAR><PAR>  Porosity--The porosity of films was calculated from the density of a      one-foot square sample of film determined by weighing the sample to      .andplus;-.0.01 g and measuring the film thickness to calculate a density and      calculating the porosity of the film by the equation: </PAR><EQU>  Pandequals;(1-(D.sub.f /D.sub.i)).times.100 </EQU><PAL>  wherein D.sub.f is the final density calculated from the film sample weight      and thickness, D.sub.i is the initial density of the film which for      polypropylene-based film a value of 0.905 g/cc was used and for      polypropylene-based film containing 14 wt % calcium carbonate a value of      1.0 g/cc was used. </PAL><PAR>  The following examples further elaborate the present invention although it      will be understood that these examples are for purposes of illustration      and are not intended to limit the scope of the invention. </PAR><PAC>  EXAMPLE 1 </PAC><PAR>  A composition of ethylene-propylene block copolymer, Hifax RA-061 from      Himont, containing 40 wt % ethylene and nucleated polypropylene      homopolymer pellets containing 1.5 ppm of the Q-dye beta-spherulite      nucleant was prepared in a 19 mm Brabender extruder having a single stage      mixing screw. The homopolymer polypropylene from Amoco Chemical Company      had a MFR of 3.2 dg/min determined according to ASTM D1238.

C. The line speed of the cast film      was adjusted to give the desired residence time in the toluene bath and      after the film exited the tank it was sent through a series of rollers      maintained at temperatures of 90.degree. to 135.degree. C. on which the      film was dried. The solvent-swollen film shrunk back to its original      dimensions during the drying process and became white/opaque in appearance      due to light scattering from the numerous created voids. The extracted      film was stretched biaxially on a T.M. Long stretcher at stretch ratios of      2:1 to 2.5:1 and temperatures ranging from 110.degree. to 127.degree.

The beta-spherulite content of      the cast film, as measured by the K value, generally increases as the      nucleant concentration increases from 1 to 4 ppm. For polypropylene      homopolymer, Tc is typically about 117.4.degree. C. and K values depending      on casting conditions of the film are typically in the range of 0.3 to      0.6. </PAR><PAR>  From the thermal data presented in Table III, it can be seen that some      modifiers appear to adversely affect the efficency of beta-spherulite      nucleation. This effect was particularly evident for Modifier-B in      Comparative Example C and for Modifier-D in Comparative Example E in which      the value of the Tc was depressed. The cast films made from these blends      also had the lowest K values. The highest K value of 0.28 was for Example      1 as given in Table I. When film from this blend was extracted in toluene      of 90.degree. C., a good quality, uniform white and opaque porous film was      obtained having a porosity of 17 to 20%. Extracted films of Comparative      Examples D, F and G had poor appearance with very little whiteness      indicating a low level of porosity. </PAR><PAR>  For Example 1 it was apparent that immersion of the cast film in hot      toluene did not extract the ethylene-propylene copolymer along with the      beta-spherulites because the extracted film had an extraction level and      film appearance consistent with the beta-spherulite content of the film.      However, for Comparative Examples A and B with concentrations of 50 and 75      wt % ethylene-propylene block copolymer, the hot toluene treatment      appeared to remove the ethylene-propylene block copolymer without      imparting porosity to the films. Film made from the compositions of      Comparative Examples A and B when immersed in hot toluene swelled much      more than polypropylene homopolymer film and took longer to dry. A      detailed microscopic examination of these films before extraction      suggested that the ethylene-rich phase was dispersed throughout the film      and was also present within the beta-spherulites. The ethylene-rich phase      was not extracted and its presence as a solvent swollen polymer within the      newly-created pores of the film may have caused these pores to close up      during the drying process. Good quality porous films were not obtained      from the films of Comparative Examples A and B. </PAR><PAR>  Polymeric compositions of ethylene-propylene block copolymer (Modifier-A),      a nominal 3 MFR polypropylene homopolymer resin and 1.65 ppm of Q-dye      beta-spherulite nucleant were prepared with 20 wt % Modifier-A (Example      1f), 25 wt % Modifier-A (Example 1g) and 30 wt % Modifier-A (Example 1h).      These compositions were pelletized on a 44.5 mm Prodex extruder, and then      cast into film using a 38 mm Davis Standard extruder. The extruder was      fitted with a 30.5 cm wide slit die, and the cast film produced was 26.7      cm wide and 4 mils thick. The chill roll temperature was in the range of      104.4.degree. to 110.degree. C., and the extruder screw speed was in the      range of 15-30 rpm. Films made under various processing conditions were      characterized by x-ray for K values. Samples of the film were also      extracted by constraining them in an embroidery hoop and immersing the      hoop in a toluene bath at 90.5.degree. C. for 44 minutes. The weight loss      after extraction and the MVTR of the extracted film were measured. The      data for films made from blends of polypropylene and 20  wt %, 25 wt % and      30 wt % ethylene-propylene block copolymer are summarized in Table IV. </PAR><TBL>                TABLE IV                                                         ______________________________________                                         Ex-   Extruder Chill Roll                                                                               K     Wt %    MVTR                                    ample RPM      Temp, .degree.C.

The MVTR generally increased with screw rpm and/or chill roll temperature      for both the 20 wt % and 25 wt % blends, but not for the 30 wt % blend.      The 30 wt % copolymer blend films generally had much lower MVTR values      than that of the 20 wt % and 25 wt % blends in spite of the fact that the      30 wt % copolymer films had relatively high levels of extracted material. </PAR><PAR>  This effect may be explained in that at copolymer levels about 30 wt %, the      film becomes weakened by exposure to hot solvent and removal of greater      amounts of polymer, and this weakness causes more of the pores and voids      created by the extraction process to collapse when the film dries.      Additional support for this explanation comes from the fact that the 30 wt      % copolymer films showed a greater degree of sagging and swelling just      after they were removed from the solvent, relative to the lower      copolymer-containing films. Also, after being dried, the films containing      30 wt % copolymer were not as opaque and white as the 20 wt % and 25 wt %      copolymer films, each having a higher MVTR. This lack of opacity is      indicative of a lower concentration of microvoids. </PAR><PAR>  These results suggest that in order to obtain oriented extracted films with      high breathability from nucleated blends containing ethylene-propylene      block copolymer, the concentration of the ethylene-propylene block      copolymer used should be no greater than 30 wt % or 30 parts by weight      based on the weight of polypropylene and block copolymer. </PAR><PAC>  EXAMPLES 2-4 AND COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE H </PAC><PAR>  Films of Examples 2-4 and Comparative Example H were prepared from      compositions containing ethylene-propylene block copolymer containing 40      wt % ethylene with a melt flow rate of 1.0 dg/min (Himont, Hifax RA-061),      polypropylene homopolymer having a MFR of 3.0 dg/min (Amoco Chemical Co.,      6300 P) and/or low molecular weight polypropylene (Polyvisions Inc.,      Proflow-1000) having a melt viscosity of 137 poise measured at a shear      rate of 136 sec.sup.-1 and 190.degree. C. </PAR><PAC>  EXAMPLE 2 </PAC><PAR>  The oriented microporous film of Example 2 was prepared from a composition      of 75 wt % of the ethylene-propylene block copolymer, 15 wt % of the      polypropylene and 10 wt % of low molecular weight polypropylene. The      composition was melt compounded using a 19 mm Brabender extruder at a      polymer melt temperature of 205.degree. C. and an extruder screw speed of      90 rpm and cast into a film using a 19 mm Brabender extruder with a      15.25-cm wide slit film die with polymer melt temperatures of 215.degree.      to 222.degree. C., extruder screw speed of 50 rpm and chill roll      temperatures of 89.degree. to 92.degree. C. The film was uniaxially      stretched on an Instron Tensile Tester at room temperature using a 3:1      draw ratio. A modified test for measuring MVTR was used wherein the center      portion of the stretched film was cut out, and because the center-portion      sample was too small to be tested for MVTR using the standard 7.62 cm      diameter test specimen, the center-portion sample was mounted on a 7.62 cm      diameter foil mask and a 2.54 cm diameter sample test area was tested      using standard desiccant cups. In order to compare the MVTR data from the      modified test procedure with the MVTR data obtained on conventional-sized      samples, several oriented porous film samples covering a wide range of      MVTR values and using both conventional-sized, 7.62 cm diameter samples      and foil-masked, 2.54 cm diameter samples were tested and a correlation      equation was determined. The experimental MVTR data was approximately      linear on a log-log plot over two decades of MVTR measurements and a      least-squares regression analysis for films having MVTR values greater      than 200 g/m.sup.2 /24 hr yielded the following equation: </PAR><EQU>  log(MVTR of 7.62-cm disk)andequals;0.3535andplus;0.8519.times.(log (MVTR of 2.54-cm disk)) </EQU><PAL>  The MVTR determined by the modified MVTR test for a microporous film of      Example 2 oriented 1 hr after casting was 8,420 g/m.sup.2 /24 hr. For a      film of Example 2 oriented at the same orientation conditions after being      aged for several weeks, a MVTR value of 4,850 g/m.sup.2 /24 hr was      determined by the modified test procedure. </PAL><PAC>  EXAMPLE 3 </PAC><PAR>  The microporous film of Example 3 was prepared using the composition and      processing conditions of Example 2 with the exception that the cast film      was stretched biaxially on a T.

The casting      and orientating conditions were the same as in Example 2. The MVTR      measured by the modified MVTR procedure was 3,310 g/m.sup.2 /24 hr. </PAR><PAC>  COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE H </PAC><PAR>  The oriented film of Comparative Example H was prepared from a composition      of 75 wt % of the ethylene-propylene block copolymer and 25 wt % of      polypropylene.

The composition was compounded with a 63.5 mm Prodex extruder and      cast into a film from a 61 cm wide die having a die lip gap of 10 mils      onto a heated chill roll with a surface temperature of 110.degree. C. The      cast film thickness was about 4.5 to 5 mils, and the extruder speed was      set at 48 to 50 rpm, which corresponded to an output rate of about 25      kg/hr. The cast film line speed was about 0.125 m/s, and the MD      orientation draw ratio was 2:1. The film width at the MD inlet and outlet      was 50.8 cm and 48.3 cm, respectively. The MD stretching was done at      60.degree.  C. with the annealing section was set at 71.degree. C. The TD      stretching on a Tenter Frame was done at draw ratios of 2:1 to 3:1 and      temperatures of 105.degree. to 120.degree. C. The highest temperature      experienced by the film was in the last zone, the annealing zone, of the      Tenter Frame oven. In this last zone the track separation was brought in      by 10 to 15 cm in order to allow some relaxation of the film. The film      line speed in the TD section was 0.75 m/s.

All of the compositions contained 2 ppm      of red quinacridone dye as a beta-spherulite nucleating agent. </PAR><PAC>  EXAMPLE 17 </PAC><PAR>  The oriented film of Example 17 was prepared from a composition of 50 wt %      of the ethylene-propylene block copolymer, 35 wt % of the PP/CaCO.sub.3      masterbatch, 3 wt % of low molecular weight polypropylene having a melt      viscosity of 346 poise measured at 136 sec.sup.-1 and a temperature of      190.degree. C., and 12 wt % of the polypropylene homopolymer. The      composition was compounded with a 63.5 mm Prodex extruder, pelletized and      cast into film from a 63.5 mm Prodex extruder having a 61 cm wide die      having a die lip gap of 10 mils onto a heated chill roll with a surface      temperature of 110.degree. C. The cast film thickness was about 4.5 to 5      mils, and the extruder rpm was typically set at 48 to 50 for an output      rate of about 25 kg/hr. The cast film line speed was 0.125 m/s and the MD      orientation stretch ratio was 2:1. The film width at the MD inlet and      outlet was 50.8 cm and 48.3 cm, respectively. The MD orientation was made      at a temperature of 60.degree. C. and the annealing section was set at      71.degree. C. with some of the MD oriented film edge-trimmed before      windup. Most of the TD orientation was at draw ratios of 2:1 to 3:1, and      temperatures of 105.degree. to 120.degree. C. The highest temperature that      the film experienced was in the last or annealing zone of the Tenter Frame      oven wherein the track separation was reduced by 10 to 15 cm in order to      allow some relaxation of the film. The film line speed in the TD      orientation section was 0.75 m/s. </PAR><PAR>  Examples 18-30 and Comparative Example N were prepared by the processing      conditions described in Example 17. </PAR><PAC>  EXAMPLE 18 </PAC><PAR>  The film of Example 18 was prepared from a composition of 50 wt % of the      ethylene-propylene block copolymer, 47 wt % of the PP/CaCO.sub.3      masterbatch for a CaCO.sub.3 concentration of 18.8 wt %, and 3 wt % of low      molecular weight polypropylene having a melt viscosity of 74 poise at 136      sec.sup.-1 and 190.degree.

However, the MVTR is substantially increased in the Examples where as      little as 3 wt % of the LMWPP is present. As the concentration of the      LMWPP is increased in the composition, the breaking elongation of the      resulting microporous film decreases. At a given concentration of LMWPP,      using a higher melt viscosity LMWPP results in higher breaking elongation,      and higher levels of CaCO.sub.3 result in substantially higher MVTR      values. </PAR><PAR>  Compositions of the oriented film, film casting conditions of screw RPM and      line speed in feet per minute (fpm), machine direction stretch ratio, film      thickness as cast and after being stretched in the MD, transverse      direction film speed and stretch ratio are tabulated for the oriented film      of Examples 17-30 and Comparative Example M in Table XI. </PAR><PAR>  The MVTR values obtained on these films after being biaxially stretched      ranged from about 3,321 to 6,029 g/m.sup.2 /24 hr.
