 The rightnetwork, with capacity for current needs and the capability to expand, isessential.andP;  Without a workable wide area network, communication  amonggeographically dispersed locations is slow, efforts are duplicated, andbusiness is impaired.andM;Wawa Food Markets--a convenience store chain based in Wawa, Pa.andP;  --learnedquickly about the problems of an inadequate WAN.andP;  With more than 450convenience stores throughout Connecticut, New Jersey, Delaware, Pennsulvaniaand Maryland, and new stores being added all the time, Wawa had outgrown itsoriginal network almost overnight.andM;The old Wawa communications network had been burdened by chain-storeapplications such as electronic mail, point-of-sale data entry, inventory andcash settlement.andP;  The company's network was strained by &quot;data overload,&quot;according to the network manager.andP;  Add to this the cost of tracking troublemodems, the cost of idel backup lines and the cost of excessive downtime, andthe old network was turning into a budget buster.andP;  It was clear, the managersaid, that Wawa was being pushed into building a more flexible wide areanetwork.andM;Data traffic &quot;was getting out of hand,&quot; explained Mike Dowler, Wawa's systemsand network manager.andP;  &quot;It was unmanageable the way it was.&quot;andM;About three years ago, right after Wawa had moved from an IBM 4341 mainframeto a DEC networking environment, four regional computer sites (one centralsite and three remote sites) each serviced about 100 stores and formed thehub of the company's network.andM;MOVING INTO THE BIG TIMEandM;According to Dowler, more than 220 DECnet point-to-point channels providedthe links between the stores in the chain and the four main computer sites.andO;Eleven multiplexers were used within the network.andM;At the regional computer sites, calls were separated into local and corporatedata, with corporate data forwarded to the central computer site forprocessing.andP;  The central site used removable disks and tapes both fordisaster recovery and software transferral to remote sites.andM;Although the original WAN design looked good on paper, Wawa's growthpresented a number of significant problems.andM;First, data recovery and backups at three of the four unmanned remote siteswere difficult.andP;  There was no operator to load tapes, so the system wasbacked up over phone lines--costing thousands each month for leased lines.andM;The old WAN also did not have sufficient capacity to handle the periods ofhighest demand for the company.andP;  On Monday mornings, for example, payrolloperations would typically overload Wawa's old network.andM;In a report to Wawa management, Dowler warned that adding point-to-sale dataentry appications increased the load on the network beyond capacity inevening hours, when the systems were being backed up over the links.andM;Wawa officials last spring settled on a network redesign proposal from itsmultiplexer supplier, Infotron.andP;  In redesigning their network, Wawa officialsdecided to change the distribution of processing.andM;The VAX 8520s and associated hardware in three of the four remote computersites were brought to the central site and joined in a VAXcluster.andP;  Thisreduced the cost of the centers and the leased-line backup costs.andM;And what a difference it has made, Dowler said.andP;  Wawa's cash registers(intelligent terminals similar to PCs, made by Sasi of Bensalem, Pa.) nowautomatically dial into one of the company's remote sites to transferinventory, cash intrasactions and payroll data.andP;  Each store's terminal &quot;wakesitself up in the middle of the night [to send its data for the day] and[then] goes back to sleep,&quot; Dowler quipped.andM;A comprehensive network management package that Wawa purchased from Infotronaloows Wawa to monitor and control activities on the network, Dowler said.andO;Using the Network Manager package, systems people now can track networkusers, network traffic patterns and broken equipment.andM;&quot;Modems that were bad before never got fixed&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;[Now] we're moreaware of how often we max our modems out.&quot;andM;The fourth remote site was found to be a good backup site, and was joinedwith the central site over a high-speed line connected to the Ethernetbridge.andM;New Multiplexers--Infotron 892s--also were installed to allow complete use ofall lines, including the once idle backup lines.andP;  Wawa paid about $120,000for the multiplexers.andM;Total cost for revamping the network--including equipment, installation, DECsoftware licenses, moving expenses, cabling and all other associatedcosts--was approximately $268,200, according to Dowler.andP;  Maintenance and a56Kbps leased line run about $1,141 per month.andM;Hard savings came in several forms and totaled $264,000.andP;  The first benefitwas that the WAN installation delayed the purchase of three planned 8250 or8350 VAX upgrades.andM;It recovered for other uses the old duplicate system disks, and eliminatedthe need for additional tape backup untis.andP;  Additional node licenses werealso unnecessary.andM;The soft savings came in many areas, including proactive network managementthat has resulted in increased uptime and full use of all communicationlines.andM;END OF DARK AGESandM;Meanwhile, a wide area network has completely changed the way a large Midwestplastics container manufacturer does business.andP;  Ball, with headquarters inMunice, Ind., installed its VAX-based WAN six years ago.andM;Prior to that, Ball employees were in the technological dark ages, performingadministrative tasks using typewriters, calculators and the U.S.andP;  postalservice.andM;But today that has all changed, said Ron Valdez, manager of VAX consultingfor Ball's Package Products Group (PPG), based in Westminster, Colo.andM;A manufacturer of metal and plastic containers, Ball's package product grouphas networked its ninemanufacturing plants from coast to coast with its mainVAXcluster at its Colorado office.andP;  The PPG group currently runs one VAX11/785, one VAX 8600 and two VAX 8650s.andM;In addition, a VAX 11/750 runs in each of six plants with a VAX 8250 in aseventh.andP;  The two other plants are connected to a VAX 11/785 installed in theMuncie office.andP;  The division has a mix of approximately 100 DEC terminals.andM;At the Colorado office, around 200 users do technical and supportapplications, as well as research and development.andM;Atht eplant sites, about 300 users work with administrative applications,electronic mail, data entry, word processing, inventory tracking andelectronic spreadsheets.andM;According to site data compiled by Computer Intelligence, the PPG networkemploys T1 and T3 lines for voice and data transmission, with long-distanceexpenditures as of May running at about $15,000 a month.andM;When the project began, company officials didn't need to be convinced that awide area network was necessary, Valdez explained.andP;  They spoke with fivevendors--DEC, IBM, Hewlett-Packard, of Palo Alto, Calif.; Control Data, ofMinneapolis; and Prime Computer, of Natick, Mass.--and told them  they wanteda solution that could support a WAN, he said.andP;  Cost wasn't a major factor;vendor capability was key, Valdez said.andM;&quot;Only two vendors fit the bill--HP and DEC,&quot; Valdez said.andP;  &quot;And DEC waspicked because of the number of software packages that it could run underVMS.&quot;andM;Administrative employees now make good use of the network's mailcapabilities.andM;Another significant network benefit is its training application.andP;  &quot;We havereduced the cost of travel,&quot; Valdez said.andP;  For example, he noted thatpersonnel at the Williamsburg, Ba., plant can now be trained by personnel inColorado by telephone and terminal.andP;  Employees rarely have to travel totraining sessions anymore.andM;Troubleshooting also has become a lot easier, Valdez said, noting that thenetwork has an error-logging utility that can pinpoint a malfunction in anyof the systems--whether it's a disk, peripheral, or other type of  error.andM;When it comes right down to it, the network application possibilities areendless, Valdez said.andM;&quot;There are a thousand things we're doing and we haven't even scratched thesurface yet.andP;  We're just beginning.&quot;andM;Moving on to the West Coast, First Interstate Bank of California, withheadquarters in Los Angeles, claims to have lower phone bills after switchingto a tymnet dial-up network with 9600bps modems.andP;  The company had dropped itsuse of voice-grade ATandamp;T lines because of reliability problems.andM;According to Richard Siegel, First Interstate's systems administrator, aboutfive or six employees in each of some 30 First Interstate bank branches aredialing into the Tymnet public data switched network service to makeconnections into the VAXes at the company's headquarters.andP;  Tymnet is aservice of Tymnet, McDonnell douglas Network Systems, of San Jose, Calif.andM;Users who call over Tymnet are connected either to the VAX 8700, which runsVMS, or a MicroVAX 3600, which runs Ultrix, at First Interstate's office inLos Angeles.andP;  Tymnet offers bank users 9600 bps for data transfer, siegelsaid.andM;&quot;The connections tend to be more reliable than calling the central computersdirectly [over voice-grade ATandamp;T lines],&quot; he added, especially for theirHawaii affiliate.andM;First Interstate has been using Tymnet for about three years, Siegel said.andO;Users generally use the dial-up service for file transfers.andP;  Using Kermitsoftware, employees in First Interstate's branches transfer information suchas the monthly branch bank balance sheets to headquarters.andM;There is one disadvantage to using Tymnet, Siegel noted--speed.andP;  Sometimesresponse time during peak hours is so slow that it can take half a secondbefore a character is echoed back to the screen, he said.andP;  During theseslowdowns, user frustration increase and productivity falls.andM;Overall, however, the bank's experience with the network has been good,Siegel said.andP;  &quot;We don't get many complaints from users,&quot; he said.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
