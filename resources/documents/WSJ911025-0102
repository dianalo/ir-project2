Burke at the Chicago City Council onOct. 3:                                                                                                       </LP><TEXT>   Since reaching its peak of 3.6 million in 1950, Chicago'spopulation has declined. According to the 1990 federalcensus, the city now has the same number of residents, about2.7 million, as it had in 1920. However the city's budget in1920 was about $816 million in today's dollars -- less thanone-third of the 1990 budget of $3 billion. Or, to put itanother way, city government spent about $302 per person in1920, compared with $1,100 in 1990. . . . It is unlikely thatthis increased spending has resulted in a tripling of thequality of city services for the average Chicagoan.</TEXT></DOC>
