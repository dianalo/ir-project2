(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Motorola CodexandM;CODEX 3260andM;The Codex 3260 is designed to appeal to the buyer who wants to install 30 or40 modems that will be used heavily every day.andP;  Enclosed in a sleek case,this rugged device can stand up to the rigors of most office environments.andM;Hidden behind the hinged front panel is an LCD that can show the currentstatus of the modem during a communications session and provide access to anextensive options-menuing system.andP;  By selecting items through the menu,virtually any of the features of the 3260 can be set or checked.andM;Also notable is the 3260's power-supply design.andP;  With the unit placed insidethe modem's case, there is no bulky external unit to deal with.andM;The only problem encountered with the 3260 is that in its default state ithas the &quot;carrier detect&quot; signal on, making most communications software thinkit is already on-line.andP;  This is easily reconfigured, however.andM;The performance of the 3260 was generally on par with the other modems inthis review.andP;  Though not reflected in the benchmarks, due to the way thescores are averaged, the 3260 would have had a minor edge in the ZIP filetest had it not been for a poor result on the first pass of a previouslycompressed file.andP;  While the 3260 took longer to turn off its compressionfacilities than did the other modems in this review, it came in with the bestthroughput in that test after it had adjusted its compression properly.andM;Among the file-compression and error-correction options available for the3260 are MNP and V.42/V.42bis.andM;The documentation included with the 3260 is a large, wire-bound manual thatexplains all of the modem's features in great detail.andP;  It is well-written andwell-illustrated.andM;Versions of the 3260 are available for more than 30 countries and can bealtered to meet any post, telegraph and telecommunications office'srequirements.andM;Among the options available but not tested for the 3260 is the 9110 NetworkManagement System (NMS) feature for supporting modem pools.andP;  Two smallconnectors on the back of the 3260 let users serially link multiple 3260s.andO;An AT-class machine running the NMS software and attached to the modem's NMSconnectors can be used to interrogate and configure any of the modemsattached to the chain.andP;  This process can be performed while the modems arecommunicating with remote systems and has no impact on their performance.andM;The 9110 NMS option includes the software and the initial cable that runsfrom the PC to the first modem.andP;  It is priced at an additional $2,000.andP;  Anetwork management version of the external Codex 3260 is priced at $1,395.andM;------------------&quot;VITAL SIGNS&quot; DATAandM;Motorola CodexandM;(subsidiary of Motorola Inc.)andM;Mansfield, Mass.andM;(800) 446-6336 or (508) 261-4000andM;Privately heldandM;Year established: 1962andM;Number of employees: 3,800andM;Gross annual revenue:andM;not disclosedandM;Gross annual earnings:andM;not disclosedandM;Source.andP;  Information supplied by company.andM;</TEXT></DOC>
