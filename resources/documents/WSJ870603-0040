And the U.S. has radically different definitions of fair trade for Americans and foreigners. As Fred Smith of the Competitive Enterprise Institute says, &quot;If the same anti-dumping laws applied to U.S. companies, every after-Christmas sale in the country would be banned.&quot;    U.S. trade laws require that the Commerce Department first determine whether a foreign product is being sold in the U.S. at less than fair value, or if the foreign company receives a government subsidy. After that, the International Trade Commission must determine whether imports cause domestic companies any &quot;harm which is not inconsequential, immaterial, or unimportant.&quot;    But this measure is so broad as to be meaningless. ITC Chairwoman Susan Liebeler notes, &quot;Any time a foreign producer exports products to the U.S., the increase in supply must result in a lower price of the product than would otherwise prevail.&quot; Even if imports only prevent U.S. prices from rising, they can be condemned for a price-suppressing effect. Our trade laws have never been accused of a pro-consumer bias.    What is &quot;less than fair value&quot;? The Commerce Department's creative interpretation probably has made many medieval scholastics smile in heaven.    For instance, last year, it cited China for a dumping margin of 66.65% on its porcelain-on-steel cookware (meaning that it was spending about $1.67 to get $1 in U.S. sales). Since China does not have a market price system, the department looked elsewhere to deduce the cost of Chinese cookware production, deciding that Thailand was &quot;at a level of economic development comparable&quot; to China. (This must be a surprise to Bangkok, since Thailand's per-capita income is roughly three times higher than China's.) But Thai cookware makers refused to open their files to the Commerce Department -- justifiably, since at least one foreign company that voluntarily helped it in the past has subsequently been hit with &quot;dumping&quot; charges itself. (Similarly, often when huge dumping margins are announced it is because the foreign company refused to reveal all its in-house financial secrets to a Commerce Department inquisition.)    The Commerce Department then decided to judge China by comparing its cookware prices with Dutch, French and West German cookware prices. Not surprisingly, Chinese prices were much lower. (Chinese quality was also lower, but the department did not adjust for that.) The Commerce Department thus &quot;proved&quot; that China was unfairly dumping its pots and pans on America. Because of the verdict, the Customs Service now demands a 66.65% cash deposit on all incoming Chinese porcelain-on-steel cookware.    Trade laws are premised on the idea that every foreign company is trying to monopolize every sector of the American economy. The International Trade Commission, established in 1916, determines if harm was done by a particular country's imports to a particular U.S. industry.    Even though Israel's share of the U.S. oil-drilling-equipment market was less than 1%, for example, the International Trade Commission found that the American industry had somehow suffered. In a recent flower investigation, the ITC concluded that full-size Kenyan carnations were hurting American flower growers. Total Kenyan carnation exports to the U.S. are Lilliputian -- less than 0.05% of total U.S. flower consumption -- and the alleged &quot;less than fair value&quot; margin was only 1.58%. (Susan Liebeler and Vice Chairwoman Anne Brunsdale dissented but were outvoted. All five ITC commissioners are Reagan appointees.)    And there is a double standard. Former ITC Chairman William Leonard noted in a recent interview: &quot;The ITC more or less takes on faith the price information and profitability supplied by domestic industries. But the price information is usually meaningless because it does not show the quantities being sold.&quot; Of course, U.S. producers have an incentive to overstate their prices to make it easier to prove that foreigners are unfairly &quot;underselling&quot; them. No American company has ever been penalized for lying about its prices in an ITC investigation.    Reading the congressional debate on the House trade bill, one would think that most trade cases were about international conspiracies to take over the U.S. market. But the vast majority of recent trade cases are simply American bureaucrats quibbling about such things as which expenses of a foreign company to allow, how to calculate foreign cost of production, adjustments for exchange-rate fluctuations, comparing prices for arbitrary &quot;adjustments&quot; for differences in quality, different volumes of sales, and wholesale vs. retail sales figures.    In 1984, Italy was convicted of a &quot;less-than-fair-value&quot; margin of 1.16% on its pads for the keys of woodwind instruments -- even though Commerce admitted that it did not compare sales of identical products in Italy and the U.S. The whole idea of proclaiming 1% and 2% dumping margins in a world where exchange rates routinely fluctuate 2% a week is absurd.    Commerce Department analyses of foreigners' cost of production are often senseless. U.S. trade law requires that the department always assume in its &quot;cost-of-production&quot; formula that a foreign company makes a profit of 8% or more. Every trade case that proves that foreign companies are selling below cost of production also assumes that foreign companies make an 8% profit. Nobody at the department can explain how a company can sell below cost and still make this same profit.    The recent semiconductor case, where the Commerce Department claimed that the Japanese were selling at less than &quot;fair value,&quot; was typical of the department's wizardry. It assumed a static &quot;cost-of-production&quot; model that was scorned by the Federal Trade Commission as unrepresentative of how businesses operate and calculate in the real world. There were disputes on how to allocate such items as plant overhead, research and development expenses, start-up costs and pension costs. And, of course, the Commerce Department assumed that the Japanese were making an 8% profit on their money-losing sales.    The whole point of U.S. trade laws is to prevent foreigners from dumping their products, bankrupting American companies, and then taking over the market and clobbering consumers. Our trade laws perpetually inflate domestic prices in order to protect consumers against the one-in-a-million possibility that a foreign company could corner the market -- and raise prices. But the more internationalized markets have become, the less ability individual companies or countries have to dominate a market. If Germans try to bushwhack beer-drinkers, for example, the Dutch, Belgians and even the Mexicans will undercut their scheme.    According to Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige, &quot;Our fair trade laws are the bedrock on which free trade stands.&quot; But, rather than bedrock, our trade laws are a rigged trap, certain to snare foreigners while leaving domestic companies untouched. For the U.S. Commerce Department, the only fair price seems to be a price higher than that charged by American competitors.    ---   Mr. Bovard writes frequently on trade issues. </TEXT></DOC>
