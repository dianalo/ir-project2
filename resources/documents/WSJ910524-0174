The action was a victory for the major oil companies,which have made opening the refuge their top legislativepriority. But it may be a short-lived one. Intenseenvironmental opposition has thwarted past efforts to allowdrilling in the refuge. In addition, the measure is attachedto a bill that many lawmakers contend is too heavily weightedtoward production rather than conservation.</LP><TEXT>   The overall measure was approved 17-3. Among its otherprovisions, the bill would streamline nuclear plantlicensing, overhaul electric utility regulation and partlyderegulate oil-and-gas pipelines.   The American Petroleum Institute said in a statement thatopening the refuge &quot;holds the promise of billions of barrelsof oil, tens of thousands of jobs, significant revenues forthe government and billions of dollars in increased economicactivity. . . .&quot; Energy Secretary James Watkins called thepackage a &quot;very fine bill.&quot;   On an 11-8 vote, opponents of drilling in the refugefailed to overturn the provision. Under the legislation, oilexploration would be allowed on the coastal plain of therefuge along the Beaufort Sea, about 1.5 million acres of the19 million-acre expanse.   It is unclear how much oil is under the coastal plain; thelatest Interior Department estimates say there is a 46%chance that at least 3.57 billion barrels of oil could beextracted. Environmentalists argue that regardless of theamount of oil extracted, it would be insignificant comparedwith the nation's total oil consumption and that it isn'tworth the potential damage to the pristine wilderness.   &quot;This bill is the environmental destruction act of 1991,&quot;said Daniel Becker, director of energy programs for theSierra Club.   The future of the energy measure is unclear. It facesconsiderable opposition from environmental and conservationinterests on the Senate floor, where lawmakers generallyaren't as favorably disposed to industry as the EnergyCommittee. Committee Chairman Bennett Johnston (D., La.) saidhe hopes it can be brought to the full Senate next month, butno date has been set.   Specifically, many lawmakers contend that the measure isunbalanced because the lawmakers failed to include aprovision that would require auto makers to increase modestlythe fuel efficiency of their cars. Yesterday, the paneldefeated such a provision for a second time. Instead, themeasure would direct the Transportation Department to set newfuel-economy standards for cars and light trucks after takinginto account such criteria as technological feasibility.   In the House, committees have begun holding hearings onsimilar legislation.   Main provisions of the Senate Committee's bill would:   -- Speed up licensing procedures for new nuclear plants byestablishing a combined licensing process coveringconstruction and operation. Critics contend this would reducethe opportunities for public involvement in licensingdecisions.   -- Revamp electric utility regulation in an effort toaccelerate the entry of non-utility companies into the powergenerating business and increase competition. Utilities andnon-utility companies would be allowed to build, own andoperate power plants in more than one state without beingsubject to the restrictions -- including oversight by theSecurities and Exchange Commission -- that apply to utilitiesunder the Public Utility Holding Company Act.   -- Expedite the approval process for oil-and-natural gaspipelines.   -- Require car and truck fleets in cities of 250,000 ormore to begin operating on non-gasoline fuels. Therequirement generally would apply to fleets of 20 or morevehicles.</TEXT></DOC>
