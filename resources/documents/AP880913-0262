Analysts said the announcement of the new ``bus,'' or datapathway, killed for good the lingering idea that IBM would controlthe standards for the next generation of personal computers.   ``It's IBM and the rest of us,'' said William Krause, chairmanand chief executive of 3Com Corp., which makes communicationssoftware for machines made by both IBM and its rivals.   In an unusually busy day for the computer industry, there werethese other important developments:   _The New York Times reported that IBM would link up with aformer nemesis, Steven P. Jobs, the co-founder of Apple ComputerInc. It said IBM will spend $10 million for a license to usetechnology developed by Jobs' new company, Next Inc.   _IBM announced a way for its most advanced personal computers torun the huge library of programs written for its System 36minicomputers. It also introduced three improved models of its 9370minicomputers and two fast but inexpensive members of its PersonalSystem-2 family.   _Digital Equipment Corp. opened its annual DEC World show inCannes, France, by unveiling plans to expand its business ofhelping companies plan and manage their computer and communicationssystems. At the same time, it announced a way to monitor and managean entire far-flung computer network from a single point.   _Computer Associates International Inc. of Garden City, N.Y.,the world's largest independent software company, announcedagreement on a $170 million purchase of Applied Research Inc. ofPrinceton, N.J., from Ameritech, the Chicago-based telephoneholding company.   The nine companies that gathered for a New York news conferencehave agreed on standards for a bus, which specifies the wayinformation is passed between the processor, keyboard, screen,memory and other components.   The capabilities of the new bus, which had been kept secret,exceeded the expectations of many industry watchers. The companiessaid it will outperform IBM's Micro Channel in several respects,including the speed at which it can handle bursts of data.   Tuesday's announcement was important because it helped setstandards that will last into the 1990s, when advanced personalcomputers will be as fast as today's fastest mainframe computers.   ``This is a great day for the industry,'' said Mark D. Stahlman,an analyst for Sanford C. Bernstein andamp; Co. ``IBM's Micro Channel isnow just one of a number of alternatives.''   It appears that there will be three main competitors in comingyears: the Micro Channel inside advanced models of IBM's PersonalSystem-2; the NuBus inside advanced models of Apple Computer Inc.'sMacintosh, and the bus announced Tuesday, EISA, for ExtendedIndustry Standard Architecture.   Although Houston's Compaq Computer Corp. is believed to havebeen a main instigator of the project, it played down its role.   ``It just gained momentum. I don't think you can single out anyone or even a few companies,'' said Ron Canion, president and chiefexecutive of Compaq, which soared into the Fortune 500 in recordtime by successfully challenging IBM in personal computers.   Computers built on the new bus will not be available until thesecond half of 1989. That gives IBM time to convince customers thatif they want a more powerful bus, they should buy an IBM PersonalSystem-2, which is already on the market.   ``My question is, if you're going to buy a machine today,wouldn't you want to buy a machine that has those advancedcapabilities today?'' said Bill Lyons, IBM's vice president forsoftware marketing.   For buyers of personal computers, the differences between thePersonal System-2 and the competitors' machines will be hard todetect, especially within the next few years.   Canion estimated that 98 percent of programs developed for onekind of computer would run on the others without modification. Themain exception would be communications software.   The nine companies agreed to share any patents on the new busamong themselves and offer free licenses to any other companiesthat want to use it. The only charge to companies will be $2,500 tocover paperwork and lawyers' fees.   The other eight originators of the standard are Tandy Corp.,Zenith Data Systems, AST Research Inc.,Wyse Technology,Hewlett-Packard Co., Italy's Ing. C. Olivetti andamp; Co. SpA, andJapan's NEC Information Systems Inc. and Epson America Inc.   Other major contributors to the project are Intel Corp. andMicrosoft Corp., which are also major suppliers to IBM, of chipsand software, respectively.   Ben Rosen, the venture capitalist and chairman of Compaq, saidthe coalition of so many rivals was unprecedented: ``It's one ofthe major events in the history of the PC industry,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
