Spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley said Mithileshwar Singh, who is apermanent resident of the United States, was in Syrian hands inBeirut and would be taken to Damascus early Tuesday morning.   Syrian officials later said that Singh arrived in Damascus earlyTuesday and would spend the night in a government rest house beforebeing turned over to U.S. officials.   ``We join with Mr. Singh's relatives in rejoicing in his releaseand call for the urgent, unconditional release of all hostages inLebanon,'' Mrs. Oakley said.   The spokeswoman said she did not how he was freed or hiscondition.   Mrs. Oakley said Syria notified the U.S. embassy in Beirut andSecretary of State George P. Shultz, who is at the United Nationsin New York, of Singh's release.   ``He'll be transported tomorrow to Damascus, and at that pointwe will consult with him whether he wants to take advantage of thefacilities at Wiesbaden,'' she said.   The United States maintains a hospital at the military base inWest Germany.   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said there would be nocomment from the White House until Singh had been turned over toAmerican authorities by Syria on Tuesday.   The release had been expected at 2 p.m. EDT, and then at 3 p.m.After two more hours of anxious waiting, Mrs. Oakley made theannouncement in the State Department newsroom at 5 p.m.   Singh was released at 10:05 p.m. local time, 3:05 p.m. EDT,across the street from the Beirut headquarters of the U.N. Reliefand Works Agency, which aids Palestinian refugees, said a policespokesman in Beirut who spoke on condition of anonymity.   ``We can confirm,'' Mrs. Oakley said, ``that the Syriangovernment has told us they have custody of a hostage, an Indiancitizen and legal permanent resident of the United States.''   She then identified the freed hostage as Singh, a visitingprofessor at Beirut University College. ``We understood the Syriansintend to transport Mr. Singh to Damascus on Tuesday morning,''Mrs. Oakley said.   Asked if there were indications other hostages would bereleased, the spokeswoman said: ``No. This is all we have.''   Singh's wife, Lalmoney, is in Beirut, and Singh, 60, will beturned over the U.S. ambassador to Syria, Edward Djerejian, Mrs.Oakley said.   Although Singh is an Indian citizen, he is a permanent residentof the United States and ``was associated'' with the Americans whotaught at the college, she said.   The release came after kidnappers holding Singh and threeAmerican teachers said they would free one of their captives at thewest Beirut headquarters of the U.N. Relief and Works Agency forPalestinian refugees.   The announcement that a hostage would be freed from IslamicJihad for the Liberation of Palestine came in a 36-word handwrittenstatement in Arabic delivered to a western news agency in Beirut.   President Reagan created a stir in New York a week ago when hesuggested that something was in the works regarding the Americansheld hostage by various pro-Iranian elements in Lebanon.   He said at the time that he could not say anything furtherbecause ``you don't talk while a no-hitter is being pitched.''   Fitzwater said later that the president had no specialinformation and was merely saying he didn't want to cast bad luckon the situation.   Earlier Monday, Fitzwater disclosed that a third-partygovernment had told the United States that there might be a hostagereleased.   Neither Reagan nor Fitzwater would speculate on possible motivesbehind such a hostage release, although both steadfastly deniedthat the U.S. government had been negotiating to win the liberationof the Americans.   During a picture-taking session in the Oval Office with visitingJamaican Prime Minister Edward Seaga, Reagan said no release wouldtake place ``on the basis of negotiations of any kind. We have donenothing of that kind.''   The three educators believed still held by Islamic Jihad, allcaptured Jan. 24, 1987, are:   Alann Steen, a journalism professor at Beirut UniversityCollege; Jesse Turner, a visiting professor at the school, andRobert Pohill, an assistant business professor.   Nearly four months after they were taken captive, Turner said ina videotape released by Islamic Jihad that Steen was suffering fromhigh blood pressure, was in ``pitiful'' health and was expected todie at any moment despite being under a doctor's care.   Hezbollah, or Party of God, is believed to be the umbrella groupfor kidnappers holding most of the 17 foreign hostages in Lebanon.   Besides the three kidnapped with Singh in January 1987, thesesix Americans are also held hostage in Lebanon:   _Terry Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent of TheAssociated Press, kidnapped March 16, 1985. Islamic Jihad claimedresponsibility.   _Thomas Sutherland, the dean of agriculture at the AmericanUniversity in Beirut. He was taken prisoner June 9, 1985; IslamicJihad claimed responsibility.   _Joseph James Cicippio, acting comptroller of the university,kidnapped Sept. 12, 1986. The Revolutionary Justice Organizationsaid it took Cicippio prisoner.   _Frank Herbert Reed, director of the private LebanonInternational School, taken hostage Sept. 9, 1986. The pro-LibyanArab Revolutionary Cells-Omar Moukhtar Forces took responsibility.   _Edward Austin Tracy, an author of children's books. He wasseized on Oct. 21, 1986. The Revolutionary Justice Organizationsaid he was its prisoner.   _Marine Lt. Col. William R. Higgins, head of a 75-man observergroup attached to the U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon, was kidnappedFeb. 17, 1988. The pro-Iranian Organization of the Oppressed onEarth, believed to be a Hezbollah-affiliated group, claimedHiggins' abduction.</TEXT></DOC>
