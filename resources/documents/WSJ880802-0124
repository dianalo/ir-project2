Hughes (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><IN> MKT </IN><DATELINE> LOS ANGELES  </DATELINE><TEXT>   The photo is a stunner: In an eight-page fold-out magazine ad, a brunet bombshell in a white bathing suit and silver spike heels stands, chest thrust forward, next to a bright red sports car. Above them, the copy reads: &quot;Automobile by Ferrari. Body by Forshan.&quot;    Body by Forshan? The woman is an android, maybe? A robot?    Neither. Forshan, readers learn, is Vincent R. Forshan, a Rancho Mirage, Calif., cosmetic surgeon. Never mind that he hadn't laid a scalpel on the bombshell. &quot;It didn't say 'this body by Forshan,'&quot; explains the doctor.    Plastic surgery is booming, with up to three million Americans a year, by one estimate, now getting their noses shrunk, breasts enlarged, eyelids trimmed, thighs vacuumed and tummies tucked. That is three times as many as just five years ago, and plenty of money is involved, what with an ordinary nose job costing around $4,000. But the number of doctors doing these renovations has grown apace. And in major centers of narcissism like Southern California, the competition to find candidates for face lifts is cutthroat.    So some doctors have resorted to hiring publicity agents, marketing advisers and ad agencies. The results, ranging from graphic videos to ugly before-and-after ads, sometimes look like a photo exhibit by Diane Arbus, the great American photographer of the bizarre. &quot;The advertising runs the gamut from reasonable to obscene, fraudulent and extremely bad taste,&quot; says John Renner, a physician on the board of the National Council Against Health Fraud.    It may be body-sculpting's soft underbelly. The California attorney general's office has begun investigating whether the ads are truthful and whether doctors give patients enough information about the risks. &quot;Cosmetic surgery has become a big business, and it has attracted disreputable people who see it as a means of making money without offering quality,&quot; says Harvey Zarem, a former chief of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery at the UCLA School of Medicine.    Much of the hype comes from a new breed of practitioner: the specialist in dermatology, gynecology or some other field who has begun doing cosmetic surgery in the office to cash in on a trend. While any physician is allowed to do the operations, the American Board of Plastic Surgery says many of the new practitioners don't have adequate training. It also objects to self-appointed groups springing up with official-sounding names.    As for ads, a prominent group of plastic surgeons is trying to get the Federal Trade Commission to frame advertising guidelines. Los Angeles magazine, meanwhile, has just banned before-and-after cosmetic-surgery ads. &quot;The biggest objection is that they are grotesque,&quot; says Nan Caddel, production manager.    One of plastic surgeons' newest gimmicks is the videotape designed to humanize the guy with the knife. A tape that Maurice P. Sherman of Vista, Calif., sends to people who respond to his ads opens with reassuring shots of the doctor in sweatpants playing basketball with a boys' club. Next, one sees his family on vacation in the wilderness. But then come his patients, and they don't look like Darryl Hannah. Demonstrating on a middle-aged woman, Dr. Sherman notes the &quot;turkey gobbler neck&quot; caused by a &quot;big wad of excessive fat.&quot;    Another video, for a group of surgeons, softens the viewer up with one-liners. It features Phyllis Diller, in a green wig, offering such Hippocratic wisdom as, &quot;Don't ever go to a doctor who operates in a Ford van.&quot; Turning serious, the video brings on a pretty teen-age girl, who says she hopes to get implants to enhance her cheek bones as a high-school graduation present. A woman explains that she wants &quot;smile surgery,&quot; so her gums won't show when she grins.    Most unnerving are the before-and-after print ads. &quot;The category has mushroomed like a Frankenstein monster,&quot; says account executive Tony Ransdell of Los Angeles magazine, choosing his simile with care. Next to layouts of glamorous fashion models in slick magazines are ads featuring grainy photos of women with multiple chins, steamer-trunk eye bags or waists that would shame a walrus.    &quot;I get enough sleep . . . but I look so tired!&quot; cries an ad for David R. Fett of Los Angeles, showing four pairs of eyes stacked up like a totem pole of before-and-after shots. All eight look as if they could use a nap.    Ads for breast implants sometimes make the procedure look like something fun to do on lunch break. One from Gary Manchester in San Diego shows a flat-chested young woman from the neck down in a sagging bathing suit. &quot;After 27 years,&quot; it says. In the &quot;after&quot; photo on the right, the bathing-suit top is no longer the least bit loose. &quot;After 1 hour, 18 minutes,&quot; boasts the ad. Dr. Manchester disclaims any deception, saying that was how long the operation took, though the &quot;after&quot; picture wasn't made till a few days later.    Dr. Sherman, the basketball-playing star of his own video, uses another tack: a magazine ad, featuring a blond model in a pink bathing suit leaning against a tree. The ad asks, &quot;Can 'natural' beauty be created through cosmetic surgery?&quot; It seems a curious question, given that Dr. Sherman didn't operate on the beauty.    &quot;What we wanted to do was present an image of beauty, not to {imply} that this is what they are going to look like,&quot; explains the doctor. He adds that the model's breasts were enlarged, but not by him.    All this is a sensitive topic among some practitioners. Before granting an interview, Dr. Forshan, of the bombshell-and-Ferrari ad, asks, &quot;It's not going to say I'm a dirt-bag?&quot;    Dr. Forshan spent $80,000 to produce and run his ad in Los Angeles magazine earlier this year. It wasn't just pretty pictures. The ad helped patients make up their minds by giving them extensive details about his office decor and personal life.    He sees nothing odd about this approach to medicine. &quot;Let's be honest. What are cosmetic surgeons? We are superstars. If I were a family practitioner, who would {care} about Vince Forshan? Nobody!&quot;    Yet there are hazards in such bold approaches. In April, Stephen Grifka, a Culver City, Calif., surgeon, announced through his hospital that he had been appointed the &quot;official facial plastic surgery consultant&quot; for the Miss San Diego beauty contest, a preliminary to the Miss America Pageant. Distributed to the press was a photo of a beaming Dr. Grifka next to Miss San Diego.    That didn't sit right with Pageant officials, who prefer an image of corn-fed goodness. Miss San Diego was upset too, they add, because she hadn't had cosmetic surgery and wasn't aware she was posing for a publicity shot. The local contest ended its tie to Dr. Grifka.    That didn't stop him. Soon afterward, he said he had been named to the executive committee of the Los Angeles contest. Not so, contends a spokesman for that contest. Dr. Grifka says he had been named by a man who has since left.    Now the doctor has volunteered for the production committee of the Miss Culver City contest. And while surgical advice won't be part of his official duties, he expects to have ample opportunity to dispense it. Says Dr. Grifka, &quot;People are always pulling me aside and saying, 'Hey, what do you think about my eyelids?'&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
