Qaribur Rehman Saeed, director of the rebel-controlled AfghanNews Agency, said the PLO chief ``is not the person to mediate. Hehas been supporting the Kabul government for 10 years.''   Saeed said none of the seven rebel parties, based in Pakistan,supports Arafat's plan, which calls for a cease-fire and talksbetween the U.S.-backed Moslem guerrillas and President Najib'sgovernment. The talks would be followed by elections.   ``The mujahedeen don't want to talk to Najib, and they don't likeArafat,'' said Saeed. Afghan guerrillas call themselves mujahedeenor Islamic holy warriors.   Arafat is reportedly going to the Afghan capital on Thursday tospeak with Najib.   The guerrillas have been fighting to oust Afghanistan'spro-Soviet government for 11 years. The Soviet army fought alongsideAfghan troops for nine years but pulled the last of its soldiers outof the country in February in accordance with a U.N.-mediated accord.   The guerrillas have refused to deal with Najib.   The Afghan government said Sunday that rebels are mobilizingfighters around Kabul and may be planning an assault on the Afghancapital. The military was placed on maximum alert in and around thecity.   ``We are watching the situation very closely. We will wait untilthe last moment. If they try to mount a military assault, we willgive them a befitting reply,'' said Lt. Gen. Abdul Haq Olumi, thetop military man in the ruling People's Democratic Party ofAfghanistan.   Olumi refused to give details of the reported mobilization. ``Wewill tell you after we win the battle,'' said the 49-year-oldgeneral.   ``We do not want bloodshed,'' Olumi said. ``We want to fight forpeace now.'' But he said soldiers would ``fight to their last bloodand sweat'' to defeat the guerrillas.   Olumi also claimed that 15,000 guerrillas had been killed infighting since the Soviet Union withdrawal was completed. It was thefirst time since February the government released rebel casualtyfigures.</TEXT></DOC>
