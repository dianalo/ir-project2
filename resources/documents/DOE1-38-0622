DAKASEP is a filled, non-woven separatorwhich is flexible and heat sealable. Through modification of formulationand processing variables, products with a variety of properties can beproduced. Variations of DAKASEP have been tested in Ni-H/sub 2/, Ni-Zn,Ni-Cd, and primary alkaline batteries with good results. Data are presentedhere for separators designed for Zn-HgO primary batteries. Actual performancedata for Zn-HgO E-1 size cells are also included.</TEXT></DOC>
