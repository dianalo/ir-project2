Centers for Disease Control researchers cited a survey in 29states, where prisons reported 31 tuberculosis cases per 100,000inmates in 1984-85, compared with eight cases per 100,000 amongnon-incarcerated adults in those states during the same period.   ``In some large correctional systems, the incidence of TB hasincreased dramatically,'' the CDC said in its report Thursday.   It noted especially high rates in New York, New Jersey andCalifornia.   Tuberculosis, a contagious, bacterial lung disease, infectsabout 22,000 people each year in the United States. Most can becured with drug treatment. Scientists estimate that about 10million Americans are infected with the virus, but the vastmajority will never get the disease.   The spread of AIDS-virus infections during this decade may playa part in the spread of TB in prisons, the Atlanta-based CDC said.AIDS weakens the immune systems of patients, making them moresusceptible to infections which other people might fight off,including tuberculosis.   Tests for acquired immune deficiency syndrome should be offeredto all inmates with known TB infections, the CDC report said.   ``Persons at highest risk ... are close contacts,'' the CDCsaid, noting that TB can pose particular problems in prisons,``where the environment is often conducive to airborne transmissionof infection among inmates, staff and visitors.''   The CDC committee recommends new tests at least once a year,rapid chest X-rays for TB-infected people showing symptoms, andisolation for those with suspected or confirmed symptomatic TBcases.   Isolation should include separate ventilation systems to cutdown the risk of airborne transmission of TB, the committee said.``It may be necessary to move a patient to another facility orhospital with a respiratory isolation facility,'' the panel said.   Prison overcrowding may be a cause for spreading TB, said Dr.Dixie Snider, a CDC tuberculosis specialist.   In New York there were 106 TB cases per 100,000 inmates in 1986_ seven times more than the average of 15 cases reported in 1976-78.   Inmates in New Jersey had a TB rate of 110 per 100,000 in 1987,11 times higher than the general New Jersey population. InCalifornia, the 80 per 100,000 rate was nearly six times higherthan in the general population.</TEXT></DOC>
