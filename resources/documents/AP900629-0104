Gerry Studds, D-Mass., on aWashington street corner June 7.   James L. Byrne and Thomas E. Carter Jr., both 19, confessed tomisdemeanor charges of assault and battery on a congressman. Theytold the federal magistrate they were drunk when they attackedStudds, who they said did not provoke them.   Studds was not seriously injured in the attack but was punchedin the face and knocked to the ground. Assistant U.S. Attorney EricMarcy said witnesses who heard Studds call for help also allegedlysaw the young men kicking Studds. Byrne and Carter denied theallegation.   ``Tom hit him first, then I hit him,'' Byrne told U.S.Magistrate Patrick Attridge. He said Studds was ``walking toward us... I saw that (Carter) had hit him and then I went over and hithim again. He began to call for help and we walked away.''   Carter said that he, Byrne and other friends had been drinkingat a nearby bar prior to the early morning attack in the city'sDupont Circle neighborhood.   ``We were pretty intoxicated,'' he said. ``We were looking forthe car. I guess we were pretty frustrated ... I took the firstswing.''   Attridge asked the defendants whether Studds had done anythingto provoke the attack. ``You just picked him out of the blue?'' themagistrate asked. Both teen-agers replied yes.   Byrne and Carter apologized to Studds in a written statement.Both are high school graduates who work for a microfilm company inMaryland.   Sentencing was scheduled for Sept. 7. Each could face maximumpenalties of a year in jail and a $100,000 fine. But Byrne'sattorney, Michael McCarthy, said because neither defendant had aprior record he believed they would receive sentences of no morethan four months.</TEXT></DOC>
