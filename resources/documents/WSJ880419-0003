Charles E. Exley, Jr., chairman and chief executive officer, said in an interview that he expects the information systems company to report higher profit for 1988, but the rate of gain may not match the 20% of the first quarter.    The company posted a profit of $74.1 million, or 88 cents a share, versus $61.5 million, or 65 cents a share, a year earlier. Per-share earnings growth of 35% topped the rise in dollar profit because NCR has repurchased about 12 million shares in the last 12 months, including 2.5 million in the first quarter. The company had an average 84.3 million shares outstanding in the latest quarter, down from 95.3 million a year earlier.    Revenue was $1.28 billion, up from $1.12 billion in the 1987 first quarter. Equipment sales rose 17%, and service revenues increased 13%. Rentals, a small part of NCR's revenue, declined.    In composite New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday, NCR shares closed at $60.25, unchanged.    Mr. Exley said he was disappointed by the decline in domestic orders for the first quarter, but wasn't disturbed because year-earlier domestic orders were so strong. However, he said the order decline was broadly based, including a number of the company's product lines.    World-wide, NCR's orders rose in the latest quarter, Mr. Exley said, with particular strength in the Pacific group. Japan, which makes up about half of that group, showed good order gains, he added. Orders were particularly strong for bank automation equipment, multiuser and large computer systems, he said.    Net for the period was aided by the decline in the value of the dollar, Mr. Exley said. On the other hand, a 24% rise in spending for research and development was a limiting factor on profit in the latest quarter. He said the company will also have an increase in Randamp;D spending for the full year, but less than 24%. </TEXT></DOC>
