The violence was touched off by the killing of three IrishRepublican Army guerrillas. Police said British troops ambushed thethree on Tuesday as they drove along a country road, armed andwearing ski masks.   Rioting broke out in Roman Catholic areas of Belfast onWednesday night and continued until dawn, police said.   The three injured were taken to a hospital after the clash nearFalls Road, an IRA stronghold in west Belfast. Their condition wasnot immediately known.   Youths set fire to a bus, two vans and more than 35 cars andhurled gasoline bombs and rocks at security forces, while a gunmanfired on the city's New Barnsley police station, police said.   Thursday night, half a dozen cars were stolen in the Falls Roadarea, a police spokesman said on condition of anonymity, but it wasnot on the scale of the previous violence.   Two brothers killed in Tuesday's ambush, Gerard and MartinHarte, will be buried Friday, and the third man, Brian Mullen, willbe buried Saturday. Police said all three were known IRA operatives.   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, in an interview publishedThursday, said the recent increase in IRA attacks ``strengthens theresolve of the British government that Northern Ireland is part ofthe United Kingdom and will remain so.''   The mainly Catholic IRA is fighting to drive Britain frompredominantly Protestant Northern Ireland and unite the provincewith the 95 percent Catholic Irish Republic.   Police said they found a submachine gun, a pistol and ammunitionin an empty west Belfast house, and seized an air pistol andbomb-making equipment in a raid on the Strabane office of SinnFein, the outlawed IRA's legal political wing.   They said a bomb planted by a masked man exploded near a gasstation at Strabane on the Irish border 60 miles west of Belfast.No injuries were reported.   The IRA launched a stepped-up campaign against the British armythis summer, but suffered three blows in quick succession thisweek, starting with Tuesday's ambush, followed Wednesday by abombing blunder that killed two civilians in Londonderry and thearrest of two IRA suspects in West Germany.   Spreading its bombing and shooting campaign to mainland Britainand continental Europe, the IRA has killed 27 British military menthis year, including eight in a bus bombing in the west of theprovince on Aug. 20.   That attack prompted a British pledge to crack down on the IRA.Tuesday's ambush killing, apparently by an elite anti-guerrillasquad, was seen as the start of the counterattack.   ``Blows on three fronts for the IRA,'' headlined The Times ofLondon.   West German authorities Thursday said two alleged IRA memberscaptured near the Dutch border are prime suspects in recentbombings of British military installations in West Germany.   The men were caught Wednesday with a weapon believed to havebeen used in a shootout in the Netherlands that killed a Royal AirForce member in May, they said.   Mrs. Thatcher was quoted as saying the IRA and its supporters``think that if they step up terrorism it will weaken our resolveto stay in the province. Quite the reverse is true. Terrorism willnot win.''   She refused to spell out what new measures against the IRA wereadopted, ``But my message to them is this: Do not doubt our resolveto defeat terrorism.''   The Irish government called for an urgent meeting with Britishofficials and said, ``The frightening escalation of violenceundermines the very maintenance of the rule of law.''   A senior Sinn Fein official, Martin McGuinness, criticizedWednesday's bungled IRA operation, which killed Sean Dalton, 55,and Sheila Lewis, 60, in Londonderry.   Dalton broke into a neighbor's apartment, concerned he had notseen its occupant for several days, and triggered a bomb rigged bythe IRA to blow up an army squad. Mrs. Lewis was standing on abalcony outside.   The IRA apologized and said, ``Although the operation wascarefully planned, it went tragically wrong.''   McGuinness said he was not criticizing the IRA as a whole, ``butI do have a responsibility to criticize individual IRA operationsthat result in civilian deaths. This tragic accident raises anumber of questions which the IRA must answer.''   Eleven IRA members have died violently this year, and 20civilians have been killed in botched IRA operations.</TEXT></DOC>
