Meanwhile in the Andes highland city of Ayacucho, police saidleftist guerrillas slit the throats of two men and shot a woman todeath for their alleged collaboration with government forces.   University of San Marcos officials, students and reporters atthe disturbance said the injuries occurred as dozens of riot policefired tear gas and buckshot to disperse 300 campus protesters. Theprotesters in turn threw rocks at police.   At least 60 demonstrators were taken away by police in paddywagons. Police refused to discuss the confrontation.   A Peruvian photographer for the British news agency Reuters anda cameraman for Viznews, a television news service, received minorinjuries when they were hit with buckshot fired by police, Reuterssaid.   An Associated Press photographer said he saw several police andstudents wounded in a ``hail of rocks and buckshot'' during thesecond straight day of campus disturbances at San Marcos, Peru'slargest university with about 45,000 students. The university isfour miles west of downtown.   San Marcos Rector Jorge Campos said protests increased after theschool announced last week that it might have to close due to alack of operating funds.   Campos said the government, which recently imposed austeritymeasures to combat severe economic woes, has not responded to theschool's request for $5.2 million in funding.   A column of Shining Path rebels late Monday raided Muyurina, afarming village outside Ayacucho, and executed the three during akangaroo trial in the central plaza.   Police said villagers were forced to witness the slayings.   The Shining Path, a Maoist guerrilla group that has waged aninsurgency for eight years, has executed hundreds of highlandpeasants amid similar mock trials to punish suspected governmentcollaborators and scare other peasants from acting against therebellion, officials say.   The impoverished farmland surrounding Ayacucho, 225 milessoutheast of Lima, was the birthplace and remains the stronghold ofthe Shining Path. The fighting has spread throughout the centralAndes, down to the populated coast and into the eastern jungle,claiming at least 12,000 lives.</TEXT></DOC>
