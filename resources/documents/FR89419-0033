Persons interestedin being placed on a mailing list for further NPRMS should also requesta copy of Advisory Circular No. 11-2A which describes the application procedure.<ITAG tagnum="84">The Proposal</ITAG>The FAA is considering an amendment to Subpart G, andSection;71.181, of theFederal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR Part 71) to designate a 700 foot transitionarea at Minden, Nebraska. To enhance airport usage, a new instrument approachprocedure is being developed for the Pioneer Village Field, Minden, Nebraska,utilizing the Kearney VOR as a navigational aid. This navigational aidwill offer new navigational guidance for aircraft utilizing the airport.The establishment of this new instrument approach procedure based on thisnavigational aid would entail the designation of a transition area at Minden,Nebraska, at the above 700-feet above ground level within which aircraftare provided air traffic control service. Transition areas are designedto contain IFR operations in controlled airspace during times of terminaloperation, and while aircraft transit between terminal and enroute environments.The intended effect of this action is to ensure segregation of aircraftusing the approach procedure under instrument flight rules (IFR) from otheraircraft operating under visual flight rules (VFR). This action would alsochange the airport status from VFR to IFR.Section 71.181 of Part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations was republishedin Handbook 7400.6E, January 3, 1989.The FAA has determined that this proposed regulation only involves an establishedbody of technical regulations for which frequent and routine amendmentsare necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) isnot a ``major rule'' under Executive Order 12291; (2) is not a ``significantrule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluationas the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matterthan will only affect air traffic procedures and air navigation, it iscertified that this rule, when promulgated, will not have a significanteconomic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteriaof the Regulatory Flexibility Act.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 14 CFR 71</ITAG>Aviation safety, Transition areas.<ITAG tagnum="84">The Proposed Amendment</ITAG>Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me, the FAA proposesto amend Part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR Part 71) asfollows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 71_DESIGNATION OF FEDERAL AIRWAYS, AREA LOW ROUTES, CONTROLLEDAIRSPACE, AND REPORTING POINTS</ITAG>1.
