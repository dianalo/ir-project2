Better ways arenow available to quantify the consequences of this damage and thereforeplan the best stimulation treatment for the well completion. Laboratorydata, coupled with computer simulation, allows an examination of themore important damage mechanisms and their effect on a well's productivity.Using results from fluid compatibility and regained permeability coreflow tests, it is possible to determine the effect of permeability reductionby fluid invasion, invasion depth, relative permeability changes, andcapillary pressure changes in both radial and linear flow cases. Thispaper presents actual regained permeability data ranges and then usesthis information in a reservoir simulator to assess the different damagemechanisms. Simulation results show that perceived damage problems areunrealistic, as even a very severe permeability reduction in the invadedzone does not significantly change well productivity. 11 refs., 10 figs.,1 tab.</TEXT></DOC>
