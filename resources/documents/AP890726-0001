The law Bush signed before a White House audience of members ofCongress from oil producing states and industry representativesremoves controls on the remaining one-third of natural gas suppliessubject to price ceilings. The ceilings will be abolished byJanuary 1993 for existing wells and by May 1991 for wells drilledfrom now on.   The end of price controls is expected to have little or noeffect in consumer markets since gas is selling well below thecurrent ceilings.   Years of price controls proved bad for producers and consumers,Bush contended, and were responsible for ``the damaging natural gasshortages of the '70s and for gas market distortions that exist tothis very day.''   Natural gas supplies one quarter of the nation's energy. A 1978law permitted the decontrol of most supplies starting in 1985, butthe bill Bush signed was necessary to free the rest.   Gas prices have fallen from a peak average of $2.69 per thousandcubic feet at the wellhead in 1984, when homeowners paid an averageof $6.12, to $1.71 last year, when homeowners averaged $5.46.   Bush called the natural gas deregulation his administration's``first major energy initiative.''   ``Experience shows that deregulation works to serve consumersand to serve an expanding economy,'' Bush said in a bill-signingceremony in the East Room. ``It's a tribute to the Americanpolitical system that after decades of disagreement over the meritsof gas decontrol we can gather here today to state a clear messagefor all to hear.   ``We have learned form the past. We are united in the convictionthat the best way to deal with our energy problems and serve theAmerican people is to let our market economy work.''   Bush announced he was directing Energy Secretary James Watkinsto come up with a national strategy that will seek to balance thenation's need for reasonably priced energy supplies, commitment toa safer and healthier environment, a strong economy and reduceddependence on foreign energy suppliers.   Bush said he would continue pushing for tax incentives to propup declining domestic oil production, although he acknowledged hewas unlikely to win action in Congress this year.   Many in the industry have advocated protective tariffs or importquotas to support domestic production, now only 62 percent ofconsumption, but both the Bush and the Reagan administrations haveresisted on the grounds such protection, by raising prices, wouldcost more jobs than it would preserve _ 400,000 vs. 120,000,according to a 1987 Energy Department study of a $10 per barreltariff.   The administration's policy drafting comes whenenvironmentalists are increasing their attacks on the use of fossilfuels, which worsens the ``greenhouse effect'' warming of theglobe, and when the Exxon Valdez tanker spill in Alaska hasprompted Congress to expand the areas of federal offshore watersthat are closed to oil and gas exploration.   Later, before skeptical members of the Senate Energy and NaturalResources Committee, Watkins defended the need for new hearings.   ``With the lack of credibiity my department has right now, Idon't think we can pontificate on what the energy policy shouldbe,'' Watkins said.   Sen. Wendell Ford, D-Ky., noted that national energy issues havebeen studied for a decade and ``it seems like we're kind ofstirring the broth again.''   ``This is no time for complacency,'' Bush said said. ``Ourenergy security problem continues. Conservation achievements areleveling off, domestic oil production continuing its downwardtrend. And petroleum imports are increasing. And our need for acleaner environment is obvious to all.''   Watkins cited several administration concerns: Domestic oilproduction is at its lowest point in 25 years while imports, stillalmost 20 percent below the 1977 peak, are 65 percent higher thanin 1985.   ``Environmental concerns are putting new pressures on ourability to use our most abundant domestic fuels like coal.Electricity reserve margins are shrinking across the country,''Watkins said.   Further, he said, public confidence in the energy industry ``isat a new low,'' aggravated by Alaska spill.   Even as Watkins was speaking, utilities in the P-J-M power poolserving 21 million people in most of New Jersey, Maryland andPennsylvania and all of Delaware and the District of Columbiaimposed a 5 percent voltage reduction, the third this year, topreserve generating capacity on a hot day of heavy electricitydemand when seven generating plants were out of service.   Watkins said his department will hold public hearings, beginningTuesday in Washington and followed by sessions in Tulsa, Okla. onAug. 8, Boise, Idaho on Aug. 23; Seattle on Aug. 30 and Louisville,Ky. on Sept. 8, all aimed at producing a draft plan by April 1.   He said the administration had no ``central preconceived focus''for the strategy and would evaluate every energy source, includingconservation. But he indicated he will be pushing for renewedemphasis on nuclear power.   He said he would be taking unspecified steps to keep New YorkState from dismantling the Shoreham nuclear power plant on LongIsland, a fully licensed plant that has never operated commercially.   Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, who attended the ceremony, saiddecontrolling natural gas ``takes this wet blanket that has crushedincentive off the industry'' and, with environmental concernsincreasing the attractiveness of gas, ``opens up the ability tohave a full-blown exploration boom.''   Sen. Bennett Johnston, D-La., chairman of the Senate Energy andNatural Resources Committee, said in a statement: ``Everybody is awinner.''</TEXT></DOC>
