The critical dimension as wellas the ghost number current anomaly is computed. Whereas the latter hasbeen found to vanish in the background covariant harmonic gauge, we obtainthe same result as in the conformal gauge. This apparent discrepancyis resolved by detecting a new anomaly pertaining to the background covariantversion of the harmonic gauge.</TEXT></DOC>
