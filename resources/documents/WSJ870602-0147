Neither is true.    The article implies that the anti-nuclear stance of the Greens is losing political support as evidenced by the recent election in Hesse. In fact, in this election where nuclear power was one of the focal issues, the Greens increased their voice by 60% and now represent 9.4% of the Hessian vote. Further, the article states that pro-nuclear forces gained a major victory when voters &quot;ousted the governing anti-nuclear coalition of Social Democrats and Greens.&quot; However, the Social Democrats themselves dissolved the coalition because the Greens would not drop their opposition to the opening of a nuclear reprocessing plant. The Social Democrats were gambling that anti-nuclear sentiment was on the decline, but they lost 6% of the electorate while the Greens gained 3%. In the context of this article, to say the Social Democrats are &quot;anti-nuclear&quot; seems to contradict the facts.    The Greens are totally nonviolent. They are the only nationally elected West German party advocating nonviolence as the sole means for conducting domestic and foreign policy. Your article identifies the Greens as leading the opposition to nuclear power and two sentences later states that &quot;demonstrations grew violent,&quot; without attributing the violence to anyone. The reader can only conclude the Greens are violent.    Nick Maravell   Potomac, Md.   ---   Your stories on the health impacts of the Chernobyl accident a year after the disaster presented a fair appraisal of information that has been developed by authoritative organizations, with one exception: the presentation of John Gofman's estimates. It is disappointing to see the Journal quote (and hence impute authority to) a source who has been so thoroughly and regularly discredited not only by organizations of his scientific peers, but also by judicial decisions on the credibility of his testimony in these matters.    To correct the record, the most recent Japanese data may provide a basis for changing current radiation-risk estimates but not nearly as much as the &quot;37 times greater&quot; asserted by Mr. Gofman. These data (primarily new estimates of radiation doses from the Japanese bombings) would suggest that current risk estimates might be increased by no more than a factor of about 3, a relatively minor change given the other risk modifiers identified in your article.    A more important message keeps failing to be recognized: the questionable applicability of using risk estimates based on single, huge exposures to bomb radiation to the very low radiation exposures of most Soviets and Europeans as a consequence of the Chernobyl disaster. These doses, even for the most exposed groups (other than those plant neighbors who were evacuated), are less than the additional radiation dose a resident of New York or Washington would receive if he lived in Denver for a year or two.    Thus, the additional cancers estimated to result in Europe from Chernobyl exposures are not different in magnitude (or in credibility) from similar estimates that could be made of increased cancer rates due to the much higher natural radiation exposures in Colorado. It is also a fact that vital statistics for that state do not show higher cancer rates than for the lower &quot;radiation zones&quot; elsewhere in the country.    Morton I.
