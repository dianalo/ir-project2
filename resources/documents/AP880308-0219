Several of the defense lawyers sought to dismiss the case afterbeing denied immediate access to the information, but U.S. DistrictJudge Robert E. Keeton deferred ruling on the requests until afterquestions over access to the FBI files are resolved.   Defense attorneys, at hearings outside the presence of the jury,have presented evidence in recent weeks of FBI infiltration ofLaRouche organizations.   They also have gained access to a one-page memo from retired AirForce Maj. Gen. Richard Secord to Marine Lt. Col. Oliver North, theformer National Security Council aide, in which Secord reports``our man here claims Lewis has collected info against LaRouche.''Lewis was not further identified.   The memo, found in North's safe after he was fired because ofhis role in the Iran-Contra affair, was surrendered to LaRouchedefense lawyers after the special prosecutor investigating thescandal acknowledged its existence.   Secord, reached Tuesday in Washington, said he could not recallthe memo and said he never had crossed paths with LaRouche. Secordwas one of North's principal operatives in his network of privateaid to the Contras.   Defense lawyers have said they will prove the Reaganadministration plotted to ruin LaRouche because he refused tosupport Reagan's programs to aid Nicaragua's Contra rebels. Theyalso argue that the government has improperly withheld evidencethat could prove their case, which could be grounds for dismissalof the charges.   They contend that North directed the FBI to gather informationagainst LaRouche and infiltrate his organizations as part of alarger FBI surveillance of groups opposed to the administration'sCentral American policies.   LaRouche, the aides and organizations all are charged withconspiring to cover up alleged credit card fraud by LaRouchesupporters during his 1984 presidential campaign. Four of theorganizations are charged with fraud. LaRouche is seeking the 1988Democratic presidential nomination, his fourth run for the WhiteHouse. He faces up to five years in prison if convicted.   Prosecutors throughout the trial and pretrial hearings denieddefense contentions that the government inflitrated LaRouche'sorganzations and concocted a credit card fraud and cover-up schemeto destroy LaRouche and his following.   After learning of the May 1986 Secord-North memo, defense lawyerMichael Reilly requested any information the government had aboutLaRouche and Lewis that might be favorable to defense claims.   The prosecutor in the case, Assistant U.S. Attorney JohnMarkham, surrendered documents from FBI files to Reilly, but theFBI later told Markham that he was not supposed to release thematerial.   Other defense attorneys now want copies of the documents, butthe FBI opposed the request on grounds the records are classified.Reilly, who represents just one of the five LaRouche organizationsthat are defendants, has said he cannot give the documents to hisfellow defense lawyers because of federal rules on classifiedinformation.   Markham, as the government attorney in the case, normally wouldargue the FBI's position. But he refused to do so Tuesday, sayingthere was a conflict of interest between the FBI's stance and hisrole as prosecutor of the case. He did not elaborate, but said theconflict would be resolved before the Wednesday hearing on accessto the records.   Keeton also told Markham he wants an explanation as to whydefense lawyers, through Freedom of Information Act requests, havelearned of the existence of thousands of other FBI documentsmentioning LaRouche that were not turned over to defense lawyersbefore the trial.   ``I've got to have some explanation from the government abouthow the documents are discoverable through FOIA requests and not bythe prosecution,'' the judge said.   After the questions over access to the records are resolved,defense lawyers have said they will renew their motions fordismissal of the case or a mistrial on grounds their openingstatements and cross-examination strategies would have beendifferent if they had reviewed the documents prior to trial.</TEXT></DOC>
