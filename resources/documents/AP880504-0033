But he'sobviously had enough taunts to last for the rest of the nominatingseason.   It's pretty tame stuff, especially compared with Jackson's 1984campaign rhetoric, but Democratic leaders already are urgingDukakis' sole remaining rival to tone down his rhetoric in the fiveweeks left in the primary season _ in hopes of maximizing thechance of defeating Vice President George Bush in November.   But whether Dukakis or anyone else can cause Jackson to back offis an open question. All they really can do without risking offenseto Jackson's following is to ask politely, and that doesn't exactlymake Dukakis sound like the strong, effective leader he wants thecountry to think he is.   ``I don't mind disagreements on issues,'' he said Tuesday nightas he celebrated his Midwestern victories while losing the Districtof Columbia. ``I just hope we can both continue to campaign withthe respect we've had for each other in the past year.''   For a man who has elevated caution to an art form, that amountsto a blunt statement that he's had enough of observations like thisJackson critique of Dukakis' style: ``The kitchen is clean andcool. Ain't nothing cooking.''   That is mild compared with Jackson's 1984 campaign, when hecomplained about party rules and waged a mini-platform fight at theparty convention that gave Walter F. Mondale his nomination, andDukakis and his aides must realize that.   Nonetheless, it's obviously beginning to nettle Dukakis. And itprobably delights Vice President George Bush and the men who areplanning his general election campaign as the designated Republicansuccessor to President Reagan.   Bush has taken a few shots of his own at Dukakis in recent days.Although aides say his candidacy will be based on the traditionalvirtues of peace and prosperity, the vice president has alreadyshown he's prepared to meet Dukakis' likely lines of attack head on.   Asked about Attorney General Edwin Meese and his legaldifficulties, Bush said he could ``go into a guilt-by-associationmode'' that involves Massachusetts politics or Dukakis' campaignstaff.   Asked about Dukakis' criticisms of the administration's handingof Panama, Bush replied, ``I can't wait for Mr. Dukakis to discussthe Noriega matter ... One of the beautiful things about being anew candidate without a heck of a lot of experience in foreignaffairs is you can make dramatic statements without necessarilyhaving the proof.''   All this is coming at Dukakis at the same time that Jackson hassharpened his rhetoric in the days following last week'sPennsylvania primary defeat.   Party leaders are already hinting to Jackson that with Tuesdaynight's landslides, it may be time to give Dukakis some breathingroom.   ``I would hope he wouldn't say anything that could be usedagainst Mike in the general election,'' Arkansas Gov. Bill Clintonsaid after Tuesday's primaries.   ``He has at every turn in the road said it's imperative for aDemocrat to be elected,'' said Clinton, who added that Dukakis hadasked governors to withhold their endorsements until he could provehimself in the primaries.   Most Democratic officials aren't interested in any additionaldebate as they seek to recapture the White House and end eightyears of Republican rule. After Gary Hart's two entrances and exitsfrom the campaign, not to mention Joseph Biden's politicalimmolation and a long winter of turbulent primary campaigning,they've had all the excitement they want.   ``It may be boring but I love it,'' said Democratic NationalCommittee Vice Chair Lynn Cutler as she surveyed a race that nowseems all but tucked away for Dukakis.   Judy Carnahan, the Oregon Democratic Party chair, said, ``WhereI am personally disappointed is that for so long Jackson did sowell as a coalition builder and bringing people together and thenwithin the last week or so seems to have a reverse type of positionand has started attacking Dukakis.   ``I find that very disappointing. What he's managing to do isdiminish his own stature.''   Under the ordinary rules of politics, Jackson would be long gonefrom the campaign, joining Bruce Babbitt, Gary Hart and the rest ofthe also-rans on the sidelines after going six weeks without aprimary victory.   But the normal rules of politics don't apply to Jackson, and forgood reason.   He alone of Dukakis' past and present rivals has a demonstrablefollowing that numbers in the millions and can make or break aDemocratic nominee in the race to succeed Reagan.</TEXT><TEXT>   EDITOR'S NOTE: Dave Espo covers presidential politics for TheAssociated Press.</TEXT></DOC>
