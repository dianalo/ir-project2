The data base presents a factographic automateddata retrieval system, containing test results on the 15Kh2NMFA, 15Kh2NMFA-A,15Kh2MFA, 10GN2MFA, 22K reactor vessel steels and also the data on theA533, A508 and A304 steels taken from literature. The system is realizedusing the VAN6 minicomputer and operates in a dialogue mode. Softwareof the system is arranged by module scheme and realized using the BASIClanguage. Results of tensile, impact, hardness, fatigue, brittle hardness,radiation resistance, high-temperature strength and heat-resistance testsand data on the thermal properties of the alloys are introduced intothe system. Prior to the input in the system the information is subjectedto additional expert analysis for completeness and authenticity. Themain function of the data base considered consists in the systematizationof a large volume of experimental data, which envisages arbitrary retrievaland subsequent analysis using statistical methods. The system containsapproximately 15 thousand records on magnetic discs. The total volumeof the store is 20 M byte. The system capabilities are demonstrated whenanalyzing the effects of aalloying additions on mechanical propertiesof the 15Kh2NMFA steel.</TEXT></DOC>
