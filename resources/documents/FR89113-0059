The petitioners (i.e. UARG and Cincinnati Gas andamp; ElectricCompany) have requested reconsideration under section 307(d)(7)(B) of theAct. Section 307(d)(7)(B) provides that ``if the person raising an objectioncan demonstrate to the Administrator that it was impracticable to raisesuch objection within [the comment period] if the grounds for such objectionarose after the period for public comment (but within the time specifiedfor judicial review) and if such objection is of central relevance to theoutcome of the rule, the Administrator shall convene a proceeding for reconsiderationof the rule [ ].'' As the relevant House report explains, the purpose ofsection 307(d)(7)(B) is to provide the Agency an opportunity ``to passon the significance of the [new] materials and determine whether supplementaryproceedings are called for or not.'' Legislative History of the Clean AirAct Amendments of 1977, Volume 4, p. 2790.In EPA's view, such objections are of central relevance only if they providesubstantial support for the argument that the standards should be revised.<T3>See</T3> Denial of Petition to Revise NSPS for Stationary Gas Turbines,45 FR 81653 (December 11, 1980); Response to Petition for Reconsiderationand Final Amendments, NSPS for Petroleum Dry Cleaners, 50 FR 49022 (November27, 1985).In reviewing the reconsideration petitions of UARG and Cincinnati Gas andamp;Electric Company, EPA has considered whether under section 307(d)(7)(B)of the Act, the petitions presented EPA with new material of central relevanceto the rule that could not have been presented before.\1\<NOTE/> As is discussed in detail elsewhere in today's <T4>Federal Register</T4>, it has decided that none of the petitions presentthat kind of material. Nevertheless, the Administrator has discretionaryauthority to reconsider or amend a rule at any time. The Administratorhas determined that with respect to one issue raised by Cincinnati Gasandamp; Electric and UARG_the NO<T2>x</T2> standard as applied to low capacity steam generating units burningcertain oils or natural gas_EPA agrees with UARG and the Zimmer owners.The proposed rule exempted all units, regardless of size or fuel consumed,from continuous emission monitors (CEM) requirements for NO<T2>x</T2> if they operated at 30 percent capacity or less. The final rulemodified the CEM exemption. It deleted the capacity factor criterion andsubstituted criteria related to size and fuel consumption in order to betterfit the CEM requirement to the units most likely to generate large quantitiesof NO<T2>x</T2>. Upon further consideration, EPA agrees that it is not reasonableto require continuous emission monitoring of emissions from very low capacityfactor steam generating units_even large ones_using certain low nitrogenfuels (very low nitrogen residual oil, distillate oil and natural gas).For that reason, EPA is proposing to revise the rule to require initialperformance testing and annual testing of large steam generating unitsand is proposing to exempt small steam generating units from NO<T2>x</T2> standards. The basis for and the details of the proposed actionare discussed below.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ Section 4(d) of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA),U.S.C. 553(e), states ``Each agency shall give an interested person theright to petition for issuance, amendment or repeal of a rule.'' Althoughsection 4(d) of the APA also establishes a right to petition for administrativereconsideration, that provision almost certainly does not apply to petitionsfor reconsideration of regulations that are promulgated pursuant to therulemaking provisions of section 307(d) of the Clean Air Act. <T3>See </T3>section 307 (d)(1)(N), 42 U.S.C. 7607(d)(1)(N). (``The provisionof section 553 through 557 * * * of title 5 of the United States Code shallnot, except as expressly provided in this subsection, apply to action towhich evaluating the petition for reconsideration under the APA are essentiallythe same as those for section 307(d)(7)(B) petitions. <T3>See</T3> Denial of Petition to Revise NSPS for Stationary Gas Turbines,45 FR 81653-54, and decision cited therein.<ITAG tagnum="84">Rationale for Proposed Amendments</ITAG>The UARG and the Zimmer owners submitted petitions for reconsiderationrequesting changes to the promulgated NO<T2>x</T2> standards as they applied to utility auxiliary steam generatingunits. As promulgated, the standards limited NO<T2>x</T2> emissions from industrial-commercial-institutional steam generatingunits with heat input capacity greater than 29 MW (100 million Btu/hour)for which consideration commenced after June 19, 1984 (51 FR 42768).As identified by the petitioners, utility auxiliary units are used at powerplants to assist in start-up of the main steam generating unit. These auxiliaryunits operate infrequently and typically exhibit very low annual capacityfactor levels. The petitions stated that the NO<T2>x</T2> standards would impose an unreasonable burden on these steamgenerating units. They, therefore, requested that the final NO<T2>x</T2> standards be amended to either: (1) Exempt utility auxiliarysteam generating units from the NO<T2>x</T2> standards; (2) exempt steam generating units from the NO<T2>x</T2> standards that operate at very low annual capacity factor levels,such as 10 percent or less; or (3) reduce the burden imposed by the performancetesting and monitoring requirements associated with the NO<T2>x</T2> standards on steam generating units that operate at such verylow annual capacity factors.In support of its petition, UARG submitted data for 20 utility auxiliarysteam generating units planned for construction in the 1985 to 1995 timeperiod which would be subject to the NO<T2>x</T2> standards, as promulgated. The annual capacity factor of theseunits was generally in the range of 5 to 8 percent, although several wereas low as 2 and 3 percent.Review of a survey of owners/operators of new industrial steam generatingunits constructed between 1981 and 1984, which the Agency conducted in1986-1987, indicates that utility auxiliary units are not the only typeof steam generating units that operate at such low capacity factors. Alimited number of industrial steam generating units also operate at verylow annual capacity factors of 10 percent or less. These industrial unitsfunction as stand-by or back-up steam generating units that are operatedonly when the primary steam generating unit must be taken out of operationfor some reason. The impacts of the promulgated NO<T2>x</T2> standards on steam generating units that operate at very lowannual capacity factors are essentially the same whether the units areutility auxiliary units or industrial stand-by or back-up units. Consequently,the same provisions should apply to both utility auxiliary and industrial-commercial-institutionalsteam generating units.Review of the data submitted by the petitioners, as well as that containedin the survey mentioned above, indicates that very low annual capacityfactor steam generating units tend to fire ``clean'' fuels such as naturalgas, distillate oil, or low nitrogen residual oils (i.e., residual oilswith nitrogen contents of 0.30 weight percent or less). Combustion of these``clean'' fuels results in much lower NO<T2>x</T2> emissions than combustion of ``dirty'' fuels, such as high nitrogenresidual oils or coal. Therefore, special provisions applicable to verylow annual capacity factor steam generating units should be limited tothose units firing ``clean'' fuels in order to minimize NO<T2>x</T2> emissions from such units.With these considerations in mind, the impacts associated with the promulgatedNO<T2>x</T2> standards were reviewed for steam generating units firing naturalgas, distillate oil, and low nitrogen residual oil at very low annual capacityfactors (i.e., less than 10 percent). The impacts were reviewed in termsfo the annual cost of NO<T2>x</T2> control (including the performance testing and monitoring requirements),the potential NO<T2>x</T2> reduction from these units, and the cost effectiveness of theNO<T2>x</T2> standards.As promulgated, the NO<T2>x</T2> standards for a typical steam generating unit with a heat inputcapacity of 73 MW (250 million Btu/hour) or less and firing natural gas,distillate oil, or low nitrogen residual oil are based on low excess air(LEA) operation. The standards require a 30-day intitial performance test,continuous monitoring of either NO<T2>x</T2> emissions or combustion parameters indicative of NO<T2>x</T2> emissions, and the submittal of quarterly excess emission reports(semiannual reports if no excess emissions occurred). The NO<T2>x</T2> standards for a large steam generating unit with a heat inputcapacity greater than 73 MW (250 million Btu/hour) and firing natural gas,distillate oil, or low nitrogen residual oil are based on staged combustionand low NO<T2>x</T2> burners. The standards require a 30-day initial performancetest, continuous monitoring of NO<T2>x</T2> emissions using a continuous emission monitoring system (CEMS)for continuous compliance (including Appendix F quality assurance procedures),and the submittal of quarterly reports including emissions data and theresults of the Appendix F procedures.Thus, the population of industrial-commercial-institutional steam generatingunits subject to the promulgated NO<T2>x</T2> standards can be divided into two groups for analysis. The impactson a typical steam generating unit [i.e., one with heat input capacitiesbetween 29 MW (100 million Btu/hour) and 73 MW (250 million Btu/hour)]can be considered by examining a steam generating unit with a heat inputcapacity of 44 MW (150 million Btu/hour). The impacts on a large steamgenerating unit [i.e., one with a heat input capacity of greater than 73MW (250 million Btu/hour)] can be considered by examining a steam generatingunit with a heat input capacity of 117 MW (400 million Btu/hour).For a typical steam generating unit with a heat input capacity of 44 MW(150 million Btu/hour), operating at 10 percent annual capacity factor,using LEA as the NO<T2>x</T2> control technique, and firing natural gas, distillate oil, orlow nitrogen residual oil, the annual cost associated with the NO<T2>x</T2> standards (control equipment, performance test, and monitor)would be $65,000 to $75,000 per year. For a large-sized steam generatingunit with a heat input capacity of 117 MW (400 million Btu/hour), operatingat 10 percent annual capacity factor, using staged combustion or low NO<T2>x</T2> burners to control NO<T2>x</T2> emissions, and firing natural gas, distillate oil, or low nitrogenresidual oil, the annual cost would be $130,000 to $150,000 per year. TheNO<T2>x</T2> reductions that would be achieved by these steam generatingunits would be less than 2 tons per year for the typical unit and approximately20 tons per year for the large unit.The estimated emission reductions associated with the standards are notablefor the large steam generating unit. The cost effectiveness of NO<T2>x</T2> control for these very low capacity units, however, appearsto be quite high [i.e., $5,000 to $8,000 per ton of NO<T2>x</T2> for the large 117 MW (400 million Btu/hour) unit and $43,000to $49,000 per ton of NO<T2>x</T2> for the typical 44 MW (150 million Btu/hour) unit]. Since thecost effectiveness of NO<T2>x</T2> control is ``driven,''in this case, by the cost of the performancetesting and monitoring requirements, the impacts associated with alternativeand less burdensome performance testing and monitoring requirements wereanalyzed.To derive these cost estimates, EPA assumed that all very low capacityfactor units would vent to the atmosphere 100 percent of the steam generatedin performance tests. Thus, the fuel used to fire these units is a majorcomponent of the cost of complying with the performance testing requirementsof the current standards. The EPA solicits comments on the approach usedto determine the cost effectiveness, especially the assumption that allsteam would be vented to the atmosphere.The application of NO<T2>x</T2> control through the use of techniques such as LEA or stagedcombustion generally makes combustion more difficult to sustain in a steamgenerating unit. Thus, the unit generally becomes more difficult to operateand requires more frequent and greater operator attention. The naturaltendency, therefore, is for the operator to decrease the amount of LEAor staged combustion in order to make operation of the steam generatingunit easier. As this occurs, NO<T2>x</T2> emissions increase and NO<T2>x</T2> emission reductions decrease.As a result, continuous monitoring of NO<T2>x</T2> emissions (either directly by the use of a continuous emissionmonitor, or indirectly by monitoring combustion parameters indicative ofNO<T2>x</T2> emissions) is necessary to provide complete assurance of NO<T2>x</T2> emission reductions. As the frequency of NO<T2>x</T2> monitoring decreases, the assurance of actual NO<T2>x</T2> emission reductions decreases, and the NO<T2>x</T2> standards become less meaningful.The only alternative to continuous monitoring of NO<T2>x</T2> is periodic, short-term NO<T2>x</T2> performance tests. Because this alternative is less rigorousthan continuous monitoring, however, it will undoubtedly lead to some increasein NO<T2>x</T2> emissions above the levels that could be maintained throughthe use of continuous monitoring. Despite this drawback, periodic shortterm performance tests are a useful tool for enforcement and will permitenforcement personnel to monitor periodically the compliance status ofsteam generating units operating at very low annual capacity factors.The requirement of an initial 24-hour NO<T2>x</T2> performance test followed by 3-hour NO<T2>x</T2> performance tests (conducted annually or after every 400 hoursof operation, whichever comes first) reduces the cost effectiveness ofthe NO<T2>x</T2> standards to about $300 per ton for a large steam generatingunit. For a typical steam generating unit, however, even these requirementsresult in a NO<T2>x</T2> cost effectiveness greater than $3,000 per ton.The changes being proposed today, therefore, would amend the promulgatedNO<T2>x</T2> standards in two ways. First, less burdensome performance testingand monitoring requirements for NO<T2>x</T2> emissions are proposed for large steam generating units [i.e.,those greater than 73 MW (250 million Btu/hour) heat input] firing naturalgas, distillate oil, or low nitrogen residual oil (either alone or in combination),and operating at 10 percent annual capacity factor or less. These unitswould be required to perform an initial short-term performance test (minimum24-hour) for NO<T2>x</T2> emissions within 60 days after achieving the maximum productionrate, but not later than 180 days after initial start-up to demonstratecompliance with the NO<T2>x</T2> standards and to confirm their maximum heat input capacity.This initial test would be followed by a short-term (minimum 3-hour) NO<T2>x</T2> performance test (conducted annually or after every 400 hoursof operation, whichever comes first) to verify continued compliance usingMethod 7, 7A, or other approved methods, or using a CEMS.Second, an exemption from the NO<T2>x</T2> standards and monitoring requirements is proposed for typicalsteam generating units [i.e., those of less than 73 MW (250 million Btu/hour)heat input] that fire natural gas, distillate oil, or low nitrogen residualoil (either alone or in combination), and operate at 10 percent annualcapacity factor or less. The reason for the exemption is the lack of acost-effective method of monitoring No<T2>x</T2> emissions. These units would be required, however, to performan initial short-term test (minimum 24-hour) to confirm their maximum heatinput capacity. This is necessary to ensure that these steam generatingunits will, in fact, operate at 10 percent annual capacity factor or less.Sources will also be required to maintain fuel records to demonstrate thatthey are using the ``clean'' fuels. The estimated increase in No<T2>x</T2> emissions resulting from the proposed exemption for typicalsteam generating units is less than 50 tons per year. The promulgated standardsprojected approximately 25,000 tons of NO<T2>x</T2> reduction per year in the fifth year following promulgation.This proposed revision would affect fewer than 30 steam generating unitsout of the 604 units projected to be constructed in the 5 years followingpromulgation. No solid waste or liquid waste environmental impacts areassociated with these proposed revisions. <ITAG tagnum="84">Miscellaneous </ITAG>Under Executive Order 12291, a rulemaking action must be examined to determineif it is a ``major rule'' and, therefore, subject to certain requirementsof the Order. Today's rulemaking action would result in none of the adverseeconomic effects set forth in section 1 of the Order as grounds for findinga regulation to be a ``major rule.'' This rulemaking action would resultin a reduced burden on the industrial-commercial-institutional steam generatingunit source category. It would not result in any increase in costs or pricesand would not disrupt market competition. This revision, therefore, wouldnot be a ``major rule'' under Executive Order 12291. Under section 317 of the Clean Air Act, an economic impact assessment mustbe prepared for revisions that are determined to be substantial. Theserevisions are not substantial; as a result, an economic impact assessmenthas not been prepared. Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Administrator certifies that these revisionswould not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities.The revisions would reduce the burden on this source category, and it hasalready been determined that, in the absence of these revisions, the standardswould not affect a substantial number of small entities (51 FR 42787 and42788, November 25, 1986). <ITAG tagnum="84">Paperwork Reduction Act </ITAG>Changes to the information requirements as proposed in today's notice havebeen submitted for approval to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)under the <T3>Paperwork Reduction Act</T3>, 44 U.S.C. 3501 <T3>et seq. </T3>An Information Collection Request document has been preparedby EPA (ICR No. 1088) and a copy may be obtained by writing Carla Levesque,Information Policy Branch, Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M Street,SW.
