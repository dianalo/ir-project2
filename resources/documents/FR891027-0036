While the taxonomic statusof this species has not been questioned in the literature, there has beenconsiderable discussion of the genus. It has been placed in <T3>Unio, Lampsilis, Metaptera, Margarita, Margaron, </T3>and<T3> Proptera,</T3> in addition to the other names discussed here (Simpson1914, Clarke 1986, Hartfield 1988). <T3>Potamilus</T3> is accepted as the correct generic name by numerousauthors (Morrison 1969, Valentine and Stansbery 1971, Clark 1986, Tergeon<T3>et al</T3>. 1988). The common name in general usage for this specieshas been the Alabama heelsplitter. This rule follows the common names asused in Turgeon <T3>et al</T3>. (1988) in support of the effort to standardize nomenclatureof mussels.The inflated heelsplitter was known historically from the Amite and TangipahoaRivers, Louisiana; the Pearl River, Mississippi; and the Tombigbee, BlackWarrior, Alabama, and Coosa Rivers, Alabama (Hurd 1974, Stern 1976, Hartfield1988). The presently known distribution is limited to the Amite River,Louisiana, and the Tombigbee and Black Warrior Rivers, Alabama (Stern 1976,Hartfield 1988). The collection of this species from the Pearl River byHinckley was reported by Frierson (1911) and a single valve collected byParker is curated in the National Museum of Natural History (Dr. JamesWilliams, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, pers. comm. 1988). There areno other reported collections from the Pearl River (Hartfield 1988). Asingle specimen was collected from the Tangipahoa River, Louisiana, in1964 by Stein and Stansbery (Dr. David Stansbery, Ohio State University,pers. comm. 1985). Hartfield (1988) did not find the species in the TangipahoaRiver during his survey. Hurd (1974) doubted the occurrence of this speciesin the Coosa River based upon the single lot available in museums. Thespecies has not been reported from the Coosa or Alabama Rivers in over20 years (Hurd 1974, Hartfield 1988).The inflated heelsplitter has an oval, compressed to moderately inflated,thin shell. The valves may gape anteriorly, the umbos are low, and thereis a prominent posterior wing that may extend anterior to the beaks inyoung individuals. The shell is brown to black and may have green raysin young individuals. The umbonal cavity is very shallow and the nacreis pink to purple. Shell length reaches 140 millimeters (5\1/2\ inches)in adults (Stern 1976). It is most similar to the pink papershell (<T3>Potamilus ohioensis</T3>), yet is easily distinguished by shell morphology(Hartfield 1988). The shell and teeth of the inflated heelsplitter aremore delicate, and the shell is darker and has a pointed posterior, whereasthe pink papershell has a rounded posterior. The inflated heelsplitterappears more inflated due to a more developed and rounded posterior ridge.The posterior wing of the inflated heelsplitter is more pronounced andabruptly rounded over the dorsum. The pink papershell may lack much ofa wing, and when pronounced, it may be only slightly rounded and extendscarcely above the dorsum (Hartfield 1988). Lending further taxonomic strengthto this species distinction is the occurrence of the pink papershell inlakes and sloughs, while the inflated heelsplitter has not been found inthis habitat.The preferred habitat of this species is soft, stable substrates in slowto moderate currents (Stern 1976). It has been found in sand, mud, siltand sandy-gravel, but not in large gravel or armored gravel (Hartfield1988). It is usually collected on the protected side of bars and may occurin depths over 20 feet. The occurrence of this species in silt may notindicate that the life cycle can be successful in that substrate (Hartfield1988). Adult mussels may survive limited amounts of silt where juvenileswould suffocate. The occurrence of this species in silt may be becauseit was established prior to deposition of the silt.The inflated heelsplitter, <T3>Potamilus inflatus</T3>, was listed as a category 2 candidate (a taxonfor which data in the Service's possession indicate listing is possiblyappropriate) in the notice of review published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on May 22, 1984 (49 FR 21664) and January 6,1989 (54 FR 554).<ITAG tagnum="84">Summary of Factors Affecting the Species</ITAG>Section 4(a)(1) of the Endangered Species Act (16 U.S.C. 1531 <T3>et seq</T3>.) and regulations (50 CFR part 424) promulgated to implementthe listing provisions of the Act set forth the procedures for adding speciesto the Federal lists. A species may be determined to be endangered or threateneddue to one or more of the five factors described in section 4(a)(1). Thesefactors and their application to the inflated heelsplitter (<T3>Potamilus inflatus</T3>) are as follows:A. <T3>The present or threatened destruction, modification, or curtailmentof its habitat or range</T3>. The inflated heelsplitter historically occurredin the Amite and Tangipahoa Rivers, Louisiana; the Pearl River, Mississippi;and the Tombigbee, Black Warrior, Alabama, and Coosa Rivers, Alabama (Hurd1974, Stern 1976, Hartfield 1988, 1989). It is currently known from onlythe Amite, Tombigbee and Black Warriors Rivers. Only one specimen has beencollected from the Tangipahoa River, and in a recent survey by Hartfield(1988) no additional specimens were found. Hartfield found the upper TangipahoaRiver to be much smaller than areas where this species occurs in otherrivers. The stretch of the Tangipahoa River where the one specimen wascollected has been severely eroded in recent years, presumably by gravelmining (Hartfield 1988).The inflated heelsplitter has been reported from two areas on the PearlRiver, Mississippi. One site was in the lower Pearl downstream of Bogalusa,Louisiana (Williams pers. comm. 1988) and the other site was near Jackson,Mississippi (Frierson 1911). The exact collecting site is unknown for bothof these records. The Pearl River near Jackson has been impacted by pollution,channelization, and flood control levees and by an impoundment for recreationand a municipal water supply. The lower Pearl River near Bogalusa has beenimpacted by channel erosion, habitat modification for navigation, and industrialand urban pollution (Hartfield 1988). Based upon the scarcity of recordsfrom the Coosa River, Hurd (1974) doubted the historic occurrence of thisspecies in that system. It has not been reported from that system sincethe construction of impoundments for flood control and hydropower.The type specimen was reported from the Alabama River by Lea (1831) andhas been reported from this same river by others (Conrad 1834, Simpson1914). However, it has not been collected from the Alabama River in manyyears, presumably due to the impoundment of that system for navigation,flood control, and hydropower (Hartfield 1989).The only known site for this species in the Black Warrior River is belowWarrior Dam near Eutaw, Alabama. A single specimen was collected by Gracein the mid-1970's (Williams, pers. comm. 1985). A survey by Service diversin 1989 found two fresh dead shells but no live individuals. The speciesundoubtedly continues to survive in the Black Warrior River below WarriorDam. The remainder of the Black Warrior River has been impacted by impoundmentfor navigation sedimentation from surface mining.The species continues to survive in the Tombigbee River in at least twolocalities, Gainesville Bendway and downstream of Jackson Dam. Most ofthe Tombigbee River was modified by construction of the Tennessee-TombigbeeWaterway. This resulted in the loss of riverine habitat by impoundment,channelization, and flow diversion. Habitat that was originally believedwould continue to support mussel populations has been destroyed by heavyaccumulations of sediment. The only known population of the inflated heelsplitterin the Waterway is below Gainesville Spillway where the normal river flow,with the exception of navigation lockages, is released from this impoundment(Paul Hartfield, Mississippi Department of Wildlife Conservation, pers.comm. 1989). This has maintained a relatively clean and stable habitatsuitable to this species.The only other known population in the Tombigbee River occurs downstreamof Jackson Dam. In this stretch, the species has been collected by Serviceand Mississippi Department of Wildlife Conservation biologists at foursites over a 12-river-mile area. Below the lowermost of these collectionsites, no mussels were found by surveys in 1985 and 1986 by Service andDepartment biologists, possibly due to impacts from industrial effluents.The entire Tombigbee River has been modified for navigation by impoundmentand channelization, and frequent dredging is required to maintain the navigationchannel. Navigation dredging threatens this population by the depositionof spoil on bars along the sides of the river channel (Hartfield 1988).This material washes onto mussel habitat below the bars and may suffocatemussels and make conditions unfavorable for recruitment.This species continues to exist in the Amite River with major threats beinggravel mining and proposed channel modification for flood control. Hartfield(1989) concluded that 30 percent of the range of this species in the AmiteRiver had been lost since 1976, primarily due to gravel mining. Withoutprotection, this loss is expected to continue with the intensive gravelmining and resulting headcutting that is ongoing. The Corps of Engineersand Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development are studyingmethods of flood control on the Amite River. The proposed Darlington Reservoirwould be constructed upstream of existing inflated heelsplitter habitat,and the actual impoundment of the stream may not impact this populationof the species. The impact of this reservoir will likely be determinedby the type and method of water releases incorporated. A deep water releasewould result in colder water temperatures, which may interrupt the lifecycle of this mussel. The control of water flows, especially during lowwater levels, could strand mussels on dry bars and may reduce the capacityof the river to flush sediments from mussel habitat. An alternative floodcontrol measure under consideration is the widening and channelizationof the Amite River. This potential action would likely eliminate the inflatedheelsplitter from the Amite River, leaving the only population in the Tombigbeeand Black Warrior system.B. <T3>Overutilization for commercial, recreational, scientific, or educationalpurposes.</T3> The species is not of commercial value at this time andany collecting is likely to be for scientific purposes. Over collectionis not considered a threat.C. <T3>Disease or predation.</T3> Diseases are not known for mussels, althoughunexplained dieoffs have occurred. Predation may exist to a limited extentwhen muskrats and raccoons prey on mussels. This would have a minimal effectsince this species seems to prefer deeper water.D. <T3>The inadequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms.</T3> Existing lawsare inadequate to protect this species. It is not recognized by Alabamaor Louisiana as needing any special protection, although both States requirea scientific collector's permit. Collection, however, is likely to go undetecteddue to the limited enforcement personnel available and higher prioritydemands on their time. The species is not given any special considerationunder other environmental laws when project impacts are reviewed.E. <T3>Other natural or manmade factors affecting its continued existence.</T3>The known populations are isolated from each other and apparently are limitedin extent. This could result in low genetic variation and make these populationsmore susceptible to environmental disturbance due to loss of adaptability.The Service has carefully assessed the best scientific and commercial informationavailable regarding the past, present, and future threats faced by thisspecies in determining to propose this rule. Based on this evaluation,the preferred action is to list the inflated heelsplitter as threatened.Threatened status was chosen because the species still exists in threerivers, and the range within two of these rivers consists of reproducingpopulations that are widely distributed and not subject to single eventimpacts.<ITAG tagnum="84">Critical Habitat</ITAG>Section 4(a)(3) of the Act, as amended, requires that, to the maximum extentprudent and determinable, the Secretary propose critical habitat at thetime the species is proposed to be endangered or threatened. The Servicefinds that designation of critical habitat is not presently prudent forthis species due to the lack of benefit from such designation. All Federaland State agencies likely to be involved have been notified of the locationand importance of protecting this species' habitat. No additional benefitswould accrue from a critical habitat designation that would not accruefrom the listing. Precise locality data are available to appropriate agenciesthrough the Service office described in the ADDRESSES section. Protectionof this species' habitat will be addressed through the recovery processand through the Section 7 jeopardy standard. Therefore, it would not nowbe prudent to determine critical habitat for the inflated heelsplitter.<ITAG tagnum="84">Available Conservation Measures</ITAG>Conservation measures provided to species listed as endangered or threatenedunder the Endangered Species Act include recognition, recovery actions,requirements for Federal protection, and prohibitions against certain practices.Recognition through listing encourages and results in conservation actionsby Federal, State, and private agencies, groups, and individuals. The EndangeredSpecies Act provides for possible land acquisition and cooperation withthe States and requires that recovery actions be carried out for all listedspecies. The protection required of Federal agencies and the prohibitionsagainst taking and harm are discussed, in part, below.Section 7(a) of the Act, as amended, requires Federal agencies to evaluatetheir actions with respect to any species that is proposed or listed asendangered or threatened and with respect to its critical habitat, if anyis being designated. Regulations implementing this interagency cooperationprovision of the Act are codified at 50 CFR part 402. Section 7(a)(4) requiresFederal agencies to confer informally with the Service on any action thatis likely to jeopardize the continued existence of a proposed species,or result in destruction or adverse modification of proposed critical habitat.If a species is listed subsequently, section 7(a)(2) requires Federal agenciesto ensure that activities they authorize, fund, or carry out are not likelyto jeopardize the continued existence of such a species or to destroy oradversely modify its critical habitat. If a Federal action may affect alisted species or its critical habitat, the responsible Federal agencymust enter into formal consultation with the Service.Federal involvement is expected to include the Environmental ProtectionAgency in consideration of the Clean Water Act, pesticide registration,and waste management actions. The Corps of Engineers will include thisspecies in project planning and operation and during the permit reviewprocess. The Federal Highway Administration will consider impacts of bridgeand road construction at points where known habitat is crossed. Continuingurban development within the drainage basins may involve the Farmers HomeAdministration and their loan programs.The Act and implementing regulations found at 50 CFR 17.21 and 17.31 setforth a series of general prohibitions and exceptions that apply to allthreatened wildlife. These prohibitions, in part, make it illegal for anyperson subject to the jurisdiction of the United States to take (includesharass, harm, pursue, hunt, shoot, wound, kill, trap, or collect; or toattempt any of these), import or export, ship in interstate commerce inthe course of commercial activity, or sell or offer for sale in interstateor foreign commerce any listed species. It also is illegal to possess,sell, deliver, carry, transport, or ship any such wildlife that has beentaken illegally. Certain exceptions apply to agents of the Service andState conservation agencies.Permits may be issued to carry out otherwise prohibited activities involvingthreatened wildlife species under certain circumstances. Regulations governingpermits are at 50 CFR 17.22, 17.23, and 17.32. Such permits are availablefor scientific purposes, to enhance the propagation or survival of thespecies, and/or for incidental take in connection with otherwise lawfulactivities. For threatened species, there are also permits for zoologicalexhibition, educational purposes, or special purposes consistent with thepurposes of the Act.<ITAG tagnum="84">Public Comments Solicited</ITAG>The Service intends that any final action resulting from this proposalwill be as accurate and as effective as possible. Therefore, comments orsuggestions from the public, other concerned governmental agencies, thescientific community, industry, or any other interested party concerningthis proposed rule are hereby solicited. Comments particularly are soughtconcerning:(1) Biological, commercial trade, or other relevant data concerning anythreat (or lack thereof) to this species;(2) The location of any additional populations of this species and thereasons why any habitat should or should not be determined to be criticalhabitat as provided by section 4 of the Act;(3) Additional information concerning the range, distribution, and populationsize of this species; and(4) Current or planned activities in the subject area and their possibleimpacts on this species.Final promulgation of the regulation on this species will take into considerationthe comments and any additional information received by the Service, andsuch communications may lead to a final regulation that differs from thisproposal.The Endangered Species Act provides for a public hearing on this proposal,if requested. Requests must be received within 45 days of the date of publicationof the proposal. Such requests must be made in writing and addressed toComplex Field Supervisor (see ADDRESSES section).<ITAG tagnum="84">National Environmental Policy Act</ITAG>The Fish and Wildlife Service has determined that an Environmental Assessment,as defined under the authority of the National Environmental Policy Actof 1969, need not be prepared in connection with regulations adopted pursuantto section 4(a) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended.
