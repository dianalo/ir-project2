Little, Inc., Cambridge, Mass.andP;  The studyestimates $24 billion in annual benefits if 10-20% of activities currentlyrequiring transportation are performed by telecommunications.andP;  Increasing theuse of this technology would also eliminate at least 1.8 million tons ofpollutants, save 3.5 billion gallons of gas, and free up 3.1 billion personalhours for increased productivity or leisure time.andM;SUCCESSFUL TRIP...andP;  A solution to the infamous traveling salesman problem(TSP) has been drawn by two mathematicians from Purdue University and Du PontCo.andP;  The classic TSP--to determine the shortest or least costly route for asalesman to travel to visit a set number of cities and then return to hisstarting point having never retraced his steps--has defied mathematiciansworldwide for hundreds of years.andP;  In turn, the TSP represents importantunsolved scientific and engineering problems.andP;  The new algorithm, which givesan exact answer to some types of TSPs but not all, may have severalindustrial/engineering applications.andP;  The mathematicians detailed theirfindings in Science last February.andM;OOPS EFFORTS...andP;  A joint project to demonstrate the feasibility of usingobject-oriented technology to perform complex scientific simulations has beenformed by MCC, Sandia National Laboratories and the Institute for AdvancedTechnology of the University of Texas.andP;  The simulation program beingdeveloped for this proof of principle demonstration is a version of the CTHproduction code used to perform complex simulations of the behavior of solidmaterials struck by a hypervelocity projectile.andP;  Last year the DoD listedhypervelocity projectiles on its Critical Technologies Plan for the 1990s.andM;FUNGUS FINDERS...andP;  For centuries French merchants have used specially traineddogs and pigs to sniff out the black Perigord truffle.andP;  Sprouted from treeroots, these pungent underground delicacies retail for more than $600 perpound.andP;  With demand now surpassing supply, the industry is foregoingtradition and looking for help from computerized truffle trackers.andP;  Abiochemist at the University of Manchester's Institute of Science andTechnology has recorded a 75% success rate in finding fungi buried as deeplyas 10 inches--using an electronic scanner that detects the chemical compoundscreated by the truffle's aroma.andP;  French scientists are also working on asensing device they hope will be small enough to carry on the shoulder andless expensive than the upkeep of a dog.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
