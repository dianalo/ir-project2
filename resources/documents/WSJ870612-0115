Consider that until the early 1960s, American Airlines, a unit of AMR Corp., kept track of flight reservations on blackboards. Today, its Sabre computer reservation system routinely handles 50 million electronic transactions a day.    This and other computer-reservation systems have made possible many of the innovations of the deregulated era: discount fares, frequent-flier programs, advance-boarding passes and seat assignments and instant reservations through travel agents.    The industry's technological track record in other areas is spottier: The know-how is there, but the willingness or ability to use it lags far behind. Travelers today still wait in long lines at baggage check-in or at the departure gate -- procedures that can be automated. Also, technology exists that could let people buy airplane tickets at the local 7-Eleven or let travel agents send tickets via computer directly to a client's office. But only in the past year has the industry started to employ the new technologies.    Safety is another deficient area. Advanced technology in air-traffic radar, collision avoidance and wind-shear detection could be put in place tomorrow, say some who study the industry.    &quot;Technology in the airline industry is the most advanced in the transportation industry,&quot; says Yupo Chan, a professor of civil engineering and aviation expert at Washington State University. &quot;The problem is implementation.&quot;    One barrier: the cost of safety-related technology, a factor that is bigger than ever in today's highly competitive market. Government regulators also seem loath to push for more safety features, given airlines' objections to additional rules that could boost ticket prices to a level beyond what most consumers would pay to fly.    Such delays don't occur when the technology pays. It was only about a decade ago that the first travel agents were equipped with computer terminals that linked them directly to all flight information. Today, more than 95% of travel agents use a computer reservation system, says the American Society of Travel Agents, a trade group.    For the industry's leaders, the systems are cash cows: AMR's Sabre generated only 6.5% of the company's revenue but nearly a third of its operating profit last year.    This computer technology also enables carriers to juggle fares on individual flights, seeking the right mix of deep-discount fares and full coach prices that may discriminate against full-fare passengers but boost load factors and profit margins. At today's fare levels, airline executives say, the industry would be wallowing in red ink if it couldn't manage fares with computers.    Not everyone has benefited. The carriers that didn't move aggressively to automate reservations systems now find themselves at a disadvantage. A major cause of the downfall of People Express, which brought cheap fares to millions of travelers, was its lack of a sophisticated computer system to manage its discount fares.    Further developments are likely soon. This month, United Airlines will open its &quot;terminal of tomorrow&quot; in Chicago. Passengers there will use automated tickets, which will encode everything from flight, hotel and rental-car reservations to baggage-claim information on a magnetic strip on the back of the ticket.    The next decade also could bring the first major revolution in aircraft-engine technology since the jet engine was introduced commercially in the 1950s. About a year ago, the industry began conducting test flights of new &quot;propfan&quot; engines, an engine powered by a high-speed propeller. The efficient engines could be in use by the early 1990s and help the industry cope with almost certain increases in aviation-fuel prices.
