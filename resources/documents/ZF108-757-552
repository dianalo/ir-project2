(distributing newsletter replies via E-mail)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Tarter, Jeffrey.andM;</AUTHOR><DESCRIPT/><TEXT>Thanks to E-mail enthusiast Philippe Kahn, we've just learned about anundocumented feature of MCI Mail, the service we've been using to distributean electronic version of Soft*letter.andP;  It turns out that readers of amulti-recipient message--like this newsletter--can use MCI Mail to broadcasta response to everyone on the original distribution list.andP;  Kahn recently tookadvantage of this feature to send a comment to our entire MCI Mail readershipdiscussing Lotus' lawsuit against his company  (Soft*letter, 7/16/90).andP;  Atfirst, we were ticked off to discover that an outsider could so easily getaccess to our proprietary subscriber list.andP;  But then we had a kinder andgentler thought: Why not turn our MCI Mail edition into a more-or-lessprivate forum for software industry insiders? our readership already includesmost of the industry's movers and shakers, and it might be interesting tohear their reactions to key issues directly.andP;  (In the spirit of fairness, wealso think it's a nice idea to let the targets of our occasional open letterstell their side of the story.)andM;So we've decided to extend freedom of the press (the electronic press, thatis) to anyone who gets our electronic edition.andP;  The big risk, of course, isthat we'll open a direct channel to our readers that will be choked byover-zealous public relations types and assorted self-promoters.andP;  We can'tfigure out how to prevent that kind of abuse, but we're keeping our fingerscrossed that it won't happen so often that we have to shut down the forum.andO;In the meantime, here's how to publish a response to an issue of Soft*letter:When an issue arrives by MCI Mail, simply type &quot;AN EA&quot; (short for ANSWEREACH) or &quot;RE EN&quot; (short for READ ENVELOPE) at the command line.andP;  You'll seethe MCI addresses of all of our active electronic edition readers, currentlyabout a hundred names.andP;  Then just create a message and send it like anordinary MCI letter.andP;  That's all it takes.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
