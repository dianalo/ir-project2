It's uncut, fully restored and color-tinted, as was the original.    Saturday, Jan. 10, 10-11 p.m. EST, on HBO (additional play dates include Jan. 13, 16, 19, 25 and 29): &quot;Humor and the Presidency.&quot; Was Gerald Ford amused, back in the mid-1970s, when comedian Chevy Chase immortalized him as the pratfall president? Find out by watching this special, hosted by Mr. Ford and his wife, Betty, and featuring Mr. Chase along with several other politicians, comedians, cartoonists and journalists.    Monday, Jan. 12, 7:30-9 a.m. EST, on CBS: &quot;Morning Program.&quot; If you want &quot;hard&quot; news, you'll have to get up at 6 and catch the rescheduled and revamped &quot;CBS Morning News,&quot; with co-anchors Faith Daniels and Forrest Sawyer. Then at 7:30, go &quot;soft&quot; with this new, live &quot;entertainment and information&quot; show co-hosted (not co-anchored) by Mariette Hartley and Rolland Smith. Whatever you do, don't tell CBS that you can't tell hard from soft!    Monday-Friday, Jan. 12-16, 8-9 p.m. EST and every subsequent Tuesday, 8-9 p.m. EST, on Aandamp;E (also midnight-1 a.m.): &quot;Golden Age of Television.&quot; The drama anthology shows of the late-1950s and early-1960s recaptured: These half-hour segments are taken from the Alcoa-Goodyear Award Theatre.    Wednesday, Jan. 14, 8-9 p.m. EST, on CBS: &quot;My Dissident Mom.&quot; &quot;Schoolbreak Specials&quot; are designed for afternoon viewing by young people. Yet the network feels that this one, about an anti-nuke housewife and a defense-contractor husband, deserves a prime-time airing. I recommend it not because it's good -- the simplemindedness of the ideas is surpassed only by the clumsiness of the execution -- but because I think parents should know what sort of slop the networks are serving their children.    Wednesday, Jan. 14, 9-10:30 p.m. EST, on PBS (10-11:30 p.m. EST on WNET/Thirteen): &quot;Mother Teresa.&quot; In this age of media glut, even a saint can be reduced to sound bites, photo opportunities and late-night talk-show jokes. But not Mother Teresa -- not as long as this superbly crafted, deeply felt film is around to keep us honest. (More in Monday's TV column.)    Saturday, Jan. 17, 4:30-6 p.m. EST, on ABC: The Ironman Triathlon. Dive in, along with 1,250 others, for a 2.4-mile ocean swim, a 112-mile bike ride and a 26-mile, 385-yard marathon run. What better way to see Hawaii?    Saturday, Jan. 17, 10-11 p.m. EST, on HBO (additional play dates include Jan. 20, 25 and 30): &quot;Heartbeat.&quot; The longest music video yet: Don Johnson as a heroic journalist wounded in a nameless Central American country who becomes feverish and watches his whole life passing before his eyes to the sounds of his new LP. And we thought the triathlon was tiring!    Monday, Jan. 19, 9-11 p.m. EST, on PBS: &quot;All My Sons.&quot; Arthur Miller fans, take notice. &quot;American Playhouse&quot; opens its sixth season with this nifty production of Mr. Miller's first big success, a 1947 drama about a family's tangled loyalties during and after World War II.    Tuesday, Jan. 20, 9-10:30 p.m. EST, on PBS (10-11:30 p.m. EST on WNET/Thirteen): &quot;The Conservatives.&quot; A production of Blackwell Corp., this documentary traces the intellectual roots of the American conservative movement, follows its social growth and celebrates its political flowering. Included are interviews with Milton Friedman, Clare Booth Luce, William F. Buckley Jr., William A. Rusher, Russell Kirk, Barry Goldwater, President Reagan, Patrick Buchanan, Norman Podhoretz, Jeane Kirkpatrick, Richard Viguerie, Paul Weyrich, Phyllis Schlafly and Arthur Laffer. </TEXT></DOC>
