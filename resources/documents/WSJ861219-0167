To the left of the room's doorway stands the bed where Bogdan Osinski and his wife, Urzula, sleep. A crib for their baby fills the center of the room. Shelves stuffed with toys and dishes cover one wall. Along another, a table and a wardrobe hem in the couch where Bogdan's brother sleeps. And in the corner past Bogdan's bed is a bed for his mother and father.    His father, Zygmunt, is already in it when a visitor arrives one evening. He props himself up on an elbow.    &quot;When the child cries in the night, we all wake up,&quot; he says. &quot;We have thought of moving. I've been told we have no chance.&quot;    &quot;The lists are closed,&quot; says Urzula, feeding the baby at the table. &quot;It's written in the newspapers. The lists are closed.&quot;    Bogdan stops fiddling with the television set on the shelf and sits back on his bed. &quot;The only way any one of us is going to get out of this apartment,&quot; he says, &quot;is in a coffin.&quot;    In a workers' state, theoretically, the state ought to strive to give every worker an apartment. But Zygmunt Osinski, who works in a steel mill, snorts at the idea and flops on his pillow. He and his family know that factories come first in the East Bloc and that every worker must strive to get an apartment from the state.    Parents in Warsaw recently arrived at a sad juncture: Even when they add a baby's name to the waiting list at birth, they can no longer expect the child to have an apartment at age 18. In Cracow, the wait is 25 years. Nearly two million families among Poland's 37 million people lack homes of their own. Children grow up, marry, have more children and live jammed in with their parents until the undertaker clears some space.    Housing is a touchy problem in Poland. Housing construction leads the Communist Party's tally of &quot;urgent social tasks,&quot; ahead of food growing, health care and education. But, as Poland's leader, Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski, recently acknowledged, &quot;delays in housing construction are deepening.&quot;    The state's failure to house so many of its people calls its &quot;legitimacy&quot; into question, a Western diplomat maintains. A senior town planner, Juliusz Gorynski, calls the shortage &quot;explosive&quot; at a time when the country is going through a new baby boom. The young skip the melodrama. They're just disgusted.    One young woman complains that she had to wait for her mother-in-law to die before inheriting a decent apartment. &quot;They always say it's because of the war,&quot; she says. &quot;For heaven's sake, a whole generation has grown up since then. It's 40 years since the war.&quot;    But it was a bad war. Hitler destroyed 40% of Poland's homes, 80% of them in Warsaw. Survivors lived in the ruins. In the 1950s, the state set itself the goal of giving every citizen a place to live. But the demands of industry and agriculture always came first, and housing lagged behind. By the 1970s, the state had just about given up.    Subsidized cooperatives took over. Members were expected to invest, build and move in. &quot;That's how it should work,&quot; says Andrzej Kuper of the Cooperatives Union. &quot;But we have a gap.&quot;    In 1978, at the height of its profligate borrowing, Poland built 300,000 apartments. Last year, it managed 190,000. But it needs 400,000 a year just to begin shrinking the waiting lists. Meanwhile, millions of people have tied up their savings in deposits on co-ops that they may not live in for decades.    Of all the people who get blamed for Poland's housing calamity, Marian Weglarz usually comes first. &quot;The papers printed a cartoon of me in a courtroom, wearing handcuffs,&quot; says Mr. Weglarz, the head of the Building Research Institute. &quot;I was contaminated by prefabrication.&quot;    Taking his technical advice, Poland went whole-hog into concrete prefab apartment houses in the 1970s. It scrapped many of its brick kilns and built 100 factories capable of turning out enough concrete slabs to assemble the walls of 200,000 apartments a year. All the factories needed was cement.    But now cement is short. Production dropped to 15 million tons last year from 22 million in 1978, reducing output at the prefab factories to 60% of capacity. Cement is short because Polish cement plants use too much energy, and energy is short. Energy is short because coal is short. And coal is short because Poland ships it overseas to repay the debt it racked up to build, among other things, new apartments.    The government blames its debt crisis on Solidarity, the outlawed independent trade union, and on Western governments, notably the U.S. But some Polish officials blame the housing crisis on the government.    &quot;Housing should have priority, not only in politics but in the economy,&quot; says Cooperatives Union Vice President Ryszard Jajszczyk. &quot;The importance of living standards is not recognized. The worker who doesn't have a certain living standard doesn't work.&quot;    Except at finding a better place to live. This requires wile -- and cash. Polish law, for example, outlaws second homes. But the Poles have a saying: &quot;The law is made to be avoided.&quot; So couples with two apartments have been known to get divorced and rent out their extra place for a huge amount on the black market.    Poland does have a legal housing market of sorts. Space-starved families can search out people living alone and propose a swap. &quot;The only illegal part of this transaction is the money,&quot; says a woman negotiating secretly for a swap involving cash. &quot;Everything else is legal.&quot;    The government also countenances private building, to the tune of more than 50,000 houses last year. But building a private house is agony. Materials are scarce in the private sector. Would-be builders have to buy from peddlers who swipe everything from public-housing sites -- making materials even scarcer in the public sector.    &quot;Theoretically, the authorities give you a paper, and you go from store to store to get what you need,&quot; says a man in the throes of building a house. &quot;It's very good if you aren't in a hurry.&quot;    But he is in a hurry and in no mood to wait, so he is using the clandestine suppliers. &quot;One guy sells you bricks and cement, another steel, the next wood,&quot; he says. &quot;Do I have problems finding doors? The answer is no. I have problems finding money. All I have left is the hair on my head.&quot;    Building a house can take 10 years and untold expense. Most Poles can't afford it. Though rent swallows a chunk of their earnings, it isn't onerous. So they stay where they are and wait.    &quot;It was built at the end of the century,&quot; Kristina Maciejko says, showing a guest around the apartment she shares with her two grown sons, her daughter, her daughter's husband and their two sons. &quot;It had an elevator and a carpet on the stairs,&quot; she says. &quot;Can you imagine such luxury?&quot;    By modern standards, the Maciejkos' place is huge. It has four bedrooms. But now the balconies have fallen off the facade. The stairs are bare stone, the hallways dingy and dim. The windows are boarded up, and the chinks are stuffed with rags. In the apartment's bathroom and kitchen, the ceilings have come down, exposing ancient, corroded pipes.    &quot;This building is to be renovated,&quot; Krzysztof Maciejko says as he sits sipping tea with his family. &quot;And this renovation will never take place. One beautiful day, everything will fall on our heads.&quot;    The Maciejkos moved into their apartment in 1971 and have tried ever since to move out. Krzysztof, a 40-year-old engineer, took a job three years ago in a distant suburb of Warsaw; the manager assured him that a new apartment went with it.    &quot;But I'm still here,&quot; Krzysztof says, getting up to fuss with the heater under the dining-room window. &quot;I commute every day. I complained and found that 15 people are in the same position.&quot;    His sister, Kataizyna, illegally rented a one-room apartment with her husband, Andrej Kowalczyk, and their sons. A snapshot of it shows a clot of furniture with laundry strung from corner to corner above. In a year, they gave up, moved back and took up where they had left off, waiting for a co-op.    Mrs. Kowalczyk, a film editor, has been a co-op member since 1973, but construction stopped on her building in 1982. If the building is ever finished, Mrs. Kowalczyk and her husband will have to pay extra to move in; prices have gone up in 13 years.    &quot;For us, this amount is out of reach,&quot; she says. &quot;But in our socialist system to have an apartment is such great luck, such great happiness, that I would go to my friends and try to borrow.&quot;    Great luck? Great happiness? Great leaks and great cracks are more like it. The prefabs Poland rushed to put together have wasted no time falling apart. In a typical, three-year-old building, the elevator has conked out, and water has softened and seamed a wall in the central core. While a workman was installing tiles in one of the bathrooms, the ceiling collapsed on him.    And the rooms are cold. It takes six tons of coal to heat each apartment in a Polish prefab, and all the apartments are cold anyway. Somebody forgot about insulation. Now that the country has awakened to the energy crisis, an emergency drive has begun to stick plastic-foam sheets to the outer walls of 10,000 buildings. This will save coal and set the new-construction effort back even further.    Of all the ranks of grim-gray apartment blocks that ring Poland's cities, Ursynow ranks among the grimmest. A model city designed for 150,000 people, it stands miles from the center of Warsaw; so far, 130,000 people live there, still without benefit of the subway that was meant to take them to work.    Ursynow was supposed to have schools, stores and movie theaters. But the apartments are going in first. The rest is mostly shelved.    &quot;My designs include shops and services,&quot; says Jerzy Nowakowski, one of Ursynow's architects. &quot;Because of the crisis, my designs are ignored. Houses should at least have some color. As you can see, everything is gray. I have no influence on construction. You must ask the construction company.&quot;    The Combine of Warsaw South-District Construction is building Ursynow. Pictures of workers maneuvering prefab slabs adorn the halls of its offices nearby. Early one morning, Director Kazimierz Romanski sits at his telephone-filled desk enjoying a brandy. It is &quot;Housing Construction Workers' Day&quot; in the workers' state.    Mr. Romanski talks about doorknob shortages and the pilfering of hand tools. But he lays much of the blame for the housing mess on Poland's theoretical rulers. &quot;My main problem,&quot; he says, &quot;is the workers.&quot;    In the past decade, half of them have quit, either to retire or to build private houses. Youngsters in the city don't want to work in construction, so Mr. Romanski has to hire in the country. His workers have to commute long distances. They arrive late. They leave early.    Why don't they live in Ursynow, near the construction site?    Mr. Romanski swirls his brandy and drinks it down. &quot;There is a shortage of apartments,&quot; he says. </TEXT></DOC>
