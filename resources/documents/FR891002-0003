As stated in the first section of theFinancial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989, twoof the principal purposes of that Act are ``[t]o establish a new corporation,to be known as the Resolution Trust Corporation, to contain, manage, andresolve failed savings associations'' and ``[t]o provide funds from publicand private sources to deal expeditiously with failed depository institutions.''Thus, the expeditious resolution of failed savings associations (thriftinstitutions) is a fundamental objective of that Act. Funding has beenmade available for these resolutions and it is imperative that the FDIC,as manager of the Resolution Trust Corporation, the agency charged withmanaging and resolving thrift failures, proceed expeditiously to arrangeand complete resolutions, some of which will necessarily involve conversiontransactions and therefore require the payment of entrance fees. The longerthese defaulting institutions go unresolved, the greater the cost to theAmerican taxpayers. Therefore, it is in the public interest to expedite,not delay, these thrift resolutions. Similarly, although perhaps not asurgent a matter as resolving failed thrifts, numerous transactions arepending which involve the sale of savings association branches to banks.These transactions, many of which are awaiting or have already receivedregulatory approval, cannot be completed until any applicable fees calledfor by the new legislation have been set.For these reasons, the FDIC Board of Directors has determined that thenotice and public participation that are ordinarily required by the AdministrativeProcedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553) before a regulation may take effect would,in this case, be contrary to the public interest and that good cause existsfor waiving the customary 30-day delayed effective date. Nevertheless,the Board desires to have the benefit of public comment before adoptionof a final rule on this subject, and so invites interested persons to submitcomments during a 60-day comment period. In adopting a final regulation,the Board will make such revisions in the interim rule as may be appropriatebased on the comments received.<ITAG tagnum="84">Background and Discussion</ITAG>Section 206(a)(7) of the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and EnforcementAct of 1989 (``FIRRE Act'' or ``FIRREA'') adds a new subsection 5(d) tothe Federal Deposit Insurance Act (``FDIC Act'') that, among other things,authorizes the FDIC to assess insurance fees in two situations. First,FIRREA provides that any institution that becomes insured by the FDIC,and any noninsured branch of a foreign bank that becomes insured by theFDIC, shall pay the FDIC ``any fee which the [FDIC] may by regulation prescribe,* * *'' This entrance fee is to be prescribed ``after giving due considerationto the need to establish and maintain reserve ratios in the Bank InsuranceFund [(``BIF'')] and the Savings Association Insurance Fund [(``SAIF'')]as required by section 7 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act.'' The entrancefee is to be paid into the appropriate fund (<T3>i.e.</T3>, into BIF if the depository institution becomes a ``BIF member''and into SAIF if the depository institution becomes a ``SAIF member'').Generally speaking, any savings association (<T3>e.g.</T3>, a savings and loan) other than a Federal savings bank charteredunder section 5(o) of the Home Owners Loan Act is a member of SAIF, andany bank is a member of BIF. Savings associations that were insured bythe Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation (``FSLIC'') on August8, 1989, the day before the date of enactment of FIRREA, and thereby became``automatically'' insured by the FDIC by operation of law, do not haveto pay an entrance fee as a result of their transfer from FSLIC to SAIF.Second, FIRREA requires the FDIC to prescribe, by regulation, proceduresfor assessing entrance and exit fees for insured depository institutionsthat participate in ``conversion transactions.'' Generally speaking, aconversion transaction is defined to include a change of status (by charterconversion or otherwise) from a SAIF member to a BIF member or vice versa;the merger or consolidation of a SAIF member with a BIF member; the assumptionof deposit liabilities of a SAIF member by a BIF member, or vice versa;and the transfer of assets in consideration of such a deposit assumption.Under FIRREA, there is a five-year moratorium on conversion transactions,with limited exceptions for (1) Conversion transactions that affect aninsubstantial portion of the total deposits of each participating institution,and (2) certain conversions involving institutions in default or in dangerof default. The FDIC must approve any such excepted conversion.The first exception is intended to exempt from the moratorium, subjectto FDIC approval, branch sales and other transfers of deposits betweendepository institutions that are members of different insurance funds (SAIFor BIF) and which are regarded as insubstantial when measured against thetotal deposits of each participating institution. For example, this exceptionwould cover the sale of a branch or branches of an insured savings andloan association (a SAIF member), to an insured bank (a BIF member), wherethe volume of deposits being transferred meets the insubstantiality testprescribed in the statute.The second exception covers conversions that occur as part of an acquisitionof an insured depository institution in default or in danger of default,if the FDIC determines that the estimated financial benefits to the fundthe institution is leaving (or the Resolution Trust Corporation (``RTC''),if the institution is a savings association) equal or exceed the FDIC'sestimate of loss of assessment income to that fund during the years remainingin the moratorium period, and (in the case of a savings association) ifthe RTC concurs in the FDIC's determination. This exception is intendedto permit conversion transactions to occur as a means of resolving savingsassociation (thrift institution) and bank failures, notwithstanding themoratorium, if the requisite findings can be made.Paragraph 5(d)(2)(E) of the FDI Act, as added by the FIRRE Act, requires,among other things, that each insured depository institution participatingin a conversion transaction pay an entrance fee in an amount to be determinedby the FDIC. The fee is to be in the ``approximate amount which the [FDIC]calculates as necessary to prevent dilution'' of the fund (BIF or SAIF)of which the resulting or acquiring depository institution is a member(in other words, the fund being entered), and is to be paid to that fund.Thus, for example, where a thrift failure is resolved by an insured bank(BIF member) acquiring assets from and assuming deposit liabilities ofthe failed savings association (SAIF member), the entrance fee would beset at the approximate amount which the FDIC calculates is necessary toprevent dilution of BIF. Similarly, where an insured bank assumes depositliabilities from an insured savings association through the sale of branches(and assuming the FDIC has approved this conversion transaction), the entrancefee would be the approximate amount necessary to offset the dilution ofBIF that would result from the transfer of those deposits from SAIF insuranceto BIF insurance.The FDIC is also authorized to prescribe procedures for charging exit feesto insured depository institutions that participate in conversion transactions.For transactions in which the resulting or acquiring institution is a BIFmember, any such exit fee is to be paid into SAIF (or to the FinancingCorporation, if the Secretary of the Treasury so orders after determiningthat the Financing Corporation has exhausted all other sources of fundingfor interest payments on its obligations). For ``SAIF-to-BIF'' conversiontransactions consummated before January 1, 1997, the FDIC and the Secretaryof the Treasury jointly determine the amount of any exit fee; for thoseconsummated after that date, the FDIC alone determines the amount.FIRREA expressly provides that the conversion of a SAIF member savingsassociation to a bank charter is not considered to be a ``conversion transaction''if the bank elects to remain a SAIF member and thereby continues to payassessments to SAIF. In such situations, no entrance or exit fees wouldbe required unless and until, following expiration of the moratorium, thebank switches from SAIF to BIF insurance.Also the merger of a SAIF member savings association into a BIF memberbank is permitted, notwithstanding the moratorium, if the bank is a subsidiaryof a bank holding company that controls the savings association. The Boardof Governors of the Federal Reserve System, as well as the appropriateFederal banking agency (as defined in the Federal Deposit Insurance Act),would have to approve the transaction. The resulting or acquiring bankwould have to continue to pay assessments to SAIF on that portion of itsdeposits that are attributable to the former savings associations, undera formula prescribed in FIRREA which includes a seven percent adjustmentfor growth. The payment of assessments to SAIF could be discontinued if,after the five-year moratorium period expires, the FDIC approves an applicationby the bank to treat the merger transaction as a conversion transactionand the bank pays any entrance and exit fees prescribed by the FDIC.By means of this interim rule, the FDIC is not attempting to prescribeall the fees authorized or called for by FIRREA. Rather, at this time theFDIC is only setting entrance fees for ``SAIF-to-BIF'' conversion transactions.Pending a decision on exit fees, this action will enable potential participantsin thrift resolutions arranged by the RTC, branch sales, and other permittedconversion transactions to begin evaluating the costs of those transactions.As required by FIRREA, the amount of any exit fee must be jointly determinedby the FDIC and the Secretary of the Treasury. The FDIC is working withthe Treasury Department to determine the amount of any exit fee to be imposedfor conversion transactions. A decision is expected soon and most likelywill be the subject of another interim rule in the very near future. ``BIF-to-SAIF''conversions are expected to be rare and therefore are not being addressedat this time; however, the FDIC expects to address fees for BIF-to-SAIFconversions expeditiously. In addition, entrance fees for ``uninsured institutions''(<T3>de novo</T3> depository institutions or operating noninsured institutionsseeking FDIC insurance) are not being addressed at this time, but may bethe subject of a rulemaking proceeding at a future date.For purposes of the interim rule, the FDIC has determined to set the entrancefee for SAIF-to-BIF conversions at the product of the ``reserve ratio''of the fund being entered (<T3>i.e.</T3>, BIF) multiplied by the ``deposit base'' being transferredfrom SAIF to BIF insurance. The reserve ratio is defined as the ratio ofthe net worth of the fund to the value of the aggregate estimated insureddeposits held in all members of that fund. In computing the entrance feefor a particular conversion transaction, the reserve ratio used would bethe most recent publicly available reserve ratio (as of the date of transfer)computed by the FDIC on the basis of its most recent audited year-end financialstatements. The most recent publicly available reserve ratio may be obtainedby contacting the FDIC's Office of Corporate Communications. (As of thiswriting, the BIF reserve ratio for purposes of computing the entrance feewould be .80 percent, and is based on the FDIC's audited year-end 1988financial statements. This ratio would be used for purposes of calculatingthe entrance fee until a new figure has been announced based on the FDIC'saudited year-end 1989 financial statements.)The deposit base against which the reserve ratio is to be applied woulddepend upon the type of transaction involved. For ``non-resolution'' conversiontransactions, such as branch sales involving the assumption of depositliabilities of a ``healthy'' operating thrift by an insured bank, the appropriatedeposit base would be the total dollar amount of the deposits being transferredfrom SAIF to BIF insurance, measured as of the date of transfer. However,in ``resolution'' cases (<T3>i.e.</T3>, where the conversion transaction is one which is being arrangedby the RTC to dispose of or otherwise deal with an insured savings associationin default or in danger of default (including any insured savings associationin conservatorship)); a certain amount of deposit ``run-off'' can be expectedto occur following the transaction, and so the dilutive effect of the transactionon BIF may be prevented by charging an entrance fee only against thosedeposits likely to be retained by the acquiring bank. Thus, the interimrule permits the use of an estimated ``retained deposit base'' in determiningthe appropriate entrance fee for transactions arranged. The dollar amountof the retained deposit base would be estimated by the FDIC on a case-by-casebasis at the time RTC prepares the ``bid package'' for the particular thriftresolution in question, and the intitial estimate would be announced toprospective bidders at the time proposals for acquistion are solicited;however, the FDIC may adjust its estimate of the retained deposit baseas necessary over the course of the bidding process.The rationale for using an estimated retained deposit base in computingthe entrance fee for RTC-arranged conversion transactions is more fullyexplained as follows:The assumption of all or a portion of a SAIF member's deposit liabilitiesby a BIF member results in greater potential liabilities for BIF. The extentto which potential BIF liabilities increase is dependent upon the proportionof transferred deposits that remain in the BIF institution following thetransaction. The proportion of transferred accounts remaining with theacquirer will be dependent upon such factors as the degree of change incustomer service, convenience, and the rate of interest paid on accounts.For example, ``brokered'' deposits, which typically pay interest ratesthat are significantly higher than the prevailing rates available in adepository institution's normal market area, are not likely to remain withthe acquirer if rates are reduced. Depositors not satisfied with the newinstitution for one reason or another may redeposit funds with other BIFmembers, SAIF members, or neither.Taking these factors into consideration, entrance fees should be chargedagainst the level of deposits expected to remain at the acquiring bankfollowing the transaction. Therefore, the deposit base against which entrancefees should be charged should consist of those deposit accounts which theFDIC estimates to have a high probability of remaining with the acquirerfollowing the transaction. This necessarily requires estimating the retaineddeposit base on a case-by-case basis for each failed institution, sinceeach may have a different impact on customer relationships. The estimatedretained deposit base would be specified by the FDIC in the solicitationand evaluation of bids for failed institutions.On the other hand, in the case of branch sales involving the assumptionof deposit liabilities of an operating thrift by an insured bank, the participatinginstitutions can and do negotiate as to which deposits are to be transferred.As a result, there is an expectation that deposits contracted for are likelyto remain in the acquiring bank or, if not, the purchase price can be adjustedto reflect the value of the deposits being acquired. Thus, using totaldeposits assumed (and not just estimated retained deposits) as the depositbase for purposes of computing the entrance fee makes sense for non-resolutionconversion transactions.Regardless of the kind of transaction involved, the transfer of depositsfrom SAIF to BIF necessarily increases potential BIF liabilities withouta commensurate increase in insurance reserves (<T3>ie.,</T3> dilutes the entered insurance fund). As directed by FIRREA,the FDIC is to determine the approximate amount by which BIF reserves needto increase to prevent dilution of the insurance fund in conversion transactions.If, for example, the ratio of insurance reserves to insured deposits is.80 percent, dilution would be prevented by charging a fee equal to .80percent of transferred deposits.FIRREA requires that the entrance fee for any SAIF-to-BIF conversion transactionto be paid into BIF. Under the interim rule, the resulting or acquiringinstitution would be liable for payment of the entrance fee; however, ina two-party transaction, the two institutions may agree to divide the paymentand may arrange among themselves who is to pay what share. So long as theentire fee is paid, the FDIC will accept payment from either party; if,however, some or all of the fee is not paid, the FDIC will look to theresulting or acquiring institution for payment. In other words, the FDICwill seek to enforce the obligation of the resulting or acquiring institutionto pay the entire amount of the entrance fee, leaving that institutionto enforce any contractual or other arrangements it may have made withany other participating institution.All fees are due and payable on the resulting or acquiring institution'sfirst regular semiannual assessment date (<T3>i.e., </T3>the date on which it is required under section 7(c) of theFederal Deposit Insurance Act, 12 U.S.C. 1817(c), to pay its regular semiannualassessment to the FDIC) following the expiration of 30 days from the datethe deposits are transferred from SAIF to BIF insurance. (Ordinarily, aninstitution's semiannual assessments are payable on or before January 31and July 31 of each year.) However, the interim rule permits the resultingor acquiring institution, at its option, and with the consent of the FDIC,to pay the entrance fee in equal annual installments over a period of notmore than five years, interest-free, with the first installment due onthe date described in the preceding sentence.Setting the entrance fee for conversion transactions at this time by meansof an interim rule will provide a measure of certainty for those banksthat seek to acquire troubled savings associations from the RTC or thosethat seek to acquire branches of operating thrifts. Since potential acquirersand investors need to know with some degree of precision what the costsof acquisition will be, the FDIC has determined that if, following thepublic comment period, the final regulation prescribes an entrance feethat would be greater than the entrance fee prescribed in the interim rule,a bank that participated in a conversion transaction during the periodthe interim rule was in effect will not have to pay the higher amount;if the entrance fee prescribed in the final regulation is less than thefee prescribed in the interim rule, the difference will be refunded tothe bank or, if the fee is being paid in installments, the amount of eachinstallment will be adjusted accordingly. Thus, banks that participatein transactions in reliance on the interim rule will not suffer any subsequentincrease in the entrance fee, nor will they miss out on any subsequentdecrease, that results from consideration of public comment on this issue.<ITAG tagnum="84">Request for Public Comment</ITAG>The FDIC is issuing this interim rule in response to the urgent need topermit certain conversion transactions to go forward without delay. However,the FDIC desires, and is hereby requesting, comment on all aspects of theinterim rule. In addition, the FDIC invites comment on the following specificissues:1. Entrance fees are intended to prevent dilution of the insurance fundbeing entered. The measure of insurance fund adequacy used in this interimrule is the ratio of fund reserves to insured deposits. In practice, however,failing bank resolutions have often had the effect of protecting all depositors,including those with deposits beyond the insured deposit limits (presently$100,000). Some might argue, therefore, that because the FDIC can achieve100 percent deposit insurance coverage, the appropriate fund adequacy measureshould be the ratio of reserves to total deposits. Total deposits includeall domestic and foreign deposits regardless of the amount held in theaccount. Therefore, should the appropriate entrance fee be based on theratio of reserves to total deposits?2. The interim rule uses the concept of an estimated ``retained depositbase'' against which entrance fees will be charged in connection with RTC-arrangedconversion transactions. The retained deposit base would include only thosetransferred deposits that are thought likely to remain in the acquiringbank for some period beyond the date of transfer. Is this an appropriateway to measure the dilutive effect of the transaction on BIF? What othermethods could be used to accomplish the same goal?3. In estimating the retained deposit base, the FDIC is ultimately concernedwith the potential increase in FDIC liabilities associated with a conversiontransaction. What factors should the FDIC consider in evaluating the likelihoodof transferred deposits remaining with the acquiring BIF member Bank? Howmight this regulation affect the types of bids submitted by potential acquirersof failed institutions?4. The entrance fee is to be based on the most recent publicly availablereserve-to-insured-deposit ratio computed by the FDIC on the basis of itsmost recent audited year-end financial statements. Thus, for purposes ofthe interim rule, the reserve ratio will be recomputed only once a year.Should the reserve ratio be computed more frequently for this purpose basedon unaudited data or, given the potential fluctuations in the reserve ratioover time, would an annual average reserve ratio be more appropriate?5. The interim rule permits institutions to pay the entrance fee over afive-year period, interest-free. Should immediate payment be required?If payment over time is permitted, how long should the payment period be?Should interest be charged? If so, at what rate?<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 12 CFR Part 312</ITAG>Assessments, Bank deposit insurance, Banks, banking, Savings and loan associations,Savings associations.For the reasons set out in the preamble, a new part 312 is added to title12, chapter III, subchapter A of the Code of Federal Regulations as follows:<ITAG tagnum="56">PART 312_ASSESSMENT OF FEES UPON ENTRANCE TO OR EXIT FROM THE BANKINSURANCE FUND OR THE SAVINGS ASSOCIATION INSURANCE FUND</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="70">Sec.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">312.1 Definitions.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">312.2 Bank Insurance Fund reserve ratio.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">312.3 [Reserved]</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">312.4 Entrance fees assessed in connection with conversion transactions.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority:</T4> Pub.
