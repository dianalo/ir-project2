Gottlieb, president of Alfred A. Knopf Inc., was named editor of New Yorker magazine, succeeding William Shawn.    Mr. Gottlieb, 55 years old, is highly regarded for his work at Knopf and had been rumored to be a candidate. But he wasn't considered a front-runner because he didn't work for the magazine, said one longtime New Yorker editor. The editor said New Yorker staff members were &quot;shocked and surprised&quot; by the appointment, which takes effect March 1.    In an interview late last night, Mr. Gottlieb said he is &quot;anticipating a lot of hard work&quot; at his new job, his first outside the book publishing industry. While declining to comment on staff reaction to his appointment, he said of Mr. Shawn's pending resignation: &quot;Everyone will be distressed (that Mr. Shawn) is leaving. I'm distressed he is leaving.&quot; The search for a successor to Mr. Shawn has been under way for some time.    The New Yorker is owned by the Newhouse family's Advance Publications Inc., a closely held company that also owns Knopf.    Mr. Shawn, who couldn't be reached for comment last night, also strongly objected to Mr. Gottlieb's appointment but was told yesterday by S.I. Newhouse, who is in charge of the family's magazine holding, that the company had decided to go outside the magazine to choose his successor, said the editor, who asked not to be identified.    Mr. Shawn, 79, is only the second editor in the magazine's 62-year history. He became editor in 1951, succeeding founding editor, Harold Ross. </TEXT></DOC>
