NutraSweet's move underscores the company's mounting senseof urgency about getting its much-hyped artificial fat intothe marketplace in as many products as possible. Announced inearly 1988, Simplesse's huge lead was frittered away by aseries of regulatory and marketing snafus. Those problemsenabled a host of rival fake fats to overtake NutraSweet'sinvention that promised all the taste of real fat with almostnone of the calories.</LP><TEXT>   The original Simplesse, made from a combination of milkprotein and egg whites, has received FDA approval only infrozen desserts; a petition for its use in other applicationsis still pending. The new formulation, which NutraSweetdescribes as a &quot;breakthrough,&quot; is made from whey proteinconcentrate, an ingredient that has been on the FDA'sso-called GRAS list of ingredients &quot;generally recognized assafe&quot; since 1981.   George Pauli, chief of the FDA's novel ingredients andpolicy development branch, confirmed that the new form ofSimplesse has the agency's approval and said NutraSweet is&quot;on solid ground as long as they stay within the terms of thewhey protein concentrate regulation.&quot;   With its latest Simplesse concoction, NutraSweet isessentially going back to the future. The company's initialmarketing plans called for introducing Simplesse made fromwhey protein concentrate. But former company executives saythat days before Simplesse was announced with great fanfareon Jan. 27, 1988, David Morley, who presided over theSimplesse project, made a last-minute decision to switch theformulation: Scientists couldn't figure out how to mask thedistinctive taste of whey in Simple Pleasures, NutraSweet'sersatz ice cream. &quot;They are going back to ground zero -- tothe very original formulation,&quot; said one ex-NutraSweetmanager.   NutraSweet, a unit of Monsanto Co., claims its newSimplesse is better able to withstand high temperature. Italso provides taste advantages in such applications as cheeseand butter and has &quot;significant&quot; cost advantages. &quot;This isthe most versatile form of Simplesse,&quot; a NutraSweet spokesmansaid.   Even so, the Deerfield, Ill., company said it intends tocontinue selling original Simplesse, which it views asparticularly well-suited to frozen dessert and mayonnaiseproducts.   Although a number of food industry executives andconsultants said the shift to whey protein concentratebolsters Simplesse's position, they remain skeptical that thereformulation will salvage the ingredient's fortunes.   &quot;This is a help but not a breakthrough -- this is not themagic bullet as much as NutraSweet would love that to be thecase,&quot; said Robert Gillespie, president of CPCInternational's Best Foods division. &quot;Whey protein is moreheat-resistant, but it is still going to leave Simplesse asone of a range of ingredients that can be used singly or incombination to replace fat.&quot;   Some industry experts also question whether NutraSweetwill be able to overcome the credibility problem thatSimplesse developed after failing to meet the greatexpectations of manufacturers and consumers. That task willbe especially difficult, they say, because a number of highperformance fat substitutes have recently come onto themarket. These include Stellar, made by Tate andamp; Lyle PLC's A.E.Staley Manufacturing Co. unit, and Pfizer Inc.'s Litesse.   &quot;NutraSweet is coming back into a more crowded fatreplacement field which has recently seen the introduction ofsome extremely high performance products,&quot; said David Braff,president of Braff andamp; Co., a New York marketing firm. &quot;Thequestion is whether Simplesse Two will just be a reprise -- abig announcement that doesn't present the consumer with asignificant difference from the other fat replacers.&quot;   Although food industry executives agree that the successof Simplesse will hinge on getting major food companies toplace big orders, NutraSweet has so far recruited onlyKaukauna Cheese of Little Chute, Wis., to use the newwhey-based Simplesse in its line of light cheeses.   &quot;We were interested in improving the taste of our lightcheeses so we began to investigate the synthetic fatsubstitutes that are or will be available,&quot; said Bob Gilbert,Kaukauna's chief executive. &quot;We concluded that, for ourpurposes, Simplesse delivered the best combination of goodtaste and lowered fat.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
