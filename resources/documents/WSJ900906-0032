How could the group now choose someone so different?   &quot;Oh, we still support Marion Barry,&quot; says white-hairedLucille Savage, as a knot of women nearby nod vigorously.&quot;It's just that he's not running.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   The District of Columbia is electing a mayor this year, afact nearly lost amid the sound and fury surrounding Mr.Barry's arrest and trial. The campaign had begun to attractan unusually large and diverse field even before Mr. Barry'slegal troubles took hold, and the task for whoever wins isimmense: nothing less than a new beginning for a traumatizedcity. Yet with the primary less than a week away, the talkhere remains less about who is in the race than who isn't.   &quot;Barry so dominated the scene here, it doesn't take arocket scientist to say there's a vacuum,&quot; says Mark Plotkin,a one-time local Democratic activist who is now the politicaleditor of a radio station. Adds Ron Lester, a pollster whosefirm has worked for Mr. Barry in the past: &quot;The public'sattention has basically been frozen on the trial.&quot;   Behind that wall of seeming indifference brews the firstmajor realignment in the city's political leadership sinceMr. Barry's election a dozen years ago. The two mostimportant citywide officials after the mayor -- the citycouncil chairman and the district's nonvoting delegate toCongress -- both abandoned their posts to enter theDemocratic mayoral primary.   The winner's first task may be to heal the divisions ofrace, gender and even class stirred by Mr. Barry's arrest andtrial. In a city that is nearly three-quarters black, Mr.Barry's charges that he was set up as part of a federalcampaign of harassment of black elected officials resonatewith many voters. If anything, his conviction on a singlemisdemeanor cocaine-possession charge -- after the governmentexpended vast resources in a fruitless effort to nail him onfelony charges -- may have buttressed his arguments; themayor is now running for a seat on the city council.   The Barry trial also brought to the fore residents'long-simmering resentment over the city's &quot;last colony&quot;status, symbolized most recently by Congress's refusal to letit use its own local tax money to pay for abortions for poorwomen. And it has even stirred a debate in some quarters hereover the appropriate role of black women in the community;the former girlfriend who cooperated with authorities in themayor's trial has become a target of abuse, unlike the twoother former girlfriends who went to jail rather than testifyagainst him.   Stepping into this potentially volatile mix are the fiveDemocrats competing to replace Mr. Barry, four of them blackand two of them women. In addition, there is an unaccustomedchallenge from the district's tiny Republican Party, whichthis year has a potentially strong candidate in former PoliceChief Maurice Turner.   Currently leading, according to local polls, is CouncilmanJohn Ray, a 47-year-old lawyer whose stolid, uncharismaticpersonal style masks a poignant personal history. Born andraised in a turpentine camp in rural Georgia, Mr. Ray neverknew his father and was reared by grandparents who couldn'tread. He was able to obtain a higher education after servingin the Air Force, and he clerked for the late Supreme CourtJustice Abe Fortas. An 11-year city council veteran, he hasportrayed himself as the city's &quot;best hope,&quot; and hisliterature touts him as &quot;a role model for our youth.&quot;   Political analysts say Mr. Ray's lead -- polls indicate hehas the support of about a third of the voters as well asleading in endorsements and fund-raising -- has occurred sofar mainly because he has alienated the fewest voters. &quot;Hissupport is not strong, but it's broad,&quot; says Mr. Lester, thepollster. Mr. Ray's opponents have sought to damage him byhammering at his numerous contributions from developers andreal-estate interests, which account for about a third of his$900,000 war chest.   Closest to Mr. Ray in the polls has been Charlene DrewJarvis, who, like the other woman candidate, Sharon PrattDixon, comes from a distinguished Washington family. Ms.Jarvis is the daughter of the late Charles Drew, who inventeda method for developing blood plasma. Holder of a doctoratein neuropsychology, the 49-year-old Ms. Jarvis abandoned apromising career in science to enter politics and now has areputation as a tough infighter whose skills rival those ofMr. Barry.   But like Mr. Barry, she has suffered from unsavoryconnections: A one-time social companion and campaign managerreceived thousands of dollars in consulting fees from anational bank seeking a foothold here at a time when Ms.Jarvis had significant influence over the banking community.She now calls the association a mistake.   The remaining three candidates are closely grouped,trailing Mr. Ray and Ms. Jarvis in polls but still withinstriking distance. Of them, the most puzzling is WalterFauntroy, at 57 the oldest candidate and the early favoritein the race because of his 19 years as the district'snonvoting representative to Congress.   Mr. Fauntroy says he entered the race out of disgust atthe ineptitude of local officials. In a recent televiseddebate, he compared himself to a star football player,saying, &quot;Here I am clearing holes in the line on CapitolHill, making it possible for them to get millions of dollars,and they are fumbling the ball in the background. . . . WhatI'm saying is, give me the ball now.&quot;   But his candidacy has faltered on charges ofineffectiveness in Congress and on a backlash against hissharp attacks on Mr. Ray, including his suggestion that localreal-estate interests -- which are white-dominated -- &quot;own&quot;Mr. Ray.   If Mr. Fauntroy's star has dimmed, the hot candidate ofthe moment may be Ms. Dixon. Daughter of a judge and formerwife of a council chairman, she has never held electiveoffice. But the 46-year-old lawyer, former DemocraticNational Committee official and utility-company executive hasbecome the rising star in the race, having won the surpriseendorsement of the powerful Washington Post.   The Post applauded her stance as the first and onlycandidate to call for Mr. Barry's resignation; the paper alsolauded her detailed plans to stabilize the city'sdeteriorating financial condition. But her very willingnessto tackle tough fiscal issues may work against her. One ofher plans, for instance, is to trim the city's payroll bylaying off at least 2,000 workers. But that is just the sortof thing that sends chills down the spine of the city's48,000 employees -- an extraordinary number in a city of onlyabout 600,000 residents.   Ms. Dixon, like Ms. Jarvis, may also suffer because of hergender. She says she has been surprised by the number ofvoters who have told her the city needs &quot;a black male rolemodel&quot; after the trauma of Mr. Barry's trial; a WashingtonPost poll indicated that more than 20% of voters feel thatthe mayor should be a man.   But the person facing the most resistance in the race isprobably the lone white candidate, City Council ChairmanDavid Clarke. The 46-year-old lawyer is often criticized fora volcanic temper, but more damaging are poll findings thatnearly half of the city's voters, black and white alike,believe the next mayor should be black.   Mr. Clarke has been closely identified with black issuesand concerns -- he briefly attended the same seminary asMartin Luther King Jr. and received his law degree frompredominately black Howard University. But few observers givehim much of a chance in the current charged atmosphere. Mr.Clarke himself, asked about the racial issue at a recentcandidates' forum, responded: &quot;God made me white. There'snothing I can do about that.&quot;   ---   `How important is it that the next District mayor be ablack person?'
