(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Oldsmobile is setting its marketingsights on younger consumers for the coming automobile model year,with an advertising campaign saying, ``This is not your father'sOldsmobile.''   The General Motors Corp. division introduced its 1989 cars at anews conference Thursday, with executives constantly pointing tothe 35- to 45-year-old consumer as being in the bull's eye of Olds'marketing target.   In the past, said Warren Christell, Oldsmobile's generalmarketing manager, the average Oldsmobile buyer has been about 50years old.   To introduce the '89 models to the public, Oldsmobile onThursday previewed a series of television ads to begin runningduring the Summer Olympics, which begin next week in Seoul, SouthKorea.   Among the people in the advertisements are Deborah Moore and herfather, actor Roger Moore of James Bond movie fame; Melanie Shatnerand her father, William Shatner, who starred in the original ``StarTrek'' television series and motion pictures; and Jay Carpenter,son of former astronaut Scott Carpenter.   In each of the ads, a narrator says, ``This is not your father'sOldsmobile.''   ``We want young and old alike to identify with Oldsmbile,'' saidOldsmobile General Manager Williams Lane.   ``We think our products are ahead of our image,'' Christellsaid. ``We haven't done a good job of telling people about it....We think our (advertising) campaigns were on (target for)strategy .. but were weren't communicating with the consumer.''   Along with expanding the target market for 1989, Oldsmobileexecutives stressed the company's focus on new design and advancedtechnology.   One of the technical innovations to be introduced in a limitednumber of 1989 models later in the model year is a ``head updisplay,'' which projects a digital speedometer, turn signalindicators, low-fuel warning and high-beam indicator onto thewindshield. A driver does not have to look away from the road toget the information.   Olds executives said the display system would be offered as anoption on some 1989 Cutlass Supremes.   However, Larry Lyons, general engineering and planning manager,said the company doesn't plan to expand the system quickly intoother cars.   ``We are purposely going slow on that,'' he said.   Another new bit of electronics coming out with some of the '89Oldsmobiles is a color television screen in the dashboard whichwill display a variety of functions, such as heating and stereocontrols and a compass.   That device will be available as an option in Toronados andTrofeos.</TEXT></DOC>
