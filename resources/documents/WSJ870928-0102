The Christian Democratic governor of the state of Schleswig-Holstein, Uwe Barschel, resigned Friday following allegations he had used smear tactics to undercut a rival's campaign in recent elections. The scandal was a blow for Chancellor Helmut Kohl and his coalition government.    As chairman of the Christian Democratic Party in Schleswig-Holstein, Mr. Stoltenberg's immediate task is to hold together a fragile coalition government elected two weeks ago and, most importantly, to prevent new state elections.    On Sept. 13, the Christian Democrats lost the majority they had held in the state legislature. They will be able to retain control through a coalition with the liberal Free Democratic Party; even so, they haven't been able to shake the controversy surrounding their candidate, Mr. Barschel.    The day before the election, the influential news weekly Der Spiegel reported in a cover story that Mr. Barschel had ordered a former press aide to investigate the tax affairs and sex life of the Social Democratic candidate. The aide, Reiner Pfeiffer, claimed Mr. Barschel had instructed him to obtain an electronic listening device and conduct surveillance of the challenger.    Mr. Barschel, who has repeatedly denied Mr. Pfeiffer's allegations, said Friday he was nonetheless resigning because &quot;the fact remains that Pfeiffer committed his acts from the state government's press office. Therefore I assume responsibility, although the acts were carried out without my participation or knowledge,&quot; he said.    Chancellor Kohl has already suffered several election setbacks since his election to a second term in January. Another loss would further weaken his power base and intensify bickering among the coalition partners.    Though it has been speculated that Mr. Stoltenberg might now assume the governorship of Schleswig-Holstein -- a position he held before becoming finance minister in 1982 -- political observers here generally doubt that will happen.    Still, repairing the damage is of such importance that some observers believe he might be induced to return. &quot;If he can't find a satisfactory resolution, it could prove very damaging to him,&quot; said one government source. </TEXT></DOC>
