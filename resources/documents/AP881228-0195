The U.S. government announced Tuesday that beginning Jan. 1 itwill impose $100 million worth of trade sanctions against Europeanfood products in retaliation for a scheduled Common Market ban onimports of U.S. meat that contains growth hormones.   The U.S. action in effect doubles the wholesale price for U.S.consumers for such products as imported hams and canned Italiantomatoes.   European consumer groups have argued that using growth hormones,fed to cattle to increase their bulk, poses a potential human healththreat.   ``Any country and thus the community has the right to takemeasures it judges necessary to protect the health of itsconsumers,'' De Clercq said, ``as long as they are notdiscriminatory.''   The United States contends that the presence of the hormones inmeat is too small to be hazardous and that scientific evidence oftheir threat to health is inconclusive.   Four EEC countries _ West Germany, Italy, the Netherlands andBelgium _ have banned all hormones in cattle breeding for years. TheEEC has banned seven hormones.   Trade between the United States and the European Community totals$150 billion annually. But the sides have been locked in anincreasingly bitter trade dispute.   Faced with the possibility of U.S. sanctions over its hormoneban, the EEC tentatively agreed on Dec. 19 on a list of U.S.products on which it would impose a 100 percent duty if Washingtongoes ahead with its trade sanctions.   This would include U.S. exports of honey, unshelled nuts, driedfruit and canned corn.   ``The European Commission is ready,'' De Clercq told the Belgianradio. ``It has already proposed a list of measures which will haveto be adapted to the announced U.S. measures that are weaker thanpreviously announced. We have to take into account the attenuatedcharacter of these measures.''   EEC officials have lately added another reason for banninghormones. They claim there is already too much meat on the EEC andworld markets, therefore they see no need for boosting productionwith hormones.   Australia, New Zealand, Brazil and Argentina have agreed toexport hormone-free beef to Europe.</TEXT></DOC>
