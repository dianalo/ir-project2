It is shown that geometrical-optical (GO) pictureof OLW propagation is violated when the flow exceeds critical energyvalue, depending, in particular, on the plasma temperature. At energyflows below the critical one GO approximation is just and total conversionof OLW into ''warm'' plasma wave takes place.</TEXT></DOC>
