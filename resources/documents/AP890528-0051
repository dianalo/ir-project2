STEICHEN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   West Germany is becoming increasinglywary of a NATO defense policy that could unleash nuclear weapons onGerman soil despite this front-line nation's strident protests.   The issue goes to the heart of a current dispute within theNorth Atlantic Treaty Organization over whether superpower talksshould be held to reduce short-range nuclear weapons.   The arsenals are deployed on German territory and would be firedthere in the event of war.   West Germany is pressing for early superpower negotiations onthe missiles. The Unites States and Britain oppose such talks untilSoviet conventional superiority is reduced.   Chancellor Helmut Kohl's coalition government is also resistinga joint U.S.-British effort to replace NATO's aging short-rangemissile arsenal in the 1990s with modernized rockets more thantriple the current range.   The missile dispute is also at the core of a growing debate overjust how much say West Germany has in NATO decisions that couldliterally affect its existence.   That debate was fueled after recent leaks about a top-secretNATO exercise allegedly designed to test an Alliance scenerio forusing nuclear weapons in Europe to stop a Soviet-led Warsaw Pactattack.   According to NATO strategy, the short-range weapons are a vitalpart of a defense known as ``flexible response,'' or the threatthat NATO could use nuclear weapons along with conventional forcesto stop a Soviet attack.   The leftist-leaning news magazine Der Spiegel, quoting anonymoussources, said the exercise, dubbed Wintex 89, demonstrated thepotential powerlessness of non-nuclear NATO powers in preventingthe use of the weapons.   The magazine said the West German and Turkish participants inthe exercise pulled out after NATO officials, led by U.S. officers,ordered a theoretical atomic strike that would have destroyed largeparts of West and East Germany, Turkey and the western territoriesof Poland and Czechoslovakia.   Der Spiegel charged that the goal of the exercise was to limit anuclear exchange to Central and Eastern Europe, while buying timeto negotiate an end to the conflict before a full-scale nuclear warerupted between the superpowers.   ``West Germany is expected to commit suicide as part of theplan,'' Der Spiegel wrote.   NATO and West German officials refused to comment on details ofthe exercise, but confirmed that it took place in a bunker outsideBonn in late February and early March.   Manfred Woerner, NATO's general secretary, said it ``was apurely procedural exercise with innumerable artificial premises andnot an operational scenerio for waging war.''   Spiegel said that under NATO guidelines, the decision to usenuclear weapons hinges on top-level alliance approval and thego-a-head by the U.S. president.   Alliance partners are later consulted as ``time and situationpermits,'' the magazine said.   West German fears are aggravated by a tangle of Allied treatiesand post-war agreements that remain in effect more than fourdecades after the collapse of Nazi Germany.   While a 1959 treaty stipulates that West Germany cannot beforced to accept the stationing of new nuclear weapons on itsterritory, earlier treaties remain in effect that allow the Allies_ the United States, Britain and France _ to routinely replaceoutmoded weapons.   Liberals and leftists charge that West Germany could be forcedto accept new nuclear weapons over its objections.   The West German government, however, insists that it has theright to veto the deployment of new nuclear weapons on its soil.   Foreign Ministry spokesman Hanns Schumacher says, ``There issimply no doubt that West Germany must first agree to accept newnuclear weapons before they are deployed.''   ``Even if a group of lawyers gets together and says that Germanycan be legally forced to accept them, it would really be apolitically unrealistic position for the United States or NATO totake,'' he added.</TEXT></DOC>
