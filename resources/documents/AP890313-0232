On other markets, copper took a pounding following reports thatstocks at the London Mercantile Exchange rose rather than declinedfrom the previous week; grain and soybean futures posted modestgains on technical buying and spillover strength; and frozen porkbelly futures continued drifting lower as the underlying cash markethit nine-year lows.   The energy futures runup began with reports that operations atNorway's fire-damaged Ekofisk complex in the North Sea _ whichproduces about 250,000 barrels of oil daily _ would be down for atleast another day.   Additional support came when non-OPEC oil-producing nations _whose share of the world market exceeds OPEC's _ announced plans tounilaterally cut another 290,000 barrels from their daily output.   ``Admittedly, those were small bits of news, but there's beenstrength underpinning for the market for a while,'' said JimRitterbusch, vice president of trading and research forChicago-based Carson Petroleum Co.   When the April contract topped $18.92, last year's high, it setoff one wave of technical buying _ a decision based on chart-pricecomparisons _ and another wave followed when the market crashed asecond important resistance level at $19.   Ritterbusch said he believes the energy futures will continue torise.   ``The last time we got to $19 was almost two months ago, and thatwas because there was a trading squeeze on when the time came timefor delivery of the Feburary contract. This is a little different.   ``Whenever you set new highs in an uptrend,'' he added, ``theline of least resistance is to the upside.''   Crude oil settled 7 cents to 53 cents higher onbetter-than-average volume on the New York Mercantile Exchange, withthe contract for delivery in April at $19.03 a barrel. Heating oil,which also managed contract highs in the nearby months, were .72cent to 1.16 cents higher, with April at 52.35 cents a gallon; andunleaded gasoline was .90 cent to 1.77 cents higher, with April at53.16 cents a gallon.   Copper was 3.9 cents to 5.1 cents lower on the Comex, with Marchat $1.427 a pound.   The pressure came with news from London Mercantile Exchangeofficials that copper stocks were up 1,775 tons from the previousweek, putting total stocks at 87,525 tons.   ``That's still a relatively low level,'' said analyst BetteRaptopoulos of Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. in New York, ``butsome of the trade were looking for a decline. And when no fresh newscame along to buoy it up, it just kept easing (lower).''   The precious metals, except for platinum, were a model ofconsistency. Platinum was $6.80 to $7.60 lower at the New York Merc,with March at $542.40 a troy ounce. At the Comex, gold was 10 centslower to 10 cents higher, with March at $394.40 a troy ounce; silverwas 1 cent to 1.8 cent higher, with March at $6.078 a troy ounce.   There was little fresh news in the grain or soybean markets, buttechnical buying led to an upswing in the soybean pits that spilledover into the grains.   Most of the technical buying took place in the May contract,which had traded in a range between $7.60 and $7.80 a bushel inrecent sessions. It settled 13 cents higher, closing at $7.82.   Wheat was 2{ cents to 5{ cents higher at the Chicago Board ofTrade, with the contract for delivery in March at $4.38{ a bushel;corn was } cent to 1{ cents higher, with March at $2.77 a bushel;oats were 2} cents to 3\ cents higher, with March at at $2.09} abushel; and soybeans were 7\ cents to 13 cents higher, with March at$7.68{ a bushel.   Livestock futures were mixed and pork futures mostly lower at theChicago Mercantile Exchange.   Live cattle was .45 cent lower to .07 cent higher, with thecontract for delivery in April at 78.12 cents a pound; feeder cattlewere .25 cent lower to .40 cent higher, with March at 81.20 cents apound; live hogs were .17 cent lower to .18 cent higher, with Aprilat 43.62 cents a pound; and frozen pork bellies were .03 cent to .40cent lower, with March at 38.40 cents a pound.</TEXT></DOC>
