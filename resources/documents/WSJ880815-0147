McGraw III, president of McGraw-Hill Inc.'s Financial Services Co., realigned the division, naming new officers to head parts of Standard andamp; Poor's Corp.    Jonathan Newcomb was named president of the Sandamp;P Ratings Group, formerly called Debt Rating, which had been headed by John Dailey until he retired last month for health reasons. Mr. Newcomb, 42 years old, had been president of the Sandamp;P Financial andamp; Economic Information Co., part of the old Debt Rating group.    DRI/McGraw-Hill, a new division, will be headed by George F. Brown, 41, who was named executive vice president of operations. DRI had been part of the Debt Rating group; the division includes Data Resources economic forecasting and information services.    In July, McGraw-Hill announced an initial realignment of the rating company's operations into four groups, broadening reporting responsibilities beyond Sandamp;P's traditional Financial Economic Information Co. and Corporate Information Co.    McGraw-Hill's Donald Rubin, vice president of public affairs, termed the latest moves the &quot;next step&quot; in the reorganization and &quot;evolutionary.&quot; He added that, &quot;This completes the reorganization&quot; at Financial Services Co.    A source close to Financial Services Co. said he was surprised by the announcement, adding that it's &quot;hard to say what the implications&quot; of the moves will be. But he said it would be &quot;business as always&quot; at Sandamp;P's mainstay, the bond rating division.    Sandamp;P/McGraw-Hill, a new securities processing and commodity services company, will be headed by 40-year-old Michael K. Hehir, who was named executive vice president, operations. He had headed the commodities services part of the division.    A. Robert Tominovich, 52, continues as president of the group that provides financial, commodity and economic information products. It has been renamed McGraw-Hill Securities Trading Inc.    Robert W. Mooney, 39, continues as executive vice president of operations at the transportation and trade group, which was named McGraw-Hill International Trade. </TEXT></DOC>
