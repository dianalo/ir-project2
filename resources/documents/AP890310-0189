The president said he will seek legislation empowering thegovernment to block such exports.   ``We're determined to work with other concerned governments toexercise wide stewardship over our environment, particularly wherematters of health are concerned,'' Bush said in remarks at theswearing-in ceremony for Health and Human Services Secretary LouisSullivan.   In the case of U.S. firms, the most frequently used countries forhazardous waste disposal are Canada and Mexico, an EnvironmentalProtection Agency official said. The United States has agreementswith both nations for safe handling of the material, said EPAassistant director for policy Linda Fisher.   Ninety percent of such wastes goes to Canada, she said. BesidesMexico, the other recipient nations are Brazil, Japan and several inWestern Europe. No agreements for safe disposal exist with thosecountries, she said.   However, all of those nations recycle the wastes, so there havebeen no serious health or environment situations created by thedisposal there, she said.   The concerns addressed in Bush's proposal are mostly``futuristic,'' to provide a preventative mechanism, she said.   Environmentalists have raised concerns that some countries,particularly in the developing world, do not regulate disposal andhandling of such wastes in an environmentally safe manner.   Bush said the legislation he will send to Congress ``will givethe U.S. government the authority to ban all exports of hazardouswaste except where we have an agreement with the receiving countryproviding for the safe handling and management of those wastes.''</TEXT></DOC>
