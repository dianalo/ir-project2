Party faithful expressed hope the split would end months ofwrangling that had paralyzed party efforts to prepare for the firstfree elections since 1948.   The roots of the party's ideological struggle go back to 1948,when the Social Democratic Party bowed to pressure from theCommunists and far-left Social Democrats and was absorbed by theCommunist Party.   The party was briefly revived during the 1956 anti-Stalinistrevolution but disappeared again after Soviet tanks invaded andre-established communist domination. It reformed this year,following the now-defunct Communist Party's decision to permitopposition parties and prepare for multiparty elections next year.   The Communist Party dissolved itself Oct. 7 and reconstituteditself as the Hungarian Socialist Party. But many Social Democratsmindful of the 1948 fusion remain mistrustful of the true politicalbeliefs both of the new party and of those they see as seeking tocross over to the Social Democratic Party.   The break occurred Saturday, when Gyoergy Ruttner, a CommunistParty member as recently as January, walked out, followed by about40 delegates to an alternate conference site that was rented inanticipation of the split.   The breakway faction has announced that it is going to organizethe Independent Social Democratic Party, which will be to the leftof the main faction.   The split followed heated debate on whether to represent classicworker interests or be closer to Social Democratic positions foundin Western Europe.   Party spokeswoman Anna Petrasovits told reporters that SocialDemocratic aims included a ``liberal economy, strong unionism,social security.''   Like Warsaw Pact ally Poland, Hungary has made dizzying moves inthe past year to break with its socialist past by establishingdemocratic, economic and social reforms and improve ties to theWest.   The parliamentary elections are to be scheduled by June.</TEXT></DOC>
