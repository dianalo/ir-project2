Suchgating can be done regardless of the pulse technique, enabling its usewith multislice and multiecho software. This ability makes respiratorygating feasible for routine clinical use with the advanced imaging techniquesthat in themselves result in shortening of the effective scan time. Thisis necessary for its application to routine clinical use, since restrictionof data acquisition to the end expiratory portion of the respiratorycycle prolongs the exam time by a factor of 2 to 2.5.</TEXT></DOC>
