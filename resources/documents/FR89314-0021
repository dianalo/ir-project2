As part of the implementation ofthis goal, LSC proposes to prohibit any recipient involvement in redistrictingactivities, as defined in the rule, because redistricting activities arenot related to the delivery of basic day-to-day legal services to the poorand are intertwined with impermissible political activity. The proposedrule is intended to ensure that recipients refrain from becoming involvedin any redistricting activity, since such activity is not consistent withthe Corporation's principal national goal for the provision of legal assistance.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATE: </T2>Comments must be submitted on or before April 13, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESS: </T2>Send comments to Timothy B.

This section mandates that the Corporationensure that recipients, ``consistent with goals established by the Corporation,''adopt procedures and implement local priorities for the provision of legalassistance, taking into account the relative needs of the eligible clientsin the relevant service area. For the reasons set out here, redistrictingactivities are not consistent with the Corporation's goal that scarce resourcesbe focused on meeting the basic day-to-day legal needs of eligible poorindividuals.Section 1007(a)(2)(C) of the Act requires that the Corporation ensure thatits recipients, consistent with goals established by the Corporation, establishpriorities for the provision of legal assistance. In setting such goals,the Congress specifically noted that the Corporation's establishment ofnational goals was ``not intended to detract from the appropriate roleof local programs'' to consult local client communities. <T3>See </T3> H. Rep. No. 310, 95th Cong., 1st Sess. 11 (1977); <T3>see also</T3> S. Rep. No. 172, 95th Cong., 1st Sess. 13 (1977).In the past, the Corporation has asserted this authority to establish nationalgoals. <T3>See, e.g.,</T3> LSC Final Decision to Terminate Funding to San JuanLegal Services, Inc. (Apr. 26, 1979) at 3 (citing Recommended Decisionof Hearing Examiner, wherein the basis for the termination of funding wasin part due to a failure to undertake litigation having a significant impacton eligible clients, in contravention of LSC's then established goals).The purpose of national goals is to provide perimeters to individual recipients,who in turn can set local priorities within those perimeters. Historically,recipients have been accorded substantial discretion in determining theareas to which they will devote resources. <T3>See</T3> 45 CFR Part 1620.For the following reasons, the Corporation has determined that redistrictingactivities are not in accord with the Corporation's goal of focusing scarceresources on the basic day-to-day legal needs of eligible poor individuals.First, redistricting cases are not peculiar to the interests of the poor,since the relief sought would affect entire communities, which are composedof poor and non-poor individuals. Second, redistricting cases have notbeen identified as a priority by LSC recipients. Third, recipient fundscan be better used elsewhere, since alternative organizations are availableto handle redistricting matters. Fourth, recipients would likely be competingwith members of the private bar who handle matters such as these, sinceredistricting cases usually generate attorneys' fees. Finally, involvementin an activity that risks entanglement with political activities shouldbe assiduously avoided by LSC recipients. The prohibition in this partis similar to that contained in section 6 of S. 2409 (1986), a bill introducedby Senators Hatch and Rudman to reauthorize the Legal Services Corporation.<T3>See</T3> 132 Cong. Rec. S5418 (1986).<T3>Allocation of Resources.</T3> Redistricting is not peculiar to theinterests of the poor because redistricting disputes usually involve entirecommunities, which include both poor and non-poor citizens. As the legislativehistory of the Act points out, the Corporation, in the establishment ofnational goals, is to ensure that the provision of legal assistance ismade in the most effective manner and so as to have the greatest effecton the problems of the poor. Since the poor represent a minority, approximately10 to 15 percent of the United States population, the group of eligiblepoor in most communities is relatively small. Since most redistrictingcases are class actions, the putative plaintiff class often may consistof a majority of non-eligible individuals. Similarly, the relief soughtin redistricting cases often would go to the non-poor. Even in redistrictingcases involving discrimination issues, the relief sought would not alwaysgo primarily to eligible poor individuals, as only part of the protectedminority may be eligible. Consequently, the expenditure of recipients'funds on redistricting activities would result in an allocation of resourcesfor the benefit of non-eligible persons.This rule is consistent with current priorities and practice requirements,since redistricting has not been identified as a priority by any LSC recipient.A compilation of the types of cases handled by LSC recipients in 1987 revealsthat approximately 27 percent of the cases involved family matters, 21percent involved housing matters, 18 percent involved income maintenanceissues, and 12 percent were consumer related cases. <T3>See</T3> Legal Services Corporation 1987/1988 Fact Book at 46. However,the need for this rule is supported by the fact that, at other times, LSCrecipients have committed substantial resources to redistricting issues.As noted below, the Corporation estimates that more than 28,000 hours weredevoted to handling redistricting cases from 1978 to 1984, years surroundingthe 1980 census.<T3>Alternative Resources.</T3> Redistricting activities are undertakenby numerous organizations, including the Mexican American Legal DefenseFund, the Southwest Voters Registration Project, Common Cause, the AmericanCivil Liberties Union, the Native American Rights Fund, the NAACP, theLawyers Committee for Civil Rights, the League of Women Voters, the DemocraticNational Committee, and the Republican National Committee. Consequently,there are other entities available to help aggrieved parties, poor andnon-poor alike, who want to seek redress of any preceived malapportionment.Redistricting cases usually offer incentives to members of the privatebar, since under the Voting Rights Act, 42 U.S.C. 1973, and the Civil RightsAttorneys' Fees Award Act of 1976, 42 U.S.C. 1981 and 1988, the right torecover attorneys' fees is specifically provided to prevailing parties.<T3>Subject to Abuse.</T3> In the past, involvement in redistricting activitiesby legal services recipients has been subject to abuse because legal servicesrecipients have linked redistricting activities to obtaining favorableCongressional support for their objectives. One LSC recipient's grant proposaladdressed the need to become involved in State and local redistrictingmatters in order to develop powerful allies for their clients in what therecipient viewed as a battle over the direction of legal services programs.Influencing redistricting in State and local legislative bodies clearlyaffects the political character of those legislative bodies.In response to the requests made on April 11 and May 10, 1984, by the SenateCommittee on Labor and Human Resources, LSC conducted a study of its granteesto determine their involvement in legislative redistricting activitiesarising out of the 1980 census. As a result of two separate monitoringsand 34 responses to an LSC questionnaire that was mailed to all LSC programs,LSC estimates that at least 28,182 hours were spent handling legislativeredistricting cases. Specifically, the LSC study found that LSC recipients,in spite of one recipient's assertion that clients rarely come to the officecontending they have been ``malapportioned'', had sought resources forspecialized computer equipment and a computer specialist to draw new electiondistrict boundaries to the recipients' satisfaction. In addition, recipientshired lobbyists to work on reapportionment issues, yet had no documentedrequest from an eligible client or elected official to undertake this activity.Further, recipients also orchestrated a State-wide effort of legal servicesprograms to ensure elections of specific persons, who would in turn beused as powerful allies in anticipated battles over funding for legal servicesprograms.The LSC study also revealed that certain LSC recipients requested and receivedFederal funds from the Corporation to establish a Voting Rights Projectcenter in connection with the 1980 census for the purpose of strengtheningMexican-American political power, yet had no request from an eligible clientto do so. In addition, these recipients prepared a voting rights litigationmanual that outlined how to select the ``right'' client for a redistrictingbattle and how to locate such a client. Since these redistricting activitieswere obviously conducted by legal services attorneys in pursuit of generalpolicy goals (or even in their own self-interest), rather than in the vindicationof individual clients' rights, it is clear that involvement in redistrictingactivity is subject to abuse and not consistent with the Corporation'sprincipal national goal of providing basic day-to-day legal services toeligible poor individuals.<T3>Risk of Undue Political Entanglement.</T3> The Legal Services CorporationAct declares that ``to preserve its strength, the legal services programmust be kept from the influence of or use by it of political pressures.''42 U.S.C. 2996. The LSC Act also specifically prohibits involvement in``any political activity.'' 42 U.S.C. 2996f(a)(6)(A). Involvement on thepart of LSC recipients in redistricting activities is inherently political.The Supreme Court of the United States has held that ``[p]olitics and politicalconsiderations are inseparable from redistricting and apportionment.''<T3>Gaffney</T3> v. <T3>Cummings</T3>, 412 U.S. 735, 753 (1973).In separate instances, LSC recipients were involved in reapportionmentcases with counsel for the Democratic and Republican parties, respectively.<T3>Upham</T3> v. <T3>Seamon</T3>, 456 U.S. 37 (1982); <T3>Thornburg</T3> v. <T3>Gingles</T3>, 478 U.S. 30 (1986). The Corporation makes no findingas to whether LSC recipients have aligned themselves with a particularpolitical party, but believes that any such alignment is impermissibleunder the Act, since it constitutes political activity.<T3>Competing Political Theories or Philosophies.</T3> Redistricting activitiesseek political outcomes that are normally the product of the legislativeprocess. Indeed, the Supreme Court has stated that courts ``must deferto legislative judgments on reapportionment as much as possible.'' <T3>Upham</T3> v. <T3>Seamon</T3>, 456 U.S. 37, 39, <T3>reh'g denied</T3> 456 U.S. 938 (1982). LSC recipient involvement insuch redistricting activities generally will cause program funds to beexpended in support of one political philosophy, rather than another. In<T3>Baker</T3> v. <T3>Carr</T3>, 369 U.S. 186 (1962), Justice Frankfurter, in his dissent,stated ``What is actually asked of the Court in this case is to chooseamong competing bases of representation_ultimately, really among competingtheories of political philosophy_in order to establish an appropriate frameof government.'' <T3>Id</T3>. at 254.Consequently, the Corporation finds that redistricting activities, as definedin this rule, are so unrelated to basic day-to-day needs of the eligiblepoor and so intertwined with impermissible political activity that theCorporation should not permit its recipients to be involved in such activities.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 45 CFR Part 1632</ITAG>Legal services.For the reasons set out above, 45 CFR Chapter XVI is proposed to be amendedby adding Part 1632 to read as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 1632_REDISTRICTING</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="70">Sec.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1632.1 Purpose.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1632.2 Definitions.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1632.3 Prohibition.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority:</T4> 42 U.S.C. 2996f(a)(2)(C); 42 U.S.C. 2996f(a)(3); 42U.S.C. 2996g(e) of the Legal Services Corporation Act.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 1632.1 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Purpose. </ITAG>This part is intended to ensure that funds available to recipients willbe utilized to the maximum extent for the delivery of basic day-to-daylegal services to eligible poor individuals.
