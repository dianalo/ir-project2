But the poll, which gives the vice president a 55%-to-38% margin over the Massachusetts governor, also shows mounting public disaffection with the entire campaign. In a change from earlier in the race, a solid majority of likely voters now say they are displeased with the choice between the two candidates. And by wide margins, they don't believe that they and their families will be better off under either a Bush or Dukakis administration.    The survey, which began the day after the final presidential debate, illustrates the immense problems Gov. Dukakis faces between now and Election Day. If the 17-point margin holds up, it would mean a landslide for Mr. Bush comparable with Ronald Reagan's 1984 triumph over Walter Mondale.    Campaigning in Dayton, Ohio, Mr. Dukakis said the election was a &quot;close race&quot; and he argued that such public opinion polls were skewing the political process. &quot;This business of polls is really having a terrible effect,&quot; he said. &quot;Now we have got a new set of numbers that has absolutely no relationship to {any numbers} that we or other people have.&quot;    Mr. Bush has built his lead through his success at painting Mr. Dukakis as out-of-step with mainstream America, and through rising voter satisfaction with Mr. Reagan and with staying on the path of his policies.    The poll suggests that Republicans' attacks on the Massachusetts prison-furlough system, Mr. Dukakis's membership in the American Civil Liberties Union and his veto of a pledge-of-allegiance bill appear to have taken hold with the voters. Seventy-one percent of likely voters believe that Mr. Bush &quot;represents traditional American values,&quot; while only 48% believe that Mr. Dukakis does.    The GOP attacks have succeeded in tarnishing Mr. Dukakis to such an astonishing extent that substantially more voters now have an unfavorable opinion of him than have a favorable one -- 50% to 36%. By contrast, they view the vice president favorably by 55% to 33%.    Meanwhile, an electorate that earlier in the campaign strongly favored a change in the nation's course is now closely divided -- a movement in opinion that works to the GOP's advantage.    Last June, when Mr. Dukakis enjoyed a big lead in the polls, 59% of likely voters in the Journal/NBC poll favored a change in direction in the nation's policies, while 34% favored continuing along the path of Mr. Reagan's policies. Now, 47% favor change, 45% favor continuation. Moreover, Mr. Reagan's own job-approval rating has risen to 59% -- its highest level since the Iran-Contra scandal erupted two years ago -- and a large majority of those who approve of his performance also back Mr. Bush.    But the public seems sour on the current campaign. In an almost exact reversal of previous sentiment, likely voters by a 57%-to-38% margin now are displeased with the choice between Mr. Bush and Mr. Dukakis; even half of the front-running Mr. Bush's supporters don't like the choice. When asked whether this year's candidates and campaign are better or worse than in prior years, about three times as many people say worse as say better.    Asked whether they and their families will be better off under a new president than they are now, likely voters say &quot;no&quot; to Mr. Dukakis by 57% to 28%, and &quot;no&quot; to Mr. Bush by 51% to 27%.    Mr. Bush's choice of Dan Quayle to be his vice presidential running mate remains broadly unpopular. Fifty-four percent of likely voters think it is a &quot;bad choice,&quot; while they view Sen. Quayle unfavorably by 41% to 36% and believe by a better than two-to-one margin that Democratic candidate Lloyd Bentsen would make a better president. The negative views about Sen. Quayle have all climbed since his debate with Sen. Bentsen.    But Mr. Dukakis was unable to build on Sen. Bentsen's showing during the governor's own debate with Mr. Bush last Thursday. By a better than 3-to-1 margin, those voters who heard or read about the presidential debate think the vice president did a better job. That is a wider margin than some surveys taken immediately after the debate, suggesting a &quot;ripple effect&quot; as more and more news reports crowned the vice president the winner. Seven of 10 voters agree with Mr. Bush's charge that Mr. Dukakis would be very likely to raise taxes; only three in 10 agree with Mr. Dukakis's allegation that the vice president would cut Social Security.    The Journal/NBC poll shows that strong majorities of likely voters would rather have Mr. Bush in the White House in case of a crisis, and believe he would do a better job than Mr. Dukakis in maintaining a strong national defense, dealing with the Soviet Union, handling the nation's economic problems and being tough on crime. By narrower margins, they also think the vice president would best handle drug problems and make better appointments to the Supreme Court. Nearly six in 10 voters think Mr. Bush would be as strong a leader as President Reagan; only four in 10 think Mr. Dukakis would.    The poll shows the vice president leading among most demographic groups. He has a huge, 2-to-1 lead among men but a narrower, four-point lead among women; has nearly 2-to-1 leads among whites and blue-collar voters; and for the first time holds a narrow lead among those Democrats who voted for Mr. Reagan four years ago.    He also leads in every region of the country, the poll shows -- by 25 percentage points in the South, 21 points in the Midwest, 13 points in the East and 10 points in the West.    ---   'Are you pleased with the choice between George Bush and Michael Dukakisas the presidential candidates, or do you wish you had a different set of choices?'
