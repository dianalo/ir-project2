A supertwistorsuperconnection is introduced on this superbundle which is wholly determinedby the superconformal structure of the base N=2 superspace. The Yang-Millsequations for this superconnection are shown to be exactly equivalentto the superfield equation of motion of N=2 conformal supergravity. AWeyl-like modification of the supertwistor superconnection is proposed.The Yang-Mills equations for this reduce to the the equation of motionof N=2 conformal supergravity coupled to a N=2 Maxswell superfield.
