The effects of temperature, alloy composition,and neutron fluence were observed on tritium recovery. Tritium was releasedmainly as HT from the alloy and its release rate was controlled by bulkdiffusion in the alloy. From the chemical analysis of tritium speciesin the alloy, it was found that free tritium atoms in the T/sup 0/ statediffuse more rapidly than the others such as tritide ions in the T/sup-/ state. The diffusion mechanism for each species was discussed basedon the obtained diffusion coefficients. It was also found that free tritiumatoms might be trapped by radiation defects produced in the alloy.</TEXT></DOC>
