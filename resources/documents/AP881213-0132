Statistical analysis of children infected as newborns suggeststhat of those who will develop AIDS by age 10.4, half may remainhealthy until age 4.8, researchers said.   About 20 percent will develop AIDS within the first year of lifeand the rest at about 8 percent a year, the analysis suggested.   Such incubation periods are longer than those previously reportedin children, and ``strongly suggest there is a large population ofchildren who are infected but not yet diagnosed'' with AIDS,researchers wrote in the British journal Nature.   But they cautioned that their estimates are subject tosubstantial error because of lack of solid information aboutincubation periods of the AIDS virus.   One researcher also said it is unclear what fraction of infectednewborns the projections apply to, because nobody knows whatfraction develops AIDS by age 10.4, the cutoff used in the study.   ``We cannot make any inferences for incubation periods longerthan 10.4 years'' because the disease is too new, said Ivan Auger ofthe New York State Department of Health.   He described the work in last week's Nature with colleagues atthe department, the New York City health department and the HarvardSchool of Public Health.   They developed statistical analyses from the records of 215children with AIDS who had apparently been infected by theirmothers, which can occur during pregnancy or delivery.   Currently, most infected newborns who develop AIDS are diagnosedby age 2, said Margaret Oxtoby of the federal Centers for DiseaseControl. Other children have reached ages 7 or 8 before developingsymptoms, she said.   But the true distribution of incubation periods in children isnot yet known, she said. Current observations underestimate itbecause the disease is relatively new, and only children who developsymptoms soonest after infection are being observed, she saidTuesday.   The new study ``just highlights the fact that we haven't seen thewhole epidemic yet,'' she said. ``It's still unfolding in front ofus.''   While the projections are useful for pointing out that ``there'smore out there than meets the eye ... I would just hesitate inputting weight on a specific figure,'' she said.   The analysis suggested that some children may have a briefincubation period, with half diagnosed within 4.1 months of birth.But most children appear to have a longer incubation, with half ofthem being diagnosed only by about age 6.   Researchers have no explanation for such a difference, Auger saidMonday.   Lynne Billard of the University of Georgia in Athens, who hasstudied AIDS incubation periods, said she was unaware of any similarstudy of children infected by their mothers. The new work isimportant for exploring that ground, she said.</TEXT></DOC>
