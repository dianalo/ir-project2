<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-22-1442 </DOCNO><TEXT>Appendix A to 10 CFR 100 defines the legal requirements for geologic andseismological siting criteria for nuclear plants in the U.S., as wellas in many other countries where plants have been purchased from Americanvendors. Originally written to address the siting of plants in California,this regulation has been applied worldwide far beyond its original intent.In particular, legalistic interpretations of the concepts of 'tectonicprovince' and 'capable fault' have caused considerable confusion resultingin licensing delays for many plants. Newly developed procedures suchas probabilistic hazard analyses are not accounted for, especially fordefining the OBE. The current environment of rapidly developing technologydictates that Appendix A should be revised to a highly generalized document,with analytical details specified in Regulatory Guides, which can beimproved upon as technology changes.</TEXT></DOC>
