Bow Valley is an oil and gas exploration and oil-well service concern. The sale includes assets that produced about 3,000 barrels of oil and 15 million cubic feet of natural gas a day last year, and 2.6 million tons of coal. Bow Valley continues to operate real estate holdings in Utah and a small coal mine in Pennsylvania.    As reported previously, proceeds from the sale, which took effect Oct. 1, will be used to reduce debt. Bow Valley also will record a fourth-quarter one-time write-off of $26 million as a result of the sale. For the 1985 fourth quarter, Bow Valley posted profit from operations of $7.6 million, or 11 cents a share. A one-time gain of $118.9 million resulted in net income of $16.5 million, or $3.11 a share. Revenue totaled $143.2 million. </TEXT></DOC>
