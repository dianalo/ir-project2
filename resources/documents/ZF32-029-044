(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>LPSandM;KEYFLEX 3.02andM;KeyFlex is amazingly flexible and useful, with every feature required of asolid structured editor, and then some.andP;  Its only significant flaw is that,while developers can change the formatting of templates, they cannot writetheir own grammars.andM;Structured editing of Ada programs was easy with KeyFlex, but PC Week Labsfound Candplus;andplus; structured editing clumsy since LPS' Candplus;andplus; templates follow the bulkyCandplus;andplus; grammar too closely.andP;  Candplus;andplus; structured editing would be much nicer to usewith some &quot;sugaring&quot; of the template menus.andM;Although the Candplus;andplus; grammar is unfriendly, the Candplus;andplus; template menus should not be.andO;For example, there is no class template in the first menu.andP;  Instead,developers must go down four levels in grammar to get to the class templatebecause of where it occurs in the Candplus;andplus; grammar.andP;  KeyFlex gets its highestmarks for the ease of switching between text mode and structured mode.andP;  Forexample, PC Week Labs easily added several assignment statements to thesequence of statements in a previously created If construction, by clickingwhere the assignment statements should go and just typing them in.andM;KeyFlex makes good use of color in displaying the program, employing colorand a bold typeface for keywords and black for the rest of the program text.andM;Although PC Week Labs found this useful when reading the program text, itwould be more effective if placeholders appeared in a third color.andM;One of KeyFlex's many helpful features is the Search command.andP;  In the searchpattern &quot;k procedure d sum k loop /aandplus;b,&quot; for example, &quot;k&quot; means keyword and&quot;d&quot; means declaration, so the pattern means to search for a procedurecontaining a declaration for sum and a loop in which the pattern &quot;aandplus;b&quot;appears.andP;  These easy-to-use patterns can also be used for search-and-replacecommands.andM;For an additional charge, LPS bundles KeyFlex with KeyOne, its hypertextprogram-development system.andP;  With KeyOne, programmers can use stepwiserefinement.andM;Using a sample program supplied with KeyOne, PC Week Labs found the programand its on-line documentation easy to read and understand, since eachrefinement and its documentation, placed in hypertext, could be readilyviewed in pop-up windows.andP;  KeyOne offers a solution for developers seeking asolid structured editor and an effective development system.andM;------------------&quot;VITAL SIGNS&quot; DATAandM;LPS Torino, ItalyandM;LPS' U.S.andP;  operations are in Woodside, Calif., at (415) 851-8021andM;Privately heldandM;Year established: 1979andM;Number of employees: 12andM;Gross annual revenue (1990): $1 millionandM;Gross annual earnings (1990): $50,000andM;Source.andP;  Information supplied by company.andM;</TEXT></DOC>
