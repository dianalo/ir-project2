Reiswig Jr., vice president ofprogramming for IBM's Entry Systems Division.andM;Because it has been around so long, PostScript is available on the widestvariety of output devices, including laser printers, very-high-resolutiontypesetters, and film recorders, which produce color slides andtransparencies.andP;  &quot;A user who rates that kind of portability highly willprobably look toward PostScript, as will those who want to stay within IBM'sSAA guidelines,&quot; says Ed Pullen, service director for printer-market researchat Gartner Group/InfoCorp, a market research firm in Santa Clara, Calif.andM;If PostScript is so widely accepted, why bother with TrueType?andP;  Speed,insists Dennis Adler, type manager for Microsoft, which plans to includeTrueType in future releases of OS/2 and Microsofot Windows.andP;  &quot;[Printing] apage imaged with TrueType is much faster than a page imaged with Adobetechnology,&quot; agrees Louise Domenitz, spokeswoman for Bitstream, a typefacedeveloper located in Cambridge, Mass.andM;The speed differences are due to the way &quot;hints&quot; are encoded for TrueType andAdobe-style fonts.andP;  Hints are mathematical algorithms that describe characterattributes, such as stem weights and character alignment.andP;  They help makescalable fonts appear smooth and regular, regardless of type size.andO;PostScript's algorithms are part of the PostScript interpreter; in TrueTypefonts, hints are encoded in the font itself.andM;According to Adobe, its font technology will get faster.andP;  &quot;We havedevelopments underway to improve performance significantly,&quot; claims Adobe'sBabcock.andP;  But solid benchmark comparisons must await the final version ofTrueType, due later this year.andM;However, the same hinting technique that speeds performance in TrueType alsoslows development time.andP;  Unlike a Postscript font, which can access thealgorithms built into the PostScript interpreter, each TrueType font mustcarry its own hints.andP;  Microsoft's Adler concedes that developing TrueTypefonts is &quot;more laborious&quot; than developing PostScript fonts.andP;  Butfont-development tools coming soon from Bitstream and other companies willmitigate this problem, he says.andM;That's the Microsoft-versus-Adobe story.andP;  But don't count Hewlett-Packardout.andP;  HP, which has sold more than 2 million LaserJet printers, recentlyintroduced the LaserJet III, which includes level 5 of the PCLpage-description language.andP;  HP PCL 5 features Agfa Compugraphic's Intellifontfont technology, improved gray scales, and the graphics capabilitiesavailable in HP's plotters.andP;  This combination of enhancements may be all thetypographic support most people need.andM;&quot;PCL 5 gives a legal or accounting department most of the page-descriptioncapabilities it needs, and it's very fast,&quot; says Bob Pooley, marketingdirector for LaserGo, a supplier of PostScript-emulation software (see thebox above).andP;  And if you find later that you really need PostScript, HP sellsan add-on Adobe PostScript cartridge for $695.andM;Happily for users, the various standards don't appear to be mutuallyexclusive.andP;  For example, Apple says it intends to use TrueType in itsMacintosh System 7.0 operating system, which means that Macintoshes and PCswill share a standard font technology.andP;  IBM says it plans to supportTrueType, as well as Type 1, in future releases of IBM OS/2.andP;  And Microsoft'sTrueImage, because it is essentially a superset of PostScript, supports AdobeType 1, as well as TrueType fonts.andP;  Microsoft intends to release a plug-inTrueType cartridge for HP's LaserJet Series II, IIP, and III.andM;These companies, it seems, are working hard to make their various typeschemes compatible.andP;  They say they want users to be able to concentrate onthe task, not the technology.andP;  But when an industry standard is at stake,it's amazing how many different ways companies can find to be the same.andM;POSTSCRIPT-EMULATION SOFTWAREandM;Printer manufacturers must license Adobe Systems' PostScript interpreter ifthey want their products to be true PostScript printers.andP;  The licensing feecan add $500 or more to the cost of a PostScript-compatible printer.andM;Spotting a market opportunity, several vendors have developed&quot;PostScript-clone&quot; software.andP;  These programs emulate Adobe's PostScriptinterpreter.andP;  They work with dot-matrix, ink-jet, and laser printers, as wellas other output devices, and are relatively inexpensive.andP;  GoScript, forexample, a PostScript-emulation program from LaserGo (San Diego), costs $149for a 13-font version and $299 for a 35-font version.andM;There are drawbacks:  PostScript-emulation programs are generally slower andless convenient to use than a trus PostScript printer, and most of themrequire massive amounts of memory--from 450K to 2.5 megabytes.andP;  Bob Pooley,LaserGo's director of marketing, sees PostScript emulators as the solutionfor people who don't need PostScript's capabilities all day.andP;  One ofLaserGo's customers, for example, uses GoScript to convert 1-2-3 spreadsheetsto a resolution of 196 dots per inch so that it can transmit them via faxmodem to its branch offices.andM;Freedom of Press, from Custom Applications (Billerica, Mass.), requires aslittle as 450K of memory and can use up to 8 megabytes of expanded memory, ifavailable, to speed performance.andP;  The $495 program can use all Adobe Type 1and Type 3 downloadable PostScript fonts, a capability the company claims isunique among PostScript emulators.andM;With GoScript and Freedom of Press, you must print PostScript output to afile before sending it to the printer.andP;  UltraScript ($195 with 25 fonts; $445with 47 fonts) from QMS (Santa Clara, Calif.) can print directly from anapplication.andP;  To do so, however, it needs at least 1.5 megabytes of extendedmemory--2.5 megabytes for top performance.andM;Many experts say PostScript will ultimately reside in the computer ratherthan in the printer.andP;  &quot;That's the way it's done on the Next Computer,&quot; saysTony Bove, editor of The Bove andamp; Rhodes Inside Report on Desktop Publishingand Multimedia.andP;  The advantage of such an arrangement is greater flexibilityand less-expensive printers.andP;  PostScript will reside in PCs, says Bove, &quot;whenPCs are powerful enough and when they can print in a multitaskingenvironment, such as OS/2 or Unix.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
