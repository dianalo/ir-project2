During the late 1970's, home energy ratingsystems (HERS) became important components of several energy conservationprograms conducted by governmental and non-governmental organizationsat national, regional, and local levels. By 1982, it seemed that theidea of a home energy rating system had become entrenched as an effectivemeans of pursuing the goal of energy conservation. Since that time, however,a number of these systems have been abandoned, and only a few have endured.Nevertheless, a number of HERS exist, and interest in HERS has increasedin selected areas of the country. In January 1986, the authors conducteda national telephone survey of home energy rating systems to examinethe different kinds of HERS and implementation systems being used andto discover the range of possible implementation problems and solutionsexperienced by the users of these systems. Major systems were followedup in each state, and the authors examined those operated by local governmentsand utility companies. The authors identified 28 states willing to provideexamples of some form of HERS that was currently in operation. The paperdiscusses HERS distribution and HERS findings.</TEXT></DOC>
