Because this rule concerns a military and foreign affairs function ofthe United States, it is not a rule or regulation within the meaning ofsection 1(a) of Executive Order 12291, and it is not subject to the requirementsof that Order. Accordingly, no preliminary or final Regulatory Impact Analysishas to be or will be prepared. 2. This rule mentions and reduces a collection of information subject tothe Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 <T3>et seq.</T3>). This collection has been approved by the Office of Managementand Budget under control number 0625-0051. 3. Section 13(a) of the Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended (50U.S.C. app. 2412(a)), exempts this rule from all requirements of section553 of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) (5 U.S.C. 553), includingthose requiring a notice of proposed rulemaking, an opportunity for publiccomment, and a delay in effective date. This rule is also exempt from theseAPA requirements because it involves a military and foreign affairs functionof the United States. Because this rule does not impose a new control,it is not subject to section 13(b) of the Export Administration Act. Further,no other law requires that a notice of proposed rulemaking and an opportunityfor public comment be given for this rule. Accordingly, it is being issuedin final form. However, as with other Department of Commerce rules, commentsfrom the public are always welcome. 4. Because a notice of proposed rulemaking and an opportunity for publiccomment are not required to be given for this rule by section 553 of theAdministrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553) or by any other law, undersections 603(a) and 604(a) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C.603(a) and 604(a)) no initial or final Regulatory Flexibility Analysishas to be or will be prepared. 5. This rule does not contain policies with Federalism implications sufficientto warrant preparation of a Federalism assessment under Executive Order12612. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 15 CFR Parts 372 and 386 </ITAG>Exports, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.Accordingly, the Export Administration Regulations (15 CFR Parts 368-399)are amended as follows: <ITAG tagnum="52">PARTS 372 AND 386_[AMENDED] </ITAG>1.
