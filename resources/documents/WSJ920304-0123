When I arrived,there were cable cars running in downtown Los Angeles. InLong Beach, I remember the wooden Rainbow Bridge tracing anarc across the water. Traveling to New York, a friend took meto Coney Island, where we rode the famous Cyclone rollercoaster.   I still remember the sensations of those earliestexperiences in the U.S. This is America] This is incredible]It's so great, so exciting]</LP><TEXT>   Thinking back on those times, it strikes me that my hostsmust have been very generous and kind indeed. Practicallyilliterate in the English language, and ignorant of Americanetiquette, we Japanese were treated remarkably kindly.   Today, I am astonished by how short the distance betweenAmerica and Japan, in a business sense, has become. Not evenwe Japanese could have foreseen the proliferation of so manyof our companies on U.S. soil. Moreover, the speed by whichmany of these companies have come to depend on Americans notonly as consumers, but as the producers of our products andservices for world-wide markets, is truly staggering.   The sad fact remains, however, that the cultural andsocial distance between Americans and Japanese remains huge.And it needn't be.   Today, the number of Americans working for Japanesecompanies exceeds 400,000. By including the families of thesepeople, it's quite possible that more than one millionAmericans depend on Japanese companies for their livelihood.I firmly believe that important changes would take place morerapidly if Japanese companies listened and spoke to Americansthrough these one million voices.   The dilemma, however, is that some Japanese companiesmight not like what they hear. They may talk about suchconcepts as a &quot;borderless company,&quot; but in reality, theydon't always take the time to hear the Americans who arestriving to create a relationship based on trust andteamwork.   At Mitsubishi's big-screen color television manufacturingfacilities in the U.S., we have a policy of line-levelemployees meeting every morning with their supervisors, inorder to keep the channels of communication open between theworker and management. Each day, products are pulled off theproduction line, and employees are encouraged to makecomments as to their performance and overall quality. Eachmonth a handful of employees from all levels meets with topmanagement to share concepts, air complaints and even makecriticisms.   At one of our plants, the rate of employee turnover isextremely low -- less than 1%. Similarly, absenteeismcommonly runs less than 1% of total working hours per month.There is a feeling among these people that I cannot fullydescribe, but I'm very proud of what we've accomplishedthere.   More generally, however, I'm afraid Americans and Japanesestill have a long way to go. Certain examples I recall fromover the years:   -- The company lunch hour where a group of Japaneseemployees regularly left to eat Japanese food by themselves,rather than seek camaraderie with their American colleagues.   -- After a long work day, the Japanese expatriate withsleeves rolled up fires fax after fax back to the head officein Japan late into the night.   -- At the golf club, one Japanese member and threeJapanese guests leave immediately after finishing theirround, rather than mixing with others at the clubhouse.   Perhaps the most telling example of our sometimes awkwardbehavior can be found at U.S.-Japanese conferences. Whilemany of the Japanese representatives have strong interests inattending these conferences, they seldom show the sameconcern for what they plan to say. It oftens seems that thehigher the representative's rank, the less likely he is towrite his own speech or add his own thoughts. Thus, manyJapanese are unable to make significant contribution to thesemeetings.   As one U.S. speaker put it: &quot;There are wide differences inour perceptions. Even our national symbols -- the eagle andthe chrysanthemum -- are very dissimilar. But let's havefruitful discussions today rather than exchanging meaninglesssmiles and the storing of our speeches in a drawer.&quot;   For a people who have been instrumental in bringingtelecommunications, computers, cellular phones and faxmachines to the world, we can be really lousy communicators.   Part of our problem, clearly, is a nagging languagebarrier. Without proficiency in English, it's only naturalfor a Japanese to clam up when appearing in public and makingformal presentations. I firmly believe, therefore, thatJapanese coming to do business in America for any significantlength of time should strive for command of the Englishlanguage.   There's another factor as well. In a public forum, manyJapanese don't display a personal style. Worse yet are thosefor whom silence is golden. Non-participatory figureheadsrepresenting Japan at international conferences provide apoor example of our communicative abilities. We Japanesewould be best to remember that in the new global businessenvironment the exchange of information is the key tosuccess. We must admit our weakness and move on to getprofessional training in the areas of speechmaking,interviews and image enhancement.   We need to be firm on this matter of broadening ourcommunication skills not only among CEOs, but among otherindividuals rotated between the head office in Japan and U.S.operations. Often, a middle executive will come from Japanand stay just a few years -- rarely more than five or six.Then, seemingly overnight, he's gone, often never to returnfor more than a business trip or vacation.   Because of our fear of appearing over-assimilated and thelong-range view we Japanese take in almost anything, thisarrangement can breed an &quot;I never had enough time&quot; attitudetoward enhancing one's experience beyond the office. Left totheir own devices, the vast majority of Japanese would spendall their time in the office and at home, rather than gettinginto mainstream American business and social life. Maybe weneed to take a page from America's book: Work fewer butsmarter hours, and experience a little more. Americans andJapanese need to do more together, working more closely inbusiness and learning more about one another's culture fromsocial mingling.   The summer before last I invited family, friends andcompany employees to climb Mt. Whitney, one the highestmountains in the continental U.S. We had an opportunity toacclimate to the elevation before the final approach to thesummit. I believe that business relations between my nativeand adopted countries must also be approached in this manner:Aim for the highest goals and reach them one ledge at a time.I know the top can be achieved. If we Japanese start theclimb, my experience tells me we're going to be met more thanhalfway up the mountain.   ---   Mr. Kiuchi is chairman and CEO of Mitsubishi ElectronicsAmerica.</TEXT></DOC>
