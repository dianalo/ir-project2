(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A Korean-American businessman charged withtrying to export nerve gas also held classified documents revealingthe United States' capability to intercept enemy communications, thegovernment disclosed Tuesday.   Papers filed in U.S. District Court by prosecutors fighting therelease of Juhwan Yun on $2 million bail gave new details on thedocuments, which Assistant U.S. Attorney Anne Singer earlier saidwere found on a desk at Yun's import-export business.   ``Revelation of the information would not only compromisespecifics of our EW (Electronic Warfare) capabilities but would alsoreveal details of our knowledge of enemy threat,'' said a memorandumwritten by Navy Capt. M. Oetinger, vice director of the Pentagon'sJoint Electronic Warfare Center, to the U.S. Customs Service.   Yun was arrested Jan. 12 by U.S. Customs Agents when he arrivedfor a meeting with an undercover agent he believed was an armsdealer.   After a hearing Monday, U.S. District Judge H. Lee Sarokinordered Yun released, saying the government failed to demonstratethat Yun was a risk to flee. But he stayed his order to give thegovernment time to appeal the decision.   After the government filed the new information Tuesday, Sarokinrefused in a late afternoon court hearing to reconsider hisdecision, but again stayed the order, until 3:30 p.m. Wednesday, togive the government time to take the matter to the 3rd U.S. CircuitCourt of Appeals.   Ms. Singer has argued that Yun apparently had contacts withseveral foreign governments, which would prefer he not stand trialin the case.   The government previously has said Yun may have had contacts atU.S. military installations. The documents filed Tuesday reveal thatthose contacts may have been at U.S. bases in other countries.   Pentagon spokesman Lt. Col. Arnie Williams said he had reviewedthe government disclosures but declined comment.   The new information filed alleges that Korean-language documentsmarked ``Secret'' and found in Yun's office show how much is knownabout an unidentified enemy's electronic signals and gives detailsof specialized warfare systems expected for use in the years 1992and beyond.   The government's new filings do not say if the documents werefrom the South Korean government or if the enemy mentioned was NorthKorea.   The Korean-language documents also discussed electroniccountermeasures, the jamming of enemy signals and the deposition,numbers and locations of enemy forces, according to the court papers.   Yun is charged along with a Briton for allegedly plotting to buythe nerve gas sarin and other military equipment for export.Authorities have said the nerve gas's possible destination was Iran.   Richard Cimusz, an FBI counterintelligence agent, said in a newaffidavit filed Tuesday that Yun had been investigated previouslyfor allegedly trying to obtain other military equipment, includingnight-vision equipment, fighter planes and tank parts.   The government has said Yun boasted of high-level military andcivilian contacts with Yugoslavia, the People's Republic of Chinaand South Korea.   Cimusz said that Yun has had contact with officials of twodifferent countries that ``are of counterintellgnece interest to theFBI'' and that he had ``official documents from a third country ofcounterintelligence interest to the FBI.''</TEXT></DOC>
