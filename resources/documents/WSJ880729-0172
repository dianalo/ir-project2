Central bank officials attributed the increase mainly to continued strong exports.    The current account comprises trade in goods and services, as well as some unilateral transfers.    The country's merchandise trade surplus rose in June to $1.03 billion from $823 million a year earlier, the officials said. South Korea's trade surplus with the U.S. in the first six months fell to $3.91 billion from $4.59 billion a year ago, as imports from South Korea's biggest market rose at a much faster rate than exports to the U.S. </TEXT></DOC>
