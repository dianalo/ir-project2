SCHMID</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Americans living east of the Rocky Mountainshave a major earthquake in their future _ probably in the next twodecades _ a panel of experts is warning.   ``Terra firma is an illusion,'' Russell Christesen, chairman ofthe board of Ebasco Services Inc., said Tuesday at a symposiumcalled to discuss earthquake hazards and the federal response. Hesaid any portion of the nation can be affected by quakes.   ``The major problem is lack of awareness that there is aproblem,'' added Robert L. Ketter, director of the National Centerfor Earthquake Engineering Research at the State University of NewYork at Buffalo.   ``The public is not concerned because people have not felt aquake in their lifetime. This (meeting) is an effort to shake upthat complacency,'' Ketter said.   Ketter warned that a major earthquake is nearly certain tostrike the eastern two-thirds of the nation in the next 20 years,threatening havoc in a region unprepared for such a disaster.   While he could not pin down a specific location for the temblor,he said likely sites include the areas of Memphis, Tenn.,Charleston, S.C., Boston, and New York City. He also included awestern area on the list: Salt Lake City, Utah.   The probability of a destructive quake occurring at anyparticular spot is low, Ketter said.   ``However, the probability of one occurring somewhere in theeastern United States before the year 2000 can be considered betterthan 75 percent to 95 percent. Before the year 2010, nearly 100percent.''   Unlike Californians, residents of the states east of the RockyMountains have paid little attention to the danger of quakes.   There are no building codes calling for quake resistantbuildings in the East, Ketter said, and little public notice of thedanger.   And yet the strongest earthquakes ever to strike the UnitedStates occurred in the Memphis, Tenn.-New Madrid, Mo., region in1811-1812, Ketter noted. In addition, a disastrous quake shookCharleston, S.C., in 1886, and other strong quakes have been feltin the Boston area and along the U.S.-Canadian border.   A tremor shook Jamaica Bay in New York in the 1800s, he said,that, if repeated today, would cause as much as $7 billion indamage in the Brooklyn area.   While California _ in particular along the famous San Andreasfault _ has been the subject of great attention, quakes in the Eastare less well understood.   But when they do occur, the rigid rock underlying the stateseast of the Rocky Mountains carries the shock to much greaterdistances than California temblors.   The 1811-1812 quakes in the Missouri-Tennessee border regioncaused church bells to ring as far away as Boston, 1,000 milesdistant, Ketter said.   Those quakes are little remembered because the region was onlysparsely populated at the time. If they were repeated today theresult would be havoc, Ketter and others reported.   Ketter and Robert Chartrand, of the Congressional ResearchService at the Library of Congress, presented a scenario for a newMemphis-area quake.   A tremor equivalent to one of the three major shocks of the pastcould be expected to kill as many as 200 people, injure 8,000 andleave an estimated 250,000 homeless in the Memphis vicinity,Chartrand estimated.   And Ketter said the potential death toll could range from nearly700 to almost 5,000 in the six cities nearest the center of thequake: Memphis; Paducah, Ky.; Carbondale, Ill.; Evansville, Ind.;Poplar Bluff, Mo.; and Little Rock, Ark.   Near the epicenter most homes and buildings could collapse;dams, dikes and embankments would fail; and there would belandslides. Farther away, masonry houses could collapse, framehouses shift on their foundations, trees topple and cracks appearin slopes, Ketter said.   Chartrand's study forsees a bridge collapse over the MississippiRiver; widespread flooding in the Memphis area; failure of gas,electric, water and sewer systems; disruption of oil and naturalgas pipelines passing through the region; hospitals damaged andoverwhelmed with patients; transportation disrupted; and othermajor problems.</TEXT></DOC>
