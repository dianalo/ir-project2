JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   President Bush today unveiled a sweepinglegislative proposal to cut acid rain pollutants and curb smogplaguing the nation's cities, declaring ``too many Americanscontinue to breathe dirty air.''   The president's proposal, aimed at breaking a decade-longcongressinal stalemate that has blocked enactment of tougher federalclean air laws, calls for a 50 percent, 10-million-ton reduction insulfur dioxide emissions, a chief cause of acid rain, fromcoal-burning power plants.   Other measures include a phase-in of cars powered by methanol,aimed at curbing ozone-causing emissions from motor vehicles, and arequirement for industry to use new technology to curb the releaseof cancer-causing and other toxic chemicals.   In a White House speech, Bush said that while some progress hasbeen made in cutting air pollution, ``over the last decade we havenot come far enough.''   ``Too many Americans continue to breathe dirty air _ andpolitical paralysis has plagued further progress against airpollution ... Every American expects and deserves to breathe cleanair,'' he said.   Bush said the new requirements call for ``tough choices'' to bemade by Congress and industry.   But he said action was required because of the ``millions ofAmerican who still breathe unhealthy air'' and the danger this posesto vulnerable groups such as the elderly, asthmatics and children.   The president received a standing ovation after his speech fromthe more than 300 people crowded into the East Room. The invitedaudience included governors, leaders of Congress, environmentalistsand industry representatives.   Brooks B. Yeager, vice president for government relations of theNational Audubon Society, said, ``We may quarrel with some of thedetails, but it's certainly a major step forward.''   Yeager and other environmentalists praised Bush's blueprint forstopping acid rain but said he was not going far enough to controltoxic poisons and other pollutants that are severe public healththreats.   David Gardiner, legislative director for the Sierra Club, said,``The president has laid out a bunch of very good objectives. Itwill help break the logjam in Congress.''   Earlier at a news briefing, William K. Reilly, administrator ofthe Environmental Protection Agency, called the clean air plan``very ambitious and expensive'' but vitally needed.   Reilly estimated the program's cost at between $14 billion and$19 billion a year once it is in full effect at the turn of thecentury.   Among the actions, the president called on Congress to requireautomakers to phase in cars that use alternate fuels such asmethanol with a goal of having 500,000 such vehicles in operationwithin six years and 1 million such cars produced annually after1996.   Unlike gasolone, methanol does not produce the hydrocarbons andnitrogen oxides that are an ingredient in the ozone that causes thesevere smog problems that have made the air unhealthy in nearly 100metropolitan areas.   Reilly said Bush's proposals would bring most American citieswithin federal air quality standards by 1995 and all but the mostsevere problem areas _ Los Angeles, Houston and New York City _within the guidelines by the year 2000.   The proposed legislation also calls for tightening tailpipeemissions from automobiles by 40 percent, and curbing otherautomobile fuel-related pollutants.   In an attempt to curb the release of toxic chemicals fromindustrial plants, Bush proposed requiring industry to use the``best available'' technology to curb such pollution. The plananticipates ``near term'' reductions in airborne toxic chemicals,including many that are cancer causing, of between 75 and 90 percent.   The proposals are part of a clean air package the president plansto send to Congress in the coming weeks. Environmental legislation,some of it calling for stronger actions than proposed by thepresident, already has been introduced on Capitol Hill.   Congressional leaders said they expect a revision of the 1970Clean Air Act, which was last changed in 1977, to be enacted in thisCongress, probably early next year.   The proposal to combat acid rain calls for half of the10-million-ton reduction in sulfur dioxide to be achieved by 1995.The proposal would allow utilities that exceed the requiredreductions to accumulate credits that would be sold or traded toother utilities that are unable to reach the reduction targets.   About 20 million tons of sulfur dioxide gas are released annuallyinto the air, most from power plants that burn high-sulphur coal.The gas turns into sulfates, combines with moisture and falls asrain or snow often hundreds of miles away.   Scientists have blamed acid rain for causing substantial damageto lakes, forests and acquatic life, especially in the Northeast andCanada as a result of pollutants released from power plants in theOhio Valley and industrial Midwest.   Bush's clean air package has been widely viewed as the first testof whether his administration plans to act decisively onenvironmental issues.   Governors active in the bipartisan Alliance for Acid Rain Controlsaid in a television interview before the announcement that theywere encouraged by Bush's plan.   ``There is no question it's going to be enforced,'' WisconsinGov. Tommy Thompson said on ``CBS This Morning.'' ``... It's a giantstep forward for cleaning up the air and the atmosphere and ourlakes, especially in states like Wisconsin and Minnesota.''   The president promised in his campaign last year and repeatedlysince taking office that he will move to tighten the federal cleanair laws, especially by taking action to curb acid rain.   Last week Bush told a conservation group the clean air package heintends to send Congress would represent ``sweeping changes'' in the1970 Clean Air Act and ``significantly improve every NorthAmerican's quality of life'' whether they live near industrialplants or in the countryside.   The final package was approved by Bush over the weekend at CampDavid where the president reviewed an array of option papersprepared by his Domestic Policy Council, which had debatedprovisions of the package for weeks.   Urban smog, largely caused by automobile pollutants, has been oneof the most difficult issues facing the administration. Adviserswere split over whether to require specific curbs to reduceozone-causing pollutants or allow automakers and the petroleumindustry to decide how best to meet government targets.   Legislation already has been introduced in the House to requirestringent reductions in ozone-causing pollutants, cuts in acid rainpollutants from coal-burning power plants and curbs in the releaseof toxic chemicals from industrial plants.   Some of the legislation already before Congress is tougher thanthat envisioned by Bush's advisers.   Environmentalists, for example, have sought a reduction in sulfurdioxide from power plants of at least 12 million tons over the nextdecade and have argued for tougher automobile emission controls.</TEXT></DOC>
