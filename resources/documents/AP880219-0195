Ford will distribute $635 million in profit-sharing to hourlyand salaried workers March 8. The No. 2 automaker said it isbelieved to be the largest one-year payout ever by a major U.S.corporation.   Ford's chief financial officer, Stan Seneker, announced thefigures to cheering workers at Ford's Michigan Truck plant inWayne, just west of Detroit. The announcement was broadcast live to200 Ford facilities nationwide.   Ford, which earned the highest profits in automotive history in1987, will know in coming weeks exactly how many of its 180,000workers will receive a share, said Ford spokesman Mike Moran said.   ``The company's U.S. employees can take pride in theirperformance as members of the Ford team. It is fitting that theywill share in the results by receiving their largest profit-sharingchecks ever,'' Ford Chairman Donald Petersen said.   United Auto Workers Vice President Stephen Yokich, who heads theunion's Ford department, said the UAW was pleased with the payouts,which were first negotiated in 1982 for 1983 earnings.   But he added, ``We would again urge Ford Motor Co. to allocatemuch more in capital investments from its huge profits intoU.S.-based production of vehicles and components.   ``The real `reward' sought by U.S. workers, consumers andcommunities for their contributions to Ford's success should besizeable additional U.S. investments by Ford toward securing jobsfor the future,'' Yokich said.   Ford has added no assembly plants of its own in the UnitedStates in recent years. Instead, it is building some cars inMexico, and its new Ford Probe sporty coupe is built at a MazdaMotor Corp. plant.   Ford also imports cars from Korea and West Germany and plans tobuild a new Lincoln-Mercury luxury convertible in Australia.   In 1987, Ford outearned industry-leader General Motors Corp. forthe second straight year, its profits jumping 41 percent over 1986.   Workers at GM, which earned $3.6 billion, will receive no shareof profits for the second straight year. No. 3 Chrysler Corp. made$1.3 billion in 1987.   Although the formulas for profit-sharing at Ford and GM differ,both are based on the company's U.S. performance. Ford improved itsU.S. earnings in 1987; GM's fell by nearly half from 1986.   The lack of profit-sharing at GM at the same time that thecorporation handed out millions of dollars in executive bonusesangered workers. GM has switched to the Ford formula for thecontract covering 1988-90.   But GM said that even under the Ford formula, it wouldn't haveearned enough in the United States to pay profit-sharing for 1987.   More than 160,250 Ford workers received record profit-sharingpayments averaging $2,100 for 1986, when Ford earned $3.29 billion.   In 1985, Ford profit-sharing averaged $1,200 per worker, $2,000in 1984 and $400 in 1983. In the past five years, Ford said it hasgiven out more than $1.6 billion to its workers.</TEXT></DOC>
