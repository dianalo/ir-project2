The centering arrangement includes a pair of centering rollers spaced      apart a predetermined distance in a direction perpendicular to the      swinging plane of the swing arm. The fixing arrangement includes a single      roller with a diameter larger than the distance between the centering      rollers.

Field of the Invention </PAR><PAR>  The present invention relates to a positioning and fixing apparatus for      positioning a movable member such as a switch girder for a linear motor      car of the levitation type in a predetermined position and fixing it      thereat. </PAR><PAR>  2. Background of the Invention </PAR><PAR>  An apparatus for positioning a girder of a linear motor car of the      levitation type in a predetermined position at which it is switched and      holding it thereat, as shown in FIGS. 6 and 7, comprises centering means      102 fixed to a movable member 101 i.e., a switch girder and a roller 105      provided on a swing arm 104 pivoted in a vertical plane by a stationary      base 103. When the movable member 101, movable linearly or swingeable by      means of wheels 107 guided by rails 106, approaches in the vicinity of the      predetermined position and is then stopped thereat, the swing arm 104 is      swung down by an oil cylinder 108. The centering means 102 is formed, as      shown in FIG. 7, of a guide member comprising a groove 109 fittingly      receiving a roller 105 which serves as a fixing means provided on the      swing arm 104, and a chute shaped guide groove 110 guides the roller 105      into the groove 109. Upon swinging down of the swing arm 104, the roller      105 enters into the groove 109 through the guide groove 110 and the      movable member 101 is centered and fixed thereat. </PAR><PAR>  In the conventional centering means described above, the roller 105 which      serves as the fixing means is forcibly pushed into the groove 109 of the      centering means 102. Therefore, there is a problem that abrasion between      the roller 105 and the wall material of the groove 109 may occur. Once      such abrasion occurs, a precise centering operation becomes impossible and      repair thereof is very difficult. In view of this, an extra centering      means is always required so that it can be exchanged depending upon the      degree of abrasion. This means an increased cost. </PAR><PAC>  SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  An object of the present invention is, therefore to provide a centering and      fixing apparatus for a movable member, which is capable of preventing      centering accuracy from becoming worse due to abrasion. </PAR><PAR>  Another object of the present invention is to provide a centering and      fixing apparatus in which a fixing means and a centering means are in      rolling contact with each other, so that a contact face thereof is always      changed with minimum friction therebetween. Especially, when the movable      member is a longer steel structure such as a truck girder, a sliding      mechanism is provided compensating for thermal expansion or contraction so      that a relative discrepancy is absorbed and function is minimized. </PAR><PAR>  A further object of the present invention is to provide a centering and      fixing apparatus in which a fixing means can be pushed into a      predetermined position with slight force and an accurate and rigorous      centering and fixing effect is achieved. </PAR><PAR>  A still further object of the present invention is to make a centering and      fixing apparatus that is an easily available part, eliminating the      necessity of preparation and stocking of any extra part thereof. </PAR><PAR>  According to the present invention, the above mentioned objects are      achieved by providing a centering and fixing apparatus comprising fixing      means provided on a swing arm supported rotatably in a vertical plane by      providing a, fixed base member and centering means mounted on a movable      member and engageable with the fixing means. The centering means includes      a pair of centering rollers mounted, rotatably with a predetermined      distance therebetween in a direction perpendicular to a swinging plane      (vertical plane) of the swing arm. The fixing means comprises a single      roller having diameter larger than the distance between the paired      rollers, and rotatably supported by the swing arm through a spherical      bearing means. The fixing means can be brought into contact with the      paired rollers. </PAR><PAR>  In the present invention, the roller which serves as the fixing means      passes between the paired centering rollers rotatably supported by the      movable member when the swing arm is swung down. Since the centering      rollers are arranged with the distance therebetween in the direction      perpendicular to the swinging plane of the swing arm, the fixing roller is      brought into contact with the fixing rollers while it moves through them.      If the fixing roller contacts only either of the centering rollers, the      fixing roller pushes the movable member through the centering roller and      centering of the movable member is obtained at a position where both the      centering rollers contact the fixing roller simultaneously. The diameter      of the fixing roller is slightly larger than a distance between surfaces      of the centering rollers and therefore the fixing roller can not pass      through between the centering rollers. The movable member is held and      fixed in the centered position with pressure contact of the fixing roller      with the centering rollers. </PAR></BSUM><DRWD> <PAC>  BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS </PAC><PAR>  FIG. 1 is a front view of a switch girder provided with a centering and      fixing apparatus according to the present invention; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 2 is a side view of the centering and fixing apparatus in FIG. 1 with      its base removed; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 3 is a plan view of a fixing means according to the present invention; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 4 is a partial cross section of the means shown in FIG. 3; </PAR><PAR>  FIGS. 5a-5d show relative positions of the fixing means to the centering      means during a downward swing of the swing arm; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 6 is a front view of a conventional apparatus; and </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 7 is a side view of the apparatus of FIG. 6 </PAR></DRWD><DETD> <PAC>  DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </PAC><PAR>  The present invention is described in detail with reference to an      embodiment shown in the drawings. </PAR><PAR>  In FIG. 1, a movable member 1 such as a switch girder of a linear motor car      of the levitation type is guided linearly or swingingly by a guide member      2. </PAR><PAR>  A centering means 3 is mounted on the movable member 1 and a swing arm 5 is      supported by a fixed base 4 via a shaft 6 rotatable in a vertical plane. A      fixing means 7 is provided at a top portion of the swing arm 5. The swing      arm 5 is drived by an oil pressure cylinder 8 to swing in the vertical      plane. An electrically driven cylinder may be used instead of the      hydraulic cylinder. </PAR><PAR>  As shown in FIG. 2, the centering means 3 is comprised of a pair of      centering rollers 10 rotatably supporting the movable member 1 through      shafts 9, respectively. The centering rollers 10 are arranged horizontally      with a predetermined space therebetween along a line perpendicular to the      vertical plane in which the swing arm 5 can swing. </PAR><PAR>  The fixing means 7 is comprised of with a roller supported rotatably by the      swing arm 5. The diameter of the fixing roller 7 is slightly larger than a      distance between the centering rollers 10 such that when it contacts both      of the centering rollers 10 the movable member 1 is prevented from moving      further. </PAR><PAR>  The swing arm 5 includes an arm body 5a having two arm portions 11 and a      shaft portion 12, as shown in FIG. 3. The respective arm portions 11 are      vertically rotatably supported by bearings 13 fixed to the base 4 through      shafts 14. A gap g is provided between the arm portion 11 and each of the      bearings 13 so that the swing arm 5 can be slightly shifted in the      direction of the shafts 14. </PAR><PAR>  A bracket 15 is fixed to the base 4 at an intermediate position between the      bearings 13, that is, an intermediate position of the swing arm 5.      Expanding bolts 16 are screwed in both sides of the bracket 15 and they      are locked in predetermined adjusting positions by means of lock nuts 17.      The adjusting bolts 16 are coaxially arranged with heads thereof being in      contact with the arm portions 11 of the swing arm 5. Consequently, it      becomes possible to adjust the arm body 5a positionally in the axial      direction of the swing shaft 14 by means of the adjusting bolts 16 while      the heads thereof are kept in contact with the arm portion 11. </PAR><PAR>  As shown in FIG. 4, a spherical bearing 18 is slidably supported by a shaft      portion 12 of the swing arm 5 and the fixing roller 7 is supported by the      spherical bearing 18 slidably along its spherical surface. When the swing      arm 5 swings, the spherical bearing 18, together with the roller 7, is      slidable along the shaft portion 12 by gravity within a predetermined      range determined by a spring 19 provided between the arm body 5a and the      spherical bearing 18. In order to prevent the spherical bearing 18 from      dropping off of the shaft portion 12, a stop ring 20 such as a C-ring is      mounted on a top end portion of the shaft portion 12. In order to ensure      that the slidability of the spherical bearing 18 with respect to the shaft      portion 12 is not degraded by dust, etc., and smooth sliding thereof is      alway realized, a bellows type cover 21 is provided at the front and the      rear of the spherical bearing 18 along the shaft portion 12, as shown in      FIG. 4, to shield the shaft portion 12 against external dust. By ensuring      that the spherical bearing 18 is smoothly slid along the shaft portion 12,      there is no sliding friction and hence abrasion between the fixing means 7      and the centering means 10 even if the relative position between the      movable member 1 and the base 4 is shifted due to thermal expansion or      contraction. </PAR><PAR>  When the swing arm 5 swings down, the roller 7 and the spherical bearing 18      is in a position shown in FIG. 5a with respect to the shaft 12 in which a      component of gravitational force exerted on them in the axial direction of      the shaft 12 and reactive force of the spring 19 are balanced. In FIGS. 5a      to 5d, the roller 7 is shown in a different shape from the one in FIGS. 3      and 4 for simplification. When the arm 5 is further moved down, the roller      7 approaches the centering rollers 10 and eventually point-contacts with      them as shown in FIG. 5b. Since, during the movement of the swing arm 5      from the position shown in FIG. 5a to the position shown in FIG. 5b, the      force component of the roller 7 and the spherical bearing 18 in the axial      direction of the shaft 12 decreases, the spring 19 expands and thus the      roller 7 and the spherical bearing 18 are moved toward a free end of the      shaft portion 12, with a sufficient gap l being kept between the stop ring      20 and the roller 7 on the spherical bearing 18. </PAR><PAR>  When the swing arm 5 further moves after the roller 7 is brought into      contact with the centering rollers 10, the roller 7 slides along the      sphere of the spherical bearing 18 and the contact between the roller 7      and the centering rollers 10 comes a line contact as shown in FIG. 5c.      Thus, the roller 7 is moved down while tilting slightly with respect to      the shaft portion 12. At a time when the roller 7 comes into contact with      both the centering rollers 10 simultaneously as shown in FIG. 5d, a      centering of the movable member 1 with respect to the base 4 is achieved.      When the roller 7 comes to contact with either centering roller 10, the      swing arm 5 is moved down further from the position shown in FIG. 5c while      the roller 7 rotates relative to the centering roller 10 contacted with      the roller 7, during which the movable member 1 is pushed sideward, and,      when the roller 7 contacts both centering rollers 10, the movable member 1      comes to a stop thereat and the centering is completed. </PAR><PAR>  It is preferably that the swing arm 5 becomes substantially horizontal when      the movable member 1 is in the position in which the movable member 1 is      centered. </PAR><PAR>  During the movement of the swing arm 5 moves from the position shown in      FIG. 5c to that shown in FIG. 5d, there is no relative axial movement      between the roller 7 and the centering rollers 10, although the spherical      bearing 18 moves slightly along the shaft portion 12 in an opposite      direction to the stop ring 20, against the force of the spring 19. </PAR><PAR>  When the fixing roller 7 contacts the centering rollers 10 and engages them      in a wedge relation thereto, the movable member 1 is reliably held in the      centered position. In order to make the fixed state reliable, it is      necessary that the engagement between the fixing means and the centering      means can not be broken by a small external force exerted on the movalbe      member 1. To this end, the diameter of the fixing roller 7 is selected      such that the angle between lines connecting a center O of the roller 7 to      contact points A and B thereof with the centering rollers 10 is as close      to 180.degree. as possible. </PAR><PAR>  When the movable member 1 is to be moved, the swing arm 5 should be lifted      up to a position in which the roller 7 can not collide with the centering      rollers 10 when the latter are moved. </PAR></DETD><CLMS> <STM>  What is claimed is: </STM><NUM>  1. </NUM><PAR>  1.
