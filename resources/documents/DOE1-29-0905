<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-29-0905 </DOCNO><TEXT>Direct solutions to problems in mechanics are developed from variationalstatements derived from the principle of invariance of the action integralunder a one-parameter family of infinitesimal transformations. Exact,direct solution procedures for linear systems are developed by a carefulchoice of the arbitrary functions used to generate the infinitesimaltransformations. It is demonstrated that the well-known methods for thesolution of differential equations can be directly adapted to the requiredvariational statements. Examples in particle and continuum mechanicsare presented.</TEXT></DOC>
