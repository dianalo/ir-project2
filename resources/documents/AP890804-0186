Analysts say the datashould ease fears of an imminent recession but heighten concernsabout inflation.   Joblessness was down from 5.3 percent in June, with nonfarmbusinesses adding 169,000 jobs, the Labor Department said.   At the same time, June's job growth was revised from 180,000 to250,000, additional evidence that the economy continues to grow,though at a slower pace than last year.   ``This suggests an economy that is clearly, clearly far from arecession,'' said Elliot Platt, senior vice president of Donaldson,Lufkin andamp; Jenrette. ``Despite a lot of signs of economic weaknessthe labor market remains fairly strong.''   Michael Boskin, chairman of the President's Council of EconomicAdvisers, said the report was ``good news'' and ``suggests theeconomy is continuing to expand.''   While the job growth number provided encouraging news, analystswere wary over data showing significant upward pressure on wages _a welcome development for workers but a sign of stubborn inflationas well.   The Labor Department said average hourly earnings rose 0.8percent in July after increasing just 0.1 percent in the prior twomonths.   ``That's a very, very powerful increase,'' said Platt.   ``Ominous,'' was the way Boston Co. Economic Advisers Inc. chiefeconomist Allen Sinai described the wage gains.   Both agreed that July's wage increase should give pause to theFederal Reserve Board, which of late has relaxed monetary policy inhopes of fueling enough new growth to avert a recession.   ``There will be no more easing by the Fed until after LaborDay.'' said Sinai.   The government said the unemployment rate fell last month eventhough civilian employment declined by 82,000 people to 117.45million. The rate fell because of a larger decline, of 146,000people, in the labor force _ the number of people who have jobs orare seeking employment.   The job growth again came predominantly in the service economy,which accounted for 140,000 of the 169,000 new positions.   Within services, government employment was down by 25,000 jobsbut retail trade added 52,000, wholesale trade 5,000,transportation and public utilities 23,000 and finance, insuranceand real estate 11,000. Both business and health services postedmodest gains, the government said.   The goods-producing sector added 29,000 jobs, with gains inconstruction and manufacturing offset somewhat by declines inmining and the automobile industry.   The 35,000 boost in construction jobs came at the same time thathousing starts and home sales were rebounding. Manufacturing posteda modest gain of 3,000 positions after three consecutive monthlydeclines.   Employment in the auto industry fell by 12,000 jobs last monhafter a decline of 16,000 in June, a slump coinciding with sluggishcar sales.   Employment in mining was down 11,000, a figure heavilyinfluenced by coal strikes in Virginia, West Virginia and Kentuckythat have sparked wildcat actions in other coal-producing states.   The government said the average workweek for production andnonsupervisory employees in private industry increased by 0.3hours, to 34.9 hours. The factory work week held steady at 41 hoursand overtime in July averaged 3.9 hours a week, up from 3.8 hoursin June, the Labor Department said.   The jump in earnings brought average hourly pay in the privatesector to $9.70 on a seasonally adjusted basis, up from $9.62 inJune.   The payroll and wage data are taken from the Labor Department'smonthly survey of businesses. A separate household survey found fewmajor shifts in unemployment among demographic groups, althoughjoblessness among black teen-agers fell to 27.4 percent last monthfrom 36.5 percent in June. The June total had been up from 32.4percent in May.   These were the July and June rates for other population groups:   _Adult white men, 3.8 percent, up from 3.7.   _Adult white women, 4.3 percent, up from 4.1.   _White teen-agers, 13.4 percent, up from 12.6.   _Adult black men, 9.3 percent, down from 9.4.   _Adult black women, 9.9 percent, down from 10.5.   _Hispanics, 9 percent, up fro 8.1.   A separate calculation of unemployment that includes members ofthe armed services stationed in the United States was unchanged at5.2 percent.</TEXT></DOC>
