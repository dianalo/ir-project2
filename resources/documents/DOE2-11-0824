During abrief description of the properties of all charm and beauty particlesreportedly observed in hadron-hadron experiments they discuss the strengthsand weaknesses of the various experimental techniques. In particularthey emphasise the quantitative problems associated with nuclear targetexperiments and show the progress that is being made in understandingthe A-dependence problem. Focussing on charm cross sections the authorssee that the data are becoming sufficiently good to give us a reliableand coherent picture which provides a serious test of the QCD fusionmodel. This same fusion model is then used with existing beauty crosssection determinations to make some extrapolations. Finally, a few remainingpuzzles and curiosities are underlined.</TEXT></DOC>
