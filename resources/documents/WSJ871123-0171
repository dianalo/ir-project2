In a statement on the House floor, Chairman Fernand St Germain charged that Vernon's auditor &quot;apparently failed&quot; to warn of the thrift's serious weakness before it was declared insolvent last March.    Asserting that independent auditors generally have a &quot;questionable record&quot; in auditing thrifts, Mr. St Germain asked Congress's General Accounting Office to investigate whether the auditors are failing to warn against unsound banking practices.    Without mentioning Arthur Young by name, Rep. St Germain, (D., R.I.) summarized criticism of Vernon's independent auditing that he said came from a government consultant.    Arthur Young confirmed that it was Vernon's auditor but declined to respond to specific concerns voiced by Rep. St Germain. William Gladstone, the accounting firm's chairman, pledged to cooperate with any inquiry by Congress, and predicted that &quot;when the facts are known we will be found to have performed our work in accordance with professional standards.&quot; Noting that 80 Texas thrifts currently have negative net worth, he suggested instead an &quot;across-the-board inquiry&quot; into the causes of the thrift crisis there.    Last week, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board closed Vernon's successor, Vernon Federal Savings andamp; Loan Association, at an estimated cost of $200 million in cash and a $1.1 billion note, making it the costliest thrift bailout in history. Vernon Federal had been chartered by federal regulators after they declared Vernon insolvent. Regulators slated its 10 offices to reopen today as branches of a new institution called Montfort Savings Association, which will hold Vernon Federal's deposits of about $1.4 billion.    The Federal Savings andamp; Loan Insurance Corp. will assume the bulk of the thrift's $1.17 billion in assets, which include a heavy proportion of bad loans. Eventually, the board said, the FSLIC hopes to transfer to Montfort some performing loans from Vernon and from other failed thrifts.    Rep. St Germain's comments come as the accounting profession faces growing criticism for sometimes being too cozy with its clients. Chairman Jack Brooks (D., Texas) of the House Government Operations Committee has warned accountants that if their performance doesn't improve, they may face some federal regulation. And the Bank Board is suing some accountants it accuses of failing to adequately audit thrifts that were later closed.    In his statement Friday, Rep. St Germain quoted from a report by an outside consulting firm hired by the Dallas Home Loan Bank to look for any criminal causes of Vernon's decline. He said the report found:    --Vernon's accountants &quot;didn't complete their audits in accordance with generally accepted accounting standards and therefore failed to require adjustments to reported net income and financial position,&quot; which could have triggered regulatory action.    --The audit's &quot;failure may have resulted from negligence and disregard of information that was readily available&quot; to the accountants.    --Consultants by senior accounting firm officials made statements that were &quot;in direct conflict&quot; with data in their audit working papers.    --The auditors failed to call for a loss reserve for loans to six individuals totaling $369 million simply because senior officers of the thrift vouched for the individuals.    The Dallas Home Loan Bank estimates that Arthur Young runs up $5 million to $10 million a year in billings from thrift institutions in Texas. It also served as auditor for two other Texas thrifts that have been declared insolvent in the past 14 months.    Once a sleepy thrift in a small North Texas town, Vernon was purchased in 1982 by Dallas real estate developer Don R. Dixon, who used it to finance lavish California homes, a fleet of planes and loans to cronies, many of which turned sour, and use of a yacht for a Democratic Party fund-raiser in Washington. House Speaker James Wright of Texas had once intervened on behalf of Vernon with thrift regulators.    When Vernon was declared insolvent by federal banking regulators in March, about 96% of its loans were in default. Later, in a lawsuit pending in federal court, the FSLIC said Vernon officers &quot;looted, dissipated and wasted&quot; Vernon's assets. Mr. Dixon has since filed for personal bankruptcy-court protection.    Federal officials said Vernon's condition continued to deteriorate after it was seized last March and placed into receivership. Vernon's loan portfolio is overloaded with loans to real estate projects, mostly in Texas and surrounding states where real estate values have plummeted. </TEXT></DOC>
