On other markets, precious metals were lower; energy futuressurged; grains and soybeans were mixed; livestock and meat weremixed and stock-index futures retreated.   Copper for spot delivery settled 3.7 cents higher at $1.417 apound, just 4.3 cents below the all-time Comex high of $1.46reached last Dec. 31. Copper for delivery in December settled$1.335, up 5.55 cents.   ``There's a very strong chance copper could well take out the$1.50 area on a spot level basis,'' said George Anagnos, metalsanalyst with Thomson McKinnon Securities Inc. in New York.   Labor problems have already cost Peru a 17 percent decline incopper production through August of this year, Anagnos said. Thecurrent miners' walkout, which began on Tuesday, demonstrates that``the labor situation in Peru and the copper mining situation inPeru is something we can't bank on,'' Anagnos said.   Analysts said overall copper production outside of North Americawas expected to decline this year. The United States was theworld's second-largest copper producer last year, just behindChile, and Canada ranked third.   Yet demand for the metal has been strong in recent weeks due toseasonal factors and to the strong economies of the majorindustrialized nations.   The American Bureau of Metal Statistics reported domesticrefined copper inventories of 52,500 short tons at the end ofAugust, a seemingly healthy gain from 42,000 short tons in June.But more than half of the increase was due to a buildup in Comexwarehouse stocks, which have declined rapidly since August.   Furthermore, the August ABMS figure was more than 35 percentbelow the Dec. 31, 1987, level and nearly 63 percent lower thanthat for August 1987.   Precious metals prices finished slightly lower on the Comex.   Gold settled 40 cents lower across the board with December at$414.70 a troy ounce; silver was 1.8 cents to 2.4 cents lower withDecember at $6.405 a troy ounce.   Oil futures prices soared in hectic trading on the eve ofmeetings by two OPEC committees that are expected to focus on thecartel's rampant overproduction.   Hopes of an agreement to rein in production sparked franticbuying, analysts said.   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 78 cents to 84 centshigher with November at $15.40 a barrel; heating oil was 1.18 centsto 1.64 cents higher with November at 43.85 cents a gallon;unleaded gasoline was 1 cent to 2.14 cents higher with November at49.06 cents a gallon.   Wheat and soybean futures, bolstered by a spurt in exportactivity, settled modestly higher on the Chicago Board of Tradewhile corn and oat futures finished mostly lower.   The Agriculture Department said after the close that Egypt hadpurchased 250,000 metric tons of U.S. wheat at subsidized pricesand the Philippines had purchased 35,000 metric tons of subsidizedwheat. Exporters said China had bought 170,000 metric tons ofwheat, also at prices subsidized under an Agriculture Departmentprogram to boost exports.
