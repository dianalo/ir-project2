PerryStaff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 10/29/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> CONGRESS (CNG)EXECUTIVE (EXE) </IN><TEXT>   The six Republican presidential candidates appeared together for the first time in a debate and tried to cut front-runner George Bush down to size.    Two of the darkest horses in the race, former Secretary of State Alexander Haig and former Delaware Gov. Pierre du Pont, attacked the vice president for his support of the proposed arms treaty with the Soviet Union on intermediate-range nuclear missiles.    &quot;The question is: In a Bush presidency, where would he lead America?&quot; Mr. du Pont said. &quot;So far we haven't seen any vision, any principles, any policy.&quot;    Moments later, Rep. Jack Kemp of New York criticized Mr. Bush on the administration's hesitance to deploy the planned anti-missile shield known as the Strategic Defense Initiative.    But the two leaders in the public-opinion polls, Mr. Bush and Kansas Sen. Robert Dole, joined to applaud a bipartisan effort by the White House and Congress to reduce the federal budget deficit. &quot;It is time to lay partisan politics aside,&quot; the vice president said. &quot;Right,&quot; chimed in Mr. Dole, who refused to join Messrs. du Pont and Haig in ambushing the vice president on the arms treaty.    The candidates appeared in Houston on a live, two-hour segment of William F. Buckley's &quot;Firing Line&quot; show that is broadcast on more than 250 public-television stations.    Generally, it was a good-natured affair, with each candidate scoring points and no candidate emerging as a loser, but with Mr. Bush putting on a strong performance despite predictions that he would fare poorly in the candidates' first showdown. The Republicans seemed more at ease with each other and more familiar with many of the issues than did the Democrats who gathered in a similar format in July.    The Republican debate was played out in the shadow of Mr. Reagan, but in the aftermath of the stock-market crash, there were surprisingly few bows to the president's accomplishments. Each of the six candidates attempted to use the debate to stake out a distinctive position.    Mr. Bush stressed his loyalty to President Reagan, refusing to detail his policy differences with the president. &quot;I'm not going to go down and fine-tune differences with President Reagan,&quot; he said. &quot;I've taken several shots on that. . . . But in our family, loyalty is a strength, not a character flaw.&quot;    The audience, in Mr. Bush's home town, clearly was on his side.    Mr. Dole sought to portray himself as a Senate leader who has been down in the trenches fighting for Mr. Reagan's programs.    Mr. Kemp held firmly to his anti-tax, supply-side credo and reminded viewers that unlike Mr. Bush, he campaigned for Mr. Reagan, &quot;not against him,&quot; in 1980 -- the campaign in which Mr. Bush described the supply-side doctrine as &quot;voodoo economics.&quot;    Mr. du Pont, with little to lose and much to gain, not only attacked his bigname opponents but reeled off some of his controversial domestic programs that haven't been endorsed by any of the other candidates, including his plan to overhaul Social Security. &quot;That may be a new idea,&quot; Mr. Bush said, &quot;but it's a dumb one.&quot;    Mr. Haig sharply differed with Mr. Reagan, whom he served as secretary of state, saying that President Eisenhower never &quot;brutalized&quot; his secretaries of state. He said the administration has &quot;several questions today to answer to the American people,&quot; including the budget deficit.    Mr. Robertson, an evangelical minister, sought to portray himself as a businessman and educator and took the strongest conservative stand on social issues. </TEXT></DOC>
