Until a rule is adopted addressing mechanisms for fish and wildlife agenciesto appeal license orders when they have not previously intervened in theproceeding, it will be the Commission's policy to allow a fish and wildlifeagency to intervene in a licensing proceeding within 30 days after Commissionstaff has issued an order rejecting or materially modifying any of thefish and wildlife agency's recommendations submitted pursuant to the Fishand Wildlife Coordination Act, for the limited purpose of appealing suchrejection or material modification. The intervention petition must be accompaniedby the appeal. This policy will provide fish and wildlife agencies a chanceto participate at the appeal stage of a proceeding without requiring themto intervene in those proceedings where a reason to appeal may never arise.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>EFFECTIVE DATE: </T2>This statement of policy is effective February17, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2>Jessica Seigel, Office of theGeneral Counsel, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North CapitolStreet NE., Washington, DC 20426, (202) 357-5775.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>In addition to publishing the fulltext of this document in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>, the Commission also provides all interestedpersons an opportunity to inspect or copy the contents of this documentduring normal business hours in Room 1000 at the Commission's Headquarters,825 North Capitol Street NE., Washington, DC 20426.The Commission Issuance Posting System (CIPS), an electronic bulletin boardservice, provides access to the texts of formal documents issued by theCommission.

Hesse, Chairman; Charles G. Stalon,Charles A. Tradbandt, Elizabeth Anne Moler and Jerry J. Langdon.</ITAG>The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (Commission) has instructed staffto prepare a notice of proposed rulemaking (NOPR) on the conflict resolutionprocedures prescribed by section 10(j) of the Federal Power Act (FPA),as amended by section 3(a) of the Electric Consumers Protection Act of1986 (ECPA).\1\<NOTE/> One of the matters that the NOPR will address is mechanismsfor fish and wildlife agencies to appeal license orders when they havenot previously intervened in the proceeding. Until a rule resolving thismatter is adopted, the Commission is establishing a policy to permit certainappeals by fish and wildlife agencies that have not previously interveneda proceeding.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ 16 U.S.C. 803(j) (1982).Section 10(j) of the FPA requires hydroelectric licenses issued under theFPA to include conditions, based on recommendations submitted pursuantto the Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act by state and federal fish andwildlife agencies, for the protection, mitigation, and enhancement of fishand wildlife (including related spawning grounds and habitat). Wheneverthe Commission believes that a fish and wildlife agency's recommendationsmay be inconsistent with the purposes and requirements of applicable law,section 10(j)(2) requires that it attempt to resolve such inconsistency.If the inconsistency cannot be resolved and the Commission does not adoptthe agency's recommendation, section 10(j)(2) requires it to publish findingsthat adoption of such recommendation is inconsistent with the purposesand requirements of applicable law and that the conditions selected bythe Commission will adequately and equitably protect, mitigate damage to,and enhance fish and wildlife affected by the project. This is done inthe licensing order.The percentage of proceedings in which an agency's recommendations areheld to be inconsistent with applicable law is exceedingly small. However,where a license is issued by the staff pursuant to delegated authorityand a fish and wildlife agency is not a party, it will not be able to ensurethat the Commission itself will review rejection of one or more of itsrecommendations. In order that the agencies will not have to intervenein every licensing proceeding so as to preserve their right of appeal tothe Commission itself in such an instance, it will be the Commission'spolicy to allow a fish and wildlife agency to intervene in such a proceedingwithin 30 days after the issuance by staff pursuant to delegated authorityof an order rejecting or materially modifying any of its fish and wildliferecommendations, for the limited purpose of permitting that agency to appealsuch action to the Commission itself. The agency's intervention and appealmust be filed simultaneously.We believe the establishment of this policy provides a practical way toallow fish and wildlife agencies, who have an important statutory rolein the licensing process, to participate at the appeal stage of a proceeding,without requiring them to intervene in a large number of proceedings wherethe necessity for appeal may never arise.<ITAG tagnum="84">Effective Date</ITAG>The Administrative Procedure Act exempts statements of policy from boththe notice and comment requirements of section 4(b) of the AdministrativeProcedure Act \2\<NOTE/> and the requirement that publication be made 30 days beforethe effective date of the rule.\3\<NOTE/> Therefore, this statement of policy is effective February17, 1989.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ 5 U.S.C. 553(b) (1982).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ 5 U.S.C. 553(d) (1982).<ITAG tagnum="21">By the Commission, Commissioner Trabandt concurred with a separatestatement attached.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Lois D. Cashell,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Secretary.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="20">TRABANDT, Commissioner, </ITAG><T3>Concurring:</T3><ITAG tagnum="21">I have publicly stated that a proposed rulemaking on the conflictresolution procedures prescribed by andSection; 10(j) of the Federal PowerAct, and the instant policy statement are both unnecessary and inappropriate,because current Commission practice (1) is completely consistent with thelegislative history of the Conference Report enacted by Congress, and (2)implements dispute resolution in an effective and efficient manner forthe mutual benefit of license applicants and fish and wildlife resources.However, my colleagues have decided to instruct staff to prepare a noticeof proposed rulemaking on the conflict resolution procedures prescribedby andSection; 10(j), and address in that proposed rule mechanisms for fishand wildlife agencies to appeal license orders when they have not previouslyintervened in the proceeding.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">I remain seriously concerned that any parties be granted special administrativeprocedural rights not established expressly by statute, as would be thecase here. I do not consider the enactment of andSection; 10(j) by the ElectricConsumers Protection Act of 1986, Pub. L. No. 99-495, 100 Stat. 1243 (Oct.16, 1986) to constitute express statutory direction that fish and wildlifeagencies be granted automatically late intervention, particularly aftera license has been issued. A better course of action would be to requirethe Commission staff to notify such agencies of any decision to modifytheir recommendations in the 10(j) process and provide a period of 30 daysthereafter for late intervention before a license issued. The majorityhere has created inadvertently a conditional license whenever a recommendationof a fish or wildlife agency is not adopted without modification in the10(j) process. In my judgment, that result is not consistent with the FederalPower Act nor the Congressional intent of ECPA.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Nevertheless, the majority deems it important to ensure the rightof intervention under such circumstances and, in any event, this issuewill be considered further in the rulemaking process. Therefore, as aninterim measure, I reluctantly concur with this policy determination.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Charles A.
