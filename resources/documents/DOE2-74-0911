Analysis of track laying inmines in the USSR shows that about 200 km of track are laid annually,with energy at 1600 kJ/m expended in the form of manual labor. The KD-1equipment, developed by VNIIOMShS, is based on a track delivery containerholding 10-12 rails 8-12 m long. The NPSh-900 set is a set of tools andaccessories for track laying - a rail cutting unit, a rail drilling unit,a rail bender, ballast cars, grips, jacks, etc. All this equipment ishanded to the track laying site on a special rail/wheeled trolley. Bothsets of equipment have been successfully tested in Donbass mines.</TEXT></DOC>
