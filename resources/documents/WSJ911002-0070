U.S. District Judge Barefoot Sanders threw out the suitagainst Ernst andamp; Young, concluding that Western's sole ownerand top officer, Jarrett E. Woods Jr., knew about thethrift's poor financial condition. A more accurate audit byErnst andamp; Young's predecessor firm, Arthur Young andamp; Co.,probably wouldn't have affected the actions of the thrift'sofficers and directors, he said.</LP><TEXT>   Thus, the judge ruled, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.couldn't claim that Western's officers and directors reliedon the auditor's negligent work or that the thrift was harmedby it.   If the decision survives an appeal, some lawyers say,other regulators' suits against accounting firms could bederailed. &quot;It clearly could have far-reaching effects,&quot; saida New York lawyer involved in litigation with the FDIC, whoasked not to be identified.   John Thomas, associate general counsel of the FDIC, saidthe insurer of bank and thrift deposits was &quot;surprised anddisappointed&quot; by the ruling. He said the agency isconsidering filing a motion asking for reconsideration of theruling or appealing. The FDIC has about 40 suits pendingagainst accounting firms related to failed banks and thrifts,and several could be affected by the ruling, Mr. Thomas said.   The FDIC sued Ernst andamp; Young and Arthur Young in March 1990for $560 million in damages in a highly publicized suit. TheFDIC charged that the auditors should have recognized a raftof lending improprieties at Western during audits for 1984and 1985. Arthur Young merged with Ernst andamp; Whinney in 1989 toform Ernst andamp; Young.   Some lawyers familiar with the decision said it couldapply to other thrifts, especially in situations where oneperson or a small group of people controlled the thrift'sactivities. &quot;If officers and directors knew everything thatauditors should have figured out, then you have a questionwhether a {better} audit would have changed anything,&quot; onelawyer said.   The decision is expected to have less of an effect onthrifts owned by publicly held companies, such as LincolnSavings andamp; Loan Association, which Arthur Young also audited.&quot;Usually, at least some directors didn't know how bad itwas,&quot; and might have blown the whistle if the audit hadrevealed irregularities, the lawyer said.   An Ernst andamp; Young spokesman said the firm is &quot;very pleasedwith the decision.&quot;   ---   BANKRUPTCY JUDGE APPROVES Myerson andamp; Kuhn reorganizationplan.   The high-profile New York law firm of Myerson andamp; Kuhn filedfor bankruptcy-court protection in December 1989. Forty-threeof the law firm's 51 partners have agreed to contribute atotal of $3.9 million to pay off creditors, said RonaldCohen, who represents the law firm in the bankruptcyproceedings. Under the terms of the plan, which U.S.bankruptcy Judge Prudence Beatty Abram approved yesterday,the law firm's creditors will receive about 22 cents on thedollar.   Mr. Cohen, a partner with the New York law firm Seward andamp;Kissel, said the largest contribution will come from BowieKuhn, a former Myerson andamp; Kuhn partner and commissioner ofbaseball, but he would not reveal the exact amount. Eachpartner negotiated a settlement that ranges from 50 to 100%of the partner's net worth, Mr. Cohen said.   The law firm's other senior partner, Harvey Myerson, hasnot agreed to contribute to the plan, Mr. Cohen said. NeitherMr. Myerson nor his attorney could be reached for comment.Mr. Myerson has been indicted on federal fraud andracketeering charges. His trial is scheduled to begin inFebruary.   Mr. Cohen said the plan was negotiated after the partnersagreed to contribute and assist the bankruptcy administratorcollect another $3 million in receivables outstanding. Inreturn, the judge agreed to protect the partners whocontribute from additional suits against them individually.   Mr. Cohen said he believed the plan approved by JudgeAbram marked the first time that members of a partnership inbankruptcy have been accorded protection from future suitsfiled by creditors against them as individuals.   ---   JOHNSON andamp; JOHNSON LOSES suit alleging that Tums ads weremisleading.   In a suit filed earlier this year, Johnson andamp; Johnsonaccused the manufacturer of Tums, SmithKline Beecham Corp.,of making false claims about Tums's health benefits andunfairly disparaging Jandamp;J's Mylanta antacid. The suit sought acourt order barring the Tums commercials, which touted Tums'scalcium content and stated that Mylanta contained aluminum.   But Judge Miriam Goldman Cedarbaum, in federal court inManhattan, dismissed the suit, ruling that the commercialsweren't misleading or false. She said that while the impactof taking Tums for its calcium may be so small that it isn'tmeasurable, Jandamp;J hadn't proved that the amount of calciumwould have no health benefit at all. SmithKline is a unit ofSmithKline Beecham PLC of London.   The judge also ruled that while the commercials point outthat Mylanta contains aluminum, the ads don't allege that theingredient is dangerous. The judge said any worries usershave over aluminum stem from other sources. Although somescientific reports have raised questions about health risksrelated to aluminum, the judge said, it is approved byregulators as an antacid ingredient.   A spokesman for Jandamp;J said the company is disappointed withthe ruling and is considering whether to appeal.   At trial, a Jandamp;J executive testified that the company isplanning a calcium-based Mylanta in response to concernsabout aluminum.   ---   PARTNER IN SWEDISH law firm moves to Skadden Arps.
