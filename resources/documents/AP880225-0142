(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A former firefighter admitted setting aseries of arson fires that burned a small town's elementary schooland two churches that opened their doors to students, a prosecutorsaid today.   Adrian Julius Howe, 23, of Omak will be charged with six countsof first-degree arson, prosecutor Jack Burchard said. He was heldin the Okanogan County Jail.   Howe admitted setting the fires, which caused $6.5 million indamage, Burchard said. Each arson count carries a possible sentenceof life imprisonment and a $50,000 fine.   Officials declined to comment on reports that Howe held a grudgeagainst the burned school, North Omak Elementary School.   The six fires that began in December and hit the school twice ineight days led to the creation of a 12-member arson task force anddoor-to-door canvassing in search of leads. Two churches and achurch house were also burned; one of the churches was struck twice.   Howe was arrested Wednesday, said Mimi Curry of the stateDepartment of Community Development's division of fire protectionservices, who has been appointed spokeswoman for the investigation.   The task force, set up Tuesday and composed of local, state andU.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms agents, was ``at apeak of activity,'' with investigators going door-to-door, Ms.Curry said.   The string of arsons terrorized Omak, a placid north-centralWashington town of 4,000. Churches and schools stepped up security,and residents formed night-time patrols.   Howe's mother, Lena Howe, 67, said she and her 75-year-oldhusband, Ben, adopted their son at age 2. He had learningdifficulties and left Omak High School in his junior year, themother told The Spokesman-Review in today's editions of the Spokanenewspaper.   Howe later got a job on the fire patrol in nearby Nespelem, butwas not rehired after he lost his driver's license because ofdrinking problems, Mrs. Howe said. He now works at a lumber mill onthe Colville Indian reservation, just east of Omak, Mrs. Howe said.   Colville Indian Reservation tribal chief Harry Smiskin said Howewas a firefighter for the U.S. Bureau of Indian Affairs' firecontrol department. He said he gave details of Howe's employment toinvestigators.   The Washington state House voted Wednesday night to include inits $207 million supplemental state budget a $150,000 appropriationto help Omak and Okanogan County pay for investigation of theblazes.   If fully approved, the money would be used for administrativecosts to complete the arson investigation, Ms. Curry said.   ``The (Okanogan) county budget is being quickly depleted,'' shesaid. ``After all, they (county commissioners) didn't plan for this(the arson fires) to happen.''</TEXT></DOC>
