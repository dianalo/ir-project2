Lt. Gen. Herbert R. Temple Jr., chief of the bureau, said thereview was conducted by a team led by Brig. Gen. John H. McDonaldof Delaware Army National Guard at the request of Sen. Sam Nunn,D-Ga., chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, and Sen.John Warner, R-Va.   He said the reviewers found no evidence to support contentionsthat delays in deployment of the Guard on the morning of Sept. 3contributed to the damage from looting and vandalism.   The study showed that alert and call-up procedures ``workedremarkably well considering the number of troops mobilized anddeployed, the short time period that elapsed between initial alertand actual deployment, and the fact that it took place in themiddle of America's busiest summer holiday weekend.''   Temple said no instance of physical abuse by a National Guardmember had been verified during the disturbances Sept. 1-5. He saidseveral members of the Guard received minor injuries, but nonerequired hospitalization.</TEXT></DOC>
