Separately, officials in London said the Bank of England's underlying reserves fell $230 million in June. The drop, which private analysts hadn't been expecting, apparently reflected intervention by the British central bank to support the pound after the Conservative Party government's election victory June 11.    Foreign exchange dealers said the dollar's gains yesterday resulted in part from comments by Bank of Japan Governor Satoshi Sumita that he believes the U.S. Federal Reserve has been actively trying to prevent a further dollar decline and that the Bank of Japan will stay in close touch with other central banks to secure exchange-rate stability. Mr. Sumita didn't elaborate on his remarks about the Fed's actions.    In late New York trading, the U.S. currency stood at 147.50 yen, up 0.5% from 146.80 late Wednesday. Volume remained light ahead of the Fourth of July holiday weekend.    In early trading today in Tokyo, the dollar was quoted at 147.52 yen.    &quot;There was nothing much to point to other than Mr. Sumita's comments,&quot; Charles A. Spence, vice president, foreign exchange, at First Interstate Bank of California, Los Angeles, said. &quot;That's what kept the dollar firming.&quot;    Mr. Sumita also told a Tokyo luncheon gathering that recent exchange-rate movements indicate that confidence in the dollar's strength has been recovering &quot;to a certain extent.&quot; He said a further decline in the currency would work against continued economic expansion in Japan, Europe and the U.S.    The central banker also said Japanese investment in U.S. securities has been showing renewed growth and said expectations of a further fall by the dollar are receding.    In other trading yesterday, the dollar firmed against most other major currencies. It advanced 0.3% to 1.8329 West German marks from 1.8278, and the British pound eased marginally to $1.6169 from $1.6170.    The drop in British reserves appeared to have little impact on the market. Government officials said the Bank of England's actions last month to support the pound didn't represent any policy change. They said the British central bank intervened to smooth sterling's decline when an expected heavy flow of foreign funds into Britain failed to materialize after Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's election victory.    The decline in the underlying reserves contrasted with several private analysts' expectations of about a $500 million gain in June. It also followed three months of increases totaling nearly $9.5 billion in the country's underlying gold and foreign-currency reserves. Figures on underlying reserves exclude any foreign-currency activities by public entities such as local governments or nationalized industries.    Although Britain's Treasury says changes in underlying reserves shouldn't be viewed as indicating central bank intervention, analysts still regard the figures as a general guide to the scale of Bank of England activity in the currency markets. The nation's Treasury also said yesterday that unadjusted reserves fell $315 million last month to $34.4 billion.    On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery fell 60 cents an ounce to $446.30 in moderate trading. Estimated volume was 3.2 million ounces.    Gold was quoted at $446.95 an ounce in early trading today in Hong Kong.    ---              LATE NEW YORK TRADING              Thursday, July 2, 1987   Based on average of late afternoon buying and sellingrates.
