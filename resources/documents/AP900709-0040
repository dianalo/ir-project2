One Hezbollah fighter was killed and 11 people _ five combatantsand six civilians _ were wounded in the raid, said a policespokesman, who cannot be named under standing rules.   In two runs spaced over 10 minutes, four F-4 fighter-bombersrocked the bases in the villages of Loweizeh and Melita _ which aretwo miles north of Sunday's targets.   It was Israel's third raid on targets in Lebanon in four daysand 15th this year. Police said leaping flames and palls of blacksmoke hung over the targets in Iqlim al-Tuffah, or the appleregion, southeast of the port city of Sidon.   In Jerusalem, the Israeli military said the targets, 15 milesnorth of the border, were bases for ``organizing and launchingattacks'' against Israel.   It said all its planes had returned safely, but gave no otherdetails.   Both Loweizeh and Melita are traditional strongholds ofHezbollah, or Party of God, and overlook the northern flank ofIsrael's self-declared security zone.   Hezbollah confirmed the new strikes in a statement issued inBeirut and said they were followed by massive artillery bombardmentof the two villages from Israeli positions in the security zone.   After Sunday's raid, Hezbollah fighters fired threesurface-to-surface missiles toward northern Israel.   Early today, Israeli artillery hammered suspected guerrillahideouts in the foothills of Mount Hermon.   Military helicopters illuminated the rugged mountain slopes withparachute flares as long-range guns on the Israeli border poundedthe villages of Ein Atta and Kfeir in southeastern Lebanon beforedawn, police said.   In Sunday's raid, Israeli warplanes destroyed a Hezbollahsnipers' nest and ammunition depot on a hilltop between thevillages of Jarjou and Ein Bouswar.   Police said at least three people were killed and 12 wounded inSunday's raid. That raised the overall toll of Israeli air strikesthis year to 19 dead and 51 injured, excluding today's raid.   The raids followed word from Iran's official news agencySaturday that one of the 16 Western hostages in Lebanon, probably aEuropean, might soon be freed. Hezbollah is the umbrella group forfactions believed holding most of the hostages.   ``Let us pray the Israeli attacks will not scuttle efforts tofree one of the hostages,'' said a Shiite source close toHezbollah's Iranian-backed leadership.   ``The hostage-holders are definitely restless, but I personallybelieve Iran's pressure will probably override the impact of theattacks,'' the source said, speaking on condition of anonymity.   Shiite fundamentalists accuse Western governments of bias towardIsrael and hold them responsible for its actions against the Arabs.   Jarjou and Ein Bouswar are two to three miles north of Israel'ssecurity zone. Hezbollah has long been engaged in guerrilla attackson Israeli troops and allied Lebanese Christian militiamen policingthe zone.   The zone's population is predominantly Shiite Moslem. Israelcarved out the buffer area in 1985, saying it was needed to guardagainst cross-border raids.   Israeli jets on Friday attacked bases of radical Palestinianguerrillas in Syrian-policed northern and eastern Lebanon. Eightfighters were wounded.</TEXT></DOC>
