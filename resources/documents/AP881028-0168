The fine, the largest against a single employer in the agency's17-year history, reflects what Assistant Labor Secretary John A.Pendergrass called ``an employer who knew about a serious healthhazard, saw the tragic toll on its workers and chose to ignore it.''   Morrell, the nation's fifth largest meatpacker, said it wouldseek an injunction on Monday in U.S. District Court in Sioux Falls``to stop OSHA from singling us out for penalties ... for what isclearly a national, multi-industry safety and health problem.''   Pendergrass, however, said an OSHA inspection of the giant plantbegun six months ago uncovered ``the worst conditions we've found inany industry to date.''   Morrell Chairman Milton J. Schloss called the fine ``grosslyunfair and totally unjustified.''   ``This is guilt by headline,'' Schloss said from the company'sheadquarters in Cincinnati. ``It clearly is unfair for OSHA tosingle us out and demand we do more when we already are leading theindustry in this effort.''   The fines all stem from what is increasingly recognized ascumulative trauma disorders such as carpal tunnel syndrome andtendinitis in which joints become incapable of movement because ofrepeated hand, wrist and arm motions that wear away soft tissueprotecting them.   OSHA has levied fines in the past against companies that ignorethe disorder _ including some against auto producers and a $3.1million penalty against another meatpacker, IBP Corp., last May.   IBP, the nation's second largest meatpacker, has appealed itsfine, which stemmed from working conditions that the agency found atits Dakota City, Neb., plant.   But nowhere, OSHA officials said Friday, have governmentinvestigators found such widespread evidence of the disorders andsuch willful disregard for those injured as at Morrell's Sioux Fallsplant.   From May 1987 to May 1988, more than 800 of the 2,000 workers atthe plant sustained ``serious and sometimes disabling injuries,''OSHA said.   And some departments in the plant had incidence rates of 75injured workers for every 100 full-time employees.   The government said Morrell's rate of injuries was nine times theaverage for the meatpacking industry _ the most hazardous in thecountry, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics _ and 652 timesthe rate of job injuries for businesses in general.   Of the 817 Morrell workers at Sioux Falls, 93 percent received notime off and 39 percent were denied lighter duty needed for healing,OSHA said.   Sixty-three Morrell workers who underwent surgery received anaverage of only 1.1 days off, compared with 30 days to 60 daysrecommended by the National Institute of Occupational Safety andHealth for recovery before returning to the job.   OSHA said it found 27 workers who underwent surgery who receivedno time off.   ``There were indications that recommendations of physicians weretotally ignored,'' Pendergrass said.   Friday's action was the latest in a string of fines leviedagainst the Sioux Falls plant. From 1984 through September, Morrellhas been fined six times by the agency for a total of $758,910 forviolations at the facility.   Frank White, OSHA's top enforcement officer, said Morrell hadhired ergonomists _ experts in designing work stations to avoidstress and trauma _ in 1986 and last April to study the problem.   But, White added, ``We have no clear evidence at this point thatany changes have been made.'' He added, however, the governmentinspectors have not been inside the plant in recent months.   Schloss cited a ruling by a Labor Department law judge last weekdismissing a $690,100 fined assessed against the company in April1987 for what OSHA called deliberate falsification of its health andsafety records.   The law judge, James. A. Cronin Jr., said OSHA had missed asix-month statute of limitations for writing the citations from thetime that the agency first told the company that it wanted toinspect the records.   Morrell said in a statement that ``union work rules and thegrievance process have often been used to block'' changes inworkers' routines designed to alleviate the problems ofrepetitive-motion duties.   But Al Zack, a spokesman for the United Food and CommercialWorkers that represents the Morrell employees, said the rotationsystem Morrell cited was proposed and rejected five years go.   ``It was a cost-cutting scheme to cut wages and had absolutelynothing to do with safety,'' Zack said.   Previously, the largest fine assessed against one employer was a$4.11 million levy in 1987 against Bath Iron Works of Maine,primarily for construction safety violations.   OSHA and the company last week agreed to a $650,000 settlement,with Bath Iron Works agreeing to institute a company-wide program toend the dangerous conditions and finance health and safety research.</TEXT></DOC>
