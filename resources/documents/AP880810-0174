John C. Keeney, a deputy attorney general in the department'sCriminal Division said the proposed changes ``would be disastrous''to government anti-racketeering suits against unions, such as thecase filed in June against the International Brotherhood ofTeamsters.   Keeney testified before a House Judiciary subcommittee that isconsidering legislation to change the rules for civil actions filedunder the Racketeer-Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, knownas RICO.   The law allows the government and private plaintiffs to filesuits alleging corrupt business practices and racketeering.Originally intended for suits against organized crime, the law hasbeen used _ some say abused _ as a weapon by private plaintiffs tostrike at their competitors.   With its provisions for treble damages, critics say the law hasprovided unnecessary windfalls to plaintiffs.   Legislation in both houses of Congress would sharply curtail thetreble damage provisions, although suits filed by the governmentcould still seek that penalty.   While the Teamsters suit was the first time the JusticeDepartment sought a trustee to run an international union, it hasfiled numerous suits to place union locals under trusteeships.   Keeney told the subcommittee on criminal justice:   ``These provisions would set strict limits on the purposes forwhich trustees could be imposed ... and would set an 18-month limiton the duration of a trusteeship, unless the trustee could satisfya burden to justify one or more six-month extensions.''   He said such provisions are unworkable and were adapted fromfederal labor law that applies to trusteeships imposed by labororganizations on their subordinate unions.   ``Those laws were designed to protect against arbitrary orimproper trusteeships imposed without due process of law,'' Keeneysaid.   ``Such limitations are not needed, and have no place, in thecontext of a trusteeship imposed by a federal district court afterfull hearings for all parties in order to correct abuses within theorganization.''   Keeney said the only permissible purpose for seeking atrusteeship under the House legislation would be to correctcorruption or financial malpractice, to restore democraticprocedures or to carry out legitimate objectives of the labororganization.   ``These purposes are too narrow,'' Keeney said. ``For example,if the union were being used for clearly criminal ends outside thecontext of international labor union affairs _ such as traffickingin illegal drugs _ the purposes stated in the bill would probablynot apply, and a trusteeship could not be imposed ....''   He added that the restrictions on the duration of a trusteeship``would make it very burdensome for a trustee to perform his dutieseffectively, as is evident from our experience'' in at least onecase where a union local has had a trustee for more than two years.</TEXT></DOC>
