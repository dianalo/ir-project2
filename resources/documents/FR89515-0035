The assessment provides a basisfor the conclusion that the field testing of these genetically engineeredpotato plants will not present a risk of introduction or disseminationof a plant pest and will not have any significant impact on the qualityof the human environment. Based upon this finding of no significant impact,the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that an environmentalimpact statement need not be prepared.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESS: </T2>Copies of the environmental assessment and finding ofno significant impact are available for public inspection at Biotechnology,Biologics, and Environmental Protection, Animal and Plant Health InspectionService, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Room 850, Federal Building, 6505Belcrest Road, Hyattsville, MD 20782.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: </T2>Dr. James White, Biotechnologist,Biotechnology Permit Unit, Biotechnology, Biologics, and EnvironmentalProtection, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, U.S. Departmentof Agriculture, Room 844, Federal Building, 6505 Belcrest Road, Hyattsville,MD 20782, (301) 436-5940.

A permit must be obtainedbefore a regulated article can be introduced in the United States. Theregulations set forth procedures for obtaining a limited permit for theimportation or interstate movement of a regulated article and for obtaininga permit for the release into the environment of a regulated article. TheAnimal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) has stated that it wouldprepare an environmental assessment and, when necessary, an environmentalimpact statement before issuing a permit for the release into the environmentof a regulated article (see 52 FR 22906).Monsanto Agricultural Company, St. Louis, Missouri, has submitted an applicationfor a permit for release into the environment, to field test geneticallyengineered potato plants modified to express the coat protein genes ofpotato virus X and potato virus Y or the coat protein gene of potato leafrollvirus.In the course of reviewing the permit application, APHIS assessed the impacton the environment of releasing the potato plant under the conditions describedin the Monsanto Agricultural Company application. APHIS concluded thatthe field testing will not present a risk of plant pest introduction ordissemination and will not have any significant impact on the quality ofthe human environment.The environmental assessment and finding of no significant impact, whichare based on data submitted by Monsanto, as well as a review of other relevantliterature, provide the public with documentation of APHIS' review andanalysis of the environmental impacts associated with conducting the fieldtesting.The facts supporting APHIS's finding of no significant impact are summarizedbelow and are contained in the environmental assessment.1. Genes encoding the viral coat proteins of potato virus X and potatovirus Y or potato leafroll virus have been inserted into the potato chromosome.In nature, chromosomal genetic material can only be transferred to othersexually compatible plants by cross-pollination. In this field trial, theintroduced gene cannot spread to other plants by cross-pollination becausethe potato plants are sterile.2. Neither the viral coat protein genes themselves, nor their gene products,confer on potato any plant pest characteristics. Traits that lead to weedinessin plants are polygenic traits and cannot be conferred by adding a singlegene.3. The expression of the viral coat protein genes does not provide thetransformed potato plants with any measurable selective advantage overnontransformed potato in their ability to be disseminated or to becomeestablished in the environment.4. The vector used to transfer the plant viral genes to the potato plantshas been evaluated for its use in this specific experiment and does notpose a plant pest risk in this experiment. The vector, although derivedfrom a DNA sequence with known plant pest potential, has been disarmed;that is, genes that are necessary for producing plant disease have beendeleted from the vector. The vector has been tested and shown to be nonpathogenicto any susceptible plant.5. The vector agent, the bacterium that was used to deliver that vectorDNA and the plant viral coat protein genes into the plant cell, has beenshown to be eliminated and no longer associated with the transformed potatoplants.6. Horizontal movement of the introduced gene is not possible. The vectoracts by delivering the gene to the plant genome (i.e., chromosomal DNA).The vector does not survive in the plants.7. The field test site is small (less than 0.4 acre) and physically isolatedby a surrounding area of cultivated land.The environmental assessment and finding of no significant impact havebeen prepared in accordance with: (1) The National Environmental PolicyAct of 1969 (NEPA) (42 U.S.C. 4331 <T3>et seq.</T3>), (2) Regulations of the Council on Environmental Qualityfor Implementing the Procedural Provisions of NEPA (40 CFR Parts 1500-1509),(3) USDA Regulations Implementing NEPA (7 CFR Part 1b), and (4) APHIS GuidelinesImplementing NEPA (44 FR 50381-50384, August 28, 1979, and 44 FR 51272-51274,August 31, 1979).<ITAG tagnum="21">Done at Washington, DC, this 9th day of May 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">James W.
