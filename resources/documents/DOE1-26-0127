Current research sponsored by the Departmentof Energy at Argonne National Laboratory is directed toward gaining animproved understanding of the basic thermokinetic mechanisms associatedwith the pyrolytic conversion of MSW. Results from nonisothermal andisothermal bench-scale experiments of some MSW components are presented.Feedstocks included not only individual components but also mixturesof components. The effects of heating rate and sample size on overalldegradation and product formation over the temperature range 300-475{sup0}C are discussed. Some preliminary higher-temperature runs (up to 700{sup0}C) were completed in preparation for future work in the gasificationregime. Work also continued on the characterization of the liquids producedduring the pyrolysis process. 32 refs., 24 figs., 16 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
