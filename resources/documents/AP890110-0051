(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A ``sordid chapter'' in Alabama historyended when four former Ku Klux Klansmen pleaded guilty for theirpart in a decade-old clash with black marchers that wounded ninepeople, a federal judge said.   The four were the last of nine former Klansmen who were indictedand eventually pleaded guilty to charges stemming from the gunfirethat turned the Decatur parade route into a racial battleground.   No one was killed in the May 26, 1979, confrontation. Five policeofficers, two marchers and two Klansmen were wounded.   The Klansmen were trying to block a Southern Christian LeadershipConference march protesting the prosecution of a mentally retardedblack man charged with raping a white woman in Decatur.   Ray Winford Steele and William Riccio pleaded guilty Monday tofelony obstruction of justice, which carries a maximum penalty offive years in prison and a $10,000 fine, and a misdemeanor count ofconspiring to violate civil rights.   William Johnny Mason and Lynwood White pleaded guilty to themisdemeanor, which carries a maximum one year prison term and $1,000fine.   ``You have ended a very sordid chapter of your history and thehistory of this state,'' U.S. District Judge John Hancock said inaccepting the pleas. He delayed sentencing for up to a month.   In return for the pleas, federal prosecutors agreed to drop othercharges alleging that Klansmen aided and abetted in an injury to apolice officer.   Mason, White and Steele entered their pleas before the start ofthe trial Monday. Riccio indicated he wanted his trial to proceed,but pleaded guilty before a jury was picked.   His attorney, Jerry Quick, said Riccio wanted to end the case.   ``He is just glad it's over with,'' Quick said, adding he hopedthe judge would be lenient.   Al Moskowitz, a Justice Department attorney overseeing theprosecution, said he was confident there would have been convictionshad the cases gone to trial. But he said he agreed to the pleaarrangement in part to let the case finally come to rest.   The case was broken open when the Montgomery-based SouthernPoverty Law Center sued the Klan. That litigation produced testimonyfrom former Klansmen against Klan colleagues, leading to a federalgrand jury indictment against the nine on criminal charges.   Their trial was delayed after a federal judge ruled that thetestimony produced in the civil case could not be used in thecriminal case. But that ruling was set aside on appeal.</TEXT></DOC>
