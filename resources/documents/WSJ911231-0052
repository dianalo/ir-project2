He said the favorable supplyconditions result from two factors: a slower-than-expectedworld economy and a quicker-than-expected recovery inKuwait's oil production capacity.</LP><TEXT>   In addition, he noted that Iraqi production could comeback on line if that nation agreed to the terms establishedby the United Nations for selling the oil.   Although oil currently sells for about $19 a barrel, Mr.Moore said the department expects a price of about $24 abarrel in inflation-adjusted terms.   He also said that disruptions in the former Soviet Union'soil production aren't expected to last very long. &quot;The Sovietsituation is tumultuous,&quot; said Mr. Moore, but added, &quot;we haveevery indication it will not be permanent.&quot;   The deputy secretary suggested that he expects oilproduction from the former Soviet states to pick up after themiddle of 1992, when the U.S. hosts a conference in Russiafor private oil companies.   Mr. Moore also announced that he will head a delegation toKuwait, Saudi Arabia and other Middle Eastern nations tomaintain and promote U.S. exports of oil field services andtechnology. The trip also is partly intended to show U.S.appreciation for those nations' support during the PersianGulf War.   A number of issues will be discussed during the two-weektour, Mr. Moore said, among them the U.S. national energystrategy and tentative proposals to lease rather than buy oilfor the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Leasing wouldenable the U.S. to fill the reserve at a low cost, then pay aprearranged additional amount to the oil providers when theoil is actually used.   The deputy secretary portrayed the trip as part of alarger effort by the Bush administration to preserve andexpand U.S. exports of services and technology to the oilindustry. One aim would be to counter recent efforts byGermany and others to expand their Middle Eastern markets.   The Kuwaiti market hasn't been a problem for the U.S., but&quot;you can't take your markets for granted,&quot; said Mr. Moore.&quot;There is a concern we might begin to lose market share inthat part of the world.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
