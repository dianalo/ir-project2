The court said it rejected the refund policy because the agency doesn't allow the companies to compensate for earnings that fall below the allowed level.    The ruling is a victory for American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co. and the regional Bell companies because it opens the way for them to request rate increases should their earnings fall below approved levels. But it also could turn out to be a political plus for the FCC, which has proposed junking traditional regulation of telephone-company profit margins and setting &quot;caps&quot; on prices instead.    &quot;It will give a significant added boost to the price cap plan,&quot; said Albert Halprin, former chief of the FCC's common carrier bureau. Mr. Halprin said the ruling could diminish the political appeal of traditional profit-margin regulation because it demonstrates that such regulation can't be counted on only to reduce rates, but might result in increased charges as well.    The FCC currently regulates the rates a company may charge for interstate telecommunications services by allowing it to recover its expenses plus an authorized return on its capital expenditures. Under a policy adopted in 1985, the agency has required refunds when a company earns somewhat more than its authorized rate of return, but hasn't allowed a company to recoup funds when profit falls below approved levels.    &quot;The refund rule would operate over the long run to put a carrier out of business,&quot; said an opinion for the three-judge panel. The court returned the case, which was brought by ATandamp;T, to the FCC and said the agency could institute a more evenhanded approach.    The FCC, in a statement, said it was &quot;disappointed that the commission was reversed in its attempt to put some serious teeth into rate-of-return regulation.&quot; The agency didn't comment on whether the ruling would cancel any refunds the commission has ordered.    Mr. Halprin said he believed that some companies that had been required by the FCC to make refunds may be entitled to rate increases totaling &quot;tens of millions of dollars&quot; as a result of the ruling.    Gene Kimmelman, legislative director of the Consumer Federation of America, said he didn't see the ruling as justification for a rate cap. Mr. Kimmelman said the court was &quot;confused&quot; about the purpose of rate-of-return regulation. &quot;To earn less than rate of return is entirely appropriate when the company has failed to perform well in the marketplace,&quot; he said.    ATandamp;T said the ruling won't have any direct effect on its financial results because it didn't overearn during the 1985-86 period in which the FCC refund policy was in effect. Nor, said a spokesman, does ATandamp;T think that the ruling will affect refund policies of state commissions because the court didn't rule on the broad issue of refunds, but on the FCC's particular refund mechanism.    An ATandamp;T spokesman said that the company interprets the ruling to mean that the FCC may set a refund policy, but not one that prevents a carrier from recouping funds when earnings fall below the authorized profit level. &quot;All this says is the commission came up with a flawed refund policy,&quot; the spokesman said.    Many regional Bell companies could benefit substantially from the ruling if the telephone concerns are allowed to keep refunds.    Philadelphia-based Bell Atlantic Corp. has a refund obligation in excess of $30 million. Pacific Telesis Group, based in San Francisco, was expecting to repay $33.5 million. Chicago-based Ameritech and St. Louis-based Southwestern Bell Corp. must return $12 million and $32.6 million, respectively. BellSouth Corp., in Atlanta, must refund $16 million and Edgewood, Colo.-based U S West Inc. must pay back $37 million.    Communication Satellite Corp. also stands to gain. Last month the FCC ordered Washington-based Comsat, which provides transatlantic communications for international and maritime customers, to refund $38.8 million. Initially, the FCC had ordered Comsat to pay back $62 million.    The FCC actions resulted in the termination of a merger agreement between Comsat and Atlanta-based Contel Corp. Dismayed by a prospective weakening of Comsat's financial position, Contel withdrew from the merger agreement, which was proposed last September and had an indicated value of $2.47 million. </TEXT></DOC>
