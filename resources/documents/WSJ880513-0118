You might not know, for instance, that your tax dollars have gone to investigate what kind of booze turns sunfish into mean drunks. You would know that -- and a lot more -- if you had been paying attention to Sen. William Proxmire.    When it comes to sniffing out dubious Federal expenditures small and large, the Wisconsin Democrat long has been the taxpayer's champion in Congress. Each month for the past 13 years, he has bestowed his Golden Fleece Award on the U.S. agency that he believes most merits it for frivolous or foolhardy spending. In March, for example, it went to the National Science Foundation and the National Institute of Mental Health, which funded a study on the sex habits of Japanese quail.    If such awards expose the recipients to embarrassment, even ridicule, that's fine with the senator. &quot;The purpose of the award was to dramatize wasteful and extravagant spending to try to discourage it,&quot; he says. &quot;Highlighting specific, single wasteful expenditures is more effective than simply complaining in a general way about waste in government.&quot;    The wry lawmaker began the Fleece awards in 1975 by honoring the National Science Foundation, which spent $84,000 to study why people fall in love. &quot;Even if you could find out,&quot; the senator asked, &quot;would you really want to know the answer, and possibly end the mystery?&quot;    From that moment the tone was set for what has since become a minor institution in Washington: the monthly reminder, in the form of a sharp-tongued lampoon, that the Federal government is unceasing and resourceful in its efforts to get rid of other people's money on just about anything it can possibly dream up.    Over the years, almost every federal agency has gotten a Fleece. Some of the most memorable have gone to:   --The Commerce Department's Economic Development Administration, for spending $200,000 to construct an 800-foot limestone replica of the Great Wall of China in Bedford, Ind.    --The U.S. Army, for spending about $20,000 to prepare 30,000 multicolored pamphlets explaining how to play the schoolyard game called &quot;King of the Mountain.&quot;    --The Interior Department, for spending more than $140,000 on a wave-making machine in a swimming pool in Salt Lake City.    --The National Institute for Mental Health, for a study of social relationships in a Peruvian brothel.    --Three agencies, which together spent $500,000 to discover why rats, monkeys and humans clench their teeth.    --The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, for spending $102,000 to discover which makes a species of sunfish more aggressive, gin or tequila.    The award has its critics, including scientists who believe it to be fundamentally anti-intellectual. After he gave a Fleece to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration for proposing to spend more than $14 million to try to find intelligent life in outer space, a group of angry astronomers made the senator an honorary member of the Flat Earth Society.    Sen. Proxmire has not spared his own colleagues, and some of them have not been pleased. For example, after he gave his award to the Senate for proposing to buy $780,000 worth of gymnasium equipment for senators only, then-Majority Leader Howard Baker of Tennessee temporarily closed the locker room and shower facility that Sen. Proxmire used each morning after his five-mile jogs to work. The senator was sweaty but undaunted.    A call from a Proxmire staffer still makes bureaucrats quake, and the Fleece awards still get good play in newspapers across the country each month. More importantly, they have been effective; by Sen. Proxmire's count, nearly two-thirds of the 158 agencies that have gotten them to date have eliminated or cut back the programs cited.    The senator, who is retiring at the end of this year, says that if he had the resources he could find candidates to give his award weekly instead of monthly. &quot;There is a tremendous amount of back-scratching, pork-barrel activity that is wholly unjustified,&quot; he says. &quot;It's wrong, wrong, wrong.&quot;    ---   Mr. Birnbaum covers Congress and politics from The Wall Street Journal's Washington bureau. </TEXT></DOC>
