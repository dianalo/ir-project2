The so-called Uniform Defamation Act would establish anationwide system for resolving libel disputes by placing theemphasis on determining the truth or falsity of a statementrather than on awarding damages.</LP><TEXT>   Over the past five years, lawyers have made severalproposals to change libel law. But this is the first majoreffort to draft and implement uniform state libellegislation.   Media defense lawyers say that defending a libel suit isextremely expensive. And plaintiffs' lawyers complain thatthe current system doesn't adequately protect citizens fromharm to their reputations.   Under the proposed act, libel trials would be divided intotwo stages. The first would be limited solely to the questionof the truth or falsity of the disputed statements. Only inthe second stage would the question of damage awards beaddressed and the media allowed to raise constitutionaldefenses.   News organizations could limit their liability by offeringto publish a retraction and pay plaintiffs' legal fees at theend of the first stage of the trial.   Supporters of the draft say libel trials tend to placeless emphasis on truth than on issues such as whether theplaintiff is a public figure or the defendant acted withmalice.   &quot;The law is designed to provide someone a means ofreceiving vindication for reputational harm. It turns the lawon its head to in effect eliminate the question of falsity,&quot;says Randall P. Bezanson, dean of Washington and LeeUniversity School of Law and a draftsman of the bill.   But media defense lawyers have greeted the proposal withalarm. In a report prepared by members of the Libel DefenseResource Center, defense lawyers said the proposedlegislation would allow plaintiffs to circumventconstitutional privileges the media has under the FirstAmendment and a line of U.S. Supreme Court cases.   The bill rests on the assumption that &quot;what most libelplaintiffs want is a quick setting-of-the-record straight andnot damages. That has not been my experience,&quot; says LeeLevine of the Washington firm of Ross, Dixon andamp; Masback, whoworked on the report.   While no one is certain that plaintiffs would settle for aretraction and legal fees, &quot;the bill would give them theoption to stop&quot; the litigation, says John J. Walsh of the NewYork law firm of Cadwalader Wickersham andamp; Taft, who hasrepresented plaintiffs in libel suits.   The 350-member National Conference of Commissioners onUniform State Laws will discuss the bill and considerchanges. A vote is not expected before next year.   Harvey S. Perlman, dean of the University of NebraskaCollege of Law and chairman of the drafting committee, sayshe expects to hear &quot;whether we're marching along the rightpath or if it's so offensive we should change directions orgive up.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
