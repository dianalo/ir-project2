Chang Se-dong, who was director of the Agency for NationalSecurity Planning, was charged after two days of questioning.   His arrest capped months of a government investigation intoalleged corruption and abuse of power under Chun's seven-yearauthoritarian rule, which ended in February.   Chang, 53, is the highest-ranking Chun official to be arrested.   A legislator from the governing Democratic Justice Party and twopeople who were Cabinet ministers under Chun were arrested oncorruption charges early this month.   Last year, about a dozen members of Chun's family, including twobrothers, were convicted or charged with taking bribes andembezzling millions of dollars.   Chang, a former army general, was one of the most powerful men inthe nation under Chun. He played a major role in enforcing Chun'stough rule and suppressing opposition.   Prosecutors said Chang denied wrongdong, insisting that he justfollowed presidential orders. Chang was head of Chun's presidentialsecurity before serving as intelligence chief from 1985 to 1987.   Prosecutor-General Kim Gi-chun indicated Chang's arrest marked anend to the investigation.   ``In the probe, we did our best. There were no preset limitationsto our investigation. All people found involved were sent toprison,'' he told reporters.   The charges against Chang are vague and relatively mild. Theyinclude illegal construction of a guest house, which critics say wasto be used as Chun's office-mansion after retirement, and illegaluse of government office space.   South Korean press reports said prosecutors had difficultyfinding hard evidence to use against Chang.   The inquiry into Chun's government has dominated South Koreanpolitics for months, with opposition groups demanding the arrest ofChang and several other former top Chun aides on human rights abuses.   The opposition contends President Roh Tae-woo's government is notmaking sufficient efforts to prosecute former Chun aides. Roh, aformer general and once a close ally of Chun, is closely identifiedwith the ex-president in the eyes of many South Koreans.   Chun took power with military backing in 1980. Roh wonpresidential elections in December 1987 and took office in February.   In November, Chun apologized to the nation for abuses under hisrule and went into rural exile at a remote east coast Buddhistmonastery.</TEXT></DOC>
