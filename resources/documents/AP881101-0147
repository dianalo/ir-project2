Administrator Lee M. Thomas signed the protocol to the existingtreaty on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution in Sofia, Bulgaria,according to an agency announcement.   The United States earlier declined to sign a similar protocoldealing with sulfur dioxide, requiring a 30 percent reduction inemissions, on the ground that U.S. sulfur dioxide emissions had beenreduced substantially under the 1970 Clean Air Act.   Such a requirement would have been unfair, when similarpercentage reductions by European countries would be made fromalmost uncontrolled sources, the United States argued.   During negotiations on the nitrogen oxides agreement, the UnitedStates sought a 20 percent credit for reductions already made thatother countries had not yet undertaken.   As a compromise, the agreement requires participating nations tolimit emissions in the 1990s, but permits each to choose as itsceiling the emission level of any year through 1987.   In addition, the annual average from 1987 through 1996 may notexceed the average for 1987.   EPA's latest estimate is that U.S. motor vehicles, power plantsand industrial boilers produced 21.3 million tons of nitrogen oxidesin 1986. The peak year, which presumably the United States could useas its base year when the freeze takes effect, was 1978, when EPAestimates emissions at 22.4 million tons.   Forty-four percent comes from motor vehicles and othertransportation sources, and just under half from industrial andpower-plant boilers.   Nitrogen oxides are produced by all combustion, particularly athigh temperatures. Though new cars today emit only a quarter of whatcars without pollution controls emitted in the 1960s, travel hasincreased so much that emissions have declined only slightly fromthe peak and EPA expects the total to turn up again about 1995,reaching 22 million tons in the year 2000.   Participating nations are obliged to ``apply best availabletechnologies that are economically feasible'' and to controlexisting sources ``taking into account such factors as plant age andrate of utilization and the need to avoid undue operationaldisruption.''   The United States already has done that and thus ``no additionalregulatory actions are required,'' EPA said.   Major U.S. industries did not oppose U.S. adherence to theagreement after EPA pointed out its judgment that no new regulationswould be needed.   Nitrogen oxides in high concentrations can damage the lungs. Oneof these compounds provides the visible brown component of urbansmog.   Transported long distances when emitted high in the air, as froma tall smokestack, nitrogen oxides become nitric acid and falls inacid rain.   Nitrogen oxides are essential in producing the chemical reactionsthat make ozone, the major component of smog, and recent researchhas shown that even tiny amounts in forests may prompt the formationof ozone from hydrocarbons emitted by the trees themselves.   In fighting urban smog, EPA has chosen to stress reductions inhydrocarbons from fuels and solvents rather than nitrogen oxidereductions. In certain circumstances, reductions in nitrogen oxidescan increase ozone in the city before ozone concentrations startgoing down.</TEXT></DOC>
