Yet the U.S. still isrunning a persistent trade deficit of about $100 billionannually. In fact, the latest trade statistics, for October,showed a worrying 25% deterioration in the trade account, toa monthly deficit of $11.6 billion from $9.3 billion inSeptember.   This defies conventional economic wisdom. A plungingdollar should at least begin to correct the trade imbalance.What's wrong?</LP><TEXT>   Oil and autos. Period.   Excepting those, the trade imbalance has disappeared,thanks in part to the depreciating dollar.   But there are limits to depreciation. It can do nothing tocounter the economic effects of Saddam Hussein's Aug. 2invasion of Kuwait, which pushed up oil prices sharply tomore than $30 a barrel during the fall. Even now, oil ishovering around $26 a barrel, up from $18 a barrel early thisyear. Because of higher oil prices, the nation's oil deficitrose to $6.4 billion in October from $5.5 billion inSeptember.                                                                                                          A resolution of the Gulf conflict should lead to a largedrop in oil prices, probably to as low as $20 a barrel, saysJames Fralick, an economist at Morgan Stanley andamp; Co. in NewYork. That, in turn, would knock as much as $85 billion offthe trade deficit, he estimates. &quot;The run up in oil priceshas camouflaged most of the improvement that has gone on inthe trade account,&quot; he says.   The trade role of oil imports is massive. They represented53% of the overall deficit of $85.9 billion in the first 10months of 1990.   Massive as well is the trade role of automobiles, whichare also the largest consumers of oil. In the same 10 months,the deficit in cars and automotive products -- the othermajor component of the trade deficit -- was about $42.2billion.   Looking ahead, if deficits in oil and cars plus auto partsare taken out, the trade account is projected to reach asurplus of about $20 billion in 1991. That's a $60 billionimprovement from a deficit of about $40 billion for thenon-oil, non-auto trade account in 1987.   There are further benefits still to filter through frompast depreciation of the dollar.   &quot;Over the coming months, there should be some moreimprovement in the trade account,&quot; says John Williamson ofthe Institute of International Economics, a think tank here.He and his colleagues have stopped advocating dollardepreciation. In his organization, at least, &quot;I don't thinkthere's anybody now who thinks it should go down further,&quot; hesays.   In fact, there may be risks to promoting furtherdepreciation. &quot;The potential costs of further depreciation --such as inflation, a loss of confidence in U.S. financialassets and other distortions -- far outweigh any theoreticalbenefits,&quot; says Lawrence Kudlow, an economist with Bear,Stearns andamp; Co.   Depreciation also carries political costs. Some in Europe,especially in France, see it as predatory, a sign that theU.S. is subsidizing its exports and resorting to abeggar-thy-neighbor exchange-rate policy. This view has madeit harder for the U.S. to get its trading partners to droptheir own protectionist habits.   Further depreciation also won't solve the nation's basiceconomic problems. The U.S. still hasn't achieved theproductivity gains, the cutbacks in consumption and theincreases in savings that it needs for a competitive economyover the long haul.   &quot;The U.S. has to correct its overconsumption,underinvestment, undersavings mentality,&quot; says Rimmer deVries, a managing director of Morgan Guaranty Trust Co. &quot;U.S.policy makers,&quot; he adds, &quot;could do more to encourage privatesavings and stimulate equity and plant-and-equipmentinvestment, rather than real estate investment.&quot;   Further depreciation also is no substitute for an energypolicy that emphasizes less importing of oil, for even if oilprices should fall the U.S. would still face a significantdeficit in oil trade. The U.S. could look to its supplies ofnatural gas, &quot;an abundant and environmentally clean naturalresource that is highly underutilized,&quot; says Mr. de Vries. &quot;Abreakthrough in this area would strengthen greatly the U.S.trade balance, the dollar, real incomes and net savings.&quot;                                                                                                          Finally, further depreciation wouldn't address thenecessity of getting a new, strong accord under the GeneralAgreement on Tariffs and Trade. Only such an agreement willgive the U.S. the kind of access it needs to internationalmarkets to allow its competitive companies to export freely.                                                                                                          A lawless trading system wouldn't be a pretty sight. Inrecent weeks, for example, Japanese securities firmsreportedly have been doing their best to block some firmsthere from using the services of Salomon Brothers Inc. forsecurities transactions. And South Korea has recently shownan increasing willingness to pursue protectionism againstU.S. and other foreign companies.   All the dollar depreciation in the world wouldn't begin tohelp stop such activities.</TEXT></DOC>
