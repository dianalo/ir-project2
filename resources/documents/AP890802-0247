MCI said Tuesday it was lowering its interstate long-distancerates by an average of 1.5 percent, effective immediately.   The Federal Communications Commission in April imposed a new``price cap'' regulatory scheme on ATandamp;T that put limits on whatATandamp;T can charge for its long-distance services instead of limitinghow much it can earn above its costs.   The plan went into effect July 1, and ATandamp;T said its customerswould save $140 million immediately.   MCI, the nation's No. 2 long-distance provider behind ATandamp;T, saidits own rate reductions ``will ensure that MCI remains competitivein the wake of the newly implemented price cap regulations.''   MCI's residential rates will go down by an average of 1.9percent, business-commercial rates by an average of 0.4 percent andMCI card usage fees by 1 percent, the company said.   The No. 3 long-distance company, US Sprint, cut its eveninglong-distance rates 25.6 percent effective Tuesday for its newSprint Plus calling plan.</TEXT></DOC>
