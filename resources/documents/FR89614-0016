This rule was effective for 90 days, from March 15, 1989 untilJune 13, 1989. The Secretary finds that conditions justifying the emergencyaction remain unchanged. At its meeting of April 12-14, 1989, the NorthPacific Fishery Management Council (Council) reviewed the conditions warranting,and the effect of, the emergency interim rule and recommended that it shouldbe extended for an additional period of time. Therefore, the Secretaryis extending the effectiveness of the emergency interim rule by this repromulgationfor an additional 90 days under section 305(e)(3)(B) of the Magnuson Act.Further background and descriptive information is contained in the preambleof the original promulgation of this emergency interim rule. <ITAG tagnum="84">Comments Received </ITAG>Comments on the EA supporting the original promulgation of the emergencyinterim rule were invited until April 14, 1989. One letter of comment wasreceived during the comment period. It is summarized and responded to below.Numerous other letters were received before and after the comment periodconcerning bycatch management in the Bering Sea subarea. Letters in oppositionto such management by the emergency interim rule focused on the issuesraised in the comment summarized below. Other letters favored emergencyaction but requested implementation of the Council's specified bycatchlimits. The Secretary decided against such action as it would imply approvalof the recommended limits in Amendment 12a to the Fishery Management Planfor the Groundfish Fishery of the Bering Sea/Aleutian Islands (Amendment12a) prior to the statutory review period. Instead, the Secretary tookthe recommended limits under advisement and protected the area most criticalto crab and halibut with a prohibition on trawling. For interim managementpurposes, this approach balances prevention of excessive bycatch of craband halibut with the domestic harvest of allowable amounts of groundfish.<T3>Comment: </T3>There is no bycatch-related emergency. There is no indicationthat current levels of crab or halibut bycatch in the groundfish fisherythreaten biological harm to those resources or economic harm to commercialcrab and halibut fisheries. The commercial king crab fishery actually hasa high bycatch rate of immature males and females that must be discarded,and the Tanner crab fishery also may have a red king crab bycatch of millionsof animals. The need for the trawl fishery closure between 160anddegrees; and 162anddegrees;W. longitude south of 58anddegrees; N. latitude should be re-examined inlight of the shift of the red king crab population to the west. There isno justification for closing the entire area between 162anddegrees; and 163anddegrees;W. longitude south of 58anddegrees; N. latitude, since the northern halfof this corridor has few female red king crabs. There is no justificationfor closing any part of the 162anddegrees;-163anddegrees; W. longitude corridorto midwater trawling since those operations have insignificant rates ofcrab bycatch, and such closures force midwater trawl operations into otherareas such as the Gulf of Alaska. The period of any closure of the 162anddegrees;-163anddegrees;W. longitude corridor should be limited to the ``soft shell'' period forred king crab. The imposition of bycatch limits only on the trawl fishery is unfair anddiscriminatory. A reasonable bycatch control regime must take into accountthe contribution of every fishery to the bycatch ``problem.'' The crabbycatch limits are clearly inadequate and unfair to trawlers. Impositionof these limits would violate several national standards against whichall Magnuson Act measures must be judged.For the above reasons, the emergency interim rule should be modified to:(a) Allow midwater trawling throughout the 162anddegrees;-163anddegrees; W.longitude corridor, (b) allow bottom trawling in the northern half of the162anddegrees;-163anddegrees; W. longitude corridor, and (c) allow trawlerswith scientific observers on board to fish in the area between 160anddegrees;and 162anddegrees; W. longitude to collect data and evaluate the necessityof maintaining this as a closed area. No area closures or gear restrictionsshould be made in addition to those already imposed and any effort to protectcrab stocks from trawl bycatch should evaluate the groundfish catches thatare foregone by such action. <T3>Response:</T3> No modification to the original promulgation of theemergency interim rule was made for the following reasons. An emergencydid exist in the first quarter of 1989 and continues to exist. The purposeof this emergency interim rule is to prevent excessive bycatches of prohibitedspecies while allowing the groundfish fisheries adequate opportunity toharvest the total allowable catch. The Secretary has determined that excessivebycatches of prohibited species would occur unless the emergency interimrule is in effect. NOAA is aware of the bycatch of immature male and femalered king crabs in the commercial fishery for red king crabs and the bycatchof red king crabs in the Tanner crab fishery. These crab fisheries aremanaged by the State of Alaska Department of Fish and Game (ADFandamp;G),which closed the Tanner crab fishery in the Bering Sea on May 7, 1989,partly because of excessive red king crab bycatches (ADFandamp;G emergencyorder No. 4-S-09-89). Other reasons included the imminent molting period,during which time bycatch mortality increases, and a lower than expectedcatch per unit effort. Further, a complete closure of the red king crabfishery is possible due to the current severe low abundance of this species,although this decision will not be made by the ADFandamp;G until after the1989 crab survey is complete. Hence, NOAA does not perceive an unfair bycatchregulatory burden being imposed on trawlers. NOAA agrees that recent data on the distribution of red king crabs indicatea shift to the west. This is the principal reason why the Secretary closedthe area between 162anddegrees; and 163anddegrees; W. longitude south of 58anddegrees;N. latitude, in addition to the ``traditional'' closed area between 160anddegrees;and 162anddegrees; W. longitude south of 58anddegrees; N. latitude. Currently,NOAA is re-examining the efficacy of redrawing the closed area boundaries.Based on the most recent crab survey data (distribution and abundance datacollected during June and July 1988), about 26.5 percent of the total redking crab population in the eastern Bering Sea occurred between 160anddegrees;and 162anddegrees; W. longitude south of 58anddegrees; N. latitude and northof the Alaska Peninsula. Although this proportion of the population isless than it has been in recent years, it is nevertheless significant.Based on the same data, the adjacent area, between 162anddegrees;-163anddegrees;W. longitude, contains about 48.4 percent of the total red king crab populationin the eastern Bering Sea. Together, these two areas, which are closed(with certain exceptions) to trawling under the emergency interim rule,contain about 75 percent of the red king crab population.NOAA agrees also that there are relatively few mature female red king crabsin the northern half (between 56anddegrees;30andmin16; and 58anddegrees; N. latitude)of the 162anddegrees;-163anddegrees; W. longitude corridor. Crab survey dataindicate that within this corridor, the red king crab population seemsmost abundant between 55anddegrees;30andmin16; and 56anddegrees;30andmin16; N.latitude which contains about 41.2 percent of the total population in theeastern Bering Sea. However, a significant proportion of the mature malecrabs, about 15.4 percent of the total mature male red king crab population,occurs in the northern half of the 162anddegrees;-163anddegrees; W. longitudecorridor. The entire corridor contains about 27 percent of the mature malepopulation which is comparable to the 31 percent contained in the 160anddegrees;-162anddegrees;W. longitude area that is nearly twice the size of the corridor area. Thesemature male animals are the most valuable to the commercial red king crabfishery and would most immediately impact that fishery if the mature maleswere unprotected from interaction with trawl gear. For this reason, theSecretary is continuing the closure of the 162anddegrees;-163anddegrees; corridorand not limiting it to the mating and molting (``soft shell'') period asrecommended by the Council. As its name implies, midwater or off-bottom trawl gear usually does notoperate in contact with the sea bottom where crabs live. Therefore, suchtrawl gear often has substantially lower bycatch rates than bottom trawlgear. This appears especially true when midwater gear is used during thefirst 4 months of the year to harvest pollock in spawning aggregations.However, midwater trawl gear can be rigged at other times to catch fishvery close to the sea bottom, for example, pollock in more dispersed feedingschools during the summer. The bycatch rates of midwater gear operatedclose to the bottom may be significantly greater than when the gear isoperated higher in the water column. As such, there is no way for NOAAto verify whether any particular midwater trawl is being operated at adepth that will minimize its bycatch. Bycatch data from an on-board observercould indicate that at certain times a midwater trawl probably was fishingvery close to the bottom relative to other times, but this would involve``after-the-fact'' reconstruction of fishing behavior. Hence, regardlessof the presence of observers, NOAA has no way of being certain that midwatertrawl gear will not also catch crabs and halibut. Therefore, the Secretaryis not modifying the constraint on using midwater trawl gear in the closedarea. Although closed areas force fishing activities to relocate to otherareas, NOAA is convinced that closure of the area will not prevent or significantlyimpede attainment of the allowable harvest of groundfish. The emergency interim rule does not impose the Council's recommended overallbycatch limits on the trawl fishing industry. The preamble to the originalpromulgation of the emergency interim rule states (at 54 FR 11379) onlythat the bycatch limits recommended by the Council at its January 1989meeting would guide the Secretary in deciding whether additional regulatorycontrols on bycatch are warranted. This does not necessarily imply automaticclosure of other areas when the recommended bycatch limits are attained.A final decision by the Secretary on whether to approve and implement theCouncil's recommended bycatch limits in Amendment 12a must be made by July7, 1989. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects </ITAG>50 CFR Part 611 Fisheries, Foreign fishing. 50 CFR Part 675 Fisheries, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: June 9, 1989.     </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">James E.
