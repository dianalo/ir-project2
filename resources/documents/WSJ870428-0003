President Jaime Lusinchi worked with advisers yesterday on the &quot;final details&quot; of the plan, &quot;designed to compensate workers with a strategy against indiscriminate price hikes and speculation,&quot; an official statement said.    The plan is expected to include government subsidies for basic products, more public jobs and price controls, the statement said. The nation's major labor organization, the Venezuelan Workers Confederation, has been pressuring the government for a general wage and salary increase ranging from 10% to 30%. According to the central bank, inflation in the first quarter reached 6%. On an annual basis, that is more than last year's inflation rate and represents the highest rate in decades.    President Lusinchi is expected to announce the compensation plan in his traditional May Day speech on Friday.    Separately, Venezuela's finance minister, Manuel Azpurua Arreaza, said he will go to Japan next month to obtain loans for public-sector investments, according to local newspapers. Mr. Azpurua wasn't quoted as saying how much money Venezuela would request. </TEXT></DOC>
