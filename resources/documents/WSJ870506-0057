The tribunal's order had been delayed for several months, partly because the U.S. has insisted that Iran state in writing that settling the claims isn't linked to U.S. efforts to free seven Americans hostages held in Lebanon. Iranian officials, in public statements as recent as April, have suggested such a connection.    But the tribunal's order specifically says &quot;that there is no room for any doubt&quot; that concluding the case isn't linked either to the hostages or other political issues involving the two countries.    Officials said the U.S. will abide by the tribunal's decision even if Iranian officials continue to make public statements that returning the money is connected to Iranian help in gaining the hostages' release. Iran could otherwise turn to U.S. courts, which can enforce findings of the tribunal.    The funds are the remainder of a deposit Iran made in an account at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. The money was part of a settlement of claims that arose in 1979 after American hostages were seized at the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and the U.S., in response, froze Iranian assets.    Under the agreement that led to the release of U.S. Embassy hostages in Tehran in January 1981, Iran deposited $3.76 billion with the Federal Reserve Bank to pay U.S. members of international bank syndicates that had lent money to Iran during the late Shah's rule.    Iran, in an apparent effort to keep a good credit rating, subsequently paid off some loans to non-U.S. members of banking syndicates. And the foreign banks passed a share of the money to their U.S. banking partners. As a result, there was more money in the Fed account than was needed to pay U.S. banks. Including interest, the surplus totaled $451 million.    Iran has appealed for the return of the surplus money since 1982, and the tribunal ruled that Washington should release the money in August. The Iran-Contra scandal, however, made Washington particularly anxious for a statement from Tehran that the White House wasn't making arrangements again with the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini to get help in releasing U.S. hostages.    The tribunal's finding quoted two statements by Iranian officials provided by Tehran, including one by Speaker of the Parliament Hashemi Rafsanjani at a Jan. 28 news conference. &quot;The issue of hostages has no relation with the debt due to us from the United States and the assets which must be returned to us,&quot; the statement said.    The $451 million claim is only the tip of the iceberg of matters still being considered by the tribunal, which is made up of Iranian, U.S. and neutral judges. Some $10 billion to $12 billion in other claims is also being considered, an administration official said. These range from U.S. oil companies' claims against the Iranian government to Iranian claims concerning undelivered military equipment.    The tribunal's decisions have resulted in $858 million in American private claims being paid by Iran and $64 million in Iranian claims paid by Washington, an administration official said. </TEXT></DOC>
