For Asian and some European markets, it was the first chance to react to Friday's report of a narrower U.S. trade deficit.    Tokyo share prices closed mostly higher at the end of the afternoon session, but off their best levels, as buying interest subsided after a sharp rally in the opening hour of the morning session.    The Nikkei index of 225 selected issues, which gained 278.66 points last Thursday, added 306.55 points to close at 22910.20. The Tokyo Stock Exchange's first section index rose 27.73 points to 1828.09. First section volume was estimated at 600 million shares, up from 480 million shares Thursday. Tokyo markets were closed Friday.    In early trading in Tokyo Tuesday, share prices held steady. The Nikkei index declined 0.76 point to 22909.44 at the end of the morning session.    The morning session Monday opened with a wave of buying across the board prompted by Friday's surprisingly good U.S. trade figures, pushing the index to 23077.86 within the first half-hour of trading.    Investors appeared to grow cautious, however, after the Nikkei index reached the 23000-level, traders said, and some selling emerged by investors covering themselves against a potential sell-off.    &quot;Many people seemed to say, when the index hit 23000, that even though the U.S. trade figures were very good, that isn't enough by itself to keep share prices at this level,&quot; said one trader.    One of Monday's most actively traded shares, Sumitomo Chemical, closed up 32 yen at 1,010 ($7.70) on volume of more than 75 million shares, as two-week-old news of a breakthrough in superconductor research continued to fuel speculative buying.    Blue-chip electrical issues such as NEC, TDK, Toshiba and Fujitsu ended higher. Toshiba closed up 33, or 5%, at 679.    Among financial shares, brokerages and banks both posted gains. Nikko Securities gained 100 points to 1530, while Yamaichi Securities rose 90 points to 1550.    In London, share prices ended slightly higher but well below their best levels as trading activity slackened in the afternoon.    The Financial Times 30-share index was up 3.4 points at 1440.1. Volume was a modest 417.7 million shares, down from 528.6 million shares Friday. The 100-share index was up 3.3 points at 1790.0.    Dealers reported modest two-way institutional business early in the day in a continuation of Friday's strong activity that followed the release of the U.S. trade data. But business tapered off in the afternoon on a lack of fresh market-affecting news and little inspiration from Wall Street, where trading was slow because of Martin Luther King Day.    BTR rose 10 pence to 277 ($5), boosted by various rumors and by perceptions the shares were undervalued. The shares have been trailing the overall market in recent weeks on concern the company might launch a new takeover bid for Pilkington following its failed attempt last year to take over the British glass maker. A yearlong waiting period before such a new bid could be launched expires Wednesday.    But dealers and analysts say they doubt BTR will make another attempt to acquire Pilkington after the embarrassment suffered in last year's failed bid. They said BTR shares recovered from their recent poor performance, helped in part by rumors, including that the company sold its 3.8% stake in Pilkington to a Japanese investment house. BTR wouldn't comment on the rumors.    Meanwhile, Pilkington shares ended up 1 at 248.    In major corporate news, ASDA-MFI Group reported pretax profit rose 10.1% in the 28 weeks ended Nov. 14 from the year-earlier period. The shares were down 2 at 175.    Share prices on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange rallied in active trading on the dollar's surge, but ended below their earlier highs.    News that the U.S. trade deficit narrowed had already pushed equities sharply higher in after-hours trading Friday, brokers said.    Most blue-chip stocks held these levels at the opening, but profit-taking set in around midday and trimmed some of the market's gains.    Brokers traced the late sell-off to the willingness of institutional investors to cash in on their profits quickly, and to the dollar's retreat to a level around 1.6850 marks from its earlier peak near 1.70 marks.    Most market participants are still hesitant to build up longer-term holdings in West German stocks, one Frankfurt broker said. &quot;People have been burned by the dollar too many times; they don't trust its strength yet,&quot; he said.    Chemical and automobile shares, which are seen to benefit most directly from the stronger dollar, paced the market, while retailing issues declined. Bayerische Motoren Werke soared 37 marks, or 8%, to 502 ($298), lifted by a positive report for 1987 and an 11% increase in group sales. Daimler-Benz firmed 19 to 573, and Volkswagen gained 9.8 to 214.8. Schering posted the largest gain in the chemical sector, surging 29.8 to 385.    Other European exchanges were mostly higher. Stocks closed up in Zurich, Brussels, Stockholm and Milan. But prices were mixed in Amsterdam and lower in Paris, where investors decided that Friday's runup on the trade news was a good opportunity to take profits.    In Asian markets, prices jumped in Sydney, Hong Kong, Singapore, Taipei and Wellington. The Manila market was closed for local elections.
