Schlesinger and Melinda Grenier GuilesStaff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 04/17/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> GM LABORAUTOS, AUTO PARTS (AUT) </IN><DATELINE> DETROIT  </DATELINE><TEXT>   General Motors Corp. plans to eliminate its 69-year-old cash and stock bonus plan for executives and replace it with a stock incentive program that links compensation more directly to &quot;the enhancement of stockholder value,&quot; according to Roger B. Smith, chairman.    Traditionally, GM executives' bonuses constitute a major portion of their compensation. For 1986, GM awarded bonuses totaling about $169 million in cash and stock to its top 5,460 salaried employees. The size of that payment was determined by a formula pegged to the company's profits. Under the new plan, management would receive stock options and restricted stock grants, but no cash. A GM spokesman said he didn't know how total payments would be affected, or the criteria under which the payments would be awarded.    The move comes at a time when GM faces cost pressures and has been paring expenses in a wide variety of areas. The shift also follows a series of shocks for GM's white-collar employees. The company is currently slashing its salaried work force by 25%, and it eliminated base-pay raises over the past year for 110,000 U.S. and Canadian salaried workers who are ineligible for bonuses.    Although many U.S. companies have shifted executive compensation more toward stock performance in recent years, management consultants said they believe GM would be the first corporation to eliminate its cash bonus plan. Roughly 90% of all major U.S. corporations have cash bonus plans, and GM's was one of the first.    Changing the bonus plan &quot;does pose a risk&quot; to employee morale, acknowledged Robert Stempel, a GM executive vice president. &quot;The plan is virtually 70 years old and has served us very, very well. But when it all settles down, people will realize that we are focusing on the long term and emphasizing the long-term value of the stock.&quot;    GM's proposed executive compensation plan will take effect June 1 if it is approved at the company's annual meeting next month. The plan was disclosed in GM's proxy statement, which it issued yesterday. In addition to proposing the new incentive plan, GM said in the proxy it will ask holders to approve a plan limiting director liabilities.    In the proxy, GM also stated that Mr. Smith's total cash compensation for 1986 dropped 8.5% to $1,088,000 from $1,190,000 for 1985. While his salary increased slightly, Mr. Smith's bonus dropped sharply because the company's earnings declined 26%.    The No. 1 auto maker's executive bonuses came under harsh criticism earlier this year, particularly from the United Auto Workers union, when hourly workers were told earnings were insufficient for them to receive profit-sharing payments. GM faces national contract talks with the union later this year.    The UAW, in a prepared statement, said it hadn't had time to study the new executive plan, but added that the new policy &quot;still falls far short of union expectations for a more responsible policy, even though it appears to be a partial step in the direction of focusing on more long-term performance.&quot;    GM's bylaws require shareholder approval of the executive incentive program every five years. In December 1985, the board appointed a committee of outside directors to review the current system for the 1987 annual meeting. That study recommended the drastic overhaul.    The new plan &quot;will aid in shifting the strategic orientation of GM's senior management to a more long-term business view, which is more closely aligned with the interests of stockholders,&quot; the company said in a statement. Analysts pointed out another advantage: the new plan helps reduce GM's cash outlays at a time when it is trying to cut costs.    Management consultants generally praised the shift, arguing that traditional bonus plans pegged to profit can distort executive behavior. If executives pushed for short-term profit at the expense of the underlying strength of the company, they could boost their bonuses at a time when &quot;shareholders aren't likely to see the value of their investment increase,&quot; said Jude T. Rich, president of Sibson andamp; Co., a compensation consultant.    But if the new plan weighs more heavily toward stock gifts than stock options, the incentive to enhance shareholder value may be blunted, said one management consultant. &quot;The stock doesn't have to go up for them to make money; they just have to hang around,&quot; he said.    Currently, GM has three executive incentive plans. One provides a bonus in the form of cash and stock. A second provides stock options, and the third gives cash and/or stock for meeting long-term performance goals. The cash-and-stock bonus plan, which covers about 5,000 top managers, is the largest. About 800 executives received stock options in 1986, and 600 qualified for the performance achievement cash award. Under the proposed plan, the bonus and stock option plans would be scrapped, but the performance rewards for the top executives will continue.    In addition to Mr. Smith, other top GM officials also received less in cash compensation for 1986, according to the proxy. President F. James McDonald's cash compensation dropped to $944,000 from $1,025,000 for 1985. Former Vice Chairman Howard Kehrl received $813,000, compared with $920,000. F. Alan Smith, GM's executive vice president, finance, received $677,000, compared with $755,000.    In addition to changes in executive compensation, GM is asking shareholders at its May 22 annual meeting to approve a new provision in GM's certificate of incorporation that would limit or eliminate &quot;the potential monetary liability of directors . . . by reason of their conduct as directors,&quot; the proxy said. &quot;Such conduct could include grossly negligent decisions in relation to any business matter including mergers and other reorganizations, acquisitions and dispositions of property, takeover proposals and product development programs,&quot; according to the proxy.    Delaware, the state in which GM is incorporated, amended its laws last year allowing such a change in a company's certificate of incorporation, and many corporations have already taken such action. The proxy noted the increasing unwillingness of directors to serve on boards without greater protection, and said the premiums for GM's director insurance have &quot;increased substantially.&quot;    The proxy said such a change wouldn't affect outstanding litigation, specifically lawsuits filed last year in connection with the company's $750 million buyout of director H. Ross Perot and his associates. </TEXT></DOC>
