Confidence in the Federal Reserve Board's ``soft-landing''policy of controlled expansion to limit inflation and unemploymentwas a primary reason for the largely favorable report issued by theNational Association of Business Economists.   ``The Fed is trying to prevent growth from going too fast or tooslow. It seems to be working, and the vast majority of this grouplikes this very much,'' said James F. Smith, vice president of theorganization, which is holding its annual meeting here.   A majority of NABE forecasting experts, 52 percent, expected thecurrent record peacetime expansion to continue until late 1991 orbeyond. That would surpass the 106-month record set during a periodin the 1960s that included the war in Vietnam.   Only 9.9 percent expected a recession this year, and only 21percent predicted an economic slowdown in 1990.   Association experts also forecast that the growth in the grossnational product, adjusted for inflation, would continue at thecurrent 2.1 percent annual rate through 1990, then rise to anaverage 2.7 a year for the 1989-93 five-year period.   ``No boom, no bust, more good news than bad,'' was how Smithcharacterized the report, which also predicted continued low levelsof inflation and unemployment.   The NABE's predictions were echoed by Michael Boskin, chairmanof the president's Council of Economic Advisers, who spoke to 400of the association's members Monday.   ``We anticipate continued growth for the economy albeit at aslower rate,'' said Boskin, who predicted a 2.5 percent growth ratein 1989 that would pick up somewhat in mid-1990.   ``Our best guess ... is for sustained moderate growth, gradualreductions in inflation and continued low employment,'' he said.   The NABE economists predicted 5 percent annual inflation forthis year's October through December quarter and 4.3 percent forall of 1993. Unemployment, the lowest in 15 years, should average5.3 percent this year and rise only to 5.7 percent in 1990, thepanel said.   While economists welcomed slower growth as a way of curbinginflation, they acknowledged it would be so sluggish for the nexttwo years that it would feel like a downturn for many industries.   ``Some parts of the country and some industries ... are going tofeel they're in a recession,'' Smith said.   Businesses most affected would be producers of consumer goodsbecause consumers are holding onto their wallets, the NABE said.Consumer spending, which grew 3.4 percent last year, will grow 2.2percent this year and 1.9 percent in 1990, economists said.   ``For a country in which `shop 'til you drop' is almost thenational battle cry, this could easily be viewed as the mostun-American forecast ever issued by the NABE forecast panel,'' theassociation report said.   Meanwhile, consumers are saving more, said the panel, whichexpects the savings rate to soar because of continued lowunemployment.   The NABE also expected the nation's twin trade and budgetdeficit to continue their slow decline.   The economists' median forecast for the trade deficit was $110billion this year and $100 billion in 1990, compared with $122.8billion in 1988.   The survey panel expects a $150 billion budget deficit this yearand $135 billion in 1990, compared with $155.1 billion last year.The forecast is far from the $100 billion deficit reduction ceilingmandated for fiscal 1990 by the Gramm-Rudman law.   Other forecasts in the survey included:   _Industrial production should grow 3.1 percent this year,slowing to 1.7 percent in 1990.   _Construction of new homes and apartments is forecast to average1.42 million units this year and 1.45 million units in 1990.   _Car and truck sales are expected to total 15 million this yearbefore falling to 14.7 million in 1990.</TEXT></DOC>
