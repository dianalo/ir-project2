If under generaltort principles . . . the employer fully informs the woman ofthe risk, and the employer has not acted negligently, thebasis for holding an employer liable seems remote at best.&quot;   THE SUPREME COURT                                                                                                       </LP><TEXT>   Next time a foreigner asks how the U.S. legal system gotso muddled and expensive, cite this week's Johnson Controlsdecision by the Supreme Court. One part politically correctrhetoric about equal rights for women, one part whistlingpast the grave of the liability explosion, the Justices inAutomobile Workers v. Johnson Controls pronounced thatAmericans must from now on walk north and south at the sametime.   Specifically: (1) Businesses may not prohibit women fromjobs that will result in birth defects, and (2) women andchildren born deformed can then sue the employer. ThisCatch-$22 million in punitive damages is a fine example ofhow American law now creates disorder.   Without specifically envisioning the dangers of poisons tofetuses, Congress in the Pregnancy Discrimination Actprohibited employment exceptions for women. The Justices saidthey were bound to enforce this law. The problem is that theJustices did not then take the logical next step. This is thefundamental judicial duty of ensuring some level of dueprocess by making sure that no one, even companies, will facelawsuits for complying with the law. Instead, all nineJustices ducked this issue.   The claim in the majority opinion that only businessesthat are negligent will lose tort cases is, at the veryleast, quaint. The Supreme Court may not have noticed but forthe past 30 years the great project of contingency-feelawyers and liberal judges has been to expand strictliability to cover deep-pocket defendants in nearly allcircumstances. Is there a jury in the land that would tell aninjured child who sues a corporation that, sorry, your motherdecided to risk it and you must pay the price?   The majority opinion claims that federalanti-discrimination laws and the existence of OccupationalSafety and Health Administration standards would pre-emptlawsuits in state courts. But there is no assurance thatcompliance with civil-rights laws or OSHA standards is anydefense; a separate opinion by Justice Byron White says themajority opinion &quot;offers no support&quot; for this assurance.   A full understanding of this case requires not legal butpolitical analysis. The interest groups that brought andsupported the lawsuit -- unions, the ACLU, women's groups --would be the first to call for the financial pillorying of aHooker Chemical for its involvement with a Love Canal. Yetsimultaneously it is a moral offense for employers to try toprevent injuries to workers by dangerous substances.Plaintiff lawyers will have a field day, especially becausethe net result will indeed be more workplace injuries.Shareholders beware.   Many industrial processes involve the use of potentiallydangerous substances that can't be eliminated. To avoidliability, some firms will likely send such jobs out of theU.S. But next time Congress debates &quot;competitiveness,&quot; no onewill propose changing the law to let firms protect jobs,protect fetuses or protect themselves from litigation.   Eventually the lower courts and the Justices themselveswill have to come to terms with the self-contradicting legalrules of this case. When they do, they should ask preciselywhat the constitutional guarantee of due process means in alegal system where you're sued if you do, sued if you don't.</TEXT></DOC>
