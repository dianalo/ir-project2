An American spokesman confirmed that the carrier is considering the purchase of as many as 100 of the 186-seat aircraft. Such an order would be for as much as $4 billion, industry analysts say.    &quot;It's not a done deal yet,&quot; said the spokesman for American, a unit of AMR Corp. based in Fort Worth, Texas. But he added that there's a &quot;very good chance it will happen.&quot; A spokeswoman for Seattle-based Boeing said, &quot;Of course we're talking to them, but we cannot confirm a single word about a deal.&quot;    An order that large could help make 1988 a record year for Boeing sales. Last week, the company sold 100 aircraft and options for 20 additional aircraft, valued at about $4.6 billion, to International Lease Finance Corp., based in Beverly Hills, Calif.    In Friday's New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Boeing shares jumped $1.50 to $50.50.    Should the American sale go through, it could have even greater significance for the future of Boeing's twin-engine 757 program.    Boeing designed the plane, which entered service in 1983, to replace its rapidly aging 727 model. But airlines have been flying their 727s much longer than Boeing expected, largely because of low fuel prices that permit older aircraft to remain cost-efficient. In the 10-year period during which Boeing has been taking orders for it, air carriers have purchased only 279 of the 757 model aircraft.    Delta Airlines, which ordered 60 of the aircraft in 1980, has been the biggest customer for the model. Other purchasers have included Northwest, Eastern and British Airways.    A big 757 sale also could be an indication that airlines believe it's time to replace aging fleets of small planes with newer, larger models. The average age of U.S. jetliners has risen 21%, to 12.53 years, since 1979, leading to increasing concern about the safety of aging aircraft. American Airlines has 164 of the 727 model still in service, and its executives have talked about the need to replace the oldest of them. American's first 727 was ordered in 1961.    The newer Boeing 757 would also give American Airlines an economic edge. It has a seating capacity of 68 passengers more than American's 727s, which have been laid out to hold 118 passengers. What's more, it requires only a two-member cockpit crew, compared with the 727's three members. The 757s also would replace the older Boeing 737s that American acquired when it bought AirCal in 1986, a spokesman for American said. The spokesman declined to comment on possible financing.    As part of a rapid growth plan launched in 1983, American has increased its fleet 128 aircraft to 430 in the past two years alone. The new aircraft helped accommodate service from expanding hubs in Nashville, Tenn., Raleigh-Durham, N.C., and San Juan, Puerto Rico, as well as increased international service.    The American spokesman couldn't comment on where new 757s might be deployed. All the 737s acquired with AirCal have continued to fly West Coast routes.    American is also scheduled to take delivery of 66 new aircraft for its expanded route system this year, including 16 Boeing 767-200s, 37 MD-80s, and 13 Airbus A300-600s. By the end of 1988 -- not counting the potential new Boeing order -- 62% of American's aircraft will be in the quietest noise category, to meet increasingly stringent airport environmental regulations, Robert Crandall, chairman of AMR, said at the company's annual meeting last week.    &quot;American's fleet is now one of the youngest, quietest and most fuel-efficient in the industry,&quot; he said.    In recent years, fuel costs have been as high as 29% of American's total operating expenses -- the second largest category after labor costs. In 1987, American's fuel expenses were 14% of total costs. </TEXT></DOC>
