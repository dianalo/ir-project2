ISO 8879-1986specifies a language for describing documents to be used in office documentprocessing, interchange between authors and between authors and publishers,and publishing. The language provides a coherent and unambiguous sysntaxfor describing the elements within a document. The language includes:  a. An abstract syntax for descriptive markup of the elements within a document.  b. A reference concrete syntax which binds the abstract syntax to particulardelimite chracters and quantities.  c. Markup declarations that allow the definition of a specific vocabularyof generic identifiers and atributes for different document types.  d. Provision for arbitrary data content. This can include specialized datacontent notations that require interpretations different from general text,i.e., formulas, images, non-Latin alphabets, previously formatted textor graphic.  e. Entity references for referring to content located outside the mainstreamof the document, such as separately written chapters, photographs, etc. f. Special delimiters for processing instructions to distinguish them fromdescriptive markup. Processing instructions are systems and applicationsdependent.  <T3>Approving Authority. </T3>Secretary of Commerce.  <T3>Maintenance Agency. </T3>Department of Commerce, National Instituteof Standards and Technology (NIST) (National Computer and TelecommunicationsLaboratory.  <T3>Cross Index. </T3>International Standards Organization ISO 8879-1986,Information Processing_Text and Office Systems_Standard Generalized MarkupLanguage (SGML).  <T3>Related Documents.  </T3>a.

Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) Publication 29-2, InterpretationProcedures for Federal Information Processing Standards for Software. <T3>Objectives. </T3>The primary objectives of this standard are:  To provide a common markup language for a variety of document types anduses;  To allow the portability of unformatted textual data among different installationsand processing systems;  To promote interchange of documents between systems of different manufactures. <T3>Applicability. </T3>This standard is intended to be used for documentsthat are processed by any text processing system. It is particularly applicableto: (a) Documents that are intended for electronic printed output; (b)documents that are interchanged among systems with differing text outputdevices; and (c) documents that are processed in more than one way, evenwhen the procedures use the same text processing language.     Documents that exist solely in formatted form are not within the scopeof applicability of this standard.This standard applies to the development and acquisition of SGML systems.An SGML system includes an SGML parser, which must be able to recognizemarkup in conforming SGML documents; an entity manager, such as file systemor symbol table that can maintain and provide access to multiple entitiesor units of information; and both or either of: a. An implementation of one or more SGML applications; and/or b. Facilities for a user to implement SGML applications, with access tothe SGML parser and entity manager. If the SGML parser is a validating parser, it must find and report a reportablemarkup errort if one exists, and must recognize and report ambiguous contentmodels. An implementation of SGML involves consideration of an entire SGML system.<T3>Specifications.</T3> The ISO 8879-1986 Standard Generalized MarkupLanguage defines the scope of the specification, the field of application,the syntax and semantics of SGML constructs, and requirements for confomingSGML applications and documents. All of the specifications of ISO 8879-1986,using the core concrete syntax, apply to FIPS SGML with the exception ofthe following optional features: SHORTREF; CONCUR; DATATAG; RANK; SHORTTAG;SUBDOC; SIMPLE; IMPLICIT; and EXPLICIT. The two optional features thatare part of the FIPS SGML are OMITTAG (omitted tag minimization) and FORMAL(formal public identifiers). The core concrete syntax is a variant of thereference concrete syntax that has no short reference delimiters. <T3>Implementation.</T3> This standard is compulsory and binding. The implementationof this standard involves two areas of consideration: acquisition of SGMLsystems and interpretation of the syntax and semantics of SGML constructs.<T3>Acquisition of SGML Systems.</T3> This standard is effective March31, 1989. SGML systems developed or acquired for Federal use after thisdate should implement this standard. Conformance to this standard shouldbe considered whether SGML systems are developed internally, acquired aspart of an ADP system procurement, acquired by separate procurement, usedunder an ADP leasing arrangement, or specified for use in contracts forprogramming services. If the functionality of one or more of the optionalfeatures meets programmatic requirements, then those optional featuresmay be acquired. A transition period provides time for industry to produce SGML systemsconforming to the standard. The transition period begins on the effectivedate and continues for one year thereafter. The provisions of this publicationapply to orders placed after the effective date. <T3>Interpretation of FIPS SGML.</T3> Resolution of questions regardingthis standard will be provided by NIST. Questions concerning the contentand specifications of this FIPS PUB should be addressed to: Director, NationalComputer and Telecommunications Laboratory, Attn: SGML Interpretation,National Institute of Standards and Technology, Gaithersburg, MD 20899.<T3>Waivers.</T3> Under certain exceptional circumstances, the heads ofFederal departments and agencies may approve waivers to Federal InformationProcessing Standards (FIPS). The head of such agency may redelegate suchauthority only to a senior official designated pursuant to section 3506(b)of Title 44, United States Code. Requests for waivers shall be granted only when: a. Compliance with a standard would adversely affect the accomplishmentof the mission of an operator of a Federal computer system, or b. Cause a major adverse financial impact on the operator which is notoffset by Government-wide savings. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Agency heads may act only upon written waiver requests containingthe information detailed above. Agency heads may approve requests for waiversonly by a written decision which explains the basis upon which the agencyhead made the required finding(s). A copy of each such decision, with procurementsensitive or classified portions clearly identified, shall be sent to the:Director, National Computer and Telecommunications Laboratory, ATTN: FIPSWaiver Decisions, Technology Building, Room B-154, National Institute ofStandards and Technology, Gaithersburg, MD 20899. In addition notice ofeach waiver granted and each delegation of authority to approve waiversshall be sent promptly to the Committee on Government Operations of theHouse of Representatives and the Committee on Governmental Affairs of theSenate and shall be published promptly in the <T4>Federal Register.</T4>When the determination on a waiver request applies to the procurement ofequipment and/or services, a notice of the waiver determination must bepublished in the <T3>Commerce Business Daily </T3>as a part of the notice of solicitationfor offers of an acquisition or, if the waiver determination is made afterthat notice is published, by amendment to such notice. A copy of the waiver request, any supporting documents, the document approvingthe waiver request and any supporting and accompanying document(s), withsuch deletions as the agency is authorized and decides to make under 5U.S.C. Sec. 552(b), shall be part of the procurement documentation andretained by the agency.<T2>Special Information. </T2>Another approach, to the interchange of documents,currently under development, is the Office Document Architecture and OfficeDocument Interchange Format (ODA/ODIF), draft international standard (DIS8613). NIST is currently working on the development of this draft standardwhich, when completed, will become a Federal Information Processing Standard.<T2>Where to Obtain Copies. </T2>Copies of this publication are for saleby the National Technical Information Service, U.S. Department of Commerce,Springfield, VA 22161.
