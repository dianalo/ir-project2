The acquisition, which caps a dramatic comeback byBankAmerica, will make the bank the undisputed power in theWest. But more, it will position the bank as one of a fewpotential leaders in national branch banking, which Congressis expected to approve sometime this year.</LP><TEXT>   BankAmerica, currently the nation's second-largest bank,said it plans to acquire Security Pacific, ranked fifth, forstock valued at about $4.47 billion, based on yesterday'sshare prices. The merged bank will initially have assets of$193.6 billion, second only to Citicorp and well above theassets of the third-largest bank, the just-announced mergerof Chemical Banking and Manufacturers Hanover. In terms ofmarket capitalization, however, the new bank, which will keepthe BankAmerica name, will be the biggest in the country --more than two and one-half times larger than Citicorp. Theresulting giant will also have the most equity capital, coreearnings, domestic assets and branch networks.   BankAmerica reigned as the country's largest bank untilthe late 1970s but then stumbled so badly that it was atakeover target itself just three years ago. Now, investmentbankers expect BankAmerica to use the expanded equity baseand market capitalization to launch bank acquisitions inregions outside the West. The legislation Congress isexpected to pass would allow banks to operate interstate bankholdings as one branch network, setting the stage for a raceto establish nationwide retail operations. The newBankAmerica will face formidable competitors, including BancOne of Ohio and NationsBank, the proposed marriage of NCNBCorp. and Candamp;S/Sovran.   &quot;This clearly sets up the idea of a national franchisepotentially run out of the West, rather than the East,&quot; saysRichard Barrett, managing director in charge of financialinstitutions for Salomon Brothers. &quot;In one fell swoop, BofAhas really locked up the West.&quot;   BankAmerica's chairman, Richard Rosenberg, estimates thatthe new company will add $1 billion to annual pretax earningsover the next three years because of savings from pruningoverlapping operations. That would put the new BankAmerica'syearly core earnings before taxes and loan-loss provision atabout $4.75 billion, compared to Citicorp's 1990 coreearnings of $3.5 billion.   Mr. Rosenberg and other BankAmerica officers went to somelengths yesterday to portray the acquisition as a merger ofequals, saying for instance that the new company willmaintain two headquarters, one in Los Angeles, where SecurityPacific is based, and one in San Francisco, BankAmerica'shome. But Security Pacific managers conceded, not forattribution, that BankAmerica was calling the shots, and thatthey would bear the brunt of the cost-cutting. They estimatethat as many as 10,000 jobs, out of a combined 93,800, willbe eliminated. BankAmerica said it expects it will take arestructuring charge of $700 million, much of it forseverance.   &quot;There are a lot of panic-stricken people in this buildingright now,&quot; said one middle manager at Security Pacific'sheadquarters, where Mr. Rosenberg held a press conferencewith Robert Smith, Security Pacific's chairman. Adds anotheryoung, midlevel banker: &quot;We've begun to call it InsecurityPacific.&quot;   Mr. Rosenberg, 61, will run the new BankAmerica forseveral years as its chairman and chief executive officer,while Mr. Smith, 55, will act as president and chiefoperating officer. The management committee is composed ofsix representatives from BankAmerica and four from SecurityPacific, although the board's 30 members will be evenlydivided between the two banks. If Mr. Rosenberg is leadingthe bank, it is more likely that his heir apparent, believedto be vice chairman Lewis Coleman, will succeed him ratherthan Security Pacific's Mr. Smith.   The proposed acquisition is, in fact, something of arescue of beleaguered Security Pacific, which has beenweakened by huge losses on bad loans in the United Kingdom,Australia and Arizona, and realestate loans in California.The problems have saddled Security Pacific with too manynonperforming assets, essentially forcing it out of thenationwide banking derby. But Mr. Rosenberg said he plannedto clean up Security Pacific's books by taking a $1 billioncharge for more reserves. Both the new reserves and therestructuring charge will be offset by increasing to marketvalue Security Pacific's other assets, such as real estateholdings.   Although BankAmerica's credit officers have conducted adue-diligence investigation of Security Pacific's troubledassets, the state of the bank's portfolio remains the biggestrisk to BankAmerica in what is otherwise being hailed as acoup.   &quot;One of the negatives in the transaction is the continueddeterioration in Security Pacific's credit quality, which ishighlighted by the addition of the $1 billion reserve,&quot; saysThomas Hanley, a banking analyst for Salomon Brothers.   Nonetheless, investors applauded the deal. SecurityPacific's stock price soared $9.125 a share to close at$32.125 in trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Meanwhile,BankAmerica's stock jumped to $40 a share, up $2.625.   Since Mr. Rosenberg succeeded A.W. (Tom) Clausen 15 monthsago, he and his two top aides, Mr. Coleman and Frank Newman,the chief financial officer, have embarked on a strategy ofquickly becoming the dominant Western bank, with the intentof later expanding to other regions. Since Mr. Rosenberg tookover, BankAmerica has acquired $14.5 billion of assets in sixother Western states, mostly by absorbing remnants ofinsolvent thrifts. As of June 30, the bank had total assetsof $113.2 billion, compared to Security Pacific's assets of$80.4 billion.   BankAmerica's intent to eventually become a nationalbranch bank was revealed by its failed bid to acquire theinsolvent Bank of New England earlier this year. It had thehighest monetary bid, but federal regulators rejected itbecause it had too many special conditions. Before therejection, a top official at BankAmerica said the bankintended to pursue nationwide branch banking as its goal,although the company might first spend some time securing itsWestern base.   The Security Pacific acquisition will do just that.   Mr. Rosenberg says his merger got underway when he calledMr. Smith about six months ago. The two CEOs conducted talksfor many weeks mainly between themselves, an unusualprocedure that may be the reason word never leaked out. Mr.Rosenberg's call was believed to be prompted by thedisclosure in January that Wells Fargo andamp; Co. had reached atentative deal to merge with Security Pacific, only to backaway when new loan problems arose at Security Pacific.   &quot;For Security, there was lots of disappointment that theWells deal failed, there's no doubt about it,&quot; says a personfamiliar with the talks.   Mr. Rosenberg says, &quot;we talked, discovered that we shareda similar vision of the future of the banking industry andhow best to approach it. We found that we had an affinity ofideas.&quot;   About six weeks ago, Mr. Rosenberg said, negotiationsreally heated up when he visited the Los Angeles Raidersfootball camp in Oxnard, north of Los Angeles. Mr. Smithjoined him for dinner. &quot;That evening Bob and I had one of ourmore serious discussions about combining, and things movedforward from there.&quot; Talks accelerated even more afterManufacturers Hanover and Chemical Banking disclosed theirmerger plans on July 15.   A number of secret code names were used by BankAmericaofficials during duediligence investigation of the loanportfolios, which took place last week at the Biltmore Hotelin Los Angeles and the RitzCarlton Hotel in San Francisco.For example, BankAmerica was referred to as &quot;Bear,&quot; andSecurity Pacific as &quot;Sunshine.&quot; Only very late in the gamedid BankAmerica call in its investment adviser, MorganStanley, for a fairness opinion.   Ironically, BankAmerica's acquisition of Security Pacificnow serves as a pre-emptive strike against Security Pacific'sformer suitor, Wells Fargo. Now, Wells Fargo's aggressiveChairman Carl Reichardt will be under pressure to acquire thefourth big California bank, First Interstate Bancorp of LosAngeles, to remain competitive with the new BankAmericajuggernaut. First Interstate has franchises in most of theWestern states, and Texas and Oklahoma, in addition to itsflagship California operation.   &quot;If Wells decided to make an offer, who would step in tooutbid them?&quot; asks a representative of one big FirstInterstate shareholder. &quot;This is becoming a tidal wave andthe stock-market responses are so strong, that you get leftfurther and further behind if you do nothing. I think thepressure is on Wells. They have the {First Interstate} gameall to themselves.&quot;   Mr. Reichardt couldn't be reached for comment, although hehas said repeatedly that cost-saving mergers will be the mainway banks can boost earnings over the next several years,given the poor outlook for loan growth. A Wells Fargospokeswoman said yesterday, &quot;We are always looking at themarket for mergers if it makes sense for us and ourshareholders.&quot; As for the BankAmerica merger, the spokesmansaid simply, &quot;We had two competitors before and now we haveone.&quot;   The statement seems to indicate Wells Fargo doesn't intendto launch a rival bid for Security Pacific. Such acounter-move is still possible, but would be difficult. Theagreement is definitive and BankAmerica and Security Pacificgranted each other options to buy large positions in eachother's shares, or so-called lock-outs, in the event of arival offer. The merger contract is &quot;ironclad,&quot; asserts oneadviser.   In a statement about the merger of BankAmerica andSecurity Pacific, First Interstate sounded a note similar tothat of Wells Fargo: &quot;The main difference we see is that wewill be competing with one name instead of two.&quot; The bankdeclined to comment on whether Wells Fargo will now haveheightened interest in acquiring First Interstate.   In trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, FirstInterstate stock closed at $33.875 a share, jumping $6.125.Wells Fargo stock rose $3.25 to close at $75.50.   Although BankAmerica's acquisition will greatly add to itsdominant position in California and Washington state, Mr.Rosenberg doesn't see any major antitrust problems. Thecombined company would have about 38% of the commercial-bankdeposits in California, but only half that share if thriftsand credit unions are counted. In Washington, the merged bankmight have to dispose of some assets, because its share oftotal deposits is so high.   Mr. Rosenberg said that competition from nonbankinstitutions, such as the financing arms of General Electricand General Motors and the deposit-taking of money marketmutual funds, is fierce. &quot;There is so much competition outthere,&quot; he said at the press conference yesterday. &quot;I thinkthere is an enlightened attitude in Washington, D.C., aboutthe competition in these markets.&quot;   But some smaller competitors said that the combination ofthe two giants will leave many towns with a single bank,raising the possibility that the new BankAmerica will be ableto lower its rates paid on deposits and raise interest rateson loans more easily.   &quot;One would have to guess it would affect competition, andthat in many cases it would lessen competition materially,&quot;says Elliot K. Knutson, chairman of Washington FederalSavings and Loan Association, a big thrift based in Seattle.   But Mr. Hanley, the Salomon analyst, said banks havesuffered from an inability to offset loan losses with anadequate return on assets, mainly because there are far toomany banks. BankAmerica's possible ability to create moreadvantageous pricing of deposits and loans &quot;is a positive interms of the U.S. banking system.&quot;   The acquisition will greatly expand BankAmerica'soperations in most of the eight Western states it currentlycovers and give it total equity capital of about $12 billion,well above regulatory requirements and the level of anycompetitor. BankAmerica will swap 0.88 of a share for each ofSecurity Pacific's shares, and pay a yearly dividend of 30cents on each of the new shares. In addition, for each shareof Security Pacific's preferred stock, it will swap one shareof its preferred stock. The deal is expected to take up tosix months to close. BankAmerica is also mulling a plan tospin off some or most of the combined entity's nonperformingassets into a separate company to help accelerate theirdisposal.   BankAmerica seems intent on executing at least part of theoriginal game plan of its founder, A.P. Giannini. Mr.Giannini attempted to forge a nationwide branch bank back inthe 1930s that would cater to regular depositors as well ascorporations. But he was eventually foiled by Congress andfederal regulators, who erected barriers to interstateexpansion.   BankAmerica's recent two-time chairman, Mr. Clausen,attempted to make BankAmerica a global bank, as big overseasas domestically, catering to developing nations and majormultinational corporations. The expansion brought BankAmericahuge losses from 1985 to 1987 when overseas companies andThird World countries defaulted on their loans.   While BankAmerica is fine-tuning its overseas operationsand expanding the banking services it sells tomultinationals, its broader plan is to grow rapidly in theU.S. through nationwide branch banking. That idea was firstproposed by Mr. Giannini in 1924, and he never made any bonesabout it. At a Congressional hearing in May 1930, at thebeginning of the Depression, he was asked by alarmedrepresentatives what should be done to shore up the shakybanking system. Mr. Giannini replied: &quot;Branch banking,nationwide and worldwide.&quot;   If Mr. Rosenberg has his way, BankAmerica will accomplishat least half that goal. &quot;This merger only enhances ourability to expand,&quot; he said yesterday.   ---   Fred R.
