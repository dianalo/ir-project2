Closing Date: Requests to participate in the hearing as a party must bereceived by the Docket Clerk August 8, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2>Docket Clerk, HCFA Hearing Staff,300 East High Rise, 6325 Security Boulevard, Baltimore, Maryland 21207,Telephone: (301) 966-4471.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>This notice announces an administrativehearing to reconsider our decision to disapprove a portion of New YorkState plan amendment number 85-25.Section 1116 of the Social Security Act and 42 CFR Part 430 establish Departmentprocedures that provide an administrative hearing for reconsideration ofa disapproval of a State plan or plan amendment. HCFA is required to publisha copy of the notice to a State Medicaid Agency that informs the agencyof the time and place of the hearing and the issues to be considered. (Ifwe subsequently notify the agency of additional issues that will be consideredat the hearing, we will also publish that notice.)Any individual or group that wants to participate in the hearing as a partymust petition the Hearing Officer within 15 days after publication of thisnotice, in accordance with the requirements contained in 42 CFR 430.76(b)(2).Any interested person or organization that wants to participate in amicuscuriae must petition the Hearing Officer before the hearing begins in accordancewith the requirements contained in 42 CFR 430.76(c).If the hearing is later rescheduled, the Hearing Officer will notify allparticipants.New York SPA 85-25 included more liberal income and resource methods fordetermining eligibility for the medically needy. The State requested bothmoratorium protection for the amendment and approval under section 1902(r)(2)of the Social Security Act (the Act); however, moratorium protection wasnot necessary since the State only requested that the SPA be effectivethe first day of the quarter it was submitted. The issues in this matterare: (1) Whether the State's more liberal income methods violate the Federalfinancial participation (FFP) limits under section 1903(f) of the Act,and must, therefore, be disapproved because approval would not be consistentwith sections 1902(a)(4) and 1902(a)(19) of the Act and (2) whether approvalof more liberal income and resource standards (rather than methodologies)is permitted under section 1902(r)(2) of the Act.Subject to certain specified FFP limits under section 1903(f) of the Act,States may use income and resource eligibility methods which are more liberalthan those used under the most closely related cash assistance program(Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) and Supplemental SecurityIncome (SSI)). This option is available under section 1902(r)(2) of theAct (added by the Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act (MCCA) of 1988) andwas available under section 2373(c) of the Deficit Reduction Act of 1984.Because FFP limits contained in section 1903(f) remain unchanged, HCFAhas determined that application of more liberal income methods under colorof section 1902(r)(2) (or the moratorium) to those eligiblility groupswhich are subject to section 1903(f) limits can result impermissibly inthese limits being exceeded.New York SPA 85-25 proposed the following more liberal income deductions:andbullet; For AFDC-related medically needy, an earned income deduction madefor payments under the Federal Insurance Contribution Act in addition toFederal mandated work expenses deductions.andbullet; For SSI-related medically needy, New York State Disability Payments(NYSD) deducted when FICA, NYSD and income tax deductions total more than$65. When these amounts exceed $65 the total of these deductions is madeinstead of the standard $65 work expense deduction under SSI.andbullet; For all medically needy, in-kind support except when providedby legally responsible relatives for services rendered.These policies were disapproved because HCFA determined that the FFP limitscould be exceeded. Disapproval authority is found under sections 1902(a)(4) and (19) of the Act. Under section 1902(a)(4), a State's plan mustprovide for such methods of administration as are found by the Secretaryto be necessary for the proper and efficient operation of the plan. Webelieve the decision not to approve policies which will result in FFP limitsbeing exceeded is consistent with this requirement as it is the most efficientmanner of handling the interface between the eligibility requirements andthe FFP limits. Under section 1902(a)(19), the plan must provide safeguardsthat are necessary to assure that eligibility for care and services underthe plan will be determined, and such care and services will be provided,in a manner consistent with simplicity of administration and best interestof recipients.New York SPA 85-25 also proposed a method for counting income and resourcesfor SSI-related medically needy pursuant to a court suit, <T3>Rickey </T3>v. <T3>Perales. </T3>This method would compare net income and resources foran aged, blind or disabled person to the higher of the medical assistancestandard of need or public assistance standard of need for a householdsize which includes the SSI-related person and those persons for whom she/heis legally responsible (i.e., a spouse and/or dependent child under 21living in the home). Section 1902(r)(2) allows States to use more liberalincome methods subject to FFP limits. It does not, however, extend to moreliberal standards. Therefore, in addition to exceeding FFP limits, HCFAdetermined that the policy is inconsistent with the provisions of section1902(r)(2) because it calls for using more liberal standards and violatessection 1902(a)(10)(C)(i)(III). This section requires that a single incomeand resource standard be used to determine eligibility for the medicallyneedy. The proposed policy calls for variable standards.The policy also calls for a more liberal method of treating resources thanused under SSI methods. HCFA believes the policy, as written, is not approvablebecause it calls for using more liberal standards which exceed the authorityof section 1902(r)(2) and it violates the single standard provision ofsection 1902(a)(10)(C)(i)(III). As noted above, this section of law requireStates to use a single income and resource standard for the medically needy.The proposed policy calls for variable standards.The notice to New York announcing an administrative hearing to reconsiderthe partial disapproval of its State plan amendment reads as follows:<ITAG tagnum="26">Ms. Susan V.
