But these days, the career earth scientist takes greatdelight in showing off just how backward his domain is. Inone laboratory, he cautions a visitor to avoid the spaghettiof wires dangling from the ceiling and scattered on thefloor. In another, he points to a collection of mirrors usedto bend lasers around the room because there isn't enoughspace to shoot them straight. He squirms while walkingthrough the biophysics lab to avoid knocking down the beakers-- converted from old milk bottles -- filled with insects.That room is even more crowded when the fire inspectors come,Dr. Kushiro explains, because researchers have to move backall the equipment illegally stored in hallways.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;Describe the problems you have,&quot; he cajoles a young,white-smocked chemistry researcher, who recites on cue how hemust carry vacuum-sealed packages down several flights ofstairs and into the next building to complete his tests.   This isn't conventional Japanese humility. Dr. Kushiro andhis counterparts at Japan's major universities have launcheda high-profile campaign over the past year to shore upJapan's notoriously backward basic-science facilities, whichstand in shocking contrast to the world-leading appliedresearch conducted at the country's gleaming corporate labs.Now, just as the Japanese government finally seems willing toreverse years of financial neglect, President Bush is comingto town next week asking Japan to pledge more than $1 billionof scarce science funding to a U.S.-ledsuperconductor-supercollider complex under construction inWaxahachie, near Dallas, Texas.   &quot;From the point of view of basic research, we have noobjection&quot; to the project, says Dr. Kushiro. But if the moneycomes out of Japan's own science funding, he adds, &quot;then itis a serious problem.&quot; A recent article in Toyo Keizai, arespected weekly economic magazine, carried the headline:&quot;Save Japanese Universities Instead of Bush.&quot;   The SSC, as it's called, is the ultimate big,basic-science project. It is based on the idea that smashingtogether protons, each charged with 20 trillion electronvolts, at high speeds through a ring 86 kilometers (53.3miles) in circumference will enable analysis of particlesdown to a billionth of a billionth of a centimeter andprovide clues to the origin of the universe. It will cost$8.5 billion to build.   The Bush administration has declared this a top priority,and with congressional pressure to cap federal funding at $5billion, it needs Japan to make the SSC a big priority, too.Other potential funding sources can't or won't help: Europehas its own big atom-smasher project and wants to buildanother; the former Soviet Union is broke. Without Japanesefinancing, the project could well collapse. At least threetop U.S. officials over the past three months have pleadedfor such help during Tokyo visits. President Bush made directappeals during his last few face-to-face meetings withJapanese leaders.   If for no other reason than to appease President Bushduring a summit meeting marked by bilateral economictensions, Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa will probably givesome positive response. No details have been formallyannounced yet. But it will probably involve creating abilateral &quot;working group.&quot; One Japanese newspaper reportedearlier this week that Mr. Miyazawa has also decided topromise 200 billion yen ($1.59 billion) over seven yearsstarting April 1, 1993. But even if true, it isn't clearwhether he has rallied the necessary support. Some governmentofficials say no dollar figure will be offered during theBush visit.   The SSC debate comes as the two countries are strugglingto define an appropriate cooperative scientific relationship.The Japanese resent the fact that the U.S. only came lookingfor a &quot;partnership&quot; after shaping the SSC project. Theycomplain of an underlying U.S. attitude that, when it comesto science, Japan is good mainly for money. The Japanese werealso irritated last year when Congress, temporarily, slashedfunding for the space station that the Japanese had agreed tohelp fund. U.S. scientists have also pressured Japan to aidthe &quot;human genome&quot; project aimed at mapping the human geneticsystem.   As a quid pro quo for SSC funding, the U.S. is finallyagreeing to support Japanese-initiated international scienceprojects -- albeit at a tiny fraction of the cost of Japan'sprospective SSC contribution. Over the past five years, Japanhas unveiled a series of such programs and has almost alwaysbeen rebuffed by Americans suspicious that it was trying to&quot;buy&quot; more-advanced foreign work. But this month, the U.S.and several other nations are expected to announce supportfor Japan's program for studying the human brain.   But the fundamental scientific tension remains -- thatJapan focuses on proprietary profitable research while&quot;freeloading&quot; on the West's open, basic research. That,Japanese scientists argue, won't change unless they shore uptheir own universities.   A big problem is money. Japanese public universities haveonly recently changed their historical prohibition on takingcorporate funds, and the level is still quite low. Japanesecompanies have endowed more than 20 professorships at theMassachusetts Institute of Technology, for example, but onlyfive chairs in science and engineering at Tokyo University.   That leaves mainly government funding, but that pool ofmoney is relatively low and dropped sharply during thetight-budget 1980s, when Japan's financial bureaucrats werecommitted to wiping out government debt. Japanese scientistslike to roll out the following statistics: The annual SSCfunding requested by the U.S. would equal half the Ministryof Education's grant budget; Japanese government spending onbasic science makes up only 0.45% of gross national product,compared with 1.25% for the U.S. (GNP measures the value of anation's output of goods and services); 1990 governmentspending on educational facilites was 84 billion yen, justmore than half the 1980 level and about equal to 1974spending, unadjusted for inflation; Japanese governmentresearch and development spending is less than one-fifthJapanese corporate spending, compared with a 50-50 split inthe U.S. and France.   The result, scientists say, is shoddy, cramped facilitieswith outdated equipment. Some labs don't have heat; oneprofessor says he can't turn the air conditioning below 30degrees Celsius (86 degrees Fahrenheit) during Tokyo'ssweltering hot season if he wants enough electricity to powerhis equipment. The support staff, such as clerks, techniciansand secretaries, is shrinking, forcing younger researchers --and often professors -- to do routine, clerical work.   But money isn't the only problem. Many of the sameattributes credited for Japan's smooth-running economy oftenapply to scientific researchers -- and are blamed forstifling creativity. Young scientists are beholden to olderresearchers, move up by seniority and are discouraged fromdebating research. Japan has won only a half-dozen scientificNobel Prizes -- compared with more than 100 by the U.S. Fouryears ago, when Susumu Tonegawa became the first Japanese towin the Nobel Prize in medicine, he used the opportunity toblast Japan's science system. Now a professor at MIT, hecredited his quarter-century of work in the U.S. and said henever could have done it had he stayed at home.   Now, however, pressure for change is building. Severalgovernment and industry groups have called for doublinggovernment spending on basic science to 1% of GNP. Skepticsdoubt that will ever happen, but the Miyazawa cabinet'sproposed budget last month for the year beginning April 1calls for boosting science and education spending by 5.4% ina total budget increasing by 2.7%. The education minister,after getting the horror tour last year from Tokyo UniversityPresident Akito Arima, was so stunned that he pledged moneyfor a new physics building within two years, Dean Kushirosays.   Last year, a group of powerful Diet (Japan's parliament)members formed a special committee to promote boostingbasicscience spending. The universities also are trying tooverhaul their stifling structure.   Some Japanese suggest that U.S. SSC pressure, rather thandiverting money, may actually be helping to give a lift toJapan's basic-science facilities by focusing attention on theissue. &quot;Every year the situation is deteriorating, but theSSC has triggered this discussion anew,&quot; says a ForeignMinistry scientific-affairs official. &quot;We had to think aboutwhat are our priorities in the area of basic research.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
