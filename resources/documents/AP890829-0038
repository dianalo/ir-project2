Divison Gen. Jose Abrantes Fernandez also faces demotion fromgeneral to private, the news agency said in a dispatch monitoredMonday in Mexico City. The dispatch did not say when a verdict wasexpected.   Abrantes was tried on charges of abusing power, neglecting hisduties and enriching himself by stealing from the government, PrensaLatina said.   Prosecutors requested the stiff sentence Sunday at the end offour days of testimony before a military tribunal.   The trial is the latest chapter in a drug trafficking scandalthat has shaken the Caribbean island, disrupted the nation'sreputation for communist discipline, and sent four officers to thefiring squad. One of them was a highly decorated war hero.   The tribunal also was asked for sentences ranging from eight to15 years in prison for six other ministry officials, including theformer vice interior minister and the former head of customs, thenews agency said.   The defendants are accused of using their government posts forprivate gain; the prosecution asked the tribunal to confiscate theprofits.   Castro fired Abrantes as interior minister in June, when 12military officers from the ministry and two from the army werecharged with drug smuggling and other crimes. Four were executed andthe others are serving up to 30 years in prison.   The prosecution said Abrantes fumbled the drug-traffickinginvestigation so badly that his mistakes appeared deliberate, but itsaid the evidence did not support a charge of treason, Prensa Latinasaid.   Abrantes knew as early as February that officials of his ministrywere involved in drug trafficking but did nothing about it, theprosecution charged.   Castro had personally ordered Abrantes to conduct theinvestigation after persistent reports that tons of Colombiancocaine and Jamaican marijuana were moving through Cuba to theUnited States.   The prosecution asked the tribunal to sentence the former viceinterior minister, Division Gen. Pascual Martinez Gil, to 15 yearsand demote him to private for abuse of power and stealing from thegovernment.   It requested a 13-year sentence for bribery and abuse of powerfor Lt. Col. Oscar Carreno Gomez, former head of customs, and saidhe should be demoted to the rank of foot soldier.   Abrantes, Carreno Gomez and four others are accused of takingmoney from some of the officers arrested in June. Prensa Latina saidAbrantes allegedly accumulated millions of dollars in an illegalfund set up at the ministry.   The chief prosecutor, Felipe Aleman Cruz, said he was so consumedwith ``dollar fever'' that he traded Cuban pesos on the black marketfor his own profit.   Castro, who has for years denied U.S. charges of Cuban complicityin the drug trade, said the officers involved in narcotics weretraitors to his cause.</TEXT></DOC>
