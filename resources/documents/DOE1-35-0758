In this invention, by placing a transparentspacer between the back surface electrode and photo-electric conversionlayer, the film thickness of n-type amorphous semi-conductor layer couldbe made as thin as 1/5 - 1/10 of the conventional type. This enabledto obtain a solar cell with high photo-electric conversion efficiencyby considerably reducing the optical loss. (5 figs, 1 tab)</TEXT></DOC>
