An investor group led by Andrew N. Heine, chairman and chiefexecutive officer of the national car-parking company Kinney SystemInc., said in a brief statement that it offered $25 a share foreach of Fischbach's approximately 3.91 million common shares.   Edwin Wilinski, Fischbach executive vice president, said he hadno comment on the offer.   The announcement caused Fischbach's stock to surge $2.87{ ashare to $17.50 on the New York Stock Exchange.   Fischbach, one of the nation's largest electrical contractors,drew prominent attention in April 1987 because it was identified bythe federal government as the object of a criminal conspiracydescribed in a guilty plea by Boesky, the former stock speculatornow serving a three-year prison term.   The conspiracy concerned stock parking, a fraudulent practice inwhich the ownership of stock is disguised in someone else's name.Stock parking can be used to avoid reporting requirements to theSecurities and Exchange Commission and to quietly accumulate stockfor hostile takeovers.   Earlier this month, the SEC alleged as part of a massivesecurities fraud complaint against Drexel that its high-yield bondchief Michael Milken and Posner, a Miami industrialist, wereco-conspirators in the Fischbach stock-parking arrangement withBoesky.   The SEC said the alleged arrangement enabled Posner toultimately acquire a controlling interest in Fischbach and becomechairman. The defendants in the SEC case have denied theaccusations.   In a telephone interview, Heine called his offer friendly andunsolicited. He also said the offer and its timing were unrelatedto the SEC case against Drexel and the others, but ``obviously,we're aware of all that.''   Heine declined to identify his associates in the takeover offerbut said it had nothing to do with Kinney, which he once helpedacquire via a leveraged buyout, a transaction in which buyers useborrowed money and repay it with the acquired company's assets orearnings.   He said the Fischbach transaction also would be structured as aleveraged buyout but declined to specify if he would sell any ofthe company's assets to finance it.   ``I really don't want to go into a game plan at this time,'' hesaid.   Based in New York, Fischbach has about 80 offices and 9,000employees nationwide. It earned about $36 million on revenue of$1.1 billion last year.</TEXT></DOC>
