In a 5-0 vote, the agency eliminated the requirement thatthe Bell companies operate information services, such asvoicemail or electronic messaging, through separatesubsidiaries. It also required the Bell companies to getpermission from large business customers before using theirtelephone records for marketing purposes. And it launched aninquiry to see whether the Bell companies should be requiredto offer advanced telecommunications technology tocompetitors who could use that technology to improve theirown information services.</LP><TEXT>   The FCC action comes as part of a massive redesign of theU.S. telecommunications network. Under the new rules, theBell companies must provide the services needed bycommunications networks on a kind of &quot;a la carte&quot; basis,enabling companies to buy just the services they want.Historically, Bell companies have bundled together a varietyof services, requiring companies to pay for services theymight not want.   The FCC has made the unbundling of services a quid-pro-quofor allowing the Bell companies to offer information servicesthemselves, rather than through separate subsidiaries; theBell companies say the separate-subsidiaries requirementhindered their marketing activities.   Competitors contend that the Bell companies will use theunbundling as way to raise prices -- especially to businessesthat provide news, information and other services to computerusers.   Nevertheless, FCC Chairman Alfred Sikes said therestructuring is necessary to shake out subsidies betweendifferent services in a system that dates from the time whenthe Bell companies were a part of American Telephone andamp;Telegraph Inc. Under the system being replaced, telephonerates are &quot;the American version of old-style Soviet pricing-- heavily affected by government direction based on socialgoals,&quot; he said.   The Bell companies generally applauded the elimination ofthe separate-subsidiary rule. The FCC had scrapped therequirement previously, but an appeals court in San Franciscolast year overturned the commission's ruling because it saidthe agency hadn't explained its rationale sufficiently. Theagency argued that a complex set of accounting rules it hasestablished will enable it to police the Bell companiesadequately, making the subsidiaries unnecessary.   Unless the decision is overturned again in the courts, theBell companies will be free to start offering informationservices as part of their mainstream business beginning inFebruary. That's when the rates for their unbundled servicesare expected to be approved.   Bell company competitors said the new FCC rules are toolax. &quot;The safeguards haven't evolved to the point where thereis a technological level playing field,&quot; said Richard Wiley,a former FCC chairman, who represents some Bell companycompetitors.   The Bell companies and their competitors also splitsharply over the FCC's other actions. The agency voted torequire that Bell companies, for the first time, getauthorization to use subscriber information for marketingpurposes from any customer that uses more than 20 telephonelines. Information on calling patterns is valuable tobusinesses looking to sell such services as call-forwardingsystems. Bell Atlantic Corp. complained that the requirement&quot;will only confuse and inconvenience our customers.&quot;   But the Bell companies still wouldn't need anyauthorization to use information from smaller businesses orresidential telephone customers, even though theircompetitors would. The result, according to Joseph Markowski,an attorney for a trade group of computer-service companiescalled ADAPSO, would be a &quot;significant advantage&quot; for theBell companies in marketing voice-mail services to smallcompanies and individuals.</TEXT></DOC>
