He was ready for Iowa, but Iowa wasn't ready for him.   Jobs were scarce. So was optimism. People were moving out,merchants were following. But over time, misery has given way tomending.   Iowa, a state that once typified the decline and despair of ruralAmerica, is on the rebound. Consider Keitel, an Iowa native whoreturned to a state thousands fled, found work where two years agothere was none, and is praising a land that not long ago was pitied.   ``I think this place is a gold mine,'' says Keitel, a 36-year-oldengineer who grew up on an eastern Iowa farm.   ``The Iowa economy is coming on strong,'' boasts Gov. TerryBranstad. ``We know we still have a long way to go, but we've come along ways.''   Unemployment is down, revenues are up and there's a sense theworst is over. Some claim a bust-to-boom assessment is too rosy andpremature, but the declining dollar, export opportunities, pricesupports and a diversifying economy have contributed to aturnaround. Consider:   _ The value of Iowa farmland rose 20.4 percent in 1988, promptingthe Des Moines Register headline ``Iowa Dirt Turns to Gold Again.''The increase, reported in an Iowa State University study, was thelargest since the mid-1970s. From 1981 to 1986, land values hadplummeted 63 percent.   _ Iowa's labor force reached an all-time high in October: 1.5million people working or seeking jobs. Unemployment was 3.5percent, the lowest since November 1979. In some areas, jobsoutnumber residents. Mount Pleasant has about 5,000 people ofworking age but almost 12,000 jobs.   Iowa soon plans to set up a nationwide toll-free number to lureback ex-Iowans who left in search of work.   _ Iowa is expected to have a $180 million budget surplus in the1989 and 1990 fiscal years, a panel of financial experts said inDecember, although some of that will likely be eaten up with federalmandates.   _ One in five Iowa farmers has substantial money troubles, downfrom one in three in 1984-85, said Neil Harl, an Iowa Stateeconomics professor.   _ Deere andamp; Co., the state's largest private employer with 14,800workers, posted record fourth-quarter and year-end earnings.   _ After six years in which Iowa lost almost 100,000 people, theCensus Bureau reported last month state population increased by11,000 from 1987 to 1988.   Despite such numbers, some say last summer's drought will have alingering impact. They also worry the state's upturn is bypassingrural areas where schools have closed, young people have departedand Main Street merchants have closed up shop.   ``We haven't turned the corner yet by any means,'' said DaveOstendorf of Prairiefire, a rural advocacy group. ``Many of therural counties still have poverty rates exceeding 20 percent.''   Branstad says, though, that no state enjoys ``uniform prosperity.What we want to do is help those areas that aren't doing as well tohelp themselves.''   The state uses lottery proceeds, for instance, for economicdevelopment, some of the money going for loans, aid to localcommunities or research projects.   Already, the upswing and growth in the meat packing and farmequipment industries have helped hard-hit blue-collar areas. InWaterloo, unemployment fell from 8.8 percent last January to 4.3percent in November.   ``People feel we've bottomed out,'' said Jim Lawrence, presidentof the Waterloo Chamber of Commerce.   Deere, which has a giant local operation, has recalled workers; aleather processing plant recently opened, and a new IBP Inc. hogslaughtering plant is being built, Lawrence said.   In Mason City, about 1,500 new jobs, many of them service sectorand health-related, will be created in 1989 alone, compared withabout 2,000 in the last five years combined, said Tom Jolas, aneconomic development consultant to the city.   Iowa's recovery is due, in part, to a declining dollar that makesgrain and other products more competitive on the world market, saidstate economist Harvey Siegelman.   ``There will be Winnebagos going to Europe, beef to Japan andDeere tractors all over the world,'' he said.   Just as critical is Iowa's effort to reduce its reliance onagriculture.   ``The key to success is diversification,'' Branstad said. ``Someof it actually is building off the agricultural economy that alreadyexists and finding new uses for products.''   Branstad said Iowa has also targeted several industries fordevelopment: telecommunications, biotechnology, pharmaceuticals andinsurance. Des Moines already is an insurance capital.   Mount Pleasant, 28 miles from the Mississippi River, learned todiversify decades ago. It's paid off. The town's business rosterincludes such corporate names as Motorola, Cargill and Goodyear. AWal-Mart distribution center opened in 1985.   Mount Pleasant is also home to a large fireplace maker, a bulkmail distributor that claims more outgoing postage volume than LasVegas, and a school bus manufacturer.   ``We set an example of how we can control our own future,'' saidGlenda Griffin, the local chamber's vice president. ``We appreciatethe help of the state and federal government, but we will not sitback and depend on them.''   Mount Pleasant never hit the depths some Iowa communities sank toin the mid-1980s, though the county unemployment rate was 8.1percent in 1982-83. In November, it was 2.5 percent.   In the last six months, two motels, four stores and a truck stophave opened. Officials say property values rose from $45 million to$130 million in the last decade; retail sales jumped 18.7 percentfrom March 1986 to March 1988.   Mount Pleasant has also held onto its young people, offering jobsinvolving computers and lasers.   ``There isn't a small town in the state of Iowa that has any moresophisticated industry than we have,'' said Mayor Tom Vilsack.   Keitel returned from Saudia Arabia in 1986, ending up as anengineer in Connecticut when he couldn't find work in Iowa. Lastfall he found a job in Mount Pleasant.   ``Iowa still has a lot to offer, even with all of its problems,''he said. ``We haven't lost our sense of values. The quality of lifestill means more than the almighty dollar.''   Vilsack has another explanation:   ``We can't do a lot about what's plaguing the small-town farmer.We've given families the opportunity to be in control of their ownlives. Iowa's got to take its destiny in its own hands.''</TEXT><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE><TEXT>   Sharon Cohen is the AP Midwest regionalcorrespondent, based in Chicago.</TEXT></DOC>
