The search for Sue Curtis, who vanished in 1975 from the BrighamYoung University campus in Provo, was focused on three dirt roadsabout 10 miles southeast of the city of Price, said Sheriff's ChiefDeputy Jerry Cowan.   Searchers used metal detectors because the victim wore braces andin case she was wearing jewelry.   The detectors picked up faint signals, said Joe Ward, a member ofthe search team, but the frozen ground covered with 10 inches ofsnow was too hard to dig.   ``The search will continue until the remains are found, but untilthe snow melts it is doubtful we will have any success,'' saidSheriff Barry Bryner.   Ward also said he had remembered hunting in the area years ago _possibly around the time of Curtis' disappearance _ and finding abloody pair of women's underwear. He said he didn't think much of itat the time, but recalled it Friday and led searchers to a spotabout a quarter-mile from a dirt road.   In the days before his execution Tuesday for the murder of a12-year-old Florida girl, Bundy confessed to at least 23 murders inUtah, Idaho, Washington and Colorado.   The FBI said Friday that law-enforcement agents are being invitedto a meeting in Quantico, Va., in of clearing up murders Bundy isbelieve to have committed.   ``It's easier to answer if everybody is in one place so we candiscuss the peculiarities in each case,'' said Terry Green, an FBImajor case specialist.   Using a page torn from an atlas, Bundy directed investigators tolook for Curtis' grave between Price and Green River. ``About 200yards in on the dirt road ... and to the left, maybe 50 yards,d, eleventh-hour confession, Bundy also saidhe dumped another body into the Colorado River, identifying thevictim as Denise Oliverson, 24, who was last seen riding her bicyclein April 1975 near her home in Grand Junction, Colo.   Sgt. Greg Kuhn of the Grand Junction Police Department said thatofficials will listen to the tape and talk to the investigator whointerviewed Bundy. Police probably will decide Monday whether tosearch for the body, he said.   In Idaho, authorities said they do not have enough information tosearch for bodies in two killings Bundy said he committed.   Russ Reneau, the Idaho investigator who interviewed Bundy overthe weekend in Florida, said Bundy confessed to killing LynetteCulver, 12, and throwing her body into a river but could not providean exact location.   Reneau said Bundy also confessed that in 1974 he picked up ayoung woman at a freeway exit near Boise, killed her and threw thebody into a river. The victim's identity is unknown.   Meanwhile, authorities in Wayne County, Utah, planned to scout asite 10 miles east of Capital Reef National Park, where Bundyclaimed to have buried the body of Nancy Wilcox, 17, of Holladay,who disappeared Oct. 2, 1974.   A rancher told authorities that in 1974, he saw a man in a suitstanding along the road near the area Bundy detailed, and when hedrove by the man turned his back.   The sheriff, the rancher and a few deputies were to check thesite and decide whether to mount a full-scale search, said ChiefDeputy Leeon Brinkerhoff.   Bundy also said he buried the body of Debi Kent, who vanished in1974 from a Bountiful, Utah, high school parking lot, betweenFairview and Mayfield. Bountiful Police Chief Larry Higgins said hisofficers would visit the area Saturday.   During an interview with a Utah detective last weekend, Bundymentioned eight killings in Utah, but authorities have been able tolink him to only five in the mid-1970s, when he was a University ofUtah law student.   The Curtis girl had left a Mormon youth conference at thechurch-owned school to walk to her dormitory room June 28, 1975, andnever was seen again.   ``There were absolutely no leads as to where she was at,''University Police Chief Robert Kelshaw said Friday.   In the hour before his death, Bundy apparently requested a taperecorder and a map from the Florida State Prison warden as he waitedin the ``ready cell'' 30 feet from the electric chair and describedthe Curtis slaying.   ``That's a typical pattern of Bundy _ unpredictable,'' said SaltLake County Sheriff Pete Hayward. ``Something struck a note in him,I guess.''   Cowan said the girl's parents live in Wellington, four miles fromthe search area, and were ``just as upset as when it firsthappened.''</TEXT></DOC>
