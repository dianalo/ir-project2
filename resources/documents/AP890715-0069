Prosecutors were rebuffed by the Bush administration when theyattempted to turn over the copies to the NSC staff last month,administration and congressional sources say.   The administration is concerned that once the security councilregains possession, Congress can move to have the long sought-afterdocuments declassified, an administration source acknowledged.   The Justice Department is looking at legal questions surroundinga possible transfer of the spiral-bound notebooks, departmentspokesman David Runkel said. North still holds the originals.   According to sources, independent counsel Lawrence Walsh assuredSenate Foreign Relations Committee chairman Claiborne Pell in aletter June 23 that the prosecutor would send copies of thenotebooks to the NSC so that they might be made available toCongress.   The Senate panel has been trying since April 1988 to subpoena thenotebooks, which North took with him the day he was fired from theNSC on Nov. 25, 1986. His lawyers blacked out portions of 1,269 ofthe 2,848 pages of copies supplied to the Iran-Contra investigatingcommittees.   The books contain North's hand-written, daily records of meetingsand phone calls about the Iran arms sales and secret assistance tothe Contras. They also contain references to allegations ofnarcotics trafficking in connection with various arms dealers whowere supplying the Contras.   During Walsh's investigation of North, North invoked his FifthAmendment right against self-incrimination in initially refusing toturn them over. But North had to submit them three months ago whenhe decided to testify near the close of his criminal trial.   Pell, D-Rhode Island, pressed Walsh for copies in a letter June20, to which Walsh responded three days later.   ``It is my understanding that the National Security Councilrergards these notebooks as its documents,'' Walsh said. ``We shallsupply a copy of these documents to the National Security Councilalong with a copy of your letter expressing a need for them.   ``It would then be appropriate for ... your Counsel ... torequest the declassification of these documents so that they couldbe utilized by the Committee.''   A courier from the independent counsel's office subsequentlytried to deliver the copies, said one source familiar with theepisode.   When NSC staffers opened a package containing the copies, ``theyrefused to take custody of them, saying they're not the property ofthe NSC,'' said the source.   ``It was somebody's assumption at the independent counsel'soffice that `If we send it, they'll take it,''' said oneadministration source familiar with the matter.   ``Some of the concern has to do with distribution after they getto the executive branch,'' one Bush administration officialacknowledged, referring to Congress' interest in obtaining thenotebooks.   Runkel of the Justice Department said there has been ``nodetermination about what should be done'' with the prosecutors'copies ``or whether we should seek to get the notebooks back fromNorth himself.''   Runkel declined further comment. At Walsh's office, spokeswomanMary Belcher declined all comment on the notebooks.   North was compelled to produce them to prosecutors under an April6 court order by U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell.   One question is whether Gesell intended to restrict theindependent counsel's authority to turn its copies over to someoneelse, said one Bush administration official.   ``This can be simply resolved: go ask Judge Gesell,'' said theofficial. ``The independent counsel is afraid North is going toobject. The right way is to give notice that they would be inclinedto turn over the notebooks to the NSC and give North a chance to beheard.''   The wording of Gesell's order places no restrictions on whatWalsh may do with the notebooks.   It says simply that North ``shall forthwith produce to theGovernment ... Spiral bound notebooks used ... in the course of,and-or to assist him in, his duties at the National SecurityCouncil'' from October 1984 to Nov. 25, 1986.   Ultimately, ownership of the the notebooks will have to bedetermined, said another administration source.   ``If they are presidential records, they probably belong to theReagan administration and would go to the Reagan library inCalifornia,'' said the Bush administration source. ``It's prettyclear the documents don't belong to this administration. They're notBush presidency documents.''   North testified in his trial that he regarded the notebooks ashis personal property and that he had intended to destroy them asone of his last acts at the NSC.   North testified that he took them away with him the day he wasfired because his lawyer at the time, Thomas Green, had advised himto do so.   ``I was advised to keep things that would indicate that I hadauthority'' from Reagan administration higher-ups for his activitiesin the Iran-Contra affair, said North, who was convicted of threefelonies in the scandal.   Prosecutors at his trial were able to make almost no use of thethousands of pages of notebooks in cross-examining North because hehad been forced to give them the material only a few days earlier.
