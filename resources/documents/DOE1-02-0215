<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-02-0215 </DOCNO><TEXT>A wellhead power system is one that utilizes the flow from a single wellor a pair of adjacent wells to generate electrical power right at thewellhead, eliminating the need to transport the hot geothermal fluidfrom well to plant and having a plant size small enough to facilitateuse of shop-fabricated, truck-transportable major subsystems or components.Wellhead systems will be in the 1 to 10 or 15 MW(e) size range. Currentprojects being performed as part of the wellhead systems subprogram inthe EPRI Geothermal Power Systems Program are described below. Theseprojects involve development of the following technologies: rotary separatorturbine (RST), upstream reboiler for noncondensable gas removal, combustion-geothermalhybrid and modular wellhead binary. 19 references, 2 figures.</TEXT></DOC>
