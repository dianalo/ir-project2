(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Jim Bakker may have begun at PTL as a``man of good deeds'' but soon became a ``world-class master'' ofhalf truths to obtain power and wealth, a prosecutor said today atthe evangelist's fraud trial.   ``What has unfolded before you the last month is a tale ofcorruption _ immense corruption,'' prosecutor Deborah Smith saidduring closing arguments.   Bakker scribbled notes on a yellow legal pad and occasionallyglanced at Ms. Smith.   ``There may have been a time when Mr. Bakker was a man of gooddeeds back in the 1970s, but as time progressed into the 1980s, hebegan to use people to obtain possessions and power and keep it,''she said.   Bakker's lawyer was to deliver his closing argument later in theday. Jury deliberations in the federal court trial were expected tobegin as early as Wednesday.   Ms. Smith described Bakker as a ``world-class master of usinghalf truths. He lied to people, he used half truths to manipulatepeople. He used his position to maintain his power and wealth.''   Bakker completed his testimony Monday by accusing the Rev. JerryFalwell of cheating PTL followers and by conceding he and his wifeaccepted millions in bonuses as the ministry's finances foundered.   ``The real conspiracy to defraud came from that group of peoplewho took over the ministry for their own selfish gains,'' saidBakker, who invited Falwell to take over the ministry when heresigned in 1987 in a sex and money scandal.   Bakker also denied the prosecutor's assertion that he failed totell PTL board members about the ministry's money problems.   ``I don't know how the board members could not be aware of thefinancial crisis at Heritage USA,'' he testified. ``They knew wehad cash flow problems and they voted to borrow funds to pay forthem.''   Bakker, 49, is charged with 24 counts of fraud and conspiracy.He is accused of diverting more than $3.7 million in PTL money forhis own benefit.   If convicted on all counts, he could be sentenced to 120 yearsin prison and fined more than $5 million.   Ms. Smith asked Bakker to explain apparent contradictionsbetween his story and testimony and exhibits presented by thegovernment, including former PTL board members who said they didn'tremember voting on some of the large bonuses for Bakker and hiswife.   Bakker said Falwell and his attorney, Norman Roy Grutman, hadintimidated the directors.   ``Norman Roy Grutman and Jerry Falwell threatened those boardmembers that they would be in terrible danger,'' Bakker testified.Among the threats, Bakker said, was that the directors might beliable to a civil suit.   Bakker said he and his wife, Tammy Faye, accepted $3.1 millionin bonuses in the mid-1980s as the ministry's finances ran intotrouble. He said the bonuses amounted to less than 1 percent of themore than $425 million he raised for the ministry.   Asked by his lawyer what he did with the $425 million, Bakkerreplied, ``I put it to the work of Jesus Christ.''   Board members granted the bonuses ``of their own free will,''Bakker said, and often told him he was ``worth much more than this,and they would say that over and over again.''   Bakker, who began his testimony Friday, spent 10 hours on thewitness stand. He was the last defense witness.   Under cross-examination on Friday, Bakker testified repeatedlythat he didn't remember details of his ministry's finances. Thetestimony prompted his attorney, George Davis, to say ``it was verydamaging, very devastating.''   During defense questioning Monday, Bakker summed up his case:``We were a church, and people always wanted to run it like abusiness. I had to keep telling them, this was a church, not abusiness.''</TEXT></DOC>
