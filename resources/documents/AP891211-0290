For two views of the future, TheAssociated Press solicited essays from Yutaka Kume, president ofNissan Motor Co. in Tokyo, and Donald Petersen, chairman of FordMotor Co. in Detroit. Below is Petersen's contribution.</TEXT><BYLINE>By DONALD E. PETERSEN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Chairman, Ford Motor Co.</BYLINE><BYLINE>For The Associated Press</BYLINE><TEXT>   There are many reasons to question whether America's economicand political dominance in world affairs will continue.   A major concern centers around the erosion that has occurred inAmerican manufacturing. If we look at individual segments, some arenow controlled completely by foreign competitors, and others arelosing their dominance.   Weakness in our industrial base hurts our national ability tocompete. As more and more industries decline, the manufacturersthat rely upon them lose a competitive advantage.   Japanese automakers, for example, enjoy the advantage of aleading edge not only in such industries as consumer electronicsand semiconductors, but also in machine tools, optics and manymore. These industries constantly furnish the Japanese autoindustry with new ideas and products. In America, we are slowlylosing the advantages of similar partnerships as more and moresectors of our industrial base weaken.   Does America have time to catch up? Yes, we do; but our workextends far beyond individual industries to larger problems in oursociety.   In education, statistics indicate we are losing ground. Students14 years old and older are dropping out of school at a rate of700,000 annually. Thirteen percent of all 17-year-olds who arestill in school are ``functionally illiterate.''   In capital investment, we are far behind the other majorindustrial economies in the percentage of gross national product weinvest in modernizing our factories and offices. In October, TheWall Street Journal described the capital spending boom that isunder way in Japan. Overall, Japanese capital spending this yearwill be more than $520 billion, 5 percent more than Americancompanies will spend. Yet, Japan's total output is less thantwo-thirds of ours.   Not all of this spending will go to build new capacity. TheJournal reported that 14 percent will be spent on new or improvedproducts; 17 percent will be used to cut costs; and 12 percent willbe for research and development.   Clearly, we have our work cut out for us if we hope to competein an environment such as this. In today's global market, no nationhas a long-term advantage in technology, managerial wisdom orcreativity. Expertise _ ``intellectual capital'' _ abounds all overthe globe.   America can compete in this environment _ if we choose to. Butto succeed, we must pay strict attention to certain time-provenfundamentals. Four are particularly critical: product quality,keeping the customer in sharp focus, cost control that does notsacrifice investment, and most important, rediscovering the valueof the employees who do the work and generate the ideas.   Can American leadership in world affairs continue? Certainly,but we must make significant long-term progress in two key areas.   Education is the first. The national crisis in primary andsecondary education must be resolved. But we cannot stop here. Moreof our brightest students must seek careers in science, mathematicsand engineering.   Second, we must strengthen our industrial base by manufacturingmore of our vital components. It is always easy to buy things fromsomeone else. But rebuilding our industrial base will requireinvestment in the necessary plants and technology. This is hardwork, and the payback often can be far down the road. Yet, we haveno choice if we want to succeed.   America is in a race that we cannot refuse to run. If we are tocross the finish line, it will take much time and a great deal ofhard work. Today's problems were a long time in the making, andthey will not be solved with short-term actions.   Yet, with resolve and commitment, the United States can continueto prosper and lead.</TEXT><TEXT>   Donald E.
