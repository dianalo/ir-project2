The induced lossrate has been calculated based on damage components which depend mainlyon neutron fluence and show little recovery. The authors also show fusionneutron irradiation effects on related optoelectronic devices and theirhardness levels. These are the neutron fluences at which important performanceparameters of the devices begin to degrade. These data are useful forfiber optics design of fusion diagnostic systems.</TEXT></DOC>
