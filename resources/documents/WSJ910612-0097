Conversion to decimal stock quotes could save money forinvestors when they buy and sell stocks. But it might alsotouch off a damaging price war among securities firms,securities executives say.</LP><TEXT>   SEC officials caution that the discussions about decimalstock quotes are only in the early stages, and that there isno certainty that the idea will move beyond staff studies toa formal proposal that would be voted on by SECcommissioners.   But in a sign of the SEC's interest, a commission stafferrecently asked the Securities Industry Automation Corp.,which runs the central quote system for U.S. stock exchanges,to study the cost of changing to decimal stock quotes,according to exchange officials.   For some 200 years, U.S. stocks prices have been quoted indollars and fractions, based on 1/8th of a dollar, or&quot;point,&quot; as the most common minimum. (Low-priced ordistressed stocks sometimes trade in 1/16s or 1/32s.)   Yesterday, for example, shares of International BusinessMachines Corp. closed at a 3/8th, or 37.5-cent, &quot;spread&quot;between the buying and selling price. Market makers werewilling to pay $102.125 for Big Blue, and sell the stock at$102.50.   SEC officials contend that moving to a system that quotesstock prices in dollars and cents would create efficiency inthe stock market that eighths and sometimes sixteenths can'tpermit.   &quot;When you have a system of eighths and sixteenths, youhave an artificial limit on how tight the spreads can be,&quot;says a senior SEC official. &quot;To the extent you can narrow it,it narrows the spreads.&quot;   The immediate benefits of such a system would fall toinvestors, the cornerstone around whom much of securities lawis built.   With decimal trading, an investor might be able topurchase IBM at $102.40, or $102.15, or, at the tightestspread, 102.13.   &quot;I think the {SEC} believes the lower the spreads, thetighter the market, and that's the best for the public,&quot; saidBernard L. Madoff, head of an off-exchange market-making firmin U.S. stocks that competes with traditional exchanges.   A spokesperson for the New York Stock Exchange said theexchange &quot;is aware of SEC thinking&quot; on decimal stock quotes.   Some securities executives think that a switch to decimalstock quotes is unavoidable. &quot;I think it is inevitable thatthe system goes to smaller fractions, and then even to&quot;decimals, said Peter Da Puzzo, cohead of world-wide equitytrading at Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. He said top marketregulation officials at the SEC have recently said: &quot;It'sdone in London; why can't it be done here?&quot;   Added one exchange official: &quot;It doesn't take 20-20 visionto see {decimals} coming. I think it is inevitable.&quot;   While the idea of switching U.S. stock markets to decimalquotes has floated around the SEC in the past, an agencyofficial contends that the idea appears to have resurfacedbecause the commission has a relatively new chairman, RichardBreeden, and a new market regulation director, WilliamHeyman. Proponents of the plan within the SEC may be lookingto find a new godfather for a decimal-based system.   Exchange officials said they received a new indication ofthe commission's interest last week when an SEC staff membermet with them in Cincinnati for a routine conference.   At that meeting, the staffer, Kathryn Natale, an assistantSEC director of market regulation, suggested that theSecurities Industry Automation Corp. explore the costs ofchanging its quote system to accommodate decimal trading. Ms.Natale couldn't be reached for comment.   Wall Street securities executives claim that a decimalsystem would make it more difficult to trade large blocks ofstock on U.S. exchanges. The 12.5-cent spread, they say, actslike a cushion, ensuring a minimum compensation to securitiesfirms for the risk and cost of trading. They argue that the&quot;depth,&quot; or size, of stock orders waiting to be traded in amarket is as important as the price.   Switching to decimals &quot;could seriously reduce spreads tothe point where&quot; brokers no longer would risk their own moneyto complete trades, says Michael Dritz, chief executive ofSmith New Court, Carl Marks, a London-based securities firm.   It would also make for fierce competition in the pricingof stocks, leaving little room for smaller securities firmsthat need a minimum 12.5-cent spread to survive as brokers.   However, proponents of decimal trading say current spreadsare actually a cost to investors. By cutting spreads, thecost of trading will fall, they argue, inviting much moretrading volume to exchanges.   Former SEC Commissioner Joseph Grundfest, now a professorat Stanford Law School in Palo Alto, Calif., argued in favorof decimal pricing during his tenure at the agency in thelate 1980s. &quot;The real spread for IBM might well be a nickel,not 12 1/2 cents, so why not quote it at a nickel?&quot; he asks.&quot;The eighth may well have been a reasonable number to use 20years ago, but in today's market, it's an anachronism.&quot;   He adds that for large trades, &quot;traders can make the pricecome out anywhere they want.&quot; For example, if aninstitutional investor wants to buy a million shares of FordMotor Co. at $37.68 each, the trader may handle some of theorder at 37 5/8 (or $37.625) and some at 37 3/4 ($37.75); byaveraging the two pieces of the order, the trading firm canset the price at tighter than a 1/8th spread.   Decimal trading could enhance a new regime of trading,already envisioned by some Wall Street executives, in whichinstitutions will trade directly with brokers in competitivemarkets on screens.   Exchange officials add that the SEC sees decimal quotes asa possible way to resolve the thorny problem of &quot;payment fororder flow.&quot; That's when a large market-maker pays a smallregional investment firm a penny or two a share to pass alongbuy and sell orders for stocks that the regional housedoesn't handle itself.   The bigger firm hopes to recoup the fee by doing a greatervolume of trades -- and making money off the spread, often onstocks in its inventory.   The SEC currently is studying the question of payment fororder flow to determine whether it hurts individual investorswho may not be getting the best execution on their stockorders as the orders are passed from firm to firm.   If the spread is narrowed to pennies, the argument goes,it would no longer be as profitable for larger firms to buyorders from regional firms.   However, Mr. Madoff, who pays brokerage firms a penny ashare for orders, says changing stock quotes into decimals&quot;is certainly not going to change anything regarding paymentfor order flow.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
