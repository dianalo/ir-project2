Important questions about the Regulations_answers various questionsraised during the development of these regulations. <ITAG tagnum="84">I. Background </ITAG>In November 1975, Congress enacted the Age Discrimination Act (42 U.S.C.6101, <T3>et seq.</T3>) as part of the amendments to the Older Americans Act(Pub. L. 94-135). The Act prohibits discriminating on the basis of agein all programs and activities receiving federal financial assistance.The Act prohibits recipients of federal financial assistance from takingactions that result in denying or limiting services or otherwise discriminationon basis of age. The Act also contains certain exceptions that permit,under limited circumstances, use of age distinctions or factors other thanage that may have a disproportionate effect on the basis of age.Like other civil rights statutes, the Act applies only to programs or activitiesin which there is an intermediary (recipient) standing between the federalfinancial assistance and the ultimate beneficiary of that assistance. TheAct does not apply to programs of direct assistance (such as the SocialSecurity program in which federal funds flow directly and unconditionallyfrom the federal government to the individual beneficiary of those funds.)Prior to the development of any regulations, the Act required the Commissionon Civil Rights to conduct a study of age discrimination in federally-fundedprograms and activities. The Commission transmitted its study to the Presidentand the Congress on January 10, 1978. The Commission published a secondpart of its study in January 1979. The Act also required each affectedfederal agency to respond to the Commission's findings and recommendations,and provided time for the Congress to consider amendments to the Act.After receipt of the report from the Commission on Civil Rights and thefederal agency responses to that report, the Congress considered amendmentsto the age Discrimination Act. In October 1978, Congress amended the Act(Pub. L. 95-478). The amendments: (1) Added a private right of action tothe Age Discrimination Act; (2) provided a mechanism for the disbursalto alternate recipients of funds that have been withheld under the AgeDiscrimination Act; (3) added a requirement that the Department of Health,Education and Welfare (HEW) (now the Department of Health and Human Services,HHS) approve the final regulations of other federal agencies; (4) madethe effective date of regulations implementing the Act no earlier thanJuly 1, 1979; (5) required annual reports to the Congress on progress toimplementing the Act; and (6) removed the word ``unreasonable'' from theAct's statement of purpose. The 1978 amendments left intact the exceptionsto the general prohibition against age discrimination contained in the1975 Act. The amended Act continues to apply to persons of all ages.The Act requires HHS to issue proposed and subsequent final general regulationssetting standards to be followed by all federal departments and agenciesin implementing the Act. HEW issued proposed general regulations on December1, 1978 and final general regulations on June 12, 1979. Those general regulationsand the prohibition against age discrimination became effective on July1, 1979.The Act requires each department or agency which operates programs of federalfinancial assistance to issue proposed and final regulations consistentwith the general regulations. The Secretary of HHS must approve all agencyand department regulations.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Regulatory Procedures</ITAG>Impact Analysis-Executive Order 12291Executive Order 12291 requires that a regulatory impact analysis be preparedfor major rules. A major rule is defined in the Order as any rule thathas an annual effect on the national economy of $100 million or more_orcertain other specified effects. FEMA concludes that the regulations implementingthe Age Discrimination Act are not a major rule within the meaning of theExecutive Order because they do not have an effect on the economy of $100million or more, or otherwise meet the threshold criteria.<T3>Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 </T3>The Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. Ch. 6) requires the federal governmentto anticipate and reduce the impact of rules and paperwork requirementson small businesses. For each rule with a ``significant economic impacton a substantial number of these small entities,'' an analysis must beprepared describing the rule's impact on these small entities. ``Smallentities'' are defined by the Act to include small businesses, small nonprofitorganizations, and small governmental entities. Based on the cost analysisof the age regulations, FEMA finds that the effect of the age regulationson small entities is minimal. Therefore, a regulatory flexibility analysisis not required. <T3>Paperwork Reduction Act and Recordkeeping and Reporting Requirements</T3>The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has approved the informationcollection requirements contained in this proposed rule under provisionsof the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, 44 U.S.C. 3501<T3> et seq.</T3> and has assigned OMB control number 3067-0177. <ITAG tagnum="84">III. Overview of the Regulations </ITAG>The following paragraphs summarize the text of the proposed FEMA age discriminationregulations and explain any changes that have been made as a result ofthe public participation process. The final regulations are divided into4 subparts:<ITAG tagnum="81">Subpart A_General </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="81">Subpart B_Standards for Determining Age Discrimination </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="81">Subpart C_Duties of FEMA Recipients </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="81">Subpart D_Investigation, Conciliation and Enforcement Procedures </ITAG><T3>Subpart A_General </T3>Subpart A explains the purpose of the FEMA age discrimination regulations,which is to set out the Agency's policies and procedures under the Actand the general regulations. (andSection; 7.910) These regulations applyto each FEMA recipient and to all programs or activities receiving financialassistance from FEMA. (andSection; 7.911) Although the Act generally covers all programs and activities that receivefederal financial assistance, it does not apply to any age distinction``established under authority of ``any law'' which provides benefits orestablishes criteria for participation on the basis of age or in age relatedterms. Thus, age distinctions that are ``established under authority ofany law'' continue in use. These regulations adopt without change the definitionof ``any law'' established in the general regulations. Therefore, theseregulations do not apply to age distinctions contained in federal statutes,state statutes or local statutes or ordinances adopted by elected, generalpurpose legislative bodies. (andSection; 7.911) The Act also excludes from its coverage most employment practices. However,the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA), administered by the EqualEmployment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), continues to be the federal statutethat prohibits employment discrimination against most persons of the ageof 40 or older. Subpart A also defines terms used in these regulations.(andSection; 7.912)<T3>Subpart B_Standards for Determining Age Discrimination </T3>Subpart B of these regulations incorporates the basic standards for determiningwhat constitutes age discrimination that are set out in the general regulations.The regulations state that no person in the United States shall, on thebasis of age, be denied the benefits of, be excluded from participationin, or be subject to discrimination under, any program or activity receivingfederal financial assistance. (andSection; 7.920) The specific prohibited actions are patterned after the regulations issuedunder Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (44 CFR Part 7). As a generalrule, separate or different treatment which denies or limits service from,or participation in, a program receiving federal funds is prohibited bythese regulations. The Act does include some exceptions to the general rule against age discrimination.The regulations provide definitions for two terms that are essential toan understanding of these exceptions: ``normal operation'' and ``statutoryobjective.''' (andSection; 7.921) The regulations adopt the four-part test established in the general regulationsto determine when an explicit age distinction is necessary to the normaloperation of a program or to the achievement of a statutory objective ofa program. The test (see andSection; 87.922 of the regulations) requiresthat: The age distinction be used as a measure of another characteristic(s);the other characteristic(s) must be measured in order for the program tocontinue to operate normally or to meet a statutory objective; the othercharacteristic(s) can reasonably be measured by age; and the other characteristic(s)is impractical to measure directly on an individual basis. All parts of the test must be met for an explicit age distinction to satisfyone of these exceptions and to continue in use in a federally-assistedprogram. This four-part test will be used to scrutinize age distinctionsthat are imposed by recipients in the administration of federally-assistedprograms, when the recipient alleges the distinction is necessary to thenormal operation or the achievement of a statutory objective of a programand when the age distinction is not specifically authorized by a federal,state or local statute. Recipients of federal funds are also permitted to take an action otherwiseprohibited by the Act, if the action is based on<T3> ``reasonable factors other than age.''</T3> In that event, the actionmay be taken even though it has a disproportionate effect on persons ofdifferent ages. The regulations require, however, that the factor beara direct and substantial relationship to the program's normal operationor statutory objective. (andSection; 7.923) These regulations place on the recipient of FEMA funds the burden of provingthat an age distinction or other action falls within the exceptions discussedabove. (andSection; 7.924) There are three other instances in which FEMA recipient may use age distinctionsthat would otherwise be prohibited by the Act and these regulations: (1)A recipient may take voluntary affirmative action to overcome the effectsof conditions that have resulted in limited participation in the recipient'sprogram on the basis of age (andSection; 7.926); (2) a recipient may givespecial benefits to the elderly or to children (andSection; 7.926); and (3)a recipient may comply with distinctions contained in FEMA regulations.(andSection; 7.927)Subpart C_Duties of FEMA RecipientsSubpart C explains the duties of FEMA recipients which are establishedby the general regulations.FEMA recipients have primary responsibility to ensure that their programsand activities are in compliance with the Act, the general regulationsand these regulations.Where a FEMA recipient passes on financial assistance to sub-recipients,the recipient must notify sub-recipients of their obligations under theAct and its regulations. FEMA recipients must also inform beneficiariesabout the protection provided by the Act and its regulations. (andSection;7.931)Each recipient of federal financial assistance must sign an assurance thatit will comply with the Act and its regulations. (andSection; 7.932)FEMA may require recipients employing the equivalent of 15 or more full-timeemployees to examine their use of age distinctions under the Act as partof a compliance review or a complaint investigation conducted by the Agency.(andSection; 7.932)Each FEMA recipient must keep records and make available to FEMA upon requestinformation that FEMA determines is necessary to establish whether therecipient is in compliance with the Act and its regulations. Recipientsmust also allow FEMA reasonable access to books and records to the extentFEMA finds necessary to determine compliance with the Act and its regulations.(andSection; 7.933)Subpart D_Investigation, Conciliation, and Enforcement ProceduresSubpart D of these regulations establishes the procedures FEMA will usein its investigation, conciliation and enforcement activities. These proceduresare closely tied to requirements in the general regulations, primarilyin Subpart D. Additional information on the filing of complaints and onmediation is provided in section IV of this preamble.FEMA may conduct compliance or pre-award reviews or use other similar proceduresto ensure compliance with the Act and its regulations. These proceduresmay be used even in the absence of a complaint against a recipient. Thereviews may be as comprehensive as necessary to determine whether a violationhas occurred. (andSection; 7.940)Complaints of age discrimination may be filed with FEMA by an individualor a class or by a third party. The complaint must allege discriminationoccurring on or after July 1, 1979. The complaint must be filed within180 days from the date the complainant first knew of the alleged act ofdiscrimination, although FEMA may extend this time limit for good cause.The filing date for a complaint will be the date upon which the complaintis sufficient to be processed. A complaint is deemed ``sufficient'' whenit contains particulars (e.g., names, addresses, and telephone numbersof parties involved; date(s) of alleged discrimination; kind(s) of allegeddiscrimination) upon which to begin an investigation. A complaint mustidentify the parties involved and the date the complainant first had knowledgeof the alleged violation, describe generally the practice complained of,and be signed by the complainant. FEMA will notify the recipient and thecomplainant of their rights and obligations under the complaint procedure,including the right to have a representative at all stages of the process.FEMA will permit a complainant to add information to a complaint when necessaryto meet the requirements of sufficient complaint. FEMA will return to thecomplainant any complaint that does not fall within the jurisdiction ofthe Act and will explain the reason(s) why the complaint is outside thejurisdiction of the Act. (andSection; 7.941)FEMA will refer to mediation all sufficient complaints that fall withinthe coverage of the Act. On June 12, 1979, the Secretary of HEW designatedthe Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service (FMCS) to manage the mediationprocess which was established by the general regulations for all ADA complaints.Complainants and recipients are required to participate in the effort toreach a mutually satisfactorily mediated settlement of the complaint, althoughthey need not meet with the mediator at the same time. Generally, mediationmay last no more than 60 days from the date a complaint is filed with FEMA.The mediator will have the authority to terminate the mediation at anytime before the end of the 60 day period if the process appears to havebroken down. The mediator also has the authority to extend the 60 day mediationperiod where settlement is likely. A settlement based on terms satisfactoryto both parties will be put in writing and sent to FEMA. FEMA will takeno further action on a complaint that has been successfully mediated. Themediator will protect the confidentiality of all information obtained inthe course of mediation. (andSection; 7.942)FEMA will investigate complaints that are unresolved after mediation orare re-opened because the mediation agreement is violated. FEMA will firstattempt to resolve the complaint through informal fact-finding. An agreementreached during information investigation will be signed by both partiesand by a FEMA official. The agreement will not affect any other enforcementby FEMA. The settlement is not a finding of discrimination against a recipient.If these informal efforts do not succeed, FEMA will develop formal findingsthrough further investigation of the complaint. (andSection; 7.943) A recipient may not intimidate or retaliate against any person who attemptsto exercise a right protected by the Act or who participates in any aspectof the proceedings used to resolve allegations of age discrimination. (andSection;7.944) The procedures for securing compliance with the Act and these regulationsare taken from the general regulations. The procedures include terminationof federal funds after an opportunity for a hearing on the record, referralto the Department of Justice, or the use of the services of any federal,state or local government agency to correct a violation. These regulationsinclude a provision for the deferral of new federal financial assistancefrom FEMA when termination proceeding are initiated. (andSection; 7.945)FEMA will use the procedural provisions contained in the regulations implementingTitle VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to enforce the FEMA age discriminationregulations. These provisions are at 40 CFR 7.151<T3> et seq.</T3> (andSection; 7.946) When FEMA withholds funds from a recipient (according to the provisionsof andSection; 7.945), the Director may disburse those funds to an alternaterecipient, except in the case of funds allocated pursuant to a Presidentialdeclaration of disaster or emergency. The alternate recipient must demonstratethe ability to comply with these regulations and to achieve the goals ofthe federal statute which authorized the financial assistance. (andSection;7.948) Complainants may file civil actions as provided by law when administrativeremedies are exhausted. Administrative remedies are exhausted if either180 days have elapsed since the complainant filed the complaint and FEMAhas made no finding, or if FEMA issues a finding in favor of the recipient.The complainant may then file a suit in a U.S. District Court where therecipient is located or transacts business. The complainant must indicateat the time the suit is filed if the attorney's fees will be demanded inthe event that the complainant is successful. No action can be broughtif the same alleged violation by the same recipients is the subject ofa pending action in any U.S. court. Complainants who wish to file an actionmust provide 30 days notice to the Attorney General, the Director, andthe recipient. (andSection; 7.949)<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Important Questions About the Regulations</ITAG>This section of the preamble answers various important questions aboutthese regulations.1. What Age Does the Act Cover?Section 303 of the Act prohibits discrimination on the basis of age infederally-assisted programs or activities. Although the legislative historyindicates Congressional concern for the problems of the elderly in particular,the Congress made it clear in its conference committee report that theAct is intended to apply to persons of all ages. Nowhere in the amendmentprocess was there any discussion of limiting or changing the coverage ofthe Act. It continues to extend protection to persons of all ages.Various advocacy groups for older persons originally suggested that HHSconstrue the general regulations to protect only the elderly or to providegreater protection for older persons than for other age groups. This constructionis not legally supportable in view of the legislative history and the plainlanguage of the Act. Thus, all regulations issued to implement the Actprovide protection to persons of all ages.2. When is the Prohibition Against Age Discrimination Effective?The Act provides that its prohibition of age discrimination becomes effectiveupon the issuance of regulations. Section 304 provides for the issuanceof age disrimination regulations in two phases:(a) HHS publishes general, government-wide regulations to implement theprohibition against age discrimination in federally-assisted programs;and (b) Each federal agency then publishes regulations specific to its programsand consistent with the general regulations.The Act's prohibition of age discrimination became effective when the firstset of regulations, the general regulations, became effect on July 1, 1979.The general regulations established standards for determining age discriminationand procedures for enforcing the Act. All federal agencies must adopt thosestandards in their agency_specific regulations.3. Where Can Complaints of Age Discrimination Be Filed with FEMA?Complaints involving FEMA recipients and beneficiaries should be sent to:Federal Emergency Management Agency, Office of Personnel and Equal Opportunity,500 C Street SW., Washington, DC 20472. Any complaint must allege age discrimination occurring after the date offinal adoption of this rule. The complaint should: (a) Identify the partiesinvolved; (b) give the date of the alleged violation or when the complainantfirst knew of the alleged violation; (c) generally describe what happend;and (d) be signed by the complainant.FEMA screens all complaints and refers those that describe actions coveredby the Act and contain the necessary information to the FMCS for mediation.The Act states that a complainant may file a civil action 180 days fromthe date the complaint was filed with the federal agency if the agencyhas taken no action, or upon the date the agency makes a determinationin favor of the recipient, whichever comes first. For purposes of exhaustionof administrative remedies within FEMA, the 180 day period will run fromthe date the complaint is filed with FEMA. In cases where FEMA has nottaken final action on a complaint and 180 days elapse, the complainantretains the option of filing a civil action, or having FEMA continue topursue the complaint through the administrative process. FEMA retains theoption of continuing its enforcement activities even after a suit is filed.4. What are the Rules Against Age Discrimination? These regulations adopt without change the provisions against age discriminationfrom the general regulations. The general regulations provide that, exceptas provided in the Act and its regulations, ``* * * No person in the UnitedStates shall, on the basis of age, be excluded from participation in, bedenied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under, any programor activity receiving Federal financial assistance.'' It means that unlesspermitted by one of the exceptions, recipients of FEMA assistance may not,either directly or indirectly, do anything to exclude persons from theirprograms or activities on the basis of age. Nor may recipients do anythingthat is not permitted by one of the exceptions to deny or limit personson the basis of their age in their efforts to participate in FEMA-assistedprograms or activities. The prohibition against age discrimination does not include an absoluteprohibition against separate treatment on the basis of age. As a generalrule, separate or different treatment which denies or limits services from,or participation in, a program receiving financial assistance from FEMAwould be prohibited by these regulations. Separate or different treatmentwhich does no deny or limit services is permitted. Separate or differenttreatment may be necessary to normal operation or to the achievement ofa statutory objective by the recipient and may qualify as an exceptionunder these regulations. 5. What is the Meaning of the Exception of Age Distinction ``EstablishedUnder Authority of Any Law?The Age Discrimination Act applies to all programs and activities thatreceive federal financial assistance. However, the Act does not apply toage distinctions ``established under authority of any law'' that providebenefits or establish criteria for participation on the basis of age orin age related terms. Age distinctions that qualify under this exceptiondo not require further scrutiny under these regulations.The regulations define the term ``any law'' to mean a federal, state orlocal statute or ordinance adopted by an elected, general purpose legislativebody. This provision does <T3>not </T3>provide an automatic exemption for age distinctions that arecontained in regulations or in ordinances enacted by bodies which are notelected or are special-purpose even though elected, such as state or localschool boards.The exemption for age distinctions ``established under authority of anylaw'' applies to both explicit uses of age (e.g., a statute that definesan adult to be a person over age 18) and the use of age-related terms (e.g.,statutes that refer only to ``adults'' or ``children'' or ``youths'' withoutdefining those terms explicitly). When a statute (federal, state or local)uses, but does not define, an age-related term, FEMA will accept reasonabledefinitions of those terms in regulations without further scrutiny. Thus,for example, FEMA would not ordinarily question a definition of ``child''as a person up to age 18, but would seek further justification of the regulationswhich define ``child'' as a person up to age 30.<T3>6. When is an Age Distinction Necessary to the Normal Operation orto the Achievement of a Statutory Objective of a Program or Activity?</T3>These regulations incorporated from the general regulations the four-parttest for determining when an explicit age distinction is necessary to thenormal operation of a program or activity, or to the achievement of a statutoryobjection. FEMA will use this four-part test to scrutinize age distinctionsimposed in the administration of federally-assisted programs, but whichare not explicitly authorized by a federal, state or local statute or ordinanceadopted by an elected, general-purpose legislative body. If the age distinctionin question fails any part of the four-part test, the recipient of FEMAfunds may not continue to use that age distinction.The four-part test is designed to require careful scrutiny of age distinctionsin programs receiving federal financial assistance and to weed out agedistinctions that are neither directly related to an essential characteristicor a program not based on explicitly stated objectives of a law. It isnot intended to serve as a basis for permitting continued use of age distinctionsfor the sake of administrative convenience, if this results in denial orlimitation of services on the basis of age.FEMA encourages its recipients to apply to every age distinction flexibility;that is, to permit a person who demonstrates eligibility to participatein the activity or program even though he or she would otherwise be barredby age distinction. Other things being equal, a distinction under reviewis more likely to qualify under any of the exceptions if it does not automaticallybar all those who do not meet the age requirements.<T3>7. When is the Use of a Factor Other than Age Exempted from the Coverageof These Regulations?</T3>The Age Discrimination Act permits a recipient of federal funds to examineits use of factors other than age which have a disproportionate effecton the basis of age in light of the individual facts and circumstancessurrounding their use. This examination will determine whether use of afactor other than age is sufficiently related to achieving a legitimateprogram purpose and, therefore, justifies limiting or denying servicesor participation to persons disproportionately excluded because of age.<T3>8. What are ``Special Benefits'' for the Elderly or Children?</T3>These regulations incorporate the provision of the general regualtionspermitting a recipient of a program to provide special benefits to childrenor the elderly.The special benefits provision resulted from FEMA's encouragement of providingspecial benefits to children or the elderly. These special benefits oftentake the form of special discounts or reduced fees for the elderly in afederally-funded program.In reviewing such special benefits in specific cases to insure that theyare in fact consistent with the Act and Congressional intent, FEMA willconsider the rationale for the special benefit, the effect on other individuals,and all other relevant factors.The regulations leave to the reasonable discretion of the recipient thedefinition as to who qualifies as ``children'' or ``the elderly'' for purposesof receiving a special benefit.<T3>9. What is the Effect of Age Distinctions Contained in FEMA Regulations?</T3>Section 7.927 makes explicit what is implicit in andSection; 90.32 of thegovernment-wide regulation. Section 90.32 of the government-wide regulationestablished the mechanism for determining that age distinctions imposedby government agencies are consistent with the Age Discrimination Act andimplementing regulations. Under this section, agencies must within 12 monthsreview age distinctions imposed on recipients by regulations, policiesand administrative practices. Each agency must then publish, for publiccomment, in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>a comprehensive accounting of all such age distinctions,listing those to be continued, the justifications for their continuance,those to be adopted by regulations, and those to be eliminated. After this12-month period, agencies may not continue any age distinction that hasnot already been adopted by regulation or is adopted by regulation underthe Administrative Procedure Act using the notice and comment proceduresspecified in 5 U.S.C. 553. In addition, beginning with the effective dateof an agency's final regulation, an agency may not impose a new age distinctionunless it is adopted by regulation under the Administrative Procedure Actusing these notice and comment procedures.This comprehensive mechanism for carefully scrutinizing age distinctionsimposed by federal agencies on recipients to insure their consistency withthe Age Discrimination Act and implementing regulations is based upon publicparticipation and the rule making process of the Administrative ProcedureAct, through which the appropriateness and validity of any age distinctioncan be thoroughly evaluated. Implicit in this far-reaching mechanism isthat age distinction contained in regulations adopted under the AdministrativeProcedure Act are entitled to a very strong presumption of permissibility.Section 7.927 makes this explicit by providing that any age distinctionscontained in a rule or regulation issued by FEMA will be presumed to bewithin the statutory exemption applicable to actions necessary to the achievementof a statutory objective of the program to which the rule or regulationapplies. This does not mean that such age distinctions are immune fromadditional scrutiny to insure their consistency with the Age DiscriminationAct and implementing regulations, but that such further scrutiny will beunder the general standards of the Act, rather than under the process establishedfor previously unreviewed age distinctions, in which the recipient hasthe burden of proving tht the detailed standards contained in andSection;7.922 of the regulation have been met. Since the review process of rulemaking proceeding subjected the age distinctions to scrutiny on all possiblebases, it is appropriate that any subsequent review be limited to determiningviolation of fundamental statutory requirements. This provision thus reaffirmsthat recipient upon whom age distinctions are imposed by FEMA regulationsadopted pursuant to statutory authority and under the Administrative ProcedureAct, as well as the public, can be assured that such age distinctions havebeen carefully considered and are believed by FEMA to be possible underthe Age Discrimination Act and implementing regulations.10. Do the Regulations Require Proportional Allocation of Services andFunds by Age?Some believe that certain age groups, especially the elderly, do not gettheir ``fair share'' of funds or program slots in certain federally-fundedprograms. These persons argue that the serious under-representation ofcertain age groups in the allocation of program funds or services <T3>is </T3>age discrimination and should be prohibited by these regulations.These regulations do <T3>not </T3>require proportional program participation by age or the proportionalallocation of funds by age. However, disproportionate allocation of fundsor program participation may be one element that triggers an examinationof whether age discrimination exists in the federally-funded program oractivity. If further inquiry is necessary, the recipient may show thatthe disparity in rate of participation, fund allocation, or services hasnondiscriminatory causes.11. How do these Regulations Require Mediation of Complaints?FEMA supports mediation as an important innovation in the resolution ofage discrimination complaints. The mediation process represents an effortto provide faster and more creative resolution of complaints through informalmethods of dispute resolution. While mediation does represent a new stepin the complaint resolution process, the experience in resolving complaintsunder other civil rights statutes indicates that the 60 days allowed formediation will not significantly delay the enforcement process.Mediation is being used with increasing success to resolve disputes betweenparties outside the traditional area of labor management negotiations.The most important feature of the mediation process is that it will beunder the supervision of an impartial third party, a mediator assignedby the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service (FMCS). FMCS was designatedby the Secretary of HEW to mediate age discrimination complaints for allfederal departments and agencies which distribute federal financial assistance.The mediator is in no way connected with HHS or the funding agency in theage discrimination dispute. Instead, mediators have been recruited andselected by the FMCS. Each mediator is assigned to the dispute by the FMCSwithout consultation with the FEMA.The mediators have been specially trained in procedures for resolving disputesand in the requirements of the Age Discrimination Act and its implementingregulations. The mediator will contact the two parties and explain theprocedures to both the complainant and the recipient. Mediation does notnecessarily mean that the two parties to the dispute must meet face-to-face;each may meet separately or otherwise discuss the matter with the mediator.Since the mediated settlement must be satisfactory to both parties, neitherthe complainant nor the recipient is compelled to settle the complaint.A complainant who believes that he or she is not receiving full satisfactionin the mediation process need not agree to a settlement of the dispute.A complainant will have to wait no more than 60 days for the complaintto be returned to FEMA for its investigation to begin. This 60 day period will count as part of the 180 days which FEMA has toresolve the complaint before a court action can be filed by the complainant.The 60 day period may be extended by the mediator, with the concurrenceof FEMA, for not more than 30 days if the mediator determines that agreementwill likely be reached during the extended period. The mediation process has been designed to minimize expenses to the parties.The mediator can travel to the location of the parties and the servicesof the mediator will be paid for by the federal government. The mediationitself is conducted in an informal atmosphere in which both sides attemptto resolve the dispute in a mutually satisfactory manner. This should encouragethe parties to discuss their dispute without resoring to efforts to builda formal legal case.
