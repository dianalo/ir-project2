Small its next president and chiefoperating officer, succeeding Roger Birk, 60 years old, whois to retire Jan. 31.   Mr. Small's move brings to a close a 27-year career at theNew York-based banking concern that brought him within onestep of the bank's presidency.</LP><TEXT>   Fannie Mae also said Franklin D. Raines, general partnerat Lazard Freres andamp; Co., will take over as vice chairman Sept.18. Before joining Lazard Freres, Mr. Raines, 42, worked inWashington as an official with the Office of Management andBudget and as assistant director of the White House domesticpolicy staff.   Mr. Small, 49, an ambitious executive, at one time hadbeen considered a leading contender for Citicorp's No. 2slot. But in a January 1990 reorganization, the long-vacantpresidency was awarded to Richard S. Braddock, head ofCiticorp's highly successful consumer banking operation.   Mr. Small assumed the role of vice chairman, where heacted as liaison with the bank's largest 300 to 400 corporatecustomers world-wide. He no longer had the authority toapprove loans and no longer had a large staff reporting tohim. Mr. Small's total compensation in 1990, however,remained roughly what it was the previous year. At $825,826,he was paid the same as Mr. Braddock, according to thecompany's latest proxy statement.   &quot;The handwriting for this departure was on the wall onceBraddock was named president,&quot; said James McDermott,president of Keefe, Bruyette andamp; Woods, a bank research firm.&quot;The whole place is driven by the consumer bank and thesuccesses it has produced.&quot;   After Fannie Mae announced Mr. Small's new post, Citicorpsaid he had resigned from the board of Citicorp and aschairman of the executive committee.   Mr. Small, who from 1984 through 1989 had served as thebank executive in charge of institutional banking, wasresponsible for commercial lending worldwide. Like many ofits competitors, Citicorp incurred losses from the commercialreal-estate collapse of the late 1980s.   Mr. Small, according to one former Citicorp executive,played a major role in loans to Canadian financier RobertCampeau for his ill-fated purchase of Allied Stores andFederated Department Stores. Mr. Small personally approvedand pushed through Citicorp's April 1989 refinancing of $200million in working capital for struggling Allied, earningabout $6 million in up-front fees for Citicorp, the formerexecutive said.   By early July, it was clear that the company couldn't meetpayments, the executive said, and by mid-January 1990, Alliedslipped into bankruptcy-law proceedings. Citicorp is now owedalmost $300 million by Allied and Federated. The loans aren'tpaying interest. Some Allied senior bank debt, for example,is trading in the secondary loan market at about 45 cents onthe dollar.   Mr. Small denied he had been overly aggressive in makingthe Allied loan, adding &quot;I'm not aware that any money waslost on the deal.&quot;   Nonetheless, without referring to Mr. Small, John Reed,Citicorp chairman, said in a Harvard Business Review articlelast fall: &quot;It was not our best moment when we financedCampeau. We're not going to lose money; we're well secured.But I would suggest that if your custromer goes bankruptwithin one year of a deal, then the deal was not goodbusiness for you.&quot;   The departing Mr. Birk, former chairman and chiefexecutive officer of Merrill Lynch andamp; Co., came out ofsemi-retirement in 1987 after being recruited by then FannieMae Chairman David Maxwell to fill the presidency slot, whichhad turned over four times in as many years. Mr. Birk waslong expected to retire in January, when his contract runsout.   Mr. Small's experience in commercial banking could serveFannie Mae well, said some analysts, especially since banksare heavy mortgage lenders.   &quot;In terms of getting a commercial banker into the fold,that's going to be a key constituency for Fannie Mae goingforward,&quot; said Bruce Harting, who follows Fannie Mae forSalomon Brothers Inc. The troubles of the thrift industryhave lifted mortgage lending by banks to 40% of alloriginations.   Asked about his new job, Mr. Small said, &quot;I have a lot tolearn.&quot; But he added that he had been involved insecuritization of deals at Citicorp. That experience couldserve him well at Fannie Mae, which purchases home mortgagesand securitizes them for sale in the secondary market.   In the first quarter, Fannie Mae profit rose 16% to $320million, or $1.19 a share, from a year earlier. It was thecompany's 13th consecutive quarter of earnings growth. In NewYork Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Fannie Maeclosed at $49.625 a share, up 25 cents.</TEXT></DOC>
