I don't think that's the kind of message that needs toget out in this country,'' Guardian Angels leader Curtis Sliwa saidSunday.   The self-styled crime fighters, who picketed actor Sean Penn'shome in Malibu on Saturday, set up symbolic coffins outsideHopper's Venice home and chanted ``Kids will die with pain; DennisHopper in the hall of shame.''   The movie, which stars Penn and Robert Duvall as policeofficers, is a drama set amid the gang wars of Los Angeles. Hopperwrote and directed ``Colors.''   Police reported no problems during the weekend demonstration,which also included protesters lying on the ground to simulate amurder scene.   The Guardian Angels want Orion Pictures to either haltdistribution of the film or use some of its profits to supportcommunity organizations that combat gang violence, said Sliwa.   It wasn't known if Hopper was home during the protest. Sliwasaid some people were seen entering the house.   Neither Hopper, nor Orion officials could be reached for commentSunday about the protest by telephone. Hopper has said previouslyhe was surprised by objections to the movie.   Gangs were blamed for nearly 400 killings last year in LosAngeles County, and were the target of two unprecedented citywidepolice sweeps this weekend.</TEXT></DOC>
