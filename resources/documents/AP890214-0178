A few young Afghan soldiers, outside the airport gates, watchedthe Soviet soldiers board the planes in gray dress uniforms and furhats.   Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Vadim Perfilev told a newsbriefing in Moscow that Moslem guerrillas were massing outside majorcities _ including about 30,000 around Kabul _ but he did not saywhether they were preparing to attack.   ``The hardliners in the opposition _ despite their threat tooccupy Kabul and other major cities _ would not seem confident intheir success,'' said Perfilev. ``Therefore (the opposition) laysthe stress on economics and propaganda to provoke discontent of thelocal population.''   The guerrillas, who began fighting after a communist coup in1978, have surrounded and blockaded cold, hungry Kabul for months.   They fired five rockets into the capital on Tuesday, the daybefore the deadline for Soviet withdrawal. One killed four childrenand an old man lined up in the snow for bread, the state radioreported.   Two landed at the airport in the first such attack on thefacility for more than a month. They struck near a runway but Sovietsoldiers still at the airport said no one was injured.   Poland closed its Kabul embassy Tuesday and evacuated the fewremaining diplomats, as Hungary had done last week.   Western nations, including the United States, closed theirlegations earlier. The Soviets are keeping their embassy open butthe staff has been reduced from more than 300 to about 100.   A council called by guerrilla leaders to choose an interim Moslemgovernment for Afghanistan convened Friday in Pakistan, butdeteriorated into arguments between moderates and fundamentalists,including how to divide representation between the Sunni Moslemmajority and Shiite minority.   Insurgents claim the government of President Najib will fall soonafter the Soviets are gone. The interim government would arrangeelections and adminster the country until they were held.   Soviet soldiers entered Afghanistan in December 1979 and anestimated 115,000 were in the country when the withdrawal began May15, 1988, under a U.N.-mediated agreement. Wednesday is the deadlinefor all to be gone.   Perfilev said the Soviet pullout was exactly on schedule and thelast Soviet soldier would be out of Afghan territory by the deadline.   ``As of Feb. 15, not a single Soviet soldiers will be on Afghanterritory,'' Perfilev said.   The last Red Army troops to leave Kabul had been stationed at theairport, protecting an emergency Soviet airlift of food and fuelthat began last month. Soviet officers have said it would bring in12,000 tons of food in the first half of February before stoppingbecause of the withdrawal.   After manning their posts part of the day Tuesday, the Red Armytroopers changed from filthy green duty uniforms to dress grays andfiled into four huge Ilyushin 76 transports. About 80 men were seenboarding.   Lt. Col. Pyotr Sardarchuk, commander of the airport detail, wasasked the exact number in the group and said only ``all those whoare left.'' He shook the hands of the journalists watching and said``Goodbye.''   Soviet diplomats said several thousand other soldiers wereapproaching the Soviet border from elsewhere in Afghanistan.   Since the second stage of the withdrawal began in January, morethan 45,000 soldiers have left, the official Soviet news agency Tasssaid. The last contingent of troops, led by Lt. Gen. Boris Gromov,was expected to cross the bridge linking the town of Khairaton withthe city of Termez in the Soviet Union just before noon WednesdayMoscow time (4 a.m. EST), according to the Soviet newspaper Trud.   ``Tomorrow, you will see departing one of the last columns of ourmilitary contingent under the command of Hero of the Soviet UnionLt. Gen. B. Gromov,'' Trud said.   A formal departure ceremony was held Monday, when 15 paratroopersflew home. Another 450 soldiers left Kabul quietly Sunday, in aconvoy that set out on the Salang Highway during a heavy snowstorm.   The other 20,000 troops once based in and around the city startedleaving early in January, either by air or by road up the Salang,the only route from Kabul to the Soviet border 260 miles away. Thehighway winds through the rugged Hindu Kush mountains, where theguerrillas hide.   Kabul's markets were crowded Tuesday and, except for the rockets,the city appeared peaceful.   Residents said, however, that unsigned letters delivered the pastfew nights warned people to stay off the streets and away from theairport beginning Wednesday. Many said they believed the letterswere from guerrilla forces outside the city.   Some foreign diplomats suggested the letters might be the work ofKhadd, the Najib government's secret police.   A U.N. airlift of food to Kabul has been suspended becauseairlines that provided chartered planes fear for the safety of theircrews and aircraft.   Guerrilla attacks and heavy snow have interrupted the arrival offood, fuel and other supplies by road. Long lines form every day atbread stores and gasoline stations in a city swollen by refugees toa population of 2 million, twice its normal size.   On Monday, a column of Afghan trucks loaded with Soviet-suppliedfood and fuel reached Kabul from the north, and delivered wheat,rice, kerosene and gasoline to the capital, Tass said.</TEXT></DOC>
