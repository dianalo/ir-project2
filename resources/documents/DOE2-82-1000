<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-82-1000 </DOCNO><TEXT>Using the 16-detector /sup 133/Xe-NaCl-technique (Novo Cerebrograph) quantitativemeasurements of regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) were performed in14 patients with unilateral carotis obstruction before and during stimulationwith 3% CO/sub 2/ inhalation. In all patients resting studies did notshow any significant differences in hemispheric perfusion. In 11 patientsthe hemispheric blood flow increased significantly (by more than 6%)during CO/sub 2/ inhalation on the side without carotis obstruction.The following results were found after 3% CO/sub 2/-stimulation overthe hemisphere with the obstructed carotid artery: 1) rCBF increasedsignificantly on both sides (n=6) indicating the sufficiency of cerebralcollateral circulation; 2) a side-to-side significant difference (n=4)with the lower perfusion on the pathological side, indicating a decreasedor suspended reserve capacity; and 3) bilateral loss of cerebrovascularreactivity (n=4) as indicator of insufficieny of cerebral collateralcirculation. Asymmetry in rCBF or missing cerebrovascular reserve areindications for surgical treatment of the carotis obstruction.</TEXT></DOC>
