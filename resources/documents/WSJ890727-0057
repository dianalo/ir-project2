Current restrictions on oil exploration in U.S. waters would be significantly expanded in the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1, and the measure includes precedent-setting language seeking to lift injunctions on timber harvests in the Pacific Northwest.    Final passage came last night on a simple voice vote, but only after daylong debate in which both oil and lumber interests suffered setbacks at the hands of environmental forces in the Democrat-controlled chamber. By a 72-27 margin, senators rejected an industry-backed amendment seeking to undermine the moratoriums on oil exploration, and timber allies failed on a 52-47 roll call to head off a $65 million cut from funding for new forest roads.    The Senate action came as the House Appropriations Committee approved a $27 billion transportation bill for fiscal 1990, and moved to interject itself in a renewed fight over military base closings. Congress authorized the Pentagon in April to begin shutting down all or part of 91 military installations next year, but the House committee yesterday amended a pending military construction bill to reopen the issue in as many as a dozen cases.    Facilities in San Francisco, Illinois and New Jersey would most likely be affected by the provision, which had the backing of the powerful defense subcommittee chairman, Rep. John Murtha (D., Pa.). The amendment withholds any funds from being used to carry out the closings until cost studies by the General Accounting Office are completed, and the money would be released only if GAO finds the expected savings meet criteria set by an independent commission last year.    The Interior Department and Forest Service are among the major accounts funded in the Senate-passed bill, which anticipates an additional $460 million in fiscal 1990 for clean coal technology beyond the $10.9 billion counted in the measure itself.    Funding for the National Endowment for the Arts was only marginally reduced below the $171 million level approved by the House, but the Senate measure goes further in seeking to penalize those directly involved in awarding NEA money to support two recent exhibits criticized as sacrilegious and sexually explicit. The NEA would be prohibited from awarding any direct grants for the next five years to the two sponsors in North Carolina and Philadelphia, and Sen. Jesse Helms (R., N.C.) attached an amendment specifically prohibiting the use of any funds for exhibits of homoerotic art.    Though weaker on some points than the corresponding House bill, the Senate restrictions on offshore drilling cover the same 84 million acres of U.S. waters, including Alaska's Bristol Bay and much of the East and West Coasts.    Industry allies responded this week by attaching an amendment to prohibit oil tankers from entering these same waters if the moratoriums are still in effect in two years, and the goal was to put pressure on lawmakers to either relax the restrictions or see shipping obstructed in their home state ports. The industry also saw the provision as a means to highlight evidence that tankers pose more of an environmental risk than offshore rigs. But yesterday's vote to strip the amendment underscored how such policy distinctions are lost amid the emotions stirred by the string of spills since March when the Exxon Valdez ran aground.    Chief among the timber provisions in the bill are those seeking to force at least a temporary settlement between environmental and timber interests in Oregon and Washington states, where logging has been halted on tens of thousands of acres of federal land by lawsuits seeking to protect the northern spotted owl. The language, which has the backing of Speaker Thomas Foley in the House, would overturn current injunctions if no agreement is reached in the next two months. But environmentalists are assured of reduced cutting levels and language to protect old stands of timber favored by the owl.    Further refinements were added yesterday to ensure that the courts have a role in overseeing future forest sales. But timber interests themselves were on the defensive in the fight over road funds for the Forest Service nationally. The $65 million cut is a major blow in a chamber where Western interests have such sway, and the remaining $140 million is only slightly more than what has been approved by the House. The $27 billion transportation bill approved by the House committee yesterday would provide $11.87 billion in direct appropriations and an estimated $15.17 billion drawn from trust funds for highway and airport development. Funding for the Federal Aviation Administration would grow to $7.25 billion, including a 25% increase for facilities and equipment, and funds available for grants to airports would be increased to $1.5 billion-$150 million more than the Bush administration requested.    Amtrak, another budget target for the president, would be preserved at a $614 million funding level, but the federal subsidies for air carriers serving rural areas was reduced by $19.2 million, 60% below current levels. In a debate etched with bitterness, rural lawmakers angrily challenged the cut as too deep, but after first prevailing on a show of hands, they lost 26-25 in an effort to restore an estimated $9.3 million to the program.    The military construction bill -- which carries the new base-closing language -- allocated $8.7 billion to the Pentagon to construct and maintain facilities. The House committee yesterday approved a third spending bill appropriating $1.59 billion for Congress's own budget for the next fiscal year. Significant increases are provided for the offices of House leaders, but the more sensitive issue going into an election year was a nearly $81 million rise to cover mail sent out by both houses.    Separately, the legislative appropriations subcommittee quietly approved recently a $7 million reprogramming to carry out an expansion of the Capitol at the terrace level of the west front of the building. Another $9.8 million was previously reprogrammed last fall for improvements to the terrace area, and the funds will come from a major surplus left in the initial $49 million appropriation to restore the west front. </TEXT></DOC>
