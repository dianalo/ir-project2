The 23 British and 64 Australians soldiers, part of the U.N.monitoring force, flew from the capital of Windhoek to Grootfonteintown, then drove northward to assembly points and border posts.   Starting Tuesday, guerrillas of the South-West Africa People'sOrganization are to report to the posts and assembly points for thepeacekeepers to escort them back bases in Angola.   About 1,900 guerrillas nearly derailed a U.N.-sponsored plan tobring independence to this former German colony when they crossedthe border from Angola and heavy fighting broke out with SouthAfrican-led security forces April 1.   A partially deployed U.N. monitoring force was criticized fornot being able to check the incursions.   On Sunday, after South Africa reported at least 263 of hisguerrillas were killed, SWAPO President Sam Nujoma ordered theinsurgents to leave Namibia. South African, Cuban and Angolanofficials agreed at a weekend meeting to give the guerrillas untilSaturday to leave with a guarantee of safe passage. U.S. and Sovietofficials observed the meeting at a Namibian game lodge.   Police reported calm in the northern bush for the second dayMonday, and said they are waiting to see whether the guerrillasobey orders to leave. The lull follows the fiercest fighting in the23-year war for this mineral-rich territory, which South Africa hasruled since World War I.   Martti Ahtisaari of Finland, the special U.N. envoy in Namibia,told a news conference no official cease-fire is in effect, ``butthe South Africans have undertaken to restrain their forces.''   South African Foreign Minister Pik Botha said of the guerrillasSunday night: ``If they do not attack, they will not be attacked.''   At least 263 guerrillas and 28 security force members have beenkilled in the fighting, acccording to South African officials.SWAPO says its losses were much lower and charges nearly one-fifthof those killed were civilians.   Ahtisaari said the United Nations will begin flying its flag atnoon Tuesday at two churches south of the Angolan border and atseven along the border. The assembly points will be expanded to 18.The information also will be broadcast on the radio, he saidthrough an aide.   The agreement was a major concession by South Africa, Ahtisaarisaid.   Botha said the guerrillas who assemble at churches insideNamibia will have to give their weapons to U.N. forces, who willthen fly them to bases in Angola.   Guerrillas who travel to churches along the Namibian-Angolanborder will be allowed to keep their arms and the Angolangovernment will take responsibility for returning them to theirbases, Botha said.   South Africa contends SWAPO has sent more than 1,900 guerrillasinto northern Namibia from Angola since April 1 in violation of theU.N.-sponsored accord, which requires them to remain at bases atleast 100 miles inside Angola until mid-May.   SWAPO had maintained that the guerrillas were inside Namibiaprior to April and should be allowed to set up bases in theterritory.   But Nujoma said he decided to pull out his fighters because hedid not want to give South Africa an excuse to cancel Namibia'sindependence plans.   Some U.N. officials have suggested SWAPO field commandersmistakenly thought their units could return to Namibia beginningApril 1. Several captured guerrillas have said they returned toNamibia in search of U.N. personnel and expected no confrontationswith security forces.   The United Nations has authorized a peacekeeping force of 4,650soldiers for Namibia, but only about 1,000 have arrived.   SWAPO is favored to win the most votes in pre-independenceelections scheduled for November under the U.N.-sponsored accord.   The way for Namibian independence was cleared in December whenSouth Africa, Angola and Cuba signed a regional peace plan.   Cuba agreed to withdraw 50,000 Cuban troops who have helpedMarxist-ruled Angola battle U.S.-backed rebels. In exchange, SouthAfrica agreed to stop supporting the Angolan rebels and allowNamibia to become independent.</TEXT></DOC>
