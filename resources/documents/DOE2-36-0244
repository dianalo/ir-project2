Such studies enhance ourunderstanding of the role of the vacuum in field theory, and provideessential input for several experimental programs. A variety of modelsfor the nuclear and nucleon form factors have been considered, revealingsome degree of sensitivity to assumptions about sub-nuclear structure.We predict that the cross sections, even at high invariant masses andtransverse momenta, are large on hadronic scales, and should act as usefulprobes of nuclear and nucleon form factors. 21 refs., 5 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
