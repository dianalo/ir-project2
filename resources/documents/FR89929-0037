This action is authorized under regulationsimplementing the Pacific Coast Groundfish Fishery Management Plan (FMP)and is necessary because the likelihood of biological stress is greatlyincreased if landings of widow rockfish are not further restricted. Thisaction is intended to lower fishing rates, to reduce the risk of biologicalstress while allowing for unavoidable incidental catches in other fisheries,and to reduce the probability of fishery closure before the end of theyear.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATES: </T2>Effective 0001 hours, local time, October 11, 1989, untilmodified, superseded, or rescinded.

The Secretary published a noticeof fishing restrictions on May 2, 1989 (54 FR 18658), which announced concurrencewith the Council's recommendations.The current weekly trip limit for widow rockfish is 10,000 pounds, whichmay be taken in only one landing a week above 3,000 pounds. A biweeklytrip limit option also is available. Reduction of the trip limit to 3,000pounds with no frequency restriction is necessary to eliminate target fishingwhile minimizing the waste of widow rockfish caught unavoidably while fishingfor other groundfish species. If the OY is reached before the end of thecalendar year, further landings of widow rockfish will be prohibited andthose that continue to be caught incidentally would be discarded. As aresult, fishing mortality would exceed the OY and the resource would bewasted even though landings were prohibited. Catches in excess of the OYincrease the likelihood of inducing biological stress on widow rockfish.Based on observed and expected rates of landings, the best available scientificinformation as of August 29, 1989, indicate that the 12,400 mt OY willbe reached on October 24, 1989, if landings are not slowed. The 3,000 poundtrip limit must be implemented on October 11, 1989, in order to avoid reachingthe OY before the end of the year. Therefore, on October 11, 1989, a 3,000pound trip limit for widow rockfish, with no restriction on the numberof landings, replaces the current weekly trip limit of 10,000 pounds andthe biweekly trip limit option. All other provisions pertaining to widowrockfish at 54 FR 18658 remain in effect. Washington, Oregon, and Californiaare implementing this action concurrently.<ITAG tagnum="84">Secretarial Action</ITAG>The Secretary concurs with the Council's recommendation, and for the reasonsstated above announces: Effective at 0001 hours local time on October 11,1989, no more than 3,000 pounds (rough weight) of widow rockfish may betaken and retained, or landed per vessel per fishing trip.<ITAG tagnum="84">Other Fisheries</ITAG>U.S. vessels operating under an experimental fishing permit issued under50 CFR 663.10 also are subject to these restrictions unless otherwise providedin the permit.Landings of groundfish in the pink shrimp, spot and ridgeback prawn fisheriesare governed by regulations at 50 CFR 663.28. If fishing for groundfishand pink shrimp, spot or ridgeback prawns in the same fishing trip, thegroundfish restrictions in this notice apply.<ITAG tagnum="84">Classification</ITAG>The determination to impose this restriction is based on the most recentdata available. The aggregate data upon which the determination is basedare available for public inspection at the office of the Director, NorthwestRegion (see Addresses) during business hours until the end of the commentperiod.An Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) was prepared for the FMP in 1982in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). The alternativesand environmental impacts of this notice are not significantly differentthan those considered in the EIS for the FMP. Therefore this action iscategorically excluded from the NEPA requirements to prepare an EnvironmentalAssessment in accordance with paragraph 5a(3) of the NOAA Directives Manual02-10, because the alternatives and their impacts have not changed significantly.This action is taken under the authority of 50 CFR 663.22 and 663.23, andis in compliance with Executive Order 12291. This action is not subjectto the Regulatory Flexibility Act because there is no notice and commentperiod preceding the effective date of this notice. The actions do notcontain policies with federalism implications sufficient to warrant preparationof a federalism assessment under Executive Order 12612.Section 663.23 of the groundfish regulations states that the Secretarywill publish a notice of action reducing fishing levels in proposed formunless he determines that prior notice and public review are impracticable,unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest. Section 663.23 also statesthat any notice issued under this section will not be effective until 30days after publication in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> unless the Secretary finds and publishes withthe notice good cause for an earlier effective date. If landings of widowrockfish are not restricted, premature closure of this fishery will occur,resulting in discards of incidentally caught widow rockfish and disruptionof the market for this species. In addition, widow rockfish will continueto be caught in fisheries for other species resulting in catches abovethe OY, increasing the likelihood of biological stress on the widow rockfishresource. Accordingly, further delay of this action is impracticable andcontrary to the public interest, and this action is published in finalform.The public has had the opportunity to comment on this action. The publicparticipated in Groundfish Select Group, Groundfish Management Team, andCouncil meetings in November 1988, April 1989, and July 1989 that generatedthis management action and that was endorsed by the Council and the Secretary.A public comment period followed publication of the May 2, 1989, notice(54 FR 18658) announcing the intent to take this action. Further publiccomments will be accepted for 15 days after the date of filing with theOffice of the Federal Register.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 50 CFR Part 663</ITAG>Fisheries, Fishing.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority:</T4> 16 U.S.C. 1801 <T3>et seq.</T3></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: September 25, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Richard H.
