Accusations of overcharging are investigated by the inspector general, and NASA promptly seeks reimbursement of all funds identified as overcharges.    These facts were emphasized clearly to the author when he came to NASA with an extensive list of specific incidents and asked for comment. NASA and the inspector general's response included volumes of documents covering more than a decade of operations with detailed explanations of how cases were resolved, or their status if not resolved. Virtually none of this material appears in the article.    Instead, the examples the reporter cites, which he claims are &quot;revealed in previously secret reports,&quot; took place in the past, were investigated at the time and reported in the press. Throughout the article, Mr. Kwitny promotes the premise that if a NASA contractor is accused, then that contractor is guilty -- regardless of the investigative results. The material in Mr. Kwitny's possession, provided by us and others, demonstrates that charges of impropriety are vigorously pursued and adjudicated.    William Sheehan   Associate Administrator for Communications   NASA   Washington   ---   Mr. Kwitny accuses NASA of rolling over for contractors that overcharge or submit inflated claims. I cannot speak to the accuracy or inaccuracy of the specific charges regarding other parts of NASA, but I can speak about NASA's Ames Research Center. NASA-Ames does not roll over.    I acknowledge that the increasing plethora of regulations burdening the procurement process, coupled with the decreasing numbers of federal employees available to work through this thicket of regulations, leaves many compromised settlements of improper claims. We at NASA-Ames, however, have a firm policy of not giving in. We believe that overreaching contractors will know that NASA-Ames will not be an easy touch.    Dale L. Compton   Director (Acting)   NASA-Ames Research Center   Moffett Field, Calif.   ---   Virtually all the items used as a basis for your article were at least five years old (and were reported widely in the media in the past). Further, you ignored the fact that these issues had been negotiated and settled years ago within the system provided for resolving such matters.    As I stressed to Mr. Kwitny late last year, Rockwell strongly believes that many of the NASA inspector general's findings used as the basis for the article are incomplete and inaccurate. Mr. Kwitny was provided far more detail by NASA regarding the issues in question, and he continued to ignore facts other than those that served his purposes in developing the article.    For that reason the premise of the article is a distortion -- a poorly spun yarn based on an irrelevant, disconnected summary of dead issues. It chooses to oversimplify the complexities of numerous individual issues and its intent is to suggest mismanagement and negligence on programs that have been managed conscientiously and effectively.    Your article undermined the integrity and dedication of thousands of talented Rockwell and NASA employees engaged in ably serving the nation's space program.    Richard R. Mau   Vice President, Communications   Rockwell International Corp.    El Segundo, Calif.</TEXT></DOC>
