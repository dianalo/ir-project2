While recent economic statistics have painted an ambiguouspicture, yesterday's home-building news was uniformly good.Starts increased in all regions of the country and for alltypes of houses, both single and multifamily. Buildingpermits for future construction also were up.</LP><TEXT>   Most economists said the figures were encouraging butpoint to modest growth and a plodding recovery. &quot;The numbersare too low to be consistent with a rapid expansion,&quot; saidJohn Tuccillo, chief economist of the National Association ofRealtors.   Richard Peach, deputy chief economist at the MortgageBankers Association, dismissed the notion that October's jumpin housing heralds a booming recovery. &quot;Does this somehowmake everything okay? Clearly not, but it's a very good signand it gives us some hope. We're not out of the woods yet.&quot;   Mr. Peach said that his organization has seen a steadyrise in mortgage applications since July, adding to hopesthat the housing market will continue to expand.   The underlying economic message, say most economists, isfairly clear: decreasing mortgage rates are finallypersuading people to buy houses. The pickup shows that &quot;lowinterest rates do in fact work,&quot; said Mr. Tuccillo. &quot;Theyhave succeeded in getting more marginal buyers into themarket.&quot;   Federal Reserve Gov. John LaWare said he was &quot;heartened&quot;by the report. And Deputy Treasury Secretary John Robson saidthe report was &quot;real good news&quot; because housing is &quot;one ofthe prime movers of the economy.&quot;   Housing starts made modest increases six months in a rowbefore dropping in September. The October gain helped quellfears that September's drop was the beginning of a downtrend.   The increase was the largest since February, althoughhousing start figures are often widely revised. The rise instarts was led by multifamily units, which skyrocketed 26.1%,while single-family homes rose only 3.9%.   Starts in October measured 1,096,000 at an annual rate.September's starts were revised slightly downward, to1,021,000.   Building permits, sometimes seen as foreshadowing futurehousing starts, rose 5.4%, their second monthly gain in arow.   All figures are adjusted for seasonal variations.</TEXT></DOC>
