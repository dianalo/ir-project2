Police said gunmen in a stolen car shot and killed RobertoFuentes Morrison, a retired security agent accused of being amongthe most notorious violators.   ``This situation must be resolved now, whatever the protests bysome people,'' Pinochet said in Iquique, a port city 1,150 milesnorth of Santiago. His comments were carried by local radio stations.   ``If we want to stop all this fighting, if we want to preventthings from getting ugly again, we have to put an end to all thesethings,'' said the 73-year-old president and army commander, whoseized power in a coup 16 years ago.   He said the matter must be settled before March 11, 1990, when hesteps down in favor of a civilian president to be elected inDecember.   Pinochet said he was not worried about himself, ``but I do worryabout my people. For me, my people come first.''   It was the second time this week the general showed concern aboutpossible human rights trials under the next government. LastTuesday, he said the military will not tolerate such trials byspecial courts or the legislature.   ``I can not accept that members of the services be taken astargets for revenge or that special courts be organized inCongress,'' he said.   Speaking to reporters Friday in Iquique, Pinochet said a newamnesty law would cover everyone, apparently meaning both humanrights violators and terrorists. ``There will be no blacks norwhites; this is over,'' he said.   A 1978 amnesty law covered all human rights violations andterrorist acts from 1973 to 1978.   That amnesty has been applied recently _ favoring, among others,Gen. Manuel Conteras, director of the now-disbanded DINA secretpolice, and Fuentes, the man killed Friday as he left his home inSantiago.   After the coup ousted President Salvador Allende, an avowedMarxist, in September 1973, security agents rounded up hundreds ofleftists and many were tortured or killed. The Roman Catholic Churchand human rights groups have documented about 750 cases ofdissidents who disappeared after arrest.   The opposition, widely expected to win the December election,says it does not seek revenge but intends ``to find the truth''about human rights abuses and bring those responsible to trial.   Police sources said Fuentes was hit by 13 bullets when four orfive attackers who fired automatic weapons from the stolen car as heleft his home. The attackers fled.   Fuentes, in his mid-50s, was a leading member of the JointCommand, a secret police unit accused of serious human rightsviolations after the coup.</TEXT></DOC>
