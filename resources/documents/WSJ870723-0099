Espousing a strong free-market philosophy, Mr. Ruder, 58 years old, said at his confirmation hearing before the Senate Banking Committee that the government should take a hands-off approach to takeovers because they benefit shareholders. &quot;The shareholders own American corporations, and I believe the shareholders should be the chief beneficiaries of takeover legislation,&quot; he stated. Shareholders of target companies often receive premiums of about 50% of present stock value, he argued.    The free-market ideology espoused by Mr. Ruder, a registered Republican, should serve him well with the like-minded Reagan administration, but it promises to cause friction in Congress, which has been moving toward tighter control of the securities industry. The Senate recently authorized a 30% increase in the SEC's budget, pending approval by the full Congress, citing a need for stepped-up SEC actions.    Still, Senate Banking Chairman William Proxmire (D., Wis.) predicted that Mr. Ruder would have no trouble winning Senate confirmation.    Some have expressed concern that Mr. Ruder, a Northwestern University law professor, lacks practical experience. Most previous SEC chairmen have been drawn from top Wall Street law firms. &quot;The question on Mr. Ruder's nomination is: Does he bring the will to act and act vigorously to clean up our capital markets?&quot; said Sen. Proxmire.    Sen. Proxmire added that he is uncertain whether he will vote to confirm Mr. Ruder because he disagrees with the nominee's views on the benefits of hostile takeovers. Sen. Proxmire and several other Senate Democrats are sponsoring legislation to curb what they term as abuses in the takeover process.    Mr. Ruder, echoing acting SEC Chairman Charles Cox, said he generally opposes the proposed takeover legislation. While insisting he made no pledge to the White House to oppose specific legislation, he confirmed that his views on the takeover issue were of special concern to the administration. The White House adamantly opposes any new takeover legislation.    Several Democrats chastised Mr. Ruder for his opposition to tougher government regulation of takeovers. Disputing the nominee's view that the benefits for shareholders are of paramount concern, Sen. Terry Sanford (D., N.C.) suggested the government also should consider the impact on company employees and the surrounding community in evaluating a proposed takeover.    Mr. Ruder countered that the federal government shouldn't have the primary role in setting policy to deal with such concerns. &quot;I don't have enough information to know which takeovers are going to produce good results and which takeovers are going to produce bad results,&quot; he argued.    Mr. Ruder endorsed the idea of reducing to five days from 10 days the period within which someone must disclose when he has acquired more than 5% of a company. He also said he favors, as has the SEC, requiring that someone who holds more than 5% of a company's shares should be prevented from buying additional shares until he discloses his stake. But Mr. Ruder said that moving the reporting threshold down to 3%, as some pending bills propose, would result in a bureacratic headache.    Looking ahead, the nominee said he expected to concentrate his efforts at the SEC in three areas: the computerization of stock trading, increasing the use of computers to make required disclosures and the internationalization of the securities markets. He also said he intends to continue a number of current SEC efforts, including its investigation into municipal securities, efforts to develop a definition of insider trading and plans to implement a one-share, one-vote requirement for new stocks to be listed by exchanges. </TEXT></DOC>
