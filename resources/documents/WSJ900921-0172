The results add up to a bleak outlook on the part ofconsumers and small investors about several major bulwarks ofthe economy and the financial markets. Fully 55% of thosepolled said they believe the banking system is just somewhatsound or not at all sound. An equal number believeresidential real estate values are stalled and will stay thesame or go down in the near future.</LP><TEXT>   Overall, half of those polled said they think the economywill get worse in the next year, a stark increase from theone-third who held that pessimistic view only two months ago.In a signal that they are concerned about their own finances,half believe that a recession would affect them directly.   And in what looks like more bad news for beleaguered WallStreet, 52% of respondents said they were somewhatuncomfortable or very uncomfortable about putting money instocks. No other category prompted such concern, including sospeculative a play as precious metals, about which 47% saidthey were somewhat or very uncomfortable, and investment realestate, which leaves 32% uneasy. Barely more than one in 10describe themselves as very comfortable about stocks.   Nevertheless, Americans coming off nearly a decade ofprosperity are hardly showing signs of hysteria. Half reportthat their financial assets have increased in the past fiveyears, and they say they are doing just what you'd expect:drawing in purse strings, trying to save more and cuttingback on big purchases. The poll, taken over four days endingTuesday, surveyed registered voters only. It is one of fourquarterly surveys that take an in-depth look at a specificsubject.   &quot;People are worried and pulling in, but they aren'tpanicking,&quot; observe pollsters Peter Hart and Robert Teeter,who conducted the survey for The Wall Street Journal and NBCNews. &quot;While there is a distinct sense of hunkering down, thefact is that these are by and large people who play it prettysafe to begin with -- and thus still feel pretty comfortableabout their own money, despite their concerns about what ishappening in the overall economy,&quot; they say.   For instance, despite their worries about the bankingsystem and the high-profile problems of the savings and loanindustry, Americans put certificates of deposit and savingsaccounts at the top of the list of investments about whichthey feel very comfortable or somewhat comfortable. Abouteight in 10 respondents list CDs and savings accounts inthose categories.   They're right to feel safe about those bank accounts:Federal deposit insurance has protected all depositors up to$100,000 per account. And they like that coverage despite thehuge $150 billion tab -- that's before interest costs -- forthe broke Sandamp;L deposit insurance system they will be paying astaxpayers. Of those polled, 52% oppose limiting depositors toonly one account insured to $100,000 (currently, depositorscan have an unlimited number in different institutions), anidea that is in vogue on Capitol Hill these days. In a JulyJournal/ NBC poll, a majority of voters opposed lowering the$100,000 limit by 57% to 32%.   In some other ways, however, the caution revealed in thepoll could be costly for investors. Many investmentprofessionals would question the respondents' deep uneasinessabout investing in stocks, at least over the long run.   Right now, the preference for supersafe cash investmentslike bank CDs is &quot;about the right attitude, but most timesit's not,&quot; says James Solloway, director of economic researchat Argus Research Corp., a New York investment advisory firm.&quot;Undoubtedly, stocks are riskier than a CD, but over time youare compensated quite nicely for taking that extra risk,&quot; hesays.   About half of those polled say they are cutting down onpurchases and other spending, the highest level all year andan increase from four in 10 who reported cutting back inJuly. Only 10% said they are increasing spending. That wasthe lowest level of the year. One-third of respondents saythey are putting off a major purchase, such as a home or anew car, because of concerns about the economy.   Three-quarters say they've found ways to economize in thethings they buy, and 56% have cut back on luxury items. Onlyabout one-third have changed vacation plans to save money,which Messrs. Teeter and Hart take as a sign that consumersaren't in a frenzied retreat.   Americans do appear to be concerned about their stakes intheir homes. And they don't see real estate as a sure bet forincreasing value in the near future, as it was in manyregions over the past decade.   Only about one-third believe they'd get more for theirhouse now than a year ago, while 27% think they'd get less. Abare majority, 52%, believe this is a good time to buy ahome, while 38% believe it is not. Back in August 1986,three-quarters said it was a good time to buy a home.   There is not a single region where a majority believeshousing prices are on their way up. Still, regionaldifferences are striking. The Northeast clearly has thebiggest population of woeful real-estate value watchers. Inthat region, a mere 28% of respondents see housing pricesgoing up. In other parts of the country, by contrast, about45% of those polled see prices currently heading up.   Lyle Gramley, chief economist with the Mortgage BankersAssociation of America, notes that home prices, as measuredby the median resale price of existing homes, rose 3% to 4%over the past year. And he looks for &quot;more of the same&quot; inthe current year.   David W. Berson, chief economist of Federal NationalMortgage Association, says that &quot;even in deep recessions,home prices tend to go up.&quot; That was the case, for instance,in 1982. But he explains that one reason home prices rarelydrop is that many homeowners simply put off selling untiltimes are better.   Perhaps not surprisingly, far fewer homeowners thannon-homeowners are expecting higher housing prices. Ofhomeowners, 36% foresee higher prices. Of those who don't ownhomes, 52% expect higher prices.   ---                      Rating Investments                                                                                                          &quot;Please tell me whether you would feel very comfortableputting yor money in this type of investment, somewhatcomfortable, somewhat uncomfortable, or very uncomfortableputting your money in this type of investment.&quot;                                                                                                                                                 UNCOM-      NOT                           COMFORTABLE  FORTABLE     SURE                                                                                                          Savings Account             86%         11%         3%   Certificate of Deposit      77          17          6   Bonds                       67          25          8   Investment Real Estate      60          32          8   Money-Market Fund           59          28         13   Mutual Funds                48          35         17   Precious Metals             38          47         15   Stock                       38          52         10                                                                                                          THE WALL STREET JOURNAL/NBC NEWS POLL</TEXT></DOC>
