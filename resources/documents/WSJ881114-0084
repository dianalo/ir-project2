The gold-mine operator said that under the plan, holders of the company's common stock will be given one right for each share of common held. Each right entitles the holder to buy 1/100th of a share of a new issue of participating preferred stock at an exercise price of $60 a share.    Battle Mountain Gold said the rights are exercisable after a person or group acquires 20% of the company's common stock or begins a tender offer that would result in ownership of 30% of the common stock outstanding. It said the so-called poison pill wasn't adopted in response to any known plan to take over the company. The rights expire Nov. 10, 1998. </TEXT></DOC>
