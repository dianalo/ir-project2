The utility said only 149 workers will be affected, because 240 of the jobs already are vacant. Niagara has been trying to cut costs partly to compensate for huge overruns it incurred in constructing the Nine Mile Point 2 nuclear power plant. The company said its goal is to cut costs by $100 million in 1988. To do that, it has reduced construction budgets, frozen management salaries and hiring, and cut compensation of senior officers and directors. </TEXT></DOC>
