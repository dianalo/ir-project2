More than 1,000 students from the elite University of International Business and Economics marched through the icy air of the capital in the afternoon to protest what they said was the university's mishandling of the murder of Zang Wei, a 19-year-old student who was stabbed to death Saturday in a campus store. The circumstances surrounding Mr. Zang's death are unclear, but he apparently was stabbed in a scuffle with two nonstudents. The protesters are concerned about campus security and the medical treatment Mr. Zang received from the university.    The protesters, defying regulations issued last winter that ban demonstrations, clasped hands as they walked for nearly five hours from their campus in northeastern Beijing to the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade, which operates the university. Most students wore white paper flowers in memory of their slain colleague. A few carried wreaths.    The students, both men and women, marched quietly but defiantly. &quot;We're not afraid of anything,&quot; said a young man as he pushed his way through a thick crowd of onlookers and security police.    The protest, which participants insisted wasn't political, was the first since a wave of unrest swept some 15 campuses around China last winter. The government cracked down on the demonstrations in January and threatened harsh retaliation against any future rallies.    China's leadership is extremely wary of such protests. Last winter's rallies started with demonstrations at several universities protesting relatively mundane matters such as dormitory conditions and tuition costs. But the rallies quickly spread around the country and evolved into a broad pro-democracy movement. Eventually, workers -- who were unhappy about inflation -- joined the students on the streets, prompting the government to crack down.    Yesterday, a few dozen police tried to stop the demonstrators as they approached Changan Avenue, the main thoroughfare that leads to Tiananmen Square, where the Communists proclaimed the victory of their revolution in 1949. Several students were roughed up by policemen, and some cameras were confiscated. One student reportedly was detained. The minister of foreign trade, Zheng Tuobin, appeared on the streets to try to dissuade the marchers, who ignored his appeal to stop and marched on.    Nearly 1,000 students met with Mr. Zheng and other ministry officials last night to air their grievances. Students said they held the university accountable for their colleague's death. They criticized school security for allowing intruders onto campus. And they blasted the university's medical staff, which initially refused to treat Mr. Zang. The clinic transferred Mr. Zang to a nearby hospital where, after what students say were further delays in providing treatment, he died early Sunday morning.    The students criticized the school's leadership for its slow, &quot;bureaucratic&quot; handling of the situation and shouted down some of Mr. Zheng's statements as &quot;rubbish.&quot; They also demanded a reorganization of the university's leadership.    &quot;The university doesn't care about its students,&quot; a young marcher told a journalist as public-security officials muscled in to take his picture. &quot;We demanded an explanation from university authorities, who wouldn't listen. So we decided to march.&quot;    Beijing is braced for possible further student demonstrations tomorrow, the 52nd anniversary of China's anti-Japanese student movement. The marchers won permission from Mr. Zheng to hold a memorial rally tomorrow for their dead colleague. </TEXT></DOC>
