Harrett, CORN contracting officer, said FAA also extended thedeadline for proposals to July 27 to allow vendors more time to review theRFP and the amendments.andP;  Contract award is scheduled for Sept. 30.andM;Michael Sherwin, FAA's director of management systems, said the latestamendment &quot;reduces the risk for bidders by clarifying the wording of theRFP.&quot;andP;  He said the new amendments assign &quot;the order in the use of the sourcecode, guides and the documentation materials provided to the contractor forconversion.&quot;andM;He said the amendments give &quot;more details about the data that would be madeavailable to assist the contractor's testing during the conversion tasks.andO;These changes remove the uncertainty as to what is required of thecontractor, what information will be available to the contractor and what thecontractor's performance will be measured against.&quot;andM;Sherwin said the amendments are designed to attract bidders back into thecompetition.andP;  &quot;We think that the full understanding of what is required ofthe contractor is going to make it easier for the contractors to assess wherethey stand regarding this requirement and whether they can be competitive,&quot;he said.andM;Vendors had complained that risks of a fixed-price conversion of the multipleexisting systems to a single new architecture were too high.andP;  The RFP alsorequires the winning bidder to provide the hardware.andP;  One industry sourcesaid the hardware alone could cost between $50 million and $100 million,meaning that large sums are at stake.andM;The only known competing for the contract is Electronic Data Systems Corp.andO;Representatives of four other potential bidders -- Martin Marietta Corp.,andO;Science applications International Corp., Boeing Computer Services andSysorex Information Systems Inc. -- said they had decided not to submit bids.andM;Sherwin had said earlier that more than one vendor would bid on CORN, butmore recently he acknowledged he could not be sure other vendors would enterthe competition.andP;  &quot;There is a lot of noise being made about it, but I won'tknow if anyone has changed their mind until after the deadline forproposals,&quot; he said.andM;Dennis Brown, vice president of Martin Marietta's Federal Systems IntegrationDivision, said he had not seen the amendments, and predicted his companywould probably not re-enter the bidding.andM;Sysorex vice president Ronald J. Maylor said he had not seen the most recentamendment, Sysorex was not concerned abou the risks of conversion, he said,but rather the company's late start on preparing a proposal.andM;John Alter, Boeing's manager of public relations, said although the newamendments may reduce the risks associated with CORN, &quot;I think they're tryingto work up a lather again.andP;  The third amendment does nothing for us.&quot;andM;Sherwin said the contract will remain fixed-price.andP;  &quot;In this third amendment,as well as the first and second amendments, we managed to reduce the risk toa manageable level to any responsible bidder out there,&quot; he said.andP;  The latestamendment is the third issued by FA since the request for proposals wasissued Feb. 27.andM;CORN is intended to replace all of the FAA's large systems with a singlearchitecture.andP;  Major hardware to be replaced includes 12 Data General systemsand an IBM 3084 mainframe in FAA's Oklahoma City computer center.andM;CORN also will include optional data processing equipment for otherTransportation Department agencies.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
