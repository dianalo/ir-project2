(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   While the PTL's deposed leader strugglesin a federal courtroom, the Rev. Sam Johnson faces a differentbattle _ rebuilding the image of the church that was left behind.   ``I sometimes envy the ministries that weren't affected by thePTL mess,'' said Johnson, now the pastor of Heritage Church, whichhas moved from the 2,300-acre PTL park near here to three concretebuildings in a lower-middle-class neighborhood. ``Some ministrieswere affected by the scandal. But we were the scandal. We were theeye of the storm.''   Heritage Church was founded by Jim Bakker, whose trial on fraudand conspiracy charges begins this week in federal court. The jurywas selected last week.   Richard Dortch, Bakker's top assistant from 1984 to 1987, alreadyhas pleaded guilty to four fraud and conspiracy charges and wassentenced last week to eight years in prison and a $200,000 fine.   It was Dortch who asked Johnson, then PTL's executive in chargeof missions, for a $10,000 loan to handle a ``kook'' who wasthreatening the ministry.   The ``kook'' turned out to be Jessica Hahn, whose tryst withBakker in 1980 eventually led to the television evangelist'sresignation from PTL in March 1987. Dortch, investigations showed,arranged a payoff of $265,000 in ministry funds to buy her silence.   The $10,000 loan landed Johnson a seat before the federal grandjury that investigated PTL for 16 months before indicting Bakker,Dortch and James and David Taggart _ two former Bakker assistantswho have been convicted of tax evasion and face up to 25 years inprison and $1 million in fines each in sentencing scheduled Sept. 8.   Johnson, who left PTL in disgust one month after Bakker resigned,was not indicted. He later returned to take over Heritage Church.   The church, Johnson said last week, has been badly battered bythe PTL fall.   The television ministry is struggling to carry on nightlybroadcasts. Last Wednesday, the church rented an extra hour ofsatellite time to appeal for funds and said the television shows maybe off the air soon in New York, Los Angeles and other major markets.   As for the numbers attending services in person, Johnson avoidscomparison figures, but the church's former sanctuary was aboutthree times the size of the one the congregation has now. Johnson,instead, compares the church to Samson of the Bible.   ``His eyes were poked out, his hair had been cut off, he had losthis beauty,'' Johnson said of the Old Testament character. ``But hishair grew back and the Spirit returned to him. And the last verse ofthat story is important _ it says he killed more Philistines in thatfinal day than his entire life before.   ``He came back from the lowest point of his life to a greatvictory,'' said Johnson, a Bible school classmate of Bakker's.   Prosecutors contend that Bakker and other PTL executives diverted$4 million in donations to the ministry to support fancy homes,designer clothing and lavish travel.   Three months after Bakker resigned, PTL was put under bankruptcyprotection and the church was left to face his disenchanted formersupporters.   ``The bitterness was heaped on us from time to time,'' Johnsonsaid.   Prosecutors say PTL raised $158 million between 1984 and 1987through ``lifetime partnerships'' that promised supporters threenights lodging per year for life in the hotels being constructed atHeritage USA, PTL's expansive retreat near here.   Prosecutors say the money was diverted to support the Bakkers'plush lifestyle. In those years, Bakker and his wife, Tammy Faye,drew $3.5 million in bonuses plus other perks.   ``I do not believe that people begrudge them the salaries, thoughthey were excessive,'' Johnson said. ``And I think people couldforgive him for the Jessica Hahn thing.   ``But what hurt the most were the broken promises,'' Johnsonsaid. ``That's what brought the bitterness, the hurt among those whobelieved in the ministry.''   In the church's new surroundings there is no Heritage GrandHotel, no covered shopping mall, no sprawling water park.   ``It's an old gymnasium,'' Johnson said, looking out at the rowsof folding chairs.   ``We're back to the basics here. We're not about buildings andland and water parks here, but the spirit is with us.''   The church bought the folding chairs, six television cameras anda broadcast truck from Stephen Mernick, the Canadian businessman whobought Heritage USA through the bankruptcy court. Mernick sold theequipment at a bargain, Johnson said, helping the ministry to stayon the airwaves.   The move from Bakker's dream resort came from necessity, Johnsonsaid, but it may have symbolic value in showing to journalists andothers drawn here by the Bakker trial that the church is no longerBakker's church.   ``We're hoping that when they come here, they'll see this is notthe same place, that there's a different spirit here now,'' Johnsonsaid.</TEXT></DOC>
