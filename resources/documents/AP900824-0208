The two houses went up in flames, but their occupants escapedinjury.   Killed were pilot Michael Spear, 49, president of The Rouse Co.,his wife, Judy, 47, and their 19-year-old daughter, Jodi, policesaid.   The company's projects include Boston's Faneuil Hall shoppingarea, Harbor Place on the Baltimore waterfront, South StreetSeaport in New York and Underground Atlanta.   ``This is a terrible loss to the Rouse Co. and to the country,''said James W. Rouse, retired founder of the Columbia, Md.-basedcompany. ``Mike Spear was a brilliant, compassionate, wise man. Hisleadership was tremendous. In many respects, he is irreplaceble.Judy was a wonderful woman who made a great contribution in her ownright, as well as to Mike's work.''   The Spears lived in Columbia, Md., but had a summer home inChatham on Cape Cod.   Spear joined Rouse in 1967 as director of market research andproject evaluation. From 1971 to 1978, he was general manager ofthe Columbia project that established the planned city betweenBaltimore and Washington. Spear was named executive vice presidentfor development in 1978. He became president in 1986. He and hiswife had three other daughters.   Federal officials are investigating the cause of the crash.   The plane went down on a dead-end street in the city's Mattapansection. The small white airplane crashed into a driveway betweentwo houses, incinerating two parked cars and setting the houses onfire.   Spear left foggy Cape Cod around 6 a.m. in his two-engineCheyenne turboprop, bound for Logan International Airport. Hisdaughter was to fly from there to Tokyo, where she planned to studythis fall, said a friend of the family.   The aircraft was 20 miles from Logan when Spear reported enginetrouble, said Michael Ciccarelli, spokesman for the FederalAviation Administration. About seven miles from the airport hebegan efforts to land.   Spear first reported lack of speed, then smoke, then that anengine was out. At 6:30 a.m. the plane disappeared from the radarscreen. Visibility was one-quarter of a mile, said FAA spokeswomanGail Lattrell.   People in the neighborhood said they heard a low-flyingaircraft, the sound of an engine cutting out and then a thud as theplane hit the ground.   ``I was in bed, not asleep, when I heard this tremendousexplosion,'' said Neal Silver, 66, who lives a few houses from thecrash site. ``My neighbors were pounding on the door. I looked outand I could see these whole two buildings engulfed in flames.''   Neighbors poured into the street as thick black smoke billowedto the sky.   Mayor Raymond Flynn sent dispatched teams of post-trauma expertsto the neighborhood to help people there deal with the disaster.   The Red Cross and other agencies offered emergency assistance tothe displaced families.</TEXT></DOC>
