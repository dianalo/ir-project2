When landing rates have been projected to reach an acceptablebiological catch (ABC) estimate or quota before the end of the year, triplimits have been recommended by the Pacific Fishery Management Council(Council) and imposed by the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary) to preventor reduce biological stress while minimizing disruption of traditionalfisheries. To achieve these objectives, the management measures have alsobeen designed to extend the fishery as long as possible throughout theyear, and to allow catches taken unavoidably while fishing for other species(incidental catches) to be landed to minimize the waste of fish that otherwisemust be discarded once a quota is reached. By slowing the fishery and avoidingpremature closure that must occur when a quota is reached, the discardingof incidental catches is minimized and the likelihood of biological stressfrom fishing above the OY is lessened. At its November 1988 meeting, the Council endorsed the determination ofits Groundfish Management Team (GMT) that if landings of widow rockfishand sablefish were unrestricted in 1989, the likelihood of biological stresson those stocks would be increased. Trip limits and quotas were imposedon January 1, 1989 (53 FR 299, January 5, 1989) which were intended tolower fishing rates, prevent biological stress, allow unavoidable incidentalcatches to be landed, and avoid or reduce the probability of fishery closuresbefore the end of the year.At the April 1989 Council meeting, the GMT projected that the landing ratesfor widow rockfish and sablefish were too high and that the quotas wouldbe reached well before the end of the year. In its deliberations on adjustingthe current fishing restrictions, the Council considered advice from theGMT (state and Federal fishery and social scientists), Groundfish AdvisorySubpanel (fishing industry and consumer representatives), the concernedpublic, and a Select Group created by the Council for the purpose of recommendingmethods of limiting landings with minimal disruption to the fishing industry.The Select Group included representatives from the fishing industry, theCouncil, the Scientific and Statistical Committee, and the GMT. The Council'srecommendations and subsequent actions taken by the Secretary on thoserecommendations are presented below.<ITAG tagnum="84">Widow Rockfish </ITAG>The 1989 optimum yield (OY) quota for widow rockfish is 12,400 metric tons(mt). At the April 3-7, 1989, Council meeting, the GMT advised that coastwidelandings through March 25, 1989, were 6,908 mt, an increase of about 36percent from 1988. Based on observed and expected landing rates, the GMTprojected that the OY would be reached by August 4, 1989, and that landingsof widow rockfish must be reduced by 51 percent to spread the remainderof the OY over the rest of the year. At the April Council meeting, various levels of reduction were considered.The Council concluded that immediate reduction to a 3,000 pound incidentaltrip limit at this time (as recommended by the Council at its November1988 meeting) would put a disproportionate disadvantage on the midwatertrawl fleet, which generally makes larger landings, and benefit the rollertrawl fleet, which generally makes smaller and more frequent landings.Therefore, the Council recommended an intermediate level of reduction inthe weekly trip limit, from 30,000 pounds to 10,000 pounds, with a biweeklyoption as is currently allowed for landings of yellowtail rockfish andthe <T3>Sebastes</T3> complex of rockfish. The biweekly option accommodatesvessels that are capable of longer and larger trips than allowed underthe weekly limit. The Council reiterated its recommendation that if the10,000 pound trip limit does not sufficiently slow the catch, the Secretaryshould impose a 3,000 pound trip limit (with no frequency restriction)on whatever date necessary to assure that the 12,400 mt OY will not bereached before the end of the year. Secretarial Action: The Secretary concurs with the Council's recommendationand herein announces: (1) <T3>Weekly trip limit. </T3>No more than 10,000 pounds (round weight) ofwidow rockfish may be taken and retained, possessed, or landed per vesselper fishing trip in a one-week period. Only one landing of widow rockfishabove 3,000 pounds (round weight) may be made per vessel in that one-weekperiod. ``One-week period'' means seven consecutive days beginning 0001hours Wednesday and ending 2400 hours Tuesday, local time. (2) <T3>Biweekly trip limit option. </T3>If the fishery management agency ofthe state where the fish will be landed is notified as required by statelaw (WAC 220-44-050: OAR 635-04-033: CFandamp;GCA 7652), no more than 20,000pounds (round weight) of widow rockfish may be taken and retained, possessed,or landed per vessel per fishing trip in a two-week period. After notificationis given, and while it remains in effect, only one landing of widow rockfishabove 3,000 pounds (round weight) may be made per vessel in that two-weekperiod. ``Two-week period'' means 14 consecutive days beginning 0001 hoursWednesday and ending 2400 hours Tuesday, local time. Notification proceduresfor biweekly landings of widow rockfish are the same as for yellowtailrockfish and the <T3>Sebastes </T3>complex of rockfish, and are repeated at the end of this<T4>Federal Register </T4>notice. (3) There is no limit on the number of landings of widow rockfish under3,000 pounds. (4) Unless retention or landing of widow rockfish has been prohibited,a that has landed its weekly (or biweekly) limit may continue to fish onthe next week's (or two weeks') limit so long as the fish are not landed(offloaded) until the next legal one week (or two week) period.(5) The fishery management area for this species is the Exclusive EconomicZone (EEZ) off the coasts of Washington, Oregon, and California between3 and 200 nautical miles (nm) offshore, and bounded on the north by theProvisional International Boundary between the United States and Canada,and bounded on the south by the International Boundary between the UnitedStates and Mexico. However, all widow rockfish possessed 0-200 nm offshoreof, or landed in, Washington, Oregon or California are presumed to havebeen taken and retained from 0-200 nm offshore of Washington, Oregon, orCalifornia unless otherwise demonstrated by the person in possession ofthose fish. <ITAG tagnum="84">Sablefish </ITAG>Two major gear groups harvest sablefish off Washington, Oregon, and California.The nontrawl or fixed gear (predominantly pot and longline) fleet generallytargets on sablefish with little bycatch. The trawl fleet catches sablefishjointly with other species in its multispecies operations. Sablefish sometimesis the predominant species in a single trawl haul, but the extent of targetingis not known. The 1989 OY for sablefish is a range from 10,400 to 11,000 mt, and is higherthan the ABC of 9,000 mt. The OY was intended to gradually reduce the biomassover a 5-7 year period to the level that is expected to produce the maximumsustainable yield (MSY) of 8,200 mt with minimal disruption to the industry.At the November 1988 Council meeting, the GMT stated that, if no restrictionswere imposed in 1989, the harvest of sablefish could be at least as highas 24,500 mt, the highest landings on record, and more than 2.5 times theABC. Landings of this magnitude would bring the biomass below the levelthat would produce MSY in one year and would greatly increase the likelihoodof biological stress on the sablefish resource. To prevent biological stress, effective January 1, 1989 (54 FR 299, January5, 1989), the sablefish resource was allocated between the trawl and nontrawlfisheries, and trip limits were imposed in an attempt to stretch the trawlsablefish fishery throughout the year. These limits were intended to minimizethe fishing mortality above OY, and prevent discards and waste of sablefishunavoidably caught in the multispecies trawl fishery after the sablefishquota is reached. Twenty-two metric tons first were subtracted from 10,400mt (the low end of the OY range) to accommodate the expected harvest ofsablefish by the Makah Indian tribe. The remainder was allocated 5,397mt (52 percent) for the trawl fishery and 4,981 mt (48 percent) for thenontrawl fishery. A 600 mt buffer (the difference between the low and highends of the OY range) also was established to provide for uncertaintiesin landings projections and bycatch needs, and to allow small fisheriesto continue after the gear quotas are reached. Trip limits were recommendedfor both trawl and nontrawl fisheries to avoid reaching their respectivequotas before the end of the year. The trip limit for trawl-caught sablefishwas 1,000 pounds or 45 percent (by weight) of the deepwater complex, whicheveris greater. The deepwater complex consists of sablefish, Dover sole, thornyheads,and arrowtooth flounder. The Council also recommended extending the nontrawlseason by imposing a trip limit of 100 pounds when the quota is almostreached. This will allow nontrawl vessels to land small amounts of sablefishcaught incidentally while fishing for other species. At the April 3-7, 1989 meeting of the Council, the GMT advised that 780mt of sablefish had been landed by nontrawl gear through March 25, 1989.Based on observed and expected landing rates, the GMT projected that thenontrawl quota will be reached by June 27, 1989. For the most part, thenontrawl fishery has preferred early closure of its directed fishery ratherthan a prolonged season. Because it is a fairly selective target fishery,imposition of the 100 pound trip limit, or closure of the fishery, willnot result in large amounts of sablefish being unavoidably caught and discardedwhile fishing for other species. This is not the case for the multispecies trawl fishery. The GMT advisedthat 1,052 mt had been landed through March 25, 1989, and projected thatthe trawl quota would be reached on September 21, 1989. Even though landingsof sablefish would be prohibited when the trawl quota is reached, about2,000 mt of unavoidable catches of sablefish would continue to be takenin the multispecies trawl fishery. Although part of this 2,000 mt overagecould be accommodated by the 600 mt buffer (the difference between thelow and high ends of the OY range), about 1,400 mt would be harvested abovethe upper end of the OY range, discarded, and wasted. Therefore, prohibitingthe retention of sablefish when the trawl quota is reached, or even reducingthe sablefish trip limit without reducing the catch of the multispeciescomplex, is not likely to substantially reduce the fishing mortality ofsablefish. It would only result in the continuing catch and discard ofsablefish. The Council considered shortening the 5-7 year schedule forreaching MSY by increasing the OY, but it did not do so because the riskof overfishing would be increased. The subsequent abrupt reduction in fishinglevels when the MSY level of 8,200 mt was reached would be extremely disruptiveto the fishing industry. Consequently, the Council recommended the followingadjustments to the management measures currently in effect: (1) Decreasethe nontrawl quota by 400 mt; (2) increase the trawl quota by 1,000 mt(400 mt from the nontrawl quota and 600 mt from the buffer); (3) reducefishing on the deepwater complex as a whole in hope of a 1,000 mt decreasein the catch of sablefish; and (4) restrict the proportion of sablefishin landings of the deepwater complex.The Council's rationale for restricting the deepwater complex harvest relieson the best available scientific information, which indicates that sablefishare unavoidably caught while fishing for the complex. Thus, the Councilwas left with no realistic alternative to prevent the excessive harvest,discard, and waste of sablefish except to constrain the harvest of thecomplex itself. This is not unprecedented as, for example, landings ofthe <T3>Sebastes </T3>complex of rockfish have been reduced since 1983 to avoidoverfishing yellowtail rockfish. The Council recommended the following trawl trip limit on the deepwatercomplex. Only one landing above 4,000 pounds of the deepwater complex isallowed in a one-week period. That landing cannot exceed 30,000 poundsof the deepwater complex and cannot contain more than 25 percent sablefish.Biweekly and twice-weekly trip limit options are to be available, as forthe <T3>Sebastes </T3>complex of rockfish, so that 60,000 pounds of the deepwatercomplex may be landed once every two weeks, or 15,000 pounds of the deepwatercomplex may be landed twice in one week, if the proper state authoritiesare notified according to state laws and regulations (repeated at the endof this notice). There is no limit on the number of landings of the deepwatercomplex less than 4,000 pounds. However, if less than 4,000 pounds of thedeepwater complex is landed, the trip limit for sablefish is 1,000 pounds.The Council also recommended that the poundage and frequency limits onthe deep water complex be removed the last quarter of the year, but thetrip limit for sablefish remain at 1,000 pounds or 25 percent of the deepwatercomplex, whichever is greater. Accordingly, if the trawl allocation orOY has not been reached or is not imminent, the trip limits on the deepwatercomplex will be removed on October 4, 1989, incorporating the fishing weekwhich falls on the beginning of the fourth quarter. Because this specifictrip limit has never before been used, it is not certain whether trawllandings will be sufficiently reduced to avoid reaching the trawl quotain 1989. The trawl trip limit was derived primarily from the fish ticket data fromOregon and California for the second quarter of 1987 when no fishing restrictionswere in effect (except for sablefish smaller than 22 inches). These dataindicated that approximately 8 percent of the trawl trips containing thedeepwater complex were greater than 30,000 pounds. Therefore the trawltrip limit will eliminate the very large trips greater than 30,000 pounds.The 25 percent limit on sablefish is the approximate coastwide averageincidence of sablefish in a trip. Because the 25 percent limit is basedon an average, some discards of sablefish are likely to occur. There isno limit on the number of landings less than 4,000 pounds of the deepwatercomplex so that boats that have little or no sablefish on board are notunduly restricted. The 1,000 pound limit for sablefish is intended to allowsmall catches to be landed without encouraging targeting. Because the nontrawl quota is reduced by 400 mt, the nontrawl fishery willprobably close earlier than late June if current landing rates continue.However, a trip limit of 100 pounds will be imposed on a date to be determinedby the GMT when approximately 200 mt of the nontrawl allocation is remaining.This trip limit is intended to eliminate most target fishing and accommodatesmall fisheries that operate later in the year. The size limit for sablefishsmaller than 22 inches will no longer apply when the 100 pound trip limitis imposed. The GMT will monitor landings and recommend trip limit changes necessaryto meet the trawl and nontrawl quotas. Additional fishing restrictionsmay be imposed if needed to avoid exceeding these quotas, minimize discards,and provide for equitable use of the resource. If total landings reach 11,000 mt, the upper end of the OY range, all furtherlandings of sablefish will be prohibited. Accordingly, only the provisions announced in paragraphs 1, 3, 4 (a) and(b) at 53 FR 299 (January 5, 1989), and references to those paragraphs,are changed. The other provisions remain in effect, including the coastwidetrip limits for sablefish smaller than 22 inches (so that under the 25percent trawl trip limit, no more than 5,000 pounds may be sablefish smallerthan 22 inches, and under the 1,000 pound trip limit, all sablefish maybe smaller than 22 inches). Secretarial Action: The Secretary concurs with the Council's recommendationsand, pursuant to andSection; 663.22(a)(3), herein adjusts the managementmeasures at 50 CFR 663.27(b)(3) and at 53 FR 299 (January 5, 1989) as follows:(1) 1989 Management Goal. The sablefish fishery will be managed to achievethe OY range of 10,400-11,000 mt in 1989. If 11,000 mt (the upper end ofthe OY range) is reached, further landings of sablefish will be prohibiteduntil January 1, 1990. (2) Makah Tribal Fishery. Twenty-two metric tons is set aside for the MakahIndian tribe. This amount is not a quota and landings by the Makah tribalfishery will not be prohibited unless 11,000 mt of sablefish have beenlanded. (3) Gear Allocations. After 22 mt for the Makah Indian tribe is subtractedfrom 11,000 mt, the remaining 10,978 mt is allocated 6,397 mt for the trawlfishery and 4,581 mt for the nontrawl fishery. (4) Trip and Size Limits.(a) Trawl gear. (i) <T3>Weekly trip limit</T3>. Except for the biweekly and twice-weekly triplimits provided in paragraphs (4)(a)(ii) and (iii), no more than 30,000pounds of the deepwater complex (including no more than 1,000 pounds or25 percent of sablefish, whichever is greater) may be taken and retained,possessed, or landed, per vessel per fishing trip in a one-week period.``One-week period'' means seven consecutive days beginning 0001 hours Wednesdayand ending 2400 hours Tuesday, local time. Only one landing above 4,000pounds of the deepwater complex may be made per vessel in that one-weekperiod. There is no limit on the number of landings less than 4,000 poundsof the deepwater complex. (A) ``Deepwater complex'' means sablefish (<T3>Anoplopoma fimbria</T3>), Dover sole (<T3>Microstomus pacificus</T3>), thornyheads (<T3>Sebastolobus </T3>spp.), and arrowtooth flounder (<T3>Atheresthes stomias</T3>). (B) Percentages apply only to legal fish on board. Legal fish means groundfishtaken and retained, possessed, or landed in accordance with the provisionsof 50 CFR Part 663, the Magnuson Act, any notice issued under Subpart Bof Part 663, or any other regulation or permit promulgated under the MagnusonAct. (ii) <T3>Biweeklv trip limit option. </T3>If the fishery management agency ofthe state where the fish will be landed is notified as required by statelaw (WAC 220-44-050: OAR 635-04-033: CFandamp;GCA 7652), no more than 60,000pounds (round weight) of the deepwater complex (including no more than25 percent or 1,000 pounds of sablefish, whichever is greater) may be takenand retained, possessed, or landed per vessel per fishing trip in a two-weekperiod. After notification is given, and while it remains in effect, onlyone landing of the deepwater complex above 4,000 pounds (round weight)may be made per vessel in that two-week period. ``Two-week period'' means14 consecutive days beginning 0001 hours Wednesday and ending 2400 hoursTuesday, local time. Notification procedures for biweekly landings of thedeepwater complex are the same as for the <T3>Sebastes</T3> complex of rockfish, and are repeated at the end of this<T4>Federal Register </T4> notice. (iii) <T3>Twice-weekly trip limit option. </T3>If the fishery management agencyof the state where the fish will be landed is notified as required by statelaw (WAC 220-44-050: OAR 635-04-033: CFandamp;GCA 7652), no more than 15,000pounds (round weight) of the deepwater complex (including no more than25 percent or 1,000 pounds of sablefish, whichever is greater) may be takenand retained, possessed, or landed per vessel per fishing trip. After notificationis given, and while it remains in effect, only two landings of the deepwatercomplex above 4,000 pounds (round weight) may be made per vessel in thatone-week period. ``One-week period'' means seven consecutive days beginning0001 hours Wednesday and ending 2400 hours Tuesday, local time. Notificationprocedures for twice-weekly landings of the deepwater complex are the sameas for the <T3>Sebastes </T3>complex of rockfish, and are repeated at the end of this<T4>Federal Register </T4> notice.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Note: </T4>Twenty-five percent of the deepwater complex (includingsablefish) is equivalent to 33.333 percent of all  legal fish on boardin the deepwater complex other than sablefish.</ITAG>(iv) Of those sablefish taken with trawl gear under paragraphs (4)(a)(i),(ii), and (iii) above, no more than 5,000 pounds of sablefish smaller than22 inches (total length) may be taken and retained, possessed, or landedper vessel per fishing trip. (v) If the trawl quota or OY has not been reached or is not imminent, theoverall poundage and trip frequency limits for the deepwater complex willbe removed on October 4, 1989. As a result, the trip frequency limit forsablefish also will be removed, and weekly, biweekly, and twice-weeklytrip limits will no longer apply. However, the trip limit on sablefishin paragraph 4(a)(1) (1,000 pounds or 25 percent of the deepwater complex,whichever is greater, per vessel per trip), and the size limit in paragraph4(a)(iv) (which specifies that no more than 5,000 pounds of the sablefishtaken under paragraph 4(a)(1) may be smaller than 22 inches) and all otherprovisions announced in this notice and pertaining to sablefish will remainin effect until modified, superseded, or rescinded. (b) Nontrawl gear. (i) A trip limit of 100 pounds will be imposed when approximately 200 mtof the nontrawl allocation is remaining. This trip limit will be announcedin a separate <T4>Federal Register </T4> notice.(ii) For sablefish smaller than 22 inches (total length) caught with nontrawlgear, no more than 1,500 pounds or three percent (by weight) of all legalsablefish on board, whichever is greater, may be taken and retained, possessed,or landed per vessel per fishing trip. For processed (``headed'') sablefish,see paragraph (d). (c) Total length is measured from the tip of the snout (mouth closed) tothe tip of the tail (pinched together) without mutilation of the fish orthe use of additional force to extend the length of the fish. (d) For processed (``headed'') sablefish, (i) The minimum size limit is 15.5 inches measured from the origin of thefirst dorsal fin (where the front dorsal fin meets the dorsal surface ofthe body closest to the head) to the tip of the upper lobe of the tail;the dorsal fin and tail must be left intact; and, (ii) The product recovery ratio (PRR) established by  the state where thefish is or will be landed is used to convert the processed weight to roundweight for purposes of applying the trip limit.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Note: </T4>The Federal trip limit for processed (``headed'') sablefishis based on the product recovery ratios (PRRs) used by Washington, Oregon,or California, as in the past. It should be noted that the state PRRs maydiffer and fishermen should contact fishery enforcement officials in thestate where the fish will be landed to determine that state's officialPRR.</ITAG>(e) No sablefish may be retained which is in such condition that its lengthhas been extended or cannot be determined by the methods stated above.(5) The fishery management area for these species is the EEZ off the coastsof Washington, Oregon, and California between 3 and 200 nm offshore, andbounded on the north by the Provisional International Boundary betweenthe United States and Canada, and bounded on the south by the InternationalBoundary between the United States and Mexico. However, all fish in thedeepwater complex possessed 0-200 nm offshore of, or landed in, Washington,Oregon, or California are presumed to have been taken and retained from0-200 nm offshore of Washington, Oregon, or California unless otherwisedemonstrated by the person in possession of those fish. (6) Pursuant to andSection; 663.22(a)(3), the regulations at andSection; 663.27(b)(3)are adjusted until further notice. (7) Nontrawl (fixed) gear includes set nets (gill and trammel nets), trapsor pots, longlines, commercial vertical hook-and-line gear, troll gear.(8) Trawl gear includes bottom trawls, roller or bobbin trawls, pelagictrawls, and shrimp trawls. (9) All weights and percentages of fish on board are based on round weights.If sablefish are processed, refer to paragraph (4)(d) for conversion toround weight. <ITAG tagnum="84">Notifications for Biweekly and Twice-Weekly Trip Limit Options </ITAG>Notifications for biweekly and twice-weekly trip limit options for the<T3>Sebastes </T3>complex of rockfish and yellowtail rockfish already arein effect, as required by state law.

The notificationprocedures in this <T4>Federal Register </T4>notice for biweekly and twice-weekly trip limitoptions are the same as those already in effect for landings of the <T3>Sebastes </T3>complex and yellowtail rockfish. Section 663.23 of the groundfish regulations states that the Secretarywill publish a notice of action reducing fishing levels in proposed formunless he determines that prior notice and public review are impracticable,unnecessary, or contrary to public interest. Section 663.23 also statesthat any notice issued under this section will not be effective until 30days after publication in the <T4>Federal Register, </T4>unless the Secretary finds and publishes withthe notice good cause for an earlier effective date. If unrestricted, catchesunquestionably will exceed the OYs for widow rockfish and sablefish in1989, increasing the likelihood of biological stress on those stocks. Promptaction to limit these fishing rates is necessary to protect the widow rockfishand sablefish stocks and alleviate the necessity for fishery closures beforethe end of 1989. Fishing rates are higher than expected at the beginningof the year. Delay in implementation of these actions most likely wouldresult in an even more accelerated rate of landings by fishermen anticipatingmore restrictive limits. If landings are substantially increased, the projectionsmade by the GMT will not be valid and the management measures set forthin this notice will not adequately slow the fishery. As a result, additional,more restrictive measures would need to be imposed. Consequently, furtherdelay of these actions is impracticable and contrary to the public interest,and these actions are taken in final form effective April 26, 1989. The public has had opportunity to comment on these management measures.The public participated in the Groundfish Select Group, GMT, GroundfishAdvisory Subpanel, and Council meetings in March and April 1989 that generatedthe management actions endorsed by the Council and the Secretary. Furtherpublic comments will be accepted for 15 days after publication of thisnotice in the <T4>Federal Register. </T4><ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 50 CFR Part 663 </ITAG>Administrative practice and procedure, Fisheries, Fishing, Foreign relations.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority: </T4>16 U.S.C. 1801 <T3>et seq.</T3> </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: April 26, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Joe P.
