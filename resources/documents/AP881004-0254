Gil told a news conference the current ``price war'' could bringprices down temporarily to two-year lows of below $10 a barrel.   ``We are arriving at (price) levels of 1986...Undoubtedly thiswill compromise the payment of the debt,'' Gil said.   He said any decision regarding debt payments would be made bythe Finance Ministry.   ``I do not know what price level Venezuela can bear,'' Gil said.   When oil prices fell in 1986, Venezuela called forrenegotiations on its $35 billion foreign debt and stopped makingprincipal payments on its $20.34 billion of refinanced public debtwhile talks were held.   ``Perhaps prices will reach a level we haven't seen in twoyears. This could be encouraging for (OPEC) to arrive at anagreement'' on curbing output, he said.   He said Saudi Arabia warned other OPEC members of its decisionto force prices down during the Sept.25-26 meeting in Madrid ofOPEC's price monitoring committee.   ``We understand Saudi Arabia's desire to bring discipline to themarket through shock treatment but the affects do not please us.''   He said a joint meeting in the third week of October of OPEC'slong-term strategy committee and the price committee is likely tolast longer than the meeting of the price committee alone.   ``There are more countries and more matters to discuss,'' hesaid. He said the site of the meeting has not yet been decided.</TEXT></DOC>
