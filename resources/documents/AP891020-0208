Relief officials worried that the aid, though widespread, wasn'tenough to fill the needs of what by some estimates could be themost expensive natural disaster in U.S. history.   ``What we need is cash,'' said Laurie Levy, spokesperson for theRed Cross chapter in San Francisco, which was routing donations offood, clothing, blankets and other goods to the Salvation Army andother aid groups.   Red Cross officials said most donations were welcome but somewere ill-considered in the immediate wake of the disaster. Onecompany, for example, volunteered caseloads of rarely used D-sizebatteries. In Lansing, Mich., the Michigan Chiropractic Societyoffered its services.   ``At least in the first seven days we have to be handlingpeople's absolute basic life needs: food, clothing and shelter,''said Chris Garrett, public information director for the Red Crossin San Francisco.   ``We need toilet paper, plastic spoons and paper plates andthose kinds of things,'' she said. Computers and fax machines werealso being sought to enable the agency to compile lists of thedead, injured and homeless, Ms. Garrett said.   ``Every country in the world is calling for information,'' shesaid.   But the most urgent requirement was for money to help relocatehomeless families from shelters to temporary living quarters suchas hotels, Ms. Levy said. As of Friday morning, 5,000 people werehoused in 30 shelters in the region affected by Tuesday's quake,the Red Cross said.   Overall, an estimated 12,550 people were displaced, according tothe state Office of Emergency Services.   Offers of money came from several multinational corporations,some with long-term ties to the Bay area, as well as smallerpockets. In Bloomington, Ind., two radio stations raised $40,120 inan all-day pledge-a-thon. A Tucson, Ariz, hairstylist announced shewould hold a cut-a-thon Sunday and donate the $5-a-head proceeds.   Perhaps the biggest private donation came Friday from the LosAngeles-based Ralph M. Parsons foundation, funded by the estate ofthe late engineer, which gave $1 million _ $750,000 to the RedCross and $250,000 to the Salvation Army.   As of Friday, about $7 million had been pledged to the Red Crossalone, Ms. Garrett said.   Japan's Sony Corp. and its subsidiary, Sony Corp. of America,offered $1 million in aid.   ``We share the shock and grief of those who have suffered as a aresult of the earthquake,'' said Neil Vander Dussen, president ofthe Park Ridge, N.J.-based subsidiary.   Another Japanese giant, Mitsubishi Bank Ltd., which owns the SanFrancisco-based Bank of California, said it would give $300,000 tothe Red Cross and $100,000 each to the police and fire departmentsof San Francisco and Oakland.   San Francisco-based Wells Fargo Bank announced a $1 milliongrant program to help communities rebuild. The bank also planned togive a $250,000 grant to the Red Cross.   Ford Motor Co. said it was donating $300,000 to the Red Crossand $200,000 to the Santa Clara County United Way, and GeneralMotors offered $500,000 to the Red Cross. Procter andamp; Gambleannounced it had donated food and other products valued at morethan $300,000.   Many people, however, simply loaned a hand. The Red Cross hasbeen deluged with 5,000 volunteers, Ms. Garrett said. Indeed, for atime there were more volunteers than homeless.   ``The ironic thing is that yesterday we had more people comingin to volunteer than we had a need for'' she said, adding thatofficials were concerned that ``as soon as the thrill is gone, thevolunteers will disappear.''   ``For a month, we'll have a huge need for volunteers,'' she said.   The Soviet government, offering a return favor for the millionsof dollars and thousands of foreign rescuers and doctors thatpoured into Armenia after December's earthquake, volunteered tosend doctors, geologists and rescue workers to San Francisco, Tassreported Friday.   Red Cross officials, noting that Thursday was the one-monthanniversary of Hurricane Hugo's assault on South Carolina, said thequake would be a crushing burden to what what was already thehighest-ever relief bill in the organization's 108-year history.   ``In 1906, the Red Cross spent $9 million on earthquake reliefin San Francisco. There's 50 times more population now and a widerarea affected. Just with inflation alone you can begin to conjureup astronomical figures,'' said Ms. Garrett.   With damage estimates already at more than $5.5 billion, theearthquake was the most expensive natural disaster in U.S. historywith the possible exception of the 1906 quake, according to theIndependent Insurance Agents of America, a trade group based inWashington.   The 1906 devastation cost up to $5.8 billion in current dollars,said Becky Newman, a spokeswoman for the group. A privateeconomist, Frank McCormick of Bank of America in San Francisco,said damage from Tuesday's quake is likely to reach $10 billion.</TEXT></DOC>
