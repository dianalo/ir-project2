Sudden tightness in the supply of North Sea Brent crude for May delivery and optimism about an expected seasonal rise in gasoline demand partly fueled the recent advance, analysts said. They added that the rally also reflects growing belief that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries has done a credible job of restraining output, suggesting that the oil cartel may well become an even stronger factor in oil prices in the near future.    At the New York Merc, crude oil for June delivery rose 13 cents a barrel to $19.05. Yesterday was the first time since the contract started trading that its price exceeded $19, the exchange said.    June heating oil rose 0.28 cent a gallon to 49.77 cents. June gasoline rose 0.31 cent a gallon to 52.53 cents.    William O'Neill, research director at Elders Futures Inc., traced the strength in crude oil back to April 21, when contracts for May delivery expired on a strong note.    &quot;Prior to the May expiration, prices were kind of shaky and dropping down to near the $18 mark,&quot; Mr. O'Neill said. &quot;But strong short covering developed&quot; and the price expired at $19.03 a barrel, he noted. Short covering is the purchase of contracts to offset those sold earlier.    Since the May expiration, the trend in prices has been &quot;almost straight up,&quot; Mr. O'Neill said.    On Monday, increased demand developed for May Brent crude in Europe, analysts said. This caused London futures to firm, and yesterday New York futures prices advanced from the opening.    Mr. O'Neill characterized the Brent situation as a temporary supply shortage. &quot;Buyers have been reluctant to follow the price higher as it rose recently,&quot; he said. But now &quot;they have to buy.&quot;    There was some difference of opinion among analysts about whether holders of Brent oil were reluctant to sell or whether the aggressiveness of the buyers was the primary spur for prices.    There was speculation among analysts yesterday about what OPEC may do in the near future to strengthen its position. Some recalled recent remarks of the Nigerian oil minister, who is president of OPEC. The minister said he expected higher prices this quarter and, particularly, in the third and fourth quarters.    Analysts recalled that the minister cited two courses of action OPEC could take: It could maintain the current production rate and raise the official price to $19 or $20 a barrel, or it could produce more oil and hold prices at current level.    Nauman Barakat, an analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham andamp; Co. in New York, said &quot;there is concern that OPEC will raise the price when it meets again on June 25.&quot;    In other futures markets yesterday:    STOCK INDEXES: Prices surged, boosted by the dollar's strength and a recovery in bond and bond futures prices. There was &quot;good, steady buying&quot; throughout the session, said J.R. Fredericks, an analyst at E. David Stephens Commodity Corp. in Chicago. Stock-index futures also benefited from hopes for an arms limitation agreement between the U.S. and Soviet Union, Mr. Fredericks said. At the Chicago Board of Trade, the Major Market Index for May delivery opened at a strong premium above the cash index, said Gerald J. Walsh, stock-index futures analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. in New York. The difference triggered arbitrage programs to sell the futures and buy stocks that make up the Major Market Index of 20 blue-chip issues, Mr. Walsh said. In addition, buyers of those stocks were aiming for dividend payments due in the coming days, he said. The blue-chip buying helped lift the Dow Jones Industrial Average 51.85 points to 2338.07. Meanwhile, on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the Standard andamp; Poor's 500-stock index for June delivery rose 4.60 to 296.30. The close above 295 was &quot;very constructive&quot; from a technician's point of view, Mr. Walsh said.    PRECIOUS METALS: Gold and silver prices dropped but finished above their intraday lows in a turbulent, abbreviated trading session at the Commodity Exchange in New York. Initially, prices fell sharply in response to the dollar's rally. They recovered because of underlying strength tied to demand for gold and silver bullion in cash markets, analysts said. At the Comex, July silver traded as high as $9.07 an ounce and as low as $8 before settling at $8.40 for a decline of 36 cents. The trading range for June gold was tighter, with the intraday high at $467 an ounce and the low at $456. The June contract settled at $460.80, down $4.40. Daily limits on price moves had been removed from the July silver and the June gold contracts, contributing to the volatility, analysts said. Silver remained under liquidation pressure, analysts said. They noted that open interest, or contracts outstanding, declined 3,228 contracts from Friday's close to Monday's close, when the total open interest for all contracts stood at 102,492. In gold, open interest overall rose 4,829 contracts, to 176,843 at Monday's close. That suggested that gold was benefiting from growing investor interest, analysts said.    GRAINS AND SOYBEANS: Soybean prices plummeted as foreign currencies and precious metals declined. The weakness in those markets also put pressure on most grain futures. Soybeans also were hurt by word of good harvesting weather in Brazil. Corn was mixed, with contracts for delivery after the harvest down slightly. News that 48% of this year's corn planting was completed as of Sunday may give the market a slightly bearish tone, analysts said. Wheat also was mixed. </TEXT></DOC>
