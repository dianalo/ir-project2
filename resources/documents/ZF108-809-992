(EPR) is the primary technical arm of ExxonCorp. responsible for providing Exxon producing affiliates with thetechnology needed to explore for and produce oil, gas, and otherhydrocardons.andM;The National Institute of Health (NIH), a federal government agency, is thelargest biomedical research institution in the United States and one of theworld's foremost centers of medical research.andP;  NIH's Division of ComputerResearch and Technology provides computing research and services in supportof the agency's biomedical research mission.andM;Princeton is a private research university that emphasizes education in thearts and sciences.andP;  Chartered in 1746 as the College of New Jersey, Princetonnow enrolls 4,500 undergraduate and 1,700 graduate students.andP;  Princeton'sfaculty of 800 includes four Nobel Laureates and 12 MacArthur Fellows.andM;The Royal Signals and Radar Establishment (RSRE) is a research organizationtasked with providing the United Kingdom Ministry of Defense with expertisein a wide variety of technologies.andP;  These include electronic systems, largesystem integration, communications and computer hardware and softwareengineering.andP;  Staffed with approximately 1,000 scientists and engineers, RSREhas a long history of achievement in compiler and operating system technologyand in language design.andM;Software Research Associates is one of the oldest and largest independentdevelopers of UNIX-based software in Japan.andP;  Primary operations includesystems integration, facility management service, and contracted systemdevelopment.andM;The Superconducting Super Collider Laboratory, located in Dallas, Texas,conducts research into the fundamental nature of matter and energy, using theworld's largest scientific instrument, a 20 million electron volt subatomicparticle accelerator.andP;  The Laboratory also serves as a national resource forscience education.andM;The University of Alaska Fairbanks (UAF) is a land-grant college establishedin 1917.andP;  According to Thomas Hassler, director of the University'sAdministrative Computing Department, &quot;UAF has a philosophical commitment toopen systems.andM;&quot;To give life to this commitment, we joined OSF to participate in thedefinition and development of the tools we will use in the future.andP;  We areanxiously awaiting OSF/1 ...,&quot; Hassler continued.andM;The University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory has existed as a departmentdevoted to computing since 1937.andP;  It has been active in the development ofdigital equipment since 1946.andP;  The Laboratory issues undergraduate degrees inComputer Science, and does research in distributed systems andcommunications, hardware verification, automated reasoning, and naturallanguage processing.andP;  There are approximately 80 Ph.D students working inthese and other areas.andM;The Open Software Foundation is a non-profit research and developmentorganization developing and delivering an open software environment based onstandards for the benefit of the information processing industry.andP;  OSF usesan innovative open process, soliciting technologies from theindustry-at-large and invites member participation in setting technicaldirection for the Foundation's efforts.andP;  The OSF is headquartered inCambridge, MA.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
