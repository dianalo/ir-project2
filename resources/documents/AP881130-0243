The unit, Hartford Fire Insurance Co., filed suit Tuesday in U.S.District Court in Manhattan against Campeau and Federated DepartmentStores, which Campeau acquired for $6.6 billion in April.   The suit accuses Federated of securities fraud involving a $200million bond issue in October 1987. Federated officials knew theircompany was a possible takeover target, and failed to disclose thatthey could approve transactions such as a buyout that would reducethe credit rating _ and thus the market value _ of those bonds, thesuit alleged.   Campeau borrowed heavily to acquire Federated, causingbond-rating agencies to downgrade the bonds issued earlier byFederated.   Hartford Fire sold Federated bonds after the downgrading,suffering a $4.3 million loss, the suit stated. The company isseeking compensatory damages plus interest.   In takeovers financed mainly with debt _ transactions known asleveraged buyouts _ the target company is left with a huge debt loadthat is repaid with its cash flow or with money raised by the saleof its assets.   Because the huge new debt payments increase the risk that thecompany will not be able to meet all its previous obligations, suchbuyouts generally reduce the credit rating for the target's bonds.   A Campeau spokeswoman told the New York Times in today's editionsthat the Toronto-based company had no comment because it had notseen the suit.   ITT's insurance subsidiaries on Nov. 14 sued RJR Nabisco Corp. infederal court, alleging fraud because Nabisco management did notdisclose the possibility of undertaking a leveraged buyout when itsold them bonds earlier this year.   The suit contends that possibility should have been stated in thebond prospectus because it was likely to depress RJR Nabisco'scorporate debt rating and therefore decrease the price of the bonds.   RJR Nabisco management last month kicked off amultibillion-dollar bidding war for the company by making aleveraged buyout proposal. RJR's bonds have dropped sharply in valuesince the bidding began.   Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. also has sued RJR Nabisco,claiming the value of its RJR bonds had dropped by nearly $40million.</TEXT></DOC>
