Sherry Rowland, one of the scientists who discovered the dangersof compounds known as chlorofluorocarbons, said it would takecenturies to repair the shield that filters the sun's cancer-causingultraviolet rays.   ``Even if we had a total ban tomorrow, and there were no furtheremissions, we would expect things to get worse until about the endof the century, and then gradually recover over two centuries,''said Rowland, professor of atmospheric chemistry at the Universityof California at Irvine.   Rowland's comments came during a 120-nation ozone conference thatbegan Sunday.   Rowland told reporters many of the compounds already released inthe atmosphere have not reached the stratosphere, 15-25 miles abovethe earth. At that altitude, they are broken apart and the liberatedchlorine atoms destroy the ozone.   The compounds also trap heat in the atmosphere and contribute tothe greenhouse effect, which could cause major climatic changes,scientists say.   Some of the compounds can last as long as 100 years. They arewidely used in aerosols, refrigeration, air conditioning andfast-food packaging.   Chlorine levels in the atmosphere would not return to the levelsof the 1960s until the 22nd or 23rd century, Rowland said.   Robert Watson of NASA agreed ``it will take many many decades,possibly even several centuries'' to restore the ozone layer.   Soviet delegate Vladimir Zhakarov said the timetable foreliminating cholorofluorocarbons should ``not be on the basis ofemotions.''   Zhakarov also said Soviet data indicated the ozone layer overparts of Europe and the western Soviet Union had been depleted by upto 25 percent in winter, but that it was partly due to naturalcauses.   ``This depletion occurs every 10 to 15 days,'' he said. ``Itmoves from west to east. It coincides with the movement of cyclonesduring this time.''   President Daniel arap Moi of Kenya, who opened the conference,said all countries had an obligation to protect the atmosphere, butthat developing countries would need help from the industrialnations.   Moi urged all countries that have not yet signed the 1987Montreal Protocol _ calling for the compound emissions to be halvedby the year 2000 _ to ``join us in the endeavor to protect ourplanet.''   Britain's environment secretary, Nicholas Ridley, told theconference six more countries _ Austria, Hungary, the Malaysia, thePhilippines, Trinidad and Zambia _ agreed to join the 40 that havesigned it.   Some countries have gone further, including the United States,which plans to eliminate all chlorofluorocarbons and similarcompounds known as halons by 1999.   The 12-member European Economic Community agreed to a similartarget last week, and Commissioner Ripa Di Meana told the conferencehe hoped for a total European ban ``well before the end of thecentury ...''   William Reilly, head of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency,said whether that target is possible ``remains to be seen'' anddepends largely on how soon alternatives can be developed.   Archie Dunham, a vice president for the Du Pont chemical company,said it hopes to begin selling chlorofluorocarbon alternatives bythe mid-1990s.   ``There is no single compound that has the complete range ofproperties offered by the (chlorofluorocarbon) it is targeted toreplace,'' Dunham said. ``All will represent a compromise, whetherit be in flammability, toxicity, energy efficiency, suitability forexisting equipment or performance in use.''   Reilly said he brought with him a letter from President Bush toPrime Minister Margaret Thatcher saying ``the United States attachesthe highest priority to the international environment.''   Mrs. Thatcher said countries which produce and use the compounds``have a heavier responsibility than others'' to resolve the problem.   The United States is the leading producer of the compounds,followed by Western Europe and Japan.   In Dhaka, Bangladesh, President Hussain Muhammad Ershad opened aconference on the greenhouse effect, saying his country could suffermost from global warming because most of the population lives inflood-prone regions.   R.M. Stewart, a Canadian scientist presenting the conference'smain report, said recent research showed higher temperaturesincrease water vapor, which could lead to heavier rainfall.</TEXT></DOC>
