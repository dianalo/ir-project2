Tutu, winner of the 1984 Nobel Peace Prize, was arrested alongwith his wife and 34 other protesters as they marched outside St.George's Cathedral to protest the alleged beating of church workersby police earlier in the day.   Tutu and the others were released several hours later.   ``We are going to defy until freedom comes,'' Tutu told severalhundred supporters after his release. ``I'm increasingly proud ofbeing part of a community that has decided we have had enough.''   Police spokesman Brig. Leon Mellet said all 36 could faceprosecution under a law that prohibits demonstrations nearParliament. The march took place about 200 yards from Parliament.   Police also threatened Friday to take ``decisive action'' againstmembers of the media who defy state-of-emergency regulations thatprohibit reporting on unrest.   About 20 protesters from the Western Province Council of Churchessaid police used batons and whips Friday to chase them from asecurity police office in Cape Town, where they had gone to condemnrecent detentions of activists.   Tutu described the beatings as ``utterly, utterly scandalous. Itwas a peaceful demonstration.''   Later, when Tutu and the other activists left St. George's, whichTutu heads, they encountered police who formed a human barricade.Police told the demonstrators to disperse, then led them into vanswhen they refused.   In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwilersaid the United States had made its concern known to the SouthAfrican government and has asked for a full report on the incident.   ``Once again, we urge the South African government to permit thepeaceful expression of political dissent,'' she said.   Canon Winston Ndungane, chief executive officer of AnglicanChurch in South Africa, called Tutu's arrest ``a further indicationthat the authorities will use whatever means possible to prevent aman of peace going about his work.''   ``When (Tutu's) peaceful intervention is met by this kind ofbehavior, it lessens whatever hope we have of ending the conflict inthis country,'' Ndungane said.   Tutu's wife, Leah, was among about 200 women arrested Wednesdayin Cape Town for staging an unauthorized protest. The women werereleased without bail and told to appear in court next month.   Tutu, the first black to lead the Anglican Church in southernAfrica, has played a prominent role in the nationwide defiancecampaign launched Aug. 2. The campaign is aimed at challengingsegregation laws and mobilizing opposition to the Sept. 6parliamentary elections, which exclude the 28-million black majority.   On Saturday, activists planned an illegal protest march onParliament and also planned to defy a police ban by holding a hugerally in Soweto, the township outside Johannesburg. On Sunday,blacks have scheduled a mass picnic on a whites-only beach in theIndian Ocean city of Durban.   Police have arrested or detained scores of activists in the pastweek, and more were reported Friday in cities nationwide.   Several blocks from the site of Tutu's march, police arrestedmore than 100 college and university teachers for staging an illegalanti-government protest on a pedestrian mall.   In Durban, police arrested about 300 students, both black andwhite, who were demonstrating just outside the University of Natalcampus.   On Cape Town's outskirts, where police and militant youths haveclashed daily for several weeks, several mixed-race studentsreportedly were wounded when officers fired tear gas and birdshot todisperse a protest rally.   Police said they were ``deeply concerned about the screeningabroad of film material featuring scenes of unrest.''   ``Police hereby issue an early warning to the media to strictlycomply with all media emergency regulations,'' a statement said.   Under the 3-year-old state of emergency, reporting on policeaction and unrest is prohibited without permission from authorities.   The restrictions have not been enforced comprehensively, butphotographers and television cameramen have had their filmconfiscated by police with increasing frequency in recent weeks.   Thousands of black union members, meanwhile, joined the defiancecampaign Friday, staging work stoppages at their factories toprotest a labor law they say cripples their power to strike.   One of the biggest union protests was at the Unilever Ltd.factory in Boksburg, east of Johannesburg, where about 1,000 workersmarched around the premises, many carrying placards denouncing theyear-old Labor Relations Amendment Act.   The two main black labor federations have joined other majoranti-apartheid groups in calling for a national protest next Tuesdayand Wednesday against the elections. In the past, such protests havetaken the form of a general strike.   The labor relations act has been the subject of a bitter disputeamong the government, employers and unions since it was drafted bygovernment officials last year.   Employers agreed to some changes after unions complained it wouldvirtually eliminate their ability to strike. But several provisionsremain which they unions say are unacceptable, including aprohibition on sympathy strikes by workers not directly involved ina contract dispute.   Friday's protest was endorsed by the 1 million-member Congress ofSouth African Trade Unions and by the 500,000-member NationalCouncil of Trade Unions.</TEXT></DOC>
