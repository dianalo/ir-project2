The loss was considerably narrower than Meritor's $79.4 million second-quarter loss, which resulted from a charge to beef up loan-loss reserves, cover additional restructuring costs and write down some real-estate investment properties.    For the 1987 third quarter, Meritor recorded a huge $379.6 million loss, after a write-down of good will stemming from its 1982 purchase of Western Savings Bank.    More recently, Meritor has suffered from generally rising interest rates and the continuing costs of carrying some ill-fated interest-rate swap agreements. With rates moving higher in the third quarter, Meritor's return on mortgages and investments fell as its cost of funds moved up, which reduced its net interest income, analysts and bank officials said.    Meritor took on some rate swap agreements in late 1984 as a hedge against higher rates. Despite the upward movement in the past quarter, rates today are much lower than they were then, so the rate swaps have turned out to be a very costly insurance policy for the thrift. On an annualized basis, the carrying cost for the rate swaps was about $10 million in the third quarter, said Harold L. Connell, Meritor's chief financial officer.    The thrift is in the midst of a vast restructuring program aimed at returning it to profitability and shrinking its asset base. About $2 billion of assets have been put up for sale, including most of its mortgage, real-estate development and consumer-credit businesses. While no decision has been made to sell Meritor's savings bank units in Florida and Washington, D.C., seven small branches in Lehigh and Berks counties in eastern Pennsylvania are also on the block.    No major assets sales were completed in the third quarter, but Meritor booked gains of over $2 million, mostly from the sale of Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. preferred stock.    Such a small gain &quot;shows {Meritor's management} isn't playing any games with the income statement,&quot; said James Benson, a thrift analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. He noted that in the past, Meritor and other thrifts have sold assets just to dress up their income statements. He believes although Meritor wants to shrink the bank's asset base, management &quot;isn't that concerned with the short-term. They're managing the company for the long term.&quot;    In the first nine months, the thrift had a loss of $92.1 million, compared with $360.2 million a year earlier.    In the third quarter, nonperforming assets dropped to 1.3% of total assets from 2.2% at 1987 year end. Non-interest expenses also declined, showing management's resolve to improve the bank's profitability, analysts said. </TEXT></DOC>
