The new so-called short form, which will contain an abbreviated version of the worksheet that had been provided to calculate withholding allowances, likely won't be usable by all taxpayers. IRS Commissioner Lawrence Gibbs has cautioned that more affluent people and those with relatively more complicated tax situations probably will still have to fill out the longer version.    The simpler W-4, which is less precise than the current form, is expected to be biased toward overwithholding. That means people who use it will have too much taken out of their paychecks and will be owed refunds at the end of the year. Taxpayers who want a more accurate result may use the earlier form, but all employees must fill out one or the other.    IRS officials said the new, simplified form has been extensively tested by computer and that focus groups were used to gauge public reaction. The form released last November was tested only on employees in two IRS service centers.    The agency began working on a simplified W-4 in January after being ordered to do so by Treasury Secretary James Baker. His action came in the face of a torrent of complaints by members of Congress and the public over the earlier version, which was needed to adjust withholding to reflect the new tax law. </TEXT></DOC>
