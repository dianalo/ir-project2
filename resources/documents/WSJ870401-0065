With the price of chips rising on the current surge in demand, the U.S. is becoming less likely to impose lasting sanctions on consumer products made by Japanese semiconductor makers, according to some U.S. chip makers. The sanctions are set to take effect April 17.    The recent rash of chip ordering began about three weeks ago when the Japanese government said it was taking stern measures to force Japanese companies to comply with the U.S.-Japan Semiconductor Trade Agreement, including a directive to Japanese chip makers to cut production.    &quot;All I can say is that things are starting to work,&quot; said Jim Garrett, vice president of sales and marketing for Boise, Idaho-based Micron Technology Inc., one of the U.S. chip industry's most outspoken critics of Japanese trade practices.    Evidently, U.S. chip users took recent Tokyo initiatives to raise chip prices more seriously than the Reagan administration, which last week decided to impose stiff tariffs on Japan for allegedly underpricing chips in violation of the chip accord, undeterred by late Japanese moves to comply.    For now, U.S. semiconductor industry executives say, the Japanese are complying with the anti-dumping part of the trade accord. It is the first time that angry U.S. semiconductor industry executives have conceded Japanese compliance since the accord was signed last summer. The Japanese, however, still must find ways to increase U.S. chip makers' share in Japan, the other part of the trade agreement.    In addition to appeasing U.S. critics, Japan's production cutbacks, by driving up prices for chips, may make Japanese companies competitive again in the U.S. market. Since the pact's inception, most Japanese chip makers have been priced out of the U.S. market by the Commerce Department's so-called fair-market values -- the prices set quarterly for certain Japanese -- made chips below which the producers are forbidden to sell the goods under the chip agreement.    For example, orders for the staple 256-kilobit dynamic random access memory chips, known as DRAMs, are running so high that Japanese producers based in the U.S. are afraid they won't be able to meet demand. Executives who work for Japanese chip firms in this country say Japan's powerful Ministry of International Trade and Industry, or MITI, has been holding up export licenses to dry up excess inventories, which often are sold on the so-called gray market, while also directing Japanese producers to cut their output about one-third from the production levels in effect last December.    &quot;Orders started coming back three weeks ago, but now we can't get parts because of MITI,&quot; said a disgruntled U.S. executive of a Japanese chip maker.    Mr. Garrett of Micron has been receiving &quot;near-panic calls&quot; from customers seeking to book long-term supply contracts with the chip maker. For example, one customer, which until recently had ordered chips from Micron in 40-day intervals, just placed an order with the company to supply it with chips through next year. These longer-term orders are carrying higher price tags: Micron's 256K DRAM prices have risen about 25% in the past three weeks, according to Mr. Garrett.    Moreover, the company's lead times -- the interval from booking to delivery -- have lengthened during the recent demand surge, from about three weeks one month ago to roughly seven weeks today.    &quot;Companies are jockeying for supplies because there's a feeling they might get left behind in this DRAM deal,&quot; Mr. Garrett said.    The current turmoil in the chip market is similar to what happened last August, when the announcement of the semiconductor trade agreement sent prices soaring. At that time Japan's chip makers essentially stopped selling their products through normal distribution channels in the U.S. altogether, after the Commerce Department established the high fair-market value for chips.    At the time, U.S. chip makers were pleased with the impact of the trade pact. But as low-cost Japanese DRAMs dried up in the U.S., they proliferated in Asian markets, arousing intense industry concern, continued charges of Japanese dumping and ultimately the U.S. sanctions announced last week. Mr. Garrett, invoking last summer's experience, urged U.S. officials not to waiver in their resolve to impose sanctions.    &quot;If we show more weakness,&quot; he said, &quot;I fear they'll just dump again some place else in another few months.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
