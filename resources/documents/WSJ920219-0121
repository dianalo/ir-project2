But it isclear that Mr. Bush hasn't grasped the full extent to whichregulation has added to the burden that taxes impose on theeconomy. Regulation's effect on the economy can be every bitas damaging as the effect of taxes. Even though Americanshave not seen it in their pay stubs, they have borne theequivalent of growing tax burdens. And tax burdens haveclimbed as dramatically during his watch as they have underany other president.   The table shows the combined tax and regulatory burdenthat has been placed on American businesses and workers inrecent years. The numbers refer only to increases over andabove whatever was imposed the previous year. For example, anew tax of $25 billion in year one that continues to bring in$25 billion each year thereafter is listed as $25 billion inyear one and nothing thereafter. Only if the tax is increasedabove its initial level is the increase presented in asubsequent year.</LP><TEXT>   In a few cases, Congress and the administration havedecided to hide the true burden of government programs byordering businesses to spend the necessary money to complywith certain edicts. But ordering companies to spend $25billion to fulfill a public need does not mean that thepublic has avoided a $25 billion tax. Businesses today earnonly 4 cents in profit for every dollar of sales. When abusinessman receives the bill for a mandated benefit, thebusiness must reorganize its operations in order to survive.This often means layoffs, plants closing and othercost-cutting moves. Companies that are not able to cut costssufficiently to pay for the additional burdens are forced toclose entirely.   The Clean Air Act and the Americans with Disabilities Actrepresent two of the largest hidden tax burdens to hit theeconomy in 1991 and 1992. In both of these cases, theadministration and Congress appear to have seriouslyunderestimated the cost of compliance with these acts. Bothof these acts are worded so vaguely that the regulatorybodies have raised the cost of compliance far above theofficial figures. The numbers presented in the accompanyingtable are conservative estimates.   The official estimate for complying with the Clean Air Actwas put at roughly $25 billion per year. Nongovernmentalestimates of the cost of complying with the act range as highas $100 billion per year. The table shows a compromisecompliance cost of $25 billion in new compliance expendituresfor 1991 and an additional $25 billion for 1992.   It appears too that the cost of complying with theAmericans with Disabilities Act will be staggering. Thedisabilities act was supposed to cost $2 billion annually,but depending on how aggressively it is implemented, the costof compliance could easily amount to at least $20 billion ayear for the next five years.   Based on an early sample of plans to alter officebuildings to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act,the cost of compliance appears to be close to $5 per squarefoot. This figure does not take into account all possiblemodifications, but just those that are deemed &quot;reasonable.&quot;   There are an estimated 180,000 square feet in an averageoffice building. This places the cost of compliance at almost$1 million per building. There are an estimated nine billionsquare feet of office space in the nation, bringing the totalcompliance cost nationwide to $45 billion. And that's justfor office space.   The American Hospital Association, a hospital lobby,estimates that its members will have to spend $20 billion tobring hospitals into compliance. We're already at $65 billionand counting -- and that's before considering the costs forequipping trains, buses, restaurants, rental cars and publicfacilities.   In addition to the costs of complying with these mandates,there are legal and administrative costs to consider. In thecase of the Americans with Disabilities Act, vagueterminology virtually assures billions of dollars per year inlegal expenses. No attempt was made to estimate these legaland administrative expenses.   None of these calculations should be taken to suggest thatit is somehow wrong or bad to spend money for cleaner air orto help the disabled. The list of worthy causes has no reallimits. Unfortunately, there are definite limits to theamount by which tax and regulatory burdens can be raisedwithout having a serious economic impact. The presenteconomic situation strongly suggests that the push towardhigher tax and regulatory burdens has had much greater costsin terms of lost jobs and weaker productivity than mostpeople had assumed.   Recent productivity trends clearly support the sense thatsomething is wrong. But the problem is not that Americans are&quot;lazy,&quot; as a Japanese politician has recently been quoted assuggesting. Part of the recent weakness in productivity canbe attributed to the recession. Productivity tends toincrease more slowly than normal during recessions and fasterthan normal during recoveries.   Still, adjustments can be made for cyclical developments.Judging from past experience, the magnitude of the currentrecession should have caused actual productivity to fallapproximately 2% below a level consistent with a fullyemployed economy. After making such an adjustment, we seethat it becomes readily apparent that U.S. cyclicallyadjusted productivity has deteriorated dramatically in recentyears. The record of what we can call underlying productivityis convincing support for the widespread sense that America'seconomic problems are more fundamental than cyclical.   Each society has its fair share of workers and loafers.The extent to which those workers improve their productivitydepends far more on the overall economic environment in whichthey operate than on their inherent intelligence orinitiative. Tax burdens are an important determinant of thatenvironment.   During the period from the late 1970s to 1981,productivity growth in the U.S. deteriorated dramatically astax burdens rose. With the tax cuts of 1982-84, U.S.productivity growth returned to its long-term average.Productivity rose by approximately 1.5% per year in themid-1980s, and the nation experienced its longest peacetimeexpansion. More recently, the resumption of highertraditional and hidden tax burdens has again brought about afundamental deterioration in the nation's productivity trendand a renewed sense of economic malaise.   After showing the rest of the world how lower tax ratescould boost productivity and living standards, the U.S.regressed. Fortunately, the U.S. economy can revive. Layoffscan be brought to an end and productivity growth restored.   Many politicians have maintained that such a revival wouldmean painful measures. In a sense, they are right. A truerevival would involve major cuts in traditional and hiddentaxes to offset the increased burdens that have occurred.This, of course, would not be painful for most workers andbusinesses -- they would keep more of their income. But itwould be painful for politicians and, in some cases, thosewho benefit from regulation, such as the handicapped. Cuts intraditional taxes or in regulation would mean thatpoliticians would be forced to recognize that there areeffective limits to what public policy can accomplish.   In a democracy, the public seldom tolerates poor economicperformance for very long. For those politicians who fail torecognize the limits to public policy, there will eventuallybe political costs as well.   ---   Mr. Genetski heads Robert Genetski andamp; Assoc., aChicago-based consulting firm.   ---                                                                                                                     Billions of additional dollars                                                                                                                                1988   1989   1990   1991   1992                                                                                                        Payroll Tax             $13.0  $14.0  $10.9  $14.0  $ 7.4 Changes in Depreciation   Schedules               4.6   22.3   20.6    4.0      0 New Taxes, 1987           6.2   ----   ----   ----   ---- New Taxes, 1989          ----    0.1    5.6   ----   ---- New Taxes in 1990   Budget Accord          ----   ----   ----   23.2   10.0 Higher Deposit   Insurance Premiums     ----    0.5    1.4    1.8    1.8 Clean Air Act            ----   ----   ----   25.0   25.0 Americans With   Disabilities Act       ----   ----   ----   ----   20.0 Federal Total            23.8   36.9   38.5   68.0   64.2 State Taxes              N.A.
