Peter Brant also was placed on probation for five years andordered to do 750 hours of community service. U.S. District JudgeCharles E. Stewart did not say what the community service would be.   Brant, 35, a former broker at Kidder Peabody andamp; Co., pleadedguilty in 1984 to conspiracy and securities fraud. He admitted hispart in a scheme to trade stock in 24 companies on the basis ofinformation that was to appear in the Journal's ``Heard on theStreet'' column.   The material Brant received came from R. Foster Winans, aJournal reporter who wrote the column. During a five-month period,the scheme netted almost $700,000, of which Winans got $31,000 andBrant got most of the rest.   Winans, whose mail, wire and securities fraud convictions wereupheld by the U.S. Supreme Court last November, is serving an18-month sentence. Brant's sentencing was delayed pending the highcourt decision and because of his cooperation in other cases.   Brant's lawyer, Stephen Weiner, pleaded for leniency, askingStewart to consider ``the brutal price already paid'' by hisclient. Brant, who now works for a telecommunications company inWest Palm Beach, Fla., has agreed to stay out of the securitiesbusiness for life.   The judge said he found the defendant ``at least as guilty asMr. Winans and perhaps more so.''   Stewart could have sentenced Brant to 15 years in prison andfined him $30,000, but he took into account Assistant U.S. AttorneyCarl Loewenson's request that he consider Brant's cooperation inprosecuting two major criminal cases.   One case Loewenson referred to was the prosecutions of Winans,Winans' roommate David Carpenter, and former Kidder Peabody brokerKenneth P. Felis who had roles in the Wall Street Journal tradingscheme.   Felis is serving six months of weekends and Carpenter was placedon probation and directed to do community service.   The second case involved former lawyer David W.C. Clark,convicted last November of embezzling more than $3.7 million fromclients from 1980 to 1984.   Clark, who died of chronic alcoholism a few days before he wasto be sentenced, used the embezzled funds to trade securities basedon the insider information Brant passed on to him from the Journalcolumn.</TEXT></DOC>
