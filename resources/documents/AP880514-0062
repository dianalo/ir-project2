In the Gaza strip's Shati refugee camp, Israeli soldiers openedfire to disperse stone-throwing demonstrators, wounding a16-year-old Palestinian in the leg, said doctors at Gaza City'sAhli Arab Hospital. Three Arabs suffered beating injuries. The armysaid it was checking the report.   PLO leaders orchestrating the Arab protests in the occupiedlands allowed stores to open for several hours this morning in mostareas of the Gaza Strip, the West Bank and Arab east Jerusalem. Themove allowed residents to stock up for the three-day holidaymarking the end of Ramadan next week.   In Gaza, Palestinian youths burned tires in the main street atnoon, a signal to the merchants that it was time to close again,said an Arab reporter who spoke on condition of anonymity.   At Jerusalem's sacred mosque complex, hundreds of Arabworshipers protesting Israeli occupation battled riot police afterRamadan prayers Friday, leaving 20 Arabs and four policemeninjured. Nineteen Arabs were arrested.   Police firing rubber bullets stormed the complex afterprotesters threw stones, chanted nationalist slogans and burnedIsraeli flags. Israel radio said a U.S. flag also was set ablaze.   About 3,300 police officers have been deployed in Jerusalemsince Thursday to maintain order during Ramadan prayers.   Authorities said the beefed-up force would remain at leastthrough Sunday, the 40th anniversary of the founding of Israel andalso Jerusalem Day, when Israelis mark the anniversary of thecapture of Arab east Jerusalem in 1967.   The army freed 281 Palestinian prisoners Friday in a holidaygesture. Still imprisoned are more than 4,500 Arabs arrested sincethe uprising began Dec. 8 in the lands Israel seized in the 1967Middle East war.   The army recently released from prison about 100 youths betweenthe ages of 14 and 16, leaving only a few in that age group incustody, army West Bank commander Maj. Gen. Amram Mitzna toldIsrael radio Friday.   He said no prisoners were younger than 14.   About 15,000 Moslem worshipers attended Ramadan prayers Fridayat Jerusalem's Temple Mount. Last year's attendance was 200,000.   The numbers were drastically reduced after the army sealed offGaza Thursday night, barring the coastal strip's 650,000 residentsfrom entering Israel. Roadblocks also prevented most of the WestBank's 850,000 Palestinians from reaching Jerusalem.   After prayers in Jerusalem, about 1,000 worshipers marchedaround the Temple Mount, chanting ``Jews out'', ``We don't want tosee any Zionists'' and ``No fear, no fear. The stone is better thanthe Kalashnikov (rifle).''   A few hundred youths hurled stones at the police station facingthe Al Aqsa Mosque there. Seconds later, about 100 helmeted riotpolice carrying clubs and assault rifles charged the complex,firing rubber bullets into the crowd.   Hospital officials said they treated 20 Arabs for rubber bulletinjuries, and police spokesman Rafi Levy said four police officerswere slightly hurt by hurled stones.   At least 10 injured Arabs were carried across the complex onstretchers. An elderly Arab, blood streaming down his face, shouted`God is great' and flashed a victory sign. Four or five women werealso carried out on stretchers.   During the two-hour clash, many worshipers remained inside themosque, afraid to leave. The Moslem prayer leader appealed topolice through loudspeakers to withdraw.   Residents in the West Bank city of Nablus and neighboringrefugee camps remained confined to their homes for a second daytoday.   The army imposed the curfew after receiving ``warnings thatpeople in Nablus planned disturbances,'' Mitzna said.   In the Gaza Strip city of Khan Yunis, soldiers fired rubberbullets at a car that crashed through an army roadblock Friday, andan Arab passenger was struck in the eye, the army said.   Army officials have said more than 1,400 Arabs have been injuredin the uprising, along with 298 soldiers and 172 Israeli settlers.   The U.N. lists 187 Arabs and two Israelis killed since Dec. 8.</TEXT></DOC>
