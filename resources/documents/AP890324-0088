(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   An attorney for Jim Bakker says theevangelist and former PTL owner won't be buying the former Nautilusproperty as a broadcasting headquarters.   Reports earlier this week that Bakker wouldn't be buying theNautilus sports medicine facility led opponents of the possible saleto call off a meeting to protest Bakker's presence in the smallcommunity.   The 158,000-square-foot Nautilus facility reportedly carried aprice tag of $5.5 million.   The two sides failed to reach agreement on the terms, saidBakker's attorney George Davis. Negotiations with the currentNautilus owner, Travis Ward, broke down after five minutes, he said.   Davis said Ward wanted $2 million up front and a definitecommitment, conditions Bakker and his business backers fromCharlotte, N.C., said they couldn't provide.   Nautilus founder Arthur Jones sold his Nautilus exerciseequipment company to Ward in 1986. Ward then moved the company toDallas after the purchase.   Officials at Studio Six Productions in Orlando, part of the WCPXtelevision station, said Wednesday they had put in a bid to serve asa temporary broadcast facility for Bakker's ministry, a WCPX newsreport said.   Bakker's lawyers said no decision has been made either on a siteor on any broadcast arrangement. They also refused to comment onthat report of the Studio Six Productions offer.   Bakker, who has pleaded not guilty to charges that he and anotherPTL leader took $4 million from the PTL ministry, has been searchingfor a new site for his TV pulpit.</TEXT></DOC>
