For the reasons set out below, the Petition is denied.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">Background </ITAG>History of the Petition EPA proposed to add the L-P site to the NPL on October 15, 1984 (49 FR40320, 40332). The Agency established a 60-day period for the receipt ofpublic comments on the proposal; L-P did not submit any comments. The finalrule adding the L-P site to the NPL was issued on June 10, 1986 (51 FR21054, 21072); L-P did not petition the U.S. Court of Appeals (D.C. Circuit)for judicial review of that rule during the 90-day period provided forin CERCLA section 113(a).\1\<NOTE/> L-P's first formal objection to the listing of its site onthe NPL came to the attention of the Administrator in the present Petition,dated September 26, 1988. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ ``CERCLA'' is the Comprehensive Environment Response,Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, 42 U.S.C. 9601-9657, commonly knownas ``Superfund.'' It was amended by the Superfund Amendments and ReauthorizationAct of 1986 (``SARA''), Pub. L. No. 99-499, 100 Stat. 1613 (1986). The L-P Petition was filed under the authority of the Administrative ProcedureAct (``APA''), 5 U.S.C. 553(e), which provides that ``[e]ach agency shallgive an interested person the right to petition for the issuance, amendment,or repeal of a rule.'' The APA goes on to provide that when such petitionsare denied, the agency should give ``a brief statement of the grounds fordenial.'' 5 U.S.C. 555(e); <T3>American Horse Protection Assoc. </T3>v. <T3>Lyng, </T3>812 F.2d 1, 4 (D.C. Cir. 1987). Statutory and Regulatory Background As a threshold matter, it is important to understand the process for addingand removing sites from the NPL. Section 105(a)(8)(B) of CERCLA, as amended,expressly directed the President (EPA by delegation) to list the ``nationalpriorities among the known releases or threatened releases (of hazardoussubstances, pollutants and contaminants) throughout the United States,''based upon the criteria established in the National Contingency Plan (NCP),40 CFR Part 300. The NCP established criteria for such listings in theform of a Hazard Ranking System (HRS), a method developed by EPA for evaluatingthe relative risks at sites at which releases or threatened releases takeplace. 40 CFR Part 300, Appendix A. The Agency applies the HRS to informationconcerning an observed or potential release to obtain a numerical ``score''or estimate of ``the probability and magnitude of harm to the human populationor sensitive environment from exposure to hazardous substances as a resultof the contamination of ground water, surface water, or air.'' 47 FR 31180,31187 (July 16, 1982). Sites receiving scores of 28.50 or greater are proposedfor inclusion on the NPL in a notice-and-comment rulemaking. The information collected to develop HRS scores and therefore to supportthe listing of sites on the NPL, is not sufficient in itself to determinethe appropriate remedy for a site. The Agency generally relies on further,more detailed studies_such as a Remedial Investigation/Feasibility Study(RI/FS)_to determine what response, if any, is appropriate. The RI/FS isundertaken to determine ``the nature and extent of the threat posed bythe release and to evaluate remedial alternatives,'' including the alternativeof taking no action. 40 CFR 300.68(d). Members of the public are affordedan opportunity to comment on the potential remedial alternatives at a site(40 CFR 300.67(d)), and to comment on the remedy proposed by EPA (CERCLAsection 117(a)). In enacting CERCLA, Congress specified that the NPL was intended to servea narrow purpose.<ITAG tagnum="21">The priority lists serve primarily informational purposes, identifyingfor the States and the public those facilities and sites or other releaseswhich appear to warrant remedial actions. Inclusion of a facility or siteon the list does not in itself reflect a judgment of the activities ofits owner or operator, it does not require those persons to undertake anyaction, nor does it assign liability to any person. Subsequent governmentaction in the form of remedial actions or enforcement action will be necessaryin order to do so, and these actions will be attended by all appropriateprocedural safeguards.</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">S. Rep. No. 848, 96th Cong., 2d Sess. 60 (1980).\2\<NOTE/> EPA has affirmed this language in numerous preamble statementsto NPL rulemakings (<T3>see, e.g., </T3>48 FR 40658, 40659 (September 8, 1983), and 52 FR 27620,27621 (July 22, 1987)), and in its regulations (see 40 CFR 300.66(c)(2)).As those regulations indicate, the only substantive effect of listing asite on the NPL is that the site becomes eligible for remedial \3\<NOTE/> action financed by the Superfund (the ``Fund'') establishedunder CERCLA. The listing does not require any action of any private party,nor does it determine the liability of any party for the cost of cleanupactions that may be undertaken at the site. Note also that listing on theNPL is not a prerequisite to removal actions, non-Fund financed remedialactions, or enforcement actions taken under section 106 of CERCLA.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ <T3>Reprinted</T3> in 1 Senate Comm. on Environment andamp; Public Works,97th Cong., 2d Sess., <T3>A Legislative History of the Comprehensive Environmental Response,Compensation and Liability Act of 1980</T3> at 367 (Comm. Print 1983).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ ``Remedial'' actions are those associated with a long-termor permanent remedy to address damage resulting from the release of hazardoussubstances (CERCLA section 101(24)), as compared to ``removal'' actions,which are generally immediate or interim measures necessary to prevent,minimize or mitigate damage from a release of hazardous substances (CERCLAsection 101(23)). (Remedial and removal actions are collectively referredto as ``response'' actions, CERCLA section 101(25).)In light of the limited purpose of the NPL, and the complex set of proceduresfor site evaluation and response provided for in the NCP, EPA explainedin the preamble to the first NPL rule that it would not continually reviseHRS scores assigned to sites as new information became available:<ITAG tagnum="21">EPA believes that it is most consistent with that statutory purposeto cease the costly and time-consuming efforts of site scoring once theNPL development process on a site is complete. Rather than spend the limitedresources of the [F]und on rescoring efforts, the Agency wants to use allavailable resources to clean up sites.</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">48 FR 40658, 40669 (September 8, 1983). EPA recognized that a requirementto re-score sites would severely slow down the important work of evaluatingand addressing problem sites. Moreover, because the score of a site issimply the means of including it on the NPL, and does not determine a party'sliability or even if any response will be taken, revising the score isunnecessary. Instead, the Agency studies the sites in greater detail accordingto the criteria established in the NCP, and based on such studies, takesresponse actions or proceeds to delete the sites, as appropriate.The criteria for the deletion of sites from the NPL are set out in 40 CFR300.66(c)(7), and provide that sites may be deleted from the NPL ``whereno further response (including studies) is appropriate.'' In general, theevaluation of whether a site should be deleted comes at two distinct pointsin the site evaluation and response process. First, after the RI/FS hasbeen completed, EPA and the State consider whether the release has beenfound to pose ``no significant threat to public health or the environment'';if so, the taking of CERCLA response measures is not appropriate, and thesite may be deleted from the NPL. Second, EPA and the State evaluate sitesafter required response measures have been taken; the site may then bedeleted if it is determined that no further action is appropiate.As the Agency has noted in past <T4>Federal Register</T4> notices, the deletion of a site from the NPLdoes not itself create, alter or revoke any individual rights or obligations.The NPL is designed primarily for informational purposes and to assistAgency management. 50 FR 53448, 53449 (December 31, 1985). Further, thedeletion regulations in the NCP make clear that sites deleted from theNPL remain eligible for further Fund-financed response actions withoutthe requirement of re-listing, should future conditions warrant such action.40 CFR 300.66(c)(8).<ITAG tagnum="84">Disposition of Petition</ITAG>Request for Reevaluation Under the HRSThe L-P Petition requests, <T3>inter alia</T3>, a second analysis of conditions at the L-P site underthe HRS (Petition, at p. 30). This request must be rejected. As explainedabove, the Agency does not go back and re-score sites based on new informationonce the process of scoring and listing a site has been completed. To doso would put the Agency in a situation of continually rescoring, detractingfrom the more important work of cleaning up sites. In rejecting recentchallenges to the NPL, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit explained:<ITAG tagnum="21">Certainly, EPA could have permitted further comment or conducted furthertesting. Either course would have consumed further assets of the Agencyand would have delayed a determination of the risk priority associatedwith the site. Yet as we have recognized elsewhere, ``the NPL is simplya rough list of priorities, assembled quickly and inexpensively to complywith Congress' mandate for the Agency to take action straightaway.'' <T3>Eagle-Picher II</T3>, 759 F.2d at 932 [D.C.Cir. 1985]. Once again,we determine that ``EPA's decision to reconcile the need for certaintybefore action with the need for inexpensive, expeditious procedures toidentify potentially hazardous sites * * * is reasonable and fully in accordwith congressional intent.'' <T3>Eagle Picher I</T3>, 759 F.2d at 921 [D.C.Cir. 1985].</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T3>City of Stoughton, Wisconsin</T3> v. <T3>EPA</T3>, 858 F.2d 747, 751 (D.C.Cir. 1988).The courts have also indicated that challenges to HRS scores not raisedduring the public comment period may not be raised later. <T3>Northside Sanitary Landfill</T3> v. <T3>EPA</T3>, 849 F.2d 1516, 1521 (D.C.Cir. 1988); <T3>Eagle-Picher Industries</T3> v. <T3>EPA</T3>, 822 F.2d 132, 146 (D.C.Cir. 1987). As the U.S. Court of Appealsfor the D.C. Circuit noted in <T3>Natural Resources Defense Council</T3> v. <T3>Nuclear Regulatory Commission</T3>, 666 F.2d 595, 602 (D.C.Cir. 1981),the right to petition for repeal of a rule does not ``permit back doorprocedural challenges by those who had the opportunity to seek direct reviewof regulations but failed to do so in a timely fashion. Indeed, the caselaw suggests the opposite. <T3>See Geller</T3> v. <T3>FCC</T3>, 610 F.2d 973, 977 (D.C.Cir. 1979).''As noted above, L-P did not comment on the proposed listing of the L-Psite in 1984, nor did it comment on the HRS score supporting that proposal.The Petition now alleges a deficiency in the HRS scoring package, i.e.,the finding of an ``observed release'' from the facility (<T3>see</T3> Appendix E to the Petition), but that alleged deficiency wasa component of the original HRS score, and could have been raised duringthe original site listing comment period. Thus, the Petition is not timelyon this point.\4\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ Even assuming, <T3>arguendo</T3>, that the comment were timely, L-P admits in its Petitionthat there were in fact releases of hazardous substances from the L-P facilityto the environment (<T3>see</T3> notes 5 and 11 <T3>infra</T3>.), and EPA's analysis of the facts confirms that finding.Requestfor a Finding of ``No Response Action Necesary'' The Petition also appears to request removal of the L-P site from the NPLon the grounds that the levels of contaminants at the site pose ``no endangermentto human health and the environment'' (Petition at p. 9). This requestis also premature, and is not supported by the facts. The Petition itself acknowledges that contamination exists at the L-P site,\5\<NOTE/> and indeed, suggests that some further response activitiesmay be appropriate at the site.\6\<NOTE/> However, it argues that the threat is limited such that EPA``may'' conclude that no response is warranted, at least from L-P.\7\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ As the Petition notes at p. 1, ``[r]ecent investigationsby CH2M-Hill, a contractor retained by L-P, have determined that pentachlorophenol(`penta', `PCP') contamination [has been] observed at various locationson the L-P sawmill/medium density fiberboard (MDF) complex at Oroville,California * * *. <T3>See also </T3>Petition at 14, ``CH2M-Hill found some contaminationof soils in the vicinity of the fungicide spray area''; and Petition at21, ``[t]he source of [the] dioxin is believed to be occasional overflowsfrom the L-P fungicide system.'' <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\ In return for the granting of its petition, L-P offers(1) to complete an air study under the terms of its consent order withEPA, ``(2) keep the fire well operative <T3>to maintain its current ability to inhibit migration</T3>, (3) maintainthe drainage ditch in such a manner <T3>so as to preserve its ability to degrade PCP wastes</T3> * * *.'' (Petition,at p. 31) (emphasis added). The Petition at p. 22 further states that ``[s]inceKoppers is the source of PCP in the area of the ditch, it should bear theresponsibility of investigating this area for dioxins.''<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\ For example, the Petition states that ``EPA <T3>can determine that there is </T3><T3>little </T3>contamination and <T3>essentially</T3> no possibility of migration'' (Petition, at 14); ``EPA<T3>can conclude the soil contamination does not warrant additional response</T3><T3>from L-P</T3>'' (Petition, at 17); ``[b]ased on the <T3>minimal possibility </T3>of exposure, EPA <T3>can rationally conclude </T3>that there is no threat to human healthor the environment from exposure to PCP from air sources'' (Petition, at18); and ``<T3>L-P believes </T3>that <T3>sufficient </T3>data is available <T3>to enable EPA </T3>to dismiss formaldehyde contained in water and soilas a threat to human health'' (Petition, at 27). (Emphasis added.) EPA has, indeed, been conferred the discretion and the responsibility todecide if response action is warranted at sites where hazardous substanceshave been released into the environment; the Agency has not, however, cometo the conclusion advanced by the Petition that the levels of contaminantsat the site pose ``no endangerment to human health and the environment.''In fact, EPA has not yet completed its RI/FS at the site, and thus hasnot yet determined the full extent and nature of the contamination, andthe public health and environmental risks associated with that contamination.\8\<NOTE/> The Agency will consider the comments on site conditionscontained in the Petition as the Agency continues to evaluate the contaminationat the site; however, at this point in the process and based on the currentrecord, EPA cannot agree with the contention in the Petition that no actionis necesary. The Agency finds that grounds for deletion of the site fromthe NPL do not, at present, exist.\9\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\8\ An RI/FS was commenced at the L-P site in December 1986,financed by the Fund established under CERCLA; L-P declined to performthe work itself.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\ The Petition at p. 12 argues that levels of PCP at thesite ``are within the proposed and advisory criteria * * * indicating thatthe L-P site poses no threat to the environment.'' The issue of whetheror not contaminant levels exceed drinking water standards is not relevantfor NPL listing purposes. As the HRS explains, ``if a contaminant is measuredin ground water * * * at a significantly (<T3>in terms of demonstrating that a release has occurred, not in termsof potential effects</T3>) higher level than the background level, then* * * a release has been observed.'' 40 CFR Part 300, Appendix A, section3.1. <T3>See also </T3>48 FR 40658, 40665 (September 8, 1983); 47 FR 31180,31188 (July 16, 1982). The Agency may, however, consider such standardsas it proceeds to evaluate the extent of groundwater treatment, if any,that should ultimately be required.Request for Deletion Based on a Findingof No Liability The Petition also appears to argue that the L-P site should be deletedfrom the NPL because the L-P company itself is a small contributor to therelease at the site: deleting the site ``will provide for more equitableenforcement in this matter in that the responsibility and burden of theRI/FS process would be shifted from a non-resposible party to the partywhich caused the release.'' (Petition at p. 2.) As the cover letter tothe Petition states, the ``crux of the petition is that the presence ofhazardous substances on this site is due to the migration of wastes farman adjoining Superfund site.''\10\<NOTE/> However, even if the Petitioner may ultimately be able toprove that the neighboring Koppers company is a major contributor to thecontamination on the L-P property, and thus reduce L-P's liability, thisargument does not constitute grounds for deleting the site.\11\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\10\ <T3>See also </T3>Petition at 7: ``The source of this contamination isbelieved to have been effluent and contaminated groundwater flowing fromthe Koppers wood preserving facility * * *.''<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\11\ Note that the Petitioner agrees that it is responsiblefor at least some of the contamination at the site. <T3>See </T3>Petition at p. 5 (``[t]he L-P site used small quantities ofpentacholorophenol from 1970 to 1984 * * *. <T3>Minor losses occurred </T3>from downstream drippage (which was largelycontained) and <T3>occasional overflows </T3>from system blockages''); at p. 6 (``[I]tis <T3>likely that some PCP may have infiltrated </T3>through cracks in thepaved area [at the L-P site].''). The question of whether or not a site has been appropriately included onthe NPL is not affected by the number of, or existence of any, potentiallyresponsible parties. Indeed, a site may be listed even where no PRP's canbe identified (e.g., abandoned sites). As noted above, listing on the NPLdoes not represent a determination of any party's liability or its shareof response costs (including its share of RI/FS costs). Those issues willbe decided if and when EPA brings an action for recovery of its costs pursuantto section 107 of CERCLA) or in an enforcement action under section 106of CERCLA), and L-P and other parties will have full opportunity to contesttheir cost shares at that time.\12\<NOTE/> Thus, while L-P's argument that Koppers is the major contributorat the L-P site may be grounds for reducing liability in a future contributionaction, it is irrelevant to the question of whether the L-P site shouldbe on the NPL, and it does not constitute grounds for deleting the sitefrom the NPL.\13\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\12\ Note that in the instant case, L-P has not been orderedto conduct the RI/FS at the site; rather, it was provided the opportunityto do so, but declined. It is also important to note that L-P, and otherinterested parties, will have the opportunity to participate in the decisionconcerning what remedial action should be taken at the site (see 40 CFR300.67(d) and CERCLA section 117(a)).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\13\ The Petition also claims that ``EPA will be able to reduceits administrative burden by combining what are currently two sites intoa single site.'' (Petition at p. 2.) This also does not constitute groundsfor deletion of a site. In any event, EPA has authority under CERCLA section104(d)(4) to treat two facilities as one for the purpose of taking responseactions, even if the sites have been separately listed.Request for DeletionBased on Existing Consent OrderThe Petition also argues that the proposed rule modification is appropriatebecause response measures are already planned based on an existing consentorder between L-P and EPA. The existence of this consent order does notprovide grounds for deleting the site from the NPL. First, the consentorder merely commits L-P to investigate releases into the air at the facility;it does not include all response measures that EPA may, after the completionof the RI/FS, determine to be necessary in order to address contaminationat the L-P site. Second, EPA regulations and policies on NPL listings donot provide for deletion based on an outstanding order to perform workat a site. Indeed, in prior rulemakings the Agency considered and rejectedthat approach as inconsistent with the purpose of the NPL to keep interestedparties and neighboring residents informed about the progress of remedialactions at NPL sites. <T3>See</T3> 49 FR 37070, 37075 (September 21, 1984).\1\\4\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\4\ However, in the proposed revisions to the NCP (53 FR51394, 51419 (December 21, 1988), the Agency is taking comment on the morelimited idea of deleting sites in cases where a party signs an enforceableconsent order under CERCLA to perform <T3>all</T3> necessary remedial action at a site. The Petitioner, likeother members of the public, will have the opportunity to comment on thatproposal.Request for Public HearingFinally, the Petition requested that EPA conduct an informal public hearingon this matter, although it offered no reasons why such a hearing was believedto be necessary. The Agency does not believe that a hearing is necessaryor appropriate in this matter.The Agency has already conducted a national notice-and-comment rulemakingon whether the L-P site was appropriate for inclusion on the NPL (49 FR40320, 40332 (October 15, 1984)). L-P has now asked the Agency to reconsiderthat decision, and it has submitted the information it deems relevant tothe issue at hand. Thus, the Agency has the relevant information beforeit with which to make a decision on the present Petition. Further, theCongress and the courts have consistently stated that agencies are notrequired to conduct a hearing or begin an additional round of rulemakingin responding to rulemaking petitions filed under the APA, 5 U.S.C. 553(e).\1\\5\<NOTE/> For these reasons, the request for a hearing is denied.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\5\ In its report on the APA, the Senate Judiciary Committeeemphasized that ``[t]he mere filing of a [section 553(e)] petition doesnot require an agency to grant it, or to hold a hearing, or engage in anyother public rulemaking proceedings.''

At numerous points in the process,members of the public have an opportunity to comment on EPA's actions,such as through comments on the proposed listing of a site, comments onthe proposed remedy selection, and comments on proposed site deletions.The Petitioner in this case has asked for an extraordinary chance to commentat a point outside these normal, detailed procedures.EPA finds that the reasons advanced by Petitioner for the requested deletionof the L-P site are neither persuasive nor timely. Thus, EPA will not modifythe rule that has placed the L-P site on the NPL. Rather, the Agency willcontinue to evaluate the release at the L-P site until such time as theAgency determines that no significant threat to human health or the environmentis posed, or until response actions determined to be necessary have beencompleted, consistent with the deletion criteria in the NCP.<ITAG tagnum="84">Conclusion</ITAG>For the reasons stated above, the petition of Louisiana-Pacific Corporationis denied.
