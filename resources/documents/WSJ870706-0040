Terms weren't disclosed.    BioTechnica said the proposed purchase would enable it to enter the agriculture market as it develops improved seeds and other agricultural products with genetic engineering techniques. Closely held McAllister sells corn, soybean, alfalfa and other seeds in Iowa, Missouri and Illinois, BioTechnica said.    BioTechnica said its first genetically engineered agricultural product probably will be an improved kind of nitrogen-fixing bacteria for alfalfa. The bacteria can convert more nitrogen from the air into fertilizer than can naturally occurring bacteria that do the same thing, the company said.    BioTechnica is awaiting federal regulatory approval to begin field tests with the bacteria in Pepin County, Wis. Norman Jacobs, BioTechnica's president, said the company expects to receive the approval within a few weeks and to begin the tests later this summer. The bacteria probably will reach the market in 1989 and be sold combined with seeds or as an additive to be planted with seeds, Mr. Jacobs said. </TEXT></DOC>
