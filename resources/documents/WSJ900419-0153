Clark Jr.</HL><DATE>04/19/90</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A14</SO><IN>ECONOMIC NEWS (ECO)</IN><LP>   After the horrendous bouts with inflation in the 1970s andearly 1980, it was natural that our kind-hearted governmentwould want to do something to ease future inflation pains.   Social Security benefits are indexed, and in this taxseason most of us know that the government has taken stepstoward indexing ordinary income taxes. For tax yearsbeginning after 1988, the taxable income bracket at which the28% rate begins has been subject to adjustment for inflation.The standard deduction also is adjusted to reflect inflation.</LP><TEXT>   There are a number of other proposals kicking around tolessen inflation's sting. Capital income might be indexed,the government might issue indexed bonds or it might even payinterest on money. Two economists, however, suggest that suchinflation-softening measures might be very bad ideas.   Stanley Fischer of the World Bank and MIT and LawrenceSummers of Harvard believe that such gimmicks may help toassure that the inflation will persist. &quot;Should GovernmentsLearn to Live With Inflation?&quot; is the title of their paperreprinted by the National Bureau of Economic Research.(Reprint No. 1347.) Their answer is an emphatic, &quot;No.&quot;   &quot;Our main conclusion,&quot; they write, &quot;is that governmentswhose ability to maintain low rates of inflation is uncertainshould not reduce the costs of actual inflation. Measuresthat reduce the cost of anticipated inflation, or undercutopposition to it, are particularly likely to be pernicious.&quot;   It would be reasonable to say that the U.S. government'sability to maintain low inflation rates is at leastuncertain. The double-digit inflation rates of 1979, 1980 and1981 were finally beaten down by major Federal Reservesurgery, involving the deep recession of 1981-82. With thehelp of an oil price drop, the rate actually fell below 2% in1986, but it bounced right back up. The rate has beenvacillating between 4% and 5%, though it shot up to 8.5% inthe first quarter. Nevertheless, administration officials arewont to say that inflation has been &quot;contained,&quot; whateverthat means.   When you've weathered the high inflation rates of the1970s and early 1980s, it's easy to sniff at 4% to 5%inflation. That, in effect, is exactly what the Council ofEconomic Advisers does in the latest Economic Report. &quot;Low,predictable rates of inflation,&quot; the Council says, &quot;havelittle adverse effect on the economy.&quot; It's the high andwidely variable inflation rates that can do a lot of damageto economic performance. &quot;Low&quot; and &quot;high&quot; remain undefined.   Perceptions change over the years. When the inflation ratecrept above 4% in 1971, President Richard Nixon imposed wageand price controls.   Wage-price controls were obviously a desperate move; thegovernment didn't know what else to do. But so, to aconsiderable extent, is any effort to palliate the effects ofinflation. Former Federal Reserve Chairman Arthur Burns putit like this in 1978:   &quot;This (indexation) is a counsel of despair. . . . I doubtif there is any practical way of redesigning economiccontracts to deal with this problem satisfactorily. In anyevent, if a nation with our traditions attempted to make iteasy to live with inflation, rather than resist its corrosiveinfluence, we would slowly but steadily lose the sense ofdiscipline needed to pursue governmental policies with an eyeto the permanent welfare of our people.&quot;   The inflation palliatives make it easier for legislatorsto embark on spending programs that may have inflationaryeffects. With the safeguards in place, the lawmakers canreason, nobody is going to get hurt. But inflation mitigationpolicies, Mr. Fischer and Mr. Summers note, although theyreduce the cost of a given level of inflation, may end upmaking inflation more costly to society. Inflation is alwayscounterproductive, because the extra inflation that resultshas costs that exceed the direct benefits of protectingagainst inflation.   It isn't surprising that indexation has been especiallypopular in the high-inflation countries of Latin America.It's a way to keep the electorate reasonably quiet whilegovernments try to think of something else to do. Indexationis more controversial in relatively low (there's that wordagain) inflation countries such as the U.S.   Forgoing inflation palliatives, in a real sense, amountsto a commitment -- though hardly a perfect one -- to seekstable prices. A better way may be for the government toachieve a reputation for hating inflation. Once such areputation is attained -- West Germany and Switzerland havehad it pretty consistently in recent decades -- it isdifficult to give it up. The public becomes adjusted to aninflation rate of 1% or 2%, and if the rate goes higher itfeels it has been cheated. Inflation expectations andinterest rates rise, damaging the economy.   Profs. Fischer and Summers suggest that nations withimpeccable anti-inflation credentials have no reason to fearindexation and some reason to favor it. It's difficult forany country to control inflation precisely, and a countrywith very low rates might offer indexation as assurance that,if things went bad for a year or two, the public wouldn'tsuffer.   The authors don't get into it, but Japan might be in thatsort of situation now. Japan's inflation rates have been verylow. Consumer prices since the mid-1980s have usually risenabout 1% a year or less. But efforts to control the yen havecontributed to a sharp monetary expansion, with the resultthat consumer prices in the past year have been moving up atannual rates close to 3%.   The Bank of Japan has been raising interest rates to curbthe inflation, and perhaps it will succeed. But until theissue is settled, indexation might help if the governmentcould persuade the public that the current episode is no morethan a temporary aberration.   Otherwise the Japanese, like the Latin Americans, couldfind that better inflation protection would merely lead tomore inflation.</TEXT></DOC>
