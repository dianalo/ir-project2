You needenough coverage to pay the difference between the anticipated costs and whatyou can afford.;    Look for a policy that offers coverage, or the option ofadding coverage, for home health care. A combination of home-health-carecoverage and nursing-home coverage provides more options.;    Choose a policythat provides direct access to a wide array of care options. Try to avoidpolicies that require a prior hospital stay before the insured qualifies forcoverage and those that require a period of skilled nursing-home care beforecovering custodial (the most basic) care, home care or community-based adultday care. Ask about any exclusions for pre-existing conditions.;    Be surethe policy will cover long-term care due to Alzheimer's disease and relateddementias.;    Ask about inflation protection. Some policies offer an optionalinflation rider that annually increases benefit amounts to protect against theeffect of inflation.;    Ask for independent documentation of a company'sclaim-payment record.;    Avoid policies marked as &quot;conditionally&quot; or&quot;optionally&quot; renewable. &quot;Guaranteed&quot; renewability leaves the renewal decisionin your hands.;    Check A.M. Best's rating, which evaluates the insurancecompany's financial stability.;    Read your policy carefully and discuss itwith someone you trust who understands insurance matters.;    Q I'm 70 yearsold and take several prescription drugs. It's getting more difficult todetermine whether they help or hurt me. What can I do to avoid problems fromdrugs?;    A Drugs act differently in older people. The kidneys and the liverare two important organs responsible for breaking down and removing most drugsfrom the body. With age, these organs begin to function less efficiently.;   It is important to be aware of a drug's potential side-effects, and theyshould be reported to a doctor immediately. Your doctor can advise you on howbest to discontinue taking a drug. Often, a similar medication can besubstituted. If your doctor prescribes a new drug, ask for samples.;    Alsoask your doctor:;    (check)  Why do you need this particular drug? What is itlikely to do?;    (check)  Should you take the drug before, during or aftermeals?;    (check)  Are there any foods or beverages you should avoid while onthis medication?;    (check)  How long should you take the medication and whencan you expect to notice an improvement?;    (check)  How will the druginteract with other medications, including any over-the-counter medications,you are taking?;    Always carry a list of the prescription andnon-prescription drugs you take.
