How to raise $166 billion for closing sick savings-and-loan companies was the last major issue to be decided by the conferees on the landmark bill, which replenishes funds in the insolvent Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp., overhauls banking and thrift industry regulations, and requires Sandamp;Ls to risk more of their own capital before FSLIC insurance bails out depositors at an insolvent institution.    The compromise bill heads back to both chambers for final consideration next week, and could be on the president's desk by next Friday.    After months of the stalemate and almost six hours of debate of the financing plan yesterday, the Senate conferees persuaded Alan Cranston (D., Calif.), the lone Democratic holdout, to adopt the House financing plan, largely in exchange for acceding to him in an earlier agreement to keep the nation's top thrift official in place.    &quot;I reluctantly support this motion,&quot; Sen. Cranston said. &quot;Otherwise I see everlasting impasse in this conference.&quot;    Bush administration officials have vowed that such a move would prompt a veto recommendation, and yesterday Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady and Budget Director Richard Darman reiterated the message. &quot;We are pleased that the conference committee has finished work on the savings-and-loan legislation, which is generally an excellent product,&quot; Mr. Brady said. &quot;However, the administration position on financing is perfectly clear and remains unchanged.&quot;    But President Bush may be hard pressed to summon a veto on a bill he unveiled in February as &quot;emergency&quot; legislation, and one in which the administration's plan prevailed in almost every other important issue. &quot;The bill has so much that the president wants, and it's so important for the country, it's hard to believe that he would veto it&quot; because of the funding issue, said Rep. Charles Schumer (D., N.Y.), one of the proponents of the House financing plan.    The primary purpose of the bill is to raise $50 billion that would be used to close or merge hundreds of insolvent savings-and-loan companies. But how that money will be raised became a game of chicken between the administration and Democrats, who otherwise have largely backed the administration's tough positions.    The administration plan would raise $50 billion using industry bonds, which wouldn't be included on the federal budget, and thus not increase the budget deficit. The interest of more than $100 billion, to be paid mostly by the taxpayer, would be on the budget. But using industry bonds would increase the cost by more than $5 billion over 30 years, because they would carry a higher interest rate than Treasury bonds.    The House approved a plan to raise the money using Treasury bonds, and including the spending on the budget. The ultimate costs are lower, but it would require a waiver of the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law, a precedent the administration viewed as the first step in eroding discipline in the budget.    In a peculiar exchange, the fate of the financing plan hinged upon the close relationship between Sen. Jake Garn (R., Utah) and his former aide, Danny Wall, now chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board. House conferees, who had been intent on forcing Mr. Wall to again face confirmation by the Senate to keep his job, dropped their opposition in exchange for the on-budget vote.    &quot;I'm not the kind who makes deals,&quot; said House Banking Committee Chairman Henry Gonzalez (D., Texas), &quot;but {several senators} said they could get some roadblocks out of the way if there could be some understanding on Garn's insistence on Wall.&quot; On Wednesday, Mr. Gonzalez paved the way for speedy approval of steps to protect Mr. Wall's job.    Sen. Cranston, who voted for the administration plan in the Senate, also had reason to preserve Mr. Wall's job without reconfirmation hearings. His confrontations with Mr. Wall over a now-insolvent California thrift would have undoubtedly come under scrutiny again in a hearing.    Sen. Cranston proposed several compromises that would have put some of the money off-budget, but still violate the administration's proposal by requiring a Gramm-Rudman exemption. In the end, he conceded. &quot;Deadlock is intolerable,&quot; he said. &quot;Delay is intolerable.&quot;    Late last night, the conferees were finishing up provisions in the bill, including an attempt to strip the bill of special exemptions for certain institutions.    Late last night, the conferees completed final provisions in the bill, including one to establish conflict-of-interest rules for employees of the Resolution Trust Corp., the huge new arm of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., which will oversee thrift closures and sales of their assets.    The bill, which conferees hope the president will sign before the August recess, could still face hurdles, however. The Senate could invoke a rule to require 60 votes for its passage, due to the Gramm-Rudman exemption. Sen. Phil Gramm (R., Texas) has said earlier that he would call for the rule.    Key provisions of the bill include:    --Minimum capital, or the cash cushion for thrifts, would be 1.5% of assets. The greater the risk to a thrift's assets, the greater must be its capital base.    --The Federal Home Loan Bank Board would become an arm of the Treasury. Bank regulators and the Treasury would oversee the Resolution Trust Corp., which will sell or merge insolvent thrifts and their assets using $50 billion during the next three years.    --Deposit insurance premiums would be raised for banks and thrifts.    --Bank-holding companies would be permitted to acquire healthy thrifts immediately, which was prohibited under current law.    --Investments in high-yield junk bonds and other risky activities would be prohibited or allowed only in separately capitalized affiliates.    --Thrifts would be required to invest more in home mortgages.    --Federal Home Loan Banks would be required to contribute a percentage of their earnings toward low-income homebuyers. </TEXT></DOC>
