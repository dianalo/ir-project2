Neither the government nor any of Colombia's six guerrillagroups was represented at the conference, which the Roman CatholicChurch sponsored. The government had threatened the rebels witharrest if appeared.   Rebels demanded the peace conference in exchange for releasing aformer presidential candidate, Alvaro Gomez Hurtado. He wasabducted May 29 by the April 19 Movement, known as M-19, and heldfor 53 days.   Guerrillas and a representative of President Virgilio Barco sentmessages to the conference. About 60 people attended, includingchurch officials, 20 congressmen and business leaders.   The nation's smallest guerrilla group, the Workers'Revolutionary Party, said in a message that drug traffickers shouldattend ``because they are the main factors of destabilization'' ofColombia.   Other guerrilla groups said they would not surrender theirweapons as long as the army wages what the insurgents call a dirtywar.   Hundreds of people have disappeared and death squads have killedmore than 800 leftists in three years.   Guerrillas also demand that Gen. Rafael Samudio be fired asdefense minister and replaced by a civilian.   Cardenal Alfonso Lopez Trujillo said in a speech the rebels mustshow sincerity in any negotiations arising from the peaceconference and ``make some concrete gestures that demonstratewillingness to end bloodshed.''   A cease-fire negotiated with some guerrilla groups in 1982collapsed over the next two years, with rebels and army blamingeach other for truce violations. The army said the guerrillastricked the government into peace negotiations to give themselvestime to recuperate from military setbacks.   Barco spokesman Rafael Pardo said in a message to Friday'sconference the boycott does not mean the government refuses to talkwith the guerrillas.   He said talks should lead not to just ``living together with theguerrillas,'' but should have a goal of bringing the rebels ``intothe legal political process.''   Pardo is Barco's adviser on talks dealings with guerrillas andhas met several times with leaders of the Colombian RevolutionaryArmed Forces, the country's largest guerrilla group with anestimated 5,000-10,000 combatants.   In his message, Pardo asked the guerrillas to say what thegovernment would have to do to get them to end 30 years ofinsurrection.   Gomez was released despite the government's refusal to agree tobe host for the conference. The Catholic church, which helpednegotiate Gomez's freedom, organized the conference and Gomezattended it.   All of Colombia's six living former presidents were invited butnone attended.</TEXT></DOC>
