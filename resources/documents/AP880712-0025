Donald L. Sturm, 56, signed a consent agreement withoutadmitting guilt, settling a civil insider trading lawsuit filed bythe Securities and Exchange Commission.   The commission accused Sturm, identified as the owner of a bankand vice chairman of Omaha-based Peter Kiewit Sons Inc., aconstruction and manufacturing company, of getting information froma relative about the corporate takeover of Aviation Group Inc., aNorth Carolina air cargo service.   Sturm allegedly passed the information to a friend who bought30,000 shares of stock with money loaned by Sturm and made $128,412in trading profits, the SEC contended.   The SEC did not allege that Sturm made any money on thetransaction or had used the friend merely as a middleman to shieldstock purchases.   ``It's as if Sturm actually made the profits and gave it to thefriend, although he (Sturm) didn't buy the stock,'' said Jerry A.Isenberg, an SEC official in Washington.   Isenberg said Sturm _ not his friend _ was charged because Sturm``was involved in initiating the trade. He financed the trade.''   Sturm's attorney, Max Gitter, was out of town and unavailablefor comment.   However, The New York Times said in Tuesday's editions thatSturm issued a statement saying he did not pass on or possessmaterial non-public information.   ``Nor did I know that merger negotiations were under way,'' thestatement read. ``After months of efforts to convince the SEC thatit has drawn wrong conclusions, and knowing that I did nothingwrong, I have nonetheless chosen to settle this matter rather thanto dispute it any further.''   The SEC did not identify Sturm's bank, the relative who tippedhim off or the relative's investment bank.   But SEC filings at the time of the acquisition identified DrexelBurnham Lambert Inc. as the investment banking firm.   Besides the $154,085 in alleged illegal profits plus interest,Sturm agreed to pay the government $128,412 in penalties for atotal of $282,497.</TEXT></DOC>
