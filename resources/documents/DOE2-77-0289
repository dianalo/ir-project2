<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-77-0289 </DOCNO><TEXT>Data are presented showing that the key to observing the phonon-assistedphotopumped laser operation of narrow rectangular samples of Al/sub x/Ga/sub1-//sub x/As-GaAs quantum well heterostructures (QWHs) is the controlof the edge-to-edge resonator Q across the sample. If the sample is heatsunk in metal, with metal reflectors folded upward along the edges, theresonator Q across the sample is high, and laser operation across thesample on confined-particle states (a reference) and along the samplea phonon lower in energy ({Delta}E{approx_equal}(h/2{pi}){omega}/subLO/) is observed. If the sample edges across the sample are left uncoated(weakly reflecting, low Q), laser operation is observed only along thesample (longitudinal modes) but shifted ({Delta}E{approx_equal}(h/2{pi}){omega}/subLO/) below the confined-particle states and absorption. A QWH rectangle,with proper heat sinking and control of its edge-to-edge resonator Q,can act as a hot-phonon ''spectrometer'' if it is fully photopumped acrossits width and is only partially pumped along its length.</TEXT></DOC>
