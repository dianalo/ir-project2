Penney Co., settling Federal Trade Commission charges, agreed to file debt collection suits only in the judicial district in which the customer involved lives or had signed the disputed contract.    The FTC had charged that Penney's stores in Virginia had brought cases in districts outside the customer's area, and the agency contended that the practice unfairly deprived many consumers of the right to defend themselves in court. Penney's agreed to the proposed settlement, which applies nationwide, without admitting or denying the charges.    Under the plan, the company will be required either to transfer to a closer court, or dismiss, all pending cases brought in distant judicial districts. Penney's also must notify a customer if his case is transferred or dismissed, and the company must inform each credit reporting agency that may have a record of the suit if a case is dismissed.    In New York, a Penney's spokesman said the lawsuits to which the FTC objected were filed by independent collection agencies, in only one state, &quot;without knowledge of the company and against company policy.&quot; He said the retailer has taken &quot;immediate steps to ensure that it will not occur again.&quot;    The agreement is subject to public comment for 60 days, after which the agency will decide whether to make it final. </TEXT></DOC>
