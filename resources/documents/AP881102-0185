Waves of MiG-27s could be seen operating south of the cityMonday, and guerrillas reported heavy bombing earlier at theirpositions several miles east of the airport.   Guerrilla leaders and the U.S. State Department said last weekthat MiG-27s had been seen in Afghanistan, and Washington warned theSoviets about escalating the war.   The State Department also said Tuesday that Scud missiles capableof reaching Pakistan, 120 miles away, had appeared in Kabul,Afghanistan's capital.   Kabul radio said the missiles were to be used late Tuesday butdid not say where.   In Moscow, the Soviet news agency Tass said Afghan governmentforces fired a ``powerful missile'' at a guerrilla base near thePakistan border. Maj. Gen. M.Z. Sulemal was quoted as saying thetarget was a store of anti-aircraft missiles, ground-to-groundmissiles, mines and shells near Marulgad in Nangarhar province.   A spokesman for Pakistan's Foreign Ministry said Wednesday: ``Theintroduction of SS-1 Scud missiles in Afghanistan is a seriousviolation of the Geneva accords (and) represents a new and gravethreat to peace and security of the region.''   Under a U.N.-mediated agreement signed April 14 in Geneva, theSoviet Union is to withdraw all its troops from Afghanistan by Feb.5, 1989.   Moslem insurgents began fighting in Afghanistan after a Communistcoup in April 1978 and the Red Army entered the country in December1979. An estimated 115,000 Soviet military personnel were inAfghanistan the Geneva agreement was signed.   Half the Soviet soldiers are gone, but U.N. observers assigned tomonitor the agreement said the latest developments cast doubt onMoscow's commitment to complete the withdrawal.   Officials in Kabul call the Scud missiles the latest addition totheir arsenal, but guerrillas previously have described long-rangemissiles resembling Scuds.   Soviet-made Frog missiles with a shorter range of 30 miles werereported in Barikot, a northeastern garrison town after guerrillascaptured it last summer.   Fighting at Kandahar has been heaviest around the airport, about12 miles from downtown. Guerrillas said the first MiG-27 attacksoccurred Oct. 24-27 on their positions east of the airport near TorKotan village.   A guerrilla source in Quetta, Pakistan, said the aircraft werefirst spotted about Oct. 19 at a Soviet-Afghan air base at Shindandin western Afghanistan.   Insurgents in the area also reported seeing new helicoptergunships that were smaller, faster and more maneuverable thanearlier models but could not identify the type, the source said.   Those gunships covered roads connecting Kandahar to Kabul andHerat during the last week in October, said Ismail Galaini of theNational Islamic Front of Afghanistan guerrilla group.</TEXT></DOC>
