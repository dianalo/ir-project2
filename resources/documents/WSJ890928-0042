The bids were in the form of work expenditure commitments. The area is near three oil fields including the large Hibernia field. The auction was conducted by the Canada-Newfoundland Offshore Petroleum Board, a joint federal and provincial regulatory agency.    Successful bidders were Cygnus Mineral Corp., a closely held Canadian concern; Petro-Canada Inc., a Canadian government agency; Shell Canada Ltd.; two Canadian units of British Petroleum Co.; and a consortium of companies including Esso Resources Ltd., Bow Valley Industries Ltd., Shell Canada Ltd. and Chevron Canada Resources Ltd.    Esso is a unit of Imperial Oil Ltd. which is 70%-owned by Exxon Corp., New York. Shell is about 71%-owned by the Anglo-Dutch Royal Dutch/Shell Group, and Chevron Canada is a unit of San Francisco-based Chevron Corp.    Last year, there were fewer bidders at a similar auction. &quot;I'm pleasantly surprised&quot; with this year's auction, said Newfoundland Energy Minister Rex Gibbons.    Drilling on Canada's east coast came to a standstill in May for the first time in more than a decade. But there are plans to resume drilling next year, and Mr. Gibbons said there may be as many as five wells drilled in the next three years as a result of the auction.    Gerry Angevine, president of the Canadian Energy Research Institute, said interest in exploration is being spurred by plans to develop the Hibernia field. Hibernia is expected to produce 110,000 barrels of crude oil a day starting in 1996.    Industry analysts are also predicting a good response to a planned offering of exploration rights in the Beaufort Sea, the first auction in the Canadian Arctic in 20 years. </TEXT></DOC>
