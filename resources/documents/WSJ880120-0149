Ending three days of talks with German officials in Bonn, the Soviet official said an upgrading of short-range missiles could &quot;scuttle everything that has been achieved in the sphere of nuclear arms control and set us back a long way. It must not be allowed.&quot; Mr. Shevardnadze, repeating a proposal made earlier in his visit, said Moscow is prepared to dismantle all short-range nuclear missiles.    By speaking out strongly on short-range missiles, Mr. Shevardnadze picked on a sensitive issue among Germans and one that may become divisive within NATO. The U.S.-Soviet arms accord signed last month provides for the removal from Europe of land-based nuclear missiles with a range of more than 300 miles. It excludes nuclear missiles with a range of less than 300 miles.    NATO has said it doesn't want to negotiate away the short-range category because the missiles are needed to counter Warsaw Pact superiority in conventional arms. Addressing those concerns during his visit, Mr. Shevardnadze also said Moscow is prepared to negotiate a reduction in conventional forces.    &quot;The Soviets obviously want to make it as difficult as possible for NATO to carry out its modernization,&quot; said one Western diplomat in Bonn. A senior NATO diplomat accused the Soviets of trying to &quot;seduce the Germans away from us. It is none-too-subtle wedge-driving,&quot; he told Reuters. </TEXT></DOC>
