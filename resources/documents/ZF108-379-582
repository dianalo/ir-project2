 Clients accept your fees and give youassignments.andP;  You do the work.andP;  Whaths wrong with this picture?andP;  Where's themoney?andP;  A sale isn't a sale until you've received payment.andP;  This month:credit, billing, and collection procedures.andM;Business researchers have discovered three situations where getting paid isleft too much to chance: 1) Operations-oriented managers giving insufficientattention to business matters.andP;  2) Small firms easily intimidated andmanipulated by larger clients.andP;  3) People mostly selling their time who arelax about billing.andP;  Sound familiar?andP;  I've just described typical computerconsulting, development, and value-added reselling firms.andM;When you're absorbed by the challenges of your work--especially if you enjoythem--it's all too easy to forget other aspects of business management.andP;  Andtalking about money with clients is, well, uncomfortable.andP;  When your clientis larger or more sophisticated, you're at a power disadvantage.andP;  The clienthas cash-flow management goals, self-serving purchase order terms, and slicknegotiating skills.andP;  The all-too-common casual approach to billing probablyreflects the relatively low risk involved when all you sell is your time.andO;It's not like you actually have anything to lose, is it?andP;  Though the reasonsare understandable, bad financial management is a shortcut to going out ofbusiness.andP;  If you don't get paid for the last job, how can you afford to dothe work for the next one?andM;The first rule of financial management is this: Devise a policy and stick toit.andP;  Second rule: Alter your policy only if it really is in your bestinterest.andP;  Third rule: When in doubt, see the first rule.andM;Here are some methods used by consultants to assure financial survival.andP;  Yourfinancial policy must be based on your situation.andM;Financial policiesandM;Clients hate surprises.andP;  Always quote your rates, minimums, and terms beforethe actual work begins.andP;  Put it in writing.andP;  If circumstances justify, don'thesitate to push for better rates and terms.andP;  There's no such thing as asuccessful business person who doesn't get paid for full value provided.andO;When your value goes up, so should your pay.andM;Many VARs ask for a significant payment up front.andP;  For small jobs you mightask for your full estimate; for larger or on-going projects, you mightspecify periodic payments.andP;  &quot;To get started, we need a $1,000 reatiner.andO;We'll provide itemized billing monthly and request another payment whennecessary.andP;  And, of course, we'll refund any excess amount.&quot;andP;  The goal hereis to shift all risk to the client.andP;  In this scenario you don't have to worryabout getting paid, but the client may worry about getting results.andP;  Theclient also may fear that there won't be any excess refunded.andP;  This kind ofarrangement only works if you establish great trust (or if clients need youmore than you need them).andM;Another method, progressive billing, shares the risk.andP;  Agree on a triggerlevel, such as number of hours or dollars or days accrued, and insist ongetting paid for each segment of work done before continuing to the next.andP;  Ifthis method is used because the client lacks confidence in you, a problemwill arise if you can't demonstrate significant progress.andP;  Showing the clienttangible results just 10 hours into a 100-hours project might not be easy.andM;In situations where trust and respect are insufficient to come to anagreement, I walk away.andP;  There are too many quality clients to waste my time.andO;If you're more tolerant than me, consider having the client deposit fundswith an independent trustee in an escrow account.andP;  You'll be paid uponpresentation and approval of invoices.andP;  If the client approves your invoices,great.andP;  If not, you may have a fight on your hands.andM;The lower the trust level, the more contracts play a role.andP;  Top consultantsexpect to serve as and be treated like a client's attorney and accountant.andO;Companies rarely have a contract with these professionals.andP;  Instead, a letterof understanding spells out the basic relationship, fees, and terms.andP;  Acontract does the same thing, in more detail, with more enforceability, butin an adversarial style.andM;Credit, anyone?andM;Besides picking your clients carefully, the most important decision you makemay be whether to extend credit.andP;  Any time you start a job or purchase aproduct for a client without already having their payment, you're extendingthem credit.andP;  Any time you finish an assignment or deliver a product withoutreceiving payment in full, you're extending even more credit.andP;  The first ruleis, don't do this.andP;  The second rule is, when you have to, extend creditcarefully.andP;  The third rule is, have a deadbeat recovery plan.andP;  Credit is agable with a price tag.andP;  You're gambling that your client will actually payyou.andP;  And you're tying up your precious working capital while the client'sremains liquid.andM;Even when you believe the client will pay, you must be aware of the cost andrisk of extending credit.andP;  Any money in your own possession can (and should)be earning you money.andP;  Keep your cash in an interest-bearing checking accountor money market fund.andP;  At the least, use your cash to maintain a high enoughbank balance to eliminate bank charges.andP;  When you buy things for a client anddon't receive immediate reimbursement, your cash balance is reduced, so youforsake interest on your money.andP;  Your client, thankful that you're willing toextend credit, is probably earning additional interest on the same funds youhaven't yet collected.andP;  You lose; the client wins.andM;As the number of dollars outstanding increases, and the time span betweenexpenditure and collection increases, the time value of money becomessignificant.andP;  Say you're owed $10,000.andP;  Because you don't have the money, youcan't pay off your MasterCard balance, which charges 18 percent interest.andP;  Ifyour client takes just one month to pay, you have paid .015 times 10,000 or$150 to MasterCard that you wouldn't have had to pay otherwise.andP;  Or you couldhave earned $75 in a money market fund.andP;  Or you could have bought some hotstock just before it rose 50 percent.andP;  Meanwhile, your client has made thesame investments you couldn't.andP;  So the client is ahead by $75 or $150 ormore, at your expense.andM;Some clients will tell you credit is required.andP;  In some fields, extendingliberal credit is common practice.andP;  Anyone who doesn't is at a competitivedisadvantage.andP;  However, credit is not a common practice in the computerfield.andP;  Your client may not know this, and may assume that your terms iwll bethe same as their other vendors.andP;  You must be very clear about payment termsand be prepared to explain why your business and the computer industry aredifferent from other suppliers.andM;State your termsandM;Though payment terms can vary and might be negotiable, you should establishspecific terms and qualifications.andP;  Typical terms include:andM;* PrepaymentandM;* 80 percent down, balance CODandM;* 50 percent in advance, net 30andM;* CODandM;* Net 15andM;* 2/10, net 10andM;* 1/10, net 20andM;Terms might also specify &quot;Cashier's Check&quot; or &quot;Company Check.&quot;andM;&quot;Prepayment&quot; and &quot;in advance&quot; specify money you'll receive before you beginwork.andP;  &quot;COD&quot; means Cash On Delivery, and means you receive payment when youhand over th eproduct or complete the service.andP;  Be sure you define what&quot;Delivery&quot; means.andP;  Is an application &quot;delivered&quot; when it's installed on theclient's computer, when post-installation debugging is completed, when theclient gets around to fully using it, or what?andP;  Don't leave this to chance oropinion.andM;&quot;Net&quot; refers to the number of days the client is given to pay your invoice infull.andP;  Keep this as short as possible, both to reduce your costs of funds andto increase your odds of collection.andP;  Collection experts say the odds ofcollecting decrease dramatically past 30 days.andP;  &quot;1/10, Net 20&quot; offers theclient the option to deduct one percent (or whatever you specify) if paymentis made within 10 days.andP;  If the client doesn't pay within 10 days, payment infull without any deduction is due within 30 days.andP;  The idea of the deductionis to give the client an incentive to pay you quickly, reducing your costsand risk.andP;  The incentive is bigger than it sounds, since you're offering theclient a substantial discount.andP;  The math is a bit complex, but &quot;1/10 Net 20&quot;saves the client about 36 percent annually.andP;  &quot;1/10 Net 30&quot; saves the client18 percent.andP;  &quot;2/10 Net 20&quot; is equivalent to 73 percent savings!andP;  (On a $100purchase the client saves $2 by paying 10 days early.andP;  Since there are 36.5such 10-day periods in a year, this is equivalent to $73 annual savings.)andO;You can offset some of this if you take the money the client pays 10 daysearly and invest it or use it to pay your suppliers who offer similardiscounts.andM;In practice, offering an early payment discount will rarely yield anythingbut lost revenue and strained relationships.andP;  Many companies routinely takelonger to pay than &quot;net&quot; terms allow.andP;  If you want their future business,you'll let them take advantage of you--they assume.andP;  This is hard enough tocontrol.andP;  If you also specify a discount, some of these slow-paying firmswill not pay on time and they'll take the additional discount anyway!andP;  (I'veseen government agencies and large companies take 60 days yet deduct a 2/10discount.)andP;  If you don't authorize any discount, clients may still payslowly, but at least they have no basis for reducing the payment amount.andM;You might want to specify acceptable forms of payment.andP;  A cashier's check,certified funds, or postal money order guarantees that the payment is good,because the funds are removed from the account when the check is issued.andP;  Acompany check or personal check is only good if sufficient funds are in theaccount when the check clears the client's bank a few days later.andP;  (By theway, a check collected by UPS for a COD shipment can take two to three weeksto get back to the shipper for deposit.)andM;It is better to receiveandM;A client of mine, a very wise consultant in another industry, says nothingshould be allowed to interfere with sending out invoices.andP;  Whether you billmonthly, twice a month, weekly, or at the end of each job, do it immediately.andO;Happiness is positive cash flow.andP;  You need more money coming in than goingout.andP;  That only happens when you collect, so get those bills out promptly.andO;If you do allow a client to pay you later for something you provide earlier,you have &quot;accounts receivable.&quot;andP;  Receivables are expensive in several ways.andO;You must have enough spare cash to fund your receivables, because you'll paymoney out well before you receive money in.andP;  You must have the time, skill,and funds necessary to track receivables and go about collecting.andP;  You musthave enough profit to survive an occasional deadbeat client.andM;It's extremely important to manage your receivables to assure that terms arecomplied with and payments are collected.andP;  The biggest contributor tosuccessful collection is speed.andP;  The day after a payment is due, call and askif a check has been mailed.andP;  Five days later, advise that no check has beenreceived, and ask if there is a problem.andP;  Unless you feel very good about theanswer (&quot;Ralph was sick, but he signed the checks yesterday, so you shouldhave it tomorrow...&quot;) ask if you can pick up a check today.andP;  Be prepared totake a firm stand and become a bit pushy.andP;  Threats aren't appropriate untilyou've exhausted other methods (suing is hardly ever worth the expense).andP;  Ifthe client acts like you should be willing to wait for payment (and you don'tagree), point out that you did what you promised and you expect the same inreturn.andP;  If the client claims not to have the money, mention that you're nota bank.andP;  By extending payment, you're loaning money to the client.andP;  Sinceyou're not a bank, suggest that the client contact one, because you expectyour payment immediately.andM;Ace up your sleeveandM;Some VARs and developers try to enforce collection by withholding somethingvaluable--source code, key documentation, master disks, or warrantypaperwork--until payment is received.andP;  (When you have your car repaired, youdon't get the key back until you've paid, right?)andP;  It isn't a good idea toimpede the client's ability to use what you've delivered, since they canclaim you didn't complete the job.andP;  But retaining something the client valuesbut doesn't need immediately can be smart, as long as you don't do anythingillegal.andP;  Even a &quot;time bomb&quot; to disable software is legitimate, thoughperhaps undiplomatic (do not destroy anyone's data!).andP;  The best approach isto disclose as part of your terms exactly what it is that will be retained,and what the client has to do to get it from you.andP;  Then, when payment isreceived, be very prompt in providing the missing item, and get a receipt.andM;Get paid--you deserve itandM;If you have a job and go to work and don't get fired, you have every reasonto expect a paycheck.andP;  When you work for others as a consultant, developer,or VAR, don't settle for anything less.andP;  Some people are sharks who takeperverse pleasure in squeezing more than they're due out of others,especially out of suppliers.andP;  My defense is to pick my clients verycarefully, make them feel like we're made for each other, give them the bestpossible service, and show no mercy if they try to take advantage of me.andO;There are plenty of great companies out there.andP;  Enjoy them.andM;John L.
