Fully automated, small-sized river power plantsfeaturing an appropriate design may contribute substantially to our energysupply. The chain of power plants 'Mittlere Salzach' (Austria) and theUrreiting power plant (one of the sectional stations) are used to demonstratethe barrage layout, power plant designs, power plant components, automationand control issues and the technology applied.</TEXT></DOC>
