Through much of the 1980s, Filofax's bulging, monogrammed appointment books were mandatory fashion accessories for young, wealthy climbers in London's financial district. Along with Mont Blanc pens and cellular phones, $180-and-up Filofaxes have also caught on with the flaunt-your-wealth crowd in Manhattan, Los Angeles and Tokyo.    But in Britain, at least, the bubble has burst. The 68-year-old Filofax company, based in a London suburb, reported a #554,000 ($875,000) pretax loss in the first half -- a near-complete reversal of its #571,000 pretax profit a year earlier. Its sales slid 19% to #4.4 million from #5.5 million. The bottom line: a net loss of #519,000, compared with an earlier profit of #358,000. Worse, &quot;a very disappointing trading result&quot; was forecast for the entire year.    The crumpled profit, after a year of stagnant earnings in 1988, follows that day marked in black in most London yuppies' Filofaxes: Oct. 19, 1987, the day the stock market crashed. Since, London sales of Porsches, chic loft apartments and other luxuries have wilted, as thousands of once-rich young London brokers, research analysts and bankers have found themselves out of jobs. But Filofax officials -- who always denied the yuppie label -- insist their problems aren't related to the crash.    &quot;I doubt you could say more than 5% of our users are yuppies&quot; in Britain, bristled David Collischon, Filofax chairman, when questioned about the sales slump. He allows that U.S. sales, accounting for about 12% of Filofax revenue last year and growing this year at a brisk 25% rate, are &quot;much more oriented towards fashion&quot; than in Britain. He blamed the British sales slump primarily on high interest rates and reduced consumer spending. He called those temporary problems, to be overcome a new strategy.    The once-stodgy Filofax is taking a page out of other marketers' books. Eschewing its understated strategy of selling primarily by word-of-mouth, Filofax this year plans its first, big-budget advertising campaign. It's also diversifying: This year, it launched a pocket Filofax and a desk-top Filofax. It's even planning a promotional gimmick -- for a limited time, buyers of its #65 Winchester model can get two round-trip air-tickets to the U.S., provided they also buy a package holiday with a designated travel agency.    &quot;We're going through a difficult time,&quot; Mr. Collischon said, &quot;but I have tremendous faith in the future of the company.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
