<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-21-0079 </DOCNO><TEXT>The effects of radiation on performance are determined for both n/sup+/p and P/sup +/n GaAs and InP cells and for silicon n/sup +/p cells.It is found that the radiation resistance of InP is greater than thatof both GaAs and Si under 1 MeV electron irradiation. For silicon, theobserved decreased radiation resistance with decreased resistivity isattributed to the presence of a radiation induced boron-oxygen defect.Comparison of radiation damage in both p/sup +/n and n/sup +/p GaAs cellsyields a decreased radiation resistance for the n/sup +/p cell attributableto increased series resistance, decreased shunt resistance, and relativelygreater losses in the cell's p-region. For InP, the n/sup +/p configurationis found to have greater radiation resistance than the p/sup +/n cell.Temperature dependency results are interpreted using a theoretical relationfor dVoc/dT which predicts that increased Voc should result in decreasednumerical values for dPm/dT. The predicted correlation is observed forGaAs but not for InP a result which is attributed to variations in cellprocessing.</TEXT></DOC>
