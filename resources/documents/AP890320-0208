Ninety-one people were charged in 27 separate federalindictments, unsealed Monday, with manufacture and distribution ofmethamphetamine, an illegal stimulant known as ``speed,'' ``meth''or ``crystal.''   In addition, 29 methamphetamine labs were seized, state AttorneyGeneral John Van de Kamp said.   Philip Donohue Jr., agent in charge of the local office of thestate Bureau of Narcotic Enforcement, said 78 people were in custodyand authorities had seized about 20 pounds of methamphetamine and atleast 38 weapons, including combat assault rifles and one Uzisubmachine gun.   The first arrests came Sunday as 350 officers from several lawenforcement agencies made sweeps of homes in San Diego, OrangeCounty and Mammoth Lakes in the Sierra Nevada. More arrests wereplanned, Donohue said.   The sting involved the placement of an undercover state agentinside a legitimate retail chemical supplier, Triple Neck ScientificCo. of San Diego, with the owner's consent.   Starting last June, the agent made contact with customers buyingchemicals and equipment for making methamphetamine and other illegaldrugs, said Van de Kamp.   Methamphetamine makers in San Diego aren't limited to the``traditional subculture of outlaw motorcycle gangs,'' the attorneygeneral said.   ``Only half those arrested in this operation fit thatdescription. Among the other half, we had people like a retiredpharmacist, and a registered nurse. ... We found whole familiesinvolved in the drug trade,'' he said.   ``This gigantic sting will deal a body blow to themethamphatamine trade in San Diego,'' Van de Kamp added.   Donohue said San Diego ``has the dubious distinction of being themeth capital of the United States.''   Nearly half of the illegal methamphetamine labs in the UnitedStates are located in California, and San Diego County has led thenation in the number of labs seized for each of the past five years,according to federal figures.</TEXT></DOC>
