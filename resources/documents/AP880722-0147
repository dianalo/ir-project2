After years of strife, peace may be coming to southwesternAfrica, and to the Persian Gulf and Cambodia, as well.   Wars are still being waged all over the world, of course, andCentral America and the Middle East pose intractable problems.   But symbolic of the turnabout, the Ayatollah Khomeini, who vowedin 1982 ``we will not make peace,'' said this week he was takingthe advice of high-ranking political and military experts andaccepting a cease-fire with Iraq, even though ``it would have beenmore bearable to accept death and martyrdom.''   In Southeast Asia, a promised withdrawal of Vietnamese troopsfrom Cambodia is bound to lower tensions, and there is a morepromising reversal, too.   The Soviet Union, after saying for years what Vietnam did inCambodia was Vietnam's business, suddenly has agreed to discuss asettlement with China.   A successful meeting next month could clear the way for aSino-Soviet summit, propelling the world's two Communist giantsinto a spiritual embrace.   There is no sign yet of peace in Central America. Once again,the State Department stiff-armed a request this week by NicaraguanPresident Daniel Ortega for a high-level meeting. Instead,department officials invited Ortega to talk to the Contra rebelswho are trying to oust him from office.   Secretary of State George P. Shultz will huddle Aug. 1 with theleaders of Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras inGuatemala City on ways to build up pressure on Ortega.   The Middle East isn't very peaceful either. Violence on the WestBank is rising, and while Shultz is making plans for his fifthpeacemaking veture to the region so far this year, the odds arelong that he can persuade King Hussein of Jordan and Prime MinisterYitzhak Shamir of Israel to enter negotiations under conditions setin Washington.   But in contrast to the usual gloomy news this has been a week ofdramatic peacemaking.   Look at Africa.   The agreement announced by South Africa, Angola and Cuba wouldproduce two long-elusive results: the withdrawal of up to 50,000Cuban troops from Angola and the creation of an independent Namibiaafter 73 years of South African rule.   The plan brokered by Assistant Secretary of State ChesterCrocker also could lead to an early withdrawal of South Africantroops from southern Angola.   Crocker, the hard-working, former academic, took heat from bothleft and right through the years. He was accused on the one hand ofnot applying enough pressure on Pretoria and on the other offavoring anti-Western black forces at the expense of the whiteregime.   Crocker has labored through months of negotiations in London,Cairo and on Governor`s Island in New York Harbor. He knows howpeace dreams can fall apart. So he cautioned on Wednesday thatthere was ``hard bargaining'' ahead on such issues as drafting thetext of treaties and a Cuban withdrawal timetable.   Moreover, even if the agreement holds, the 13-year Angolan civilwar is not coming to an end. The United States will maintain itssupport for guerrillas led by Jonas Savimbi who are at war with theMarxist government in Luanda. Savimbi's UNITA rebels have received$15 million in U.S. military aid since 1986.   But the big picture is rosier. ``We have traveled a longdistance to get to this stage,'' South African Foreign MinisterRoelof F. Botha said of the three-nation agreement.   The next round of negotiations is set for Geneva on Aug. 2.While Botha cautioned that the road ahead was ``steep and full ofpotholes and dangerous curves,'' an unprecedented expectation ofsuccess has enveloped the State Department   Officials who work at and worry over the Persian Gulf arekeeping their fingers crossed. They know the war between Iran andIraq could not be settled on the battlefield or through a UnitedNations arms embargo. The fighting has see-sawed for eight years.The Soviets will not allow an embargo to clear the Security Council.   So all the U.S. chips are on Secretary-General Javier Perez deCuellar's effort to nail down the cease-fire Iran suddenly agreedto after a year of vacillation.   ``It opens the way to an end to the eight-year tragic war andrestoration of stability in a troubled area of the world,'' saidMarlin Fitzwater, the White House press secretary.   To which U.S. officialdom murmured a prayerful ``Amen.''</TEXT><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE><TEXT>   Barry Schweid has covered diplomatic affairs inWashington for the AP for the last 15 years.</TEXT></DOC>
