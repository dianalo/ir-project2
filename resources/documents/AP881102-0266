Democratic nominee Michael Dukakis, who cannot match his rival'sexperience, instead attacks Bush's judgment and challenges theadministration's right to claim any credit for the Soviet withdrawalfrom Afghanistan or the end of the Iran-Iraq war.   Dukakis supports the negotiated ban on medium-range nuclearmissiles and endorses the goal of a 50 percent reduction inlong-range missiles in U.S.-Soviet talks at Geneva. But heattributes the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces treaty to Sovietleader Mikhail S. Gorbachev's recognition of his country's economicfailures, not to President Reagan's military buildup and get-toughstance toward the Soviets.   Both presidential candidates would be certain to press ahead witharms control talks and try to build on the momentum achieved in thefour Reagan-Gorbachev summits.   Although Dukakis has accused the Reagan administration ofmishandling Middle East policy and waiting until the twilight of itsterm to seek a breakthrough there, neither Dukakis nor Bush hasspelled out any major initiatives to bring the Arabs and Israelistogether.   Both have assured Israel of continued U.S. support. Dukakis hasendorsed shifting the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, amove that administration officials fear could undermine progresstoward an Arab-Israeli settlement.   But in such troublespots as Nicaragua and South Africa, Dukakisis committed to changing the policies adopted by Reagan andchampioned by Bush.   Bush supports renewed aid to the Contra rebels in Nicaragua.Dukakis calls Reagan's Central American policies ``a fiasco'' andvehemently opposes Contra aid, favoring instead the diplomatic peaceplan of Costa Rican President Oscar Arias.   On South Africa, Dukakis promises to press for tougherinternational sanctions against the apartheid regime. Bush saysfurther sanctions would only hurt black workers. Dukakis alsoopposes U.S. aid for the South African-backed rebels in Angola,while Bush supports it.   The Democratic nominee says the United States should work withits allies and through international organizations rather than go italone. He has said the NATO allies and Japan must bear a largershare of the common defense.   Bush, a former ambassador to the United Nations, says, ``You'vegot to understand that it is only the United States that can standfor freedom and democracy around the world, and we can't turn itover to the United Nations or other multilateral organizations.''   Bush cites the INF treaty, the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistanand the tentative end of the Iran-Iraq war as vindication of theadministration's ``peace through strength'' philosophy.   For the vice president, that means pressing ahead withdevelopment and eventual deployment of Star Wars, or the StrategicDefense Initiative, which Dukakis once ridiculed as a fantasy.   It also means pounding Dukakis for opposing both the mobile MXand Midgetman missiles. ``The Soviets are modernizing. They continueto modernize. And we can't simply say, `We've got enough nuclearweapons. Let's freeze,''' Bush said.   Dukakis favored a nuclear freeze in the early 1980s when theReagan administration persuaded nervous allies in Western Europe toaccept Pershing II and cruise missiles to counter the Soviet's ownmedium-range weapons.   The governor has said the 13,000 nuclear weapons in the U.S.arsenal and the 9,000 stockpiled by the Soviets are enough to bloweach country up ``40 times over.''   But Dukakis supports the Stealth or B-2 bomber, which rolls offthe assembly line in late November, and backs the new generation ofnuclear missiles for the Trident submarine.   Bush has said his approach toward the Soviet Union ``would avoidswings between unjustified euphoria and exaggerated pessimism.''Dukakis speaks of trying to ``drive the agenda with the SovietUnion'' instead of following Gorbachev's lead.   Bush has visited 74 foreign countries as vice president. He wasenvoy to China and director of central intelligence as well asambassador to the United Nations.   ``I don't think we should risk turning over the leadership andsecurity of this free world of ours to a man with literally noexperience in foreign affairs,'' Bush recently told voters in SouthRiver, N.J.   ``It's not the length of your resume,'' counters Dukakis. ``It'syour strength, it's your values, the quality of the people you pick.It's your understanding of the forces of change in a sweeping newworld.''   Dukakis has questioned Bush's judgment in not trying to block thearms-for-hostages deal with Iran. He says Bush must share the blamefor dealing with Panamana's military leader, Manuel Noriega, nowunder indictment for alleged involvement in drug trafficking. Hecriticized Bush for once toasting then-Philippine PresidentFerdinand Marcos for ``your adherence to democratic principles.''   Dukakis supports a mutual ban on testing and deployment ofanti-satellite weapons and a prohibition of all underground nucleartests.   Bush supports the administration's controversial, broadinterpretation of the Anti-Ballistic Missile or ABM treaty, a moveintended to leave room for testing Star Wars. Dukakis favors theoriginal, narrow interpretation.   Bush says he wants the world to adopt and enforce a total ban onchemical and biological weapons. Dukakis scoffs at that, saying thatBush cast tie-breaking Senate votes in favor of resuming productionof chemical weapons.   Bush has accused Dukakis of opposing the U.S. invasion of Grenadain 1983 and the 1986 strike against Libya. The Democrat denies thecharge.   Dukakis hedged his support on both occasions. He said the Grenadainvasion was justified if the lives of American students were atstake, and the Libyan raid was proper if its aim was to hitterrorist bases and not to assassinate Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Release Anytime</NOTE></DOC>
