The stakes? No less than the multibillion-dollar Hilton Hotels Corp. hotel and casino empire built by the legendary Conrad Hilton and expanded immensely since 1966, when his son Barron became chief executive. Last week, after months of rumors, the company officially put itself on the block. The move has created no end of mystery among investors. After all, Barron Hilton just finished a grueling, 10-year fight over his father's estate, finally gaining full control of the company last May. Why, then, would the 61-year-old major Hilton stockholder sell off the family jewels for mere money?    Even to his circle of hunting and card-playing buddies, Mr. Hilton is something of an enigma -- predictable, perhaps, only in his dedication to what he perceives as his father's wishes. When Conrad Hilton died in 1979 and left his 28% stake in Hilton Hotels to charity -- not his children -- Barron insisted, and eventually convinced a court, that his father really wanted Hilton to stay in family hands first, and benefit charity second.    So it is that, in an interview Friday, his first in months, Mr. Hilton again invoked his father's name: Dad, he says, would be considering a sale, too.    &quot;My father was a businessman, and if it was in the interest of his shareholders, he was interested in negotiating a deal,&quot; Mr. Hilton says, his deliberate speech tinged with a Texas accent. &quot;. . . I like to feel I approach transactions the same way he would have.&quot; In fact, he says, his father once considered selling Hilton Hotels to Harold Geneen, former chairman of ITT Corp., in 1967.    Considering the whopping prices investors are paying for hotel chains these days, and the growing interest casino properties are getting, it is easy to see why Mr. Hilton is taking bids. Recently, for example, Seibu/Saison Group of Japan paid $2.2 billion for Intercontinental Hotels, and Hong Kong's New World Development Co. agreed to buy Ramada Inc.'s hotels for $540 million -- prices far higher than industry estimates of the companies' values. Over a year ago, an unidentified Japanese investor informally offered $1 billion for one of Hilton's 50%-owned hotels, the Hawaiian Village. Hilton also has a network of more than 270 hotels bearing its well-known name and owns New York's Waldorf-Astoria.    Some securities analysts say Hilton could fetch $120 a share or more, giving the company a value exceeding $6 billion. A big chunk of that would fall to Barron Hilton: He owns or controls about 25% of the public company's shares.    This Barron Hilton, who senses that his properties now may bring top dollar in a world-wide auction, seems startlingly different from the man real estate entrepreneur Donald Trump dismisses merely as the inheritor of another man's achievements. Mr. Trump, who tangled with Mr. Hilton over the 1985 sale of an Atlantic City, N.J., casino, snipes that Mr. Hilton's stewardship at Hilton &quot;has nothing to do with merit. It's called birthright.&quot;    History tells a different story. In 1966, when Barron Hilton became chief executive officer, the company owned or leased 29,000 rooms and had a market value of about $60 million. But at the end of last week, Hilton's shares had closed on the New York Stock Exchange at $105.88 -- more than twice what they were selling for when rumors of a Hilton sale began brewing in January -- and Hilton's indicated value had jumped to $5.1 billion. The number of hotel rooms under the Hilton name at the end of last year: 95,500.    Until now, the company has been associated primarily with its flamboyant founder, Conrad Nicholson Hilton, whose name became synonymous with hotels. &quot;Connie&quot; Hilton, born in New Mexico on Christmas day 1887 to a Norwegian immigrant father and a mother of German extraction, was a born deal maker. He scraped together a $20,000 down payment on his first hotel in Cisco, Texas, in 1919, lost much of his fledgling hotel chain during the Great Depression, then built, bought and sold properties in Texas through the 1930s.    A man of enormous energy, the senior Hilton had a decided taste not just for deal making, but for dancing and pretty women, too. He often appeared for breakfast at 8 a.m. after a night spent dancing until 2, and worked six days a week until shortly before his death in 1979.    In business, Conrad Hilton was a sharp real estate investor with an innate sense of a property's potential. Operations, though, he preferred leaving largely to subordinates. In his autobiography, &quot;Be My Guest,&quot; which is still left in Hilton hotel rooms, he says he bought the Waldorf-Astoria and Chicago's Palmer House after only brief inspections, relying on instinct instead.    Conrad Hilton was married three times, once to the actress Zsa Zsa Gabor. In contrast, the son born William Barron Hilton married his current wife, Marilyn, at age 18 after he served a World War II stint as a Navy photographer. In 1946, he turned down his father's offer of a job at $150 a month. Instead, he started up a fruit juice company called Vita-Pakt Citrus Products Co., in which he still holds an interest. He became involved in an oil company and several other businesses before finally joining Hilton Hotels in the late 1950s as a vice president.    At Hilton, he has had his share of missed calls. He helped develop the Carte Blanche credit-card company in the late 1950s, which racked up big losses and was later sold. He also helped his father engineer the sale of Hilton's profitable international hotels to Trans World Corp. in exchange for stock. Trans World stock soon plunged, while the hotels became quite lucrative.    But there were shrewd moves too. In 1974, Barron Hilton freed up large chunks of capital by selling off a 50% interest in six prize hotels to Prudential Insurance Co., reducing debt but continuing to manage the properties. This &quot;management-leaseback&quot; strategy has since become a standard practice in the hotel industry.    Without question, his master stroke was persuading his father and a reluctant board in the early 1970s to buy two Nevada casinos. Today, the two properties, the Las Vegas Hilton and Flamingo Hilton, are highly profitable. The company, meanwhile, has moved into the burgeoning Laughlin, Nev., casino market, while also enlarging its Reno, Nev., property.    A foray into the New Jersey gaming market, though, turned into disaster. In 1983, Hilton Hotels broke ground for the biggest project in the company's history -- a planned 2,000-room casino resort in the marina area of Atlantic City. Hilton, with its deep pockets and clean reputation, had been invited in by the governor and considered its licensing application little more than a formality. But New Jersey gaming regulators said they questioned the &quot;good character and integrity&quot; of certain company officials, particularly their relationship with a Chicago lawyer that law enforcement agencies said had ties to organized crime.    Just weeks away from the casino's opening, the New Jersey Casino Control Commission stunned the company by rejecting its licensing application. Insiders now concede a certain corporate arrogance may have alienated regulators. &quot;They didn't take the licensing process seriously, and they felt they were entitled to it,&quot; says one person familiar with the hearings. &quot;It killed them.&quot;    In the end, Hilton sold the casino resort to Mr. Trump.    When he died at age 91, Conrad Hilton believed that inherited wealth can morally corrupt one's heirs. So he left nearly all his fortune, including the big Hilton Hotels stake, to the Conrad N. Hilton Foundation, assigning it to charity, with certain conditions. For his part, Barron got $750,000 in stock.    &quot;There is a natural law, a Divine law, that obliges you and me to relieve the suffering, the distressed and the destitute,&quot; the elder Mr. Hilton wrote in the 33rd and last version of his will. &quot;Charity is a supreme virtue, and the great channel through which the mercy of God is passed on to mankind.&quot;    But, according to Barron Hilton, his father also had worried about the company falling into outside hands. Barron Hilton argued that a current tax law could indirectly aid a hostile takeover by forcing the foundation to sell the stock to outsiders -- something, he says, his father never intended to have happen. Mr. Hilton claimed his father's will granted him an option to buy the shares for about $165 million, their value at the time of Mr. Hilton's death.    The claim became the source of a series of lawsuits that eventually involved the Catholic Church and several orders of nuns, which stood to benefit as charities. On May 8, Mr. Hilton won control of the company in a settlement. He got four million shares outright and control of an additional six million as a trustee, making his total 25%, counting his previously held shares. The foundation retained 3.5 million shares and stands to reclaim the six million shares in the trust in 20 years or at Mr. Hilton's death, whichever comes later.    Until recently, Mr. Hilton had said he'd probably favor keeping the company under family control. In years past he had even hinted at a leveraged buy-out. No more.    &quot;We have the opportunity today to make a sale of the domestic company at what appear to be very attractive values,&quot; Mr. Hilton says.    At the moment, Hilton's New York financial advisers, Shearson Lehman Hutton and Eastdil Realty Inc., are reviewing potential buyers. Hilton says it has been swamped with calls from investors in Asia, Europe and the U.S. since Mr. Hilton told the May annual shareholders meeting that any legitimate bid would be considered. The company, however, won't say who specifically has expressed interest in buying Hilton.    There is the possibility, too, that only part of the company will get sold off. Hilton has said it might keep an interest in the casinos if a sale of the entire company can't be worked out easily. For one thing, the casinos present licensing hurdles to buyers. But, more importantly, they are cash machines. In 1988, they churned out about half the company's total net income of $130.9 million as well as about half its revenues of $953.6 million.    Wall Street observers say current tax laws also favor a sale now. And some old friends and colleagues speculate Mr. Hilton may simply be unable to see a future for family operation of the company after his departure. His son David heads casino operations at the Flamingo Hilton and son Steve sits on the board of his grandfather's foundation, but none of his eight children are likely to take the company's helm. His brother, Eric, has been content to keep a low profile while working in Hilton's international unit.    Indeed, &quot;there's no one in that company who can take Barron's place,&quot; contends Henri Lewin, who ran Hilton's Nevada casinos for 13 years and now runs the Sands hotel-casino in Las Vegas. &quot;If Hilton ever makes a big mistake, it's by Barron. If Hilton ever makes a great move, it's by Barron. Nothing is done without him.&quot;    What will Mr. Hilton do if he doesn't retain the casino business? He's not ready to retire, he says, and would probably end up spending much of his time with his father's foundation. &quot;If the entire company were to be sold, the total value of the foundation would be in the area of a billion dollars plus,&quot; he notes. &quot;That's something my father never would have dreamed of, probably.&quot; As for passing along his own wealth, Mr. Hilton says, &quot;I share my father's views on inheritance 100 percent&quot; -- which may bode well for charity, though perhaps not for family members.    Friends hint Mr. Hilton might be ready to trade corporate pressures for recreation, especially in light of his wife's frail health. When he's not at his estate in the posh Holmby Hills section of Los Angeles, friends say, he's happily crouching in a muddy duck blind at sun-up. He is said to be a crack shot, despite weak vision in one eye. Mr. Hilton's other passions include tending his 460,000-acre Nevada ranch and his own miniature Air Force -- including an acrobatic biplane, a Beechcraft Staggerwing, four gliders and a hot-air balloon.    &quot;Barron's kind of a man's man,&quot; says Wayne M. Hoffman, former chairman of Tiger International Inc. and a longtime flying companion and friend. &quot;He really has an abiding love for hunting, soaring and things like that, and he really doesn't care about the social circuit or the Fortune 500.&quot;    Mr. Hilton may also use any new wealth from a sale of Hilton Hotels to dabble in other businesses or perhaps buy a ball team, associates say. But those closest to him say his life style is unlikely to change even if a windfall does come his way.    &quot;He doesn't need any more new planes or new houses,&quot; says John Giovenco, head of the Hilton casino operations and a longtime associate. &quot;I doubt he'd live any differently at all.&quot;    ---@ Hilton's Growth @ Hilton Hotels Corp. 1986 1988 @ Revenue (in millions): $195.6 $953.6 @ Net profit from operations @ (in millions): $6.7 $243.7 @ Dividends per share: $.75 $.95 @ Working capital: @ (in millions) $13.1* $279.5* @ Long-term debt $151.5* $586.5** @ (in millions): @ Shareholders' equity @ (in millions): $112.6* $814.1** @ Shares outstanding @ (in millions): 3.4* 48.1** @ Total rooms: 29,000 95,488**    *At Dec. 31, 1966    **At Dec. 31, 1988 </TEXT></DOC>
