Total compensation for workers in private industry, including pay and benefits, increased 1.5% in the March quarter after rising 0.7% in the previous quarter. During the 12 months ended March 31, private industry employment costs rose 3.9%, following a 3.1% gain in the period a year earlier. Total compensation includes wages, salaries and most fringe benefits.    This marked the first time in the eight years the department has collected these statistics that March-to-March compensation cost increases in private industry topped those of the previous 12 months. They had been declining from a 1981 high of 10.7%.    The report, issued by the department's Bureau of Labor Statistics, reflects sizable gains in social-security costs, health insurance and lump-sum payments, which the BLS includes in its benefit calculations, noted Felicia Nathan, a BLS economist.    An earlier report by the bureau showed that employment costs in private industry rose 3.3% last year after a 3.2% gain in 1986; the increase in these costs had been shrinking each year since 1981, when they rose 9.8%.    The bureau also reported that wages of workers covered by labor contracts signed in the first three months of 1988 will rise an average 2.1% in the first year of the agreements. When these workers last negotiated collective bargaining pacts, generally two to three years ago, settlements resulted in first-year wage increases averaging 1.8%.    However, average wage increases over the life of the newest contracts were 2.3%, down from an average 2.5% when these workers last bargained new agreements.    While wage increases in private industry, averaging 1% in the first quarter, were modestly ahead of the 0.6% gain in the 1987 fourth quarter, benefit increases climbed 3.1%, compared with a 1% rise in the fourth period. In manufacturing, benefit gains were 4.4% for the first quarter, compared with a rise of 1.1% in the fourth.    As for wages, blue-collar worker increases have begun to catch up with those for white-collar employees, Ms. Nathan said. She suggested that &quot;the labor market (may be) getting tighter for those workers,&quot; helping to boost their wage increases.    Manufacturing workers' pay rose 0.8% in the first quarter, compared with a 1.1% rise in the 1987 fourth quarter. For nonmanufacturing jobs, there was a 0.9% rise, compared with a 0.4% increase.    For union members, wages and salaries rose 0.4% in the first quarter, compared with a 1.1% increase in the fourth period. Nonunion workers fared better, with a 1% increase in the first quarter, following a 0.5% gain in the previous quarter. In the 12 months ended March 31, wages and salaries for nonunion workers in private industry rose 3.5%, staying ahead of the 2.6% gain for union workers.    The bureau had earlier reported that collective bargaining agreements reached in 1987 called for wage increases matching those given when those workers last reached contract accords. That was the first time since 1982 that new pacts didn't involve lower average wage increases than the pacts they replaced. Settlements in 1986 were the smallest in the 20 years the department has kept the statistics.    None of the figures in the bureau's reports are seasonally adjusted. </TEXT></DOC>
