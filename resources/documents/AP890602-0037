ALLEN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A New Jersey senator is urging the federalgovernment to assess the impact on the environment _ at home andabroad _ when undertaking development projects, saying failure todo so goes against Bush administration claims.   ``The president seems unable to take the simple action ofordering federal agencies to consider this and other globalenvironmental issues in their impact statements,'' Sen. FrankLautenberg, D-N.J. said. ``This failure undercuts theadministration's claims to be moving aggressively and to be takinga leadership role in addressing the consequences of globalwarming.''   During a hearing Thursday on reauthorization of the NationalEnvironmental Policy Act, Lautenberg noted the Bush administrationwas failing to act on its stated intention to target worldwideenvironmental threats.   Lautenberg brought before his Superfund subcommittee tworeauthorization bills stepping up consideration of environmentalimpact when federal actions are involved.   The first bill, introduced earlier in the day by Lautenberg andSens. Dave Durenberger, R-Minn., and John Chafee, R-R.I., wouldstrengthen the power of the Council on Environmental Quality, abody that advises the president. The amended measure also wouldauthorize the council to issue regulations assuring environmentalimpact statements address such global issues as ozone depletion andthe greenhouse effect.   The second measure, introduced earlier in the session by Sen.Steven D. Symms, R-Idaho, would require multilateral banks, such asthe World Bank, to conduct environmental assessments beforeundertaking foreign projects.   A. Alan Hill, chairman of the Council on Environmental Quality,which advises the president on environmental matters, said he wasunsure whether the council should be responsible for actions onglobal warming.   ``I don't know if it's the best to deal off an issue to thecouncil,'' he said. ``It's up to the president to make one placethe coordinating body.''   Hill, who leaves his post in June after eight years, said hebelieved the United States should cooperate with other nations topress banks for environmental impact statements on foreigndevelopment projects, such as construction of dams.   ``If we stand up alone, our chances of success are less. If weall get together, it's the bigger wallet,'' he said.   Michael McCloskey, chairman of the Sierra Club, testified thatthe Council on Environmental Quality should be strengthened.   ``We believe it is urgent that the president revive CEQ, and wehope he will ask for the resources needed to rebuild its staff tobetween 40 and 50 people. We hope too that the Congress willprovide the funding for this.''   McCloskey said the council, which shrank in manpower and impactin the past decade, but should assume the lead role in devisinginitiatives for the president on global climate changes, ozone,forest losses, pollution and management of public lands.   However, Edwin L. Johnson, director of the developing countriesstaff for the Office of International Activities of theEnvironmental Protection Agency, objected to such requirements,which could be interpreted as outside interference from the UnitedStates.   He said some changes in the legislation ``leave the bill stillopen to criticism by the multilateral development banks andborrowing nations as a unilateral imposition of U.S. standards.''</TEXT></DOC>
