Are we to believe all that you tell us about sex?;   That for nearly 2,000 years, the Western world's foremost physicians andanatomists maintained there were not two sexes, but one? That female sexualorgans were really just male sexual organs turned outside-in?  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Living  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  O WOMAN/MANWESTERN SCIENCE USED TO SAY THAT THE DIFFERENCESBETWEEN MEN AND WOMEN WERE ONLY A MATTER OFDEGREE. NOW A BERKELEY HISTORIAN RETURNS TOTHOSE WRITINGS, SUGGESTING OUR BIOLOGICALAND SEXUAL DIFFERENCES MAY NOT BE AS IMPORTANTAS WE THINK  </HEADLINE><TEXT>     That we find this message in the writings of Galen of Pergamum, the Romanphysician who founded the science of anatomy and for nearly two millenia wasthe most influential medical writer in the West? Whose opinions on thissubject are mirrored in this bit of 19th-century doggerel, lifted from Page 4of your book:;    Though they of different sexes be,;    Yet on the whole theyare the same as we,;    For those that have the strictest searchers been,;   Find women are but men turned outside in.;    Finally, that you don't find allof this laughable?;    &quot;These guys were not dodos,&quot; you say?;    ThomasLaqueur, the University of California, Berkeley historian, is drinking tea onhis patio while his pet boxer, Curious, chases a cat by the back fence.;   Laqueur, 45, has written a book that gathers a tremendous volume of materialon a subject you thought was obvious -- penises and vaginas -- and makes yourealize it isn't obvious at all. The book, &quot;Making Sex: Body and Gender fromthe Greeks to Freud&quot; (Harvard University Press, $27.95), attacks thefundamental notion that we 20th-century brainiacs understand human bodies.;   Laqueur is not a crackpot. He knows there are incontrovertible differencesbetween men and women, including the fact that women give birth and men don't.But he argues that people have always looked at their bodies -- at so-calledbiological, sexual differences -- through a cultural veil.;    In effect, hetells us, we invent our own bodies. We make sexual differences as blurry ordistinct as we choose. The one-sex model fit its time -- people happened tobelieve for a long time that female bodies were slightly imperfect versions ofmale bodies. The two-sex model fits our own -- and we use science as a tool tomake it fit, he argues.;    But let's bypass the theory and go straight to adescription of how genitalia were imagined in antiquity. Continuing on Page4:;    &quot;In this world the vagina is imagined as an interior penis, the labiaas foreskin, the uterus as scrotum, and the ovaries as testicles. The learnedGalen could cite the dissections of the Alexandrian anatomist Herophilus, inthe third century B.C., to support his claim that a woman has testes. . . .much like the man's, one on each side of the uterus, the only difference beingthat the male's are contained in the scrotum and the female's are not.&quot;;   The book is filled with reproductions of medieval anatomical drawings of sexorgans. And you know something? These guys were on to something.;    &quot;Theseguys just thought of the body differently from us,&quot; Laqueur agrees. &quot;They drewit differently, they imagined it differently.&quot;;    It was not only Galen whopushed the one-sex model. There was Renaldus Columbus, for example, whoclaimed to have discovered the clitoris. And there was Ambroise Pare, personalphysician to two French kings, who promoted the once-popular notion that womenneeded to have orgasms in order to conceive.;    These notions were&quot;mish-mashed around&quot; in the popular press of the Renaissance -- the sex andhealth manuals that abounded then. Just like today.; (hbox);    Laqueur wasborn in Istanbul, Turkey, where his parents fled to escape persecution byHitler. His father, a pathologist, taught at a university there until Laqueurwas 4. Then the family moved to, of all places, a small coal-mining town inWest Virginia. Laqueur's father worked in a hospital owned by the United MineWorkers and Laqueur remembers spending Sundays in the laboratory.;    Laqueurwas interested in &quot;the sciences and history and philosophy. I was always biginto facts. I read the World Book in sixth grade and the teachers thought Iwas really maladjusted. They tried to make me go play on the playground. Iwasn't unathletic, but I was a bookish kid, I guess.&quot;;    He attendedSwarthmore College outside Philadelphia, then did graduate work in history atPrinceton and Oxford. In 1977, he &quot;was hanging around Oxford looking for aproject.&quot; He had just finished a book on Sunday schools in England between1780 and 1850, a time of high mortality when it was common for schoolchildrento attend the funerals of classmates.;    Laqueur thought it might beinteresting to do a book on the history of the life cycle -- how birth,puberty, marriage, death and so on had been experienced in other eras. Hebegan wading through Renaissance midwifery manuals to see how the birthingprocess had been organized; scraps of notes from this research became theseeds of his sex book.;    The project, it turned out, became tethered to thelife cycle of his own family. While doing early research in Oxford, he courtedhis wife through the mail. His letters to Gail Saliterman, now a lawyer,included bits of advice from Ambroise Pare, who advised husbands to &quot;cherish,embrace, and tickle&quot; their wives, and to &quot;creepe&quot; into the &quot;field of nature.&quot;He began the book in earnest around the time their daughter Hannah was bornand didn't complete it until she was 8 years old.;    In his research, Laqueurlearned that Aristotle used the same Greek word -- &quot;kaulos&quot; -- for penis andvagina. He was taken with the careers of Galen and his disciples. Theirone-sex model bolstered the idea that humanity occupied a particular positionin the organization of the cosmos -- and that women stood a step below men onthe ladder ascending to the firmament.;    Incidentally, women owed theirimperfection to a lack of heat -- a vital energy that, had they possessedenough of it, would have forced their bodies to extrude their sexual organslike men.;    Sounds ludicrous? While the two-sex model of the body shiftedslowly into favor in the 18th and 19th centuries, little was known about thefunction of the ovaries. Yet physicians came to identify the ovaries as themaster organs of the female body. In the 1870s, it became common for Europeanwomen to have healthy ovaries removed. This was seen as a &quot;cure,&quot; Laqueurtells us, for female &quot; 'behavioral pathologies': hysteria, excessive sexualdesires, and more mundane aches and pains whose origins could not be shown tolie elsewhere.&quot;;    Thousands of women underwent these &quot;female castrations. .. . The name itself,&quot; Laqueur writes, &quot;. . . suggests the old view that theovaries are female testicles, much like the males'.&quot; Removing the ovaries,then -- castrating the women -- would make them less man-like. On the otherhand, if the ovaries were truly the seat of femininity, removing them wouldmake the women less feminine and more man-like. There is a blurring of sexualdistinctions that lurks behind the procedure. To Laqueur, it is one of manyindications that the modern view of the body is less set in stone than wemight think.;    &quot;That blurry feeling you get from the book is what I wantedto convey,&quot; he says. &quot;. . . I'm more sympathetic personally to the one-sexmodel . . . 'cause I don't like this idea of set borders. I've never liked thesort of phallic authoritative aspects of being male -- because you have apenis you're supposed to be aggressive and exercise authority. So in a sensethis is a book by someone who was never really wildly happy with those sortsof associations of masculinity, anyway.;    &quot;Did you see 'L.A. Law' the othernight?&quot; he asks. &quot;One of the cases was one in which a woman was sellingcosmetics and they discovered that she's a transsexual and they fired her. Andthe grounds for firing her were that if anyone found out she wasn't really awoman, she wouldn't be able to sell the product. . . . And then the defensesaid, 'How can you be prejudiced against this person? She's a beautifulperson.' . . . And, yes, she was taking estrogen but so do women who've hadtheir ovaries removed. She looked to all the world like a woman. Peoplethought of her as a woman. She sounded like a woman. So when you push it tothe limit, it becomes blurrier and blurrier.;    &quot;I'm not denying differencesthat are empirically verifiable between so-called men and so-called women,&quot;Laqueur says, laughing. &quot;It's just that these terms have so much more baggageto them.;    &quot;If you were to test me and Magic Johnson -- I like to make thesesorts of provocative arguments -- I would say that Magic Johnson is moredifferent from me than I am from my wife. . . . I mean, yes, it's true she canbear children and I can't. But then neither of us can sort of sail through theair for 30 seconds and stay there. It's how you weight the question . . . wegive more weight to the sexual and not the other.;    &quot;The further you pushthe limits, the more ambiguous it becomes.&quot;  </TEXT><BYLINE>  RICHARD SCHEININ, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910507  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Tuesday  </DAY><MONTH>  May  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1D  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  1,573  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Tuesday May 7, 199100128006,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  0  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
