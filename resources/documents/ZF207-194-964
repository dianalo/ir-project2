Tobin Jr., the Navy's director of information resourcesmangement, is expected to release shortly a requirement for a standardhardware, software and telecommunications architecture for all bases andstations to use.andP;  The BASIS staff initially developed those standards, hesaid.andM;Tobin could not be reached immediately to confirm or deny that he wouldrelease the specifications.andM;By implementing the systems at the 10 sites, McRoberts said, BASIS officialsexpect to prove BASIS is viable.andP;  He said he hopes the MAISRC will thenreview the program again and approve its deployment.andM;The major goal of BASIS, a program of the Naval Data Automation Command(NAVDAC), was to build a heterogeneous database that would allow more than100 Navy bases and stations to share data.andP;  The system supports 14 managementfunctions including administration, port services and public works.andM;After the system is implemented, McRoberts said, NAVDAC will review theprogram and seek funding from within the Navy.andP;  He said the funding wouldhave to come from other Navy program budgets.andM;The system began in the early 1980s when Navy officials decided to automateadministrative tasks.andP;  They said BASIS would improve data reliability, speedup management report preparation and provide data access to a wider range ofusers.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
