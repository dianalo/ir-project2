Met Life, which owns about $240 million of RJR's oldbonds, filed suit in 1988 arguing that the buy-out hurt thevalue of the old bonds and broke pledges made to bondholders.Among the remedies sought by Met Life was early repayment ofthe bonds, some of which don't come due until 2016.</LP><TEXT>   A federal appeals court overturned a lower-court ruling towhich Met Life had objected. Met Life wants to start a 60-dayclock running in which RJR must cure the alleged default onits bonds or face a series of steps that bondholders cantake. RJR had asked a lower court to, in effect, freeze theclock until its claim can be heard that there hasn't been anydefault.   The lower court had granted RJR an open-ended injunction.But yesterday's appeals court ruling disallowed thatinjunction and directed the lower court to resumeproceedings.   A decisive verdict in the Met Life suit still is a longway off. Both sides are expected to file briefs with thefederal district court this summer. The district judge,Michael B. Mukasey, isn't expected to hear the case untilOctober and isn't expected to rule until early 1991. Whateverhis verdict, it's likely to be appealed, and that could takeanother 18 months or longer.</TEXT></DOC>
