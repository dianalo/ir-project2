Lange, who announced his resignation today amid a crisis withinhis Labor Party, had incurred the wrath of both the United Statesand France over his outspoken anti-nuclear views.   Born in Auckland in August 1942, Lange celebrated his 47thbirthday last Friday.   He became New Zealand's youngest prime minister this century andthe second youngest ever when he won the snap election called byhis National Party predecessor Robert Muldoon in July 1984.   Known for his oratorial skill, Lange governed through a time ofdramatic change for the South Pacific nation of 3.3 million.   Lange's Labor government put New Zealand on the map when itrefused to bow to two of the world's five nuclear powers.   During his government he proclaimed New Zealand nuclear-free,lost the support of the United States and took on France over thebombing of the Greenpeace ship Rainbow Warrior in Auckland Harbor.   He also rattled France with continued criticism of Frenchnuclear testing in the region.   Lange's political rise began in 1977 when he won the safe Laborseat of the northern town of Mangere outside Auckland during aby-election. Two years later he became the deputy leader of theLabor Party under leader Bill Rowling.   In 1983 he was elected Labor leader and 16 months later led histraditionally left-leaning party to victory.   During Labor's first term Lange's finance minister, RogerDouglas, proceeded with measures previously unseen in New Zealand.Farm and export subsidies were removed, the dollar floated, tariffsreduced or phased out and six of the government's biggest tradingdepartments turned into corporations, causing the loss of thousandsof jobs.   Lange's government was re-elected in 1977 and immediately cracksbegan to appear in the Lange-Douglas relationship.   In December 1987 Douglas announced plans for a flat rate ofincome tax, a guaranteed minimum family income scheme and proposalsto make the well-off pay for health and education services.   Lange denounced the proposals, setting off a cold war between heand the Douglas camp.   Douglas resigned his post late last year but was re-appointed tothe Cabinet last week, a decision that angered Lange.   Despite the ongoing rift and the re-emergence of Douglas, whichpolitical observers are citing as the true reason for Lange'sresignation, the former finance minister offered praise for Langetoday.   In a statement issued in Wellington, Douglas said Lange led NewZealand with ``extraordinary distinction through the most difficultperiod of its post-war history.''   ``No Labor government since World War II has accomplished morethan this Labor government under his leadership,'' said Douglas.   A Methodist lay-preacher and teetotaler, Lange spurned thetrappings of official life by not moving into the officialWellington residence of Vogel House.   Instead, he rented a small apartment across the road while hisEnglish-born wife Naomi and their three children maintained amodest home in Auckland.   Citing poor health as one of the reasons for his decision toresign, Lange was treated in hospital last year for a heartcondition and in 1983 underwent a stomach stapling operation in asuccessful attempt to lose weight.</TEXT></DOC>
