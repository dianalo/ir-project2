Apcar (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> FRB GOVMT </CO><IN> BNK </IN><DATELINE> DALLAS  </DATELINE><TEXT>   First RepublicBank Corp., Texas's largest independent banking concern, is weighing whether to seek U.S. aid to avoid the potential failure of its flagship bank here and of some of its other banks.    At a regularly scheduled meeting today, according to federal regulators and First RepublicBank officials, the company's directors are expected to consider whether it should formally ask the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. for what could be one of the largest bank rescues in history.    A spokesman for First RepublicBank confirmed yesterday that its board plans to meet today, but declined to comment on what would be discussed.    First RepublicBank, which isn't related to San Francisco-based First Republic Bancorp, is swamped with billions of dollars in bad real estate and commercial loans. The once smugly confident company has seen its condition deteriorate in recent weeks as uneasy depositors and customers have fled its banks.    In five days last month, the Dallas bank's deposits shrank by a stunning $600 million, and there have been signs of depositor runs at some of First RepublicBank's other banks. This year, First RepublicBank internally forecasts a $450 million loss -- unless drastic cost cutting takes place. That loss would be on top of a record $656.3 million loss last year.    A government bailout would be hard to swallow at any big Texas bank, but especially so at First RepublicBank. Last year, it acquired InterFirst Corp. -- a large and troubled crosstown rival -- and confidently set about a risky plan to remain independent. As recently as last month, First RepublicBank executives predicted publicly that they would successfully navigate the state's banking crisis.    But last week, Gerald W. Fronterhouse, First RepublicBank's chairman and chief executive officer, met privately with two investment banking firms in an effort to get a big infusion of capital that would be a prerequisite for any FDIC aid. And one top executive confided, &quot;We will be lucky to survive&quot; without a federal rescue.    To get the FDIC assistance, First RepublicBank might be required to raise as much as several billion dollars. That would be a tall order to fill, investment bankers said. &quot;I'm just not sure there's an appetite&quot; for Texas bank investments now, said one. &quot;I think they'd have a lot of trouble raising a couple of billion dollars.&quot;    The full board may decide to hold off asking for assistance, however, depending on its latest assessment of First RepublicBank's financial condition and on how large a first-quarter loss is expected. The scheduled meeting follows two hastily called sessions last week of the board's executive committee, which examined alternatives for the company's troubled banks and recommended that the full board decide whether to seek U.S. aid.    Generally, &quot;open bank&quot; assistance is granted only if the FDIC determines that keeping a bank open would be less costly to the government than letting the bank fail and auctioning or liquidating it. An FDIC bailout of the type envisioned by First RepublicBank would still require regulators to certify that the bank is in danger of failing, and losses to existing First RepublicBank shareholders could be similar to a bank failure. The FDIC also has the option of making management changes.    So far this year, the FDIC said it has aided six banks. Last year, the agency agreed to assist 19 banks, including two large Texas banking concerns, BancTexas Group Inc., Dallas, and First City Bancorp. of Texas, Houston. The First City accord has hit some snags, but the bank is pressing to complete its rescue by the end of the month.    It isn't clear exactly what form of &quot;open bank&quot; assistance First RepublicBank could seek. One approach, similar to the pending First City bailout, would be to create a separate bank of bad loans that would be capitalized by a portion of First RepublicBank's remaining capital and owned by existing shareholders who would share in the collection and liquidation of the sour loans. The FDIC and new First RepublicBank investors could then recapitalize the &quot;good&quot; bank.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, First RepublicBank shares closed at $1.75, up 12.5 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
