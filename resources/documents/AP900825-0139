KNUTSON</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Efforts to help Americans trapped in Kuwaitand Iraq and provide information to family members in the UnitedStates have largely boiled down to trying to improve morale, theState Department said Friday.   The information offered to families is generally limited becauseof the nature of the situation, the department said, adding thereis no information on the whereabouts of Americans rounded up by theIraqis and detained.   ``I think the American community in Iraq and Kuwait is verytense, concerned,'' said Nicholas Ricciuti, director of theCitizens Emergency Center of the department's consular section.   ``I think morale is probably the most practical purpose'' of theState Department communication effort, he said.   However, Ricciuti said the department had provided repatriationmoney and emergency loans.   ``We assist the Americans any way that we can,'' he said.   At a briefing, Ricciuti said more than 25,000 phone calls hadbeen received by the Kuwait Task Force since the Aug. 2 Iraqiinvasion inquiring about the well being of Americans in the twonations.   The task force, staffed by more than 100 people in three shifts,24 hours a day, has made more than 10,000 calls to families andfriends to relay information, Ricciuti said.   The State Department says there are about 2,500 Americans inKuwait, of whom 1,984 have been identified by the U.S. Embassy.There are some 500 Americans in Iraq.   Gathering information has become difficult because of restraintsplaced on U.S. diplomats in the two countries and because of thebelief that Iraq is monitoring telephone calls to learn thelocations of Americans, Ricciuti said.   He said calls are kept short.   ``We never say where they have moved for obvious reasons,'' hesaid. ``We have been able to pass messages to families in theUnited States and vice versa.''</TEXT></DOC>
