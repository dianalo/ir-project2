<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-78-0347 </DOCNO><TEXT>Low pressure sprayed MCrAlY overlay coatings are currently being usedon advanced single crystal superalloy blades for gas turbine engines.Many studies were made on the influence of coatings on the mechanicalproperties of superalloys in oxidizing or hot-corroding environments,but very few on the properties of the bulk coating alloy itself. Thecreep behavior of a typical NiCoCrAlY alloyd (PWA 276) was studied inair and vacuum. The as-received low pressure plasma sprayed NiCoCrAlYplates were heat treated for 4 h at 1080 C followed by 32 h at 870 C,the heat treatment applied to coated superalloy parts. Standard creepspecimens 12.7 mm long and 3.2 mm in diameter were then machined. Constantload creep-rupture tests were performed in air and vacuum at 650, 850,and 1050 C and various initial stresses. In addition, some specimenswere preoxidized at 1050 C for 100 h prior to testing. Results are brieflydiscussed.</TEXT></DOC>
