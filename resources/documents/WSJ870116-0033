The company also dropped its previous assertion that the problems were caused by driver error. &quot;It's unfortunate that the problem was presented that way,&quot; said John B. Damoose, the Volkswagen AG of West Germany vice president who is in charge of Audi.    Mr. Damoose added that the acceleration problems have had &quot;a detrimental effect on our image and sales.&quot; He said sales at Audi, a Volkswagen unit, were down 20% last year from 1985, and in recent months &quot;have been down even more.&quot;    Audi said it will recall all the 1978 through 1986 Audi 5000 series models with automatic transmissions that the company has sold in the U.S. The recall, as requested by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, covers 250,000 cars. Last July, the company had agreed to recall only 132,000 cars built from 1984 through 1986 to install a device that it said would prevent such mishaps. These problems so far have caused hundreds of accidents and injuries and some deaths, according to the agency.    Separately, Audi said it would also comply with the agency's request to replace defective idle-stabilization valves in some 1985 and 1986 models. This recall affects 60,000 cars.    The recalls follow an evaluation last December by the agency, which is an arm of the Transportation Department, that &quot;a safety related defect may exist&quot; in those cars. The agency cited that it had received 700 complaints, and reports of 513 accidents, 271 injuries and five deaths resulting from the cars allegedly accelerating without warning. The incidents happened after the drivers shifted gears from park to drive or reverse, according to the agency.    Audi previously had blamed the sudden accelerations on seat adjustment, foot position and driving habits. Last May, it announced that it would recall 132,000 1984-86 models to relocate the accelerator and brake pedals, stating that drivers then would be less likely to depress the accelerator rather than the brake. Mr. Damoose said yesterday that Audi never followed through on that recall because the company came up with a &quot;better way' to tackle the problem.    The solution the company opted for was the installation of an &quot;automatic shift lock&quot; -- a device that prevents the shifting from park to reverse or drive unless the car's brake pedal is depressed. In late July, Audi said it was recalling those 132,000 cars to equip them with automatic shift locks. Audi said the device has already been installed in 70,000 cars.    Yesterday Audi announced a stepped-up campaign to get Audi owners to bring their cars back to their dealers promptly for the installation of the device. The company said it would attempt to reach all owners by mail or by phone, and would monitor the use and effectiveness of the device, which is standard equipment on 1987 models.    Audi also will replace the idle-stabilization valve and inspect the idle-stabilization systems in some 1985 and 1986 models. The safety administration has said it doesn't think that the valves, which control engine speed, are causing the sudden-acceleration accidents, but that they might be contributing to the problem. Audi said it already has replaced the valve in 36,000 cars under a service program. Mr. Damoose said that installing the shift locks and the valves will cost Audi $25 million.    The Center for Auto Safety said the recalls fall short of solving the problems. Dan Howell, an official at the Washington-based consumer group, said the sudden accelerations have occurred in 1986-model 5000 cars equipped with the shift-lock devices, and in some cars with new, idle-stabilization valves. He said what's needed is for Audi to repurchase the cars, or at least to make a major redesign of electronic engine-idle components.    Mr. Damoose said he was aware of 11 cases of sudden acceleration in cars equipped with the shift-lock devices. He said that while three cases haven't been investigated, in two cases the device was installed improperly. In the six remaining cases, he said, the accelerations occurred because the drivers shifted from neutral to park or reverse. The device works only when the shift is made from the park position, he said.    ---   Also contributing to this article was Albert R. Karr. </TEXT></DOC>
