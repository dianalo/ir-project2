Angolan authorities said several civilians were killed.   More than a dozen Mirage and Impala aircraft attacked threebases of the South-West African Peoples Organization in southernAngola, the Defense Force chief, Gen. Jannie Geldenhuys, said in astatement.   He said the attacks avenged the bombing Friday of the FirstNational Bank in Oshakati, South-West Africa, where 18 people werekilled and 31 injured. Most of the dead were black governmentemployees cashing their weekly paychecks.   Geldenhuys accused SWAPO of the bank bombing. The guerrillagroup has been fighting for 22 years against South Africa'soccupation of South-West Africa, also known as Namibia.   On Friday, SWAPO denied involvement in the bank blast, thedeadliest in Namibia in two decades. It has claimed responsibilityfor other bombings in Namibia.   SWAPO officials in London declined to comment on Saturday's raid.   Later Saturday, Angola's defense ministry said the air assaulton Lubango and Onjiva left several civilians dead.   A statement reported by the official Angolan news agency ANGOPsaid the exact number of victims had not yet been determined,according to a report monitored in Lisbon.   The ANGOP report made no mention of SWAPO or Geldenhuys'announcement.   On Friday, South African Defense Minister Magnus Malan andForeign Minister Roelof ``Pik'' Botha warned neighboring statesthat South African troops would undertake unannounced ``hotpursuit'' raids across borders to fight guerrilla groups.   ``We have repeatedly invited them (neighboring states) to talkwith us to sort our problems in peace. Now they have demonstratedthey are not interested,'' Botha said, reacting to news of theNamibian bombing. ``As far as I'm concerned there is no more talkof a regional conference _ not from our side. We're no longerinterested in the neighboring states.''   Geldenhuys said eight Mirage fighters took part in the attack ontwo targets near Lubango, about 190 miles north of theNamibian-Angolan border; and five Impala aircraft attacked targetsat Ongiva, about 25 miles north of the border.   Geldenhuys said all the South African aircraft returned safely,but gave no estimate of casualties inflicted.   He said the Lubango targets were ``SWAPO's most importanttraining center in Angola, the Tobias Hainyeko Training Center, anda terrorist holding area about 10 kms (6.2 miles) west of there.''   An Air Force source told The Associated Press that the jets thatattacked Lubango were probably Mirage F1-As, a French-designedfighter-bomber capable of carrying about 14,000 pounds of bombs.   The Impalas are a South African version of an Italian Aermacchilight attack craft. They can carry Sidewinder air-to-air missilesand are able to carry about 4,000 pounds of missiles or bombs.   The general said SWAPO had launched a number of attacks fromOngiva on civilians in South-West Africa.   In 1971, the United Nations ruled that South Africa's occupationof Namibia was illegal. But South Africa has defied the court andcontinued its occupation.   Only about 70,000 of Namibia's 1.3 million people are white, andthe South African government has installed a multiracialtransitional administration to run the territory's affairs.   SWAPO has refused to negotiate with the transitional government,citing the U.N. resolution demanding free elections.   South African and South-West African troops have been fightingfor about five months in Angola on behalf of the UNITA rebelmovement, which is battling the Marxist government in Luanda. SouthAfrican officials say they will not grant independence to Namibiauntil the 40,000 Cuban troops supporting Angola's Marxistgovernment leave Africa.   All of South Africa's black-ruled neighbors _ Swaziland,Lesotho, Mozambique, Botswana and Angola _ have accused SouthAfrica of staging unannounced cross-border raids during the past 10years, killing dozens of civilians as well as alleged guerrillas.   South African officials have denied, refused to comment on, orridiculed most of the claims, although they did announce a raidlast year on Livingstone, Zambia.   But military officials have acknowledged previous ``hotpursuit'' operations against SWAPO in southern Angola.   Botha and Malan presented their statement Friday as a newget-tough policy against neighboring governments which, they say,allow the anti-apartheid African National Congress, SWAPO and otherguerrilla organizations to stage attacks on South Africa from theirterritories.   By law and custom in South Africa, apartheid establishes aracially segregated society in which the 26 million blacks have novote in national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economyand maintain separate districts, schools and health services.</TEXT></DOC>
