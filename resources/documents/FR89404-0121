Background </ITAG>Section 201(b)(3) of the Asbestos Hazard Emergency Response Act (AHERA)required EPA to conduct a study to determine ``the extent of danger tohuman health posed by asbestos in public and commercial buildings and themeans to respond to any such danger.'' In February 1988, EPA respondedto that statutory mandate by publishing its study findings in a Reportto Congress. EPA's Report to Congress examined a variety of asbestos control optionswhich go beyond present Agency actions. However, the EPA Administrator,in a letter transmitting the Report, concluded that greater Federal regulationof asbestos in public and commercial buildings was not the most responsibleapproach for EPA to take at this time. The Administrator reached that decisionfor three reasons. First, the current infrastructure of accredited personneland enforcement staff is inadequate to handle the inspection and abatementactions that could be stimulated by a new regulatory inspection or abatementprogram for public and commercial buildings. Second, the nation's primaryfocus needs to remain on schools, because children, who are the primaryoccupants of school buildings, may be particularly vulnerable to asbestosexposure and because any significant additional demand on the nationalinfrastructure imposed by new and immediate regulation could underminethe successful completion of the school asbestos program. Finally, thereis inadequate information about asbestos exposure and its control in publicand commercial buildings to determine the appropriate scope and scale ofa new regulatory program on asbestos. Although the Administrator concluded, for the reasons stated above, thatit would be unwise and inappropriate to initiate rulemaking at this time,the Administrator recommended four steps be taken for assessing and improvingthe quality of asbestos-related actions currently taking place in publicand commercial buildings. These steps, to be carried out over a 3-yearperiod, were to enhance the nation's technical capability, focus attentionon thermal system insulation asbestos, improve enforcement activities directedat prevention of imminent hazards, and objectively assess the effectivenessof the AHERA Schools Rule and obtain additional information essential tofuture decisionmaking.EPA believes that meeting with all groups which have an interest in theissue of asbestos in public and commercial buildings is important for theAgency to carry out successfully the steps recommended in the Report toCongress. EPA believes these groups can help prepare the Agency for anyappropriate future programmatic and regulatory decisions on asbestos bysharing their views and insights on the current status of the nation'stechnical capability, the significance of new exposure and efficacy information,the applicability of the AHERA schools process for non-school buildings,and the merits of various regulatory strategies. For these reasons, EPAhas scheduled the public meeting identified in this notice, and is preparedto schedule additional meetings if they are necessary to ensure that allkey issues are discussed thoroughly and that all affected groups have anopportunity to convey their opinions.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Key Issues for Discussion</ITAG>EPA anticipates that the following will be among the key issues for discussionat the public meeting:1. What is the nature and scope of exposure to asbestos in public and commercialbuildings, given the current regulations in place and the effectivenessof their enforcement?2. Is the infrastructure of accredited personnel and enforcement staffdeveloping adequately to handle a major, new program of asbestos controlfor public and commercial buildings? If not, under what circumstances andwhen could we expect this infrastructure to be in place?3. How can EPA best fill some of the significant gaps in its informationbase on asbestos exposure in public and commercial buildings?4. What further Federal actions are appropriate either now or in the future?What are the societal burdens associated with such actions and what benefitsto society could be anticipated?<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Participants</ITAG>All interested individuals and groups are invited to attend and to participatein the public meeting. EPA has identified certain groups whose interestsshould be represented. These groups include building owners and managers,service workers, real estate interests, mortgage bankers, asbestos managementand control professionals, and former and present manufacturers of asbestos-containingmaterials.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Additional Meetings</ITAG>Additional meetings may be necessary to ensure that all key issues arediscussed thoroughly and that all affected parties have an opportunityto convey their concerns. Such meetings will be open to the public. Personswishing to be given notice by mail of future meetings may contact the TSCAAssistance Office at the address and telephone number given above under<T2> ``FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT.''</T2><ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: March 29, 1989. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Charles L.
