(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Jim Bakker, head bowed and bound hand andfoot, was led into federal prison to begin a 45-year sentence fordefrauding thousands of followers of his television ministry.   ``My reports are he's going through the process very normally,''Warden Don Southerland said after Bakker arrived at the TalladegaFederal Correctional Institution late Tuesday.   After surrendering his valuables, showering, leaving hisfingerprints and donning prison garb, Bakker entered the cell hewill share with ``another lightweight security inmate,''Southerland said.   After his arrival, the founder of PTL kept his eyes on theground as six guards hustled him from a brown sedan to the entranceof the rural, medium-security prison in east Alabama.   Officials said he would stay here for about two weeks beforetransfer to another prison.   ``Obviously, he is not a normal inmate, but he is beingprocessed as a normal inmate,'' Southerland said.   Two former Bakker aides sentenced a month ago to more than 17years each after being convicted of income tax evasion reported toan Alabama prison today. David Taggert and his brother, James,arrived at the minimum-security prison at Maxwell Air Force Base inMontgomery.   Bakker had no comment for the dozens of reporters gathered atthe red-brick prison surrounded by two 15-foot fences topped withrazor wire.   U.S. District Judge Robert Potter of Charlotte, N.C., whosentenced Bakker on Tuesday, also fined him $500,000. Saying thatBakker was unrepentant and still trying to milk supporters formoney, he ordered him to begin serving the long sentenceimmediately.   Bakker would have to serve at least 10 years in prison beforeachieving parole unless a planned appeal is successful.   Southerland said Bakker was allowed to contact his family beforebeing placed in his two-man cell for the night.   The warden said he had no details on what calls Bakker made.Baksides had an agreement notto reveal the nature of the sanctions. ``I could only confirm whatthe Turkish spokesman said today,'' the U.S. official told theAssociated Press.   The Senate committee approved the measure despite a full-scalelobbying campaign by the Turkish government against it.   The government has taken the sanctions to put pressure on theU.S. administration to make efforts to block the adoption of theresolution by the full Senate, said a government official speakingon condition of anonymity.   He said the defense cooperation pact between Turkey and theUnited States could be jeopardized when it comes up for renewalnext year if the Senate approves the measure.   The United States maintains its military installations in Turkeyunder this defense pact.   No date has been set for full consideration by the Senate.</TEXT></DOC>
