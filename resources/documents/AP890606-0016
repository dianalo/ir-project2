Now, hisexperience in China is a guiding influence in setting U.S. policytoward the troubled giant.   In his announcement Monday of a cutoff in U.S. arms sales toprotest the bloody suppression of China's pro-democracy movement,the government's No. 1 China hand said he took the action becausehe understands China ``reasonably well.''   For that reason, Bush said the events of the past few days couldonly leave him with ``a saddened heart.''   ``I am trying to take steps that will encourage a peacefulchange, and yet recognize the fact that China does have a greatpride in its own history. And my recommendations are based on myknowledge of Chinese history,'' Bush said.   That doesn't mean he understands what has happened, said Bush,who less than four months ago shook hands with bicyclists inBeijing's Tiananmen Square, presented Texas cowboy boots to PrimeMinister Li Peng and bantered about exercise regimens with seniorleader Deng Xiaoping.   Of the military assault that left hundreds dead and thousandswounded, Bush said: ``I condemn it; I don't try to explain it.''   Asked for his best assessment of the political situation inChina, Bush also demurred. ``It's too obscure,'' he said at a newsconference Monday.   But China expertise has always been a major element of thewell-laden foreign-policy resume that Bush brought to the OvalOffice.   For Bush, who headed the U.S. liaison office in Beijing for 16months in 1974-75 and since then has visited the nation five times,this expertise is also the source of extreme caution _ a cautionthat previously provoked criticism.   In his 1987 pre-election autobiography, ``Looking Forward,''Bush wrote that during his tour of duty in China he often had the``feeling the more you learn about the Chinese, the less you reallyunderstand them.''   ``I have a special affection for the Chinese people. I've keptup my knowledge of China and my relationship with various leadersthere,'' he told a business audience Monday night.   Although House and Senate leaders of both parties were nearunanimous in their praise for Bush's stern but careful actionsMonday, his reticence in speaking out for human rights when hevisited Beijing in late February prompted criticism.   The criticism intensified when a dissident he invited to afarewell banquet, astrophysicist Fang Lizhi, was barred by Chinesepolice from attending the ceremony.   Still, Bush defended this caution anew on Monday while issuinghis strongest criticism thus far of the Chinese government. ``Thisis not a time for anything other than a prudent, reasonedresponse,'' he said.   Bush said his actions Monday will deny the Chinese more than$600 million worth of U.S. government military equipment sales andan estimated $85 million or so annually in private arms sales.   He also banned visits by Chinese military officials, offeredhumanitarian and medical assistance to those wounded in the assaultand suggested that the United States would extend the visas ofChinese students here afraid to return to their homeland.   Bush, however, said he was not ready to do ``something moreflamboyant,'' such as recommend trade sanctions or recall the U.S.ambassador, ``because I happen to believe that this relationship isvital to the United States.''   Bush suggested, as he has in the past, that he's sensitive toChina's own sensitivity to outside criticism.   ``China historically has been less than totally interested inwhat other countries think of their performance,'' Bush said.Still, he expressed hope that ``the depth of the feeling towardsdemocracy is so great that you can't put the genie back in thebottle and return to total repression.''   Bush's actions won support from many on Capitol Hill.   ``This is a time to allow the president to lead on that kind ofissue, especially when you have a president with this level ofpersonal expertise in Chinese affairs,'' said Sen. David Boren,D-Okla., chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee.</TEXT><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE><TEXT>   Tom Raum covers the White House for TheAssociated Press.</TEXT></DOC>
