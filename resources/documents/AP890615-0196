He said Canada also is supporting efforts to ban commercialtrading in African elephant ivory under the Convention onInternational Trade in Endangered Species.   ``We are delighted that they have acted,'' said Ron Orenstein, aspokesman for the African Elephant Emergency Network.   The Canadian group, whose sponsors include the World WildlifeFund and Toronto Zoo, has been lobbying for bans to choke the ivorymarket.   Orenstein said poachers have killed more than 1.25 millionAfrican elephants in the past decade, reducing the continent'selephant population to 750,000.   ``About 80 percent of the elephant ivory imported to the Westcomes from poachers,'' he said. ``At this rate the elephants will beextinct in 10 to 12 years.''   Poaching has increased, he said, because prices for ivory havegone up from $2.70 a pound in the 1960s to $136 a pound.   He said the United States, France, West Germany, Britain andother countries already have taken similar action.   Officials could not immediately estimate the value of ivory salesin Canada.</TEXT></DOC>
