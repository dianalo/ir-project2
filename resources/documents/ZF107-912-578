(PC Magazine's short format reviews)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Losee, Stephanie K.andM;</AUTHOR><DESCRIPT/><TEXT>Inside PC Magazine is used to doing things in a big way.andP;  From single-topicissues with 100 or more products to features tables the size of handballcourts, there's very little we do on a small scale.andM;But not every vital product category in the computer industry demands a50,000-word story.andP;  There are myriad nonmainstream business applications thatare essential to the daily lives of our readers, as well as upgrades ofimportant products--both of which are often better suited to a shorter formatthan a multi-product roundup.andP;  Thus the &quot;short feature&quot; was born.andM;It's often the case that the smaller a project, the greater the preparationnecessary.andP;  Our short features will boast the extensive testing you're usedto seeing on these pages, but presented in a concise fashion.andP;  We'll getright to the meat of the story, giving you the information you need to makean intelligent buying decision.andP;  Typically, the short feature will run 4 to 5pages.andM;First up are paint programs, examined by contributing editor Luisa Simone.andP;  Afive-year veteran of PC Magazine, Simone has held several positions fromassistant managing editor to executive editor.andP;  Last year Simone was amongthe editors who formulated the short-feature concept, making her an obviouschoice as the reviewer for our first attempt in the short format.andM;&quot;What these stories attempt to do is get down to the nitty-gritty productinformation that you get from your better-informed friends over the phone,&quot;Simone explains.andP;  &quot;Because of their condensed nature, the reviews get to theheart of the matter much more quickly.andP;  We'll tell you why you would want touse these products, and whether they do what they should.&quot;andM;The four paint packages each cost under $100 and support the full VGA paletteof 262,000 hardware colors.andP;  Simone found out that price and value don'tnecessarily correlate.andP;  &quot;There are some amazing low-cost programs out there.andO;None of them is perfect, but they do provide a lot of the functionality ofexpensive programs.andP;  Besides that, they're fun.&quot;andM;Budget plays a part in another of this issue's feature stories: low-endintegrated software.andP;  The seven packages go for less than $200 each andinclude word processing, database, and spreadsheet modules with a commoninterface.andM;After failing to live up to inflated expectations years ago, thesealmost-all-you'll-ever-need products are making a comeback.andP;  With extras suchas graphics, communications, and desktop utilities, they've come to representa remarkable value.andP;  The laptop-toting executive may find that one integratedsoftware package on a 720K 3.5-inch disk can make life on the road just alittle less bumpy.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
