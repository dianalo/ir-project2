BP Chairman Peter Walters said he was confident that the stake is a long-term investment and that the London-based investment arm of the Kuwaiti government doesn't intend to interfere with BP's management. But Mr. Walters said he wouldn't like the stake to exceed 20%. BP apparently hasn't received assurances from the investment office that it will halt its share purchases at 20%.    CIE. DU MIDI said it filed for regulatory approval to take full control of seven of its main units through share swaps that would boost its capital by an unspecified amount. The French insurance and financial-services group said the plan is part of efforts to restructure its holdings. But analysts speculated that Midi is seeking to fend off any hostile interests that might have been responsible for a recent flurry of interest in its stock.    GEBRUDER SULZER AG, the big Swiss machinery company, said it reached the beginnings of a possible agreement with a dissident shareholder, Tito Tettamanti. It didn't elaborate. Mr. Tettamanti leads a group of investors controlling about 35% of Sulzer's registered shares. Sulzer asserts that the group wants to take over the company, while Mr. Tettamanti maintains that he only wants Sulzer to adopt a strategy more oriented toward high-technology and growth sectors. </TEXT></DOC>
