But a more interestingquestion is whether doctors should prescribe drug A instead of drug B forfuture patients.andP;  Such an question would require an inferential analysis.andO;The thrust would be to generalize the findings of this study to all heartattack patients in, say, the U.S.andM;Most statistical techniques can be used for both description and inference.andO;However, we often think of basic, summary statistics such as the mean andstandard deviation as descriptive and statistical tests such as thechi-square test and the F-Test as inferential methods.andM;Univariate vs.andP;  Multivariate: There are two types of inferential methods:univariate and multivariate.andP;  A univariate procedure is used to investigatethe effect of one independent (or predictor) variable on another dependent(or outcome) variable e.g., the effect of age on death rates for a givendisease.andM;On the other hand, multivariate procedures are used to look at the effect oftwo or more independent variables on an outcome-e.g., the effect of age, sex,and smoking on death rates.andP;  Certain statistical tests such as the t-test andthe chi-square test are inherently univariate, while others such as linearregression and analysis of variance can be used as both univariate andmultivariate procedure.andM;Categorical, Ordinal, and Continuous Variables: In order to select anappropriate statistical technique, it's useful to determine the scale of agiven variable (in stat programs a variable is the equivalent of a databasefield).andP;  The term scale refers to the range of values that a variable cantake (for the sake of this discussion, I'm referring to numeric variablesonly).andM;Categorical (also known as discrete or nominal) variables have no underlyingorder or significance to their values.andP;  For example, for the categoricalvariable sex, we might assign a 1 for males and a 2 for females.andP;  Thisdoesn't mean that females are twice as large as males, or that men have halfthe sex of women (although some may debate this point).andP;  In other words,there's no significance to the values assigned to categorical variables.andO;Other examples of categorical variables are marital status and race.andP;  Animportant subclass of categorical variables are those taking only two values,called dichotomous.andP;  Sex (male/female) and mortality (alive/dead) are twoexamples of dichotomous variables.andM;Like categorical variables, ordinal variables are made up of a finite numberof categories, but unlike categorical variables, the order of categories isimportant.andP;  Examples of ordinal variables are opinions  excellent, good,fair, poor) and developmental stage (infant, toddler, child, pre-teen, teen,adult).andP;  A continuous variable has values that are ordered; but unlikeordinal variables, the range of values is infinite (or close to it) and isdrawn from a continuum.andP;  Continuous variables can be measured with realnumbers, but, to keep it simple, are often reported as integers.andP;  Forexample, age, although usually stated as an integer (e.g., 23 years old) canbe measured much more precisely (23.356 years old).andP;  Other examples ofcontinuous variables include blood pressure, time, and annual income.andM;Hypothesis testing: Most inferential procedures report their results in termsof 'statistical significance' or  pvalues.' These terms are related to a veryimportant part of statistical inference called hypothesis testing.andO;Hypothesis testing involves the specification and testing of a specifichypothesis at a given &quot;alpha-level.&quot;andM;In order to specify a hypothesis, we must first identify a dependent variable(or outcome variable).andP;  If the dataset was collected as part of an experimentor study, then the dependent variable will likely have been predefined whenthe study was designed.andP;  If the data was collected to predict someoccurrence, then this variable is the dependent variable.andP;  Variables notconsidered to be dependent, are termed independent variables (also known aspredictor variables or covariates).andM;For example, let's say we're investigating a new manufacturing process forwidgets.andP;  We're primarily concerned with the quality of the widgets,therefore the variable QUALITY, is the dependent variable.andP;  This variable isa categorical variable taking on two values  1=acceptable or 2=defective).andO;The primary independent variable is the manufacturing process, PROCESS.andP;  Thisvariable is also of categorical scale, with values  1=old process or 2=newprocess).andP;  Our hypothesis might be that the new manufacturing process(PROCESS=2) produces a smaller proportion of defects than the oldmanufacturing process  PROCESS=1).andP;  But before we can proceed, we must firstrestate our hypothesis in terms of the null hypothesis.' The null hypothesisdescribes the situation when the actual hypothesis isn't true-when it isnull.andP;  Thus, the null hypothesis might be that process 2 produces the sameproportion of defects as process 1.andM;Statistical significance: Without getting too heavy into statistical theory,an alpha-level is a probability cut point at which you're willing to believewith reasonable certainty that the null hypothesis is refuted.andP;  For moststatistical significance tests, it is customary to set the alpha-level at0.05.andP;  Then, if the observed significance level (or p-value) of the test is0.05 or less, the null hypothesis is rejected-a statistically significantresult was observed.andP;  If, on the other hand, the p-value is greater than0.05, we would fail to reject the null hypothesis, and we would conclude thatit is unclear if the observed outcome is due to a true effect, or due merelyto a chance sampling variation.andM;In the widget example, we would conclude that the new process wassignificantly better than the old if the p-value was less than or equal to0.05.andP;  Otherwise, we would conclude that an observed reduction in defectsmight be due to chance.andP;  (Even if the p-value was 0.05, the observedreduction might still be due to chance, but such a situation is unlikely andshould occur only in 1 out of 20 samples (1/20 = .05)).andM;-Paul Litwin</TEXT></DOC>
