The United States on Thursday named Japan, Brazil and India asunfair traders that must negotiate to remove barriers within 18months or face possible sanctions, including tariffs of up to 100percent on selected goods.   India joined Japan in criticizing the U.S. action. CommerceMinister Dinesh Singh said it was ``totally unjustified, irrationaland unfair.''   The Japanese Foreign Ministry summoned U.S. Ambassador MichaelArmacost today to explain the government's position, said ministryspokesman Taizo Watanabe.   ``The government of Japan has no intention of entering intonegotiations with the United States under the conditions imposedunder Super 301,'' Hiroshi Mitsuzuka, minister of internationaltrade and industry, said in a statement.   ``Super 301'' refers to the provision of the 1988 U.S. OmnibusTrade Act allowing the United States to target countries andpractices that block American exports.   The European Community and Japan and other countries have saidthe unilateral nature of the U.S. law may violate the provisions ofthe international General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, or GATT.   If sanctions are imposed under Super 301, Japan may bring acomplaint before GATT, which is supposed to help resolve tradedisputes, Watanabe said.   Watanabe was not as confrontational as Mitsuzuka, however.Although Japan will not negotiate under terms of the U.S. law, itmay propose ``quiet talks and joint cooperation'' that may``coincide with'' the negotiations Washington demands, Watanabesaid.   Foreign Minister Sousuke Uno called the U.S. action ``extremelyregrettable,'' and said it was designed to draw attention away froma large source of the trade imbalance, the U.S. budget deficit.   ``As a result of many market-opening measures that have beentaken to date, the Japanese market has now become a widely openmarket,'' Uno told reporters.   ``The U.S. itself maintains import restrictive measures andpractices to a considerable degree,'' he said.   Japan was targeted for unfair trade practices in supercomputers,satellites and lumber.   But officials cited increases in Japanese purchases of U.S.goods and expressed anger at U.S. charges of unfairness.   Japan is launching five U.S. communications and broadcastingsatellites this year, ``which proves our satellite market is opento foreign companies,'' said Posts and Telecommunications MinisterSeiichi Kataoka.   The United States charges that Japan's policy of encouraging adomestic space industry prohibits the purchase of foreignsatellites if they interfere with ``indigenous developmentobjectives,'' effectively limiting U.S. access to the market.   Japan will buy eight U.S. supercomputers within three years, thegovernment announced earlier this month.   The United States says that through a variety of exclusionarypractices, Japan has ``thwarted the open procurement process'' ofsupercomputers.   The U.S. statement also said Brazil's import licensing system``inhibits market access and creates uncertainty for U.S.exporters.'' It criticized India for requiring government approvalof all new or expanded foreign investment.   Dinesh, India's commerce ministerm said Washington had no rightto blame his country for blocking U.S. imports when the UnitedStates does the same thing with Indian imports.   ``The United States' action is particularly surprising becausethe U.S. itself has built and retained a variety of barriersagainst access to its markets. It is hardly in a position to askothers to lift barriers without doing so itself,'' Dinesh said in astatement.   The United States has a trade deficit of about $700 million withIndia and a $52 billion deficit with Japan.   Last year, India exported $3.2 billion in goods to the UnitedStates and U.S. exports to Indian was about $2.5 billion.</TEXT></DOC>
