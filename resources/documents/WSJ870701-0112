White House aides said no final decision was made yesterday. But they said the president would like to nominate Judge Bork, a respected, strong conservative who sits on the federal appeals court for the District of Columbia, if he can win Senate approval. A final decision and public announcement may be made today, aides said.    To assess how controversial the choice of Judge Bork would be and to weigh other names, White House Chief of Staff Howard Baker and Attorney General Edwin Meese spent much of the afternoon at the Senate, meeting separately with Republican and Democratic leaders.    Aides to Kansas Sen. Robert Dole, the Senate Minority Leader, and South Carolina Sen. Strom Thurmond, the senior Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee, who both met with Messrs. Meese and Baker, said the administration officials discussed a list of 10 to 12 names and didn't indicate a front-runner. Judge Bork was on the list, they said.    A moderate Republican senator who wasn't in on the meetings with Messrs. Baker and Meese said any nominee will be &quot;highly, highly controversial&quot; because the Supreme Court's conservative-liberal balance of voting may be altered. Of Judge Bork, the senator said, &quot;He's got an outstanding reputation, but the scrutiny will be very tough.&quot;    Sen. Patrick Leahy (D., Vt.), a member of the Judiciary Committee, which will consider the nomination, said that because President Reagan has more than a year left in his term, &quot;unless they get someone who just screams for rejection, this year the administration can twist enough arms to get the nominee through.&quot;    Even before the announcement of the nomination, civil rights groups have advised Senate aides that they would fight Judge Bork. &quot;If the name is Bork, the groups will go to the wall on it,&quot; said Nancy Brof of the Alliance for Justice, a liberal organization.    Senate aides began scrutinizing Judge Bork's lengthy record of more than a decade as a Yale Law School professor, five years on the appeals court and almost four years as solicitor general in the Justice Department. Among some Democratic aides, there was cause for concern at first glance.    In 1963, then-Prof. Bork wrote an article in the New Republic magazine opposing part of legislation that later became the 1964 Civil Rights Act. He argued against the section barring discrimination in private facilities that serve the public, such as hotels and restaurants, calling it &quot;legislation by which the morals of the majority are self-righteously imposed upon a minority.&quot;    Even a hint of opposition to civil rights legislation is enough to create a maelstrom among liberal and moderate Democrats and moderate Republicans in the Senate. However, at his confirmation hearing for the solicitor general post in 1973, he said, &quot;I no longer agree with that article. . . . It seems to me the statute has worked very well and I do not see any problem with the statute.&quot;    But Senate aides also raised concern about articles and court decisions he has written on various other topics. These range from a series of lectures in 1971 suggesting that the First Amendment's free speech guarantee is intended to protect only political discussion and debate, to an appeals court ruling in 1984 that the right to privacy that the Supreme Court has found implied in the Constitution doesn't apply to homosexual conduct.    Another source of controversy is Judge Bork's role as solicitor general in firing Watergate special prosecutor Archibald Cox in 1973 after then-Attorney General Elliot Richardson and Deputy Attorney General William Ruckelshaus resigned rather than carry out President Nixon's order.    Judge Bork has been criticized for this role in the &quot;Saturday Night Massacre&quot; from time to time and has replied that a president has a right under the Constitution to have his lawful orders carried out. In an interview, Mr. Richardson said he had urged the then-solicitor general in 1973 to remain in the Justice Department and to carry out the president's order. He said Judge Bork considered resigning, as well, in 1973, but that he urged him to stay on for the stability of the department.    &quot;There was no good reason for him to resign, and some good reason for him not to,&quot; said Mr. Richardson.    ---   Andy Pasztor contributed to this article. </TEXT></DOC>
