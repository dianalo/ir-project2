Background </ITAG>OSHA's methods of compliance policy, first adopted by OSHA from nationalconsensus standards in 1971, and subsequently included in OSHA substancespecific health standards, requires that employers rely primarily on feasibleengineering controls to prevent employee exposures from exceeding permissiblelevels. This requirement, in particular, is stated in the OSHA RespiratoryProtection Standard, 29 CFR 1910.134(a)(1), which applies to all exposuresto airborne toxic substances, and in the Air Contaminant Standard, 29 CFRandSection; 1910.l000(e), which applies to exposures to 600 substances listedin Tables Z-l, Z-2, and Z-3. Thus, 29 CFR 1910.1000(e) requires employersto first implement engineering and administrative controls to comply withthe permissible exposure limits for substances listed in the above Tables.Similar language appears in OSHA's generic respirator standard which setforth the conditions of respirator use required to protect the health ofemployees. (29 CFR 1910.134(a)(1)). These standards were adopted withoutfull rulemaking proceedings to allow OSHA to quickly put into place a bodyof workab1e regulations, pursuant to section 6(a) of the Occupational Safetyand Health Act of 1970 (29 U.S.C. 655 <T3>et seq</T3>). This methods of compliance policy has also been incorporated in every healthstandard adopted pursuant to section 6(b) of the Act after OSHA's evaluationof the related rulemaking records. All substance specific health standards(except for the 13 carcinogen standards, 29 CFR 1910.1003-1016. which mandatespecific engineering controls) and the carcinogen policy (29 CFR Part 1990)recite a generalized preference for engineering and work practice controls.However, in each such standard OSHA has identified circumstances or operationswhere the record shows the infeasibility or impracticality of installingengineering controls and has allowed reliance on respiratory protectionas well. However, the generic standards, 29 CFR 1910.1000(e) and 134(a)(1),do not set out most of these modifying circumstances in their regulatorytexts. In certain recognized situations and conditions under OSHA's substancespecific standards, engineering controls are not required and respiratoruse is permitted. For example, the following standards permit the use ofrespiratory protective devices during installation of feasible engineeringcontrols, where engineering controls are not feasible. and where it isnecessary to supplement engineering controls in order to achieve full compliance:asbestos, arsenic, lead, coke ovens, cotton dust, DBCP, acrylonitrile,and ethylene oxide. Other specific allowances for respirator use can befound in standards for arsenic (maintenance and repair), lead (for employeesexposed less than 30 days per year), coke ovens (maintenance and repair),acrylonitrile (maintenance, repair, and vessel cleaning), and ethyleneoxide (collection of quality assurance samples, removal of biological indicators,loading and unloading of tank cars, changing ethylene oxide tanks, vesselcleaning, and maintenance and repair activities). These examples providea clear indication of the Agency's realistic expectations with respectto the implementation of engineering controls and of the flexibility impliedwith respect to the meaning of ``feasible engineering controls.'' In addition,in an enforcement context, it may be demonstrated that for specified operationsengineering controls are infeasible. OSHA seeks comment on whether thesespecific types of allowances should be explicitly built into the generalmethods-of-compliance provisions. OSHA's policy has been criticized by some as too inflexible, not cost-effective,often unnecessary for health protection and outdated based on the argumentthat sufficient progress has been made in respirator technology and applicationto permit their use on a wider scale. In order to address these criticisms OSHA published an ANPR on February22, 1983, to solicit public comment on issues such as preference for engineeringcontrols, comparative protectiveness of respirators and engineering controls,total costs of respirators and engineering controls, and the use of engineeringcontrols even if such controls fail to reduce levels to below the PEL.OSHA was also seeking information that would help the Agency to focus onthree primary policy considerations: The first consideration was health protection. It had been postulated thatthere may be many instances where respirators would provide protectionto employees equivalent to engineering controls, and that their routineuse should be permitted. The second consideration was that respirator technology and use practiceshave progressed significantly since initial adoption of OSHA's compliancerequirements in 1971. As a result of many of these advances, the consensusamong many occupational health professionals concerning what constitutesa reasonable effective respirator program has changed. This point is demonstratedby the issuance of the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) Z-88.2-1980standard, entitled ``Practices for Respiratory Protection,'' a revisionof the 1969 ANSI standard. In addition, improved respiratory protectionprograms are currently being addressed in a proposed revision of OSHA'srespiratory protection standard (29 CFR 1910.134). It was suggested, therefore,that, in the presence of such programs, respirators would be capable oftaking a more significant role in air contaminant protection than theyhave had before. The third consideration was cost-effectiveness. There may be instanceswhere the costs of engineering controls would exceed the expected costsof respiratory protection, and where the routine use of respirators mayprovide adequate employee protection. Should such instances exist, reasonableallowances for the use of respiratory protection should be made. For the foregoing reasons, it was felt to be timely and appropriate toreexamine OSHA's policy on methods of compliance. Over 135 ANPR comments were received, with a wide range of responses fromindustry, labor, health organizations, and others. In addition, rulemakingrecords from other standards which OSHA has promulgated have been re-examinedand relevant exhibits have been placed in this record. Labor unions opposedany change in the role of respirators in current programs. In addition,NIOSH, and Los Alamos and Lawerence Livermore research laboratories, highlyrespected for their expertise and experience in exposure control technology,also opposed changing the existing policy. The preponderance of data in this and other rulemaking records (ethyleneoxide, cotton dust, DBCP, acrylonitrile, arsenic, lead, asbestos, cancerpolicy) support the industrial hygiene principle that engineering controls,where feasible, are more effective in controlling exposure than other means.Commenters representing unions, (2-53, 2-102, 2-122, 2-98), universities(2 120), research organizations (2-128, 2-138, 2-131, 2-81), and healthassociations (2-89), contended that the requirement to implement feasibleengineering controls should be maintained. Industry representatives thatacknowledged the superiority of feasible engineering controls include ATandamp;T(2-59), DOW (2-71), Monsanto (2-88), and ALCOA (2-103).These commenters agreed that engineering controls provide reliable andconsistent levels of protection to a large number of workers and are notdependent on individual human performance. Data submitted to the recordsupport this assertion. Performance of engineering controls can be monitoredcontinually, inexpensively, and can be predicted at the design stage. Asstated by DOW, ``The primacy of engineering controls for controlling exposureis an accepted principle of occupational health'' (2-71). ATandamp;T commentedthat ``Engineering controls should always be given primary consideration''(2-59). Los Alamos' Industrial Hygiene Group has stated.<ITAG tagnum="21">That * * * there are no analytical results to indicate that respiratorsoffer equal or better protection than engineering controls and with veryfew exceptions * * * respirators simply cannot offer the same degree andreliability of protection to employees, as properly designed and operatedengineering controls (2-13l).</ITAG>The University of North Carolina commented that:<ITAG tagnum="21">All industrial hygiene practice indicates feasible engineering controlsshould take precedence * * * (Ex. 2-120).</ITAG>ALCOA, addressing the reliability of engineering controls and respirators,provided the following:<ITAG tagnum="21">Engineering controls generally provide better and more reliable methodsof protecting employee health * * * Improperly wearing respirators canbe a continual problem. While we believe this occurs less than 5% of thetime in many of our plants, we expect it occurs more frequently in someplants_possibly in the order of 30% or more of the time. (Ex. 2-103).</ITAG>Many industry commenters, however, called for increased flexibility inOSHA's compliance policy; still others for abandonment of the preferencefor engineering controls. For example, the Chemical Manufacturers Associationstated [Ex. 2-72], in response to the question of whether OSHA should requirethe use of feasible engineering controls ``in preference'' to the use ofrespirators, as follows:<ITAG tagnum="21">As long as the employer meets a permissible exposure limit (PEL),controls the skin contact, or meets the appropriate biological levels thatare consistent with employee health and safety, OSHA should not requireany specific control strategy [sic]. Means for achieving such standardswill often involve engineering controls and the use of respirators as wellas administrative and work practice controls. Methods of reducing exposureto the desired level will be different in each workplace and the combinationof engineering, administrative, and work practice controls and use of respiratorsshould be left to the employer.</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Representing a broad cross section of industry, the National Associationof Manufacturers [Ex. 2-91] similarly stated, arguing that OSHA's currentmethods policy was actually counterproductive to worker safety and health,as follows:<ITAG tagnum="21">The threshold question is whether current OSHA standards requiringemployers to implement feasible engineering controls to maintain air contaminantsin the workplace to within prescribed permissible exposure limits and permittingengineering controls are not feasible, not yet installed, or are inadequateis conducive to the ``most effective'' protection of workplace health.It is the NAM's belief that almost exclusive reliance on engineering controlswhile not accounting for situational variations is neither the most effectiveapproach nor in the best interest of overall worker protection. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Few professionals in industry would argue that engineering controlsare not the ``ideal'' means for the elimination or mitigation of workplacehazards. However, ideal solutions rarely work as well as expected in practiceand practical concerns must also be considered. These practical concernsinclude all hazards rather than a single hazard and must be viewed in relationto and interacting with a total workplace safety and health program. Underthis total program, the ideal solution for the control of one hazard maylikely limit an employer's ability to address the remaining segments ofthe program. Thus, preference for one form of control over another, unmindfulof the variables involved, we believe, is counterproductive to the effectivenessof a balanced and truly effective overall safety and health program. Forthis reason, the feasibility of an engineering control should not be thesole determinant of its use and OSHA policy should not reflect this short-sightedgoal.</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Specific companies reflected similar concerns. Thus, the DOW ChemicalCompany [Ex. 2-71] noted:<ITAG tagnum="21">The prime concern in any reconsideration of the methods-of-complianceprovisions must be maintenance of safety and health protection for employeesto prevent work-related injuries, illness and death. Such protection cannotbe achieved by mandating a hierarchy of control techniques. Dow recommendsthat OSHA delete or modify any mandatory preference to allow employersgreater flexibility to use their professional judgment to determine thebalance of engineering controls, work practices, operator training <T3>and </T3>personal protective equipment that is most effective for themin achieving the appropriate level of protection.</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Another major chemical company, Du Pont, emphasized the effectivenessof respirators together with the need for greater flexibility:<ITAG tagnum="21">Much has changed since the current methods of compliance policy wasadopted. Data obtained from research on the performance of respiratorsin the workplace, much of it performed by DuPont, lend strong support tothe conclusion that respirators provide reliable employee protection whenused in a good respirator program. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Recent research on workplace protection factors demonstrates thatrespirators provide effective control for exposure to airborne chemicalswhen they are used correctly in a good respirator program. In many casesthey provide the most cost effective means of control. Accordingly, DuPontbelieves that respirators, like engineering and administrative controls,have a proper role to play in the protection of employee's. Therefore,DuPont recommends that each employees personal work environment be maintainedat a safe exposure level through implementation of cost-effective engineeringcontrols augmented as necessary by personal protective equipment and/orwork practice controls. The choice of methods should depend on the factorsin each specific situation. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="37">* * * * * </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The choice of the proper method(s) of compliance involves, therefore,far more than the simple dichotomy of engineering controls versus respirators.For this reason, the question ``Which are better, engineering controlsor respirators?'' cannot be satisfactorily answered in the abstract. Asthe information and comments offered by Du Pont in the enclosure will indicate,the choice of the proper method(s) of compliance is best made on an individualizedbasis by industrial hygiene professionals. So long as the two criteriaidentified above have been met, an employer should not be needlessly contrainedfrom choosing the control strategy that makes sense for his particularoperation.</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Atlantic Richfield Company [Ex. 2-80], in endorsing comments submittedby the American Petroluem Institute [Ex. 2-73], noted: <ITAG tagnum="21">Employers should have the option to select a protective control strategyrather than being mandated to adhere to the current rigid hierarchy ofexposure controls. The ultimate goal of any control strategy must be theadequate protection of workers exposed to contaminants. Varying controlstrategies will achieve that goal at least equally well, and often morecost-effectively, as the fixed controls provided by current policy. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In support of this recommendation we want to emphasize that the statutorylanguage of the OSH Act does not mandate the primacy of engineering controls.Support for this conclusion is fully developed in API's comments. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">OSHA should recognize the significant advances in both technologyand applicability of respirators in the last decade. New methods and proceduresfor fit-testing and respirator fit reliability have been developed.</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Other commenters expressed similar concerns. (See Cast Metals Federation[Ex. 2-49], Horston Lighting andamp; Power [Ex. 2-21], the American Gas Association[Ex. 2-77], SCM Corporation [Ex. 2-21], and National Agricultural ChemicalsAssociation [Ex. 2-77]. National Paint and Coatings Association, Inc. [Ex.2-78]. Motor Vehicles Manufacturers Association [Ex. 2-95], and The HealthIndustries Manufacturers Association [Ex. 2-110]. This rulemaking does not address the assessment and reduction of any absoluteexisting risks but rather addresses the possible change in risk abatementassociated with the use of respirators instead of engineering controls.The nature of the risks involved concerns differences in degree of protectionbetween respirators and engineering controls as applied in various typesof work situations involving different air contaminants. The Proposal OSHA proposes to modify its existing requirements in 29 CFR 1910.1000(e)and 134(a)(1) that specify primary reliance on feasible engineering andwork practice controls, by further clarifying the circumstances, basedon experience with OSHA's 6(b) standards and data and information submittedfor the record, under which more extensive use of respirators may be appropriate.The record does identify specific situations where engineering controlsgenerally may not be feasible, and where respirators may have to be used(Exs. 2-51, 2-72, 2-131). OSHA, therefore, is proposing to specify fivesets of circumstances where there will be no need for employers to showthat engineering and work practice controls are not feasible before anemployer can rely on respirators to reduce employee exposure to requiredlevels. In large part, these circumstances reflect the current application of thetwo standards involved and circumstances recognized in substance-specificstandards. By setting out explicit situations OSHA hopes to make futureapplication of the methods of compliance policy more uniform and understandable.It is noted that provisions adopted under this standard will not changethe compliance provisions found in OSHA's existing substance specific standardswith the possible exceptions of the STEL provisions in the ethylene oxide(29 CFR 1910.1047), benzene (29 CFR 1910.1028) and formaldehyde (29 CFR1910.1048) standards. The preamble to those standards indicated that ifevidence were to be submitted during this rulemaking, appropriate to ethyleneoxide, benzene or formaldehyde on the STEL compliance issue OSHA wouldconsider making appropriate changes to each rule. If information developedin the course of this rulemaking demonstrates that changes should be madein any of the existing substance specific standards, OSHA will amend thesestandards to permit employers to elect to use either respirators or engineeringcontrols to achieve compliance with those existing short term limits. The circumstances listed define concrete situations where OSHA has or wouldhave treated the primary reliance on engineering controls as infeasiblein most cases. Within these circumstances employers will be able use anycombination of engineering or work practice controls and respiratory protectionto effectively reduce employee exposures to required levels. OSHA also notes that as under the current standards, OSHA's enforcementof the hierarchy of controls provision is on a case by-case basis. Othersituations where engineering controls may be infeasible can be more easilyidentified because of the explicit examples provided in the proposed provisions.OSHA has recognized other circumstances where respirators are essentialto guarantee employee health in some substance-specific standards. Thus,OSHA has provided that in work operations such shutdown and repair activitiesrespirators may be used as a primary control strategy. (See 29 CFR 1910.1048(a)(1)(ii),Formaldehyde; 1910.1047(g)(1)(ii), Ethylene oxide (EtO); 1910.1043(f)(1)(ii),Cotton dust; 1910.1029(g)(1)(b), Coke Oven emissions; 1910.1018(h)(1)(ii),Inorganic arsenic; 1910.1001(g)(ii), Asbestos, tremolite, anthophyllite,and actinolite). OSHA has not proposed an explicit exclusion for maintenance activitiesfor the generic standards. As OSHA observed in the preamble to the carcinogenpolicy, based on its review of that voluminous record, although these activitiesare ``intermittent, often unpredictable and often undertaken when engineeringcontrols break down * * * some maintenance activities are feasibly controlledby engineering and work practice controls'' 45 FR 5226. Moreover, the Agencybelieves that routine activities that are performed on a repeated or scheduledbasis can be controlled through implementation of feasible engineeringand work practice controls. Compliance plans can be developed and engineeringcontrols implemented for predictable activities, including routine maintenance.However, OSHA raises for comment the question of whether it is necessaryto require that all feasible engineering controls such as ventilation systemsbe installed solely for maintenance activities. Specifically, OSHA wouldlike to receive examples of instances which would demonstrate that an engineeringcontrol requirement exclusively for maintenance exposures would or wouldnot be appropriate. (For activities such as shutdown and repair, whichare necessary due to unexpected or unpredicted occurrences, respiratorswould be permitted as they would be the only available source of protectionagainst exposure.) The Agency does agree, however, that there may be some activities thatare considered to be maintenance that may have to be performed with respiratorsdue to the absence of other controls. Nevertheless, as discussed above,the Agency believes many maintenance activities lend themselves to controlby engineering means. OSHA does not have sufficient information to listspecific maintenance jobs commonly performed in general industry that mayrequire widespread use of respirators. Therefore, the Agency is interestedin receiving comment on the practicality of listing specific maintenancejobs for which engineering controls are generally infeasible or maintenanceactivities where respirator use is otherwise appropriate based on considerationof duration, frequency and whether routine or not. Thus, data are solicited regarding circumstances, conditions, frequency,and duration of the types of industry-wide maintenance activities thattypically require the use of respirators due to the general infeasibilityof engineering control implementation or for which respirators would, inany case, provide sufficient protection. The five sets of circumstances that have been identified by OSHA from datain the record where engineering controls may generally be infeasible include:1. During the time necessary to install feasible engineering controls;2. Where feasible engineering controls result in only a negligible reductionin exposure; 3. During emergencies, life saving, recovery operations, repair, shutdowns,and field situations where there is a lack of utilities for implementingengineering controls; 4. Operations requiring added protection where there is a failure of normalcontrols; and 5. Entries into unknown atmospheres. A provision-by-provision discussion of the proposed revisions follows:1. OSHA is proposing to allow primary reliance on respiratory protectionduring the time necessary to install or implement feasible engineeringcontrols. This circumstance was specifically identified in submissionsto the ANPR (Exs. 2-91, 2-50), and in all substance specific standards(see e.g. 29 CFR 1910.104(g)(1)(i), EtO; 1910.1045(h)(1)(i), cotton dust).2. OSHA is proposing to allow primary reliance on respiratory protectionwhere engineering control implentation would result in only a negligiblereduction in exposures. OSHA requests comment on whether setting forththis additional explicit regulatory language is necessary in light of existingprovisions requiring that only feasible engineering means be implementedto reduce exposures. Current OSHA enforcement policy and practice recognizethat the degree of expected exposure reduction is part of the determinationof feasibility. Therefore, OSHA feels that it may be unnecessary to supplementthe current compliance requirements with specific language as suggestedabove. Further, to define in regulatory terms on a broad basis what a ``negligible''reduction in exposure level is in general industry as a result of engineeringcontrol implementation, as opposed to defining it on a case-by-case enforcementbasis, may prove to be confusing to employers and impractical to OSHA.Nevertheless, since the potential success of exposure reduction is consideredin determining feasibility, proposing specific language to that effectwould not change current OSHA policy and therefore, may be appropriatefor clarification purposes. Comment is requested on this issue. OSHA points out that this exception does not cover the required supplementaluse of respirators when feasible engineering controls do not ``achievefull compliance'' pursuant to 29 CFR 1910.1000(e). Rather, it refers tosituations where engineering controls would achieve exposure reductionsonly to a negligible degree. Comments in response to the ANPR identified some operations which may becovered by this proposed provision. However, further case-by-case analysisstill will be required (Exs. 2-131, 2-118, 2-132). Thus, for example, theAmerican Foundrymen's Society (AFS) asserts that ``technical limitationsprevent the control of dust exposures to within permissible exposure limitsby engineering means at most chipping and grinding operations.'' (Ex. 2-44).Spray painting booths were also cited as virtually impossible to engineerto achieve substantial exposure reduction (Ex. 2-36). OSHA notes however,that engineering controls may be feasible to implement, and the issue maybe the degree to which they are effective. The proposed provision wouldallow reliance on respirators when feasible engineering controls only achievenegligible exposure reduction. If in the case of foundries, the installationof local exhaust hoods and increased housekeeping make little differencein the employee's exposure because of unalterable difficulties in hoodplacement, then the provision may apply. If however, engineering controlscan reduce exposures, although not down to the PEL's, the unrevised supplementalrespirator use provision of andSection; 1910.1000(e) would, as now, comeinto play and require a combined control strategy, and not total relianceon respirator protection.OSHA also notes that confining discussion about the effectiveness of feasibleengineering controls to ``conventional'' controls may dictate unwarrantedconclusion of infeasibility, loss of productivity or ineffectiveness. NIOSHhas pointed out that, for example, in the plastics and resins industry,implementing controls for cotton dust, and in silica flour milling, engineeringcontrol modifications and innovation increased production and control effectivenessover ``conventional'' technology. (Ex. 2-81). Innovative controls whichare available will have to be assessed before this exception may be reliedon. 3. The third provision proposed by OSHA to permit reliance on respiratoryequipment encompasses several circumstances where total reliance on engineeringcontrols would be ineffective or inappropriate. These are emergencies,recovery operations, unscheduled repairs shutdown, and in field situationswhere there is a lack of utilities for implementing engineering controls.OSHA believes that in these circumstances, respiratory protection has provenitself generally as the most and often the only practical means to minimizeemployee exposure. Respirators may be the only means of protection in situationswhere engineering controls cannot be implemented due to the remotenessof the locale, other configuration of the site, or the characteristic ofthe work operation. Further, some of the defects of respirators, i.e.,lack of employee acceptance and degradation of fit over time are greatlyreduced by the short time they may be worn during emergencies, recoveryoperations, unscheduled repairs and shutdown. Most submissions supportedrespirator use in circumstances similar to exception three. For example,Monsanto noted that during emergencies (liquid spills, fire fighting, etc.)respirators are used in operations where routine protection is achievedby engineering controls (Ex. 2-88). API noted that respirators are theonly means to provide emergency protection in the event of an equipmentfailure (Ex. 2-93). Most substance specific standards permit primary respirator use in thesesituations (See e.g. andSection;andSection; 1910.1018(h)(1)(ii), arsenic; andSection;1910.1029(g)(1)(d), coke oven emissions); and andSection; 1910.1044(h)(1)(iv),DBCP). 4. OSHA is also proposing to allow reliance on the use of respirators inoperations involving materials which are primarily controlled by engineeringdevices to protect employees in the case of control breakdown. 0SHA's intentis to allow respiratory protection to be used as a redundant control systemwhere redundancy is considered necessary either because of the toxicityof the substance or the possibility of engineering breakdown. For example,Conoco, Inc. stated that ``standby or back-up respiratory protection isnormally maintained in all locations where hydrogen sulfide (H<T2>2</T2>S) gas is produced in case of accidents'' (Ex. 2-60). 5. The fifth circumstance proposed to allow reliance on respiratory protectionis for entries into unknown atmospheres. Preliminarily, OSHA intends tocover confined spaces or vessel entry and tank cleaning and vessel cleaning.Most commenters who addressed this issue agreed that respiratory protectionwas essential for these activities, and that engineering controls were,in the main, infeasible (Ex. 2-112). OSHA believes that employees will be effectively protected in the situationsevisioned in provisions 4 and 5, by the proper selection and use of respiratoryprotection. The Agency requests comments on all aspects of these proposed provisions.In particular, the clarity of the ``exception provisions'' is of concernto the Agency, because one reason for these provisions is to provide certaintyand uniformity of application to employers and OSHA enforcement personnel.In addition to requesting comment on the appropriateness of allowing theuse of respirators during the activities discussed above, OSHA requestsdata, views, and comment on other situations, as discussed below, whereit may be acceptable to use respirators in lieu of engineering controls,and which should be allowed for, as part of this rulemaking, in a finalmethods of compliance rule. Specifically, comment is sought on the appropriateness of permitting theuse of respirators for work situations in which the hazardous exposureis of very brief duration. OSHA permits the use of respirators in specificactivities in a number of its existing section 6(b) standards based, inpart, on the short duration of the activity. For example, respirator useis permitted under the ethylene oxide standard (29 CFR 1910.1047) duringthe collection of quality assurance samples, removal of biological indicators,and changing of ethylene oxide tanks or cylinders. These activities aretypically brief in nature. The concept of according acceptability of respiratorsfor intermittent use is also found in the benzene (52 FR 34460) and lead(29 CFR 1910.1025) standards which, in general, permit their use wherethe regulated substance is used in the workplace less than a total of 30days per year. These exceptions to implementation of engineering controlswere adopted in each specific standard based on data that demonstratedthe acceptability of the use of respirators for those particular circumstancesin those particular substance using industries. Thus, it is not presentlyclear to OSHA whether such exclusions can be appropriately applied generally.Another regulatory agency, the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA),is also exploring the issue of ways to permit more flexibility in requiredexposure control methods for unusual situations. For example, MSHA is consideringpermitting the use of respirators in ``tasks such as maintenance or investigativeactivities [which] require occasional entry into hazardous atmospheres.''Comments submitted to the Methods of Compliance record also argued forincorporation of flexibility in respirator use under certain conditions.One commentor stated that respirator use should be permitted in lieu offeasible engineering controls for a certain percentage of time per individual,per work station (Ex. 2-43). This suggests, perhaps, that employers shouldbe allowed to establish a ``respirator budget'' to allocate a certain numberof days per year or hours per day for employees to wear respirators inlieu of feasible engineering controls. Comment and data is sought thatdemonstrate that ``budgeted'' respirator use will result in reliable andpredictable control equivalent to that afforded by engineering controls.Others supported allowing employers to rely on respirators to control exposuresfor short term tasks (Ex. 2-61), and for high exposure variability, infrequentand small exposed population job tasks (Exs. 2-88, 2-93). None of thesecomments, however, provided substantial data to the record demonstratingthat employee protection would not be compromised by permitting the useof respirators in these instances in lieu of feasible engineering controls.Receipt of such data is requested by OSHA. As indicated above, however, OSHA is not convinced based on available datathat it is appropriate for the Agency to adopt broadly applicable genericexposure control provisions incorporating intermittency or short durationof operation as a basis for permitting the use of respirators in lieu ofengineering controls, as found in the specific standards discussed above.Therefore, comment and data are solicited that demonstrare or refute theappropriateness of adopting this approach into a final rule on OSHA's methodsof compliance requirements, based on the frequency and duration of theactivity, that could be applied to general industry. Comment is also specificallyrequested on whether actual final regulatory language which would reflectthis approach should incorporate specific time limitations as to the durationand frequency of use per work shift and what these specific time limitationsshould be, or should, rather, such language be phrased in general, flexibleterms such as ``brief duration,'' ``short duration,'' or ``brief intermittentuse'' without specific time limitations. If a time limitation is suggested,the Agency requests data and information as to the appropriate time periodand why adequate protection would be provided by respirators during thatperiod.Related to the issue of the appropriateness of permitting short durationuse of respirators, as discussed above, is the issue of specifically permittingrespirators to be used to achieve compliance with short-term exposure limits(STELs). The preambles to the recently promulgated benzene (52 FR 34460)and formaldehyde (52 FR 46168) standards, for which STELs were adopted,and the preamble to the ethylene oxide standard (53 FR 11414), for whichan excursion limit was adopted, indicated that OSHA would consider in itsMethods of Compliance rulemaking whether different principles should applyas to means of compliance for the STEL or excursion limit, such as usingrespirators to meet the short-term limit, but not the TWA. Neither theethylene oxide, benzene nor the formaldehyde standard adopted a provisionallowing respirators to be used to achieve compliance with the short-termlimit in lieu of feasible engineering controls because data in their specificrespective records did not justify such an allowance. It is noted in eachstandard's preamble that if evidence is submitted in the Methods of Compliancerulemaking, appropriate to ethylene oxide, benzene or formaldehyde on theshort-term limit compliance issue OSHA will consider making appropriatechanges to each rule. OSHA therefore requests, additional data beyond thosereceived during the specific 6(b) rulemakings, addressing the questionof whether the compliance requirements in these standards should be modifiedwith respect to control of short-term exposures. Data and views are solicitedon circumstances under which it would or would not be appropriate to permitemployers to elect to use either engineering controls or respirators asthe primary means of limiting exposure to within the benzene STEL, theformaldehyde STEL, or the ethylene oxide excursion limit. Based on information received during this rulemaking, that is pertinentto these substances with respect to compliance requirements for controlof short-term exposures, OSHA will either amend these standards to permitemployers broader discretionary use of respirators regarding STEL compliancein this rulemaking, or will reaffirm the conclusions reached during theprevious rulemakings for each of the three substances. OSHA presently does not have sufficient data to justify proposing to includeregulatory language allowing STEL compliance for all substances to be achievedsolely through the use of respirators. Since OSHA has received no documentationthat convinces the Agency that respirators can be used as a consistentlyeffective means of routinely meeting STEL's on a widespread basis, theAgency is raising this issue for comment. The Agency is raising this issue for comment in conformance with statementsto that effect in the ethylene oxide, benzene and formaldehyde standards.OSHA therefore requests substantive technical data concerning conditionsand situations under which respirators can be employed successfully inlieu of other controls to achieve STEL or excursion limit compliance, andconcerning how and why the use of respirators for protection against short-termexposures can be differentiated from protection against TWA exposures withrespect to effectiveness. Comment on another area where broader use of respirators may be acceptableis also being requested by OSHA. As discussed earlier, the question ariseswhether there are circumstances in the workplace where the protection affordedby respirators would be equal to the protection provided through implementationof engineering controls. In particular, the question arises whether thereare circumstances where the costs of the respirator program would be lessthan those of engineering controls and yet equal protection would be affordedby either. Are there circumstances in which cost effectiveness factorsare a legitimate consideration in determining the acceptability of oneexposure control method over another. Also, what workplace factors wouldhave to be considered to evaluate the effectiveness of a control methodbefore costs could be taken into account? A number of factors that maybe appropriate to consider in determining whether engineering controlsor respirators will provide adequate protection in a particular situationwere raised for comment in the ANPR. OSHA seeks further comment on howfactors such as described below should be taken into account by OSHA orthe employer in determining the acceptability of using either engineeringcontrols or respirators. Workplace factors which may affect the performanceand degree of protection provided by exposure control means may include:number of exposed employees and number of employees with respirator fittingproblems; severity of acute and chronic health effects; length and frequencyof exposure; ability to measure and ensure the adequacy of exposure control;work rate; temperature and humidity of the workplace: ability to assessthe probability of protection failure; detectability of control failurebefore harm; and the extent to which employees may be expected to wearrespirators for any required period. Comment received on these factorsas set forth in the ANPR revealed that an important role is played by eachin determining the suitability of compliance methodology. Engineering controlswere suggested as being particularly preferred where health effects aremore severe, where there are more lengthy and frequent periods of exposure;where respirator failure warning properties do not exist; where the workrate exertion level is greater, where significant respirator fit problemsexist, and where extreme temperature and humidity conditions exist. OSHAagain raises for comment the question as to how or if these workplace factorsshould be viewed in deciding whether engineering controls or respiratorsare most appropriate and, further, how these factors could be reflectedin a final rule to define those circumstances where respirator use wouldprovide appropriate protection and would, thus, be permitted under therule. How would it be determined that employees would be provided withthe desired degree of protection? It is noted here that OSHA is in theprocess of revising its standard on respiratory protection (29 CFR 1910.134)and that consideration should be given as to whether an increased degreeof protection may result where respirators are used in comformance withthe new respirator program provisions. It is not clear to OSHA at this time, however, how it can be determinedthat respirator use is equally protective as engineering controls, costsnotwithstanding. Nevertheless, OSHA seeks comment that would show the appropriatenessof allowing cost effectiveness to be incorporated as a control method selectionfactor. In the preceeding discussion, OSHA has maintained its support for a continuanceof its existing compliance method hierarchy, but has also suggested that,under certain specific sets of circumstances, it may be appropriate toallow respirator use in lieu of feasible engineering controls, thus providingflexibility in determining the appropriate method of compliance. For example,OSHA seeks comment on a requirement to permit respirator use in lieu offeasible engineering controls in certain instances where the employer hassubmitted a comprehensive written respirator compliance program to theAgency. This compliance plan would be subject to OSHA approval and wouldbe required to demonstrate to the Agency that the use of respirators underthe circumstances described would provide protection to the employee equivalentto that afforded if feasible engineering controls were implemented. OSHAbelieves, however, that this flexibility may not be appropriate where thesubstance involved is a carcinogen, has no identified dose-response threshold,continues to pose a significant risk at the PEL, has no respirator breakthroughwarning properties, or if there are no means of determining the specificin-use effectiveness of the respirator. On the other hand, if the effectivenessof respirators can be monitored readily in some manner, such as by biologicalmonitoring, it may be appropriate to permit their limited use. The Agencysolicits comment on the issue of OSHA approved respirator use. Views aresought on criteria which should be considered and met for respirator complianceprogram approval and on circumstances, as suggested above, under whichrespirator use should not be permitted in lieu of feasible engineeringcontrols.An alternative which would provide even more flexibility with regard torespirator use is to allow employers under any circumstances to complywith exposure limits by any method the employer deems advisable. Some commentershave suggested that establishment and enforcement of a good respiratorprogram will result in effective exposure control where respirators areused in place of engineering controls, and that employers should be allowedto implement such respirator programs under the standard in circumstancesdeemed appropriate by the employer (Exs. 2-61, 2-88, 2-93, 2-94, 2-109).For example, the Ethyl Corporations states that ``The government shouldnot regulate the need for engineering controls but should regulate theuse of personal protective equipment, requiring the employer to show thatprotection is being provided'' (Ex. 2-109). The American Petroleum Instituteasserts that ``The burden should rest on the employer to demonstrate thatits employees are protected by whatever [control] strategy is chosen''(Ex. 2-93). Finally, 3M states that ``A well written performance standardshould satisfy the requirement that OSHA ensure that exposures are withinpermissible exposure limits while allowing the employer to be concernedwith the `how' of meeting a specific standard'' (Ex. 2-88). OSHA is notconvinced that, as suggested by these commentors,  implementation of evena strong respirator programs will result in equivalency of protection affordedby respirators as compared to engineering controls. The inherent limitationsof respirators preclude their providing equivalent protection to engineeringcontrols for use as the primary means of exposure control in most all circumstanceswhere implementation of engineering controls are feasible. A control methodwhich limits contaminant entrance into the workplace (e.g. engineeringcontrols) has been clearly shown to be a more effective application ofindustrial hygiene principles than one that does not. Nevertheless, OSHAseeks comment on whether continuance of the control hierarchy is stillnecessary in any form, and whether adoption of a purely performance orientedcompliance provision into a final methods of compliance rule is a viableoption. Comments in support of discontinuance of the control hierarchyshould describe the specific circumstances under which such a change wouldbe appropriate and how it would result in continued equivalent employeeprotection. Data and information are also sought that can demonstrate thatadoption of a performance oriented compliance requirement will maintainthe protection afforded employees under current methods of compliance provisions.If the employer is permitted to choose any mix of control methods to achievecompliance, should choice of the method be at the discretion of the employeror should the method chosen be required to be approved by a professionalin the field of safety and health or other technicially qualified person?Commenters supporting continuance of OSHA's current policy should providepertinent data that demonstrate the necessity of maintaining primary relianceon feasible engineering and work practice means of exposure control. Based on the preceeding discussion, OSHA proposes to add a new paragraph1910.1000(f) that explicitly sets forth circumstances in the workplacewhere employers may choose to use respirators in lieu of engineering meansas a permissible method of controlling employee exposures to toxic substanceslisted in the Z-tables of section 1910.1000. OSHA also proposes to modifysection 1910.134(a)(1) by incorporating a statement of reference that indicatesthat respirators may be used in lieu of control in the circumstances listedunder proposed paragraph 1910.1000(f). Regulatory Impact OSHA has not performed a preliminary Regulatory Impact Analysis, RegulatoryFlexibility Analysis, or paperwork clearance package for this action sinceadoption of the proposed requirements would add no new regulatory burdenson employers with respect to either costs or information collection. <ITAG tagnum="84">II.
