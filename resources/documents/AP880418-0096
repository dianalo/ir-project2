RUBIN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Supreme Court today agreed to decidewhether states may bar political party leaders from endorsingprimary election candidates and whether states may regulatepolitical party structure.   The justices said they will consider reinstating parts of aCalifornia law overturned as infringements on citizens' rights toexpress themselves and associate with whom they please.   The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last October threw out keyportions of the California election law.   That decision marked the second time in less than two years thatthe appeals court said the state had interfered unconstitutionallywith political parties. The Supreme Court last year ordered theappeals court to reconsider its initial ruling in light of a 1986Supreme Court decision on political parties.   The justices had ruled in 1986 in a case from Connecticut thatstates with open primaries may not bar independent voters fromcasting ballots to determine party nominees.   The 9th Circuit court said the 1986 ruling supported itsdecision to strike down portions of the California law.   ``Prohibiting the governing body of a political party fromsupporting some candidates and opposing others (in primaryelections) patently infringes both the right of the party toexpress itself freely and the right of party members to anunrestricted flow of political information,'' the appeals courtsaid.   ``California's ban on pre-primary endorsements is a form ofpaternalism that is inconsistent with the First Amendment,'' itsaid.   The appeals court also struck down rules that dictated themake-up of state party central committtees and set terms of officefor party chairmen.   State officials said the ban on primary endorsements wasdesigned to prevent factionalism within parties and to preventvoters from being unduly influenced by party leaders.   California revamped its elections laws around the turn of thecentury to break the grip on political parties by wealthy specialinterests, particularly the Southern Pacific Railroad Co.   But the 9th Circuit court said such rules as prohibiting partyleaders from endorsing candidates in primaries now have the effectof undermining the parties' main goals.   ``The state has effectively drained party central committees ofpolitical power,'' the appeals court said.   The state law was challenged by county Democratic and Republicanleaders and by state leaders of the Libertarian Party.   The case is March Fong Eu vs. San Francisco County DemocraticCentral Committee, 87-1269.</TEXT></DOC>
