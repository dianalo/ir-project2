<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-67-0983 </DOCNO><TEXT>One-dimensional particle simulations have been carried out to study thelow frequency broadband electrostatic noise that propagates almost perpendicularlyfrom the magnetic field line when a nonrelativistic electron beam isinjected into space from a spacecraft. For T{sub e} = T{sub i} the electrostaticion cyclotron waves appear as well as the waves near the lower hybridfrequency. When the magnetic field is reduced so that {Omega}{sub e}andless;andless; {omega}{sub pe} in a non-isothermal plasma, T{sub e} andgt; T{sub i}, obliqueion acoustic instabilities appear to propagate almost perpendicular tothe magnetic field. In addition, a very low frequency mode at {omega}andless;andless; {Omega}{sub i} is found to be generated by the electrons flowing intothe conductor. Both the ion injected beam electrons as well as the ambientelectrons flowing into the spacecraft are responsible for generatingthose instabilities, which accelerate ions perpendicular to the magneticfield. 11 refs., 9 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
