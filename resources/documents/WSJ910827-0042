The projects, which the company called small-scale, willnonetheless test the gear's ability to ease maintenanceproblems such as weather damage and squirrels chewing onphone lines and improve phone circuit rearrangement.</LP><TEXT>   But Michael Bloom, director of customer premises,broadband applications, for the Pacific Telesis Groupsubsidiary, said testing has already shown that the fiberequipment provides superior phone communications. The newlines will replace copper wires to the curbs outside 394residences in La Crescenta, Calif. Another project involving295 homes in Hawthorne, Calif., will begin by fall 1992.   The installations are being done because &quot;we envision thatthe cost of fiber technology will soon become less expensivethan copper,&quot; said Chuck Johnston, Pacific Bell vicepresident and general manager, Los Angeles.   &quot;This is not the first use of fiber, but it's the firsttime a phone company has taken out old equipment and put infiber,&quot; said John N. Kessler, president of Kessler MarketingIntelligence, a Newport, R.I., market research firm. &quot;Thissignals that fiber is being used for actual deployment.&quot; Hesaid there are now 6,000 U.S. homes involved in fiber-opticfield trials, a number that &quot;will grow tenfold&quot; by the end of1992.   Several phone companies are testing service to homes andbusinesses using fiber-optic lines, including GTE Corp. andBellSouth Corp. While these tests have focused on thetransmission of information and even television signals,Pacific Bell is running ordinary voice phone service.   Analysts say the use of fiber is bound to change theeconomics of phone service. Fiber-optic lines can carry farmore voice and data traffic than copper wire, and could thusboost operating profits.   But customers for the first time may have to power theirown phone service. That's because phones using the new glasswires may not be electrically powered by the phone company asare phones that work off today's copper network.   Pacific Bell said it will run fiber from its centralswitching office to &quot;optical-electrical converters&quot; placedalong streets or on telephone poles -- &quot;fiber to the curb,&quot;in phone industry parlance. These converters, which servefour to eight homes, change the electrical signals from aphone into light pulses and vice versa, completing theconnection. Copper cable connects the converters to the homeor business, and electrical power will be supplied separatelythrough a network power outlet.</TEXT></DOC>
