The rise in gold led other precious metals higher in heavy trading.    Traders said buying was triggered when Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker told the Senate Banking Committee that Brazil had fallen back into &quot;a grave economic crisis&quot; after a couple of years of substantial progress. Confidence in Brazil, Mr. Volcker said, &quot;has been lost to a considerable extent.&quot;    The Volcker comments followed reports Wednesday that Brazil was considering imposing controls on its foreign-exchange operations that would delay some interest payments on its $108 billion foreign debt.    Many traders fear that Brazil's difficulties could cause banking problems that would &quot;throw the financial markets into a tizzy,&quot; said Steven Pepper, senior vice president and gold trader for Republic National Bank of New York. Investors typically hold gold as a hedge against financial crises, and the news led many gold traders to buy back contracts that had been sold earlier.    On the Commodity Exchange, gold futures for February delivery rose $7.50 an ounce to $400.20. The more active April contract gained $7.40 to $402.70. Estimated volume was a heavy 50,000 contracts, or five million ounces.    Silver prices on the Comex also rose, with the March contract gaining 6.5 cents to $5.475 an ounce. On the New York Mercantile Exchange, platinum for April delivery advanced $11.70 an ounce to $514.50.    The rise in metals prices was partly in response to a drop in the value of the dollar. The dollar ended up relatively little changed against other major currencies, but it was well below its intra-day highs reached early in the session, traders said.    Chart-guided technical buying also helped metals, analysts and brokers said. Recent losses in gold &quot;had been overdone,&quot; one trader in New York said, and &quot;we were due for a technical bounce.&quot;    Several analysts said the introduction of tough South Africa sanctions bills in Congress gave late support to prices, especially for platinum. Sen. Alan Cranston and Rep. Ronald Dellums, both California Democrats, introduced bills to require divestment of U.S. financial interests in South Africa and a U.S. trade embargo to protest that nation's apartheid policy.    South Africa is a major metals producer. Analysts said they doubt it would respond with any supply disruptions even if the proposed sanctions are enacted.    Despite the day's gains, bullion demand remains soft, according to Robert Mizrahi, chief gold trader at Mocatta Metals Inc., New York. And some analysts, saying the reaction to the Brazilian news probably will diminish, expect profit-taking to develop.    In other futures markets yesterday:    GRAINS AND SOYBEANS: Wheat futures rallied amid rumors that the U.S. will again offer to subsidize Soviet purchases of U.S. grain. However, Melvin Sims, who administers the so-called export enhancement program for the Agriculture Department, said of the reports, &quot;It's news to me.&quot; The Soviets didn't accept a similar U.S. offer last fall. Corn and soybean futures rallied amid heavy buying by grain merchants and processors. Slack farmer selling of both crops also buoyed prices.    FOREIGN CURRENCIES: Many futures prices closed slightly higher. Richard Kapsch, head of foreign currency futures trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange for E.F. Hutton andamp; Co., said the market will &quot;probably be choppy again&quot; today as traders try to gauge the intentions of the Group of Five finance ministers, who plan a weekend meeting in Paris. Many foreign-currency traders said they doubt that the meeting will result in substantive steps to support the dollar. Fed Chairman Volcker told the Senate Banking Committee yesterday that the West German mark and the Japanese yen could rise further against the dollar if those countries fail to stimulate their economies.    SUGAR: Futures prices closed higher, with the March contract up 0.24 cent at 7.43 cents a pound. Analysts cited a pause in the recent heavy liquidations of the maturing March contract and reports that China had bought 60,000 metric tons of refined sugar. One analyst said several other nations are in the market for purchases totaling more than 100,000 tons. Open interest for March fell to 24,867 contracts at Wednesday's close, still a sizable amount for this time of the month, analysts said. The March contract won't be traded after next Friday.    COTTON: Futures prices fell for the fourth consecutive day on selling prompted by what one analyst called a &quot;temporary and seasonal&quot; halt in buying in the cash market. Prices declined as much as 1.98 cents a pound, with the July contract touching its daily limit of a two-cent decline before recovering slightly. The selling depressed prices below 53.70 cents a pound in the March contract and 53.30 cents for May. Those levels, reached Jan. 29, had withstood two previous price declines and were regarded as key support levels, analysts said. The March contract finished at 52.65 cents a pound, down 1.72 cents, and the May contract at 52.15 cents a pound, down 1.65 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
