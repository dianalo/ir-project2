This paper discusses multiprocessingarchitectures and describes the developing technology directed towardadvanced multiprocessor machines that is supported by the Defense AdvancedResearch Projects Agency (DARPA). The emerging device and materials technologyis discussed. The major device development is categorized into four areas:sources and detectors integrated with electronics, two-dimensional spatiallight modulators, optical beam steering, and bistable optical devices.</TEXT></DOC>
