The rating concern also assigned a Caa rating to Price's proposed convertible senior subordinated debentures.    Regarding the downgrade, Moody's said that Price's operating cash flow was insufficent to meet its debt-service costs and that the gap between them would widen significantly over the near term.    Moody's said Price's pending sales of broadcast-television properties would cut into cash flow because it would require Price to take back notes and securities in companies whose risk rivals its own.    At the same time, Price's $50 million offering of convertible debentures would increase its debt-service expense, said Craig Fitt, assistant vice president at Moody's. About $350 million in long-term debt is affected by the downgrade and the rating for the proposed issue, Moody's said.    Price's high debt levels have been incurred partly as a result of its strategy of acquiring undervalued media properties in the expectation of reselling them at higher prices.    Price Communications officials couldn't be reached for comment. Price is a New York-based company engaged in television and radio broadcasting, publishing, outdoor advertising and cellular telephones. </TEXT></DOC>
