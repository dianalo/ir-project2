Despite faint hints that the contest might soon comealive, the nomination fight is being shaped by the stillnessthat continues to hang over political circles in Iowa, NewHampshire and other states that provide the early tests inthe presidential race.</LP><TEXT>   So, at a time when no nationally prominent Democrat isclimbing to the summits of New Hampshire's Presidential Rangeor lining up at an Iowa steak fry, it's increasingly clearthat the most important element of the 1992 race may turn outto be what isn't happening now.   Storefront headquarters aren't being leased in Des Moinesand Concord. Activists aren't being courted. Phone listsaren't being compiled. County, city and precinctorganizations aren't being cobbled together. Candidate teasaren't being held. The details of getting on ballots andfiling delegate slates aren't being mastered.   The upshot: Voters are in for the shortest presidentialrace in a generation. By this time in the 1988 electioncycle, Rep. Richard Gephardt of Missouri, who eventually wonthe Iowa caucuses, had spent 67 days in the state. So farthis year, the dozen likeliest Democratic contenders for1992, including the only announced candidate, former Sen.Paul Tsongas of Massachusetts, have together spent less thanhalf that many days in Iowa.   The late start is significantly changing the character ofpresidential politics. It will lead to a race that may costless, be far less intimate, give fewer openings tolittle-known candidates and perhaps even depend more onpolitical message than did other recent presidentialelections.   &quot;You had better know what you are going to say when you dorun, because you're not going to have the luxury of sortingthings out and experimenting,&quot; says Paul Maslin, a Democraticpolitical strategist. &quot;In the 1992 race, you have one chanceand no room to make mistakes.&quot;   The Gulf War and President Bush's formidable approvalratings kept Democrats out of the race in the winter andspring, and some Democrats fear that the late start will makethe uphill task of taking on Mr. Bush even more difficult.   &quot;The lack of candidates has left the field clear for theadministration to dominate public thought,&quot; frets formerDemocratic National Chairman John White. &quot;They're not beingchallenged the way they would be if we had two or three `A'players out there. There is a mind-set of inevitability outthere that is going to be very hard to turn around.&quot;   But his dismay over the slow start isn't evident at thegrass-roots level, where many activists, weary from a stringof Democratic disappointments, show little eagerness to rushinto battle.   &quot;No one is sorry nothing has happened yet,&quot; says JeanneShaheen, a New Hampshire Democrat whose early work helpedpave the way for Gary Hart's startling victory in the state's1984 primary. &quot;The primaries were getting out of hand. Therewas a lot of wasted time and effort.&quot;   This time, missed opportunities are outnumbering photoopportunities.   When New Hampshire's Democrats were planning the speakingprogram for their state convention late last year, they hadto plead with leading figures such as Sen. Sam Nunn ofGeorgia, Sen. Bob Kerrey of Nebraska and Rep. Gephardt, onlyto be shunned by them all. &quot;We simply couldn't find aheadline speaker for an event people would have fought forlast time,&quot; says Ned Helms, then the state chairman and nowrunning for governor.   State Democrats tried -- and failed -- again a few monthsago when they held their big fund-raiser for the year. NewYork Gov. Mario Cuomo has ducked a series of invitations toappear at Dartmouth. Laura Quinn, press secretary to Sen. JayRockefeller of West Virginia, fielded calls for a week fromreporters in Iowa and New Hampshire who asked which Fourth ofJuly picnic in their states the senator would attend.Instead, he stayed home with his family.   Even political journalists have made themselves scarce.&quot;The big reporting boys aren't even coming to visit,&quot; saysHugh Winebrenner, a professor of public administration atDrake University in Des Moines. &quot;They're just calling, andthey're not calling very often.&quot;   And even though it's the summer before the election year,&quot;candidates are still in the stage where they're talking thisover with their families, a year behind the usual schedule,&quot;says Elaine Kamarck, who in the past has worked for aDemocratic favorite, former Vice President Walter Mondale,and for a dark horse, former Arizona Gov. Bruce Babbitt. &quot;Noone has moved to the stage where they are raising money. Noone is putting together a team.&quot;   Last month, however, some potential candidates did maketwo important stops on the money trail, first by visiting agroup of Democratic fund-raisers assembled by MarylandDemocratic Chairman Nathan Landow, whose allies raised morethan $1 million for Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore in 1984, andthen by visiting leading Democratic contributors at thecountry home of party doyenne Pamela Harriman.   &quot;There hasn't been any fund raising because there hasn'tbeen a cause,&quot; Mr. Landow says. He estimates that eachcandidate needs to raise $6 million by Feb. 17, when the Iowacaucuses begin the process of selecting delegates to thenational convention in New York. But others believe that farless money and time will be needed, especially if Iowa Sen.Tom Harkin jumps in the race, diminishing the importance ofhis home state's caucuses.   It's almost too late anyway. Candidates have spent roughlyone-tenth as many days in Iowa this time as they did lasttime, and even if Mr. Harkin stays out of the race, a victoryin the much-scrutinized precinct caucuses is more likely toresemble a blitzkrieg than trench warfare.   &quot;If you're not spending money for a ground war in Iowa,what do you need a lot of money for?&quot; asks Michael McCurry,who has worked on the presidential campaigns of Sen. JohnGlenn and Mr. Babbitt. &quot;You can run a presidential campaignon the cheap this time. The candidates don't have to pay forinfrastructure. They have to spend mental capital on acampaign message.&quot;   Nearly all analysts say the presence of one well-financedcandidate such as Mr. Cuomo, who probably could raise moneyswiftly, might transform the race. That's especially true ifhugely expensive California, now planning to hold its primaryJune 2, approves a proposal to move it to early March, a weekafter New Hampshire's.   At the same time, the late start may make it harder forlittle-known figures to launch a presidential campaign, asMr. Gephardt did in 48 days of campaigning two years before1988 even began. &quot;They won't have the time to build anorganization and contact a lot of people face-to-face. Thatmakes a difference in the early states,&quot; says Larry Bartels,a University of Rochester political scientist.   Mr. Tsongas, who is on a two-week tour of Iowa, stillhasn't put together even the outlines of an organization thatcould muster an impressive turnout on caucus night. The Rev.Jesse Jackson, who is contemplating a third presidentialrace, has always generated interest in Iowa but has neverbeen able to build much of an organization there. Nor areother potential candidates selecting precinct captains andpondering how to lure Democrats to caucuses on a wintryevening.   So Iowa's caucuses, for two decades a test of organizationand willpower, may turn out in 1992 to be much like aprimary, where television advertisements are more important.&quot;You won't see presidential candidates paying $10,000 for alist of caucus Democrats,&quot; says Edward Campbell, a formerIowa Democratic chairman supporting Sen. Rockefeller. &quot;It'snot going to be that kind of game this time.&quot;   The final contours of the race won't be determined untilsome leading figures clarify their plans. Right now, thespeculation centers on Mr. Cuomo, who is still embroiled inbudget debates in Albany, and on others more actively testingthe waters: Mr. Jackson; Sens. Gore, Harkin and Rockefeller;and Govs. Bill Clinton of Arkansas and Douglas Wilder ofVirginia.   &quot;All these guys are doing this dance around the pond,waiting for someone to jump,&quot; says Carter Eskew, a politicalconsultant. &quot;Once one of them does, others will get in.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
