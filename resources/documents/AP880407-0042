(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The bitter Baby M custody fight ended withsurrogate mother Mary Beth Whitehead-Gould winning unsupervisedvisitation rights she says will allow ``a meaningful andsubstantial relationship'' with her daughter.   Superior Court Judge Birger M. Sween on Wednesday urged bothsides in the dispute to protect 2-year-old Melissa Stern, known tothe world as Baby M, by resolving their differences and keeping thechild out of the public eye.   ``The court does not underestimate the great difficulty theparties will have in accepting others' roles in Melissa's life,''Sween said in the ruling granting gradually expanded, unsupervisedvisitation to Mrs. Whitehead-Gould.   ``However, family tragedies in our society are not uncommon andparents often are called upon to make sacrifices arising fromunforseen circumstances,'' Sween said.   Mrs. Whitehead-Gould and Melissa's father, William Stern, andhis wife, Elizabeth, won't appeal Sween's ruling, bringing an endto a highly publicized dispute that sparked worldwide debate onreproduction technologies.   Sween also barred both sides from discussing publicly theirrelationships with Melissa, but allowed them to talk about theirexperiences in general. This clears the way for publication of Mrs.Whitehead-Gould's book. It has no effect on films or books writtenwithout the involvement of the people in the case.   Sween rejected the Sterns' contention during a three-day hearinglast week that Melissa would suffer psychologically by seeing Mrs.Whitehead-Gould and that the child had developed no emotionalattachment to her mother.   Mrs. Whitehead-Gould, who is 31 today, will have one six-hourvisit a week, under the ruling. Sween said the schedule will beexpanded during the next year to include overnight stays, holidaysand two weeks in the summer of 1989.   ``I am delighted and grateful to know that as Melissa grows upwe will have a meaningful and substantial relationship with eachother,'' Mrs. Whitehead-Gould said in a statement released by herlawyers.   ``I have struggled in order to preserve our relationship,'' shesaid. ``That relationship has been preserved; in fact, it will bestrenghthened and advanced.''   The Sterns, who have custody of Melissa and are both 42 yearsold, wanted Sween to delay for at least six years visits betweenMelissa and Mrs. Whitehead-Gould, who had been seeing the child fortwo hours once a week under supervision.   They were disappointed with the ruling on visitation, butpleased with the judge's decision on publicity, said Frank Donahue,one of the Tenafly couple's attorneys.   ``They wanted to put an end to the litigation and the publicityand protect Melissa,'' Donahue said.   The judge, in a written decision filed in Hackensack and madepublic here, said both sides must come to terms with their newrelationship.   The judge said Mrs. Whitehead-Gould must remember she is not theprimary caretaker for the child she named Sara but now callsMelissa. He said the Sterns will make parental decisions in suchareas as religion and education.   ``Mary Beth Whitehead-Gould must accept and understand thatMelissa is not Sara and that her father and stepmother will be herparental role models and provide the day-to-day, parent-childinteraction,'' Sween said.   ``William and Elizabeth Stern must accept and understand thatMelissa will develop a different and special relationship with hermother, stepfather, siblings and extended family, and that theserelationships need not dminish their parent-child relationship withMelissa,'' Sween said.   The tug-of-war began after Mrs. Whitehead-Gould, then married toRichard Whitehead, agreed to be artificially inseminated withStern's sperm.   She gave birth to Melissa on March 31, 1986, but decided torefuse the $10,000 surrogate fee and keep the baby.   That led to a landmark New Jersey Supreme Court ruling, whichoutlawed surrogacy-for-pay, restored Mrs. Whitehead-Gould'sparental rights, upheld custody for the Sterns and ordered thelower court hearing on visitation rights.   Mrs. Whitehead-Gould has since divorced Whitehead and marriedDean Gould. The couple, from East Brunswick, is expecting a childsoon.   In a related development, a Florida Senate committee Wednesdayapproved a bill that would make it a felony to accept a fee to beara child.</TEXT></DOC>
