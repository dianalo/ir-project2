But there are still more than 30 million people -- 11 million of them children -- who have no health insurance whatsoever. When these people get sick, they often receive care -- but frequently the care is late or in the highest-cost setting.    We all pay for the medical bills that the uninsured cannot pay -- to the tune of more than $7 billion a year. Uncompensated care is now a hodgepodge of hidden subsidies, inflated bills, and redistributed resources in both the private and public insurance systems. In effect, doctors, hospitals and other providers have been expected to serve the medically indigent and to pass along the cost through higher charges to taxpayers, paying patients and insurers.    Never an efficient system, these hidden subsidies are now being rapidly eroded as businesses and private insurers have aggressively tried to lower the soaring cost of health care. Such techniques as preferred provider organizations, utilization reviews, cost-sharing with employees, and tough bargaining with hospitals and doctors are making it nearly impossible for healthcare providers to continue to shift the cost of charity cases and bad debts to paying patients and insurers. Government, too, is putting the squeeze on costs as it gains experience with prospective payment under Medicare and other measures.    As the hidden &quot;taxes&quot; are eliminated, we should devise new direct subsidies to help the needy. This step is not only humane; it is also vital to preserve and extend the gains from making health-care markets more competitive.    No one in this country should be denied reasonable access to health care because he is too poor to buy insurance on his own. A combination of private and public actions can greatly expand health coverage to many more Americans, while at the same time building more cost discipline into the health-care sector.    More than half of uninsured Americans are full-time, full-year private-sector workers and members of their families. Most do not have health insurance because they work at jobs paying under $10,000 a year for small employers often hard-pressed to offer group health benefits. The extremely high cost of purchasing health insurance on an individual basis makes it virtually impossible for these workers to care for themselves and their families on their own.    Many of the remaining uninsured are the poor who, for various reasons, do not qualify for Medicaid, the state-federal program that provides insurance for certain low-income groups. Today, only about half of the poor are eligible for Medicaid, down from about two-thirds a decade ago.    One reason for this is that most of the poor receive Medicaid through eligibility for Aid to Families with Dependent Children, and the states set their own AFDC requirements.    Therefore, even for some of the very poorest, getting Medicaid health coverage is more an accident of where you live than what your family may need. For example, if the head of a family of four in Alabama has an adjusted income of $1,764 a year -- one-sixth of the federal poverty line -- the family earns too much to qualify for AFDC and therefore Medicaid. However, the same family could have an adjusted income of as much as $8,808 a year in California and still qualify for Medicaid.    Clearly there are gross inequities in the Medicaid system, and major reforms are needed to bring health coverage to the poor who happen to live in the wrong state. But government alone cannot be expected to solve all of the health-care problems of the medically indigent, especially since most of the uninsured are working full time in the private sector.    Many of the working poor could afford health insurance if business groups such as local chambers of commerce and health-care coalitions working with insurance companies could make group policies available to small employers and individuals. One vehicle is the multiemployer trust. Another approach involves statewide risk pools. Sponsors of these group plans would, of course, need to establish rules that prevent employees entering and leaving the plan according to their own or their dependents' medical conditions.    Employers also could negotiate with hospitals and other medical-care providers to recognize openly that indigent care is a legitimate part of provider overhead. Although no one employer or hospital could reasonably be asked to underwrite such uncompensated care, sharing among a large number of bill-payers could address costs without creating an undue burden. For example, employers could agree to shave one or two points from discounts negotiated with hospitals or groups of doctors. This added payment would be directed toward a pool for uncompensated care.    If employers wish to avoid inflexible government mandates, they must find ways to pool risks and extend basic health-care coverage to more uninsured workers.    While the private sector can do much to bring health benefits to working Americans, major reforms are needed to bring better balance to Medicaid. At a minimum, the federal government should establish a floor on AFDC benefits to ensure that at least the poorest of the poor in every state are eligible for Medicaid. In addition, Medicaid should be extended to cover more people who fall between the threshold for eligibility for welfare cash assistance and the federal poverty line.    The long-term solution to providing health care for the poor, however, should involve separating government aid for health care from welfare entirely. This can be done by moving toward a program of refundable tax credits that would allow the poor to purchase private insurance on their own. In effect, this program would replace the current Medicaid system with one that issues the poor and near-poor specially earmarked subsidies geared to the cost of basic health insurance in their areas. This could be accomplished either through refundable tax credits or a sliding-scale voucher approach.    Giving the poor and the near-poor a fixed-dollar cash subsidy to buy a pre-approved health-insurance plan will not only bring greater market discipline to health care but also, for the first time, allow many of the poor access to mainstream American medical care that so many of us take for granted.    How will we pay for all this? When leaders in community business groups and health coalitions debate the cost of devising ways to offer group insurance to small employers and individuals, they would do well to recognize that they already pay a large portion of the cost of uncompensated care in their communities. Greater use of market incentives will pave the way for more equitable and cost-sensitive health care. Part of these cost savings can and should be used to finance indigent care.    There is no denying that bringing more of the poor into Medicaid will cost money. A 1985 congressional study estimated the first-year cost of one proposal to mandate a minimum cash-assistance benefit level and extend eligibility for AFDC and Medicaid at a little more than $5 billion.    Whatever the eventual cost, Medicaid reform must be fully funded. It would be a mistake to rely on additions to the federal deficit to underwrite new commitments to those in need. There are means at the federal government's disposal to fund these commitments, but it requires greater leadership and stronger political will.    For example, more Social Security and some Medicare benefits could be included in taxable income. To share the government's financing burden with the working population, a portion of employee health-insurance benefits (now tax-free) could be taxed. Other options include excise taxes on alcohol and cigarettes combined with cutbacks in other government programs.    Far too often, debates on health care focus on lowering costs -- at all cost. While cost containment is an essential goal, health-care dollars should be seen as an investment that will, if wisely spent, ensure a healthy and productive society.    Competition, cost containment and compassion can go hand in hand in reshaping our nation's health-insurance systems. It is up to private and public leadership in this country to see that they do.    ---   Mr. Woodside, chairman of the executive committee of Primerica Corp., chaired the panel that prepared a health-care study for the Committee for Economic Development, a group of 225 business and education leaders. </TEXT></DOC>
