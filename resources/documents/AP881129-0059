(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Tornado-shocked victims tried to put theirshattered lives and homes back in order today from a series oftwisters that killed four people, including a couple found withtheir arms wrapped around each other.   At least 17 tornadoes were reported early Monday, covering 200miles of eastern North Carolina, injuring 151 people and causingmore than $50 million in damage.   One tornado sent one couple on a flying-mattress ride. Mark andVera Cimerro landed on their mattress against a tree across thestreet.   ``I held onto her as tight as I could, and the next thing I know,we are flying,'' said Cimerro. ``It was like a ride at the fair.''   Their home was destroyed but they were not seriously injured.   A neighbor, 8-year-old Janet Barnes, died when a chimneycollapsed on her bed.   Further north in Raleigh, 12-year-old Edwin ``Pete'' Fulghum diedof head and chest injuries.   In rural Nash County, Lee Roy Alston died with his arms wrappedaround his fatally injured wife, Mary, apparently in an effort toshield her from the tornado that destroyed their mobile home,authorities said. They had been thrown from the mobile home. Theirtwo children, ages 14 and 8, survived.   Authorities had put the death toll at six, but later corrected itto four.   The tornadoes struck in nine counties, from Wake in the center ofthe state, to Dare on the Atlantic Coast, authorities said. Most ofthe damage was in Raleigh, where tornadoes cut a 10-mile swath.   City Manager Dempsey Benton said the storm caused about $50million in damage in Raleigh, the state capital. With about 85percent of estimates completed, about 152 businesses and residentialbuildings were destroyed, 301 buildings received major damage and644 buildings minor damage, he said.   About 500 people were left homeless in Raleigh.   Damage estimates from other counties were not compiled.   The storms brought reminders of the 24 twisters that ripped a250-mile path through the state in 1984, killing 44 people, injuringmore than 800 and leaving 2,300 homeless.   Gov. Jim Martin asked the federal Small Business Administrationto declare Wake County a disaster area.   The American Red Cross in Wake County got so many offers ofassistance that the agency ended up turning away some would-bevolunteers. Organizations rallied to supply everything from freelegal advice to tips about home repairs.   The twisters destroyed mobile homes, damaged churches, toppledseveral houses onto their sides and threw power lines onto housesand streets.   A K mart store was flattened by the twister, and six Raleighresidents, including four juveniles, were charged Monday withlooting the store.   More than 6,500 homes were left without power, but by Mondaynight electricity had been restored to all but 1,100 customers ofCarolina Power andamp; Light, said spokesman Kyle Hampton said.   By nightfall Monday, most of those whose homes were damaged hadfound somewhere to spend the night, either checking into hotels andmotels or staying with friends and relatives, authorities said.   Only 17 people from five families spent the night at a Raleighmiddle school, the only shelter in Wake County, said Gloria Brown ofthe county Department of Social Services.   More than 300 families opened their homes to those affected bythe storm, said Helen Sibley, nurse coordinator for the local RedCross chapter.   ``That's why there are not more people in the shelter,'' shesaid. ``People in the city don't think other people care much aboutthem, but when something like this happens, we come together.''   Farmers also suffered losses in the storms, said Jim Graham,state Commissioner of Agriculture. Several egg production houses, 12tobacco barns, 2,000 acres of timber, and two hog operations weredestroyed, Graham said.   There were also losses of livestock in Wake, Halifax and Nashcounties.   ``If federal disaster status is appropriate, I'll press for itwith all I've got,'' Graham said.   The National Weather Service did not begin issuing tornadowarnings until 38 minutes after the first tornado touched down inwestern Wake County because the twister was too close to radar tomonitor, authorities say.   ``If you are looking straight up at a storm you can't see much,''said Rod Gonski, a meteorologist with the weather service at RaleighDurham International Airport.   In neighboring Virginia, one tornado and high wind downed trees,damaged property and knocked out power in Isle of Wight, Brunswickand Southampton counties early Monday, but no injuries were reported.   At another scene of tornado damage, officials in Ruleville,Miss., have decided there will be no classes for children there forat least a week and preparations will be made to move high schoolstudents to an empty building in a nearby town.   A tornado cut a 60-foot-wide swath through Ruleville on Saturday,destroying six homes and damaging the Delta town's three publicschools and other structures.</TEXT></DOC>
