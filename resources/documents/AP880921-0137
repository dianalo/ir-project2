The U.S. presidential election makes it hard to hammer out theincredibly complex details of a START agreement during Reagan'sremaining four months in office, particularly the inspectionregimes needed to verify proposed 30 percent to 50 percent cuts instrategic weapons systems.   Besides the devilish details, however, the United States hasreached an impasse in its own strategic planning that vastlycomplicates efforts to conclude an arms control treaty, anagreement that would govern the deployment of American forces fordecades.   Shevardnadze, who was arriving Wednesday afternoon, was to meetThursday with Reagan, Secretary of State George Shultz and VicePresident George Bush.   The talks, say U.S. officials, will concentrate mainly on thenon-arms aspects of the administration's four-point agenda:bilateral relations, human rights and multilateral issues such asthe withdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan and Cuban troopsfrom Angola.   Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev made littleprogress on arms control at the June summit in Moscow, and movementwill probably be slow well into the next administration, accordingto many observers in the administration and on Capitol Hill.   The three key stumbling blocks are the Star Wars program todevelop land-and space-based anti-missile weapons, the developmentand deployment of mobile intercontinental ballistic missiles(ICBMs), and whether to control submarine launched cruise missiles(SLCMs).   The Soviets oppose a START deal without a U.S. commitment thatStar Wars research will not break the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missiletreaty for a set period of time, probably eight to 10 years.   The Soviets also want the United States to agree to a limit onnuclear-tipped submarine-launched cruise missiles, above theoverall 6,000-warhead limit agreed upon in the proposed STARTtreaty.   On the third major issue, the United States is pressing for aban on all ground-launched mobile ICBM's, which would require theSoviets to dismantle their already deployed SS-24 and SS-25 mobilemissiles.   The United States has not decided whether or how to deploy amobile missile. The administration and Congress are sparring onwhether to develop a 10-warhead rail-mobile MX missile, similar tothe Soviet SS-24, or a single-warhead road-mobile Midgetman,similar to the Soviet SS-25.   Reagan vetoed Congress' defense authorization bill for thefiscal year beginning Oct. 1 in part because it provided only about$4 billion for Star Wars versus the administration request of $4.8billion, and because Congress insisted that Star Wars tests notviolate the ABM pact.   The potential conflict between the ABM treaty and Star Wars,formally known as the Strategic Defense Initiative or SDI, hasdominated public discussion of arms control for years.   But it may be diverting attention from other crucial issues.Even SDI advocates such as former White House national securityadviser Robert McFarlane acknowledge that ``we do not know andcannot know for the next 10 or 15 years'' whether SDI's ``defensivetechnologies provide the means to defend us against ballisticmissiles.   U.S. negotiators have rejected Soviet proposals for puttinglimits on nuclear-tipped submarine-launched cruise missiles,weaponry in which the United States holds a technological andnumerical lead.   ``We have not seen any way to verify such limits without, ineffect, giving up our Navy'' to Soviet inspection and control,Assistant Secretary of Defense Ron Lehman in an interview last week.   Despite the U.S. lead in cruise missiles launched by submarines,this could turn out to be a problem for the United States in thefuture.   Although the Soviets have fewer cruise missiles deployed aboardtheir submarines, they have the world's densest anti-aircraftsystem, estimated by the Pentagon to consist of 12,000 missiles.And most Soviet cities and military targets are located deep withinthe country, presenting slow-moving cruise missiles with a longpotential flight time.   The United States, in contrast, has virtually no anti-airdefenses along its extensive coastlines, and major U.S. cities lieright on the east and west coasts.   Shortly before Reagan flew to Moscow for the summit there, theHouse Armed Services Committee issued a report urging theadministration to take a long, hard look at U.S. strategic forces,and determine what it wanted before concluding a new arms controlaccord. The treaty appears no closer than it did then, but neitherdoes domestic agreement on the shape of the U.S. strategic arsenal.</TEXT><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE><TEXT>   Bryan Brumley has been covering U.S.-Sovietrelations for The Associated Press since 1981.</TEXT></DOC>
