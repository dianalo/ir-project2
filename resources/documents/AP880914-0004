The hurricane killed at least five people Sunday in theDominican Republic, civil defense officials said. Six people diedand 60,000 were left homeless in Jamaica on Monday, officials theresaid.   Prime Minister Edward Seaga said the hurricane swept the fulllength of Jamaica, ``leaving a trail of wreckage behind it.''   ``It will take us some time before we can assess the full damagewithout any doubt,'' Seaga said in a statement. ``But I have nodoubt that this going to be the worst disaster that we haveexperienced in our modern history.''   Communications were down with many storm-ravaged areas and thedeath toll was expected to rise with the arrival of damage andcasualty reports.   The hurricane, traveling westward across the Caribbean Sea, wasupgraded Tuesday to a Category 5, the strongest and deadliest typeof hurricane. Such storms have maximum sustained winds greater than155 mph and can cause catastrophic damage.   Bob Sheets, director of the National Hurricane Center in CoralGables, Fla., described Gilbert as ``a great hurricane ... in thetop 10 percent (historically) as far as intensity, size anddestructive potential.''   Only two Category 5 hurricanes have hit the United States _ a1935 storm that killed 408 people in Florida, and HurricaneCamille, which devastated the Mississippi coast in 1969 and killed256 people.   ``The people who need to be concerned now are those people overon the Yucatan Peninsula _ Cancun, Cozumel, that whole area,''Sheets said.   Mexico's news media reported beachfront hotels were evacuated inthe Yucatan resorts of Cancun and Cozumel Island.   They gave no figures on the numer of evacuees, but said peoplein Cancun were being sent from the hotel zone into the city center,about 6 miles away.   Cozumel is south of Cancun and the reports said hotel guestsalso were being moved to more secure areas away from the shoreline.   Mexican officials expected the storm to hit in the early morninghours Wednesday.   At midnight EDT the U.S. National Weather Service said Gilbertwas centered near latitude 19.9 north, longitude 84.8 west, orabout 150 miles east-southeast of Cozumel.   It said Gilbert was moving west-northwest at about 15 mph withmaximum sustained winds of 175 mph. The center said tropicalstorm-force winds extend outward up to 250 miles to the north and200 miles to the south of the center.   ``People in the warned areas should have completed all possiblepreparations for this extremely dangerous hurricane,'' it said.   The center said Hurricane Gilbert was the most intense storm onrecord in terms of barometric pressure. It said by 8 p.m. EDT itwas measured at 26.13 inches, breaking the 26.35 inches recordedfor the 1935 hurricane that devastated the Florida Keys.   ``That's the lowest pressure ever measured in the WesternHemisphere,'' said forecaster Mark Zimmer.   ``There is very serious flooding'' in the Cayman Islands, ErinaNichols, a tourism official in Miami, said Tuesday after speakingwith residents of the islands. ``The Run Point (community) istaking a real beating.''   The storm later knocked out all telephone service to the CaymanIslands, a British dependency of 23,000 people that was expecting12-foot tides.   Warren Chase, an amateur radio operator in Fort Myers, Fla.,said he received a report of sailboat with seven people aboardmissing near the Cayman Islands.   Oil companies evacuated thousands of workers from rigs in theGulf of Mexico, according to reports from New Orleans.   Gene Graves, marketing director for Petroleum Helicopters Inc.in Lafayette, La., said his company's 18 helipads were working atfull capacity to evacuate about 10,000 oil rigs in the Gulf ofMexico.   The Cuban news agency Prensa Latina said 40,000 people, many ofthem foreign vacationers and students, were evacuated Tuesday fromthe Isle of Youth off the southwestern coast as the hurricanepassed 200 miles to the south.   In New York City, a ham radio operator who was monitoringamateur radio communications in Jamaica said Tuesday, ``Kingston isdevastated, Montego Bay is hit hard and Ocho Rios is flooded.   The operator, Norm Chwat, an officer with the American Red CrossRadio Club, said therth coast had been wrecked by thehurricane.   Herb Schoenbaum, a radio ham operator in the Virgin Islands,said he spoke Tuesday with Dave Porter, an American staying in theWyndham Hotel on Jamaica's Montego Bay. ``Porter reported that thehotel `peeled apart like a banana' when the force of HurricaneGilbert hit last night,'' Schoenbaum said.   ``This morning he says there is just nothing left. Boats thatwere on the beach, the little rental Sailfishes or Sunfishes, weredriven into cars like spears _ power lines down, almost every treein the area is on the ground.''   Schoenbaum said Porter told him people who were trying to enterthe hotel on their hands and knees at the height of the storm wereswept into the ocean.   Glenn Baxter of Belgrade Lakes, Me., said he spoke with a hamoperator in Jamaica who told him the roof of a hospital inMandeville ripped off ``and the hospital has caved in. And that isthe worst horror show that I've heard about because that wouldimply that a lot of people could have been hurt.''   The Jamaican consulate in Miami said today it had n immediateinformation on the extent of damages or casualties.   Jamaica was still out of contact with the rest of the world bytelephone.   Roger Myers, southern regional spokesman for the FederalAviation Administration in Atlanta, said both internationalairports in Jamaica are closed. ``We've been told the governmenthas asked commercial radio stations to remain silent so RadioJamaica can broadcast information,'' Myers said.</TEXT></DOC>
