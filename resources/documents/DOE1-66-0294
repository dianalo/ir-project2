The proposed action is to demarcatethis area and restrict its use to activities that will not disturb thissubsurface contamination. The proposed action would allow unrestricteduse of the balance of the formerly utilized site. The proposed remedialaction will be minor and, thus, will cause negligible disruption of thesocioeconomic or environmental systems in which the site exists. Theaction will not threaten any legally protected species of flora or fauna,nor will it threaten any legally protected cultural or historical resources.Because the local community is familiar with radiation and has expressedno concern to date, it is expected that future public concern will below. The DOE is ensuring that county authorities remain aware of allproposed remedial activities in the area.</TEXT></DOC>
