Other researchers (e.g.,those employed by private companies, institutions, non-United States organizations,non-profit organizations, etc.) are encouraged to use the ``Points to Consider.''Experiments in which recombinant DNA is introduced into cells of a humansubject with the intent of stably modifying the subject's genome are coveredby Section III-A-4 of the NIH Guidelines for Research Involving RecombinantDNA Molecules (51 FR 16958). Section III-A-4 applies both to recombinantDNA and to DNA or RNA derived from recombinant DNA. <ITAG tagnum="84">Introduction </ITAG>(1) Section III-A-4 requires experiments involving the transfer of recombinantDNA into human subjects be reviewed by the NIH Recombinant DNA AdvisoryCommittee (RAC) and approved by the NIH. RAC consideration of each proposalwill be on a case-by-case basis and will follow publication of a precisof the proposal in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>, an opportunity for public comment, and a reviewof the proposal by the Human Gene Therapy Subcommittee of the RAC. RACrecommendations on each proposal will be forwarded to the NIH Directorfor a decision which will then be published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>. In accordance with Section IV-C-1-b of the NIHGuidelines, the NIH Director may approve proposals only if he finds thatthey present ``no significant risk to health or the environment.'' (2) In general, it is expected that the transfer of recombinant DNA intohuman subjects will not present a risk to the environment as the recombinantDNA is expected to be confined to the human subject. Nevertheless, SectionI-B-4-b of the ``Points to Consider'' document specifically asks the researchersto address this point. (3) This document is intended to provide guidance in preparing proposalsfor NIH consideration under Section III-A-4 of the NIH Guidelines for ResearchInvolving Recombinant DNA Molecules. The document will be considered forrevision as experience in evaluating proposals accumulates and as new scientificdevelopments occur. This review will be carried out periodically as needed.(4) A proposal will be considered by the RAC only after the protocol hasbeen approved by the local Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBC) andby the local Institutional Review Board (IRB) in accordance with Departmentof Health and Human Services (DHHS) Regulations for the Protection of HumanSubjects (45 Code of Federal Regulations, Part 46). If a proposal involveschildren, special attention should be paid to subpart D of these DHHS regulations.The IRB and IBC may, at their discretion, condition their approval on furtherspecific deliberation by the RAC and its Subcommittee. Consideration ofproposals by the RAC may proceed simultaneously with review by any otherinvolved federal agencies (See Footnote 1) provided that the RAC is notifiedof the simultaneous review. Meetings of the Committee and the Subcommitteewill be open to the public except where trade secrets or proprietary informationwould be disclosed. The Committee prefers that the first proposals submittedfor RAC review contain no proprietary information or trade secrets, enablingall aspects of the review to be open to the public. The public review ofthese protocols will serve to inform the public not only on the technicalaspects of the proposals but also on the meaning and significance of theresearch. (5) The clinical application of recombinant DNA techniques raises two generalkinds of questions: (1) The questions usually discussed by IRBs in theirreview of any proposed research involving human subjects; and (2) broaderissues. The first type of question is addressed principally in Part I ofthis document. Several broader issues are discussed later in this Introductionand in Part II below.(6) Following the Introduction, this document is divided into four parts.Part I requests a description of the protocol with special attention tothe short-term risks and benefits of the proposed research to the patient(See Footnote 2) and to other people, the selection of patients, informedconsent, and privacy and confidentiality. In Part II, investigators arerequested to address special issues pertaining to the free flow of informationabout the clinical trials. These issues lie outside the usual purview ofIRBs and reflect general public concerns about biomedical research. PartIII summarizes other requested documentation that will assist the RAC andits Subcommittee in their review of the proposals. Part IV specifies reportingrequirements. (7) The RAC and its Subcommittee will not at present entertain proposalsfor germ line alterations but will consider for approval protocols involvingsomatic cell gene therapy. The purpose of somatic cell gene therapy isto treat an individual patient, e.g., by inserting a properly functioninggene into a patient's somatic cells. In germ line alterations, a specificattempt is made to introduce genetic changes into the germ (reproductive)cells of an individual, with the aim of changing the set of genes passedon to the individual's offspring. (8) The acceptability of human somatic cell gene therapy has been addressedin several public documents as well as in numerous academic studies. TheNovember 1982 report of the President's Commission for the Study of EthicalProblems in Medicine and Biomedical and Behavorial Research, Splicing Life,resulted from a two-year process of public deliberations and hearings;upon release of that report, a House subcommittee held three days of publichearings with witnesses from a wide range of fields from the biomedicaland social sciences to theology, philosophy, and law. In December 1984,the Office of Technology Assessment released a background paper, HumanGene Therapy, which concluded:<ITAG tagnum="21">Civic, religious, scientific, and medical groups have all accepted,in principle, the appropriateness of gene therapy of somatic cells in humansfor specific genetic diseases. Somatic cell gene therapy is seen as anextension of present methods of therapy that might be preferably to othertechnologies.</ITAG>In light of this, the RAC is prepared to consider proposals for somaticcell gene therapy. (9) The RAC and its Subcommittee are also prepared to consider for approvalproposals involving the transfer of recombinant DNA into human subjects,provided that the design of such experiments offers adequate assurancethat their consequences will not go beyond their purpose, which is thesame as the traditional purpose of all clinical investigations, namely,to benefit the health and well-being of the individual being treated whileat the same time gathering generalizable knowledge. (10) Two possible undesirable consequences of the transfer of recombinantDNA would be unintentional: (1) Vertical transmission of genetic changesfrom an individual to his or her offspring or (2) horizontal transmissionof viral infection to other persons with whom the individual comes in contact.Accordingly, this document requests information that will enable the RACand its Subcommittee to assess the likelihood that the proposed experimentswill inadvertently affect reproductive cells or lead to infection of otherpeople (e.g., treatment personnel or relatives). (11) In recognition of the social concern that surrounds the general discussionof recombinant DNA, the Subcommittee will continue to consider the possiblelong-range effects of applying knowledge gained from these and relatedexperiments. While research in molecular biology could lead to the developmentof techniques for germ line intervention or for the use of genetic meansto enhance human capabilities rather than to correct defects in patients,the Subcommittee does not believe that these effects will follow immediatelyor inevitably from experiments with somatic cell gene therapy. The Subcommitteewill cooperate with other groups in assessing the possible long-term consequencesof the transfer of recombinant DNA and related laboratory and animal experimentsin order to define appropriate human applications of this emerging technology.(12) Responses to the questions raised in these ``Points to Consider''should be provided in the form of either written answers or referencesto specific sections of the protocol or its appendices. (13) Investigators should indicate points which are not applicable witha brief explanation. Investigators submitting proposals that employ essentiallythe same vector systems (or with minor variations), and/or that are basedon the same preclinical testing as proposals previously reviewed by theRAC, may refer to preceding documents without having to rewrite materialalready reviewed by the Human Gene Therapy Subcommittee and the RAC.

Reports regarding the general progress of patients should be filed withboth your local IRB and ORDA within 6 months of the commencement of theexperiment and at six-month intervals thereafter. These twice-yearly reportsshould continue for a sufficient period of time to allow observation ofall major effects. In the event of a patient's death, a summary of thespecial post mortem studies and statement of the cause of death shouldbe submitted to the IRB and ORDA, if available.<ITAG tagnum="84">Footnotes:</ITAG>1.

The term ``patient'' and its variants are used in the text as a shorthanddesignation for ``patient-subject.''OMB's ``Mandatory Information Requirements for Federal Assistance ProgramAnnouncements'' (45 FR 39592) requires a statement concerning the officialgovernment programs contained in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance.Normally NIH lists in its announcements the number and title of affectedindividual programs for the guidance of the public. Because the guidancein this notice covers not only virtually every NIH program but also essentiallyevery Federal research program in which DNA recombinant molecule techniquescould be used, it has been determined to be not cost effective or in thepublic interest to attempt to list these programs. Such a list would likelyrequire several additional pages. In addition, NIH could not be certainthat every Federal program would be included as many Federal agencies,as well as private organizations, both national and international, haveelected to follow the NIH Guidelines. In lieu of the individual programlisting, NIH invites readers to direct questions to the information addressabove about whether individual programs listed in the Catalog of FederalDomestic Assistance are affected.<ITAG tagnum="34">Dated: June 15, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Jay Moskowitz,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Associate Director for Science Policy and Legislation.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="40">[FR Doc. 89-14852 Filed 6-22-89; 8:45 am]</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4140-01-M</ITAG></ITAG></ITAG></TEXT></DOC>
