More particularly, this inventionrelates to secondary or tertiary recovery of oil employing a polymer-thickenedaqueous drive fluid. The polymeric viscosifier for the drive fluid isselected from a class of hydrophobically associating, water soluble polymerscontaining one or more water soluble monomers and a water insoluble monomergroup. The water soluble groups are acrylamide and a salt of acrylicacid and the water insoluble group is a higher alkylacrylamide. Thesepolymers, when dissolved in an aqueous brine solution, have the abilityto substantially increase the viscosity of the aqueous solution. Thecontrol of displacement fluid mobility results in more uniform sweepefficiency and improved oil recovery. In addition, aqueous solutionsof these hydrophobically associating polymers exhibit enhanced viscosification,reduced salt sensitivity and other desirable rheological properties founduseful in chemically enhanced oil recovery processes.</TEXT></DOC>
