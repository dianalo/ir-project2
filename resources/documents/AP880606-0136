In rare move, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board closed AmericanDiversified Savings Bank and North America Savings and LoanAssociation, both of Costa Mesa, without arranging for a takeover byanother institution.   Only 10 of 235 failed Sandamp;Ls handled since 1981 have been resolvedwith a straight payoff of depositors. Usually, the bank board pays abonus to a healthy thrift to buy a sick Sandamp;L because it is cheaper.At the very least, the board arranges to transfer deposits toanother institution.   But bank board Chairman M. Danny Wall said the uniquecharacteristics of the two Costa Mesa thrifts made that impractical.They had little value as going concerns because they had few retaildeposits and lacked branch offices, he said.   Both also relied on high-cost, short-term deposits arrangedthrough brokers, which they in turn lent out for speculative realestate ventures and other risky investments.   Both institutions have been insolvent for some time. Regulatorstook over the management of American Diversified in February 1986and of North America in January 1987.   The bank board is paying $1.14 billion from the Federal Savingsand Loan Insurance Corp. to American Diversified depositors in whatWall said was the largest cash payout his agency has made. It iscovering $209 million in deposits at North America.   Deposits up to the insurance limit of $100,000 will be availablebeginning Tuesday. A total of about $500,000 in both institutionsexceeded the limit. Those depositors will share in liquidationproceeds.   ``These two represented abuses,'' bank board member LawrenceWhite said in an interview. ``The whole essence of being adepository institution with governement-provided insurance is thatthere is a strong ... obligation to operate in a safe and soundmanner. These two places did not.''   Prior to American Diversified, the largest cash payout was $300million in 1984 to close the Empire Savings and Loan of Mesquite,Texas.   However, in transactions over the last year the bank board hasbailed out insolvent institutions for as much as $2 billion, withmost of the assistance coming in the form of notes or guaranteesagainst certain kinds of future loss, not cash.   The bank board expects to recover about $400 million from thesale of the Costa Mesa Sandamp;Ls' assets. It estimates the ultimate costof closing American Diversified at $798 million and of North Americaat $133 million.   The closing of the California associations leaves the insurancefund with about $1.9 billion in cash to handle problems elsewhere,including the Southwest, where a downturn in the oil industry haspushed many thrifts into insolvency. However, it has the power toborrow money if necessary and is expecting $465 million in insurancepremiums from healthy Sandamp;Ls this month.   Regulators have said they will have about $20 billion over threeyears, more than enough to resolve the cases of the 200 worst Sandamp;Ls.   However, the General Accounting Office, Congress' auditing wing,puts the cost of cleaning up all 500 insolvent Sandamp;Ls between $26billion and $36 billion and says Congress may have to come up withmore money for the fund. Private analysts put the pricetag at morethan $50 billion.   Wall said closing the two California thrifts will help all Sandamp;Lsby reducing pressure to pay high interest rates. Failing thrifts hadto pay high rates to get the cash needed to meet expenses and somehealthy thrifts have had to raise their rates to compete.   North America was paying 8.53 percent interest on deposits, 1.45percentage points above the average for all thrift institutions.American Diversified was paying 8.64 percent.   Bert Ely, a financial institutions analyst in Alexandria, Va.,said the two Costa Mesa Sandamp;Ls were prime examples of ``severalscore'' high-flying institutions that in the early and mid-1980sused federally guaranteed deposits to fuel rapid growth of shakylending. Regulators were unprepared for the boom and failed to checkit, he said.   ``It was a systemic breakdown. What we are seeing are two of themore extreme examples of it. But they're not the only ones outthere. There are others,'' Ely said.   American Diversified's assets ballooned from $11 million inmid-1983 to $792 million at the end of 1984. But most of the assetswere undocumented and unsecured loans for real estate and technologyventures, the bank board said.   As of March 31, American Diversified had $509 million in assetsand $1.12 billion in liabilities. It was losing an estimated $8.3million a month, and 77 percent of its loans were bad.   North America had $98.2 million in assets and $215.7 million inliabilities at the end of March. It was losing an estimated $1.59million a month, and 98 percent of its borrowers weren't makingpayments.</TEXT></DOC>
