Whether the higher risk of death results from poorer caregiven to uninsured patients, or from other factors, isn'tdetermined, but the report also concludes that the uninsuredare sicker when they are admitted to the hospital, and theyare less likely to undergo high-cost procedures and teststhan their insured counterparts.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;Health insurance coverage seems to make a difference inthe whole spectrum of care,&quot; says Jack Hadley, co-director ofthe center for health-policy studies, Georgetown University,and lead author of the study.   Some health-policy analysts have argued that insuredpatients often get unnecessary health care and that anadequate safety net is there when anyone -- insured or not --truly needs care. &quot;These findings suggest that might not beas true as people would like it to be,&quot; Mr. Hadley says. Anestimated 33 million Americans lack health insurance.   Previous studies have linked poor health insurancecoverage to lack of access to health care. This report,published in today's Journal of the American MedicalAssociation, is one of the few large studies to look at therelationship between insurance and patient outcomes.   Mr. Hadley said he was surprised to see significantdifferences in death rates between insured and uninsured,figuring that such variations in outcome would turn up onlyin more subtle and hard-to-measure indicators, such asmobility, pain and quality of life.   Researchers based their findings on an analysis ofdischarge records for 592,598 patients from ages 1 to 64 whowere hospitalized in the U.S. in 1987. They divided thepatients into 16 different groups based on age, sex and race.   In 13 of the groups, uninsured patients were 44% to 124%sicker than insured patients on admission, based on aseverity-of-illness measure, possibly reflecting theirinability or reluctance to seek care earlier in the course ofillness. After adjusting for such differences, researchersstill found that the in-hospital death rate among theuninsured was 1.2 to 3.2 times higher than the rate forinsured patients in 11 of the groups.   While lack of needed care could account for somedifferences, the authors say, among other possibleexplanations is that insured patients were transferred tonursing homes or hospices to die, while such options werelimited for the uninsured.   The study also found uninsured patients were less likelyto undergo discretionary high-cost procedures, such ascoronary bypass surgery, and hip or knee replacement.However, there were no significant differences in use ofexpensive imaging procedures to diagnose head injuries. &quot;Theless directly associated with a life and death situation, theless likely an uninsured person would receive thatprocedure,&quot; Mr. Hadley says.   That finding suggests that &quot;doctors and hospitals aretrying to behave ethically, and balance the medical needs ofa patient against their own financial concerns,&quot; he says, buthigher mortality among the uninsured suggests that &quot;we're notalways able to do that as well as we hope or would like.&quot;   Judith Feder, also of Georgetown University and Earl P.Steinberg of the Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, wereco-authors of the report.</TEXT></DOC>
