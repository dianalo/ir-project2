(IBM SQL/DS data base system)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Gibson, Stanley.andM;</AUTHOR><TEXT><ABSTRACT>IBM is developing two versions of its SQL/DS data base managementsystem, one running under the VM operating system and another,less-functional version designed for the VSE system.andP;  The VMversion will be fully SAA-compliant and will more closely resemblethe company's flagship DB2 data base.andP;  Queries written under SAASQL guidelines can currently access both DB2 and the VM version ofSQL/DS, but not SQL/DS under VSE.andP;  Future versions of SQL/DS underVM will share DB2's locking protocol, referential integritysupport, and two-phase commit protocol.andP;  IBM is aggressivelymarketing SQL/DS to users in competing environments, emphasizingVSE despite the fact that it is not part of SAA.andP;  SQL/DS under VSEwill also be left out of IBM's plans to extend fully-distributedcapabilities across all SAA data bases, but user demand could spurthe company to add these capabilities.andM;</ABSTRACT></TEXT><DESCRIPT>Company:   International Business Machines Corp.
