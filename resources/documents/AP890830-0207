Richard Leakey, the director of wildlife, blamed the attacks onelephant poachers who have turned to banditry after being driven outof the animal reserves by Kenya's campaign to save its elephantpopulation.   He noted that the three fatal attacks before Adamson was slainAug. 20 took place in particularly remote areas and far from theusual tourist or safari trails.   His death and the killings of a Connecticut woman and a Frenchcouple in July raised fears for the health of Kenya's touristindustry, the country's No. 1 income earner.   But Leakey said he saw no reason for visitors to fear for theirsafety so long as they stay in regular tourist areas and on mainroads.   ``I have traveled widely in the last few weeks to assess thesituation for myself,'' he said after Adamson's death. ``Most of ourwildlife areas where the majority of tourists go are in my judgmentreasonably safe and there should be no need for tourists to feargoing there.''   The 83-year-old Adamson was shot to death near his camp at theremote Kora National Reserve in eastern Kenya while trying to helpan assistant and a guest who were being robbed by three gunmen.   Adamson, a retired game warden, had lived in Kenya since 1924and, with his wife, Joy, helped to popularize conservation throughtheir practice of releasing captive lions into the wild. Joy, whowas killed by a servant in 1980, detailed the unique practice in thebooks ``Born Free,'' ``Living Free,'' and ``Forever Free,'' whichsubsequently were made into movies.   In July, a French husband and wife were killed in the Meru gamepark, east of Mount Kenya, when they stumbled onto a group ofpoachers while driving down a seldom-used track.   Little more than two weeks later, on July 27, nine men attacked a19-member tour group organized by the Connecticut Audubon Society ona 40-mile stretch of dirt road between the southern national parksof Tsavo and Amboseli, killing Marie Esther Ferraro of Bethany, Conn.   Seven tourists have been wounded in separate attacks sinceSeptember a year ago. Tour operators say several hundred tourists,mostly Americans, have been frightened off by the violence.   Although the cancellations were quickly replaced by new bookings,the tour operators expressed fears Adamson's death would promptother tourists to cancel or defer plans to visit Kenya.   ``They call and want to know if it's safe to come to Kenya,''said the manager of one large safari company who spoke on conditionhe not be identified by name. ``We try to reassure them.''   Another safari group said it received 50 cancellations in thefour days after Adamson died.   Tourism is of prime concern to the government.   Last year, a record 660,000 tourists visited Kenya's game parksand Indian Ocean beach resorts and brought in an estimated $350million, outstripping income from the main export, coffee.   The tour operators expressed their anxieties recently at ameeting with Leakey, who sought to allay their fears.   He said roads, allowed to fall into disrepair in recent years,were being regraded and resurfaced to provide quicker and thereforesafer journeys. Plainclothes security officers have been posted inmost of the major tourist lodges in Kenya's game parks, he said.   In an interview later, Leakey claimed that because of theintensified anti-poaching operation, Kenya's tourist attractionsactually are safer now than six months ago. Most of the attacks, hesaid, had occurred outside the national parks.   Using more than 300 new weapons and 45 new vehicles, along withincreased air surveillance and renewed foot patrols, Kenya hasbrought poaching virtually to a halt since Leakey's appointment inApril.   The number of elephants killed has dropped from an average threea day to three since June, he said. In the last decade, theslaughter by poachers reduced Kenya's elephant population from65,000 to 17,000.   About three dozen poachers have been killed in the combinedeffort by the department of wildlife, police and paramilitary units,said Leakey. In the last few months no game rangers have died atpoachers' hands.   The revitalized effort has brought poachers under new pressures,Leakey said.   ``Previously people weren't being hurt because they didn'tfeature high on poachers' lists because elephants were so easy toget,'' he said.   Now, he added, ``they don't know where to go, they have nothing,they're short of cash and they've turned to robbery.''   Leakey said the government believed it was dealing with fewerthan 100 of the armed bandits, whom he identified as indigentSomalis called Shifta who have fled their war-torn, impoverishedcountry to exploit Kenya's elephants for their ivory tusks. Ivoryfetches $110 to $155 a pound on the world market, a record price.   ``Until very recently, there was very easy money to be made inthe national parks by killing elephants,'' Leakey said. ``Nobody wasafter them. There was no danger. It's very risky now to go intoTsavo if you're a poacher.''   Although Shifta have robbed and harrassed citizens in easternKenya since the early 1960s, David Stiles, an anthropologist who hasstudied Shiftas for nearly two decades, said many of thoseperpetrating the violence were deserters from Somalia's army whichis fighting a rebellion in northern Somalia.   Leakey said the Shifta were spread along a swath of arid, remoteterritory from Tsavo's periphery up to Meru and posed little threatto those who stayed on main roads and tourist byways.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Mon AMs, Sept. 4</NOTE></DOC>
