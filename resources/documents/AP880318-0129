On Thursday, Honduran warplanes fired bombs and rockets atNicaraguan army targets along the border. The Nicaraguan ForeignMinistry blamed Washington and delivered a formal protest to theUnited States.   There were conflicting reports about the raids.   Reagan administration officials said a Sandinista armyhelicopter in Nicaragua was destroyed, but Nicaragua denied that.   Honduras said its air force fired rockets only inside its ownterritory.   The United States deployed 3,200 U.S. troops after reportedincursions into Honduras by Nicaraguan soldiers pursuing Contrarebels. They included 700 paratroopers from the 82nd AirborneDivision of Fort Bragg, N.C., who dropped into Honduras today fromeight aircraft, said Pentagon spokeswoman Capt. Nancy LaLuntas.   A high-ranking Honduran military official said Honduran troopshad orders to expel the ``invading troops'' from Nicaragua and thatwarplanes were on standby.   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said anestimated 1,000 Sandinistas were reported today on the Honduranside of border at San Andres de Bocay. The Nicaraguan side is thesite of Sandinista military headquarters in northern Nicaragua.   The official said two infantry batallions of 1,600 to 2,000soldiers were moving into the region from a base at Juticalpa,about 90 miles to the west. He said warplanes were on call from theTamara base just north of the capital.   On Thursday, Honduran military spokesman Manuel Suarez said theHonduran air force launched air raids on the Honduran side of thefrontier at San Andres de Bocay.   Reporters flown to San Andres de Bocay saw two unidentified jetplanes roar in from Honduras just after noon and drop at least fivebombs near the border.   In a telephone interview, Suarez said Honduras rockets destroyeda Nicaraguan helicopter on a dirt landing strip inside Honduras.   Suarez did not identify the type of helicopter destroyed.   He said Nicaraguan forces launched a SAM-7 rocket at theHonduran jets but the missile missed its target and the Honduransfired retaliatory rockets.   In Washington, sources who spoke on condition of anonymity saidone Soviet-made helicopter was damaged on the ground in Nicaragua.The Soviet Union has been supplying the Sandinistas with militaryhardware.   In Managua, the Defense Ministry denied that any of its fleet ofmore than 40 military helicopters had been destroyed.   Reagan administration officials say Nicaraguan troops penetratedHonduran territory in pursuit of the Contras late Tuesday.   President Daniel Ortega of Nicaragua has neither confirmed nordenied that, but he said Nicaragua would continue its Contraoffensive in the border region, which began March 8.   When he heard of the Honduran attack, Ortega abruptly left ameeting with representatives of opposition parties in Managua.Foreign minister Miguel D'Escoto said Ortega had sent a diplomticnote to Secretary of State George P. Shultz to formally protest theraid.   Earlier, Ortega said his army was ``ready to combat andliquidate the famous forces of the 82nd Airborne Division.''   Lt. Col. Javier Carrion, deputy chief of the Sandinista army'sgeneral staff, said the Sandinistas had pushed 1,800 rebels backinto Honduras. The Sandinista forces totaled 4,500 troops, he said.   The Nicaraguan government had said 6,000 Contras have beenoperating within its borders nationwide. Carrion said the offensivecaught the rebels ``totally by surprise.''   Charles Barclay, press officer for the U.S. Embassy inTegucigalpa, said the deployment of American troops to Palmerolaair force base, about 50 miles northwest of Tegucigalpa, wascontinuing today.   Two battalions from the 82nd Airborne Division of Fort Bragg,N.C., and two battalions from the 7th Light Infantry Division ofFort Ord, Calif., were combined into a task force of roughly 3,000troops.   It was the the most dramatic show of U.S. force since theContras began fighting in Nicaragua and it came in response to arequest for help from President Jose Azcona Hoyo of Honduras.   In Washington, the Defense Department said nine helicoptergunships were flown in for the U.S. exercise.   Palmerola air base is about 125 miles west of the area whereReagan administration officials say the hostilities were takingplace.   Maj. Gen. Carl W. Stiner, commander of the 82nd Airborne, saidhe knew of no plan to have U.S. troops enter into fighting betweenSandinistas and Contras.</TEXT></DOC>
