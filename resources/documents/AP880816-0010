Many Americans already have seen their credit costs rise thisyear because of credit tightening on the part of the central bank.   As Fed policy-makers gathered to map monetary strategy behindclosed doors today, some economists were predicting that thecentral bank already has decided that even higher rates arenecessary to slow an economy being buffeted by rising inflationarythreats.   The meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee comes one weekafter the Fed, in a surprise move, boosted its discount rate byone-half percentage point to 6.5 percent, its highest level sinceJuly 1986.   An increase in the discount rate, the interest the Fed chargesto make loans to commercial banks, is the most dramatic signal thecentral bank can send of its intention to push interest rateshigher as a way of dampening demand and thus fighting inflationarypressures.   The timing of the discount rate increase was a surprise for manyeconomists who had expected the all-Republican Fed board, led byChairman Alan Greenspan, to shy away from such an overtcredit-tightening move in an election year.   While analysts said they don't expect another boost in thediscount rate until after the November election, they said the Fedvery likely will continue tightening credit by more subtle means.   Since late March, the Fed has been reducing the reserves bankshave available for making loans, driving up a variety of short-terminterest rates. The federal funds rate, which is the interest bankscharge to make overnight loans to each other, has now risen to 8percent and many economists predicted it would climb by anotherone-half percentage point in coming weeks.   Major banks followed the Fed's lead last week and boosted theirprime lending rate from 9.5 percent to 10 percent, a three-yearhigh. Analysts predicted that with further Fed pressure, the primerate will climb to 10.5 percent in the next two months.   ``I am looking for further tightening steps based on aperception by Fed policy-makers that the economy is growing toostrongly,'' said David Jones, an economist at Aubrey G. Lanston andamp;Co., a government securities dealer.   Because the prime rate is used to calculate a wide range ofconsumer loans, from adjustable mortgages to home equity loans, therate hikes will be felt quickly by consumers, analysts said.   They also predicted further increases in traditional fixed-ratemortgages. A national survey by the Federal Home Loan MortgageCorp. said fixed-rate mortgages jumped to 10.57 percent at the endof last week, up almost a percentage point from their February low.   Allen Sinai, chief economist at the Boston Co., said fixed-ratemortgages will hit 11 percent within a month with the only questionbeing how much higher they may go before the end of the year.   ``The economy has a tremendous head of steam, particularly inthe industrial sector,'' he said. ``History has shown us that onceour economy develops boom-like conditions, it takes tougherrestrictive policies to bring accelerating inflation undercontrol.''   Analysts pointed to a variety of recent statistics whichindicate inflation is a growing problem.   The government reported last week that wholesale prices shot upat an annual rate of 5.7 percent in July, compared with an increaseof 2.2 percent in 1987. Some economists predicted that consumerprices could be climbing at a 6 percent annual rate within sixmonths.   And on Monday, the government said industrial output climbed 0.8percent in July, the biggest increase since last October and anadvance which put further strains on many industries alreadyoperating at close to top capacity.   ``If the Fed doesn't continue to tighten in this environment, atleast in a moderate way, then it will have to tighten two or threetimes as much if it waits and inflation gets more out of hand,''Jones said.   But Jerry Jasinowski, chief economist of the NationalAssociation of Manufacturers, said he believes the Fed will waitawhile before it takes any further tightening moves.   ``I think they wanted to send a signal to the markets last weekthat inflation was their top priority,'' he said. ``Now that theyhave done that, they will lay back on their oars and see how theeconomy develops in the third quarter.''   Many economists are predicting that overall economic growth, asmeasured by the gross national product, will slow somewhat in thelast half of the year, compared with an annual rate of increase of3.3 percent in the first half of 1988.</TEXT></DOC>
