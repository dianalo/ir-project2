The fluorescence endoscope, made by Xillix Technologies ofVancouver, British Columbia, works on the principle thatunder a blue laser light, cancer cells fluoresce differentlyfrom healthy cells. The laser, which is lowered into thelungs, relays the images of fluorescent cells to a computerthat magnifies the intensity 30,000 times. The variations intissue fluorescence become apparent, indicating the area ofcancerous tissue, Xillix says.   &quot;With this method, you don't need to use any invasivedrugs, as are used in the conventional bronchoscopy today,&quot;says Xillix's medical director, Stephen Lam, who also teachesat the University of British Columbia.   Dr. Lam says the instrument can detect early cancer thatconventional procedures can't spot. Xillix claims theinstrument can spot lung tumors as small as one millimeter indiameter that escape detection with current methods. Becausesome treatments are site-specific, &quot;many patients come backsoon {with symptoms},&quot; Dr. Lam says. &quot;It isn't that they havedeveloped new cancer cells. The cells were already there butdidn't show up in the original bronchoscopy.&quot;                                                                                                          Oil-Free Polymers   Begin With Beach Sand                                                                                                          UNIVERSITY of Michigan researchers are converting sandinto the basic building blocks for new materials, which theysay could replace some petroleum-based products.   &quot;We could have a chemical industry where sand is animportant feedstock,&quot; says Richard Laine, a professor whosegroup published its work in a recent issue of the journalNature.   Most polymers today are created from raw materials derivedfrom petroleum. It's the carbon from crude oil that forms the&quot;backbone&quot; of a polymer, a long chain of molecules. Theresearchers say they created a similar backbone in which thechain is made up of silicon and oxygen derived from beachsand. When this basic chain was linked to carbon, the resultwas a number of new materials that had unique properties,Prof. Laine says.   He says one of the new polymers is capable of conductingelectricity. Potential applications include a heatablewindshield for cars. Another version of the white crystallinepowder turns out to be a good fire-retardant. He says thesesilicon polymers, if developed commercially in the future,&quot;are likely to be competitive with or superior to somecarbon-based materials currently used.&quot;   Silicon polymers aren't entirely new. They're used to makecarpets stain-resistant, leather waterproof and as breastimplants. But these compounds have four bonds in theirstructure. The Michigan compounds have five bonds, which givethem their conductive and fire-retardant properties, Prof.Laine says.   The researchers created the compounds in a simple,one-step process that involved dissolving plain sand inethylene glycol and a caustic solution. Previous attempts tomake similar compounds have proved less economical, involvingfour or five steps and a highly energy-intensive process,Prof. Laine says.                                                                                                          Tiny Organisms Munch   On Toxic Plastics Waste                                                                                                          MICROBES are seen as a solution to one of the most naggingenvironmental problems in plastics and other manufacturingindustries.   General Electric and Celgene recently demonstrated that anaturally occurring microbe can break down toxic methylenechloride waste, generated by GE's engineered plasticsoperations, into water, carbon dioxide and salt. GE nowrecovers the suspected carcinogen from its waste stream withan expensive and cumbersome distillation process.   The microbe offers a simpler and more effective way oftreating the pollutant, the two companies say. Using atechnology developed by Celgene, they found that when themicrobe was released into waste water containing the chemicaland other contaminants, it relied for energy solely onmethylene chloride, thus proving highly effective indegrading the chemical.   Thomas Lewis, Celgene vice president, says the organismreduced the presence of the chemical in waste water to levelsof parts per billion, &quot;well below&quot; the standards set by theEnvironmental Protection Agency. In contrast, distillationbrings the level down only to parts per million.   Methylene chloride is one of 17 high-priority toxicpollutants targeted by the EPA for sharp reductions by 1995.The chemical is also used in the photographic film andpharmaceutical industries.                                                                                                          Odds and Ends                                                                                                          ATLANTA'S AER Energy Resources says it has developed azinc-air battery that powers a laptop computer for 17 hours,more than eight times as long as current nickel-cadmiumbatteries. The new battery absorbs oxygen from air andcombines it with zinc to start a chemical reaction thatgenerates electricity. The company says the battery is alsoenvironmentally safe because it doesn't use the highly toxiccadmium. . . . Bio-Safe Specialty Products, Lakewood, Ohio,says it has developed a chemical process to recycleStyrofoam. The lightweight polystyrene is considered to beone of the toughest plastics to recycle because it's easilycontaminated and damaged when subjected to a chemicalprocess. The company has developed a solvent that completelydissolves the plastic. When the solvent evaporates, it leaves&quot;pure, undamaged Styrofoam,&quot; says Don Peters, president,who's developing a recycling machine with Finish Thompson,Erie, Pa.</TEXT></DOC>
