Kelly said at the annual meeting that TIE expects to return to profitability next year after posting losses since 1985.    Mr. Kelly predicted profitability at the annual meeting two years ago; a TIE spokesman acknowledged that that prediction hadn't materialized. TIE had a first-quarter net loss of $1.3 million on $62.2 million in sales.    Mr. Kelly said the Shelton, Conn.-based telephone equipment company plans to cut annual research-and-development spending this year $5 million, to $15 million. It also intends to continue cost-cutting and to buy whole or partial interests in its 200 dealers.    Phone makers, including foreign concerns, have been buying their distribution channels in the U.S. to ensure that distributors concentrate on selling their products instead of those of competitors.    The business has been wracked by cost-cutting and competitive pressures since the Bell System breakup four years ago. </TEXT></DOC>
