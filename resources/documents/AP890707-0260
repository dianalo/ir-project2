(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The United Mine Workers on Friday calleda three-day holiday for its members east of the Mississippi River,saying the contractually allowed memorial period would restore calmin the coal fields.   As many as 46,000 miners in 10 states have been involved inunauthorized strikes against coal operators who signed a no-strikecontract with the union. They walked out over The Pittston Co.'srefusal to sign a UMW contract.   UMW President Richard Trumka called the memorial period.   ``Although the union has requested that they return to work, theconditions which led to the protest _ excessive fines by federal andstate courts, the arrest of thousands of union members andsupporters by the Virginia State Police, the threat of indefinitejailings of union leaders and supporters and Pittston's refusal tonegotiate in good faith _ remain unchanged,'' Trumka said.   It is the first official sanction of the wildcat strikes thathave stricken the coal fields since June 12. The union had beenunder orders to lead the miners back to work.   ``The union is calling this memorial period in an attempt to calmthe volatile situation in the coal fields, in the hope that thisperiod will help put an end to a situation where the actions of onerenegade coal company and its allies have disrupted the entire coalindustry,'' Trumka said.   Morris Feibusch of the Bituminous Coal Operators Association,which negotiated the national contract with the union, said he hadno comment.   The last two weeks of the wildcat walkouts have coincided with anational vacation period for most miners covered by the UMWcontract, prompting speculation that its end would also mark the endof the unauthorized picketing.   ``Right now, I see absolutely no movement to go back to work,''said Howard Green, a UMW international executive board member fromCharleston-based District 17.   It wasn't clear what Trumka plans at the end of the memorialholiday, which will begin Monday. But UMW spokesman John Duray saidunion leaders would try to change the members' minds by the end ofthe break.   ``These people were out to protest something and they want to seea change in the situation,'' Duray said. ``We will be out in thenext three days to make sure they see a change in the situation.''   Union members will not have to picket other mines during themeorial period, Duray said. Keeping them off the streets should helprestore order, he said.   ``The purpose is to provide less of a sense of chaos out there,''he said. ``We won't have pickets going around. Some locals will havemeetings during the three days. Positive results will have a greaterchance.''   Chaos reigned at a Beckley meeting hall Friday as about 2,000striking coal miners protested the firing of 28 colleagues andprevented a hearing between union officials and the company thatdismissed the miners.   Toney's Branch Coal Co. Inc. fired the men on Thursday, makingthem the first dismissed since the wildcat strikes began. Dismissalforms circulated among the picketers said the men were fired forrefusing to cross picket lines at the Racine mine.   Company officals and represenatives from UMW District 17 refusedto cross the pickets and enter the Raleigh County Armory, where thesides were scheduled to meet to discuss the firings. The picketsdispersed after the meeting was postponed.   ``This should tell them that all it's going to do is incite theworkers,'' Green said from a telephone booth near the armory.   Both sides agreed to waive time restrictions on the hearing andsaid they would meet at a later date. The firings apparently stand,however.   About 37,000 workers in eight states were idled Friday as UMWmembers showed support for 1,900 coal miners striking The PittstonCo., which wants a separate contract with the union.   Pittston workers mined coal for more than 14 months without acontract before walking out April 5, refusing a company request thatminers work mandatory overtime and on Sundays and refusing proposedcuts in medical benefits for pensioners.   The BCOA said Friday that the wildcat strikes have kept $6million from entering the trust fund set up to pay medical benefitsto 118,000 pensioners who retired before 1976. BCOA President JosephBrennan also blamed $14 million in other losses since February 1988on the union's granting some companies lower contribution rates andsome coal companies' withholding contributions.   ``What we need is for the UMWA miners ... to return to work, forthe companies and the UMWA to honor existing contracturalcommitments and for the UMWA and the industry to work cooperativelyto find additional sources of revenue for the funds,'' Brennan said.   Pittston has not paid into the fund since January 1988, Feibuschsaid, despite a continuing obligation to it because it has formeremployees covered by it.</TEXT></DOC>
