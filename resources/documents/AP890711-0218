Marcus Schloss andamp; Co. was convicted Monday in U.S. District Courtin Manhattan of conspiracy and securities fraud, but the juryacquitted the firm of other charges and entirely cleared its chiefarbitrager.   The conviction was the first against a New York Stock Exchangemember firm in the government's three-year Wall Street insidertrading crackdown. None of the charges involved trading on the BigBoard.   Marcus Schloss was convicted of conspiracy in stock transactionsinvolving five companies in 1985 and 1986 and of securities fraudfor trading in the stock of American Brands Inc. in March 1986 usingillegally obtained inside information.   The firm faces a total fine of $1 million. Sentencing was set forSeptember, on a date to be set later.   But after a six-week trial and two weeks of deliberations, thejury acquitted the firm of five other counts and acquitted D. RonaldYagoda, its head of arbitrage trading, on a total of nine counts.   Marcus Schloss issued a statement saying it planned to ask thedistrict court to set aside the guilty verdict.   ``To convict the firm on two of the seven counts against it, atthe same time Mr. Yagoda is acquitted, is illogical in theextreme,'' the statement read.   Marcus Schloss and Yagoda were acquitted of securities fraud inconnection with purchases of stock in Allegheny International Inc.,Union Carbide Corp. and Avondale Mills, and of fraud in connectionwith tender offers for the stocks of Union Carbide and AvondaleMills.   Yagoda also was acquitted of fraud stemming from purchases ofAmerican Brands stock and of charges of perjury and obstruction ofjustice in connection with the Securities and Exchange Commission'sinvestigation of the case.   The conspiracy conviction against Marcus Schloss also includedcharges of illegal stock trades in American Can Corp.   Assistant U.S. Attorney Carl H. Loewenson Jr. declined to commenton the acquittals, stating that the jury ``convicted an importantstock trading firm of insider trading'' for the first time.   Yagoda's attorney, Stanley Arkin, said he was ``delighted'' bythe acquittal. ``I think the government never should have broughtthe case against him,'' he said. ``They had no credible evidence.''   The trial was an outgrowth of the ``Yuppie Five'' insider tradingcase that began in 1986. In that case, four young investmentprofessionals and a client of one of them confessed to stealingsecret information about takeovers and using it to profit in thestock market.   Marcus Schloss, Yagoda, another small brokerage and two otherindividuals were indicted last November on the insider-tradingrelated charges for alleged deals between July 1985 and March 1986.   The indictment accused the defendants of participating in aninsider trading ring with the Yuppie Five and an unidentified traderat the now-defunct firm of jailed inside trader Ivan Boesky. Thering included a former Marcus Schloss securities analyst, AndrewSolomon, who pleaded guilty in 1986 to insider trading andcooperated with the government.   The defendants allegedly used non-public information to tradeprofitabily in the stocks of the companies.   U.S. District Judge Charles S. Haight Jr. earlier this yearseparated the trials of the other defendants: Victor Teicher, hisfirm Victor Teicher andamp; Co., and Ross S. Frankel, a former head ofarbitrage research at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. They are scheduledfor trial in January 1990.   Yagoda also faces a separate civil trial in U.S. District Courtin Manhattan on charges involving the same four stocks he wasaccused of illegally trading. Marcus Schloss last year agreed to pay$410,700 to settle civil fraud charges with the SEC.</TEXT></DOC>
