 Whilemost vendors are taking great pains to offer open front ends, Aztek, with itsturnkey Spectrum One graphics system, seems to be heading in the oppositedirection.andP;  Spectrum One has much of the outward appearance of a dedicatedprepress system (light pen, table-top digitizer tablet, customized furniture,custom graphics monitor), but the Spectrum One is designed primarily formultimedia graphics presentations, with print output just one of the mediathat Aztek supports.andM;The components of the Aztek system are:andM;* Studio One: a color vector-based illustration and assembly workstation;andM;* spectrum One: a color raster- and vector-capable illustration and assemblyworkstation;andM;* Imagizer 3000: A 3000-line monochrome scanner;andM;* Imagizer 500: a CCD color scanner;andM;* Software for raster-to-vector conversion;andM;* Frame grabber;andM;* Aztek software for illustration, chart creation, and telecommunications;andM;* 300-dpi thermal-transfer color printer;andM;* 300-dpi monochrome laser printer;andM;* Slide-film recorder;andM;* A set of software modules for importing data and graphics from Autographix,Genigraphics, Harvard Graphics, Lotus Freelance, Versatec, and Zenographics.andM;Studio One and Spectrum One both reside on an Aztek-supplied '386-basedcomputer, the Aztek AT.andP;  Both systems run under DOS, with anapplication-specific windowing and multitasking extension.andP;  Both feature a19&quot; 1000-line graphics display with 4 MB of video RAM and 16.7 milliondisplayable colors.andP;  The Studio (vector) system can display 256 colors from apalette of 16.7 million, while the Spectrum (raster) system can show all 16.7million.andM;Aztek uses Bitstream fonts, at least for now.andP;  The systems can importPostScript, color TIFF, CGM, and PICT2, as well as Imapro, Howtek, and Lumenafiles.andP;  Output is to film recorders, video, color printers or separatedPostScript files.andM;The Aztek folks say they are aiming primarily at the package design, businessgraphics and corporate slidemaking markets.andP;  The company's efforts to developseparation software is its first step toward supporting print as one of itsapplications.andP;  The question, as with any vendor of a proprietary turnkeysystem, is, can the company keep up the furious development pace it has setfor itself?andM;The Color Group to market AnayaandM;Off the show floor, a new company called the Color Group was announced.andP;  Thetechnology is supplied by Anaya Systems of Madrid, Spain, a division of GrupoAnaya S.A., the world's largest Spanish-language publishing company.andP;  Thecompany was formed to market a color separation software technology that usesa patented (nonrosette) dot geometry under PostScript to create halftonescreens for four-color separations.andP;  The company is in the process oflicensing the technology to developers and manufacturers.andM;The Color Group, 6822 Delmonte Ave., Richmond, CA 94805; phone (415)237-5577.andM;Enabling shows Photo FinishandM;Enabling Technologies showed off Photo Finish, a combination ofphoto-retouching and photorealistic 3-D rendering.andP;  The software, which willrun on either Macinosh or DOS machines, permits effects that are difficult toachieve via separate packages.andP;  3-D objects are created in a module calledZing.andP;  Objects can be created from a wide variety of geometric primatives,and 3-D clip art can be imported from Enabling Technologies' extensivecollection.andP;  Objects can be rotated and viewed from various angles.andP;  Theposition of light sources can also be adjusted.andM;Using Photo Lab, a second module, various effects such as texture mappingonto a surface, shadows and reflections can be added, and multiple images canbe combined.andM;The Photo Finish package will be available later this fall.andP;  It will sell for$1,995.andM;Imapro: separations from a PelBox 3000andM;Imapro was showing the capabilities of its Imapro Color Production Solutionat the ECRM booth, with output from a PelBox 3000 recorder.andP;  Imapro is thefirst company driving the PelBox 3000 in full color.andP;  Using a newly acquiredPostScript interpreter from CAI, Imapro is able to read files from QuarkXpress and PageMaker, and EPS files as well.andP;  However, the separations arecreated with Imapro's proprietary halftoning technique, not the PostScriptinterpreter.andP;  Imapro does use PostScript to create a fifth black film fortype and line art.andP;  The firm claims a rasterizing speed of five minutes perseparation and was running live demos in the booth.andM;The system for the workstation consists of a '386 PC, a VGA monitor, 16megabytes of RAM, 600 megabytes of hard disk, 2-gigabyte Exabyte VHS tapestorage drive, and a proprietary interface to the PelBox 3000.andP;  The CAI RIPis in software, along with the color manipulation and separation softwareproprietary to Imapro.andM;In another development, Pre-Press Technologies was showing off Imapro'sscanner as in input tool for its system and displaying results.andP;  Imapro hasmodified the Sharp flatbed scanner to detect 12 bits of color per pixel,which are software-mapped to eight bits.andP;  Imapro has also rebuilt the Sharplight source to allow for transparency scanning.andP;  The machine can be used forscanning 4&quot; X 5&quot; transparencies at 600 dpi (as opposed to 300 dpi normally),making it more suitable for catalog and brochure use, since much of thephotography in those markets is in the &quot;4 X 5&quot; format.andM;The price of Imapro's output workstation with RIP software and PelBox 3000 is$84,000.andM;ZSoft enhances PC Paintbrush IVandM;ZSoft was showing its newly released PC Paintbrush IV Plus, but surrounded byall the dazzling Mac color paint products, the latest color version of this&quot;PC standard&quot; looks slightly forlorn.andP;  Clearly, dealing with the PC's displayis one major reason, but it's curious that ZSoft would choose to stick withRGB and hue-saturation-brightness color models and leave CMYK out of its newrelease.andP;  The color samples on its literature are photos taken directly fromthe PC screen, not separated through the PC.andP;  PC Paintbrush IV Plus does addmany enhancements over its forebears, though: EMS support so it can nowhandle 8 bits of gray or color information per pixel over large images;blending and smudging tools (although the area you select to act on isdeselected after each use of the tool, so making repeated adjustments toirregularly shaped areas is a practical impossibility); super-VGA support:color palettes you can save for later use; and the ability to combinegray-scale and color elements in a single image.andM;ZSoft was also showing version 1.2 of Type Foundry, its digital font outlinecreation program.andP;  Now that Altsys has announced plans to port Fontographerfrom the Mac to the PC, copies of Type Foundry are apt to become collectors'items--if PC Fontographer works anything like its Mac predecessor, TypeFoundry's market will dry up overnight.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
