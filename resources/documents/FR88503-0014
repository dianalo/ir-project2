In some provisions, the language ofthe revised model rules remained the same as that in the original modelrules. However, the Department had not adopted the original model ruleslanguage when it promulgated its original rules. The Department now proposesto use the language of the revised model rules in most instances becauseit conveys more clearly the purpose of, and better implements, the Act.A synopsis of significant proposed changes follows. Unless otherwise indicated,all proposed amendments conform to the language of the revised model rules.Section 1.180, ``Definitions,'' would be amended to add definitions of``Adjudicative Officer,'' ``Agency,'' ``Days,'' and ``Department.'' Section 1.181, ``Purpose of these rules,'' would be amended to delete thewords ``in the proceeding'' where that phrase modifies the Department position.Section 1.182, ``When the Act applies,'' would be amended to reflect thenew dates of application. It is proposed to include a provision makingproceedings subject to Chapter 38 of title 31, United States Code, relatingto administrative remedies for false claims and statements, effective October21, 1986, the date of enactment of Pub. L. No. 99-509. Section 1.183, ``Proceedings covered,'' paragraph (a), would be amendedby adding proceedings under the Contract Disputes Act of 1978 (41 U.S.C.605) as adversary adjudications covered by the Act. Language exceptingsuch proceedings would be deleted. It would also be amended to includethe Animal Quarantine Act and the Plant Quarantine Act to the list of proceedingscovered as adversary adjudications. The two acts were inadvertently omittedwhen the regulations were originally published. In addition, pursuant toPub. L. No. 99-509, hearings conducted pursuant to Chapter 38 of title31, United States Code would be added as an adversary adjudication coveredby the Act. A new paragraph (b) is proposed to be added regarding the failureof the Department to list a particular type of adjudication. The proposedprovision would allow a party to file an application, where the proceedingis not listed in the section, and thereby raising the issue of whetherthe proceeding is covered. Paragraph (b) appeared in the original modelrules, but was omitted from the original Department rules. Former paragraph(b) would be redesignated paragraph (c). Section 1.184, ``Eligibility of applicants,'' would be amended to reflectthe new net worth figures for individuals, $2 million, and corporations,$7 million, and to add ``unit of local government'' as a potential eligibleapplicant. Section 1.185, ``Standards for awards,'' would be amended to clarify themeaning of the ``position of the agency.'' In accordance with the modelrules, language permitting avoidance of an award by showing reasonablenesshas been proposed for deletion. Section 1.186, ``Allowable fees and expenses,'' would be amended to conformto the revised model rules to provide more detail on the basis of awards.A new andSection; 1.187, ``Rulemaking on maximum rates for attorney fees,''is proposed to be added. The new section would provide that, if warrantedby increased cost of living or special circumstances, the Department mayadopt regulations providing that attorney fees may be awarded at a ratehigher than $75 per hour. Any such rulemaking would be pursuant to informalrulemaking procedures under the Administrative Procedure Act. It also providesthat any person may petition for such rulemaking in accordance with theregulations at 7 CFR 1.28. This provision appeared in the original modelrules and is proposed to be added to conform to the revised model rules.Current andSection; 1.187, ``Delegations of authority,'' is proposed to beredesignated as andSection; 1.189. It is proposed to amend the section tonote specifically that the Board of Contract Appeals is authorized by statuteto take final action in proceedings covered by andSection; 1.183(a)(1)(ii).A new andSection; 1.188, ``Award against other agencies'', is proposed tobe added. The new provision would allow a prevailing party to receive anaward or portion of the award where it prevails over another agency ofthe United States participating in a proceeding before the Department.This provision appeared in the original model rules and is proposed tobe added to conform to the revised model rules. Current andSection; 1.188, ``Contents of application,'' would be redesignatedandSection; 1.190, and would be amended to delete the words ``in the proceeding''where that phrase modifies the Department position. Paragraph (b) is proposedto be amended to substitute the new net worth figures of $2 million forindividuals, and $7 million for corporations. Current andSection; 1.189, ``Net worth exhibit,'' would be redesignated asandSection; 1.191, and paragraph (b), regarding an applicant's objectionto disclosures of the net worth exhibit, would be amended. Provisions requiringan applicant to demonstrate why public disclosure would adversely affectthe applicant and why disclosure is not in the public interest have beenproposed for deletion. The Department does not believe it is necessaryto put an additional burden on the applicant over and above that providedfor under the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552).Current andSection; 1.190, ``Documentation of fees and expenses,'' is proposedfor redesignation as andSection; 1.192, and as in the original rules, therequirements for documentation are set out in greater detail than in therevised model rules. We believe this detail will expedite disposition ofapplications. Paragraph (d) would be amended to clarify that the adjudicativeofficer may require provision of information substantiating any fees, aswell as expenses. A further amendment would make the procedures of andSection;1.199 applicable to the provision of this information.Current andSection; 1.191, ``Time for filing application,'' is proposed forredesignation as andSection; 1.193. Paragraph (a) would be amended to allowfiling of an application whenever an applicant has prevailed in the proceedingor in a significant and discrete substantive portion of the proceeding.This broadening of filing times conforms to both the original and revisedmodel rules. Paragraph (c) would be redesignated paragraph (b) and amendedto simplify the meaning of ``final disposition.'' Paragraph (b) would beredesignated paragraph (c) and amended to specify that no decision on afee application can be made where the United States has appealed the underlyingmerits to a court. Current andSection; 1.192, ``Filing and service of documents,'' is proposedto be redesignated as andSection; 1.194. Current andSection; 1.193, ``Answer to application,'' would be redesignatedas andSection; 1.195 and amended to provide that failure of agency counselto file an answer, in the absence of an extension of time for filing ora statement of intent to negotiate, may be treated as consent to the awardrequested. A further amendment would require a statement of intent to negotiateto be filed jointly by the applicant and agency counsel. These amendmentswould conform the Department rules to the revised model rules. Current andSection;andSection; 1.194 through 1.196 would be redesignated asandSection;andSection; 1.196 through 1.198, respectively. Current andSection; 1.197, ``Further proceedings,'' would be redesignatedas andSection; 1.199 and amended to clarify the circumstances under which``pertinent discovery or an evidentiary hearing'' is appropriate. Amendmentsto the Act provide that substantial justification determinations can bemade only on the basis of the administrative record made in the adversaryadjudication for which the fees are sought. Current andSection; 1.198, ``Decision,'' would be redesignated as andSection;1.200 and amended to include a provision that would require the adjudicativeofficer to allocate fee awards among the agencies involved where an awardis sought against more than one agency. Another amendment would clarifythe requirement that the adjudicative officer must make ``findings on''whether the Department position was substantially justified, whether therewas undue protraction of the proceedings by the applicant, or whether specialcircumstances make an award unjust. This proposed amendment conforms toprovisions in the original and revised model rules which were not includedin the original Department rules. Current andSection;andSection; 1.199 through 1.201, would be redesignated asandSection;andSection; 1.201 through 1.203, respectively. References to ``Judge'' in andSection;andSection; 1.184, 1.186, 1.191, 1.192,1.195, 1.197, 1.199, and 1.200, would be replaced by references to ``adjudicativeofficer.'' This proposed change was necessitated in part by the amendmentof the Act to provide specifically for proceedings under the Contract DisputesAct of 1978. The definition of ``judge'' in 7 CFR 1.132, incorporated byreference by andSection; 1.180(a), was too restrictive. This proposed rule has been reviewed under Secretary's Memorandum 1512-1and Executive Order No. 12291 and has been determined not to be a ``majorrule'' since it will not have an annual effect on the economy of $100 millionor more. In addition, it has been determined that these proposed rules will nothave a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 7 CFR Part 1 </ITAG>Administrative practice and procedures. <ITAG tagnum="52">PART 1_[AMENDED] </ITAG>Accordingly, it is proposed to revise 7 CFR, Subtitle A, Part 1, SubpartJ to read as follows: <ITAG tagnum="76">Subpart J_Procedures Relating to Awards Under the Equal Access toJustice Act in Proceedings Before the Department </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="74">General Provisions </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="70">Sec. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1.180 Definitions. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1.181 Purpose of these rules. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1.182 When the Act applies. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1.183 Proceedings covered. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1.184 Eligibility of applicants. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1.185 Standards for awards. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1.186 Allowable fees and expenses. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1.187 Rulemaking on maximum rates for attorney fees. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1.188 Awards against other agencies. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1.189 Delegations of authority. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="74">Information Required From Applicants </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1.190 Contents of application. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1.191 Net worth exhibit. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1.192 Documentation of fees and expenses. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1.193 Time for filing application. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="74">Procedures for Considering Applications </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1.194 Filing and service of documents. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1.195 Answer to application. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1.196 Reply. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1.197 Comments by other parties. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1.198 Settlement. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1.199 Further proceedings. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1.200 Decision. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1.201 Department review. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1.202 Judicial review.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1.203 Payment of award.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority: </T4>5 U.S.C. 504(c)(1). </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="56">Subpart J_Procedures Relating to Awards Under the Equal Access toJustice Act in Proceedings Before the Department </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">General Provisions </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 1.180</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Definitions. </ITAG>(a) The definitions contained in Subpart H_Rules of Practice GoverningFormal Adjudicatory Proceedings (andSection; 1.132 of this part) are incorporatedinto and made applicable to this subpart.
