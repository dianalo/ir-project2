Or will it beSteve Young, backup No. 1, who has been out four weeks after undergoingarthroscopic knee surgery?  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Sports  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  BONO, NOT YOUNG, WILL START  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  See also related story on P. 1D of this section  </MEMO><TEXT>     Asked if Bono will start, Seifert said, &quot;At this time, he's our starter,yes.&quot; Young, Seifert said, will suit up, back up, but won't start againstSeattle unless something happens to Bono.;   And after that? Apparently thequestion has been tabled for another week.;   Since first subbing for Youngagainst the Saints on Nov. 10 in New Orleans, Bono has led the 49ers to threeconsecutive victories, including a 38-24 triumph over the Saints atCandlestick Park on Sunday. Yet Young vows to be ready in time for theSeahawks game. That would seem to have made the 49ers' quarterback decision atough one.;   But give Seifert this out: Why subject Young's untested leftknee to the artificial turf in Seattle?;   Seifert would not say the startingjob is Bono's to lose, only that Bono will remain the starter until Young hasproved himself 100 percent healthy.;   &quot;As far as Steve Young is concerned,the guy that would go back in and be the starter, he would have to basicallybe capable of doing what he was capable of doing when he was the starter,&quot;said Seifert, never known to be a stickler for clarity.;   Young, who suitedup for the New Orleans game, said he was ready to come in against the Saintsif necessary.;   &quot;It would have been great, because I could have tested myknee to see how it feels,&quot; he said.;   There's this argument that it would beunwise to switch quarterbacks when Bono is on such a streak.;   &quot;Well, I wouldwant the team to do well, and obviously I have a huge amount of confidence inmyself to do the job,&quot; Young said. &quot;There's all kinds of speculation aboutwhat's best. But if you're going to leave it up to me, then, you know . . . &quot;;  How would he counter such an argument? &quot;I would counter that I haveconfidence that I can get the job done.&quot;;   Certainly there's a lot to be saidfor Bono, who has put together the 49ers' only three-game winning streak thisseason. But Young wasn't exactly a loser, Seifert said.;   &quot;I'd say we've wonwith both Steves. We're inclined to do what we best think at that particulartime, and that time is not here right now,&quot; he said.;   The decision whetherto start Bono or Young on Dec. 14 against the Kansas City Chiefs won'tnecessarily have to be made right away, as in next Monday, Seifert said.;  &quot;There would be a lot of factors involved in it,&quot; he said. &quot;I think themedical reasons will be part of it; movement reasons will be part.&quot;  </TEXT><BYLINE>  NANCY GAY, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   911203  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Tuesday  </DAY><MONTH>  December  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1D  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  520  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Tuesday, December 3, 199100338072,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
