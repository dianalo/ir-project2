(chart)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Anaya Systems and El Sol: Innovation in a Spanish NewspaperandM;THE IMPACT OF desktop publishing tools on the newspaper market continues toescalate.andP;  Among the signs pointing in this direction were the most recentIFRA and ANPA trade shows, at which Quark Xpress provided perhaps thedominant theme.andP;  Besides that, the number of interesting applications usingdesktop tools have become much more than isolated dots on a map; they aremore like a stampede.andP;  They have tended to focus on the use of Macintoshes innewspaper production, particularly where color is involved.andM;Some of the notable examples have been covered in the pages of this Report.andO;The new National sports daily in the United States (see Vol.andP;  19, No.andP;  11)and the weekly European (see Vol.andP;  19, No.andP;  18) published out of Londonpaginate with Quark Xpress through the use of the Scitex Visionary system,with output to full Scitex imaging systems with Scitex Raystar imagers.andP;  Inboth of these cases, an established newspaper system vendor worked withScitex to put together the editorial systems.andP;  At the National it wasCybergraphic and at the European it was QED.andM;We also recently covered the Canadian newspaper LeDroit (see Vol.andP;  19, No.andO;20), where again Quark in its standard Xpress form is used for pagination,taking input this time from a Software Consulting Services system.andP;  Output inPostScript format is to Linotronic 300 imagesetters.andP;  The system has beenintegrated by Systemhouse of Ottawa,  veteran integration company.andM;The latest newspaper to attract our eye also employs Macintoshes and producesa full-color newspaper: the new Spanish national daily newspaper, El Sol,published by Grupo Anaya.andP;  One of the largest publishers in Spain, Anaya is a$200-million-a-year company working mainly in book publishing, with 60% ofits revenues coming from educational books.andP;  It is also a major magazinepublisher, producing not only its own titles but also MacUser, PC Week and PCMagazine in Spain.andM;Anaya, the company.andP;  Anaya is probably not a new name to Seybold readers.andP;  Wefirst encountered Anaya in 1989 on a visit to Madrid to speak at a publishingconference.andP;  At that time, it was producing some of the best color PostScriptwe had seen.andP;  It also had developed its own color screening extensions toPostScript, for which it was applying for a patent.andP;  (We will cover this inmore detail later.)andM;Anaya was using Quark Xpress and Ventura Publisher to produce a range ofpublications, many of which made use of both generated and scanned colorimages.andP;  It also was working in the creation of multimedia systems.andM;Anaya's Randamp;D department, called Anaya Systems, appeared in 1989 at ANPA (inthe Apple booth) and at IFRA, where it showed its Macintosh wire photosystem.andP;  At this year's ANPA show, it appeared on the Nikon stand with animpressive new wire picture system.andP;  The Anaya Picture Desk has been licensedto ND Comtec, which incorporates it into its systems.andP;  In the United States,it is being sold though the Color Group, headed by Steve Schaffran.andO;Discussions are also taking place with Nikon and Agence France-Presse forinternational distribution rights to the product.andM;Anaya Systems was the integrator for designing and implementing El Sol'spublishing system.andM;Where El Sol differs from the systems we have looked at before is that ituses no established editorial system, such as those of Cybergraphic, QED andSoftware Consulting Services.andP;  Instead, production from reporters' input tofully paginated output is accomplished through the use of AppleShare, QuarkXpress and MacWrite II, linked with Wire Manager from Baseview.andP;  Overallsystem operation is based on a well-organized setup of an AppleShare networkusing multiple file servers, with a specific server allocated to each sectionof the newspaper, and a series of work folders.andP;  Performance is optimizedthrough the use of both thin Ethernet and LocalTalk cabling, with networkbridges and multiport repeaters connecting to a dual-Ethernet networkbackbone that links all floors of the newspaper.andM;Unlike most of the other systems we have discussed previously, El Sol isn'tusing Quark Xtensions.andP;  Full pages for most of the newspaper are made upusing the standard Xpress package, with color images coming in through eitherAdobe PhotoShop or Adobe Illustrator.andP;  Output of all scanned color imagesuses Anaya's color screening algorithm, which provides an acceptable imagewithout moire.andM;Planning the newspaperandM;El Sol is published by Compania Europea de Communicaciones e Informacion(CECISA), a company wholly owned by Grupo Anaya and its president, GermanSanchez ruipere.andP;  Initially Mondatori (the largest Italian publisher) andBerlusconi (the Italian TV magnate) were also shareholders, but they withdrewin a dispute related to a Spanish TV channel.andP;  Grupo Anaya left the TVchannel, while the others left El Sol.andM;El Sol was planned to be a color daily and Sunday newspaper, designed to filla part of the market not covered by the major Spanish newspaper, El Pais.andO;The circulation of El Sol in July 1990 was stated to be approximately 220,000on Sunday and 120,000 daily, compared with El Pais's circulation of about800,000 Sunday and 300,000 daily.andM;Technical planning started in December 1989, about five months before thenewspaper went live on May 22, 1990.andP;  Planning was handled largely by the artdirector, who joined in November 1989 from an Atex background, and AnayaSystems staff.andP;  The plan was to use standard desktop publishing tools, but toprovide the required copyflow management that would be available on adedicated editorial system.andM;A few external advisors assisted, including Roger Black and Danilo Ruiz, whodesigned the paper from a graphics standpoint and also designed the weeklysupplements and the magazine.andP;  They also helped to evangelize the artdirectors to master desktop publishing tools.andP;  Gary Cosimini of the New YorkTimes also provided advice from his experience and information on forthcomingbeta releases of software.andP;  Steve Schaffran of the Color Group, who was thedirect link to companies in the U.S., assisted in getting products intoSpain, where anything for the Macintosh is still difficult to get.andM;ConfigurationandM;In overall structure, El Sol has one of the most sophisticated configurationswe have seen using standard, shrink-wrapped tools.andP;  It has been turned toprovide the necessary performance and to eliminate potential bottlenecks indata transfer.andM;The El Sol offices are spread over five (soon to be six) floors of itsbuilding.andP;  A dual thick Ethernet backbone runs directly between floors.andP;  Eachfloor has a separate, air-conditioned room for file servers where theEthernet links the servers and networks for the operations of that floor (seediagram).andM;On each floor in the server room, a multiport repeater allows up to eightseparate, thin Ethernet legs to join the Ethernet backbone via a transceiveras an extension of the Ethernet.andP;  Most of these thin Ethernet links alsoconnect via Shiva FastPaths to LocalTalk cabling, where text handling iscarried out on reporter workstations.andP;  In one case--where there is heavytraffic with images--the multiport repeater is bridged to the Ethernetbackbone to provide a separate network to avoid overloading the main network.andO;It is possible, however, to access or send data between networks via thebridge.andP;  The multiport repeaters and bridges are supplied by Cabletron.andM;There currently are 15 separate file servers on the overall network.andP;  Withcorrect access privileges, a user can call up 26 separate volumes visible onthe networks.andP;  El Sol is adding a 48-gigabyte optical disc jukebox using MARSretrieval software from Micro Dynamics, which is going to be linked to thenetwork.andM;About 130 Macs are configured on the network, mostly Mac IIx or IIcx units.andO;There are no Mac IIfx computers because Quark's copy-protection scheme isn'tcompatible with the IIfx in Spain.andP;  (We'll say more later about Quark's copyprotection, which is one of Anaya's main problems.)andP;  On the fifth floor isthe sole IBM PS/2 linked to the network, which serves as the link into theIBM AS/400 advertising and business system.andM;OperationandM;Two areas we were particularly interested in seeing were the editorialoperation with no traditional editorial system and the use of Quark Xpress assoftware for reporters.andP;  (As most readers are aware, we haven't found Xpressvery impressive as a writing tool.)andP;  We took a good look at how the El Solsituation stacks up.andM;Following a staff meeting at about 10:30 AM, at which the major news isdiscussed on a section-by-section basis, the relevant chief editors (sectionheads) and art directors design their pages as a series of templatesincluding areas for text with standard headings and areas for graphics.andP;  Theymay use existing templates that are stored in the library for the section, orthey can create new ones, which, in turn, would be saved in the library.andM;Writing to fit templates.andP;  After one of these templates, or master pages, hasbeen completed for a particular page, it is printed a few times on an AppleLaserWriter.andP;  A printed copy of the template is then give to each of thereporters who is writing a story for that page.andP;  The template indicates thearea for that reporter to write into.andM;In general, the staff members working on the same page work in the samephysical area as the section head--often on the same desk--so mostcommunication among them is through normal conversation.andP;  The reporter towhom a story is assigned opens a copy of the template, stores it on his disk,writes the copy to fit the space assigned, and then files the story both inhis folder and in the page folder on the file server.andP;  In many cases,particularly if the article is long or if it is being written before the pageis designed, the reporter writes the story using MacWrite II and then importsit into Xpress.andM;Making up pages.andP;  Final pages are made up by the section head and artdirector.andP;  They open each version of the page where completed stories havebeen filed, cut each story from this version and paste it onto the outputpage.andP;  A simple naming convention and folder structure organizes the flow ofcopy.andP;  Images at screen resolution are sent from the image processing sectionto the relevant page folders, where the art director pastes them onto thepage, cropping and scaling them if required.andP;  In most cases, cropping andscaling are done during the image processing step at an early stage so imagesare ready for the page at this late stage.andP;  (See details of graphics handlinglater.)andM;When the page is completed, it is printed with text and low-resolution imageson a Tegra Varityper VT600W printer (A3 size) and routed to a centraleditorial desk for a final OK.andP;  The page is then sent to the filmsettingserver, where the production department operators match it with the requisitehigh-resolution images and output it to a Lintronic 300.andM;In perspective: &quot;anarchy&quot; model?andP;  This method of page planning and assemblyworks, although it strikes us as being too laborious, particularly in someareas that could be improved through the use of Quark Xtensions.andP;  We wouldlike to see Xtnsions for automatically creating the reporters' copies oftemplates and for building final pages without the need to cut and paste eachstory.andP;  For example, a number of Xtensions we saw recently at ANPA shouldhelp in this area, particularly Managing Editor Software's Page Director.andO;Alternatively, the P.Ink approach (shown at Drupa and at ANPA) seems idealfor the El Sol method of working.andP;  At the time El Sol was being planned andimplemented, none of these existed, so it had to rely on some manualoperations.andM;The system structure doesn't provide centralized control.andP;  In fact, theconcept is to go to the opposite extreme, to what is sometimes called the&quot;anarchist commune&quot; model in the best Spanish tradition.andP;  The newspaper isorganized into small working groups, each responsible for a section of thenewspaper, with no more than six to ten pages to handle.andP;  Each group has itsown file server, through which all intergroup communication and links to theoutside world take place.andP;  The groups share common services--image scanning,wire service news and pictures, page setting, archival services,communications, etc.--via the central Ethernet backbone.andP;  Each section/groupincludes the section's chief editor, an art and layout editor, a closingeditor, and anywhere from two to 12 reporters.andP;  Based on a structure of smallsections and close working positions, there doesn't appear to be any problemin handling page progress and work flow.andM;Wire serviceandM;El Sol makes extensive use of wire services for both text and images.andP;  Thehandling of wire photos is covered later under image handling.andP;  For text,seven separate news wire services are received in three languages.andP;  Incomingwires go through a concentrator supplied by the Spanish company Prayelsr,which buffers the news, maps different character sets into the Macintoshcharacter set, translates different headers into a single format (ANPA 1312),maps different wire categories (sports, national, local, etc.) andprioritizes them into those used in the newspaper.andP;  After this, the differentstreams are concentrated into a single RS232C port of a Macintosh at 9,600baud.andM;This Macintosh uses a customized version of the Baseview Wire Manager systemthat we recently saw at ANPA (see Vol.andP;  19, No.andP;  21, p. 4).andP;  It routes thenews into a wire server, creating a range of indexes to facilitate selectiveaccess from the network.andP;  Fourteen hours of wire news ar kept online, withautomatic purging applied every hour.andP;  Due to server performance degradation,a maximum of 40 workstations have access to the wire server.andM;The networkandM;One of the first users of AppleShare Phase 2, El Sol has utilized thisenhanced version since its initial planning.andP;  Phase 2 retains the benefits ofthe original AppleShare and adds dynamic node addressing and distributed nameservice concepts.andP;  These allow the addition of users to the network withouthaving to bring it down.andP;  They also allow unskilled users to navigate throughthe network with a degree of familiarity because resources are known byself-explanatory names.andM;Anaya Systems states that the average user is totally unaware of AppleSharebecause it is so transparent.andP;  Within Phase 2, there are virtually unlimitedaddressing capabilities.andP;  Locigal addresses can be defined totallyindependent of the physical network configuration, allowing physical andlogical addressing to be based on workflow and user convenience, withoutconcern for network infrastructure restrictions.andM;As we looked at AppleShare Phase 2, we were reminded of the problems Talbotfaced in building a large AppleTalk network for its NewsWrite system, whichwe reviewed earlier this year.andP;  Talbot had found it necessary to write majoradditions to the system for Macintoshes on the Ethernet backbone to handlemuch of the addressing and copy movement that is now performed by Phase 2.andM;We can surmise that El Sol's system shows the benefits of having SteveSchaffran and Gary Cosimini in the U.S.andP;  working on the project, getting holdof prerelease software.andP;  In most cases, Apple doesn't let such softwareoutside the U.S., despite the fact that much of the best software developmentin multiuser publishing applications comes from Europe (from Talbot, QED,P.Ink, Anaya, Tele-Ekonomi, DPS Typecraft and others).andM;Another benefit of Phase 2 is the support of industry standards, such as IEEE802.2 protocols, which has allowed Anaya to integrate seamlessly--and withouta glitch--Apple equipment with other third-party network devices, such asmultiport repeaters and bridges.andP;  Anaya doesn't make use of all the improvedinternet routing capabilities of Phase 2, but it has found that a techniquecalled &quot;split horizon&quot; has significantly reduced the background traffic thatwould otherwise have been present with the large number of routers installedon the backbone to move information packets between servers.andM;Background traffic that is monitoried by network analyzers is said to beinsignificant.andP;  AppleShare Phase 2 still has limitations for newspapers inthat there is no duplicate writing of data, which is expected to be includedwith System 7 utilities.andP;  Backup of data is covered by other means, which wewill discuss later.andM;The network, which runs continuously--24 hours a day, 7 days a week--has beenvery reliable.andP;  At the time of our visit, it had been operational in liveproduction for more than two months without a single system crash.andM;Image handlingandM;As stated earlier, the system at El Sol handles full pagination of text andgraphics, both color and monochrome.andP;  Not all graphics currently are handleddigitally, however.andP;  Customer-supplied, prescreened advertising is handledconventionally through an ECRM Autokon camera and pasted onto the page.andP;  Ifrequired, these ads could be scanned into the system, since one of the twoAutokons has an ECRM SCSI interface box to connect it to one of the Macintoshgraphics systems.andM;While the output pages are being faxed to the printing plant via a CrosfieldPageFax system, there seems little benefit to scanning such images.andP;  ButCrosfield is committed to supplying a PostScript RIP and interface to itsPageFax communications system to bypass the facsimile scanning stage.andP;  Thiswill allow direct conversion of PostScript to run-length-encoded scannedimage format for direct output on the remote PageFax recorder.andP;  After thishas been supplied, all images will be scanned.andM;The Anaya Picture Desk.andP;  Graphics can come into the system from threeseparate routes.andP;  The first is wire service input from the Anaya PictureDesk.andP;  Four picture wires--EFE (Spain), Reuters, Associated Press andEPA/France press--are received and stored on the wire server.andM;During the course of the 24-hour day, about 300 pictures are received, whichtakes about 300 MB.andP;  The system has sufficient storage for 36 hours of suchpictures, but there are plans to implement a full JPEG compression schemesoon to increase the storage capability.andP;  El Sol planned to use the PictureDesk software to browse the received pictures and to route them to differentsections, where they could be selected directly on the screen by artdirectors.andP;  Because the browsing and routing software of the Picture Desk wasnot fully operational when the system was being planned, an alternativesolution was required, and this is the one that is successfully in use today.andM;A Mac installed on the network constantly monitors incoming wire photos.andO;When a new picture arrives, a 300-dpi copy is produced on an AppleLaserWriter, enhanced somewhat to product better print quality, particularlyof the caption.andP;  While the image is being printed, it is copied onto the fileserver and to a removable optical disc for backup.andP;  The complete cycle ofretrieving the picture, processing it, printing it, saving it to the fileserver and backing it up takes less than two minutes.andP;  At peak times, a newpicture is received every 10 minutes on each of the four lines, so a singleLaserWriter suffices.andP;  Wire pictures are given a name that identifies thesource, date and time of arrival.andM;Picture editors periodically collect the paper copies of the wire images, asthey did with conventional wire service picture printers.andP;  They findplain-paper copies useful for selection and planning.andP;  These copies are takento editorial meetings or are routed to different sections.andM;When an image is selected for possible inclusion on a given page, the papercopy is brought to the image processing section (see below) with a writtenindication of the name to be given to the corresponding file, an estimate ofthe reproduction size, a rough crop, the page number where it will be placed,and the name of the file server where a low-resolution version of the imagemust be sent.andP;  The naming procedure is vital because the slightest differencein naming of the high-resolution and low-resolution versions will preventXpress from locating the high-resolution image to swap it for thelow-resolution version on the page.andM;The image processing section.andP;  The second source of images, the &quot;imageprocessing&quot; section, handles all wire service and scanned images to beoutput, both monochrome and color.andP;  This section has six Macintosh IIxworkstations, which are likely to be upgraded to IIfx units.andP;  Four of theseare linked to Nikon LS-3500 35mm scanners, two to Sharp JX-300 flatbedscanners.andP;  There is also an ECRM Autokon with an ECRM transparency scanningoption, connected to one of the workstations via the ECRM SCSI interface.andP;  Asstated before, this is used for prescreened advertising and some line art.andM;The six image workstations have their own image server with 900 MB of disk,which will soon be expanded to 1.2 GB.andP;  Without compressing the data, some 36hours' worth of high-resolution wire service and scanned images can bestored.andM;Whenever an image is brought into this section, whether from a wire serviceor scanned, a rough crop is made and a low-resolution (72-dpi) version isproduced and sent to the file server waiting for it.andP;  Tone and scalemanipulations and other enhancements are then applied to the high-resolutionversion, which is finally copies into the corresponding page folder locatedon the filmsetting server.andP;  These procedures mean that only high-resolutiontraffic takes place from wire service reception into the image processingsection, and from there to the filmsetting section, both of which are bridgedfrom the rest of the network.andP;  Therefore, this traffic never competes witheditorial traffic.andP;  The swap of the high-resolution images for thelow-resolution versions, which takes place at time of output, is handledautomatically through Xpress if everything is properly is set up, such ascorrect picture naming.andM;The use of low-resolution images in the editorial activity greatlyfacilitates network communications.andP;  A typical tabloid-sized page with two orthree images results in a Quark Xpress document of between 80 and 100 KB.andO;Moving such pages through the network takes a matter of seconds.andP;  El Solhasn't yet detected peak network loads in excess of 25% of nominal capacity.andM;In the image processing section, the only software used is Adobe PhotoShop,which handles both monochrome and color images.andP;  Anaya is quite experiencedin the use of PhotoShop, having been an early beta tester of the softwarewhen it was called Barneyscan SP before its acquisition by Adobe.andP;  As such,Anaya is well practiced in its use, which can be seen in the quality of theoutput of monochrome and color images--as good as anything we have seen in aPostScript newspaper.andP;  This is particularly the case with the wire serviceimages, which are substantially better than if the output had been to aconventional dry-silver printer.andM;The image processing workstations use 24-bit Radius monitors and are manuallycalibrated against PhotoShop color swatches.andP;  Currently, there is no means ofcolor calibration between this and the press, although this additionalfunction is planned and should improve the color quality.andP;  Anaya says thatPhotoShop operators need two weeks of training to be able to produceacceptable color separations.andM;Illustrations.andP;  The third source of images, both monochrome and color, is theillustration section, where six editorial artists use Adobe Illustrator.andO;Within this section is a subsidiary image processing unit for the Sundaymagazine, which has two Macintosh IIx workstations with two Sharp JX-450scanners and one Nikon LS-3500 scanner.andP;  These can be used to scan roughs foruse by the artists.andM;El Sol uses many created images throughout the paper, and there is a highlevel of Illustrator expertise in the group.andP;  Some of the images we saw werevery impressive.andP;  They are used not only for illustrating editorial storiesand features, but also in business pages and for weather maps.andM;Share prices, class and display adsandM;In the financial section of the newspaper, four or five pages are devoted toshare prices.andP;  This information is provided from the Spanish Stock Exchangethrough an IBM PS/2 acting as a terminal to a mainframe.andP;  From this a 3-1/2&quot;MS-DOS floppy disk is taken and read into a Macintosh running Acius 4thDimension database, where it updates stock prices.andM;This database, the program of which was set up by Anaya Systems, keeps trackof a one-year history of prices and volumes, plus all the informationrequired to compute different ratios--max and min, etc.andP;  Different reportingprograms produce the daily, weekly and quarterly listings from the databasein the form of tagged tables.andP;  A specially written Quark Xtension reads thesefiles to produce the &quot;Cotiaciones&quot; pages.andP;  The complete process--reception ofthe daily quotes, updating of the database, calculation of the figures, andproduction of the pages ready for typesetting--takes less than 30 minutes.andM;Within El Sol, facilities for handling classified ads currently are verylimited, but they may grow.andP;  Booking and invoicing are handled manually,although an application for this is being written (not by Anaya Systems) forthe AS/400.andP;  This will produce a file with tagged text that will be read byanother Quark Xtension.andP;  Currently all ads are being typed directly onto apage in Xpress.andP;  We were told that advertising systems are not a majorrequirement in Spain because most advertising for newspapers is taken byindependent sales bureaus that send the ads to the requested newspapers.andM;Display ads are currently being produced in Xpress, although the staff isbeing trained to use MultiAd Creator for more sophisticated ads.andP;  Advertisingartwork that is provided as final screened copy of the right size andproportions is pasted directly into the typeset page.andP;  Otherwise it isscanned on the Autokon and treated as a regular image.andM;High-resolution outputandM;With serious initial concerns about the speed of PostScript output at highresolution, El Sol conducted tests and decided that it could use PostScriptif it had sufficient imagesetting capacity.andP;  Because of Anaya's reputationand the image of El Sol, the company was able to negotiate some veryattractive pricing.andP;  It ended up buying eight PostScript imagesetters withinits allowed budget: four Linotronic 300 recorders driven by RIP4 processorsand four Tegra Varityper 4300P units (now called the 5300 driven by a Series4000 RIP).andM;In operation, El Sol found that the entire newspaper--including monochromeand color pages--could be produced in the required time using just three ofthe Linotronic 300s, with the fourth serving as backup.andP;  Because the Tegramachines aren't needed for producing the paper, they may be transferred toother parts of the group, or they may be used to provide typesetting servicesfor outside customers.andP;  There is also the possibility of replacing the 4300Pswith faster Tegra systems.andM;The typesetters, each of which is controlled by a dedicated Macintosh, areall on the typesetter network with their own typesetter server.andP;  This is aseparate network bridged to the editorial part of the system and connectedthrough a multiport repeater to the image processing network and theproduction terminals.andM;All output is at 1,270 dpi.andP;  At this resolution, black-and-white editorialpages take between two and five minutes, and the four pages of classifiestake a total of 10 minutes.andP;  A front page with two color images and twoIllustrator files (the logo and a small graphic) takes less than 30 minutesfor the four separations.andM;Output is directly from Quark Xpress running in the dedicated typesetterMacintosh.andP;  The connection to each imagesetter is a dedicated LocalTalk link.andO;All pages mentioned above are tabloid format, with an image area of 25cm x40cm (9.875 x 15.75 inches).andM;Load.andP;  The regular newspaper has a total of either 56 pages, of which fouruse color, or 64 pages, in which case eight are in color.andP;  Of these pages, upto 25% contain display and classified advertisements.andP;  Two editions of thenewspaper are produced, a national and a local, with the front page and anaverage of eight interior pages unique to each edition.andP;  In addition to thesepages, there is a daily entertainment section of 12 pages, with four incolor, which is closed 48 hours in advance of the publishing date.andP;  There arealso weekly supplements: a book review (12 pages with one in color);business, real estate and employment (32 pages with two pages of color); themagazine (48 pages with four pages of color); and hobbies (24 pages with twoin color).andM;Altogether the system is currently producing 520 editorial pages a week, with85 of them in color.andP;  The general perception is that the system is operatingat nowhere near its capacity.andM;For printing pairs of pages, imposition is handled manually according toplate sequence.andP;  Pages are sent via two Crosfield PageFax systems to theremote printing site in Illescas (Toledo), about 45 km from Madrid.andO;Transmission is via a fiber-optic link supplied by the Spanish telephonecompany.andP;  The transmission speed is two megabits per second.andP;  Long-run planscall for eliminating the filmsetting operation entirely.andP;  Crosfield isscheduled to supply a direct RIP to the PageFax communications controller tocut out the scanning process.andP;  But this will still utilize the PageFax'sscanner to merge prescreened advertising on the fly with the rasterizedPostScript data.andM;Printing.andP;  Printing of the first edition starts at 9:30 PM and of the secondedition at 2 AM.andP;  Transmission of pages for the first edition starts at 7 PMand continues until 9:15 PM.andP;  The editorial deadline for the color front pageis 8 PM.andP;  Anything, including the color images, can be held until thisdeadline.andM;The quality of the photographic work currently can't be judged by looking atthe newspaper.andP;  The printing quality hasn't been as good as it should be.andO;The company has new presses that are still being adjusted and calibrated.andP;  Welooked at copy produced in the first runs in late May, and also in earlyJuly, and could see an improvement in print quality.andP;  We also have to admitthe quality we saw was substantially better than much of the newspaper colorwe are seeing in other parts of the world, including much of the experimentalPostScript newspaper color in the U.S.andP;  The magazine and supplements are muchbetter, but these are printed on a separate press with better color setups.andM;Color screening.andP;  We were particularly eager to see the quality of screeningof scanned color images, which uses the Anaya color screening algorithms.andO;Anaya claims that its method, for which it is applying for a patent, producesa sharper color image and eliminates moire.andP;  Some of the images we saw,particularly in the magazine section, lived up to these claims.andP;  What Anayais doing is essentially quite simple.andP;  It came out of extensive tests carriedout over the past two years to endeavor to get good-quality color fromPostScript.andM;Anaya found it impossible to achieve consistently acceptable quality usingconventional screen angles, so it experimented with different approaches.andO;The approach it has implemnted (and for which it has applied for a patent)provides for all separations to be output at the same 45[degrees] angle, butfor each separation to be given a horizontal or vertical dot shift.andP;  The sizeof the shift varies with the frequency of the screen.andP;  From tests, Anayaclaims that this approach produces excellent results up to about a 110-linescreen, but in the U.S., MacWeek has produced pages using this method at upto 133-line screens.andM;One claimed benefit of the approach is higher speed of output than if the RIPhas to calculate the different screen angles.andM;El Sol uses the Anaya screening only for continuous-tone scanned colorimages.andP;  Created color images from Adobe Illustrator and tints and text incolor from Quark are output using the standard Adobe screening facilities.andO;In certain cases where type is overlaid into an image, both types ofscreening can be used in the one image.andM;Backup and securityandM;One of our immediate concerns on seeing the structure of the system was whatprovisions will be provided for backing up data.andP;  Also crucial is the overallsecurity in the event of a hardware or software failure.andM;In a few instances, there is mirror writing of data to separate disk drives.andO;This occurs for wire photos and images.andM;Apart from this, there is no duplicate writing of information.andP;  This at firstalarmed us, as it appeared to imply a suicidal, or perhaps hopelesslyoptimistic view that nothing would break down.andP;  In fact, El Sol has extensivedata backup using what could be termed &quot;distributed backup.&quot;andP;  In the processof creating pages, at least four copies of a finished page are stored in thesystem, each on a different disk.andP;  Each reporter has on his own hard disk acopy of the pieces he has produced; a copy of the completed page is presentin the workstation where it has been edited and assembled; from thisworkstation it has been copied into the section file server; and then it iscopied once more to the filmsetting file server, thus accounting for fourcopies.andM;In addition, the high-resolution images are duplicated, being stored once inthe image file server (which has mirror writing of data) and once in thefilmsetter server.andP;  Wire pictures are continuously backed up on another diskfor archival purposes.andM;The worst case scenario might see the breakdown of the filmsetter servercontaining all the pages that are to be typeset.andP;  All the lost pages can becopied again through the network from the section file servers onto a newdisk in less than 10 minutes.andP;  The high-resolution images will also have tobe copied from the image file server to the new disk, a process that takesabout two minutes per page.andM;As page setting can be run in parallel as soon as a few pages have beenregenerated, the regeneration process should not significantly affect thepage-setting process after the initial delay, which would be around 20minutes.andP;  For El Sol this is an acceptable delay, although it might not befor, say, a major, large-scale metro paper in the U.S.andM;If there is a failure in one of the section file servers, the pages would beregenerated from copies and pieces available in the section's workstations.andO;While that server is not operating, it is possible to switch operations toanother section's file server without any real degradation in performance.andO;To facilitate this process, users are instructed always to keep a copy oftheir work on their disk (each user has a minimum of 40 MB) while theinformation is considered &quot;live.&quot;andM;Besides all of the above provisions, there is believed to be sufficient sparenetwork bandwidth to implement a background backup operation using additionalfile servers connected to the backbone if necessary.andP;  So far, this has notbeen considered a requirement.andP;  One benefit of standardizing on Macintosh IIxand IIcx units is that there is a uniformity of the CPUs, so single computerfailures are readily solved by keeping a stock of unused Macs.andM;Network failure.andP;  The possibility of network failure is covered by the use ofthe twin Ethernet backbone.andP;  The transceivers can be manually switchedbetween the two Ethernets in less than 10 minutes if a backbone failureshould occur.andP;  Five extra transceivers (one per floor) are installed on eachbackbone in case of transceiver failure.andP;  If a multiport repeater were tofail, several sections would be disconnected from the backbone, but theywould still be able to work locally while a replacement multiport repeaterwas substituted from the backup stock.andP;  An Ethernet bridge failure would besolved by bypassing that bridge at the cost of increased network traffic.andO;One extra Shiva FastPath is kept for backup in the event that one fails.andM;A failed Ethernet card could produce fatal network interference.andP;  In thiscase, the thin Ethernet cables would have to be unplugged one by one from themultiport repeaters to isolate the section with the failure.andP;  Because allservers and network equipment for a given floor are in one room on thatfloor, this is a simple operation.andP;  Cabling runs radially under the floorfrom this room to each section, and extra cables with connectors ready arekept to bypass cabling problems.andM;Text and picture archivalandM;El Sol is collecting 400 wire pictures a day, of which about 250 meritpermanent archiving.andP;  In addition, the newspaper's photographers take about1,000 shots per day and store about 400 negatives.andP;  the newspaper has decidedthat it wants to have archival systems for these pictures, feeling that theycould become a secondary source of income.andM;To handle this need, it has installed a MARS archive and retrieval systemfrom Micro Dynamics (Washington, DC).andP;  Built around a 48-GB optical discjukebox, this system will be used to archive wire pictures, the full text ofthe newspaper, magazine clippings and other reference documents.andO;Low-resolution versions of the wire service images will be stored in thejukebox, together with reference and keyword information.andP;  The correspondinghigh-resolution images will be stored in a library of WORM discs, probablycompressed in the JPEG format.andM;Searches will be made on keyword information; the results of a search will bea preview of the low-resolution image, together with a reference to thecartridge containing the high-resolution data.andM;Access to the jukebox will be the same as access to any other server in thesystem, subject to having the correct access privileges.andP;  At the time of ourvisit, the archival/retrieval system was still being installed, so we wereunable to see it in operation or comment on how it works as part of theoverall system.andM;Does the system work?andM;There is no doubt that the system works and that it produces a goodnewspaper.andP;  The color is at least as good as much of the color we seeelsewhere.andP;  AppleShare's speed is acceptable for the needs of a dailynewspaper.andP;  The times for page production are acceptable--faster than anewspaper running color through Scitex Visionary terminals into a Scitexsystem.andP;  Pages can be kept open later.andP;  This particularly applies to colorimages created with Adobe Illustrator.andP;  In the future, we see this improvingwith higher-speed PostScript RIPs, particularly where these are installed atremote locations.andM;We admit that the editorial system works, but we feel that the use of QuarkXtensions to automate the copying of templates and the cutting and pasting oftext from one page into another would make the whole process easier andfaster.andM;Quark Xpress as editor.andP;  We had expected to find reporters unhappy with theuse of Xpress as a writing and editing tool, but this was not the case.andP;  Infact, we found a number of people who had previously worked on Atex systemsat other newspapers, and in most cases they have found the interactiveWYSIWYG approach in building pages better than the coded, non-WYSIWYGstructure of Atex.andM;We were told that the newspaper's art director, a former Atex user, hadbecome a dedicated Xpress convert within a month of joining the paper.andO;Journalists working for the first time on an electronic publishing systemtook to the system like &quot;a duck to water,&quot; and training was very quick.andM;The lack of a mail or message system is not seen as a problem because allsections of the paper are compact work groups; most of the editorialdepartment works on the same floor and can easily walk to other sections.andP;  Inthis respect, many of the practices used are similar to those of anonelectronic newspaper.andP;  For example, the use of the LaserWriter to printeach wire service picture, which is distributed around the paper, is similarto a conventional procedure.andP;  the use of paper proofs rather than electronicbrowsing through screen-resolution images has proven to be very successful.andM;Limitations.andP;  But there are many limitations.andP;  The fact that copy is held inmultiple locations throughout the newspaper means it is a major task toensure that copy is deleted from all systems and that correct naming andnumbering procedures are maintained.andP;  For example, if there is any change toa picture number between the high- and low-resolution images, then Xpresscannot find the image at the time of output.andP;  A central filing system wouldget around some of this, but would increase the network loadings and accesstimes.andM;Quark Xpress, while being one of the major elements that has allowed thepaper to be produced, is also one of its biggest problems.andP;  These problemsmainly concern copy protection and the handamp;j/typesetting tables.andM;The whole Quark structure is a real problem because of its single-userorientation.andP;  Quark views a system as a workstation, not multipleworkstations.andP;  There is no concept of system software with Quark, justindividual copies of Xpress.andP;  If any typographic settings are changed on oneworkstation, they don't get carried around with the page when it moves toanother workstation.andM;Handamp;J preferences are associated with a workstation, not a document, so Xpresswill generate new line endings on a page at output if the workstation'ssettings are different.andP;  This means that users have to be forbidden frommaking any changes to the typographic preferences in their workstations.andO;This isn't likely to be such a problem in some other publishing applications,such as books or even magazines, where only one person may work on a page ora series of pages because it isn't necessary to transfer files for additionalwork elsewhere.andP;  In book composition, for example, the transfer usuallyinvolves PostScript files, not Xpress pages.andP;  If changes are made, they maynot be seen until the high-resolution output, since the A3-sized proof isoutput from the pagination workstation, not the one driving the typesetter.andM;Anaya, a major user of Xpress, has spent $60,000 on this software--70 copiesat El Sol and 30 copies for book production.andM;Copy protection.andP;  At El Sol, another major problem is Quar's copy protection,which requires every user always to have a floppy disk.andP;  For a newspaper,this is bad practice.andP;  The management would like to restrict the use offloppy disks in workstations.andP;  (No other software used by El Sol requiressuch copy protection; it can be run from the hard disk without a floppy keydisk.)andM;El Sol has experienced problems with the reliability of the Quark floppydisks and with the attitude of Quark toward requests for replacement copieswhen disks wear out.andP;  In our opinion, $60,000 is a high price to pay forsoftware for such a newspaper, particularly when there is no integration orreasonable support and training service.andP;  We feel that Quark's attitude andits approach to large installations such as El Sol are unacceptable.andP;  Keepingin mind that professional publishing is one of Quark's largest businessareas, we think the company's extremely unhelpful attitude is disappointing,to say the least.andP;  We are sometimes surprised that publishers put up with theapproach Quark takes in areas such as improving hyphenation and in sitelicensing.andM;System pricing.andP;  The total system installed at El Sol, including the fullnetwork, all the Macintosh computers, the eight PostScript typesetters andtwo Autokons, has cost $3.2 million.andP;  The Crosfield PageFax systems cost anadditional $1 million.andP;  For this, the company got a full editorial,advertising and pagination system, with an extensive graphics capability inboth monochrome and color.andM;Benefits.andP;  It is too early to say how successful the newspaper will be inattracting the readers it is looking for.andP;  What we can say is that it isoffering more than its competitors in handling extensive color, andparticularly with its creative art, it is very different from other Spanishnewspapers.andM;Its image quality looks better than its competitors', particularly on wireservice pictures, where the Anaya Picture Desk's digital conversion producesexcellent quality.andP;  Color quality is good and getting better.andP;  We expectimprovements in this as the systems and the presses become better calibrated,and as enhancements are soon made to the presses.andM;We also expect real improvements in deadlines, which are already reasonable,when Crosfield supplies its high-speed RIP (we belive this is from Hyphen) togo directly into the PageFax system, at which time we might expect the fourseparations of a color page to be produced in less than 10 minutes.andM;We can say, therefore, that it is possible to produce a color daily newspaperusing standard off-the-shelf, shrink-wrapped software for networking, textand page handling and graphics, providing you have an excellent systemintegrator.andP;  You do have to accept restrictions in the lack of an underlyingsystems layer, which brings about restrictions and requires more manualprocesses.andP;  But we see this changing in the future with the availability ofQuark Xtensions for a wide variety of functions.andP;  We believe that if El Sol,or any other newspaper with an excellent understanding of system andintegration issues, were to start now with the tools that are now available,they could produce very impressive systems.andM;Curious about some of the decisions Anaya made, we asked a few questions ofMarcel Coderch, the managing director of Anaya Systems, the person behindAnaya's color screening algorithms and one of the key architects of El Sol'ssystems.andP;  In response to a question about why he had not used a particularfunction, he said, &quot;Unfortunately, it was not available at the time weplanned the sytem, and now it will be difficult to change work procedures.andO;Well .andP;  .  .  , let's leave something to try on our next installation!&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
