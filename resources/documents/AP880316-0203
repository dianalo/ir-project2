(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Officials who considered going out ofbusiness to avoid road maintenance costs have decided the cost ofnot having a town government could be much higher.   Expected development at the gateway to adjacent VoyageursNational Park requires a government, with its planning and zoningpowers, the officials decided.   ``We're never going to have the kind of crowds they have atYellowstone, Yosemite or Glacier, but the traffic's going toincrease,'' Mayor Mike Williams said Tuesday. ``We're going to getsome development and we're going to have to have planning tocontrol it.''   The opening last summer of the national park's visitor centerspurred the beginnings of new development, including a recentlybuilt mobile home park and plans for a condominium project.   Officials hope to stay ahead of any development by finishing acomprehensive plan within a year, the mayor said.   Officials also were swayed by residents of this northernMinnesota town of 101 people, who opposed the plan just as they hada similar proposal in 1984.   Officials hoped to pass their road maintenance costs on toKoochiching County by dissolving the government. Improvement of thetown's five miles of mostly gravel roads was estimated to cost asmuch as $200,000, but the town could barely afford its $8,000maintenance budget.</TEXT></DOC>
