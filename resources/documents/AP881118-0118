(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The government agreed Friday to not send13 Cuban detainees back to their homeland until after theirattorneys have a chance to study administrative files in Washington.   ``We shouldn't deport anybody until we get the records, shouldwe?'' asked U.S. District Judge U.W. Clemon at an informal hearingon a request for a preliminary injunction against the JusticeDepartment.   The request for a restraining order claimed the Cubans had beendenied political asylum ``without a full or adequate opportunity toestablish their persecution claims.'' It claimed they were entitledto a hearing before an immigration judge.   ``If deported to Cuba, they will suffer irreparable harm,''lawyers Leo Ochoa and Robert L. Boyer of Miami said in their request.   Assistant U.S. Attorney George C. Batcheler promised that nodeportation efforts will be made until the records arrive.   Clemon postponed the hearing indefinitely.   ``We'll wait until we are notified by the U.S. attorney that therecords have arrived,'' said Leo Ochoa, an attorney for the Cubans.``We're not in as big a hurry as the government.''   The 13 are among 110 deportable Cubans at the FederalCorrectional Institution at Talladega, about 60 miles east ofBirmingham. They were among 125,000 people who came to the UnitedStates from Mariel, Cuba, in 1980 in the so-called ``FreedomFlotilla'' boatlift; many of them had criminal records or mentalillness.   The government served notice Thursday on 15 Cubans at Talladegathat they would be deported within 72 hours. The 15 have beenconvicted of crimes ranging from burglary to first-degree murder,the Justice Department said in a statement.   Ochoa said two of the 15 had not asked him to represent them.   Three-member repatriation review panels set up by the JsticeDepartment have reviewed the cases of 28 Cubans and recommended thatthe 15 be returned home. The panels were created after last year'sprison riots by Cuban detainees at Atlanta and Oakdale, La.,triggered by an agreement with Cuban President Fidel Castro toresume sending many of the detainees home.   The review panels will make further reviews of the remaining 13of the 28 to determine if they should be deported or released.   At Miami, meanwhile, members of the Cuban community appealed toPresident Reagan to block the deportation.   Rafael Penalver, who heads a task force aimed at protecting thedetainees, asked the Reagan administration to consider the wishes ofsome of its staunchest supporters.   ``In the waning days of the Reagan presidency, we are making anappeal to the president not to leave as one of his legacies thecommencement of the deportation process of Cuban exiles to FidelCastro's hands,'' Penalver said.   Penalver said the prisoners have completed their sentences andare being unjustly deported only because they arrived on the Marielboatlift.   The Immigration and Naturalization Service has released on paroleabout 2,400 of 3,822 detainees. Another 400 have been approved forparole and are awaiting release, said INS spokesman Duke Austin.Those denied parole received a special review.</TEXT></DOC>
