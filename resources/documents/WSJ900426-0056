GE said its Aircraft Engines division received a new orderfrom the state-owned airline valued at $300 million.</LP><TEXT>   At the same time, Thai Airways said it had placed an orderwith United Technologies' Pratt andamp; Whitney division, whichcould total $240 million if options for $80 million in extraengines are executed.   The order to Pratt andamp; Whitney is significant because itincreases the company's penetration at an airline that untillast July bought GE engines exclusively for 14 years. Theorder comes in the wake of a $500,000 gift by UnitedTechnologies to a charity run by the Thai royal family.   In East Hartford, Conn., a Pratt andamp; Whitney spokesmanreiterated the company's position that the donation to atyphoon-relief fund, which was reported last December, wasn'tconditioned on receiving new engine orders.   It's natural for the company to engage in philanthropy&quot;where we want to establish business relationships and becomeinvolved,&quot; the spokesman said, adding: &quot;That money was usedto help people {and} it may have been a factor or may nothave&quot; in the engine order decision. &quot;If that helped us in ourbusiness that's fine.&quot;   United Technologies is based in Hartford, Conn., and isalso involved in building systems and automotive products.GE, based in Fairfield, Conn., has interests in broadcasting,financial services, and industrial products.   The competition between the two companies to supply ThaiAirways has intensified during the past year. Last summer,officials at the airline said the Thai government asked thecarrier to order Pratt andamp; Whitney engines instead of some GEequipment on order because the government believed Pratt andamp;Whitney had closer ties to the Bush administration and couldimprove Thailand's relations with the U.S. Meanwhile, bothengine makers were said to be offering significantconcessions to the carrier in return for business.   These latest orders have importance beyond the issue ofwhich company gets to call Thai Airways its customer.Thailand is just one prize in a larger sweepstakes foraerospace concerns as they fight for pieces of Asianbusiness, the world's fastest-growing commercial aircraftmarket.   According to industry estimates, air passenger traffic to,from and within Asia will grow an average 9% annually duringthe next 10 years, almost twice the projected growth for theU.S.   The significance of the Thai Airways business wasunderscored yesterday as John F. Welch Jr., GE chairman,announced at the company's annual meeting in Erie, Pa., thelatest award to GE. The order covers the company's highestthrust engines, the CF6-80C2 and 80E1, to power five BoeingCo. 747-400s and four A330s built by Airbus Industrie, theEuropean aircraft consortium. Both planes are widebodyaircraft.   The Thai airline will take initial delivery of the747-400s in late 1991; the A330s are scheduled for deliveryin 1993.   The order to Pratt andamp; Whitney is for PW4000 engines topower Airbus A300s, A310s and A330s.   The order includes the conversion of existing options forfive PW4000-powered A300-600R twinjets into firm orders, andtwo PW4000s to power a new Airbus A310 for the Royal Thai AirForce. Deliveries will begin in 1991. The rest of the ordercovers engines for four A330s and spares.</TEXT></DOC>
