The general strike was expected to be a test for President MaungMaung, who came to power Friday and is Burma's first civilianleader in the 26 years since a military coup replaced democracywith one-party rule.   A messenger representing student groups, defying an 8 p.m. to 4a.m. curfew, ran through residential areas of Rangoon to rallysupport for the strike, the Japanese news agency reported from theBurmese capital.   Soldiers stood at major points in the center of Rangoon, wherebarbed wire barricades had been erected to guard againstdemonstrators, Kyodo said, adding that people were seen cuttingpalm trees on the roads to set up barricades against the military.   The report quoted unidentified sources as saying a large numberof demonstrators rode trucks into the capital on Sunday night.   An Asian diplomat in Rangoon said the city was ``relativelyquiet'' Monday morning.   For the sixth straight day Sunday, authorities released peoplearrested in Rangoon during Aug. 8-12 riots that prompted theresignation of Maung Maung's predecessor, Sein Lwin, after only 17days in power. Troops fired into crowds of demonstrators in theriots, and the government said 112 people were killed.   Official Radio Rangoon said 100 people were freed Sunday,bringing the total reported released in Rangoon to 408. Thousandsof people are still believed detained.   On Saturday, people demonstrated peacefully in Mandalay, Burma'ssecond-largest city, and in five other towns, according to RadioRangoon.   The state-run newspaper Working People's Daily reported Saturdaythat during the Aug. 8-12 protests, hysterical mobs decapitated atleast five people, including three police officers, in the Rangoonsuburb of North Okkalapa.   ``Two of the (policemen's) heads were stuck on bamboo poles andone was put on a stool for all to see,'' according to thenewspaper, obtained Sunday from a Western embassy in Bangkok. Thereport said the protesters then burned the bodies.   One of the victims was a civilian mistaken for an intelligenceagent and beheaded after a mob stoned him to death, it said.   ``The leader of the demonstration in North Okkalapa townshipwore a hood to hide his face as he screamed at the top of his voicefor the emergence of the `Aung Gyi government,''' the newspapersaid.   Aung Gyi, the country's leading dissident, was arrested withseveral other prominent figures July 29-30. Among those seized wasSein Win, the Burma correspondent of The Associated Press.   The wave of turmoil in Burma began July 27, when leader Ne Winresigned and Sein Lwin came to power. A retired army general, SeinLwin was widely hated for ruthlessly suppressing dissent, anddisturbances began almost immediately.   At first peaceful, the demonstrations became violent on Aug. 8and security personnel fired shots to disperse the crowds. Someprotesters fought back and the government said 112 people werekilled and 267 wounded in Rangoon. Diplomats there believe hundredsmay have been killed.   The violence continued until Aug. 12, when Sein Lwin resigned.But smaller, student-led protests continued almost daily to pressfor an end to one-party rule and for economic reforms.   The Asian diplomat said the government was unlikely to agree tomulti-party democracy after a quarter-century of iron-fistedcontrol by the Burma Socialist Program Party, founded by Gen. NeWin. The general led the March 2, 1962, coup that toppled theelected government of Prime Minister U Nu.   Burmese media also have rejected the idea of returning to amulti-party system, noting in recent days that the governmentduring Burma's 14 years of democracy was corrupt and inefficient.But officials have said in recent days that the current governmentalso is corrupt.   A Western diplomat, who asked for anonymity, said Saturday thatMaung Maung has remained silent on the issue. The president did notflatly reject democracy in his speech Friday before the emergencyparty session that elected him.</TEXT></DOC>
