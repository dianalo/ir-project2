The Banking Commission said it wants Mr. De Benedetti to reveal the identities of all the allies that he claims are helping him in his fight against a Franco-Belgian group for control of Generale de Belgique. A commission spokesman said the request is a normal one in a public offer and is being made because Mr. De Benedetti claims the allies as a key part of his strategy.    Mr. De Benedetti's allies hold slightly more than half the 47.2% stake in Generale de Belgique that he claims to control. Some of the allies already have been identified, but financial sources said others wanted to maintain their anonymity, presenting Mr. De Benedetti with a serious dilemma. Without an extension, his offer of 8,000 Belgian francs ($226.05) a share for an additional 7% of the big Belgian holding company will expire at the end of trading today.    Analysts said Mr. De Benedetti wants to extend his bid in the hope of pressuring companies in the rival Franco-Belgian alliance to accept the offer. The Franco-Belgian group, led by the French holding company Cie. Financiere de Suez, claims to control a majority of the shares of Generale de Belgique.    Meanwhile, sources said Suez is planning a capital increase soon, in part to reimburse its investment in the Belgian holding company. The sources said the capital increase is likely to total about four billion French francs ($697.5 million), the estimated value of Suez's investment in Generale de Belgique, and that it is likely to be made through a share offer.    Suez financed its investment in part with advances from its so-called core shareholders, and wants to pay them back in shares through the capital increase. This also would result in several of these shareholders raising their stakes in Suez, thus making it less vulnerable to a possible takeover attempt. Sources said Suez also intends to offer shares to the public. </TEXT></DOC>
