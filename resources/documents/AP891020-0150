Officials even told the covert team to find embarrassinginformaton on U.N. officials as part of an effort to ensure that ablack nationalist group does come to power, Susan Dobson was quotedas saying by the Namibian newspaper.   Mrs. Dobson quit her job in South Africa's Bureau of Informationand subsequently claimed she had been a spy for the AfricanNational Congress while working for the government.   She was quoted Friday as saying that her part of her duties withthe Bureau of Information included a campaign to discredit theSouth-West Africa People's Organization and the U.N. contingentthat is coordinating Namibia's transition to independence.   Louis Pienaar, the South African administrator of Namibia,denied covert activities were being conducted by his office. Hesaid the Bureau of Information was involved in telling the publicabout election procedures and that the South African governmentprovided additional staff for that purpose.   However, a U.N. official said authorities with the world bodybelieve a covert smear campaign might exist.   ``I would have to confess (the report) did not take us totallyby surprise,'' said U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard, referring to Mrs.Dobson's allegations.   There was ``a pattern that certainly raised questions in ourminds whether there might not be some kind of orchestrated effort''by the South Africans, he said.   South Africa has ruled Namibia for 74 years, but agreed to grantthe territory independence under U.N. supervison. Elections for anational assembly are set for Nov. 7-11 and independence isexpected early next year.   The South-West Africa People's Organization, which waged a23-year bush war against South African rule, is heavily favored inthe polls.   Mrs. Dobson abruptly left her job in the Namibian capital ofWindhoek on Sept. 23 and flew to London with her South Africanhusband, Peter Dobson. The Namibian, which supports the South-WestAfrica People's Organization, interviewed the couple there.   Mrs. Dobson said she was part of a seven-member governmentcontingent with a $1.3 million budget.   The group was to help promote the Democratic Turnhalle Alliance,a multiracial coalition that favors a capitalist economy.   She said the team was instructed to gather information on U.N.officials for the purpose of embarrassing them. The group had anentertainment allowance of $38,000 for this purpose, she told thenewspaper.   Any embarrassing information was to be fed to ``selectedjournalists'' working for newspapers opposed to the blacknationalist group, she said.   Mrs. Dobson said she also was sent to interview Hans Dreyer,commander of the notorious police counterinsurgency unit, Koevoet.She said she was told to portray the unit as a ``group of ordinary,decent people doing a great job.''   Mrs. Dobson said her group included two members of the SouthAfrican Defense Force, a police inspector, and intelligenceofficials.   She said she and her husband have worked for the outlawedAfrican National Congress for 10 years. She said they fled becausethey believed they had been uncovered.   Dave Steward, head of the Bureau of Information, said Wednesdaythat Mrs. Dobson ``was a junior official who did not have access tosensitive material. The information she gained was available toanyone.''</TEXT></DOC>
