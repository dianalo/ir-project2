Varo, a maker of navigational and night-viewing systems, said United Scientific Holdings PLC sent it a letter saying that United was prepared to offer $26 a share, or about $106 million, for the 90.4% of Varo that United doesn't already own.    James F. Gero, Varo chairman and chief executive officer, said the company and its advisers will study the proposal.    United, a London-based holding company that has been chasing Varo for several months, said its bid is contingent upon regulatory clearance, a definitive agreement, a due diligence review and the redemption of Varo's poison-pill anti-takeover measure. United, which also makes night-viewing systems, sought clearance under antitrust laws in April but that hasn't yet been granted.    On Monday, Varo signed a definitive agreement to be acquired by Imo Delaval Inc., of Lawrenceville, N.J., for $113 million. That agreement allows Imo Delaval, an instruments and controls supplier, to buy 835,350 unissued Varo shares, or an 18% stake, if the transaction isn't completed. Imo Delavel began a tender offer for Varo in an advertisement in today's Wall Street Journal.    Despite the agreement, Varo's stock has been trading above the $25 a share offer, indicating the market's optimism that a higher bid will emerge. In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Wednesday, Varo closed at $25.50, up 12.5 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
