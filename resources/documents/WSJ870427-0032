BirnbaumStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 04/27/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> GOVMTECONOMIC NEWS (ECO)EXECUTIVE (EXE)CONGRESS (CNG)TREASURY DEPARTMENT (TRE) </IN><DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Two top Reagan administration officials quietly visited Capitol Hill to plead with congressional leaders to approve an increase in the U.S. borrowing limit on a timely basis.    Missing the mid-May deadline, the officials warned, could cause an unprecedented default by the U.S. government. In response, the congressional leaders said they would work to pass the legislation on time.    As a way to ease passage of the debt-ceiling bill, the administration officials were urged to negotiate a compromise with Congress on a federal budget plan. But they declined. Before becoming involved in any serious budget talks, the White House is demanding that Democrats, who control both chambers of Congress, produce their own budget.    White House Chief of Staff Howard Baker, Treasury Secretary James Baker, Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd (D., W.Va.) and Senate Minority Leader Robert Dole (R., Kan.) attended the meeting, held late Friday afternoon in a room near the Senate chamber. The Reagan administration officials requested the meeting to talk about the debt ceiling.    The chief of staff and the Treasury secretary said they hoped the debt-limit legislation would be approved before the May 15 deadline, although they said the government might have enough cash to continue operating until about May 27, according to individuals familiar with the meeting. A letter to congressional leaders from the administration outlining the need for prompt action is expected as early as today.    The two Messrs. Baker told the senators that they wanted the debt-ceiling increase to be approved &quot;clean&quot; -- without amendment. This would be a departure from past practice, in which all sorts of extraneous legislation has been attached to the bill, often as a way to get it passed. Debt-ceiling fights are traditionally messy and prolonged.    This year, Democratic leaders in the House have spoken about attaching a measure that would impose across-the-board cuts in government spending if mandated spending limits are exceeded. The twist to the provision is that the president would be forced to sign such an order to make the cuts -- an act the Democrats bet he wouldn't undertake because it would sharply curb military spending.    Sen. Byrd told the officials that he would consult with House Speaker James Wright (D., Texas), who was out of town and couldn't attend the meeting, about how best to approve the debt-ceiling increase.    The current federal borrowing limit is $2.3 trillion. By statute, that amount falls back to last year's limit of $2.1 trillion on May 15, if action isn't taken. The result is the possibility of default on U.S. securities. In past years, the debt limit stayed in place, making the worst consequence a temporary shutdown of federal offices.    During Friday's meeting, Sen. Byrd told the officials that he was eager to sit down with them and President Reagan to work out a compromise on the budget resolution. But Chief of Staff Baker replied that, though he would be happy to talk, he wasn't empowered to make any deals.    &quot;It's important that the president get involved,&quot; Sen. Byrd was quoted as saying.    Chief of Staff Baker responded that he wasn't authorized to say what is or isn't negotiable. He emphasized that he wasn't &quot;putting revenues on the table.&quot; This meant that he couldn't say that President Reagan would accept a tax increase. The leading Democratic budget plans in Congress call for a tax increase of about $18 billion in fiscal 1988, which begins Oct. 1.    Mr. Baker noted that the president feels strongly about the need to continue the military buildup, in contrast to the proposed slowdown in growth in the Democratic budget plans. The Senate is expected to begin debate as early as today on its own budget plan; the House passed its budget plan earlier this month.    Separately, a supplemental appropriations bill for the current fiscal year was approved early Friday morning by the House. It outlined spending of $9 billion. The original measure, totaling about $11 billion, was pared late in the debate by an amendment offered by Rep. Buddy MacKay (D., Fla.).    The MacKay amendment trimmed the legislation by about $2 billion in order to bring it within budget limits set by the Congress last year. It cut a variety of programs, but left untouched aid to the homeless. After the vote on the MacKay amendment, House Majority Leader Thomas Foley (D., Wash.) said: &quot;This just means we're being responsible.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
