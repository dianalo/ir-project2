In a speech before theGerman parliament earlier in the day, Willy Brandt, WestBerlin's former mayor and West Germany's former chancellor,drew an analogy: It would have been unthinkable, he said, forthe French provisional government to have remained in Vichyafter the liberation of Paris at the end of World War II.   Americans contributed an enormous amount to the defense ofWest Berlin as an island of freedom in a red sea for morethan 40 years. Gen. Lucius Clay led the Berlin airlift todefeat the Soviet blockade of the city in 1948-49. Thousandsof Americans contributed their dollars to send a replica ofthe Liberty Bell from Philadelphia to Berlin, where it hangstoday. West Berlin's Free University was founded with majorgrants from the Ford Foundation. Many of the city's streetsand squares are named after Americans, including John F.Kennedy. It was Ronald Reagan who called on Mikhail Gorbachevto tear down the wall during his visit to West Berlin in1987. And George Bush supported Chancellor Helmut Kohl'sefforts to unify Germany in 1990.</LP><TEXT>   Forty-four years of communism has left East Germanybankrupt. The selection of Berlin as united Germany's capitalsends a powerful message of reconciliation to the EastGermans. The high costs of unity -- billions of marks in newtaxes -- are not their fault, even though many West Germanshave suggested that the costs are somehow more important thanending the division of Germany. (In March, for example, thechairman of the Bundesbank, Karl Otto Poehl, called thecurrency union of last July an &quot;economic disaster.&quot;)   Some in Germany still complain about the financial cost ofunification, as though unity were a commodity which is notonly too expensive, but which they didn't have to buy. But itwas not a commodity. The unity of Germany in 1990 was not amatter of choice. If the question of unity had been leftunresolved, it would very likely be impossible today, giventhe intervening changes in the Soviet Union. Mr. Kohl's greatservice to his country was to conclude that history does notrepeat its offers.   A visitor to the former East Berlin, and to the formerEast Germany, will return this summer with a picture ofincredible variety. The dilapidated buildings pose a sharpcontrast to the flower stands and decorated store windowsthat are new since the wall came down. The Germans, all ofthem, are enjoying individual liberty for the first timesince 1933.   It is true that there are still two different economiclandscapes in Germany. But that is changing quickly. There ismassive unemployment. But the unemployed are learning newjobs. There are sausage stands where there were none, andthousands of people are learning how to drive a car. Stolenand state-owned property is being returned to its owners, andinvestment by companies from Western Europe and the U.S. isincreasing week by week.   Berlin with its boulevards and linden trees was a grandand splendid city. It now has the opportunity to prove thatits defense by the West for the past 44 years was justified.The defense of Berlin, after all, was not a side show of theCold War -- it was here that the West and the Soviet Uniontwice came to the verge of war, once during the 1948-49blockade and again in 1961-62.   The East Germans will succeed in meeting the challenges offreedom, just as did those fortunate enough to live in WestGermany after the war, who created one of the pillars ofdemocracy in postwar Europe. In this process of change, thedecision between Bonn or Berlin is crucial. To have let thecapital remain in Bonn would have represented a vote for thecomfort of the past, instead of looking to the future. SinceNovember 1989 Chancellor Kohl and Foreign Minister HansDietrich Genscher, as well as President Richard vonWeizsacker, have repeatedly underscored their conviction thatthe future of peace and freedom in Europe rests, not with aGerman Europe, but with a European Germany. Berlin, as thecapital of Germany, in the center of free Europe, will play amajor role in this Germany.   With Berlin as the German capital, the East Germans aregiven not only a vote of confidence and respect, but also thecommitment that their city is important, that their strugglesof the past and the present do matter. As the mayor of Berlinat the height of the blockade in 1949, Ernst Reuter, said,&quot;People of the world, look at this city]&quot; Fourteen yearslater, in 1963, it was not for nothing that John F. Kennedysaid, &quot;Ich bin ein Berliner]&quot; Today, Berlin is part of thefuture of Europe, and no longer an island. No smallaccomplishment, that.   ---   Mr. Bark is a fellow at Stanford University's HooverInstitution, in Palo Alto, Calif.</TEXT></DOC>
