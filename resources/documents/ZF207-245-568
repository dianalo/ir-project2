Therewas a surprising degree of commonality in the answers,'' Morris said.andM;Customers listed a sales rep's responsiveness as the most important trait,followed by product knowledge, accessibility, account knowledge and marketintelligence.andM;Portable computers, which provide large amounts of data in an accessiblepackage, can help sales reps enhance their skills in each of the five areas,Morris said.andM;Moreover, companies that automate their sales forces should see significantincreases in efficiency and revenue.andP;  Within a year, Morris estimates, acompany can realize a 30 percent savings in administrative time, an 18percent reduction in telephone costs, a 10 percent increase in revenue and a40 percent drop in sales-force attrition.andM;Portables are especially helpful in fields that offer thousands of items forthe sales rep to remember, according to Larry Frank, president of SalesPartner Systems, a value-added reseller in Daytona Beach, Fla.andP;  In fooddistribution, for instance, reps often must carry a bulky price book plus atrunk full of brochures on the products a company stocks, he said.andM;''Can you imagine flipping through a 15,000-item price book for a quickanswer to your customer's request for a specific price?'' Frank asked.andM;Despite the benefits to users who choose portable computers, pitfalls inautomating a sales force do exist, according to Envoy's Morris.andM;For example, ''firehosing'' the sales staff -- providing too much technologyat once -- can lead to PC rejection, he said.andM;Managers should take a week or two to demonstrate how a machine works and toeducate the representative with various sales applications over severalmonths, he said.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
