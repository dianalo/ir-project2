Jackson won in Georgia, Mississippi, Virginia and Alabama,fighting off a strong challenge here by Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore,whose state campaign leader said Jackson should be disappointed byhis showing in Louisiana and worried about Gore's challenge.   ``We feel that a turnaround has come, and again looking furtherdown the road we feel that Sen. Gore can pull the Democratic Partyback together,'' said Bud Courson, Gore's state campaigncoordinator.   With 3,180 of 3,272 precincts, or 97 percent, reporting, Jacksonhad 214,426 votes, or 34 percent; Gore had 177,279, or 29 percent;Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis had 95,309, or 15 percent; andMissouri Rep. Richard Gephardt tallied 66,357, or 11 percent.   With reports in from 3,166 of the 3,272 precincts, or 97percent, Bush had 85,837 votes, or 59 percent; Kansas Sen. Bob Doletallied 25,710, or 18 percent; former television evangelist PatRobertson had 25,601, or 18 percent; and New York Rep. Jack Kemphad 7,614, or 5 percent.   The results apparently translate into 31 delegates for Jackson,23 for Gore and seven for Dukakis and two for Gephardt. On theRepublican side, Bush nabbed 34 delegates with seven uncommitted.   Greg Beuerman, Dole's Louisiana campaign boss, said he was notsurprised by the vote and the pendulum would shift to Dole in theMidwest primaries. ``The South is to George Bush what the Midwesthas been to Bob Dole,'' he said.   In the 4th Congressional District race to replace DemocraticGov.-elect Buddy Roemer in the U.S. House, Roemer's former aide JimMcCrery, a Republican, and Democratic state Sen. Foster Campbellclaimed spots in an April 16 runoff.   McCrery, the sole Republican in the race, led the 10-candidatefield. Roemer voiced support for former Shreveport Journal editorStan Tiner during the campaign.   However, Tiner ran third as McCrery and Campbell, a statesenator since 1976, claimed runoff spots. McCrery tallied 31percent of the vote to 19 percent for Campbell.</TEXT></DOC>
