The Mobile, Ala., food-service company blamed the below-expectation results on problems with customer traffic and margin erosion.    It said it has intensified marketing, promotion and cost control efforts, and expects to overcome the problems in the family-dining division so that the remainder of the fiscal year will meet its goals.    For the year-ago fiscal first quarter, the company reported net income of $6.6 million, or 37 cents a share, including profit from discontinued operations of $410,000, or two cents a share, on sales of $185 million. </TEXT></DOC>
