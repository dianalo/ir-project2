Police arrested journalists, including a television crew of thegovernment-run South African Broadcasting Corp., and many of thedemonstrators as they marched toward the Cape Town Supreme Courtfrom a Methodist church on the central Greenmarket Square.   Earlier, police blocked an attempted march from the square tothe courthouse, 1,500 feet away, by about 30 Moslem women.   Placards saying, ``Release our comrades,'' and referring to asecurity policeman as a torturer, were confiscated.   The 14 defendants have been accused of a series of bombings onbehalf of the outlawed ANC guerrilla movement. The defendants havetestified that police tortured them while in custody.   Protest organizers said the demonstration was part of a new,national, anti-apartheid defiance campaign. The campaign is tofocus on what government opponents see as political trials and theexecution of political prisoners.   In August, opposition groups began defying restrictions and heldrallies and marches to protest segregated beaches, hospitals,schools, buses and other facilities.   President F.W. de Klerk last week declared all beaches open toall races and called for the repeal of the Separate Amenities Act,which allows segregation of most public facilities. However,housing, schools and hospitals are not covered by the act and willremain segregated.   On Wednesday, about 140 members of the National Association ofDemocratic Lawyers held placards on the steps outside theJohannesburg Supreme Court to protest the death penalty. SouthAfrica has one of world's highest rates for executions.   Police did not interfere with the protest.</TEXT></DOC>
