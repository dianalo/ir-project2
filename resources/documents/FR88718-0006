Background </ITAG>Section 210 of PURPA requires electric utilities to sell electricity to,and purchase electricity from, qualifying small power production facilities.The Federal Power Act (FPA) defines ``small power production facility''to include facilities with a power production capacity of 80 megawattsor less that produce electric energy solely by the use of renewable resources.\4\<NOTE/> The Commission has interpreted ``renewable resources'' toinclude water used at a hydroelectric project located at either an existingdam or a new dam or diversion.\5\<NOTE/> Therefore, a small hydroelectric project qualifies as a ``smallpower production facility'' and may seek PURPA benefits.\6\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ 16 U.S.C. 796(17)(A) (1982). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ Small Power Production and Cogeneration Facilities_QualifyingStatus, 45 FR 17959 at 17966 (Mar. 20, 1980), FERC Stats. andamp; Regs. [RegulationsPreambles 1977-1981] andpara; 30,134 (Mar. 13, 1980). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\ The term ``PURPA benefits'' refers to the provision insection 210 of PURPA that requires electric utilities to purchase electricityfrom, and sell electricity to, any qualifying facility. A. Section 8 ofECPASection 8(a) of ECPA amends section 210 of PURPA to add a new section 210(j).Section 210(j) establishes three new environmental requirements that ahydroelectric project located at a new dam or diversion must satisfy beforeit can qualify for PURPA benefits. In addition, section 8(e) of ECPA imposesa moratorium on PURPA benefits for such projects. The purpose of the moratoriumis to allow Congress time to evaluate whether PURPA benefits should continueto be extended to hydroelectric projects located at new dams or diversions(210(j) projects). Section 8(d) of ECPA requires the Commission to studywhether PURPA benefits should be available to these facilities. The Commissionwill submit the results of its study to Congress, and Congress will thenhave one full session to consider the issue. The moratorium on PURPA benefitswill end at the expiration of the first full session in which the Commissionsubmits its report to Congress. Under PURPA section 210(j), PURPA benefits will not be available to hydroelectricprojects located at new dams or diversions unless the project meets eachof the following requirements: (1) <T3>No Substantial Adverse Effects. </T3>At the time of issuance of thelicense or exemption for the project, the Commission finds that the projectwill not have substantial adverse effects on the environment, includingrecreation and water quality. Such finding shall be made by the Commissionafter taking into consideration terms and conditions imposed under eitherparagraph (3) of this subsection or section 10 of the Federal Power Act(whichever is appropriate as required by that Act or the Electric ConsumersProtection Act of 1986) and compliance with other environmental requirementsapplicable to the project. (2) <T3>Protected Rivers. </T3>At the time application for a license or exemptionfor the project is accepted by the Commission (in accordance with the Commission'sregulations and procedures in effect on January 1, 1986, including thoserelating to environmental consultation), such project is not located oneither of the following: (A) Any segment of a natural watercourse which is included in (or designatedfor potential inclusion in) a State or national wild and scenic river system.(B) Any segment of a natural watercourse which the State has determined,in accordance with applicable State law, to possess unique natural, recreational,cultural, or scenic attributes which would be adversely affected by hydroelectricdevelopment. (3) <T3>Fish and Wildlife Terms and Conditions. </T3>The project meets theterms and conditions set by fish and wildlife agencies under the same proceduresas provided for under section 30(c) of the Federal Power Act. While section 8 of ECPA establishes three new requirements for PURPA benefits,it also creates four exceptions to the new requirements and to the moratorium.Any project which qualifies for one of the exceptions may seek PURPA benefitswithout complying with one or more of the new requirements. Any projectthat qualifies for one of the exceptions is also exempted from the moratorium.\7\<NOTE/>  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\ The result of this framework is that the new requirementscan have immediate application even though there is a moratorium on PURPAbenefits. For example, one of the exceptions only excepts a project fromone of the new requirements. Such a project would be exempt from the moratoriumand would be able to seek PURPA benefits. However, the project still wouldhave to comply with remaining requirements in section 210(j) of PURPA.The first exception to these new requirements is embodied in section 210(j)of PURPA itself. This exception applies to any new dam or diversion projectthat is located at a government dam where non-Federal hydroelectric developmentis permissible (government dam exception). Any project in this categoryis exempted from the moratorium and may seek PURPA benefits without complyingwith any of the new requirements.\8\<NOTE/> The remaining exceptions, in section 8(b) of ECPA, providerelief to developers who had relied on existing law and had expended asignificant amount of money and effort on their projects at the time ofECPA's enactment. The remaining exceptions in section 8(b) of ECPA are:<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\8\ This ``exception'', unlike the exceptions in section 8(b)of ECPA, is a categorical exception and is not keyed to the timing of anyevent. By definition section 210(j) does not apply to new dams or diversionsthat are located at government dams where non-Federal hydroelectric developmentis permissible. 1. None of the three new requirements applies if the application was filed,and accepted for filing by the Commission, before October 16, 1986, thedate of ECPA's enactment (section 8(b)(2) of ECPA). 2. Only the protected rivers requirement (section 210(j)(2) of PURPA appliesif the application was filed before October 16, 1986, and accepted forfiling by the Commission between October 16, 1986, and October 16, 1989(section 8(b)(3) of ECPA).\9\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\ For projects that qualify for this exception, the Commissionis contacting the appropriate state agencies and requesting that the agenciesdetermine if such projects are located on any natural watercourse as describedin section 210(j)(2) of PURPA.3. The fish and wildlife agency requirement (section 210(j)(3) of PURPA)does not apply if the application was filed after October 16, 1986, andif the Commission finds, based on a petition filed by the applicant within18 months from October 16, 1986, that the applicant had (prior to ECPA'senactment) committed substantial monetary resources to development of theproject and to the diligent and timely completion of all filing requirementsof the Commission (section 8(b)(4) of ECPA).The exception in section 8(b)(4) only excepts an applicant from the termsand conditions of fish and wildlife agencies under section 210(j)(3) ofPURPA; it does not exempt the applicant from the terms and conditions setby fish and wildlife agencies under section 10(j) or 30(c) of the FPA.\1\\0\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\0\ If an applicant qualifies for the exception from thefish and wildlife agency requirement is section 210(j)(3) of PURPA, theapplicant is still subject to either recommended terms and conditions setby fish and wildlife agencies under section 10(j) of the FPA or mandatoryterms and conditions set by fish and wildlife agencies under section 30(c)of the FPA. Congress intended FPA section 10(j) to apply to all applicationsfor licenses except for those applications covered by PURPA section 210(j)(3).The Conference report which accompanies ECPA states: ``Section 10 of theFederal Power Act, as amended by [ECPA], shall apply to all projects ** * for which a license is issued * * * except that section 10(j) willnot apply if section 210(j)(3) of PURPA * * * applies to the project.''H.R. Rep. No. 934, 99th Cong., 2nd Sess. 32 (1986).<ITAG tagnum="28">Congress also did not intend to alter the application of section 30(c)of the FPA. Section 8(c) of ECPA requires that, ``Nothing in this Act (ECPA)shall affect the application of section 30(c) of the Federal Power Actto any </ITAG><T3>exemption </T3>issued after the enactment of this Act.'' H.R. Rep.No. 934, 99th Cong., 2nd Sess. 32 (1986) (emphasis added).B. The Commission'sEnvironmental Responsibilities under the FPAAs mentioned above, Congress established three new environmental requirementsthat must be satisfied before certain small power production facilities(<T3>i.e., </T3>hydroelectric projects located at new dams and diversions)can be qualifying facilities (QFs) under PURPA. In addition to administeringthe new environmental requirements in section 210(j) of PURPA, the Commissionhas the responsibility under the FPA to ensure that all hydroelectric projectsare environmentally sound. Accordingly, the Commission's hydroelectriclicensing regulations require the submission of substantial amounts ofenvironmental information, and every hydroelectric project at a new damor diversion must comply with these regulations \1\\1\<NOTE/> regardless of whether PURPA benefits are sought.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\1\ <T3>See</T3> 18 CFR Part 4 (1987).The Commission licenses hydroelectric projects pursuant to section 4(e)of the Federal Power Act (FPA).\1\\2\<NOTE/> In order to issue a license, the Commission must find undersection 10(a) of the FPA that the project ``will be best adapted to a comprehensiveplan for improving or developing a waterway * * *.'' \1\\3\<NOTE/> The courts interpret this standard to require considerationof the environmental consequences of any proposed project. In <T3>FPC v. Idaho Power Company,</T3>\1\\4\<NOTE/> the Supreme Court observed that the Commission is plainlymade the guardian of the public domain under section 10(a) of the FPA.\1\\5\<NOTE/> in <T3>Udall v.

The Commission's current regulations require submissionof substantial amounts of environmental information so that the Commissioncan fulfill its duties under the FPA. The Commission intends that everyapplicant with a hydroelectric project at a new dam or diversion seekingPURPA benefits full comply with its hydroelectric licensing regulations.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\8\ Scenic Hudson Preservation Conference v. FPC, 354 F.2d608, 614 (2nd Cir. 1965), <T3>cert. denied, </T3>384 U.S. 941 (1966).C. The Interim Rule and Section(8)(b)(4) of ECPAThe Commission issued an interim rule on February 13, 1987, that implementedportions of section 8 ECPA.\1\\9\<NOTE/> The interim rule was necessary because of a provision insection 8(b)(4) of ECPA. Section 8(b)(4)(A) allows an applicant to be exceptedfrom the fish and wildlife agency requirement in section 210(j)(3) of PURPAif, based on a petition, the applicant can demonstrate a commitment ofsubstantial monetary resources to the project prior to ECPA's enactment.Section 8(b)(4)(A) required the Commission to issue a rule within 120 daysfrom ECPA's enactment promulgating regulations to govern the petition todemonstrate a commitment of substantial monetary resources (CSMR petition).Section 8(b)(4)(B) provides that if an applicant had a preliminary permitand had completed environmental consultations prior to ECPA's enactment,there is a rebuttable presumption that the applicant had committed substantialmonetary resources to the project.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\9\ <T3>Supra </T3>note 3.Section 8(b)(4)(C) provides that any applicant who has filed a CSMR petitionunder section 8(b)(4)(A) may file a second petition and receive a preliminarydetermination on whether the project statisfies section 210(j)(1) of PURPA,which requires that the project not have a substantial adverse effect onthe environment. Section 8(b)(4)(C) provides further that if the Commissioninitially finds that the project will have a substantial adverse effect,the Commission must give the applicant a reasonable opportunity to providefor mitigation of such adverse effects before making a final determination.Finally, section 8(b)(4)(C) provides that if the Commission has notifiedthe State of its initial finding and the State has not taken any actionunder the protected rivers requirement (section 210(j)(2) of PURPA), thefailure to take such action will be the basis for a rebuttable presumptionthat there is not a substantial adverse effect on the environment relatedto natural, recreational, cultural, or scenic attributes.The interim rule defined ``commitment of substantial monetary resources''(CSMR) and provided procedures for the filing and processing of a CSMRpetition. Applicants had from March 23, 1987 (the effective date of theinterim rule) until April 16, 1988 to file a CSMR petition. Three CSMRpetitions have been filed with the Commission.\20\<NOTE/> In addition to implementing sections 8(b)(4)(A) and 8(b)(4)(B)of ECPA, the Commission implemented (on an interim basis) the remainingexceptions in section 8 of ECPA and the new requirements of section 210(j)of PURPA. The Commission did not implement the provisions of section 8(b)(4)(C)of ECPA in the interim rule; rather, the Commission proposed regulationsto implement section 8(b)(4)(C) in a notice of proposed rulemaking thatis discussed below. The Commission, in issuing this final rule, revokesthe interim rule and terminates Docket No. RM87-8-000. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\20\City of Harrisburg, applicant for the Dock Sheet Project_ProjectNo. 10418-000 (Pennsylvania), filed a CSMR petition on August 5, 1987;Beaver Creek Hydro, Inc. applicant for the Beaver Creek Project_ProjectNo. 7853-003 (Idaho), filed a CSMR petition on September 29, 1987; andReeds Creek Hydro, Inc., applicant for the Reeds Creek Project_ProjectNo. 10490-000 (Idaho), filed a CSMR petition on October 1, 1987. However,the license applications for the Beaver Creek Project and the Reeds CreekProject have been dismissed by the Commission. D. The Notice of ProposedRulemaking On October 5, 1987, the Commission issued a notice of proposed rulemaking(NOPR) in order to implement remaining portions of section 8 of ECPA.\21\<NOTE/> In the NOPR, the Commission proposed filing requirementsthat would allow the Commission to enforce the new requirements in section210(j) of PURPA. The Commission also proposed to define ``substantial adverseeffect on the environment'' for the purposes of section 210(j)(1) of PURPA.In addition, the Commission proposed to implement that portion of the exceptionin section 8(b)(4) of ECPA which was not addressed in the interim rule(<T3>i.e., </T3>section 8(b)(4)(C)). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\21\Implementation of Section 8 of the Electric ConsumersProtection Act of 1986; Hydroelectric Applicants with New Dam or DiversionProjects, 52 FR 38460 (Oct. 16, 1987), FERC Stats. andamp; Regs.

Discussion </ITAG>In this final rule, the Commission implements section 8 of ECPA by amendingPart 4, Part 292, and Part 375 of its regulations. The Commission mergesthe regulations in the interim rule and the regulations proposed in theNOPR into one set of comprehensive regulations governing the requirementsof section 210(j) of PURPA. In addition, the Commission makes changes inthe regulations in response to the suggestions of commenters. An overviewof the regulatory changes is provided below. As adopted, the rule: andbullet; Sets out the provisions of section 210(j) of PURPA and establishesfiling requirements to ensure that the Commission has the information itneeds to make the required findings. This information includes filing anenvironmental report that conforms to andSection;4.41(f) of the Commission'sregulations; andbullet; Requires all applicants to state (during the initial stage ofpre-filing consultation under andSection;4.38 of the Commission's regulations)whether or not the applicant intends to seek PURPA benefits and whetherthe project is located at a new dam or diversion; andbullet; Prohibits applicants who have stated they will not seek PURPAbenefits from reversing their statement of intent after the license orexemption has been issued by the Commission. andbullet; Requires all applicants with a hydroelectric power project locatedat a new dam or diversion that seek PURPA benefits to perform the environmentalstudies in andSection;4.38(b)(2)(i)(D)-(F) of the Commission's regulations.andbullet; Revises the definitions of ``substantial adverse effect of theenvironment''; and andbullet; Revises the regulations implementing the exceptions containedin section 8(b)(4)(C) of ECPA.A. Public Reporting BurdenExcept for the specific information collection burdens discussed below,this rule does not substantially change existing Commission regulationsfor hydroelectric license or exemption applicants. Section 8 of ECPA attachesnew significance to the status of a project as either an ``existing dam''or a ``new dam or diversion'' for the purposes of obtaining PURPA benefits.Consequently, new andSection; 4.38(b)(1)(vi)(A) requires every applicantto state whether or not it intends to seek PURPA benefits. If the applicantintends to seek PURPA benefits it must also state whether the dam is anexisting dam or a new dam or diversion.\2\\3\<NOTE/> The information collection requirement of stating whetheror not the applicant intends to seek PURPA benefits represents a minimalburden that is estimated to be 5 minutes per response. This requirementwill affect all hydroelectric applicants with projects that have a capacityof 80 MW or less and the number of these respondents is estimated to be76 (per year).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\3\ <T3>See,</T3> new andSection; 4.38(b)(1)(vi)(B).Section of ECPA imposed a moratorium on PURPA benefits. However, as notedearlier, any project that qualifies for one of the statutory exceptionsis exempted from the moratorium. Consequently, except for the new requirementin andSection; 4.38(b)(1)(vi)(A) discussed above, the information collectionburdens imposed by this rule only apply to applicants that can qualifyfor one of the exceptions in section 8 of ECPA.For an applicant that qualifies for the exception in section 8(b)(3) ofECPA, the information collection burden is estimated to be 16 hours perresponse. The number of likely respondents is 7. For an applicant thatqualifies for the exception in section 8(b)(4) of ECPA, the informationcollection burden is estimated to be 40 hours per response. The numberof likely respondents is 1. Two of the exceptions in section 8 of ECPAexcept applicants from all of the requirements in section 210(j) of PURPA.Therefore, there is no information collection burden for such applicants.Send comments regarding the burden estimate or any other aspect of thiscollection of information, including suggestions for reducing this burden,to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street NE.,Washington, DC 20426 (Attention: Marian Obis, (202) 357-8173); and to theOffice of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management andBudget, Washington, DC 20503. [Attention: Desk Officer for the FederalEnergy Regulatory Commission.]B. Implementation of Section 210(j) of PURPAThe Commission will make the findings required by section 210(j) of PURPAwithin the context of its current environmental review process. Any projectwithin the guidelines of section 210(j) of PURPA is subject to specificenvironmental findings. The Commission, therefore, amends its regulationsto require that all projects within the purview of section 210(j) be subjectto specific filing requirements under Part 4 and Part 292 of its regulations.Many commenters in this rulemaking proceeding express a general concernwhether the proposed regulations would ensure that the Commission wouldreceive the information needed to make the findings under section 210(j)of PURPA. These commenters apparently believe that the proposed regulationsimplementing section 210(j) would subject projects to less environmentalscrutiny than would otherwise be the case if PURPA benefits were not beingsought. This idea is incorrect and misinterprets the relationship betweenthe Commission's regulations implementing section 210(j) of PURPA and theCommission's hydroelectric licensing regulations under the FPA. As notedearlier, the Commission is already charged with the duty under the FPAto ensure that hydroelectric projects are environmentally sound. The regulationsimplementing section 210(j) of PURPA do not take the place of, but arein addition to, the Commission's hydroelectric licensing regulations. TheCommission intends that every applicant with a hydroelectric project locatedat a new dam or diversion who seeks PURPA benefits satisfy all the applicablerequirements in Part 4 of the Commission's regulations, as well as theenvironmental requirements of section 210(j) of PURPA.<ITAG tagnum="81">Prefiling Consultation Requirements  </ITAG>The Commission's hydroelectric licensing regulations contain general conditionsfor all hydroelectric license or exemption application.\24\<NOTE/>These general conditions include prefiling consultation requirementscontained in andSection;4.38 of the Commission's regulations. Section 4.38requires applicants to consult with each appropriate Federal and stateagency before submitting its application to the Commission, and the consultationis broken down into three stages. The initial stage of consultation requiresthe applicant to provide each appropriate agency with detailed informationregarding the project. Information required in the initial stage includesthe identification of the environment to be affected, the significant resourcespresent, and any environmental protection, mitigation, or enhancement plans.\25\<NOTE/>  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\24\<T3>See </T3>18 CFR 4.30-4.39 (1987).  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\25\18 CFR 4.38(b)(1)(iv) (1987).  The second stage of consultation requires the applicant to conduct anystudies that are necessary for the Commission to make an informed decisionregarding the merits of the application. Studies must be conducted if theresults are needed to determine the impact of the project on importantnatural or cultural resources, or are necessary to determine suitable mitigation,or are necessary to minimize impacts to a significant resource (<T3>e.g, </T3>wild and scenic river, anadromous fish, endangered species,caribou migration routes).\26\<NOTE/>  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\26\18 CFR 4.38(b)(2)(i)(D)-(F) (1987).  The third stage of prefiling consultation occurs when the applicant filesits application for a license or exemption. The applicant must serve acopy of the application on each agency it has consulted and must documentin Exhibit E of its application that all three stages of the consultationprocess have been fully satisfied.\27\<NOTE/>In order to comply with ECPA and section 210(j) of PURPA,the Commission amends andSection;4.38 of its regulations concerning prefilingconsultation requirements.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\27\18 CFR 4.38(b)(3) (1987). In addition, andSection;4.38(b)(3)requires the applicant to include in Exhibit E a copy of the water qualitycertification under section 401 of the Water Pollution Control Act (CleanWater Act) and any agency letters containing comments, recommendations,or proposed terms and conditions.  (i) <T3>Statement of intent to seek PURPA benefits; verification of new damor diversion.</T3> Prior to ECPA, there was no distinction between newdams and diversions and existing dams for the purpose of obtaining PURPAbenefits. ECPA introduced this distinction, imposing three new environmentalrequirements on projects located on new dams or diversions. Therefore,in order to comply with ECPA, the Commission must verify whether or nota project is located at a new dam or diversion. In the NOPR, the Commissionproposed that every applicant for a project with a power capacity of 80megawatts (MW) or less state in its application whether or not PURPA benefitswill be sought, and if so, whether the project is located at a new damor diversion.  All commenters were in favor of this requirement and agree with the Commission'sgoal of preventing an applicant from deliberately circumventing the requirementsof section 210(j) by initially indicating an intent not to seek PURPA benefitsand then at some point in the future seeking PURPA benefits as a projectlocated at an ``existing dam.'' The New York State Department of EnvironmentalConservation (NYDEC), while in favor of the requirement, also suggeststhat an applicant be required to state its intention to seek PURPA benefitsat the time prefiling consultation begins under andSection;4.38 of the Commission'sregulations.\28\<NOTE/>  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\28\Comments of NYDEC, at p. 1.

Rep. No. 934, 99th Cong., 2d Sess. 30 (1986).(ii) <T3>Reversal of statement of intent not to seek PURPA benefits. </T3>Inthe NOPR, the Commission proposed that if, prior to the issuance of a licenseor exemption, an applicant filed a statement reversing its intent not toseek PURPA benefits, the Commission would treat the statement as a materialamendment to the application. Treating a reversal of intent in this mannerwould also change the acceptance data of the application to the date onwhich the amendment was filed. The Commission would then consider the amendedapplication a new filed for the following purposes:(1) Reissuing public notice of the application (andSection; 4.32 of the Commission'sregulations_Acceptance for filing or rejection) 18 CFR 4.32 (1987).(2) Timeliness (andSection; 4.36 of the Commission's regulations_Competingapplications) 18 CFR 4.36 (1987), and(3) Disposal of competing applications (andSection; 4.37 of the Commission'sregulations_Rules of preference among competing applications) 18 CFR 4.37(1987).In addition, the Commission proposed to rescind any acceptance letter forthe application which may have been issued. As a consequence, the applicantwould be subject to a new notice period and might lose priority among competingapplicants.The New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (NYDEC) suggeststhat applicants should not be given the opportunity to seek PURPA benefitsafter the initial stage of consultation.\3\\1\<NOTE/> The Commission disagrees with NYDEC and will allow an applicantto reverse its statement of intent up until the time the license or exemptionis issued. However, the Commission believes that the pre-filing consultationprocess under andSection; 4.38 of its regulations is important for gatheringthe information necessary to comply with section 8 of ECPA. Accordingly,if an applicant were to reverse its statement of intent not to seek PURPAbenefits prior to the issuance of a license or exemption, the Commissionwill require the applicant to repeat the consultation process under andSection;4.38 of its regulations.\3\\2\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\\1\ Comments of NYDEC at p. 2.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\\2\ <T3>See </T3>new andSection; 4.32 (c)(2)(i)(A).The Commission also requested comments in the NOPR on whether it should,after the issuance of a license or exemption, prohibit an applicant fromseeking PURPA benefits if the applicant reverses its statement of intentnot to seek PURPA benefits. The National Wildlife Federation (NWF) believesthe regulations should explicitly prohibit an applicant from initiallystating that it will not seek PURPA benefits and later obtaining such benefitsat the same site.\3\\3\<NOTE/> The Commission agrees with the NWF and adopts a regulationthat prohibits applicants from seeking PURPA benefits after a license orexemption has been issued.\3\\4\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\\3\ Comments of NWF at p. 3.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\\4\ <T3>See </T3>new andSection; 4.32(c)(2)(ii).

The Commission anticipates that environmentalstudies are likely to be required under andSection; 4.38 (b)(2)(i)(D)-(F)of its regulations for the Commission to make the required findings undersection 210(j) of PURPA. Therefore, the Commission references the environmentalstudies that may be required under Part 4 of its regulations in new andSection;292.208(c)(1)(i) of its regulations.\3\\5\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\\5\ <T3>See </T3>new andSection; 292.208(c)(1)(i).<ITAG tagnum="81">2.

Definition of New Dam or Diversion </ITAG>Section 210(k) of PURPA defines new dam or diversion as a ``dam or diversionwhich requires, for purposes of installing any hydroelectric power project,any construction, or enlargement of any impoundment or diversion structure(other than repairs or reconstruction or the addition of flashboards orsimilar adjustable devices).'' The proposed definition of new dam or diversionin the NOPR tracked the statutory definition of new dam or diversion insection 210(k) of PURPA. In its comments on the NOPR, the Oregon Department of Energy (ODE) objectsto the proposed definition based on its interpretation of the words ``anyconstruction'' to include construction unrelated to the impoundment ordiversion structure.\42\<NOTE/> In fact, the Commission and ODE agree that it is the constructionor enlargement of the impoundment or diversion structure which makes astructure a ``new dam or diversion.'' To interpret the words ``any construction''to include construction unrelated to the impoundment or diversion structureis unreasonable and would lead to irrational results.\43\<NOTE/> In addition, such an interpretation would conflict with thecurrent definition of ``existing dam'' in the Commission's regulations.The Commission uses the same concept of ``construction or enlargement ofimpoundment structures'' to determine whether a structure is an existingdam.\44\<NOTE/> The Commission believes it is axiomatic that the words ``anyconstruction'' in section 210(k) of PURPA refer to construction relatingto the impoundment or diversion structure. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\42\ Comments of ODE at p. 1. ODE's interpretation is basedon the placement of the comma which sets off the words ``any construction''from the rest of the proposed definition of new dam or diversion, (andthe absence of a comma after the word ``enlargement''). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\43\ Such an interpretation would mean that any constructionat an existing dam, including construction unrelated to the impoundmentor diversion structure, would make the dam a ``new dam or diversion.''<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\44\ ``Existing dam * * * means any dam * * * which does notrequire any construction or enlargement of impoundment structures * * *.''18 CFR 4.30(b)(6)(i), (ii) (1987). (i) <T3>Flashboards. </T3>Under the definition of a new dam or diversion insection 210(k) of PURPA, the addition of flashboards does not precludea project from seeking PURPA benefits as an existing dam.\45\<NOTE/> In contrast, the addition of flashboards or similar adjustabledevices may preclude a project from qualifying for an exemption as an existingdam under the FPA. Section 4.30(b)(6)(ii) of the Commission's regulationsdefines an existing dam for exemption purposes as ``any dam, the constructionof which was completed on or before April 20, 1977, and which does notrequire any construction or enlargement of impoundment structures (otherthan repairs or reconstruction) in connection with the installation ofany small hydroelectric power project.'' \46\<NOTE/> The Commission has stated that whether a dam is an ``existingdam'' is an issue of fact, suited for a case-specific determination.\47\<NOTE/> One factor the Commission reviews in determining whetheran exemption project is an existing dam is whether there has been a significantchange in the original impoundment.\48\<NOTE/> Consequently, whether or not an exemption project can qualifyas an existing dam may turn on the question of whether the project historicallyused flashboards as a part of the original impoundment.\49\<NOTE/> The Commission will continue to examine the historical useof flashboards for exemption projects. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\45\ Section 210(k) of PURPA provides that ``the term newdam or diversion means a dam or diversion which requires, for proposingof installing any hydroelectric power project, any construction, or enlargementof any impoundment or diversion structure (<T3>other than repairs or reconstruction or the addition of flashboardsor similar adjustable devices</T3>)'' (emphasis added). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\46\ 18 CFR 4.30(6)(ii) (1987). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\47\ <T3>See </T3>Winchester Water Control District, 24 FERC andpara; 61,287 (1983),<T3>aff'd in pertinent part, </T3>Steamboaters v.

Requiring an applicantto provide this information during pre-filing consultation ensures thatthe Commission will have the views of the appropriate Federal and stateagencies on the issue of whether the project qualifies as a new dam ordiversion under section 210(k) of PURPA. Interested persons will also havethe opportunity to comment on whether the project is a new dam or diversionor an existing dam.

The NWF and AR object to certain aspects of the proposed definition.\53\<NOTE/> NWF suggests that the definition of ``substantial adverseeffect'' should be set out in a separate regulatory section governing thefindings the Commission must make under section 210(j) of PURPA. The Commissionconcurs with NWF and has restructured its regulations implementing section210(j) of PURPA.\54\<NOTE/> The definition of ``substantial adverse effect on the environment''is added to andSection; 292.202 of the Commission's regulations, which containsall the definitions for Part 292, Subpart B of the Commission's regulations.\55\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\53\ Comments of NWF at pp. 3-4; Comments of AR at pp. 6-7.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\54\ <T3>See </T3>new andSection; 292.203(c), and andSection;andSection; 292.208-292.211.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\55\ <T3>See</T3> new andSection; 292.202(q) (1987).The NWF and AR also object to the language ``a change in the resource whichresults in a modification of the continued use of that resources.''\56\<NOTE/> Both commenters believe that the definition does not takeinto account a substantial adverse effect on an anticipated future useof a resource (<T3>e.g., </T3>planned restoration or resource recovery projects). AR alsointerprets the language to exclude changes in the quality of an affectedresource. Specifically, AR believes that a substantial adverse effect cantake place without a modification in the use of the resource.\57\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\56\ Comments of NWF at p. 4; Comments of AR pp. 6-7. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\57\ Comments of AR at p. 7. As an example, AR states thata river could still be used for recreational whitewater rafting after theconstruction of a hydroelectirc project, but the quality of that recreationalexperience could be significantly diminished. The Commission intends the definition of a substantial adverse effect onthe environment to include adverse effects that would diminish the qualityof a resource. Consequently, the Commission amends its definition of substantialadverse effect on the environment to read as follows:<ITAG tagnum="21">Substantial adverse effect on the environment means a substantialalteration in the existing or potential use of, or a loss of, natural features,existing habitat, recreational uses, water quality or other environmentalresources. Substantial alteration of a particular resource includes a changein the environment that substantially reduces the quality of the affectedresource.\58\<NOTE/> </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\58\ In response to NWF's and AR's concern regarding restorationor resource recovery projects, the Commission notes that it will considerthe impact of the project on a restoration or resource recovery projectas part of the record on which the Commission makes its determination onthe merits of the application. C. Section 8(b)(4) of ECPASection 8(b)(4) of ECPA excepts an applicant from the fish and wildlifeagency requirement in section 210(j)(3) of PURPA, if the applicant candemonstrate a commitment of substantial monetary resources to the developmentof the project prior to October 16, 1986. In the interim rule, the Commissiondefined a ``commitment of substantial monetary resources'' as the expenditureof, or commitment to expand, at least 50 percent of the total cost of preparingan application for a license or exemption that is accepted for filing bythe Commission. The total cost includes [but is not limited to] the costof agency consultation, environmental studies, and engineering studiesconducted under Part 4 of the Commission's regulations. The Montana Department of Fish, Wildlife andamp; Parks (Montana) expressesconcern ``that an applicant is very likely to expend at least 50 percentof its funds on agency consultation and engineering studies before doingany environmental studies, and could, therefore, be exempt from conductingany environmental studies.''\59\<NOTE/> The Commission disagrees with Montana's conclusion. Whileit is technically possible for an applicant to spend 50 percent of itsfunds on agency consultation and engineering studies before doing any environmentalstudies, an applicant would never be exempt from conducting any environmentalstudies under the Commission's regulations. The second state of pre-filingconsultation in andSection; 4.38 of the Commission regulation's requiresan applicant to perform any reasonable studies necessary for the Commissionto make an informed decision regarding the merits of the application.\60\<NOTE/> Section 4.38(b)(2) requires environmental studies if theresults are: (1) Needed to determine the impacts of the project on importantnatural or cultural resources, (2) necessary to determine suitable mitigation,or (3) necessary to minimize impacts to a significant resource (<T3>e.g., </T3>wild and scenic river, anadromous fish, endangered species,caribou migration routes). The Commission believes it is highly unlikelythat such environmental studies would not be required for an applicantwith a project located at a new dam or diversion seeking PURPA benefits.\61\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\59\ Comments of Montana at p. 1. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\60\ <T3>See </T3>18 CFR 4.38(b)(2) (1987). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\61\ The Commission specifically references these studiesin its new filing requirements. <T3>See </T3>new andSection; 292.208(c)(1)(i).<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Rebuttable Presumption in Section 8(b)(4)(B) of ECPA</ITAG>Section 8(b)(4)(B) of ECPA provides that any applicant who filed a commitmentof substantial monetary resources petition (CSMR petition) and who hada preliminary permit and had completed environmental consultations priorto October 16, 1986, can benefit from a rebuttable presumption that theapplicant had committed substantial monetary resources to the project.In the interim rule, the Commission provided that such an applicant couldsimply file a statement identifying the preliminary permit by project numberinstead of submitting more detailed information. American, <T3>et al. </T3>objects to this regulation and requests that the applicantnot be relieved of the obligation to file detailed cost information.\62\<NOTE/> American, <T3>et al. </T3>argues these data are necessary to rebut the presumption.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\62\ Comments of American, <T3>et al. </T3>on the interim rule (RM87-8-000) at p. 3.In the Commission's view, the fact that an applicant has a preliminarypermit and has completed environmental consultations indicates a sufficientcommitment of substantial monetary resources to allow the presumption insection 8(b)(4)(B) to arise. Consequently, the Commission does not requiresuch applicants to file detailed information to demonstrate that they havecommittted substantial monetary resources. However, the Commission is amendingits regulations to provide that if any interested person objects to thepresumption, the applicant must provide the cost information in andSection;andSection;292.210(d)(3)-(5). Interested persons have ample information on which tobase an objection to the presumption. Since the applicant will have completedprefiling consultation, its application will be on file with the Commission.\63\<NOTE/> In addition, the application for the preliminary permit willalso be on file with the Commission. Any interested party can review bothof these applications. If an objection is made, the applicant must providethe cost information in andSection;andSection; 292.210(d)(3)-(5).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\63\ <T3>See, </T3>18 CFR 4.38(b)(3) (1987).<ITAG tagnum="84">2. Section 8(b)(4)(C) of ECPA</ITAG>Section 8(b)(4)(C) of ECPA provides that an applicant who filed a successfulCSMR petition may file an adverse environmental effects (AEE) petitionasking for an initial determination that the project will not have substantialadverse effects on the environment as specified in PURPA section 210(j)(1).\64\<NOTE/> The AEE petition can be filed any time before the licenseor exemption is issued by the Commission. If the Commission initially decidesthat the project will have a substantial adverse effect, it must affordthe applicant a reasonable opportunity to provide for mitigation of thoseadverse effects before making a final determination. If the Commissioninitially decides that the project will not have a substantial adverseeffect, it will afford states and interested persons a reasonable opportunityto comment on whether the project satisfies section 210(j)(1) before makinga final determination.\65\<NOTE/> ECPA also provides that if a State has not taken any of theactions described in section 210(j)(2) of PURPA between the time of theCommission's initial and final determination on the AEE petition, a rebuttablepresumption arises that there is not a substantial adverse effect relatedto the natural, recreational, cultural or scenic attributes of the environment.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\64\ The provisions of section 8(b)(4)(C) of ECPA are onlyavailable to those applicants who have filed a successful CSMR petition,<T3>see </T3>new andSection; 292.211(a) and (c).

Through April 16, 1988, three applicantshave filed CSMR petitions; <T3>see </T3>applicants cited <T3>supra </T3>note 20. These applicants are the only applicants who may(if their CSMR petitions are granted) receive a determination on any AEEpetition filed with the Commission.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\65\ Section 8(b)(4)(C) of ECPA requires the Commission tomake a final determination on the AEE petition at the time the licenseor exemption is issued.In the NOPR, the Commission proposed that the AEE petition identify theproject and request that the Commission make an initial determination onwhether the project satisfies section 210(j)(1) of PURPA. Eastern ProfessionalRiver Outfitters (EPRO) and American Whitewater Affiliation (AWA) arguethis requirement is inadequate.\66\<NOTE/> EPRO and AWA are apparently under the misapprehension thatthis information in the AEE petition would be the only information theCommission would require in order to make the section 210(j)(1) findingof substantial adverse effects.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\66\ Comments of EPRO at p. 2; comments of AWA at p. 7.This perception misinterprets the relationship between the exception insection 8(b)(4)(C) of ECPA and section 210(j)(1) of PURPA. The Commissionhas an absolute obligation under section 210(j)(1) of PURPA, independentof the exception in section 8(b)(4)(C), to ensure that a hydroelectricproject at a new dam or diversion does not have a substantial adverse effecton the environment. The filing of the AEE petition is a voluntary decisionby the applicant. Therefore, regardless of whether the applicant filesan AEE petition, the Commission must have the information it needs to makethe finding under section 210(j)(1) of PURPA. To ensure that it receivesthe necessary information the Commission establishes new filing requirementsin andSection; 292.208(c).

Rebuttable Presumption</ITAG>Section 8(b)(4)(C) provides that if, between the time of the Commission'sinitial and final findings on the AEE petition, the State has not takenany action under section 210(j)(2) of PURPA, the failure to take such actionshall be the basis for a rebuttable presumption that there is not a substantialadverse effect on the environment related to natural, recreational culturalor scenic attributes.In implementing this section, it is important to note that the rebuttablepresumption applies, if it arises at all, only to certain environmentalattributes. The Commission has an independent obligation to make the section210(j)(1) finding.Several commenters object to the Commission's proposed implementation ofthe rebuttable presumption.\71\<NOTE/> Specifically, these commenters object to (1) the timing ofthe presumption, (2) the evidence required to rebut the presumption, and(3) any limitations as to who may rebut the presumption.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\71\ <T3>See </T3>comments of AR at pp. 2-6; AWA at pp.4-6; California SaveOur Streams Council at p. 2; Class VI River Runners at pp. 1-2; EasternProfessional River Outfitters at pp. 2-3; NWF at pp. 5-6; NYDEC at p. 3;and Pocono Whitewater at p. 1.The Commission originally proposed that in order to rebut the presumptiona State had to show that it has already protected the watercourse at thetime the license was accepted.\72\<NOTE/> This proposal was based on the fact that section 210(j)(2)of PURPA applies at the time the application for a license or exemptionis accepted by the Commission. AR and NWF suggest that Congress intendedthe presumption to operate between the Commission's initial and final findingon the AEE petition, and that, accordingly, a State may prevent the presumptionfrom arising if it protects the watercourse at any time before the Commissionmakes its final finding on the AEE petition.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\72\ <T3>See </T3>proposed andSection; 292.210(i), 52 FR at 38,466, FERC Stats.andamp; Regs. [Proposed Regulations 1982-1987] andpara; 32,453 at 33,655.In addition, NWF criticized the proposed regulation because it would requirethe State to come forward with evidence that it had protected the watercourse.While NWF believes the State should be free to make such a showing, italso believes the Commission has a duty to make a reasonable inquiry intothe status of the watercourse under State law, and that other persons shouldbe able to present evidence that the watercourse is protected under Statelaw.Finally, several commenters were concerned about who would be able to rebutthe presumption. AWA, AR and NWF interpret the proposed regulation as onlygiving the State the opportunity to rebut the presumption. These commentersall argue that any interested person should be able to rebut the presumption.The Commission adopts certain commenters' suggestions concerning the rebuttablepresumption in section 8(b)(4)(C) of ECPA. The Commission also notes thatit is helpful to distinguish between how the presumption arises and whocan rebut the presumption once it has arisen. The Commission intends thatthe presumption can be prevented from arising if the State, the Commissionor an interested person demonstrates that the State has acted to protectthe natural watercourse under section 210(j)(2) of PURPA. In contrast,if the State has failed to take any action under section 210(j)(2) of PURPA,the presumption takes effect and the question becomes how can the presumptionbe rebutted. In this case, the Commission intends that any interested person(including the State or the Commission) can present evidence to show thatthe project will have a substantial adverse effect on the natural, recreational,cultural or scenic attributes of the environment. In either case the Commissionstill must make a finding of no substantial adverse effect under section210(j)(1) of PURPA.Accordingly, new andSection; 292.211(k) provides that the presumption canoperate between the Commission's initial and final findings on the AEEpetition. In addition, andSection; 292.211(k)(2)(iii) specifically statesthat the presumption has no effect on the Commission's independent (andbroader) obligation to find that the project will not have a substantialadverse effect on the environment under section 210(j)(1) of PURPA. Finally,andSection; 292.211(k)(3) provides that the presumption is prevented fromtaking effect if the State, the Commission or an interested person demonstratesthat the state has acted to protect the natural watercourse under section210(j)(2) of PURPA. In addition andSection; 292.211(k)(4) provides that ifthe presumption is in effect it can be rebutted if: (1) The Commissiondetermines that the project will have an adverse effect on the environmentrelated to the natural, recreational, cultural or scenic attributes ofthe environment or (2) an interested person, including a State, demonstratesthat the project will have a substantial adverse effect on the environmentrelated to the natural, recreational, cultural or scenic attributes ofthe environment. <ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Environmental Statement</ITAG>Commission regulations require that an environmental assessment or an environmentalimpact statement must be prepared for any Commission action that may havea significant adverse effect on the human environment.\73\<NOTE/> The Commission has categorically excluded certain actionsfrom this requirement as not having a significant effect on the human environment.\74\<NOTE/> No environmental consideration is necessary for the promulgationof a rule that is clarifying, corrective, or procedural or that does notsubstantially change the effect of legislation or regulations being amended.\75\<NOTE/> This final rule is procedural in nature. It requires thatcertain information be included with an application. Moreover, the ruledoes not substantially change existing Commission regulations providingfor pre-filing consultation with all appropriate agencies and the contentsof a hydroelectric application. Thus, no environmental assessment or environmentalimpact statement is necessary for the regulations promulgated by this rule.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\73\ Regulations Implementing National Environmental PolicyAct, 52.

Section 8 of ECPA attaches new significance to the statusof a project as either an ``existing dam'' or a ``new dam or diversion''for the purposes of obtaining PURPA benefits. Consequently, new andSection;4.38(b)(1)(vi)(A)requires every applicant to state whether or not it intends to seek PURPAbenefits. If the applicant intends to seek PURPA benefits it must alsostate whether the dam is an existing dam or a new dam or diversion.\80\<NOTE/> The information collection requirement of stating whetheror not the applicant intends to seek PURPA benefits represents a minimalburden that is estimated to be 5 minutes per response. This requirementwill affect all hydroelectric applicants with projects that have a capacityof 80 MW or less and the number of these respondents is estimated to be76 (per year). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\80\<T3>See, </T3>new andSection;4.38(b)(1)(vi)(B). Section 8 of ECPA imposed a moratorium on PURPA benefits. However, as notedearlier, any project that qualifies for one of the statutory exceptionsis exempted from the moratorium. Consequently, except for the new requirementin andSection;4.38(b)(1)(vi)(A) discussed above, the information collectionburdens imposed by this rule only apply to applicants that can qualifyfor one of the exceptions in section 8 of ECPA. For an applicant that qualfiies for the exception in section 8(b)(3) ofECPA, the information collection burden is estimated to be 16 hours perresponse. The number of likely respondents is 7. For an applicant thatqualifies for the exception in section 8(b)(4) of ECPA, the informationcollection burden is estimated to be 40 hours per response. The numberof likely respondents is 1. Two of the exceptions in section 8 of ECPAexcept applicants from all of the requirements in section 210(j) of PURPA.Therefore, there is no information collection burden for such applicants.Interested person can obtain information on the information collectionprovisions by contacting the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426 (Attention: Marian Obis,Office of Information Resources Management (202) 357-8173).
