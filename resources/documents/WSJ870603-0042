The retailer of home-improvement products hasn't identified the suitor, which it described as &quot;active in the leveraged buyout field.&quot; As previously reported, Pay 'N Pak said Monday that it is evaluating a bid under which shareholders would receive for each of their shares $17.50 in cash and 13 1/2% cumulative preferred stock valued at $2.50. The preferred's dividend is payable in stock.    Yesterday, Pay 'N Pak said that the proposal had been amended to increase the preferred stock's payout to 17 1/2%.    Pay 'N Pak is also weighing an offer from Florida investor Paul Bilzerian, who has offered $16.67 in cash and preferred stock valued at $3.33. The payout hasn't been determined on the preferred to be issued as part of Mr. Bilzerian's proposal, although Pay 'N Pak has said it would be set at a level aimed at ensuring that the shares trade publicly at $3.33.    In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, Pay 'N Pak shares closed at $19, up 12.5 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
