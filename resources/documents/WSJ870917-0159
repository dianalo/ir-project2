The report stated that hospitals might need &quot;15 different types of reading devices&quot; to retrieve the information. It needs to be mentioned that doctors' offices and ambulances also will require this number of retrieving devices. In addition, these programs are subject to frequent system failures and do not protect the confidentiality of a patient's medical information.    In a medical emergency when minutes can mean the difference between life and death, voluminous details are unnecessary. Physicians and paramedics can better ensure prompt and proper treatment, and avoid misdiagnosis, with a far simpler system: a wallet-sized medical-emergency card that shows immediately a readable electrocardiogram for comparison and contains vital medical information, including a list of medications, allergies, and the name and phone number of the physician to contact for more detailed information. Medical-emergency cards require no special equipment or phone call, are not computer accessible, but instantly provide vital medical information, enabling medical personnel to proceed with proper medical care. These cards are cheap to purchase, and can be reviewed for accuracy by the patient and easily updated if necessary.    Carrying a medical-emergency card could prevent an unnecessary hospitalization and could contribute positively to medical cost containment.    Barbara Protass   President   The Heart Chart Inc.
