Israel's two rival governing parties, meanwhile, moved towardcompromise on the Egyptian plan. Officials suggested further talkswith Egypt before pursuing a controversial proposal forIsraeli-Palestinian talks.   In the occupied Gaza Strip, masked assailants killed a35-year-old Arab health worker with an ax, claiming he collaboratedwith Israel, Arab reports said. The army said it was investigating.   Sayed Muhsen, who was attacked in a U.N. clinic in Gaza's Rafahdistrict, became the 120th Palestinian slain by fellow Arabs onsuch allegations since the start of the 21-month uprising. He wasthe fifth killed in Rafah this week. The army confirmed the slayingand said police were investigating the circumstances.   Israel Television said PLO chief Yasser Arafat has moved toprevent more attacks on suspected collaborators by dispatching aletter to activists in Gaza this week, urging them to stop slayingfellow Arabs.   The latest underground leaflet, the 46th issued since theuprising began on Dec. 8, 1987, called for ``the continuation ofour intefadeh (uprising) with lots of awareness and alertness.''   The leaflet, issued today, criticized Egypt's President HosniMubarak for proposing a new peace initiative earlier this month``at the same time as the enemy was increasing oppression of ourpeople.''   ``There is no chance we can accept the 10 Egyptian points unlessthey include the obviousness and necessity for PLO participation inthe political process on an equal footing with other parties,'' theleaflet added.   Mubarak's plan does not specifically mention the PLO.   It also criticized the Egyptian plan for failing to specify thatnegotiations lead to formation of a Palestinian state in the WestBank and Gaza Strip _ a main goal of the Palestine LiberationOrganization.   Mubarak's plan supports Israel's proposal to hold elections inthe occupied lands to chose Palestinian delegates for talks withIsrael about an interim solution of self-rule.   The Egyptian plan has been rejected by Prime Minister YitzhakShamir because it demands that Israel accept the U.S.-backedprinciple of trading territory for peace, and allow east JerusalemArabs to vote in the elections.   Shamir and his right-wing Likud bloc also reject Egypt'sproposal to put together a 10-member Palestinian delegation forpreparatory talks with Israel that would include two Palestiniansdeported from the occupied territories.   The idea is a compromise with the PLO, which wants diasporaPalestinians involved in the talks. Shamir claims it would let thePLO into negotiations through the back door.   But the left-leaning Labor Party, Likud's partner in thecoaltion Cabinet, wants Israel to accept both the plan and proposeddelegation as a way to break an impasse in peace efforts.   A showdown has been postponed until Oct. 4, when the Egyptianproposals are scheduled for a formal vote by the decision-makingInner Cabinet.   One idea broached by Labor officials was to circumvent thePalestinian delegation plan by suggesting preliminary talks withthe Egyptians before any negotiations with Palestinians.</TEXT></DOC>
