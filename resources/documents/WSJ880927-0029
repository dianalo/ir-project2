Like any serious event, the presidential debate had to be consumed whole, in a single sitting. It remains to be seen which candidate was better served by the event. We're certain, however, that the voters came out winners. Messrs. Bush and Dukakis both finished Sunday evening as credible candidates. More important, the &quot;no-issues campaign&quot; issue is dead; by the time the debate finished, voters knew they had a clear-cut choice.    At the level of political personality, both men accomplished goals necessary to the successful completion of their campaigns.    Despite months of campaigning, the Governor of Massachusetts -- any Governor -- comes to the electorate as a relatively unknown quantity. Daily TV &quot;sound bites&quot; would frustrate any voter's attempt to see the candidate whole; the net effect may in fact be negative for the lesser-known candidate. In his 90 minutes before the public, Michael Dukakis established himself as a legitimate Democratic candidate for the presidency.    Judging from the headlines and early coverage, Mr. Bush has interred the wimp factor: &quot;combative,&quot; &quot;angry,&quot; &quot;slugging.&quot; There was about as much wimp on that stage as there was in the debate's preliminary card -- a bloody Olympic slugfest between American light-welterweight Todd Foster and Korea's Chun Jin Chul. Mr. Bush also carried forward the politically unconventional theme he created around himself in his New Orleans acceptance speech -- that of a decent, personable and humane candidate. This strategy directly undermines the stiff, arms-length stereotype the conventional wisdom imposes on most Republican candidates. Oddly enough, it's at a personal level that Mr. Dukakis comes off as the village Republican and Mr. Bush as an affable Democrat.    As for all the previous wailing about the lack of issues, what more could anyone want? Capital-gains taxes, the strategic defense initiative, the structure of the U.S. nuclear deterrent, private vs. public health-care programs, the U.S. housing stock, the availability of experimental drug treatments for the dying, agricultural policy, government help vs. self-help for minorities, supporting the Contras vs. abandoning the Contras, commercial relationships with Mikhail Gorbachev's Soviet Union. Surely anyone interested in issues doesn't have to wait for further handouts from the candidates to talk about or write about these matters in depth.    Now that all that is clear, the campaign still contains a fascinating mystery. Mr. Dukakis is obviously a liberal. Mr. Bush is obviously a conservative. Why, then, do both men shrink from acknowledging what they are?    Somehow for candidates not running in Brookline or Beverly Hills, &quot;liberal&quot; has become one of those strands of American politics that dare not speak its name, like &quot;Birchite&quot; or &quot;Southern Democrat.&quot; We don't know that Mr. Dukakis does his campaign or his credibility any favor by denying that his presidency would introduce Great Society II, largely led by a younger generation of Harvard dons. Universal health care? Subsidized housing? Scrapping both the MX missile and the Midgetman? If we are talking about anything here it is a traditional liberal program of domestic spending financed with cuts in defense. In brief, a Dukakis presidency would egg on all the instincts of the current Congress -- using perceived social problems as an excuse to use federal money to appease parochial interests.    At the same time, the Bush campaign's internal tensions and contradictions are beginning to show. Instead of a campaign designed to show that he's the man to stand up to Congress, we have Mr. Bush's super manager, Jim Baker, appearing on TV Sunday morning and proclaiming twice that Mr. Bush's issues are &quot;drugs, child care, environment, ethics, energy&quot; -- which is to say, the tar-baby issues that make up Congress's latest shopping list of spending excuses.    Mr. Bush got this far by running as an acceptable heir to the Reagan presidency, and Mr. Dukakis now emerges as another McGovern-Carter-Mondale-Jim Wright liberal. It's up to Mr. Bush to remind voters that our experience shows you don't solve problems by appeasing bullies abroad and throwing money at social concerns at home. That you solve foreign problems through strength. That economic growth, fueled by letting taxpayers keep as much as possible of what they earn, is the essential ingredient in the solution for domestic problems. The debate established Mr. Dukakis as credible and Mr. Bush as humane, but its big potential effect is smoking out the issues. Mr. Bush needs to remind voters why they've rejected the word &quot;liberal,&quot; and why the word &quot;conservative&quot; has been reborn in popularity. </TEXT></DOC>
