Robertson has said he has to win South Carolina's Republicanprimary Saturday, three days before the Super Tuesday primaries inother mostly Southern states. About 700,000 of South Carolina's 3million people are Southern Baptists, with about 2,000 ministers.   A poll conducted last weekend by The Atlanta Journal and TheAtlanta Constitution showed Robertson with the support of 31percent of the ministers who plan to vote Saturday.
