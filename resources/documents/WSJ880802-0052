The survey of 1,500 plant managers found those who expect continued gains outnumber by 3-to-1 those who are forecasting declines. It said 46% of those polled expect better production and 47% expect new orders to remain strong. Nevertheless, those ratios are down since the second quarter, when 55% of the managers expected better production and 56% forecast better orders.    The plant managers survey, which has been conducted for six quarters, evaluates the outlook for production, orders, demand, prices, and manufacturing and labor costs.    Fewer plant managers expect prices and costs to rise in the third quarter. The survey found that 26% of the managers said they expected higher prices in the third quarter, down from 34% in the second quarter. </TEXT></DOC>
