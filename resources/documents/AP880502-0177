Harris County Democratic Chairman Claude Jones and the localparty agree on one thing: their top priority is electing aDemocratic president this fall. It remains to be seen if they canfind common ground elsewhere.   ``My main goal over the next six months is to ensure HarrisCounty does not go to George Bush,'' Jones said. ``The DemocraticParty needs to pull together a very clear platform as analternative to the Reagan and Bush austerity.''   But Jack Carter, who under new rules will run the party'spolitical operations as its secretary, emphasized that the partywon't deviate from Democratic orthodoxy.   ``The 1988 Democratic platform will set the message we will beelecting candidates upon,'' Carter said. ``We will not not changeour platform to (Jones') goals _ he's going to have to move to us.''   Jones stunned the party leadership by defeating Chairman LarryVeselka by a margin of 51 percent to 49 percent in the March 8election. Pundits said his victory stemmed in part from a game ofnames: ``Jones'' was a more palatable choice for many voters than``Veselka.''   Jones works full time for LaRouche, a perennial,ultra-conservative presidential candidate who has claimed thatBritain's Queen Elizabeth II is involved in drug trafficking andhas urged a quarantine of all AIDS patients.   Three days after the election, the party's 34-member steeringcommittee changed the party bylaws to dilute the incomingchairman's powers.   The 664-member executive committee, comprised of precinctchairmen, unanimously approved the changes April 15. A state judgedenied a request by Jones for a temporary restraining order tothwart that vote.   Harris County, which includes Houston, is the nation'ssecond-biggest election district after Illinois' Cook County, whichincludes Chicago. Harris County will send more delegates to theDemocratic National Convention this summer than 17 entire states.   Party officials say Jones' main duties will be acceptingapplications and certifying candidates for the party's primaries.Texas held its Democratic primary for the presidency and state andlocal offices on March 8, Super Tuesday. The party does not haveanother primary scheduled this year.   Jones said he will work to broaden the party's voter base.   ``I've already initiated a voter-registration drive _ we hadseveral set up around the city (over the weekend),'' Jones said.``I personally signed up 40 new voters, and we have a goal of100,000 new voters by the fall election.''   Jones is to be formally sworn in Tuesday night.</TEXT></DOC>
