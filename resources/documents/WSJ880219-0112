Several models of the ionizers, which are primarily used in industrial plants to remove static and dust from the air and containers, had already been recalled by 3M after they were found to be leaking radiation. News last week that the ionizers may also leave minute radiation pellets in consumer products had set off a scare in some parts of the country.    In its order yesterday, the NRC said that radiation leakage had been found in some models that weren't covered by the previous recall. Thus, the agency decided to order the recall of all the company's ionizers -- some 45,000 world-wide. &quot;Some of the newly reported failures are located in high public areas such as shopping malls,&quot; the commission said.    The company says it will comply fully with the order. &quot;We just want to maintain confidence in the integrity of 3M,&quot; says Ted Pickens, a 3M spokesman.    He says the company doesn't know how much the recall will cost. He adds that the ionizers, which are leased to customers, bring in $15 million in revenue a year.    So far, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission has identified 39 locations where radiation leakage exceeded guidelines, including plants packaging baby food, soft drinks, cooking oil, dental adhesive, feminine douches and shampoo.    No instances of contaminated products have been found, but several factories have been closed for decontamination scrubs. Arizona officials sent inspectors to 15 food and beverage plants and discovered slight amounts of contamination in two: a Coca-Cola bottling facility in Tempe and an Abbott Laboratories facility in Casa Grande that makes Similac infant formula.    Executives at 3M say that any radiation picked up from faulty ionizers is so slight that it would prove harmless and that any of the tiny radioactive pellets would pass through the body quickly. Indeed, 3M executives, NRC officials and Food and Drug Administration officials all say tests have failed to turn up any product contamination. And apparently no plant workers have been harmed.    But the NRC has questioned the company's testing methods for discovering leaking ionizers and believes that 3M has understated the number of faulty devices in reports to regulators. Moreover, although only small amounts of radiation leakage are believed involved, a commission spokesman says that inhalation of even a few stray radioactive specks from defective ionizers could prove harmful.    &quot;One might work its way down into the lungs and lodge there,&quot; says Jan Strasma, the NRC spokesman. &quot;It's the same kind of respiratory concern you have with chemicals or asbestos.&quot;    The ionizers made by 3M contain a radioactive element -- polonium 210 -- that is wrapped in ceramic and nickel and glued to plastic strips. Ordinarily, the pellets, which are the size of a grain of salt, stay attached to the strips. But in factories where the ionizers are exposed to moisture, solvents or other foreign matter, the pellets may escape and be blown into the inside of a can or bottle, for example, before it is filled.    The industrial sites where the NRC has found faulty ionizers include plants at Anheuser-Busch Cos., Xerox Corp., Ford Motor Co. and McDonnell Douglas Corp.    Executives at 3M acknowledge that the company has been aware of a problem with the glue holding the polonium balls for some time. Mr. Pickens, the 3M spokesman, says the ionizers' operating instructions caution users against washing the devices.    But the NRC claims that 3M also ignored radiation-test procedures for ionizers returned for recharging and misreported the number of leaking devices it discovered. NRC inspectors examining 3M records for 1985 and 1986 found evidence of 84 leaking ionizers; the company reported nine. &quot;We're looking into their rationale for what they reported,&quot; Mr. Strasma says.    Mr. Pickens responds that some employees apparently ignored standard testing procedures and took a shortcut. &quot;Immediate corrective action is being taken,&quot; he says.    On the inadequate record-keeping, Mr. Pickens says if the company erred, &quot;we will implement the appropriate procedure.&quot; As part of an agreement with the commission, 3M has already proposed to revamp its testing procedures and to find a better glue for the microspheres. The company has also agreed to evaluate potential customers' work sites to determine whether 3M ionizers are appropriate. </TEXT></DOC>
