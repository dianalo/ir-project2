Without admitting or denying the charges, the exchange -- a wheat-futures trading venue since 1923 -- agreed to pay a $30,000 civil penalty and agreed not to violate commodities law. The exchange also promised to maintain a log of future investigations of irregularities, and to file monthly reports with the CFTC.    In Minneapolis, an official of the exchange said it agreed to pay the penalty to avoid going to court. The exchange offered to settle with the agency in August.    James Lindau, exchange president, said the amount of the fine &quot;doesn't buy a large amount of attorneys' fees, especially when you're dealing with a Washington regulatory agency.&quot; Mr. Lindau said he doesn't think the fine will taint the exchange's standing among investors. &quot;This is an investigation of our house-cleaning and we are dealing with it as such,&quot; he said. &quot;This is the kind of thing that is common after the Oct. 19 stock market crash and the Boesky investigation.&quot;    From June 1983 through September 1987, the three-count administrative complaint alleged, the exchange failed to exercise &quot;due diligence&quot; in maintaining an &quot;affirmative action&quot; program to ensure compliance with its trading rules. The complaint also alleged that the exchange failed to follow up on data that &quot;should have indicated&quot; possible violations.    CFTC staff members, after detecting numerous shortcomings in the Minneapolis exchange's surveillance program in December 1984, recommended a major overhaul, according to the agency. After a further examination in September 1985 found the situation uncorrected, the agency fined and suspended the exchange's leading trader. After a third inspection last March, the matter was referred to the agency's enforcement division.    The exchange is increasing the size of its compliance staff to six from four following the CFTC inquiry, Mr. Lindau said.    The exchange is responsible for enforcing a variety of trading rules, including prohibitions against prearranged prices, fictitious bids and offers, and attempts to &quot;upset&quot; the market. </TEXT></DOC>
