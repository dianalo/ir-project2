But opposition leaders spurned hisoffer and said he must quit now.   The 60-year-old former army general said in a speech onstate-run TV he was willing to resign 45 days before presidentialelections are held in June 1991.   Ershad, who took power in a 1982 bloodless coup, also offered todissolve Parliament, revoke the emergency on Dec. 16, and hand overpower to a nominee of the opposition before parliamentary andpresidential elections are held.   But the opposition quickly rejected Ershad's surprise offer. Itaccuses Ershad and his People's Party of rigging votes in previouselections. It wants a caretaker government installed before newelections to prevent any repetition of what they call vote fraud.   ``We want Ershad's immediate resignation,'' said Kamal Haider,spokesman for Bangladesh's major opposition alliances. ``He has notannounced any timeframe for the elections and thus he intends tobuy time to hoodwink the opposition. This is not acceptable.''   Opposition parties called 6 a.m. to 2 p.m. nationwide strikesevery day beginning Tuesday to keep up pressure on Ershad.   The opposition says troops killed at least 100 politicalactivists since the emergency was imposed on Nov. 27, and at least1,500 people were injured. The government says six people havedied.   The president's announcement came hours after further violentprotests against the emergency. In the port of Chittagong, 125miles southeast of Dhaka, troops fired on rioting students and atleast 50 people were injured, witnesses said.   Reporters in Chittagong said about 1,000 students hurledhomemade bombs at police and attacked vehicles, injuring at leastsix officers. One officer lost both eyes in a bomb blast, theysaid.   The injured in Chittagong included a policeman who lost botheyes in a bomb blast and five other members of the security forces,reporters said. Like the witnesses, the reporters spoke oncondition of anonymity.   Chittagong, with about 2 million people, is the second-largestcity in Bangladesh. Dhaka, the capital, has about 7 millionresidents.   Ershad said Monday he was willing to hold elections toParliament and the presidency simultaneously.   The opposition campaign was focused on holding fair elections,the president said, adding:   ``I'm willing to hold free and fair elections and give democracyan institutional shape.   ``I firmly believe that the country is above an individual orparty. Noble politics demands that we place the interest of thenation above everything else. Today is the historic day to initiatethe noble process.''   Ershad imposed a state of emergency, forbidding people toassemble, and suspended all civil rights six weeks after theoften-violent opposition campaign began.   The government also lifted press censorship Monday, imposedalong with the emergency. The Information Ministry credited ``theimprovement of the overall situation in the country.''   Journalists have been on strike since Nov. 27 over the emergencyand no newspapers have appeared in Bangladesh since then. Noimmediate word emerged on resuming publication.   Monday's rioting in Chittagong occurred after curfewrestrictions were lifted for 15 hours, the longest relaxation sincethe emergency was imposed.   Curfew was also relaxed for 15 hours Monday in Dhaka. Oppositionworkers organized street protests. Police did not try to break upthe gatherings.   Witnesses reported brief clashes between demonstrators andsecurity forces in three areas of the city, but said no injuriesresulted.   Shops opened and traffic returned to the streets.
