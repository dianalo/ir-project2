(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The United Mine Workers union and ThePittston Co. agreed Tuesday to resume contract talks undersupervision of federal mediators in an effort to end a long andoccasionally violent coalfield strike.   ``You just had the 20th anniversary of man landing on the moon.That was a small step, and this is just one small step,'' saidMichael Odom, president of Pittston Coal Group Inc., Pittston'ssubsidiary.   ``A step is better than no step at all,'' said UMW PresidentRichard Trumka.   Talks will begin Wednesday, they agreed in a meeting called by afederal judge. The two sides will meet in separate rooms at aDuffield hotel with mediators shuttling proposals between them.   About 1,900 UMW members are striking Pittston in a dispute overbenefits and job security. The strike began April 5 in Virginia andWest Virginia before spreading to Kentucky. Hundreds of miners havebeen arrested for a variety of violent incidents as well as civildisobedience tactics.   The walkout at Pittston, one of the few coal companies thatdidn't sign a national UMW contract last year, led to unauthorizedsympathy walkouts beginning last month that affected up to 46,000miners in 10 states.   Most of those miners have since gone back to work, but wildcatstrikes still affect several thousand miners in West Virginia, wheresome shots were fired Tuesday. Union officials in Alabama told morethan 3,000 miners to return for Tuesday night's shift at twocompanies after they failed to show up earlier in the day.   Trumka said he would have preferred that the union and companymeet face-to-face, but he said anything is better than the stalematethat began when previous talks with mediators collapsed in earlyJune.   U.S. District Judge Glen Williams, who brought the two mentogether for a four-hour meeting Tuesday, said Trumka requested thatthe talks begin immediately. He said Odom insisted that the talksbegin in separate rooms.   The two sides also disagreed on who will negotiate for thecompany. Trumka said he is ``obviously disappointed'' that PittstonChairman Paul Douglas declined to participate in talks. Odom saidthe company would not be pressured into changing negotiators.   Trumka said he will attend only Wednesday's initial session andUMW Vice President Cecil Roberts will head the union negotiatingteam. ``The minute Paul Douglas indicates a desire to participate, Iwill be there,'' Trumka said.   Odom would not say who would represent the company.   Trumka said he isn't sure if the agreement to resume talks willprompt the strikers to return to work.   Odom said the wildcat strikes showed that ``there's no comfort ina national contract.''   Negotiations between the two sides broke down June 8. Thegovernors of Virginia and West Virginia had issued similar offers tomediate talks, but Pittston officials had declined them.</TEXT></DOC>
