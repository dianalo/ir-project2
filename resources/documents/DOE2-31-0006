Theyfound that MNNG was absorbed by simple passive diffusion. Transport ofMNNG was the highest at pH 6.0. The addition of the bile salt, taurocholateby itself, greatly increased MNNG absorption, while the addition of thelong-chain unsaturated fatty acids, oleic and linoleic, decreased therate of absorption of MNNG. The phospholipid lecithin addition to theperfusate did not change the rate of MNNG absorption. Induction of dietaryvitamin A deficiency (serum vitamin A level decreased from 40.9 to 13.7{mu}g/dl) did not change the absorption rate of MNNG. These studies demonstratethat bile acids, dietary fatty acids, and the pH of the intestinal contentcan modify the rate of absorption of this carcinogen by the small intestine.Since initial intestinal absorption determines serum levels and subsequentreabsorption and enterohepatic cycling determines long-term lumenal levels,serum levels, and total body content, factors which modify the rate ofintestinal absorption of MNNG could also modify its carcinogenicity.</TEXT></DOC>
