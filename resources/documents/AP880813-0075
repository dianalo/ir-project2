Police said about 30,000 people, including vendors and barwaitresses, faced off against about 5,000 anti-base protesters onthe outskirts of Olongapo, a town about 50 miles west of Manilathat houses the Subic Bay Naval Base. A city official estimated thecrowd at closer to 60,000.   At least one protester was injured when the convoy he wastraveling in was stoned a few miles near Olongapo.   The townspeople, many of whom depend on the Subic base for theirlivelihood, snarled traffic for several hours as they blocked allroads to the base, preventing a 50-vehicle convoy of protestersfrom entering town.   ``Olongaponians love peace and order, so please don't botherus,'' said one of the placards carried by the townspeople. ``We begyou not to disturb the peace in Olongapo'' said another. Residents,some cursing, warned the demonstrators to ``go home or else.''   Some of the townspeople parked buses in the middle of streets toblock traffic, and market vendors used their stalls as roadblocks.Riot police stood between the two groups to prevent clashes.   Olongapo has 250,000 residents, including thousands ofprostitutes, bartenders and dancers working in bars and hotels nearthe U.S. base. The local economy depends not only on the base buton port calls by ships.   At the Subic base, about one mile from the confrontation site,heavily armed Filipino and U.S. troops guarded the gates, whichwere buffered by several rows of barbed-wire barricades.   The demonstrators left after several hours and promised to``return to enlighten the minds of the Olongapo residents.''   On Friday, 2,000 students and some Roman Catholic nuns marchedto the Clark Air Base in the nearby city of Angeles to demand thatU.S. military facilities in the country be closed. After anall-night vigil, they moved on to Subic.   Clark and Subic are the largest U.S. military bases outside theUnited States. About 40,000 service personnel, Defense Departmentcivilians and military dependents are stationed at Clark, Subic andfour smaller installations in the Philippines.   President Corazon Aquino has come under increasing pressure fromleftists, government officials and opposition leaders not to renewthe 1947 bases agreement. She has agreed to honor the lease through1991 but refuses to say if she will support an extension.   U.S. and Filipino panels have been negotiating in thePhilippines for more than four months on terms to apply during theagreement's last two years.   The Manila government is demanding that compensation for thebases be increased to $1.2 billion annually, according to sourcesclose to the talks.   The United States currently provides $180 million a year inmilitary and economic aid in exchange for continued use of thebases.   Government sources say the United States is not willing to paysuch an increase unless it is assured the bases will be allowed toremain beyond 1991.</TEXT></DOC>
