But the talks will now be limited to the single issue ofestablishing who will represent Cambodia at an importantinternational peace conference scheduled to open Sunday, Sihanouktold a news conference today.   Sihanouk insists on a single Cambodian delegation, including allfour factions: the Vietnamese-backed government of Prime MinisterHun Sen, the Chinese-backed Khmer Rouge, the non-communist KhmerPeople's National Liberation Front and Sihanouk's own group.   Hun Sen wants two delegations, one for his Vietnamese-installedgovernment and one led by Sihanouk, representing the rebelcoalition. He blamed the presence of the Khmer Rouge for blockingall chance of agreement.   Underlying the dispute is a disagreement over the Khmer Rougeparticipation in the negotiations and in any post-war coalitiongovernment after the promised Sept. 27 withdrawal of Vietnamesetroops.   ``The Khmer Rouge are monsters. It's understood,'' Sihanoukduring today's news conference at a hotel near Charles de Gaulleairport. ``But that is no reason that we should become aprotectorate of Vietnam.''   The strongest rebel group, the Khmer Rouge was responsible fornearly 1 million deaths as it tried to radically restructuresociety during a three-year reign that ended with the Vietnameseinvasion in 1978.   The Khmer Rouge armed force of 45,000 men has not been beaten bythe Vietnamese Army and is the strongest of the resistance factions.   After Tuesday's meeting _ the first official encounter betweenthe four factions _ the participants said they had reached animpasse.   ``It's like a car that reaches the edge of an abyss and cannotcontinue its journey,'' Hun Sen said. He blamed the Khmer Rouge forthe breakdown in talks.   ``I will not change my position, it is clear. There is no usemeeting again,'' Sihanouk told reporters Tuesday as he left the18th century chateau west of Paris where the four-hour meeting tookplace.   But further discussions behind the scenes Tuesday night wereable to get the talks restarted. The prince said French officialshad asked him to keep trying ``so that there might be at least afew small steps toward a solution.''   Sihanouk met Hun Sen separately on Monday and on Tuesday wasjoined by the other members of the resistance _ Son Sann, amoderate former prime minister and head of the Khmer People'sNational Liberation Front, and Khieu Samphan, the nominal chief ofthe Khmer Rouge.   Sihanouk has contended that not including the Khmer Rouge wouldlead to civil war. Vietnam, the Soviet Union, the United States andmost of the international community want to make sure the KhmerRouge never takes power again in Cambodia.   Two of the issues to be discussed next week are how power willbe shared and how to verify that Vietnamese troops have gone homeand not just changed into Cambodian uniforms.   Resistance forces maintain that more than 30,000 Vietnamesetroops have been integrated into Hun Sen's army.   Sunday's conference will include the participation of India,Japan, Canada, Australia, the five permanent members of the UnitedNations Security Council _ the United States, the Soviet Union,China, Britain and France. Also attending is the six-memberAssociation of Southeast Asian Nations: Indonesia, Thailand,Malaysia, Philippines, Brunei and Singapore.   The talks have coincided with a surge in fighting betweenCambodian guerrillas and Vietnamese-backed government troops alongthe Thai-Cambodian border, Thai and Western officials there said.   Several thousand Khmer Rouge guerrillas have taken part, theWestern analysts said, speaking on condition of anonymity.   Today, Cambodian government gunners shelled at least four Thaivillages as part of an intensified campaign against Cambodianguerrillas along the Thai-Cambodian frontier, Thai militaryofficers said.   Last week, shelling believed to have been conducted bypro-Vietnamese troops forced the evacuation of nearly 40,000refugees from a Khmer Rouge border refugee camp known as Site 8.Most have since returned.</TEXT></DOC>
