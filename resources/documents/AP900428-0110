Under a steady rain, about 20,000 people trudged two miles,chanting and waving placards appealing for peace in their war-torncountry.   ``Not one man, not one woman, not one peso for the war,'' saidone of scores of placards.   ``I did my duty for you, Colombia, and they killed me,'' peoplechanted as they headed for the cemetery on the outskirts of thedowntown area.   In a nationally televised address late Friday night, PresidentVirgilio Barco urged Colombians not to react to Pizarro's murderwith more violence.   Barco said he was doubling the size of a police anti-terroriststrike force that now numbers about 3,000. The strike force hasbeen in Medellin, Colombia's cocaine capital, in a search for thehead of the Medellin cartel, Pablo Escobar.   Pizarro was just starting his presidential campaign when agunman shot him Thursday aboard a domestic airliner.   The 38-year-old candidate had been a leftist guerrilla for 16years and rose to be commander of a rebel organization, the April19 Movement, known as the M-19.   Antonio Navarro, a longtime M-19 guerrilla leader, announcedSaturday that he will run for president in place of Pizarro.   The funeral was held in the Primatial Cathedral on the city'shuge Bolivar Plaza. The cathedral is only about 200 feet from thesite of Colombia's Palace of Justice, which was raided by the M-19in 1985.   More than 100 people were killed in the raid, and a firedestroyed the interior of the building. The palace was torn downlast year.   Pizarro was commander of the M-19 at the time of the guerrillatakeover, but he did not take part in the raid.   Two other presidential candidates besides Pizarro have beenassassinated during the campaign for May 27 elections. Sen. LuisCarlos Galan of the ruling Liberal Party was gunned down lastAugust at a political rally in Bogota, and Bernardo Jaramillo ofthe leftist Patriotic Union Party was killed last month at thecity's airport.</TEXT></DOC>
