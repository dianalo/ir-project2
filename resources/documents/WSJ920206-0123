If advocates of&quot;entrepreneurial&quot; government help modify regulations workingagainst the creation of such housing, the answer may be yes.Consider, for instance, Massachusetts Gov. William Weld'srecent refusal to continue penalizing -- rather than givingincentives to -- owners of low-income housing.   Single-room occupancy units, typically found in roominghouses and residential hotels, are one of the last remainingforms of affordable living space available to the inner-citypoor and transient. Unfortunately, their benefits were longunrecognized by social scientists and urban planners, who sawthem as dangerous to tenants, undesirable to neighborhoods,and generally unwelcome in urban redevelopment plans. Theywere hastened out of existence nationwide by both federal andstate policy beginning in the 1950s. Between 1974 and 1983alone, some 896,000 housing units in the U.S. renting forless than $200 a month, many in SROs, were lost to demolitionor conversion into coops.</LP><TEXT>   In New York City, for instance, one of the nation's mostexpensive housing markets, 98,400 people lived in SROs in1965; by 1986 that number had plummeted to 18,720. Seattlehad seen a similar decline when half the city's units (some16,000) were destroyed for an urban redevelopment planbecause they couldn't comply with a new fire code. A quarterof San Francisco's SRO units were lost (1,247) between 1976and 1985.   Moreover, tightening fire and building codes had made theprospect of building new SROs impractical and unprofitable,particularly given the stringent requirements for minimumliving-space square footage, parking, and cooking and toiletfacilities commonly included in zoning and health bylaws.   In the 1980s, localities, belatedly realizing that SROswere needed for the single poor, instituted moratoriums onthe elimination of these units. But these laws were coercive.In vetoing a bill in October that would have extended amoratorium on the elimination of single room occupancy units,Gov. Weld was heeding a recent Supreme Court decision thatdetermined that a similar New York City ban constituted anunlawful &quot;taking&quot; of private property. But this ruling neednot be bad news for the poor. There are better ways toincrease the number of SROs than forcing their owners tooperate them.   One partial solution to the SRO problem was found in SanFrancisco in 1984, and it may well appeal to Gov. Weld inMassachusetts as a model of how the &quot;entrepreneurialgovernment&quot; he has advocated can meet a public-policyobjective -- in this case, the creation by the private sectorof a vital type of affordable housing.   Hesitant to extend a moratorium on a small number ofexisting -- but decaying and unsafe -- SRO units, andsqueezed by development pressure to change the face of olderneighborhoods where SRO housing was located, San Franciscopolicy makers were persuaded to let a private developerprovide a model by which new SROs could be built. That modelcame to be known as the Baltic, an SRO named after thecheapest property on the Monopoly board.   In a thorough case study written at Harvard's KennedySchool of Government, Andrew Jack and David Kennedy describedthe Baltic as &quot;a four story, 207-room building with a densityequivalent to more than 700 units an acre. The rooms wereonly 120 square feet each, but each contained, in addition toa bed and storage space, a microwave, a large sink with agarbage disposal, and a toilet (partitioned but not closedoff from the rest of the room). Communal showers were on eachhall.&quot;   Most significant, though, was the final per-room cost:&quot;Construction costs -- including land -- were consequentlyvery low, only $14,868 per unit.&quot; Even the Baltic'sbelow-market rents in the $200 to $285 range would thereforebe sufficient to cover costs and allow the developer aprofit.   The developer, Chris Mortenson, was happy to pay for thenew property himself, except for two concessions heeventually received from the city. One was a relaxation inthe way the existing building codes would be interpreted andenforced. Tiny rooms with adjacent open toilets and partialkitchens might have been acceptable to SRO tenants, but theywere expressly forbidden by existing California codes. Onlyafter much negotiation did the developer and city come toterms with that problem: They designated and made legal a newtype of dwelling unit -- a &quot;living unit&quot; -- which wassomething in between a hotel-sized room without a kitchen anda larger, residential-sized room with full kitchen and toiletfacilities.   The only direct subsidy from the city was a low-interestsecond mortgage given to help complete the project'spermanent financing. In return for that participation, 20% ofthe Baltic's units were set aside for poorer tenants atreduced rent levelscapped for the life of the loan.   The Baltic model illustrates how government can help ease-- rather than constrict -- development through cooperativeentrepreneurialism. If Gov. Weld and other policy makers wishto help expedite the creation of affordable SRO housing, thetime might be right for helping the private sector do theright thing.   A key factor in that equation is flexibility ininterpreting zoning and building requirements. That means,for instance, that existing regulations defining acceptabledensity -- number of units on a certain sized parcel of land-- should be modified, given high land costs for thedeveloper and the crying need for housing units for the verypoor who might otherwise be homeless. City parkingrequirements that mandate that minimum numbers of parkingspaces be provided for newly constructed residentialbuildings can also be re-evaluated, particularly since suchrules drive up land acquisition costs, reduce the totalquantity of residential units, and might be inappropriate fora target group of residents least likely to own automobiles.   The experience of the Baltic also indicated an unintendedbut significant side benefit: Existing San Francisco SROs,many of them substandard, had to immediately improveamenities and upgrade overall conditions to successfullycompete in a housing market where newer, more desirable unitslike the Baltic were being built. That model is favorable toone in which the housing market is regulated and an owner'sright to use, convert, or renovate a property is legallyrestricted. And the lesson of the entrepreneurial marketplacehas historically been that investors will more readily enterthe market when government regulations enhance -- rather thandiminish -- the prospect of profitability.   ---   Mr. Cravatts, president of Publications Management Co., apublishing and advertising firm in Newton, Mass., writesfrequently about real estate investment.   ---   Correction                                                                                                          &quot;Loosen Codes and House the Homeless,&quot; on yesterday'seditorial page, misidentified the city whose code changesallowed the Baltic SRO to go forward.
