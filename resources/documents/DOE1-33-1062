These goals can be furtherdetailed as follows: (1) characterize typical marginal sites in the Piedmontof Virginia regarding their soil properties, (2) compare several herbaceousspecies in biomass production on such marginal sites, and (3) determinethe costs of establishment and production for energy crop candidateson these marginal sites. Each of 12 study sites representing three majorPiedmont soils (Appling, Cecil, and Davidson) will be characterized morphologically,chemically, and physically. Seven perennial and one annual herbaceousspecies will be no-till planted and evaluated for biomass yield. Theenergy crop candidates include four grasses and four legumes: tall fescue(Festuca arundinacea), weeping lovegrass (Eragrostis curvula), switchgrass(Panicum virgatum), sorghum-sudangrass (Sorghum bicolor X sudanense),crownvetch (Coronilla varia), sericea lespedeza (Lespedeza cuneata),birdsfoot trefoil (Lotus corniculatus), and flatpea (Lathyrus sylvestris).All field phases of the soil analysis at the 12 marginal study siteshave been completed, and the laboratory analysis is nearing completion.Some preliminary results are given on plant productivity.</TEXT></DOC>
