From 1969 until 1983municipal-waste disposal operations occurred at the site. Most of thewaste disposed of at the site consisted of typical residential, commercial,institutional, and light industrial waste. However, between March 1974and January 1975, Pollution Abatement Services, a hazardous-waste incinerationfacility, was permitted to dispose of approximately 8000 drums containingonly residue coatings. Allegedly, 50 - 200 of these drums contained unidentifiedliquid waste. The condition of these alleged drums is unknown, as istheir location within the landfill. In September 1983, waste disposalat the landfill ceased with the opening of the Bristol Hill Landfillapproximately 2 miles southeast of the site. In the fall of 1985, closureoperations for the Volney Landfill were completed by the current owner,Oswego County. Because the landfill is unlined and has a leachate collectionsystem only in its newer (northern) section, leachate migration is occurringin both horizontal and vertical directions. The primary contaminantsof concern affecting the ground water include: vinyl chloride, benzene,arsenic, VOCs and metals.</TEXT></DOC>
