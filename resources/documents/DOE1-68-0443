Pressure and acceleration measurements were carried out onthe pipe bridge of a water main to determine the axial pipe movement.The preparations and the measurements as well as the theoretical basisof the mathematical simulation are reported. The result of the mathematicalsimulation of a selected test shows nearly all details of the measuredpreliminary runs. Small deviations are mainly due to vertical pipe movement,which is left disregarded in the simulation. All hanger bearings of therack have been found to work almost without any sliding. The good agreementbetween mathematical simulation and measurement bears out the theoreticalconsiderations. This also applies to further studies, on which a separateaccount will be given. It can be anticipated that in the future pipelinesmay with regard to unsteady flow not only be sized on the basis of apressure surge analysis but in the case of freely installed pipes theeffects of unsteady flow on the pipe movement and particularly on thedynamic bearing forces will additionally have to be taken into account.(orig.)</TEXT></DOC>
