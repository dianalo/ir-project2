When the engine is firing, fuel-dilutedoil has no influence on HC emission. During motoring, however, the HCconcentration in exhaust gas increases as the degree of dilution increases.A large amount of HC is emitted when fuel supply is cut to allow theengine to shift from the firing modes to the motoring mode. It is shownthat most of the exhaust HC emitted just after the fuel supply cut comesfrom fuel left on the surface of the intake pipe. If lubricating oilis highly diluted with fuel, HC emission attributed to fuel on the intakepipe wall accounts for a large portion of the total exhaust HC just afterthe fuel supply is cut, followed by a gradual increase in the contentof HC coming from fuel contained in the lubricating oil. Investigationon the emission path of fuel from the lubricating oil shows that highconcentration exhaust HC is largely attributed to the process where HCcontained in the blow-by gas is drawn out of the crank chamber into theintake system.
