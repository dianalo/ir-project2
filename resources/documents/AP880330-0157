Thousands of volunteers have pitched in the past three days toprotect people's lives and property from flooding.   Six people are believed to have died in flood-related accidents.   Floodwaters slowly receded in most of West Germany on Wednesday,but the situation along the Danube River in central Bavaria statewas still critical after the worst flooding in 70 years. About3,500 Bavarians had fled their homes.   In Wiesbaden, U.S. Air Force security police and West Germanfirefighters worked to shore up dikes on the Rhine River withsandbags.   ``We had 70 security police working out there all night withWest German firemen,'' U.S. Air Force spokesman Hans Ostertag said.   No major flooding problems were reported Wednesday in Wiesbaden,near Frankfurt, as the Rhine receded from dangerous levels.   Residents of Ahofling, a Bavarian hamlet 12 miles east ofRegensburg, stayed up Tuesday night trying to keep the Danube frominundating their homes.   ``Most of the 415 residents of Ahofling were up all nightfilling sandbags to bolster a dike,'' said Herbert Zeitler, a statespokesman.   ``The waters are receding slowly but there is still danger ofbreaks in the dike,'' said Zeitler.   Zeitler said property damage ``will run in the millions'' ofdollars.   The Bavarian Interior Ministry warned the situation could againworsen if warmer weather accompanied by heavy rains speeds up thespring thaw of snow in mountainous areas.   ``The ground is saturated and it will take several months beforeit will again be able to absorb any large amounts of water,'' theministry said in a statement.   In Bonn, Chancellor Helmut Kohl issued a statement expressingcondolences to the familes of those who died in the floods andgratitude to people who pitched in to help avert furthercatastrophes.</TEXT></DOC>
