Keithley said.   The company, which makes equipment to measure very lowvoltages of electric current, said it earned $1.1 million onsales of $25.8 million in the fourth-quarter 1990.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Keithley says despite three consecutive years ofsoftness in the company's core businesses, he is comfortablewith analysts' estimates that it will record &quot;slightlybetter&quot; per-share earnings than the 96 cents it earned in theyear ended Sept. 30, 1990. That year, the company posted netincome of $3.4 million on sales of $101 million.   Mr. Keithley also said he expects the company's full-yearresults will meet its internal goals of increasing annual netsales by about 14%, as it has done in the past 10 years.   In the nine months ended June 30, Keithley earned $2.6million, or 75 cents a share, on sales of $74.2 million.   Mr. Keithley said the expected fourth-quarter results willreflect an increase in domestic orders this year which offsetthe slowdown in international markets and the strengtheningof the dollar.   Mr. Keithley cited the &quot;good performance&quot; of the company'sradiation measurements division and the &quot;encouragingresponse&quot; to some of the company's new products, ashighlights in a year marked by continued sluggishness. &quot;Wehad no home runs but three or four of our new products havebeen very well received,&quot; Mr. Keithley said.   Still, the company's software units, Asyst SoftwareTechnologies, Inc. and Metrabyte Corp., continue to showuneven results. In April, the company put in place amanagement reorganization at the two units and Mr. Keithleyexpects the restructuring to improve results in the comingyear. Both units, acquired since 1987, produce computerprograms to record electric current measurements.   The company's efforts at selling measurement instrumentsin North America for Japan's NF Corp., under a marketingalliance signed in 1990, also got off to a &quot;slower thanexpected&quot; start, said Mr. Keithley, who added thatsignificant sales are not expected before 1993.</TEXT></DOC>
