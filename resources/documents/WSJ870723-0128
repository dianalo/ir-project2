CDs take on a new look, as banks market variable-rate, market-indexed and even penalty-free certificates. &quot;The banks' objectives are to attract new money and to lock up funds for long periods,&quot; says Robert Heady of the Bank Rate Monitor, North Palm Beach, Fla. Among the more innovative: Chase Manhattan Bank offers CDs with interest pegged to the Standard andamp; Poor's 500 index; Wells Fargo Bank pegs its six-month CD to London's Wednesday gold closing.    Investors are buying, lured in part by a rise in CD rates of about three-fourths of a percentage point since mid-March. Landmark Banks, St. Louis, says 70% of the money deposited in its new variable-rate CD is &quot;new money.&quot; This despite a $20,000 minimum. National Bank of Lee County, Fla., attracted so many deposits with its four-year, rising-rate CD that it recently discontinued the product. Chase says its Market Index Investment draws deposits from across the U.S. and from overseas.    But, Mr. Heady cautions that most of the CDs are &quot;plain vanilla,&quot; with banks &quot;using mirrors and other tricks to make the instruments look sexier.&quot;    CONSTITUTION FETE creates a flood of commemorative products.    Souvenir items range from a one-pound box of saltwater taffy for $3.99 from Specialty House Candies in Lindenwold, N.J., to a $1,975, limited-edition crystal piece engraved with the preamble to the Constitution from Steuben Glass. Pitney Bowes Inc., Stamford, Conn., offers $25 postage-meter ads commemorating the bicentennial. Knowledge Products Inc., Nashville, Tenn., markets the Constitution story, narrated by Walter Cronkite, on a $9.95 audio tape.    Sales are keeping pace with those from last year's Statue of Liberty bash. But constitutional items should have a longer life, since the celebration runs through 1991. &quot;We think it has a lot of staying power,&quot; says Tom Elsbernd of Allen Co., Blanchester, Ohio, which offers a line of commemorative glassware. &quot;It has national scope rather than just something localized.&quot; But Metro Flag Inc., Dover, N.J., expected a bigger response. It says the official flag is selling but T-shirts and other items aren't.    LANGUAGE TRANSLATION begins to catch the corporate eye.    More American companies see good translation of manuals and documents as a competitive edge in overseas markets. Software companies, for example. &quot;You can get a monopoly position with less competition if you get your product translated and into the market first,&quot; says Ron Posner, president of Ansa Software, Belmont, Calif. Also, law firms and banks are hiring more translators, says John Miller of New York University's translation studies program.    At U.S. companies, translation is a growing but often hidden expense. At $20 to $25 a page, some companies are spending millions of dollars but aren't aware of the cost, says Philip Roussel of consultant A.T. Kearney Inc., Chicago. He says one client estimated translation needs jumping from 50,000 pages a year to 200,000 a year by 1991. Translation staffs, he says, begin making economic sense at 5,000 pages a year.    Many U.S. companies, unused to translating, find they must redesign art work in their manuals because foreign languages take up more room.    FLEAS WITHOUT FIDO: Cornell University researchers develop a glass-and-embrane device for raising fleas in the laboratory. The device allows the insects to feed by piercing a plastic and paraffin membrane. The idea: to create a doglike atmosphere where fleas can be counted easily.    WALL STREET SCANDALS aren't scaring off recent business-school graduates. Harvard University says 30.3% of MBAs in the class of '87 took jobs with investment banking firms. That's up from 29.4% in 1986 and 18.7% in 1985.    FEAR OF DEATH takes a back seat. In a survey of Richmond, Va., entrepreneurs by Richmond Surroundings magazine, 58% of men and 39% of women said failure was the thing they feared most. Fear of loneliness ranked first with 34% of women. Fear of death was a distant third for both men and women.    PARENTING BOOKS remain hot, despite a crowded market.    The number of new books on parenting is accelerating as publishers try to cash in on the current baby boomlet. &quot;They're falling out on the floor, we have so many books in there,&quot; says Rhett Jackson of The Happy Bookseller, Columbia, S.C. Among new titles are books on working mothers, nurturing fathers, day care and teen-agers. The category has grown so fast that some, such as Nannsy Neiman, publisher of Warner Books, say the market is in danger of a glut.    But retailers say sales remain strong. B. Dalton Bookseller says that if the current pace continues, sales of parenting books by Christmas will be up 20% over last year. At Cody's Books Inc., Berkeley, Calif., new titles are selling well. &quot;They all seem to be the same and all of them are selling,&quot; says owner Andy Ross. &quot;Siblings Without Rivalry&quot; is in its fifth week on the New York Times best-seller list.    Dr. Spock remains a big seller. &quot;People tend to buy the standards,&quot; says James Jensen, a B. Dalton buyer.    BRIEFS: The Second City's experimental theater group in Chicago opens a new revue, &quot;Kukla, Fawn and Ollie, or Contra Hear Me Knocking.&quot; . . . A new line of exercise machines for children is called Future Force. </TEXT></DOC>
