For years, the city's old colonial ties, convenient time zone and low regulation attracted orders from around the globe. Now, after growth in international stock portfolios managed in London and an influx of foreign securities firms, the market is taking off. Six months after the &quot;Big Bang&quot; deregulation of British financial markets, London's international market is looking increasingly threatening to other financial centers, as was evident in the New York Stock Exchange's aborted threat last month to ban members from trading U.S. stocks in London while the Big Board is open.    And, for the first time, the financial industry here is actively promoting the market, which includes about 600 stocks from continental Europe, the U.S., Japan and elsewhere.    Figures on January foreign-share trading by members of London's stock exchange, released for the first time last month, were double previous estimates of $552 million a day.    Although indications are that as much activity occurs off the exchange as on it, even January's recorded total means London is doing 50% more business in non-native stocks than the NYSE and U.S. over-the-counter market combined.    Although the incomplete figures mean nobody knows exactly how much the market is growing, there is little doubt it is. Both stock-trading and sales personnel at Morgan Stanley International and Goldman Sachs in London have increased about 50% in the last year. Meanwhile, Euro-equities, or stock offerings across borders, whose market is centered in London, quadrupled in two years to about $11.3 billion in 1986.    The biggest advocate of more growth is what once was called the London Stock Exchange. Last December, it merged with a 187-member trade group that included most of the biggest securities firms in the world, and renamed itself the International Stock Exchange. The exchange's governing council is now dominated by foreigners or Britons working for foreign-owned firms, including Merrill Lynch andamp; Co., Nomura Securities and Deutsche Bank AG.    &quot;What Wall Street hasn't focused on is that we now have the most formidable membership of anyone in the world,&quot; says Jeffrey Knight, chief executive officer of London's exchange. &quot;It was a cardinal principle of the merger that (the big U.S. firms) would commit themselves to the idea of an international stock exchange here.&quot;    The biggest change in London since October's Big Bang has been &quot;a dramatic upturn in European equity business&quot; says Jacques Gelardin, chairman of Shearson Lehman Brothers International, a unit of American Express Co. Although Big Bang dealt only with domestic markets, it enhanced &quot;a perception that London is the most liquid and strongest capitalized European financial center for share dealing,&quot; Mr. Gelardin says.    Before Big Bang, &quot;the best place to execute a block trade of Swedish shares was Stockholm,&quot; he says. &quot;Now it's London.&quot;    By dealing in London, traders in Sweden, Germany and other European countries also avoid high transfer taxes or commissions at home. One recent morning, a London market-maker sold Electrolux AB, a big Swedish company, at $48.50 a share, while another bought at $48.125.    The tight &quot;spread&quot; of 37.5 cents indicates a fair deal for investors. But if Swedish taxes and commissions had to be paid, the spread would widen to about $1.50. &quot;People come here because it's cheaper, it's as simple as that,&quot; says David Head, head international trader at Shearson Lehman.    Philip Gray, international investment boss at GT Management in London, sees the rest of Europe steadily losing trading business to a better capitalized, more efficient London market. GT, with 5 billion pounds, or the equivalent of $8.04 billion under management, increasingly trades its big block orders in European equities in London.    Some countries are fighting back. France's finance minister last month proposed opening the Paris bourse to foreign firms. The Netherlands abolished fixed commission scales for large trades. Germany and Sweden, however, have resisted financial-industry pressure to reduce trading taxes, and that reluctance could add to London's swelling tide.    Higher trading volume in foreign shares also means more sales contact with an international range of investors, improving London's ability to handle new international stock issues. Last week, a syndicate of six big American securities firms led a separate London-based syndicate that placed $189 million of the $1.65 billion in Conrail shares sold by the U.S. government. Underwriters' losses marred a $2.2 billion sale of Fiat S.p.A. shares last December, but the London-based issue was still the largest sale ever in the secondary market.    As in the U.S. over-the-counter market, trading in non-British shares here doesn't take place on an exchange floor. Telephones and video screens link traders and investors.    One recent morning, Shearson Lehman's Mr. Head was on the phone to Germany. The West German mark was rising against the dollar, putting more pressure on German exports. Mr. Head feared the German stocks he bought the day before were headed down.    By 8:40 a.m., Shearson unloaded about $500,000 of shares such as Siemens AG and BASF AG. There was plenty of trading in Germany too, but German traders and investors like dealing with London because they can see prices on the video displays before dickering. Since the exchange began its international stock display, says Mr. Head, &quot;our volume has gone up about 10 times.&quot;    London traders already dominate two Europe-wide video-screen networks started in 1985 to carry international share price quotes. The systems, one run by the exchange and one by Reuters Holdings PLC, give investors in many European countries the best available running account of their home markets.    Toward the unabashedly avowed goal of grabbing trading in other countries' shares, the exchange plans to install a computer system by the end of the year to allow its video-screen network to carry the price-quote advertising of more firms in more non-U.K. stocks. Some exchange planners want traders outside London to plug in. They also want an electronic tickertape in London to carry those traders' last-sale and volume reports in non-British shares.    Still, even as the exchange's new aggressive posture promises more business for London, it raises new regulatory questions.    The screen networks display quotes but no actual sale prices, and they carry incomplete lists of stocks and traders. That adds greatly to profits, London brokers admit privately.    Regulations don't require the many nonexchange members in the business to report trades, best bids and offers, or even the fact that they are dealing in a stock. That means investors have no sure way of knowing where to get the best price, giving the professionals a big advantage.    The Securities and Investments Board, Britain's new financial watchdog, wants such reporting by the end of this year. But brokers say they won't accept regulations that give too much away. Because the SIB wants to avoid driving business from London, it probably will be accommodating.    Alan Nash, PaineWebber Inc.'s London boss and head of the international-stock committee at the exchange, says the frequency and detail of reporting requirements &quot;is still open to question.&quot;    Others, though, are blunter. &quot;There isn't going to be a last-sale tape,&quot; says the head of one U.S. securities firm in London. &quot;Let's face it, the more transparent a market is, the less profitable it is.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
