In Islamabad, Pakistan, the guerrillas rejected the cease-fire,which was called to observe a religious holiday. ``The cease-firedoesn't have any meaning for the guerrillas because we began ourfight to get rid of the communists and the problem is not solved,''a rebel spokesman said.   The official Soviet news agency Tass said in a dispatch fromKabul that 44 guerrillas were killed and 62 wounded in artillerybattles in the Kabul area and elsewhere around the country.   Tass said insurgents fired missiles Tuesday at the central mosquein Kandahar while a religious service was in progress. It said eightpeople were killed and 20 wounded. Battles also were reportedTuesday in Kabul and the provinces of Ghor, Balkh, Fariab andBadakhshan.   Foreign Ministry spokesman Mohammad Nabi Amani said 100 rocketswere fired late Tuesday into the Paghman Mountains, 12 milesnorthwest of Kabul.   ``We understand our brave armed forces have successfully carriedout the task given to them to destroy the (guerrilla) positions,''Amani said. He did not have casualty figures.   The rocket barrage preceded by a few hours the Tuesday midnightstart of a four-day cease-fire declared by the government to observethe Islamic holiday of Eid al-Adha, or Feast of Sacrifice.   ``We will not fire a single bullet (during the cease-fire), butif we are fired upon, we will take up arms and destroy theenemies,'' Amani said.   President Najib's spokesman, Sarwar Yourish, said Tuesday thetroops would cease hostilities until midnight Saturday for theholiday, which is held two months and 10 days after the end ofRamadan, the Moslem month of fasting.   Amani said, ``We had information that the opponents had massed alarge number of rockets to hit Kabul during the Eid, so we carriedout a pre-emptive operation.''   The guerrillas, supported by the United States and mostly basedin Pakistan, are trying to overthrow the Soviet-backed governmentthat seized power in a 1978 coup.   Afghanistan and the Soviet Union have alleged that theguerrillas, along with Pakistani military advisers, are planning anoffensive on Kabul and Najib's government has warned that it mayshell Pakistan.   Pakistan has denied Najib's charges that it is directly involvedin the attacks.   The Soviet Union ended nine years of military involvement inAfghanistan when it withdrew the last of its troops on Feb. 15 undera U.N.-mediated accord. Moscow, however, has continued to supplyarms to the Kabul government.</TEXT></DOC>
