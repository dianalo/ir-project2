Since the counties began offering their Highway 17 express, the suitsays, Peerless' ridership has fallen by about a quarter. The company said itlost more than $65,000 in ticket revenue.;    The suit asks a Santa ClaraCounty Superior Court judge to order the counties to stop the service andcompensate the company for its losses.;    The counties started the serviceafter the Oct. 17 earthquake, which left more than 20,000 Santa Cruz andmountain residents stranded with Highway 17 closed. The counties initiallyplanned to halt the service once the highway was reopened to private commutersin late November.;    But as the deadline approached, letters and phone callspoured in by the hundreds, demanding that the service continue, said BruceKosanovic, a Santa Clara County Transit spokesman. The counties agreed. Sincethen, Santa Clara County has spent more than $550,000 on the route.;   Peerless had operated a similar service since 1932, running buses from SantaCruz to San Jose, then to Oakland, but with less success. By the time of theearthquake, ridership was under 200 passengers a day.;    There are some cleardifferences in the service.;    A round-trip ticket over the mountains onPeerless costs $8, compared with the county-subsidized $2 fare.;    And countybuses run far more frequently, as often as 10 minutes apart during peakcommute hours, compared with Peerless' hourly intervals.;    Early on, thecounties contracted with Peerless and another operator, Discovery Tours, tooperate some of the runs. But in December 1989, Discovery won a bid to supplydrivers for the counties' buses to make the run. Peerless was again thecompetition.;    Peerless contends that the counties violated state andfederal laws forbidding county transit systems from competing with privatecompanies that do a large portion of their business in those counties withoutoffering those companies adequate compensation.;    So far, both transitdistricts have dismissed the suit as groundless. Bob Weers, the Santa ClaraCounty deputy counsel representing the transit district, said Santa ClaraCounty negotiated a buyout with Peerless back in the 1970s, when the districtformed.;    After the buyout, Peerless opted to continue the service to SantaCruz with the full knowledge of &quot;pending competition,&quot; Weers said. Peerlesslost a similar suit after the county initiated service to Fremont.;    ScottGalloway, general manager of Santa Cruz County Transit, said the two servicesare not in direct competition. Peerless runs from downtown Santa Cruz todowntown San Jose, with stops in Los Gatos; county service avoids downtownSanta Cruz.;    The suit is scheduled for trial May 2.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  DEBORAH ANDERLUH, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910410  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Wednesday  </DAY><MONTH>  April  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  521  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Wednesday April 10, 199100101107,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
