(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The pilot and co-pilot of a FederalAviation Administration plane that crashed in 1988, killing allthree crew members, were seen drinking the night before theaccident, according to a federal report.   The National Transportation Safety Board report, released thisweek in Washington, also said the co-pilot previously had lost hisdriver's license for driving under the influence of alcohol.   The board ruled the pilot's failure to reduce ice buildup causedthe twin-engine jet to crash in November 1988, 11{ miles from theWestmoreland County Airport near Latrobe.   The NTSB report said the pilot, James E. Burger, 64, of Linwood,N.J., had a blood-alcohol level of 0.057 percent and the co-pilot,Richard M. Wadsworth, 46, of Ocean City, N.J., had traces ofalcohol in his urine. Also killed was an FAA technician.   Federal aviation rules bar pilots from flying civil aircraftwithin eight hours after consumption of any alcoholic beverage,while under the influence of alcohol or while having 0.04 percentblood-alcohol content. The legal limit for driving in Pennsylvaniais 0.10 percent.   The board concluded Burger's blood-alcohol content was duepartly to decomposition and fermenting of body fluids.   Dr. Charles Winek, director of the Pittsburgh laboratory thatprepared a toxicology report on the bodies for the WestmorelandCounty Coroner's Office, agreed Thursday that body fluids canferment during putrification, which can result in the production ofethyl alcohol.   ``However, this occurs in a hot, humid climate ... over a matterof weeks,'' he told the Tribune-Review of Greensburg. ``This wasNovember. In wintertime it would take a lot longer than a matter ofa couple of hours to occur.''   The men, based at the FAA Center in Pomona, N.J., were on aroutine inspection flight to test the radar landing-guidance systemat the Westmoreland County Airport.   The NTSB said the aircraft's ice-detection system had beenoperating only intermittently. Despite forecasts of icingconditions in the area, the crew decided to complete their testing,the NTBS said.   ``Evidence indicated crew noticed ice accretion, activatedsurface de-ice system, ice broke loose and entered engine intakes.Both engines flames out,'' the report said.   The agency said ice that entered the engine intakes damaged thecompressor assembly and blades.   ``Both pilots had personal stresses which may have influencedperformance,'' the report said.   The report said Burger had decided to retire that day andWadsworth recently had lost his driver's license.</TEXT></DOC>
