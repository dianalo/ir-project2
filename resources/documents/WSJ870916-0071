The campgrounds operator said the notes, totaling about $57 million, allow a 30-day grace period for payment of interest. Thousand Trails said that it is in &quot;active discussion&quot; with senior bank lenders and the holder of most of its senior subordinated notes, and is in &quot;final negotiations with a large national corporation on a restructuring plan.&quot;    The plan being negotiated involves exchange of a substantial portion of its debt for common stock, the company said. Details weren't disclosed, and company officials couldn't immediately be reached.    Thousand Trails said its decision to defer interest payment on the notes will be &quot;reconsidered&quot; after it reaches agreement on the restructuring plan, but within the 30-day grace period.    In the first six months, Thousand Trails had a net loss of $8 million on revenue of $41.4 million. As previously reported, Moody's Investors Service recently downgraded the company's senior subordinated notes to Caa from single-B-3, citing its expectation that Thousand Trails will have &quot;continued marginal financial performance for the intermediate term.&quot;    In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Thousand Trails closed at $2.875, up 12.5 cents a share. </TEXT></DOC>
