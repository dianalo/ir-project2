The sources said the three gunmen are among dozens of suspectsthe Amal militia rounded up while searching for Lt. Col. William R.Higgins but that the man who masterminded the U.N observer'sabduction remained at large.   The gunmen, who were not identified, could not give theirleader's whereabouts or say where Higgins was being held, said thesources, who spoke on condition of not being further identified.   Reporters in southern Lebanon last week reported that the Amalmilitia had detained more than 40 suspects, but this was the firstindication that the three gunmen were among those held.   The same sources said today that at least two Israeli soldierswere killed and several wounded when their armored patrol wasambushed by Arab guerrillas in the southern Lebanese village ofBraachit at sundown Monday.   It was not clear whether the ambush and kidnapping were related.   Higgins, 43, of Danville, Ky., was kidnapped south of theancient port of Tyre on Wednesday. The security sources said thethree gunmen were captured in a dragnet in the two days followingthe abduction.   ``Among the detainees are the three gunmen who seized Col.Higgins and forced him into the first getaway car,'' one sourcesaid.   Another three suspects who were being held monitored Higgins'his movements before the abduction, the same source said.   The source provided the information when asked for confirmationof an NBC News report that the three kidnappers had been captured.   The gunmen were being held by Amal in Tyre and had beeninterrogated, but they were unable to provide useful informationbecause their leader had kept them in the dark, the source said.   The security source played down the significance of the gunmen'sdetention, saying the unidentified person who masterminded thekidnapping already had slipped out of south Lebanon.   ``The operation was a masterpiece from a professionalstandpoint,'' the source said. ``The mastermind used five identicalbrown Volvo cars plus two additional getaway cars, a white Peugeotand a red Mercedes, in the abduction. The squad in each car did notknow who was in the other car.''   The Organization of the Oppressed on Earth, a pro-Iranian ShiiteMoslem group, released a videotape Monday in which Higgins recitedits demands for his release, including an Israeli pullout from aborder zone in south Lebanon.   The organization charged that Higgins was a CIA spy. U.S. andU.N. officials denied the claim.   Higgins heads a 76-man U.N. observer group drawn from 16 nationsthat monitors border violations of a 1949 armistice signed byLebanon and Israel.   The group was attached to the 5,800-strong United NationsInterim Force in Lebanon in 1978, when the nine-nation force wasdeployed to keep peace on the Lebanon-Israel border.   Timur Goksel, the force spokesman, said the search continued forHiggins today in the Tyre region, 50 miles south of Beirut.   Goksel said 20 officers of Higgins' observer group have beenwithdrawn to U.N. posts along the Israeli border.   The kidnapping increased friction between Shiite forces vyingfor dominance in southern Lebanon.   It pitted the moderate Amal, which is backed by Syria and istrying to rescue Higgins, against the extremist Hezbollah, or Partyof God, which is loyal to Iran and has declared support for thekidnappers, calling Higgins a ``filthy American.'' Hezbollah isbelieved to be an umbrella for groups holding most of the 25foreigners missing in Lebanon.   Amal's spokesmen say a total of 42 fundamentalists have beenrounded up in the Tyre region since Higgins' abduction. Hezbollahclaims more than 150 fundamentalists were arrested by the Amalmilitia.   Higgins is the ninth American missing after being kidnapped inLebanon since March 1985. The other foreign hostages are fourFrenchmen, three Britons, two West Germans, a Swede, a Norwegian,an Italian, an Irishman, an Indian and two unidentified men.   The longest-held hostage is Terry A. Anderson, chief Middle Eastcorrespondent of The Associated Press, who was kidnapped March 16,1985.</TEXT></DOC>
