That is the possibility that unreasonably high qualifications for child-care workers are increasing the cost.    About 20 years ago, one of my daughters applied for work in a child-care center, and was told that she did not qualify even though she had one year of college. If such requirements had prevailed when I was a child, neither of my parents would have qualified to care for me.    I am in favor of references and fingerprint checks, but unreasonable educational requirements could place child care beyond the reach of many families who need it most. Of course, parents who are more affluent can demand higher qualifications for child-care workers and pay higher fees.    Mark L. Wightman   Burlingame, Calif.</TEXT></DOC>
