(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Television evangelist Jimmy Swaggart hasaccused Penthouse magazine of trying to destroy his ministry througha ``diabolical and slanderous'' story in which a stripper says sheperformed sexual acts for him.   The stripper's employer labeled the woman's allegations, detailedin the magazine's current issue, ``a pornographic fairy tale.'' AsSwaggart threatened to file a libel suit Monday, the magazine saidit was standing by its article.   The allegations by the woman, Catherine Mary Kampen, are similarto those levied last year by a prostitute, Debra Murphree. Thoseallegations led to Swaggart's ouster from the Assemblies of God, aPentecostal denomination, and a major downturn in the fortunes ofJimmy Swaggart World Ministries.   ``There is not one shred of truth to these allegations. I havenever met or seen the woman,'' Swaggart said at a news conference athis ministry headquarters.   ``Our attorneys learned of this fraudulent story in December andhad clearly shown Penthouse and its porno writer, Art Harris (theauthor), that the story was untrue,'' Swaggart said. ``We now knowthat they already knew and did not care that it was a lie.''   Penthouse spokesman Sy Presten issued a statement for publisherBob Guccione saying the magazine stood behind the story.   ``The fact that she was with Swaggart has been corroborated byher husband and others in Louisiana,'' the statement said. ``Thethings she reports Swaggart made her do are very similar to thestory of Debra Murphree ... which have never been contradicted.''   Kampen, 38, was quoted in Penthouse as saying Swaggart gained hertrust with his counseling, then emotionally manipulated her intoacting out sexual fantasies.   She was reported to be in New York for promotional appearancesabout the article and could not be reached for additional comment.   Rhonda Shear, co-owner of ``Hot Lines,'' a strip-tease telegramservice that employs Kampen in New Orleans, said her sister, Nona,told her that Kampen made up the story after seeing the Penthouseaccount of Murphree's relations with Swaggart.   ``She told my sister it was all concocted,'' Shear said in atelephone interview from Los Angeles. ``She saw the issue with DebraMurphree (and said) ... `It's only a matter of time before someonejumps on that band wagon. Why not me?' ... She said it was foolproofif she said it happened at her house.''   Shear's sister, contacted in New Orleans, said a lawyer hadadvised her not to comment. She refused to confirm her sister'sstory.   At the news conference, Swaggart accused Penthouse of conspiringto destroy his ministry and asked for public support.   ``I am appealing to the American people, and especially theChristians, to help us by letting the pornographers know they havefilled this land with their filth far too long. There seems to be noend to their diabolical slander.''   Attorney Dennis Brewer, a member of the ministries' board ofdirectors, said Monday that a lawsuit would be filed within the nextfew days in Texas, where punitive damages are permitted in libelactions.   Last February, Swaggart confessed to an undisclosed sin, andMurphree said she had been paid by the evangelist to perform sexacts while he watched. Swaggart later was defrocked by theAssemblies of God after refusing to step down from the pulpit for atleast a year.   The furor resulted in the cancellation of Swaggart's programsfrom three major cable television networks, an exodus of studentsand faculty from his Bible college and layoffs from the ministry, amajor Baton Rouge employer.</TEXT></DOC>
