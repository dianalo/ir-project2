Anthony, an Ardmore, Okla. rancher, started raising Longhorns 25years ago and has fallen in love with the breed.   ``They are extremely intelligent. You can make housepets outthem if you want.''   But it's not their intelligence that is putting them back on themarket.   ``The bottom line is the Longhorn has qualities consumers wanton their dinner plates and the qualities many ranchers are seekingto develop in their livestock,'' said Mike Moeller, deputy stateagriculture commissioner.   Moeller said Longhorn beef has 10 percent fat and yields agreater percentage of lean beef than any other breed. The hardybreed had been replaced by fatter stock by the turn of the century.   For cattlemen, Longhorns are a low-maintenance, genetic goldmine.   Descended from Spanish cattle brought here centuries ago, theLonghorn has adapted to severe climates, can forage on poor qualitygrass, is resistant to several diseases and produces rich milk.   When bred with other breeds, the Longhorns cut down on thenumber of calving problems, Moeller said.   Also there is the mystique of raising an animal that helpedcreate the cowboy and turn the country into a people of beefeaters.   ``When you have something that has been for so many years ofhistorical greatness, it's hard not to be fond of Texas Longhorncattle,'' Anthony said.   The first Longhorns were sent out of Texas to New Orleans in the1840s. A few were driven to Missouri later in that decade. In the1850s, Longhorns were herded all the way to Chicago.   But the Civil War intervened and the men who had been drivingcattle took up arms or sold the cattle they raised to armies fromboth sides.   After the war, driving Longhorns to railheads in Kansas becamebig business.   The Texas State Historical Association estimates that 10 millionLonghorns were driven northward on the Chisholm Trail during thefirst 25 years after the the Civil War.   The Longhorn replaced the buffalo as meat for men who werebuilding the railroads and helping the population move westward.The huge buffalo herds had been decimated by too much hunting.</TEXT></DOC>
