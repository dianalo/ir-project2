The Japanese robotics maker explained in a statement thatit is giving up its plan to buy 40% of Moore Special ToolCo., Bridgeport, Conn., because of delays in &quot;obtaininggovernment approval&quot; and a surge in congressional oppositionto the transaction.</LP><TEXT>   An interagency panel recommended more than a month agothat the deal be allowed to go through, but President Bushhas yet to indicate how he stands on the proposedacquisition. The White House isn't obliged to respondpromptly to such recommendations because the statute that setdeadlines for such reviews expired in October.   Adding to Fanuc's discomfiture were demands by Reps. JohnDingell (D., Mich.), Mel Levine (D., Calif.), Helen Bentley(R., Md.) and other legislators that Mr. Bush block thepurchase on national security grounds.   A House Energy and Commerce Committee panel had scheduleda hearing on the Fanuc-Moore matter for next Tuesday.   &quot;In light of the review procedure's indefinite durationand burdensome nature to all concerned, it would serve nouseful purpose either to Moore or to Fanuc to continue topursue the investment,&quot; Fanuc said in its statement.   The Fanuc-Moore deal is the second proposed Japaneseacquisition of a sensitive U.S. high-technology concern toencounter major obstacles in the past three months. TheJustice Department is challenging on antitrust grounds NipponSanso K.K.'s bid to purchase Semi-Gas Systems Inc., asubsidiary of Hercules Inc.   Although the administration insists that U.S. open-doorpolicy toward foreign investment is unchanged, the troublesof Fanuc and Nippon Sanso could signal more officialsensitivity to Japan's relentless shopping for U.S. hightechnology.   Fanuc and Moore would have made a good match, according toU.S. industry representatives. Fanuc makes numerical controlsfor programming machine tools; the Connecticut companyproduces state-of-the-art jig grinders and measuringmachines. The combination would have enhanced both concerns'competitive positions, U.S. analysts said.   Machines made by Moore are used to make certain parts fornuclear weapons, but the company said such sales representless than 10% of its overall business.   The government review panel reportedly gave weight toMoore's argument that unless it receives an infusion of newcapital, its ability to continue contributing to U.S. defenseneeds could be in jeopardy. Moore's attorneys said Fanuc'soffer of $10 million for minority ownership was the mostattractive among several financial alternatives the concernhad entertained.   Fanuc responded to initial objections from the panel byagreeing not to participate in the management of Moore unlessits financial situation worsened.   The White House appeared to be leaning toward acceptingthe panel's recommendations before it was bombarded bycongressional protests. Kevin Kearns, an Economic StrategyInstitute analyst who helped ignite the opposition, said theadministration should try to help Moore find a new partner,preferably a U.S. one.   &quot;The government brokers billions of dollars in deals torescue failing thrifts,&quot; he said. &quot;I see no reason why theycan't do a little of the same to save a good U.S. high-techcompany.&quot;   Seth Brody, Moore's legal counsel, said the collapse ofthe Fanuc deal won't affect the U.S. company's currentbusiness. &quot;We'll pull up our sleeves and regroup, and not gooff in hot pursuit of another capital source,&quot; he said.   Mr. Levine, the California congressman, said he will seeklegislation to create a loan guarantee fund to help keepfinancially ailing companies such as Moore alive while theysearch for &quot;appropriate American buyers.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
