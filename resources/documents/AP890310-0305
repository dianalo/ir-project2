The jobless rate was down 0.3 percentage points from January,hitting 5.1 percent for first time since May 1974, the LaborDepartment said. The rate last was lower in December 1973, when ithit 4.9 percent.   At the same time, employers created 289,000 new nonfarm jobs lastmonth, with the gains confined to service-producing industries,according to a separate survey of business payrolls.   February's job-growth figure reflected some fallback afterpayrolls grew by a robust 415,000 jobs in January, when employmentwas spurred by unusually mild weather. January's figure was revisedupward from an initial estimate of 408,000 new jobs.   The latest figures provided fresh evidence that the economycontinues to command strength in the seventh year of its recordpeacetime expansion despite widespread anticipation of an impendingslowdown.   At the White House, spokesman Marlin Fitzwater called the drop inthe unemployement rate ``good news'' and said ``jobs are still thebest barometer of a sound economy.''   ``While the numbers are volatile on a monthly basis, the economycan continue to create jobs and inflation remain in check,''Fitzwater said.   Daniel T. Van Dyke, senior economist for Bank of America in SanFrancisco, said February's strong numbers are ``good in the nearterm'' but raise concern about growing inflationary pressures fromtight labor markets.   ``Certainly numbers like these do nothing to suggest pressurewill be coming off labor markets,'' he said. ``The labor force justisn't growing fast enough to sustain employment growth at the ratewe're experiencing right now.''   The unemployment rate had hovered around 5.3 percent and 5.4percent for the prior five months.   Janet L. Norwood, commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics,said in testimony prepared for Congress that ``many wondered whetherit was possible for the rate to decline any further or whether thelabor market had already expanded as far as it could go.''   She said that while the decline was important, most of thedecrease was among groups whose jobless rates tend to be erratic,notably youth and Hispanics.   ``We need another month or so of data to determine whether thissingle month's phenomenon will be sustained,'' Ms. Norwood said.   Overall, the civilian labor force contracted by 247,000 peoplelast month to 123.2 million, while 142,000 workers found jobs,according to the department's monthly sample of households, fromwhich the jobless rate is calculated.   With the rise in employment, 62.9 percent of working-ageAmericans held jobs, matching the record high level set in January.   February's job growth was paced by gains in service-producingsectors, while employment in goods-producing industries decreasedslightly due to a weather-related decline in construction.   There were 321,000 new jobs in the service-producing sector ofthe economy, including gains in health and business services.   Construction employment was down 22,000 jobs due to harsh weatherafter a strong surge in January that had been attributed largely tomild weather.   Manufacturing employment was down 8,000 jobs after steadilyincreasing since September.   In figures closely watched for signs of inflation, the reportshowed that seasonally adjusted average hourly earnings ofnonsupervisory employees were up a slim 0.1 percent and averageweekly earnings declined 0.2 percent in February.   A separate unemployment calculation including the 1.7 millionmembers of the armed forces stationed in the United States alsostood at 5.1 percent in February, down from 5.4 percent a monthearlier.   In the civilian population, the jobless rate among whites was 4.3percent last month, down from 4.6 percent in January, while theunemployment rate for blacks was 11.9 percent, down from 12 percent.   The jobless rate among Hispanics plunged to 6.8 percent from 8.4percent in January.   The rate for teen-agers dropped by 1.6 percentage points to 14.8percent, while the unemployment rate for young adults aged 20 to 24fell 1.2 points to 8.1 percent.   Analysts have long been forecasting an economic slowdown, butmost reports at the start of 1989 have indicated the economycontinues to demonstrate strong momentum.   ``We've had strong growth in employment that suggests we're goinginto the first quarter with significant gains already in ourpocket,'' economist James Annable of First National Bank of Chicagosaid in advance of today's report. ``We're not going to get asignificant slowdown in growth in the first quarter.''   Analysts now expect the slowdown to materialize later this yearas higher interest rates begin to take their toll.   The Federal Reserve Board for a year has been pushing up interestrates in an effort to restrain excessive economic growth and keepinflation in check.   The Fed's latest round of credit-tightening came after reportsshowed consumer prices rose 0.6 percent during January and wholesaleprices shot up 1 percent. Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan blamed theincreases in part on acceleration of wage increases in the tightlabor market.</TEXT></DOC>
