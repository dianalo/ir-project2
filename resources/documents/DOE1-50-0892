Hope Creek was a boiling water reactor(BWR) design and Pilgrim was a pressurized water reactor (PWR) design.Neither were ever placed in service. Objectives were to evaluate theseLWR segments for flaws with ultrasonic and liquid penetrant techniques.Both objectives were successfully completed. One significant indicationwas detected in a Hope Creek seam weld by ultrasonic techniques and characterizedby further analyses terminating with destructive correlation. This indication[with a through-wall dimension of {similar_to} 6 mm ({similar_to} 0.24in.)] was detected in only 3 m (10 ft) of weldment and offers extremelylimited data when compared to the extent of welding even in a singlepressure vessel. However, the detection and confirmation of the flawin the arbitrarily selected sections implies the Marshall report estimates(and others) are nonconservative for such small flaws. No significantindications were detected in the Pilgrim material by ultrasonic techniques.Unfortunately, the Pilgrim segments contained relatively little weldment;thus, the authors limited their ultrasonic examinations to the claddingand sublcadding regions. Fluorescent liquid penetrant inspection of thecladding surfaces for both LWR segments detected no significant indications[i.e., for a total of approximately 6.8 m{sup 2} (72 ft{sup 2}) of claddingsurface].</TEXT></DOC>
