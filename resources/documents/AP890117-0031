Subtle irregularities in electrical activity and blood flow werefound in brains of 60 percent of stutterers, whose speech is brokenby abnormal pauses, repetitions (st-st-stuttering) or prolongations(ssssstuttering) of sounds, said audiologist Terese Finitzo, whodirected the University of Texas studies.   She said similar brain abnormalities were detected in 84 percentof people with spasmodic dysphonia, in which malfunctioning vocalcords produce a hoarse, strained, strangled-sounding voice.   The Dallas scientists studied 20 stutterers and 77 people withspasmodic dysphonia by examining magnetic resonance imaging picturesof brain anatomy. Unlike CAT scans, which use X-rays, the techniqueuses a giant magnet and radio waves to make pictures of organs.   The scientists also made maps of brain electrical activity asmeasured by electrodes on the head; and images of brain blood flow.   But they also developed a way to process the two-dimensional mapsof brain electrical activity to pinpoint the location of thatactivity.   That let them superimpose the brain anatomy and electricalactivity images, then string them together on videotape to make ``ananimated movie or cartoon, so as electrical activity progresses youcan see it moving through the brain'' in three dimensions, said Dr.Kenneth Pool, a neurologist in the Texas group. Blood-flow imageswill be added later.   Such technology might help scientists understand how the brainworks, and perhaps eventually how to better diagnose and treatspeech defects, mental illness, epilepsy, dyslexia, Alzheimer's andParkinson's diseases, post-stroke speech loss and other disorders,Pool said.   The technique ``is expected to radically alter (brain) diseaseevaluation and management for neurologists, psychiatrists andneurosurgeons,'' said a news release from the AmericanSpeech-Language-Hearing Association.   Scientists have long believed that the speech impediments werepsychological. But in recent years, many have linked the impedimentsto brain malfunctions that can be aggravated by psychological stress.   That view is supported by findings of the government-funded, $2million Texas research outlined by Finitzo, Pool and colleaguesMonday at the annual meeting of the American Association for theAdvancement of Science.   The studies also suggest the speech defects have many causes,because not all the patients had brain abnormalities, Pool said.   About 1 percent of Americans stutter to some degree. Spasmodicdysphonia is uncommon, although there are no reliable estimates,Finitzo said.   Stutterers and people with spasmodic dysphonia often receivespeech therapy to learn to slow down, breathe differently orotherwise alter their speaking habits, but for many ``the benefitsare minimal,'' Pool said.   He said patients are relieved when told their stuttering orspasmodic dysphonia is physical.   ``We've had people say, `Thank God it's not my fault.' They don'thave to feel responsible for it, (even) if everybody's telling them,`If you just relax you can speak better,''' he said.   Arnold E. Aronson, head of speech pathology at the Mayo Clinic inMinnesota, said there are several forms of the speech defects andthat people whose stuttering is psychological may get impropertreatment if they believe otherwise.   Aronson questioned the reliability of the Texas team's methods,saying they were biased by preconceptions and studied too fewpatients. He also accused them of making conclusions ``far beyondwhat the facts imply'' and of failing to conduct adequatepsychiatric exams of their patients.   But he did say ``there is great merit in what they are doing.''   Louisiana State University speech scientist Ray Daniloff agreedmore people should be studied, but said he reviewed much of theTexas research for the government and concluded ``the data are good.... The methodology is sound.''   ``I think it's good work,'' said University of Connecticut speechscientist Peter J. Alfonso. ``They are probably the only people inthe world using a combination of new brain-imaging techniques toinvestigate stuttering.''   Pool and Aronson agreed the brain abnormalities aren'tnecessarily the direct cause of stuttering and spasmodic dysphonia,and that the abnormalities and speech defects could result from someother ultimate cause.   But because the abnormalities are in parts of the brain believedto control speech, the Texans believe the abnormalities cause theimpediments _ even if they ultimately might be caused by a chemicalflaw in the brain, a gene, injury, tiny strokes or even pollutants,Pool said.</TEXT></DOC>
