But today, thanks to new technology,Ms. Bethiem can type 40 words a minute, using her voice tocontrol a computer from her bed.   With DragonDictate-30K, Ms. Bethiem simply speaks into amicrophone attached to her computer, and everything she saysis transcribed onto the screen. &quot;This has allowed me to havea life. Instead of just surviving, I now feel like I'mparticipating,&quot; she says.</LP><TEXT>   The machine is one of the entries in the Johns HopkinsUniversity 1991 national search for technology to aid thedisabled. Some 1500 students, computer professionals andamateurs entered the quest and participated in one of 10regional fairs held in December.   Thirty of the top entries will compete in a national fairat the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, Feb. 1-2, wherethe winner will receive $10,000.   Paul Hazan, associate director for advanced computing atthe university, says the real winners &quot;are the users who aregoing to get the benefit of all this technology.&quot; With agrant from the National Science Foundation, Mr. Hazandirected the first national search in 1981. &quot;It was likethrowing a match on a bomb,&quot; he says of the explosiveresponse. Some of the winning entries in 1981 were aneyetracking system paraplegics use to activate synthesizedspeech, a printer that utilizes a bicycle inner-tube to printin Braille and a computer for the blind that describes whatappears on screen.   This year, entries range from a system that enablesparaplegics to control appliances by using their eyes tooperate a computer, to a headset that allows the deaf toenjoy live theater.   Andrew Mitz says he used a new computer chip and &quot;a fewthousand dollars of my own&quot; to design WeeTalk, a device tohelp his severely retarded six-year-old son developexpressive language. The device consists of twoswitch-activated, tape-recording channels that a parent ortherapist can use to record the name of two objects. Here'show it works: The therapist mounts a picture of each objecton the corresponding recorder, and the child activates therecording by touching the picture. The goal is for the childto use the system to express what he or she wants.   &quot;As a parent, you give your child every possible chance,and that's why I built (WeeTalk),&quot; says Mr. Mitz, who wonfirst place at the regional fair here at the Johns HopkinsApplied Physics Laboratory.   John Barrus, a Ph.D. student in mechanical engineering atthe Massachusetts Institute of Technology, is giving thedisabled an opportunity to shop from home with a system heand two other students originally created for the elderly.The patent-pending Stylus consists of a box with a speakerand a bar-code scanner that users plug into their phone-jack.Shoppers can phone in grocery orders by scanning a bar-codefilled catalog.   &quot;I think we'll be successful because (Stylus) is sosimple,&quot; says Mr. Barrus, a fifth-place finalist at theregional fair in Boston.   Some of the entries already are being marketed. Janet M.Baker, president of Dragon Systems Inc., says she has soldseveral of the $9,000-DragonDictate systems. &quot;If it allowsthem (the disabled) to go for a job or school, the systempays for itself very quickly,&quot; she says of Dragon Dictate,which adapts to users' pronunciations and recognizes up to30,000 words.   With another voice-operated entry, VOQUEST, a computer canprocess verbal commands such as &quot;open hand&quot; and sendelectrical stimuli to muscles that respond and execute theorders. VOQUEST, which stands for voice-operated quadriplegicelectrical stimulation, &quot;originally set out to givequadriplegics the ability to open and close their hands,&quot;says Dr. Edwin Cooper, an orthopedic surgeon in Kinston,N.C., who helped biomedical engineers at Duke Universitydesign the device.   Although use of VOQUEST is still in developmental stages,Dr. Cooper is conducting research at the Caswell Center inKinston on how electrical stimuli can be used to &quot;awaken&quot;severely retarded and brain-injured patients. &quot;If this thingworks out, we would help mentally and moderately disabledpeople be less dependent on others,&quot; says Di Hahn, arehabilitation engineer at the Caswell Center.   Mr. Hahn, who is pursuing further advances in the device,won second place in Atlanta for his design of a portableVOQUEST.</TEXT></DOC>
