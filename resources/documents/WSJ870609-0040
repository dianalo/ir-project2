Campeau, which acquired Allied for $3.6 billion last year, also said it plans to eliminate Allied's floating-rate debt this year through an asset-sale program and the $500 million financing. Allied had $1.52 billion of floating-rate debt as of March 31.    Campeau, a real estate developer, made the disclosures in its annual report. It didn't elaborate. In March, Allied raised $900 million by selling notes and debentures.    Campeau must dispose of 16 of Allied's 24 retailing chains to meet a $1.1 billion bank obligation by the end of next year. As of April 27, Allied had sold or agreed to sell five divisions for $520 million.    Campeau said that in March, Allied purchased interest-rate protection on $600 million of floating-rate debt. On $500 million of this amount, the company said, it is protected for five years against rates rising above 10%. On the other $100 million, it is protected for four years against rates rising above 11%. </TEXT></DOC>
