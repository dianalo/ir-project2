John Kenneth Peel was acquitted Saturday of eight counts offirst-degree murder and one count of first-degree arson in the 1982deaths aboard the Investor. He had been tried twice; the firsttrial resulted in a hung jury.   ``It's terrible being an innocent man accused of a crime,'' Peelsaid . ``I just thank God it's over. Justice did work this time.''   Peel, a boatbuilder from Bellingham, Wash., who once crewed onthe Investor, was accused of killing skipper Mark Coulthurst, hiswife Irene, two Coulthurst children and four teen-age crew members.The Coulthursts were from Blaine, Wash., and three crew memberswere from the Blaine-Bellingham area.   The Investor was found burning near the southeastern Alaska townof Craig in September 1982, and Peel was not arrested until twoyears after the crime.   ``From the moment it was issued, I have always said theindictment was not worth the paper it was written on,'' saiddefense attorney Phillip Weidner.   ``The prosecutors put an innocent man and his family throughthis ordeal for four years,'' Weidner said, adding that the familyis considering a lawsuit to seek restitution. But he declined tosay who might be the target of such a suit.   On Saturday, Peel, 27, broke into tears and his family cheeredwhen the jury announced its decision in Juneau Superior Court. Hisfamily had been with him throughout the three-month trial, withfinancial support from friends and family in Bellingham.   On the advice of his attorney, Peel did not answer anyquestions. He and his wife, Cathy, declined comment on what theymight do next.   ``We're going to have no place to go but up from here,'' Mrs.Peel said.   Prosecutor Mary Anne Henry, who handled both trials, told jurorsthe state had bungled the Investor investigation, had no evidenceof a motive and no physical evidence against Peel.   Nonetheless, she contended the prosecution could prove its casebased on witnesses who said they saw Peel near the Investor aroundthe time of the killings and in the fishing vessel's skiff afterthe larger boat was found burning in a cove near Craig.   Peel was working on another fishing boat docked in Craig at thetime.   Peel's brother-in-law, Jack Perram, said Peel can return to ajob at Perram's Bellingham boatyard.   ``I'm sort of like a zombie,'' said Peel's mother, Marilyn Peel.``It's been a long three days since the jury went out.''   Relatives of the victims said they were disappointed.   ``Somebody ought to pay,'' said Ted Smith, who was related tofive of those slain. ``I don't say it should have been Peel, but itshould have been somebody.''   ``I thought after being up there for a couple of weeks (watchingthe trial) that they would find him guilty, as they should have,''said Ruth Moon, mother of slain crew member Dean Moon, who was ather home in Bellingham.   The state spent $2 million on the investigation and on Peel'sfirst trial, and budgeted $700,000 for the retrial. The defenserested its case the second time without calling any witnesses.   ``I didn't put a case on because there was no need to dignifythis case by putting on witnesses,'' said Weidner.   Jury deliberations began Wednesday evening. The jury forewomansaid members of the panel had agreed not to talk to reporters.   Peel had been in his parents' custody on a $1 million propertybond since his arrest in September 1984.</TEXT></DOC>
