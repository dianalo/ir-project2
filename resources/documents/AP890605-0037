(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Hungry seals and sea lions are dining onsalmon off Oregon and fish experts say residents are picking up thecheck.   Harbor seals and California sea lions have flourished since thefederal Marine Mammal Protection Act was adopted in 1972, butOregon fishemen say it's time to control the population.   The Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife estimates there are5,000 to 7,000 harbor seals in state waters, double the populationin the mid-1970s. Biologists say the sea lion population hasincreased by one-third since 1972.   The seals and sea lions cruise the river estuaries for salmonreturning from the ocean to spawn.   ``A seal eats about 25 pounds of fish a day,'' wildlifebiologist John Johnson says. ``If you multiply the number of sealsin the bay times 365 days a year, that's a staggering figure.''   Tom Robinson, manager of the Oregon Salmon Commission, says each10-pound chinook represents $75 to Oregon's economy, and eachfive-pound coho represents $35.   ``That's a fairly expensive meal,'' he says.</TEXT></DOC>
