The head of each such agency shallpromulgate such regulations as may be necessary to carry out the amendmentsto this section made by the Rehabilitation, Comprehensive Services, andDevelopmental Disabilities Act of 1978. Copies of any proposed regulationshall be submitted to appropriate authorizing committees of Congress, andsuch regulation may take effect no earlier than the thirtieth day afterthe date on which such regulation is so submitted to such committees.</T3></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="20">(29 U.S.C. 794 (1978 amendment italicized).)</ITAG>On April 4, 1988, the Foundation published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking(NPRM) in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>, 53 FR 10896. The period for receiving publiccomment expired on June 3, 1988. The Foundation received a total of twocomments from national interest organizations and one from an individual.After analysis of these comments, the Foundation decided to adopt thisfinal rule. Section 504 requires that regulations that apply to the programs and activitiesof Federal Executive agencies shall be submitted to the appropriate authorizingcommittees of Congress and that such regulations may take effect no earlierthan the thirtieth day after they have been so submitted. The Foundationis submitting these regulations to the Senate Committee on Labor and HumanResources and its Subcommittee on the Handicapped and to the House Committeeon Education and Labor and its Subcommittee on Select Education. The regulationwill become effective on April 3, 1989. The substantive nondiscrimination obligations of the Foundation, as setforth in this rule, are virtually identical to those established by Federalregulations for programs or activities receiving Federal financial assistance.(<T3>See </T3>28 CFR Part 41 (section 504, coordination regulations forfederally assisted programs).) This general parallelism is in accord withthe intent expressed by supporters of the 1978 amendment in floor debate,including its sponsor, Rep. James M. Jeffords, that the Federal Governmentshould have the same section 504 obligations as recipients of Federal financialassistance. 124 <T3>Cong. Rec. </T3>13,901 (1978) (remarks of Rep. Jeffords); 124 <T3>Cong. Rec. </T3>E2668, E2670 (daily ed. May 17, 1978) <T3>id.; </T3>124 <T3>Cong. Rec. </T3>13,897 (remarks of Rep. Brademas); <T3>id. </T3>at 38,552 (remarks of Rep. Sarasin). Two commenters objected to language differences between this rule and theFederal Government's section 504 regulations for federally assisted programs.As explained in the preamble to the proposed rule, these changes are basedon the Supreme Court's decision in <T3>Southeastern Community College v. Davis, </T3>442 U.S. 397 (1979),and the subsequent circuit court decisions interpreting <T3>Davis </T3>and section 504. <T3>See Dopico v. Goldschmidt, </T3>687 F.2d 644 (2d Cir. 1982); <T3>American Public Transit Association v. Lewis, </T3>655 F.2d 1272 (D.C.Cir. 1981) (<T3>APTA</T3>); <T3>see also Rhode Island Handicapped Action Committee v. Rhode IslandPublic Transit Authority, </T3>718 F.2d 490 (1st Cir. 1983). These language differences are also supported by the recent decision ofthe Supreme Court in <T3>Alexander v. Choate, </T3>469 U.S. 287 (1985), where the Court heldthat the regulations for federally assisted programs did not require arecipient to modify its durational limitation on Medicaid coverage of inpatienthospital care for handicapped persons. Clarifying its <T3>Davis</T3> decision, the Court explained that section 504 requiresonly ``reasonable'' modifications, <T3>id. </T3>at 300, and explicitly noted that ``[t]he regulations implementingsection 504 [for federally assisted programs] are consistent with the viewthat <T3>reasonable </T3>adjustments in the nature of the benefit offered mustat times be made to assure meaningful access.'' <T3>Id. </T3>at 301 n.21 (emphasis added). Incorporation of these changes, therefore, makes this regulation implementingsection 504 for federally conducted programs consistent with the FederalGovernment's section 504 regulations implementing section 504 for federallyassisted programs as they have been interpreted by the Supreme Court. Manyof these federally assisted regulations were issued prior to the interpretationsof section 504 by the Supreme Court in <T3>Davis, </T3>by lower courts interpreting <T3>Davis, </T3>and by the Supreme Court in <T3>Alexander; </T3>therefore their language does not reflect the interpretationof section 504 provided by the Supreme Court and by the various circuitcourts. Of course, these federally assisted regulations must be interpretedto reflect the holdings of the Federal judiciary. Hence the Foundationbelieves that there are no significant differences between this rule forfederally conducted programs and the Federal Government's interpretationof section 504 regulations for federally assisted programs. This regulation has been reviewed by the Department of Justice. This regulationis an adaptation of a prototype prepared by the Department of Justice underExecutive Order 12250 (45 FR 72995, 3 CFR, 1980 Comp., p. 298) and distributedto Executive agencies. This regulation has also been reviewed by the EqualEmployment Opportunity Commission under Executive Order 12067 (43 FR 28967,3 CFR, 1978 Comp., p. 206). It is not a major rule within the meaning of Executive Order 12291 (46FR 13193, 3 CFR, 1981 Comp., p. 127) and therefore, a regulatory impactanalysis has not been prepared. This regulation does not have an impact on small entities. It is not, therefore,subject to the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601-612). <ITAG tagnum="84">Section-by-Section Analysis and Response to Comments </ITAG>Section 606.1 Purpose Section 606.1 states the purpose of the rule, which is to effectuate section119 of the Rehabilitation, Comprehensive Services, and Developmental DisabilitiesAmendments of 1978, which amended section 504 of the Rehabilitation Actof 2973 to prohibit discrimination on the basis of handicap in programsor activities conducted by Executive agencies or the United States PostalService.Section 606.2 Application The regulation applies to all programs or activities conducted by the Foundationbut not programs or activities conducted by recipients of Federal financialassistance from the Foundation. Under this section, a federally conductedprogram or activity is, in simple terms, anything a Federal agency does.Aside from employment, there are two major categories of federally conductedprograms or activities covered by this regulation: Those involving generalpublic contact as part of ongoing Foundation operations and those directlyadministered by the Foundation for program beneficiaries and participants.Activities in the first category include communication with the public(telephone contacts, office walk-ins, or interviews) and the public's useof the Foundation's facilities. Activities in the second category includeprograms that provide Federal services or benefits. This regulation doesnot, however, apply to programs or activities conducted outside the UnitedStates that do not involve individuals with handicaps in the United States.Section 606.3 Definitions ``Assistant Attorney General.'' ``Assistant Attorney General'' refers tothe Assistant Attorney General, Civil Rights Division, United States Departmentof Justice. ``Auxiliary aids.'' ``Auxiliary aids'' means services or devices that enablepersons with impaired sensory, manual, or speaking skills to have an equalopportunity to participate in and enjoy the benefits of the Foundation'sprograms or activities. The definition provides examples of commonly usedauxiliary aids. Although auxiliary aids are required explicitly only byandSection; 606.60(a)(1), they may also be necessary to meet other requirementsof the regulation. A commenter suggested that the requirement for auxiliary aids in aspectsof the Foundation's program other than those covered by andSection; 606.60(a)(1)should be specifically stated in the regulation. The Foundation believesthat such a statement is unnecessary, because the regulation makes theobligation not to discriminate clear and thus requires the provision ofauxiliary aids whenever they are necessary to meet that obligation. Twocommenters suggested that ``attendant services'' should be included inthe list of examples of auxiliary aids appearing in the definition. TheFoundation believes that attendant services are generally personal in natureand that they are therefore generally not required. ``Complete complaint.'' ``Complete complaint'' is defined to include allthe information necessary to enable the Foundation to investigate the complaint.The definition is necessary, because the 180-day period for the Foundation'sinvestigation (<T3>see </T3>andSection; 606.70(f)) begins when the Foundation receives acomplete complaint. ``Facility.'' The definition of ``facility'' is similar to that in thesection 504 coordination regulation for federally assisted programs (28CFR 41.3(f)) except that the term ``rolling stock or other conveyances''has been added. The other exception is that the phrase, ``or interest insuch property,'' has been deleted because the term ``facility,'' as usedin this regulation, refers to structures and not to intangible propertyrights. It should, however, be noted that the regulation applies to allprograms and activities conducted by the Foundation regardless of whetherthe facility in which they are conducted is owned, leased, or used on someother basis by the Foundation. The term ``facility'' is used in andSection;andSection;606.50, 606.51, and 606.70(e). ``Individual with handicaps.'' The definition of ``individual with handicaps''is identical to the definition of ``handicapped person'' appearing in thesection 504 coordination regulation for federally assisted programs (28CFR 41.31). Although section 103(d) of the Rehabilitation Act Amendmentsof 1986 changed the statutory term ``handicapped individual'' to ``individualwith handicaps,'' the legislative history of this amendment indicates thatno substantive change was intended. Thus, although the term has been changedin the regulation to be consistent with the statute as amended, the definitionis unchanged. In particular, although the term as revised refers to ``handicaps''in the plural, it does not exclude persons who have only one handicap.``Qualified individual with handicaps.'' The definition of ``qualifiedindividual with handicaps'' is a revised version of the definition of ``qualifiedhandicapped person'' appearing in the section 504 coordination regulationsfor federally assisted programs (28 CFR 41.32). Paragraph (1) deviates from existing regulations for federally assistedprograms because of intervening court decisions. It defines ``qualifiedindividual with handicaps'' with regard to any program under which a personis required to perform services or to achieve a level of accomplishment.In such programs a qualified individual with handicaps is one who can achievethe purpose of the program without modifications in the program that theFoundation can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration inits nature. This definition reflects the decision of the Supreme Courtin <T3>Southeastern Community College v. Davis, </T3>442 U.S. 397 (1979).In that case, the Court ruled that a hearing-impaired applicant to a nursingschool was not a ``qualified handicapped person'' because her hearing impairmentwould prevent her from participating in the clinical training portion ofthe program. The Court found that, if the program were modified so as toenable the respondent to participate (by exempting her from the clinicaltraining requirements), ``she would not receive even a rough equivalentof the training a nursing program normally gives.'' <T3>Id. </T3>at 410. It also found that ``the purpose of [the] programwas to train persons who could serve the nursing profession in all customaryways,'' <T3>id. </T3>at 413, and that the respondent: would be unable, becauseof her hearing impairment, to perform some functions expected of a registerednurse. It therefore concluded that the school was not required by section504 to make such modifications that would result in ``a fundamental alterationin the nature of the program.'' <T3>Id. </T3>at 410. We have incorporated the Court's language in the definition of ``qualifiedindividual with handicaps'' in order to make clear that such a person mustbe able to participate in the program offered by the Foundation. The Foundationis required to make modifications in order to enable an applicant withhandicaps to participate, but is not required to offer a program of a fundamentallydifferent nature. The test is whether, with appropriate modifications,the applicant can achieve the purpose of the program offered; not whetherthe applicant could benefit or obtain results from some other program thatthe Foundation does not offer. Although the revised definition allows exclusionof some individuals with handicaps from some programs, it requires thatan individual with handicaps who is capable of achieving the purpose ofthe program must be accommodated, provided that the modifications do notfundamentally alter the nature of the program. Two commenters argued that this definition of ``qualified individual withhandicaps'' was unnecessary, because <T3>Davis </T3>was an interpretation of the definition in paragraph (2),which requires only that the individual meet ``the essential eligibilityrequirements'' for participation in the program. The Foundation believesthat <T3>Davis </T3>clarifies the meaning of ``essential eligibility requirements''with respect to programs, such as the one at issue in that case, in whichan individual ``is required to perform services or to achieve a level ofaccomplishment.'' In such a program, the Court held in <T3>Davis, </T3>an individual is not qualified if he or she cannot achievethe purpose of the program without modifications that would fundamentallyalter its nature. The Foundation believes that it is appropriate to reflectthis clarification in the regulation. A commenter also suggested that the rule rather than the preamble shouldaddress when modifications to a program must occur. The Foundation believesthat the obligation to make appropriate modifications or adjustments toenable individuals with handicaps to participate in its programs is madesufficiently clear in the substantive provisions of the regulation, sothat a reference to it in this definition is unnecessary.The Foundation has the initial burden of demonstrating that a proposedmodification would constitute a fundamental alteration in the nature ofits program or activity. Furthermore, in demonstrating that a modificationwould result in such an alteration, the Foundation must follow the proceduresestablished in andSection; 606.51(a) and andSection; 606.60(d), which are discussedbelow, for demonstrating that an action would result in undue financialand administrative burdens. That is, the decision must be made by the FoundationDirector or his or her designee in writing after consideration of all resourcesavailable for the program or activity and must be accompanied by an explanationof the reasons for the decision. If the Foundation Director or his or herdesignee determines that an action would result in a fundamental alteration,the Foundation must consider options that would enable the individual withhandicaps to achieve the purpose of the program but would not result insuch an alteration. For programs or activities that do not fall under the first paragraph,paragraph (2) adopts the existing definition of ``qualified handicappedperson'' with respect to services (28 CFR 41.32(b)) in the coordinationregulation for programs receiving Federal financial assistance. Under thisdefinition, a qualified individual with handicaps is an individual withhandicaps who meets the essential eligibility requirements for participationin the program or activity. Paragraph (3) explains that ``qualified individual with handicaps'' means``qualified handicapped person'' as that term is defined for purposes ofemployment in the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission's regulationat 29 CFR 1613.702(f), which is made applicable to this part by andSection;606.40. Nothing in this part changes existing regulations applicable toemployment. ``Section 504.'' This definition makes clear that, as used in this regulation,``section 504'' applies only to programs or activities conducted by theFoundation and not to programs or activities to which it provides Federalfinancial assistance. Section 606.10 Self-evaluation The Foundation shall conduct a self-evaluation of its compliance with section504 within one year of the effective date of this regulation. The self-evaluationrequirement is present in the existing section 504 coordination regulationfor programs or activities receiving Federal financial assistance (28 CFR41.5(b)(2)). Experience has demonstrated the self-evaluation process tobe a valuable means of establishing a working relationship with individualswith handicaps that promotes both effective and efficient implementationof section 504. One commenter suggested that among the post-evaluation material to be placedon file and made available to the public should be a list of the interestedpersons who provided comments during the self-evaluation. That list hasbeen added at andSection; 606.10(c)(1). Section 606.11 Notice Section 606.11 requires the Foundation to disseminate sufficient informationto employees, applicants, participants, beneficiaries, and other interestedpersons to apprise them of rights and protections afforded by section 504and this regulation. Methods of providing this information include, forexample, the publication of information in handbooks, manuals, and pamphletsthat are distributed to the public to describe the Foundation's programsand activities; the display of informative posters in service centers andother public places; or the broadcast of information by television or radio.A commenter suggested that this provision be amended to include recruitmentmaterials. Because this provision specifically mentions information availableto ``applicants . . . and other interested persons,'' the Foundation believesthat recruitment information is already adequately covered by the noticeprovision, and for this reason this suggestion has not been adopted. Section 606.30 General prohibitions against discrimination Section 606.30 is an adaptation of the corresponding section of the section504 coordination regulation for programs or activities receiving Federalfinancial assistance (28 CFR 41.51). Paragraph (a) restates the nondiscrimination mandate of section 504. Theremaining paragraphs in andSection; 606.30 establish the general principlesfor analyzing whether any particular action of the Foundation violatesthis mandate. These principles serve as the analytical foundation for theremaining sections of the regulation. If the Foundation violates a provisionin any of the subsequent sections, it will also violate one of the generalprohibitions found in andSection; 606.30. When there is no applicable subsequentprovision, the general prohibitions stated in this section apply. Paragraph (b) prohibits overt denials of equal treatment of individualswith handicaps. The Foundation may not refuse to provide an individualwith handicaps with an equal opportunity to participate in or benefit fromits program simply because the person is handicapped. Such blatantly exclusionarypractices often result from the use of irrebuttable presumptions that absolutelyexclude certain classes of disabled persons (<T3>e.g., </T3>epileptics, hearing-impaired persons, persons with heartailments) from participation in programs or activities without regard toan individual's actual ability to participate. Use of an irrebuttable presumptionis permissible only when in all cases a physical condition by its verynature would prevent an individual from meeting the essential eligibilityrequirements for participation in the activity in question. It would bepermissible, therefore, to exclude without an individual evaluation allpersons who are blind in both eyes from eligibility for a license to operatea commercial vehicle in interstate commerce; but it may not be permissibleto automatically disqualify all those who are blind in just one eye. In addition, section 504 prohibits more than just the most obvious denialsof equal treatment. It is not enough to admit persons in wheelchairs toa program if the facilities in which the program is conducted are inaccessible.Paragraph (b)(1)(iii), therefore, requires that the opportunity to participateor benefit afforded to an individual with handicaps be as effective asthat afforded to others. The later sections on program accessibility (andSection;andSection;606.50-606.52) and communications (andSection; 606.60) are specific applicationsof this principle. Despite the mandate of paragraph (d) that the Foundation administer itsprograms and activities in the most integrated setting appropriate to theneeds of qualified individuals with handicaps, paragraph (b)(1)(iv), inconjunction with paragraph (d), permits the Foundation to develop separateor different aids, benefits, or services when necessary to provide individualswith handicaps with an equal opportunity to participate in or benefit fromthe Foundation's programs or activities. Paragraph (b)(1)(iv) requiresthat different or separate aids, benefits, or services be provided onlywhen necessary to ensure that the aids, benefits, or services are as effectiveas those provided to others. Even when separate or different aids, benefits,or services would be more effective, paragraph (b)(2) provides that a qualifiedindividual with handicaps still has the right to choose to participatein the program that is not designed to accommodate individuals with handicaps. Paragraph (b)(1)(v) prohibits the Foundation from denying a qualifiedindividual with handicaps the opportunity to participate as a member ofa planning or advisory board. Paragraph (b)(1)(vi) prohibits the Foundation from limiting a qualifiedindividual with handicaps in the enjoyment of any right, privilege, advantage,or opportunity enjoyed by others receiving any aid, benefit, or service. Paragraph (b)(3) prohibits the Foundation from utilizing criteria or methodsof administration that deny individuals with handicaps access to the Foundation'sprograms or activities. The phrase ``criteria or methods of administration''refers to official written Foundation policies and the actual practicesof the Foundation. This paragraph prohibits both blatantly exclusionarypolicies or practices and nonessential policies and practices that areneutral on their face, but deny individuals with handicaps an effectiveopportunity to participate. Paragraph (b)(4) specifically applies the prohibition enunciated in andSection;606.30(b)(3) to the process of selecting sites for construction of newfacilities or selecting existing facilities to be used by the Foundation.Paragraph (b)(4) does not apply to construction of additional buildingsat an existing site. Paragraph (b)(5) prohibits the Foundation, in the selection of procurementcontractors, from using criteria that subject qualified individuals withhandicaps to discrimination on the basis of handicap. One commenter objected to the omission of a paragraph from the regulationfor federally assisted programs that prohibits a recipient from providingsignificant assistance to an organization that discriminates. To the extentthat assistance from the Foundation would provide significant support toan organization, it would constitute Federal financial assistance and theorganization, as a recipient of such assistance, would be covered by theFoundation's section 504 regulation for federally assisted programs. Theregulatory ``significant assistance'' provision, however, would be inappropriatein a regulation applying only to federally conducted programs or activities. Paragraph (c) provides that programs conducted pursuant to Federal statuteor Executive order that are designed to benefit only individuals with handicapsor a given class of individuals with handicaps may be limited to thoseindividuals with handicaps. Paragraph (d), discussed above, provides that the Foundation must administerprograms and activities in the most integrated setting appropriate to theneeds of qualified individuals with handicaps, <T3>i.e., </T3>in a setting that enables individuals with handicaps tointeract with nonhandicapped persons to the fullest extent possible.Section 606.40 EmploymentSection 606.40 prohibits discrimination on the basis of handicap in employmentby the Foundation. Courts have held that section 504, as amended in 1978,covers the employment practices of Executive agencies. <T3>Gardner v. Morris</T3>, 752 F.2d 1271, 1277 (8th Cir. 1985); <T3>Smith v. United States Postal Service</T3>, 742 F.2d 257, 259-260 (6thCir. 1984); <T3>Prewitt v. United States Postal Service</T3>, 662 F.2d 292, 302-04(5th Cir. 1981). <T3>Contra McGuiness v. United States Postal Service</T3>, 744 F.2d 1318,1320-21 (7th Cir. 1984); <T3>Boyd v. United States Postal Service</T3>, 752 F.2d 410, 413-14 (9thCir. 1985).Courts uniformly have held that in order to give effect to section 501of the Rehabilitation Act, which covers Federal employment, the administrativeprocedures of section 501 must be followed in processing complaints ofemployment discrimination under section 504. <T3>Smith</T3>, 742 F.2d at 262; <T3>Prewitt</T3>, 662 F.2d at 304. Accordingly, andSection; 606.40 (Employment)of this rule adopts the definitions, requirements, and procedures of section501 as established in regulations of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission(EEOC) at 29 CFR Part 1613. Responsibility for coordinating enforcementof Federal laws prohibiting discrimination in employment is assigned tothe EEOC by Executive Order 12067 (3 CFR, 1978 Comp., p. 206). Under thisauthority, the EEOC establishes government-wide standards on nondiscriminationin employment on the basis of handicap. In addition to this section, andSection;606.70(b) specifies that the Foundation will use the existing EEOC proceduresto resolve allegations of employment discrimination.Section 606.50 Program accessibility: Discrimination prohibited Section 606.50 states the general nondiscrimination principle underlyingthe program accessibility requirements of andSection;andSection; 606.51 and606.52. Section 606.51 Program accessibility: Existing facilities This regulation adopts the program accessibility concept found in the existingandSection; 504 coordination regulation for programs or activities receivingFederal financial assistance (28 CFR 41.57), with certain modifications.Thus, andSection; 606.51 requires that each Foundation program or activity,when viewed in its entirety, be readily accessible to and usable by individualswith handicaps. The regulation also makes clear that the Foundation isnot required to make each of its existing facilities accessible (andSection;606.51(a)(1)). However, andSection; 606.51, unlike 28 CFR 41.57, places explicitlimits on the Foundation's obligation to ensure program accessibility (andSection;606.51(a)(2)). Paragraph (a)(2) generally codifies case law that defines the scope ofthe Foundation's obligation to ensure program accessibility. This paragraphprovides that in meeting the program accessibility requirement the Foundationis not required to take any action that would result in a fundamental alterationin the nature of its program or activity or in undue financial and administrativeburdens. A similar limitation is provided in andSection; 606.60(d). Thisprovision is based on the Supreme Court's holding in <T3>Southeastern Community College v. Davis, </T3>442 U.S. 397 (1979),that section 504 does not require program modifications that result ina fundamental alteration in the nature of the program, and on the Court'sstatement that section 504 does not require modifications that would resultin ``undue financial and administrative burdens.'' 442 U.S. at 412. Since<T3>Davis, </T3>circuit courts have applied this limitation on a showingthat only one of the two ``undue burdens'' would be created as a resultof the modification sought to be imposed under section 504. <T3>See, e.g., Dopico v. Goldschmidt, </T3>687 F.2d 644 (2d Cir. 1982);<T3>American Public Transit Association v. Lewis, (APTA), </T3>655 F.2d1272 (D.C. Cir. 1981). Paragraphs (a)(2) and 606.60(d) are also supported by the Supreme Court'srecent decision in <T3>Alexander v. Choate, </T3>469 U.S. 287 (1985). <T3>Alexander </T3>involved a challenge to the State of Tennessee's reductionof inpatient hospital care coverage under Medicaid from 20 to 14 days peryear. Plaintiffs argued that this reduction violated section 504 becauseit had an adverse impact on handicapped persons. The Court assumed withoutdeciding that andSection; 504 reaches at least some conduct that has an unjustifiabledisparate impact on handicapped people, but held that the reduction wasnot ``the sort of disparate impact'' discrimination that might be prohibitedby section 504 or its implementing regulation. <T3>Id. </T3>at 299. Relying on <T3>Davis, </T3>the Court said that section 504 guarantees qualified handicappedpersons ``meaningful access to the benefits that the grantee offers,''<T3>id. </T3>at 301, and that ``<T3>reasonable adjustments </T3>in the nature of the benefit being offeredmust at times be made to assure meaningful access.'' <T3>Id. </T3>at n.21 (emphasis added). However, section 504 does not require`` `changes,' `adjustments,' or `modifications' to existing programs thatwould be `substantial' * * * or that would constitute `fundamental alteration(s)in the nature of a program.' '' <T3>Id. </T3>at n.20 (citations omitted). <T3>Alexander </T3>supports the position, based on <T3>Davis </T3>and the earlier, lower court decisions, that in some situations,certain accommodations for a handicapped person may so alter an agency'sprogram or activity, or entail such extensive costs and administrativeburdens that the refusal to undertake the accommodations is not discriminatory.Thus, failure to include such an ``undue burdens'' provision could leadto judicial invalidation of the regulation or reversal of a particularenforcement action taken pursuant to the regulation. This paragraph, however, does not establish an absolute defense; it doesnot relieve the Foundation of all obligations to individuals with handicaps.Although the Foundation is not required to take actions that would resultin a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or activity or inundue financial and administrative burdens, it nevertheless must take anyother steps necessary to ensure that individuals with handicaps receivethe benefits and services of the federally conducted program or activity.It is our view that compliance with andSection; 606.51(a) would in most casesnot result in undue financial and administrative burdens on the Foundation.In determining whether financial and administrative burdens are undue,all Foundation resources available for use in the funding and operationof the conducted program or activity should be considered. The initialburden of establishing that compliance with andSection; 606.51(a) would fundamentallyalter the nature of a program or activity or would result in undue financialand administrative burdens rests with the Foundation. The decision thatcompliance would result in such alteration or burdens must be made by theFoundation Director or his or her designee and must be accompanied by awritten statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion. Any personwho believes that he or she or any specific class of persons has been injuredby the Foundation's decision or failure to make a decision may file a complaintunder the compliance procedures established in andSection; 606.70.Two commenters argued that the decision that an action would result inundue burdens should be based on the resources of the Foundation as a whole.The Foundation believes that its entire budget is an inappropriate touchstonefor making determinations as to undue financial and administrative burdens.Parts of the Foundation's budget may be earmarked for specific purposesand may simply not be available for use in making the Foundation's programsaccessible to individuals with handicaps. Paragraph (b) sets forth a number of means by which program accessibilitymay be achieved, including redesign of equipment, reassignment of servicesto accessible buildings, and provision of aides. In choosing among methods,the Foundation shall give priority consideration to those that will beconsistent with provision of services in the most integrated setting appropriateto the needs of individuals with handicaps. Structural changes in existingfacilities are required only when there is no other feasible way to makethe Foundation's program accessible. (It should be noted that ``structuralchanges'' include all physical changes to a facility; the term does notrefer only to changes to structural features, such as removal of or alterationsto a load-bearing structural member.) The Foundation may comply with theprogram accessibility requirement by delivering services at alternate accessiblesites or making home visits as appropriate. Paragraphs (c) and (d) establish time periods for complying with the programaccessibility requirements. As currently required for federally assistedprograms by 28 CFR 41.57(b), the Foundation must make any necessary structuralchanges in facilities as soon as practicable, but in no event later thanthree years after the effective date of this regulation. Where structuralmodifications are required, a transition plan shall be developed withinsix months of the effective date of this regulation. Aside from structuralchanges, all other necessary steps to achieve compliance shall be takenwithin 60 days. Section 606.52 Program accessibility: New construction and alterationsOverlapping coverage exists with respect to new construction and alterationsunder section 504 and the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968, as amended(42 U.S.C. 4151-4157). Section 606.52 provides that those buildings thatare constructed or altered by, on behalf of, or for the use of the Foundationshall be designed, constructed, or altered to be readily accessible toand usable by individuals with handicaps in accordance with 41 CFR 101-19.600to 101-19.607. This standard was promulgated pursuant to the ArchitecturalBarriers Act of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157). We believe thatit is appropriate to adopt the existing Architectural Barriers Act standardfor section 504 compliance because new and altered buildings subject tothis regulation are also subject to the Architectural Barriers Act andbecause adoption of the standard will avoid duplicative and possibly inconsistentstandards. Existing buildings leased by the Foundation after the effective date ofthis regulation are not required by the regulation to meet accessibilitystandards simply by virtue of being leased. They are subject, however,to the program accessibility standard for existing facilities in andSection;606.51. To the extent the buildings are newly constructed or altered, theymust also meet the new construction and alteration requirements of andSection;606.52. Federal practice under section 504 has always treated newly leased buildingsas subject to the existing facility program accessibility standard. Unlikethe construction of new buildings where architectural barriers can be avoidedat little or no cost, the application of new construction standards toan existing building being leased raises the same prospect of retrofittingbuildings as the use of an existing Federal facility, and the Foundationbelieves the same program accessibility standard should apply to both ownedand leased existing buildings. In <T3>Rose v. United States Postal Service, </T3>774 F.2d 1355 (9th Cir.1985), the Ninth Circuit held that the Architectural Barriers Act requiresaccessibility at the time of lease. The <T3>Rose </T3>court did not address the issue of whether section 504 likewiserequires accessibility as a condition of lease, and the case was remandedto the District Court for among other things, consideration of that issue.The Foundation may provide more specific guidance on section 504 requirementsfor leased buildings after the litigation is completed. Section 606.60 Communications Section 606.60 requires the Foundation to take appropriate steps to ensureeffective communication with personnel of other Federal entities, applicants,participants, and members of the public. These steps shall include proceduresfor determining when auxiliary aids are necessary under andSection; 606.60(a)(1)to afford an individual with handicaps an equal opportunity to participatein, and enjoy the benefits of, the Foundation's program or activity. Theyshall also include an opportunity for individuals with handicaps to requestthe auxiliary aids of their choice. This expressed choice shall be givenspecial consideration by the Foundation (andSection; 606.60(a)(2)(i)). TheFoundation shall honor the choice unless it can demonstrate that anothereffective means of communication exists or that use of the means chosenwould not be required under andSection; 606.60(d). That paragraph limitsthe obligation of the Foundation to ensure effective communication in accordancewith <T3>Davis </T3>and the circuit court opinions interpreting it (<T3>see supra </T3>preamble discussion of andSection; 606.51(a)(2)). Unlessnot required by andSection; 606.60(d), the Foundation shall provide auxiliaryaids at no cost to the individual with handicaps. The discussion of andSection; 606.51(a), Program accessibility: Existingfacilities, regarding the determination of undue financial and administrativeburdens also applies to this section and should be referred to for a completeunderstanding of the Foundation's obligation to comply with andSection; 606.60.In certain circumstances, such as relatively simple requests for informationby persons skilled in spoken or written language, a note pad and writtenmaterials may be sufficient to permit effective communication with a hearing-impairedperson. In many circumstances, however, they may not be, particularly whenthe information being communicated is complex or exchanged for a lengthyperiod of time (<T3>e.g., </T3>a meeting) or where the hearing-impaired applicant or participantis not skilled in spoken or written language and the potential for misunderstandingis high. Then a sign language interpreter may be appropriate. For vision-impairedpersons, effective communication might be achieved by several means, includingreaders and audio recordings. In general, the Foundation intends to informthe public of (1) the communications services it offers to afford individualswith handicaps an equal opportunity to participate in or benefit from itsprograms or activities, (2) the opportunity to request a particular modeof communication, and (3) the Foundation's preferences regarding auxiliaryaids if it can demonstrate that several different modes are effective.The Foundation shall ensure effective communication with vision-impairedand hearing-impaired persons involved in hearings conducted by the Foundation.Auxiliary aids must be afforded where necessary to ensure effective communicationat the proceedings. If sign language interpreters are necessary, the Foundationmay require that it be given reasonable notice prior to the proceedingof the need for an interpreter. Moreover, the Foundation need not provideindividually prescribed devices, readers for personal use or study, orother devices of a personal nature (andSection; 606.60(a)(1)(ii)). For example,the Foundation need not provide eye glasses or hearing aids to applicantsor participants in its programs. Similarly, the regulation does not requirethe Foundation to provide wheelchairs to persons with mobility impairments.Paragraph (b) requires the Foundation to provide information to individualswith handicaps concerning accessible services, activities, and facilities.Paragraph (c) requires the Foundation to provide signage at inaccessiblefacilities that directs users to locations with information about accessiblefacilities.One commenter recommended that the Foundation add a paragraph to andSection;606.60, Communications, requiring the agency to provide handicapped personswith information about their rights under section 504. Such a paragraphis unnecessary because it would duplicate andSection; 606.11, Notice. One commenter suggested that the Foundation add a paragraph to andSection;606.60, Communications, requiring the Foundation to provide captioningon films and videotapes that it produces. The regulation requires thatthe Foundation ensure that communications with hearing-impaired personsbe effective. Although the captioning of films and videotapes is one meansof ensuring effective communications, there are other, equally effectivealternatives available. For this reason the Foundation has not adoptedthis suggestion. Section 606.70 Complaint procedures Paragraph (a) specifies that paragraphs (c) through (h) of this sectionestablish the procedures for processing complaints other than employmentcomplaints. Paragraph (b) provides that the agency will process employmentcomplaints according to procedures established in existing regulationsof the EEOC (29 CFR Part 1613) pursuant to section 501 of the RehabilitationAct of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 791). Paragraph (c) designates the official responsible for coordinating implementationof andSection; 606.70 and paragraph (d) provides an address to which complaintsmay be sent. The Foundation is required to accept and investigate all complete complaints(andSection; 606.70(d)). If it determines that it does not have jurisdictionover a complaint, it shall promptly notify the complainant and make reasonableefforts to refer the complaint to the appropriate entity of the FederalGovernment (andSection; 606.70(d)). One commenter on the compliance procedures suggested that the Foundationshould be required to refer a complaint to the appropriate agency whenthe Foundation does not have jurisdiction over it. The proposed rule merelyrequired the Foundation to make reasonable efforts to do so. The Foundationhas not adopted this suggestion because of several possible circumstancesin which the Foundation might not be able to refer a complaint successfully.For example, the Foundation might receive a complaint that no Federal agencywould have jurisdiction over or that did not contain sufficient informationto identify the appropriate agency. A commenter suggested that the regulation should include procedures forhandling complaints that are incomplete. The Foundation believes that itis not necessary to include such detailed procedures in the text of theregulation itself. The Foundation will, of course, develop methods forhandling situations for which procedures are not spelled out in the regulation.Section 606.70(e) requires the Foundation to notify the Architectural andTransportation Barriers Compliance Board upon receipt of a complaint allegingthat a building or facility subject to the Architectural Barriers Act wasdesigned, constructed, or altered in a manner that does not provide readyaccess to and use by individuals with handicaps. Section 606.70(f) requires the Foundation to provide to the complainant,in writing, findings of fact and conclusions of law, the relief grantedif noncompliance is found, and notice of the right to appeal. One appealwithin the Foundation shall be provided (andSection; 606.70(g)). The appealwill not be heard by the same person who made the initial determinationof compliance or noncompliance (andSection; 606.70(g)). Two commenters suggested that the rule should incorporate a provision concerningjudicial review, and one commenter suggested that the rule should statethat a complainant is not required to exhaust the administrative remediesbefore bringing an action in court. It is beyond the Foundation's jurisdictionto specify the availability or scope of judicial review of agency actions.That issue is for the courts to decide. One commenter requested the addition of a provision whereby the Foundationwould award attorneys fees to complainants and two commenters requestedthe addition of a provision whereby compensation would be awarded to theprevailing parties in administrative proceedings. There is no general authorizationin title V of the Rehabilitation Act for the agency award of attorney feesin agency administrative proceedings, or for the payment of compensationto prevailing parties in agency proceedings. For this reason the Foundationhas not adopted either an attorneys fee provision or a compensation provisionin the final regulation. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 45 CFR Part 606 </ITAG>Blind, Buildings, Civil rights, Employment, Equal employment opportunity,Federal buildings and facilities, Government employees, Handicapped. <ITAG tagnum="6">Erich Bloch, </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Director, National Science Foundation.</ITAG>For the reasons set forth in the preamble, Title 45, Public Welfare, ofthe Code of Federal Regulations is amended by adding Part 606 as follows:<ITAG tagnum="56">PART 606_ENFORCEMENT OF NONDISCRIMINATION ON THE BASIS OF HANDICAPIN PROGRAMS OR ACTIVITIES CONDUCTED BY THE NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="70">Sec. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">606.1 Purpose. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">606.2 Application. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">606.3 Definitions. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">606.4-606.9 [Reserved] </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">606.10 Self-evaluation. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">606.11 Notice. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">606.12-606.29 [Reserved] </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">606.30 General prohibitions against discrimination. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">606.31-606.39 [Reserved] </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">606.40 Employment. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">606.41-606.49 [Reserved] </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">606.50 Program accessibility: Discrimination prohibited. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">606.51 Program accessibility: Existing facilities. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">606.52 Program accessibility: New construction and alterations. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">606.53-606.59 [Reserved] </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">606.60 Communications. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">606.61-606.69 [Reserved] </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">606.70 Complaint procedures_general. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">606.71_606.99 [Reserved]</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority: </T4>29 U.S.C. 794. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 606.1 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Purpose. </ITAG>The purpose of this part is to effectuate section 119 of the Rehabilitation,Comprehensive Services, and Developmental Disabilities Amendments of 1978,which amended section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 to prohibitdiscrimination on the basis of handicap in programs or activities conductedby Executive agencies or the United States Postal Service. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 606.2 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Application. </ITAG>This part applies to all programs or activities conducted by the Foundation,except for programs or activities conducted outside the United States thatdo not involve individuals with handicaps in the United States.
