SCHAFER</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The idea of deploying America's military forceson the nation's streets to battle the scourge of drugs may be fodderfor headlines and congressional demands, but Pentagon officialspoint out there are strict legal limitations on such a thing.   ``It just makes hair stand on end here,'' said one seniorPentagon official. ``Our primary mission is to prepare for anypossible military threat _ not to be a national police force. ...There's been a lot of very loose talk about expanding our role.''   To counter assumptions that U.S. troops could be used to patrolthe streets and nab drug dealers, Pentagon officials point to alittle-known law that prevents active duty troops from acting as lawenforcement officers within the nation's borders.   It is known as the Posse Comitatus Act and was passed by Congressin 1878 as a post-Civil War reaction to the use of federal troops inenforcing the Reconstruction Acts.   Because it deals with the enforcement of domestic law, the lawdoes not affect U.S. forces overseas.   David Super, a Defense Department spokesman, said that while itmay be enticing to think of the nation's military might as a machineto be turned against drug king pins, the ramifications have to betaken into account.   ``It's really a rather profound idea when you think about it,''he said. ``Posse Comitatus is a reflection on our free society.There are a lot of countries where the military is used to policethe streets, but they aren't much fun to live in.''   According to a common legal definition, the term ``possecomitatus'' means the power of the county and refers to theauthority of the sheriff to call to his aid the male populationabove the age of 15 to in capturing escaped felons and keeping thepeace.   In effect, the law is interpreted to mean that military forces _the Army, Air Force, Navy and Marines and their respective reserves_ may be used in a support role for the battle against drugs, suchas aiding in surveillance or interdiction efforts.   But they are prevented from adopting the role of law enforcementofficials, tasks assigned to the local police or other officials,such as from the Drug Enforcement Agency.   For example, the military may provide boats to help interdictdrug traffickers, or radar surveillance to spot a drug-transportingplane, but it is up to civilian law enforcement officials to seizeevidence, make arrests, and testify in court.   The law does not affect a state's National Guard when units areunder the control of its governor, but the laws in each state vary,said Robert Dunlap, a spokesman for the National Guard Bureau.   The National Guard Bureau is the Defense Department agency thatserves as a coordinating body for the Guard forces in the variousstates.   It is National Guard Bureau policy that its members ``not betasked'' with enforcing civil law, officials point out.   ``It's important, because we just don't have the training _ we'renot trained to do police work,'' Dunlap said.   Dunlap said Guard units have been involved in helping localofficials support drug interdiction efforts since 1977, and since1983 has been involved on the federal level.   In fact, the role of the Guard has been expanded in 21 states toallow them to aid Customs officials in cargo inspections for illicitdrugs, Super said.   ``Guardsmen are happy to be involved. ... Guardsmen are allvolunteers and part of the community they serve. But our proper roleis in support of civilian law enforcement officials,'' Dunlap said.   Congress has been pressing the Pentagon to become more active onthe home front in the war against drugs, despite concerns among themilitary brass about draining resources from their traditionaldefense mission.   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney is slated to outlined an expandedmilitary role this week. The secretary's plan is not expected tocall for an enforcement role for the military, but rather emphasizeincreased interdiction and radar surveillance methods, among otherthings.</TEXT></DOC>
