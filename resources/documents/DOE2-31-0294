The recent advances in geneticengineering technology have made it possible to design new genetic approachesfor the development of improved methanogens for methane generation. Inorder to apply this new technology to the methanogens, the constructionof suitable cloning vectors for the transformation of the desired methanogensis essential. An effective cloning vector should contain at least twoelements: a replication origin and a gene to serve as a selection marker.One of the efforts is to develop suitable selection markers for the establishmentof transformation systems for the desired methanogens. Recently the authorhas been able to demonstrate that the bacterial kanamycin resistancegene can be an excellent selection marker for the development of transformationsystems for some of the methanogens. Efforts have been made towards theconstruction of effective kanamycin resistance gene based cloning vectorsfor genetic engineering of the methanogens. 14 references, 8 figures.</TEXT></DOC>
