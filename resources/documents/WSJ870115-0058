More high tech, more cars  </DATELINE><TEXT>    evenpianos.   Faced with growing competition from less-developed nations in textiles, steel and shipbuilding, South Korea aims for growth in construction equipment, integrated circuits, telecommunications and medical equipment. Still, one of the fastest-growing areas remains consumer electronics, with a host of new features, such as 3-D in VCRs. Despite increased sophistication, electronics remains about three years behind the newest Japan has to offer.    Car exports are also booming. This year South Korea expects to export 685,000 Hyundai and other cars, twice as many as in 1986. &quot;We still think the auto industry is in its infant stage,&quot; says Lee Hong-Kyu, deputy director of industrial policy. Piano exports, which topped 90,000 in 1986, slice into the Japanese market, although names such as Youngchang Akki, Samick and Daewoo still aren't well-known in the U.S.    The most profitable new growth area: military equipment, with exports aimed at Third World countries.    SOUTH KOREA'S ECONOMY pulls further ahead of its northern neighbor.    Exports push the country's 1986 annual per-capita gross national product to $2,270, while North Korea's GNP stagnates at less than $800 per person. Military spending accounts for 25% of North Korean production, compared to 6% in South Korea. &quot;The North Korean economy hasn't grown significantly since 1970,&quot; says Kim Yung-Kyoo of the National Unification Board.    The outlook for the Communist country is dismal. A 1984 law designed to attract foreign joint ventures spawned only minor retail projects. North Korea, which had only a few hundred visitors last year, pushes tourism, hoping to capitalize on the 1988 summer Olympics in Seoul. It draws up plans for mountain resorts and seeks direct air service from Tokyo but can't get badly needed Western loans.    THE STOCK MARKET, up 70% last year, continues to boom.    Electronics, securities and insurance companies were the main beneficiaries of a roaring bull market in 1986. But corporate earnings this year are expected to grow at about 20%, compared with 35% last year. Economists say that will be reflected in less spectacular stock-price increases. Electronics exporters and parts makers are expected to fuel much of the market's growth in 1987 because their products are now more competitive with the Japanese, due to a strong yen.    Still, the Korea Stock Exchange remains off-limits to most foreigners, with Korea-oriented mutual funds providing the main way to invest. The government promises to open up the tiny stock market near the end of the year, but most brokers expect laws will limit how much stock foreigners can own. &quot;Everyone will be buying a crumb and waiting for it to grow into a nice slice,&quot; says broker Scott Kalb of James Capel andamp; Co.    An expected upward revaluation of the won would make foreign dollars already invested worth more.    SEOUL'S RUSH TO BUILD creates snafus. A national museum burns only days before its dedication, due to faulty wiring. Tourist signs are posted too high to read. The new subway runs $2.38 billion in debt because ridership is 50% below estimates.    THE SPORTY LEMANS compact car sets sales records in South Korea. Builder Daewoo Corp. says demand presages success in the U.S., where Pontiac dealers will sell the cars starting in late 1987. Factory price is $4,240, but U.S. sticker price hasn't been set.    BORROWED MONIKER: When an accident killed two workers at a &quot;DuPont&quot; factory in South Korea, Wilmington, Del., chemicals giant Du Pont Co. bought South Korean newspaper ads explaining that the Korean company responsible had simply appropriated the name.    SMALL-BUSINESS SHORTAGE keeps South Korea leaning on Japan for parts.    For three decades, government policy has favored giant trading houses, or &quot;chaebol,&quot; leaving the country with few parts suppliers. Japanese parts make up 50% of South Korean cars and 60% of its video players. Last year's trade surplus, mostly from U.S. trade, hides a $5.4 billion trade deficit with Japan, up from $3 billion in 1985. &quot;That is our economy's biggest structural weakness,&quot; says Yang Joong Suk of the Small and Medium Industry Bank.    The sharp rise in the Japanese yen makes parts more expensive, prompting South Korea to push domestic production. It earmarks $8.66 billion over the next five years in loans and aid for small-business development and says that 14,435 imported items -- mostly machinery and electronic parts -- will be made locally. &quot;We must fight a war of independence from Japan,&quot; says Korean trade official Park Unsuh.    Big Korean companies find it hard to wean themselves from Japan. One reason: The Japanese are loath to give technology to potential competitors.    BRIEFS: Book vendors claim prices will surge 25% when South Korea's first copyright law goes into effect this year. . . . Movie censors ban &quot;Back to the Future&quot; for violating family values and &quot;Rambo&quot; for being too militaristic. </TEXT></DOC>
