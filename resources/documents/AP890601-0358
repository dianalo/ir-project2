U.S. District Judge Zita Weinshienk's ruling on Wednesdaycleared the way for the Golden brewer to list the alcohol contentof its products.   ``Coors felt this was a right consumers have and that they oughtto be able to be told what the alcohol content is in whateverbeverage they are drinking,'' said Coors spokesman Neil Peters.   Coors has been trying to emphasize through advertising that beeris the alcoholic beverage of moderation and that its beer does notcontain less alcohol than its competitors.   Coors, the nation's fourth-largest brewer, had filed a lawsuitagainst the Treasury Department over a law passed in the 1930sduring the post-Prohibition era.   When it approved the Federal Alcohol Administration Act,Congress was reacting to fears that brewers would try to boostsales by touting their beer as stronger. The ban does not apply todistilled liquor and wines, which routinely list their alcoholcontent.   Coors' lawsuit contended the ban violated Coors' right to freespeech under the First Amendment.   Coors' challenge was not opposed by the executive branch of thefederal government, but the U.S. House of Representatives joinedthe case as a defendant.   Congressional attorney Janina Jaruzelski had contended thatrepealing the ban would lead to ``misleading'' information, butWeinshienk rejected that argument.</TEXT></DOC>
