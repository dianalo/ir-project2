The proposed action is in accordance with the licensee's application foramendment dated September 22, 1988 and supplemented on January 17, andApril 12, 1989. The Need for the Proposed Action The proposed change to the Technical Specifications provides an independentsafety review function to be carried out by a full-time organization ratherthan a committee. This change increases the total resources committed tosafety reviews and provides more timely reviews. The independent safetyengineering function was eliminated because it was not required by theNRC at Big Rock Point. Environmental Impact of the Proposed Action The proposed organizational changes do not increase the risk of facilityaccidents. Thus, the proposed organizational changes do not involve anyincrease in the likelihood of the release of radioactive or non-radioactiveeffluents from those already determined, nor does the proposed action haveother environmental impacts. Therefore, the Commission concludes that thereare no measurable radiological or non-radiological environmental impactsassociated with the proposed organizational changes. The Notice of Consideration of Issuance of Amendment and Opportunity forHearing in connection with this action was published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on March 29, 1989 (54 FR 12977). No request forhearing or petition for leave to intervene was filed following this notice.Alternatives to the Proposed Action Since the Commission has concluded there are no measurable environmentalimpacts associated with the organizational change, any alternatives withequal or greater environmental impacts need not be evaluated. The principal alternative should be to deny the requested amendment. Theproposed organizational changes do not increase the risk of facility accidents.Thus, the proposed organizational changes do not involve any increase inthe release of radioactive or non-radioactive effluents from the plant.Alternative Use of Resources This action does not involve the use of resources beyond the scope of resourcesused during normal plant operation. Agencies and Persons Contacted The Commission's staff reviewed the licensee's request and did not consultother agencies or persons. Finding of No Significant Impact Based upon the foregoing assessment, the Commission concludes that theproposed action will not have a significant effect on the quality of thehuman environment. Accordingly, the Commission has determined not to preparean environmental impact statement for the proposed application for amendment.For further details with respect to this action, see the licensee's applicationdated September 22, 1988, as supplemented January 17, and April 12, 1989,which is available for public inspection at the Commission's Public DocumentRoom, Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC, and at NorthCentral Michigan College, 1515 Howard Street, Petoskey, Michigan 49770.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated at Rockville, Maryland this 10th day of August 1989. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">For the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Lawrence A.
