Such split rolling element cages in which a so-called lock mounted on the      cage ends fixes them at least in the axial direction are known for example      from EP-PS 0,016,880. In this variant, the projections and recesses in the      cage ends are designed so that these cage ends are fixed in the axial as      well as in the radial direction by interlocking but are movable relative      to each other in the peripheral direction. As far as their function is      concerned, these types of cage locks do indeed serve their purpose. </PAR><PAR>  A disadvantage, however, seems to be the large space requirement of these      cage locks. The design space of the cage lock detracts from the number of      rolling elements that can be accommodated in the cage so that the bearing      capacity of such split cage/rolling element assemblies is lower than that      of unsplit assemblies. </PAR><PAC>  OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  It is an object of the invention to provide a split cage for rolling      elements in which the design space requirement of the lock is reduced to a      minimum and in which an optimum number of rolling elements can be      accommodated in the cage. </PAR><PAR>  This and other objects and advantages of the invention will become obvious      from the following detailed description. </PAR><PAC>  THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  This object is achieved according to the invention in that the recesses in      the crossbar forming the respective cage end extend into the adjacent      pocket, and, when the separating gap is closed, the projections extend at      the most upto the delimiting surface of the pocket facing the cage end. By      the construction of the invention, it is achieved that the so-called cage      lock is completely integrated into the crossbar forming the respective      cage end so that the space requirement of the cage lock in the peripheral      direction is approximately only double that of an individual crossbar in      the rest of the cage. The number of rolling elements that can be      accommodated in the cage is therefore hardly prejudiced by the lock      construction of the invention. The width of the crossbar is utilized to      assure the guidance of the lock in the peripheral direction. </PAR><PAR>  A particularly advantgeous embodiment of the invention provides, especially      in the case of multi-row rolling element cages, that several projections      and recesses be arranged alternately in the axial direction on the cage      ends. For fixing the cage ends in the peripheral direction, it is possible      to additionally provide mutually corresponding lugs in the region of these      projections and recesses so that the cage ends can execute a limited      movement in the peripheral direction before the lugs hook into each other. </PAR><PAR>  In another embodiment, guiding surfaces corresponding to each other are      arranged in the peripheral direction in the region of the projections and      recesses and fix the cage ends in the radial direction. A further variant      of the invention, in which the cage ends are fixed in both axial and in      both radial directions by interlocking and can only execute a limited      movement in the peripheral direction, is obtained if mutually      corresponding lugs as well as guiding surfaces are provided. </PAR><PAR>  With a view to assembly by robots, it appears to be appropriate to fix the      cage ends of split cages relative to each other in all spatial directions      before assembly. This is accomplished by the invention by the fact that      brittle joints are provided between the cage ends in the region of the      projections and recesses while the separating gap is still open, which      brittle joints form a location of intended fracture and can easily be      broken open during the assembly of the cage by closing the separating gap.      It is particularly advantageous to arrange the joint location between the      contiguous edges of two projections. </PAR></BSUM><DRWD> <PAR>  Referring now to the drawings: </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 1 is a perspective view of a rolling element cage of the invention, </PAR><PAR>  FIGS. 2 to 4 are partial top views of a rolling element cage of the      invention, </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 5 is a partial perspective view of the rolling element cage of FIG. 4, </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 6 is a partial top view of a rolling element cage of the invention      comprising a joint location. </PAR></DRWD><DETD> <PAR>  FIG. 1 is a perspective representation of a rolling element cage 1 which      comprises pockets 2 for rolling elements and which is split at one point      of its periphery, the cage ends 4, 5 delimiting the separating gap 3 being      formed by crossbars 6, 7 on which projections 8 and corresponding recesses      9 are provided which cooperate with each other so that the cage ends 4, 5      are fixed relative to each other in the axial direction. The recess 9,      which is actually a break-through, extends from the cage end 4 to the      adjacent pocket 10 so that the crossbar 6 forming the cage end 4 is      completely integrated into the so-called cage lock 11. Thus, the distance      in the peripheral direction between the respective pockets 10, 12      adjoining the cage ends corresponds to approximately only double the width      of a crossbar between any two pockets 2 in the rest of the cage 1, whereby      it is achieved that an optimum number of rolling elements can be      accommodated in the cage 1. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 2 shows a partial top view of a rolling element cage 1 in the region      of the separating gap 3 and the cage lock 11. In this embodiment,      projections 8 and recesses 9 are arranged alternately in the axial      direction on the crossbars 6, 7. In FIG. 3 again, only the cage section      comprising the separating gap 3 is shown, the projections 8 with the      corresponding recesses 9 being arranged so that mutually corresponding      lugs 13, 14 can be provided in their region, which lugs permits a limited      movement of the cage ends 4, 5 in the peripheral direction before hooking      into each other. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 4 shows a development of FIG. 3 in which guiding surfaces 15, 16 are      provided on the projections 8 and the recesses 9 and fix the cage ends      relative to each other in the radial direction whereas at the same time      corresponding lugs 13, 14 provided on the sides of the projections 8      facing away from the guiding surfaces 15, 16 permit a limited movement of      the cage ends 4, 5 in the peripheral direction before hooking into each      other. To make this more clear, the embodiment of FIG. 4 is represented      once more in perspective in FIG. 5. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 6 shows a version of the cage which is suitable in particular for      assembly by robots. Before assembly and with the separating gap 3 open,      the projections 8 are joined to each other at their contiguous edges by a      brittle joint which forms a location of intended fracture. During      assembly, the separating gap 3 is closed by the gripper of the robot which      results in the brittle joint 17 breaking open and assures the movability      of the cage ends 4, 5 in the peripheral direction. Further constructional      variants other than these examples of embodiment are conceivable in which      the cage lock is integrated into the crossbars of the pockets adjoining      the cage ends. </PAR><PAR>  Various modifications of the cage of the invention may be made without      departing from the spirit or scope thereof and it should be understood      that the invention is intended to be limited only as defined in the      appended claims. </PAR></DETD><CLMS> <STM>  We claim: </STM><NUM>  1. </NUM><PAR>  1.
