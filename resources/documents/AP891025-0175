Senate GOP leader Bob Dole and Reps. Paul Henry, R-Mich., andMary Rose Oakar, D-Ohio, called on Americans to observe Anderson's42nd birthday Friday. They recommended wearing yellow ribbons,ringing church bells at noon, praying for the hostages' release andobserving a moment of silence at sporting events.   ``They will not and should not be forgotten,'' Dole, R-Kan.,said at a Capitol news conference. ``We're asking ... that we takeaction to symbolize our dedication toward winning their release.''   Henry sponsored a congressional resolution to designate Fridayas National Hostage Awareness Day, which President Bush signed intolaw Monday.   Anderson, the AP's chief Middle East correspondent, was siezedMarch 16, 1985, and is the longest held of eight Americans beingheld in Lebanon.   The lawmakers declined to discuss the U.S. government's handlingof the hostage situation or statements made this week by IranianPresident Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani and Islamic Jihad, apro-Iranian group holding at least two hostages.   Rafsanjani told reporters he was in no hurry to improverelations with the United States and gave no hint that hisgovernment was pushing to gain the hostages' release. Islamic Jihadreiterated its offer to swap Anderson and hostage Thomas Sutherlandfor 15 Shiite Moslems jailed in Kuwait.   ``We're trying to avoid injecting ourselves into some of thepolitical and policy'' matters, Henry said. ``The focus of this iswhat are we in America doing to keep this situation before us.''   Former hostages have said their spirits were bolstered by publicobservances on their behalf, which they managed to hear aboutdespite their isolation, Henry said.   Relatives of the hostages and former hostages will be among theparticipants in a Catholic ``Mass of Hope'' Friday at GeorgetownUniversity in Washington, said Carmella LaSpada, spokeswoman for NoGreater Love, a hostage support group.   Besides Anderson and Sutherland, the other U.S. hostages areFrank H. Reed, Joseph J. Cicippio, Edwin A. Tracy, Jessee J.Turner, Alann B. Steen and Robert B. Polhill.</TEXT></DOC>
