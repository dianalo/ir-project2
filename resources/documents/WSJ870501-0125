Brackeen president of the unit.    Mr. Brackeen had been vice president of space launch systems for the company's aerospace operation in Denver, where its Titan rockets are built. In his new post, 48-year-old Mr. Brackeen will be responsible for marketing, contracting and business development of the Titan for commercial use. Succeeding him as a vice president at the Denver operations will be Gareth D. Flora, 48, vice president of business development.    As previously reported, the aerospace and information systems concern predicts that by the early 1990s, annual commercial sales of its Titan rockets could be about $500 million. In addition, the company has preliminary agreements to launch satellites for a number of customers, and the International Telecommunications Satellite Organization has said it will buy two Titan rockets. </TEXT></DOC>
