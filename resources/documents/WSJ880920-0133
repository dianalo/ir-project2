Stern, chairman of Hartz Group, plans to donate more than $25 million to New York University to strengthen its schools of business, which would be named after Mr. Stern.    Mr. Stern's planned gift to the school would be the largest ever made to the university. NYU will use the money to consolidate the business schools in a single building on the Washington Square campus. The gift was first reported in Crain's New York Business.    Mr. Stern, 50 years old, received undergraduate and graduate degrees from NYU. Besides his large pet-products business, he is also a real estate developer and the owner of the Village Voice and 7 Days, both weeklies based here.    Details of the donation are still under discussion, according to a spokesman for Mr. Stern. He added that Mr. Stern and NYU have &quot;been in discussions for many months,&quot; and that &quot;an announcment will be made within a month.&quot;    A spokesman for NYU said the university expects &quot;to be able to say something officially on Oct. 6.&quot;    Under the presidency of John Brademas, NYU has received large financial gifts from a number of distinguished alumni, including CBS Inc.'s chairman, Laurence A. Tisch. </TEXT></DOC>
