STEICHEN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>GDANSK, Poland (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   About 400 workers carrying the Polish flagand chanting ``Solidarity'' marched through the Lenin shipyard toits main gate on Monday and proclaimed a strike, the yard's secondthis year.   The outlawed free trade federation Solidarity had urged theshipyard's 10,000 workers to join a string of occupation strikesdemanding union recognition and wage increases.   At least 10 coal mines in southern Poland and transit anddockworkers in the Baltic port of Szczecin remained on strike onthe seventh day of Poland's worst wave of labor unrest since 1981.At least 76,000 workers were idled.   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa offered Sunday to suspend his callfor a Gdansk shipyard strike if the government agreed to talks onthe labor strife.   But the offer went unheeded.   There was no sign of police interference as, 2{ hours after theday shift began, workers took over the main gate of the shipyardwhere Solidarity was born. In May, the yard was the scene of an8-day strike that ended inconclusively.   ``We warn the authorities that in case force is used against thestriking workforce, the full responsibility for the consequenceswill lie with Polish authorities,'' strike leaders in Szczecin saidin a statement late Sunday.   Police and riot troops were seen gathering around two Szczecinshipyards which have not gone on strike, strike leaders said. Theyalso patrolled the streets of Gdansk.   Striking dockworkers in Szczecin, fearing a police raid, saidthey had rolled cranes and other equipment to block the entrancesto the port, which they have been occupying since Wednesday.   Interfactory strike committee member Jozef Kowalczyk said at 6a.m. that the night had passed without incident.   In Jastrzebie, the center of the coal-mine strikes in thesouthwestern Silesia region, miners on Monday published the firstedition of a strike newspaper and management and workers exchangedletters setting forth their positions on undertaking talks.   Walesa, speaking at St. Brygida's church Sunday to about 3,000union supporters, said authorities had approached him throughunofficial channels about holding talks, but gave few details.   He said he expected the government's reply to be delivered onthe national television news Sunday evening. But the news, devotedmainly to the existing strikes across Poland, carried no mention ofWalesa and no hint about talks.   Instead, the commentator suggested the strikes would continue.   ``Tomorrow Poland will enter the second week of strikes, and wewill continue estimating the losses for our economy,'' said TV newsannouncer Waldemar Milewicz.   A spokesman in the government press office in Warsaw also had nocomment on Walesa's remarks.   After watching the newscast at St. Brygida's, Walesa brushedpast reporters and went home, saying only that his earlierstatements stood.   Meanwhile, the Solidarity committee of the Nowa Huta steel milloutside Krakow issued a statement Sunday calling on steelworkers to``support strikers' demands at the proper moment.''   Solidarity, the first independent union in the Soviet bloc, wasfounded in the Gdansk shipyard in 1980. It was suppressed in aDecember 1981 military crackdown after massive strikes and outlawedthe next fall.   The government-controlled media has called the current strikesillegal and and stressed their rising cost to the economy. But ithas made no clear statement on the government's plans.   Polish leader Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski met Saturday with topmilitary leaders. The state-run PAP news agency said they made``appropriate decisions ... in connection with the presentthreats,'' but it was not known what they decided.   Walesa, the 1983 Nobel Peace Prize laureate, told the crowd atSt. Brygida's that he wanted to avoid a strike.   ``We cannot pull Poland out of her troubles by means ofstrikes,'' he said. ``We are ready for dialogue and talks.''   Police barred priests from entering the July Manifesto mine inSilesia Sunday morning to say Mass, angering striking miners whohad to listen over loudspeakers, but dockworkers were permittedreligious services at the idled port in Szczecin.   At Szczecin, the country's second-busiest port after Gdansk,about 500 dockworkers attended a Mass, according to a strikecommittee spokesman reached by telephone. About 200 sympathizersand family members listened to the Mass from beyond the port gates.   But at the coal mine in Jastrzebie, where the labor unrest beganTuesday, angry erupted when authorities barred two priests fromentering.   Strike leaders pleaded for 90 minutes for the clergymen to belet in as hundreds of strikers chanted, ``We want the priests. Wewant the priests.''   But when authorities would not relent, a makeshift altar madeand the Mass was broadcast over loudspeakers to those inside.   PAP claimed Sunday that ``the wildcat strikes are controlled bya narrow group of people who do not hide their political aims.   It said several thousand miners had signed declarations thatthey want to return to work.</TEXT></DOC>
