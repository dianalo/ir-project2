The fight over Unix, a base layer of computer software, isreminiscent of the days when railroads laid tracks of differentgauges and couldn't agree who should rip theirs up.   Railroad museums have pictures showing that stevedores once hadto lug freight between trains that couldn't run on the same tracks.   Most railroads overcame their differences decades ago, butcomputer makers are still at each other's throats.   There are few pure hearts in the fight over computer standards,which pits American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co. and the upstart SunMicrosystems Inc. against International Business Machines Corp.,Digital Equipment Corp., Hewlett-Packard Co. and four others.   Customers are clamoring for Unix, the prize in this battle,because it allows them to run the same programs on different kindsof computers.   As things are now, it's as if someone had to buy one kind oftelevision to watch ``Dallas'' and another kind to watch ``MondayNight Football.''   ATandamp;T made the telephone easy to use and says it can do the samefor computers. ATandamp;T invented Unix and wants to continue controllingits development, with Sun's help.   But by the end of the week, some people were saying that ATandamp;Thad miscalculated, alienating not only its rivals but somecustomers as well.   William H. Anderson, the computer chief for Prudential-BacheSecurities Inc., said ATandamp;T had performed a ``disservice'' tocustomers by altering Unix to make it more dependent on a computerchip designed by its partner, Sun Microsystems.   ATandamp;T denies it has doctored Unix for its own purposes. Thecompany says Unix is in good hands and questions the motives ofsome of its rivals, which want to turn over development of Unix toan Open Software Foundation.   The foundation, announced Tuesday, is backed by $90 million overits first three years. Its mission is to create a computing``environment'' that would include a unified version of Unix.   ATandamp;T is refusing to join the foundation, and there is apossibility that Unix will split in half just as it reaches the bigleagues.   ``I think that ATandamp;T has not learned that it is no longerpossible for a single company to control standards,'' said MarvinSirbu, a computer standards expert at Carnegie-Mellon Universitywho takes the side of the Open Software Foundation.   The stakes are high. Computer systems that primarily use Unixare likely to make up 22 percent of a $120 billion world market by1991, up from 6 percent of an $87 billion world market in 1986,International Data Corp. estimates.   Some ATandamp;T executives are hinting that IBM and Digital mightimpede progress toward a unified Unix for selfish reasons.   It is indisputable that computer makers such as IBM and Digitalbenefit when they can lock customers into their own, privateoperating systems. That way they can charge more for productsbecause there is less competition. Customers can't afford to switchto another supplier because they would have to junk all theirexisting equipment.   But like it or not, IBM and Digital are being pushed to supportopen operating systems such as Unix because customers are demandingthem.   Prudential-Bache is insisting on Unix for many uses because itallows the company to choose computers with the best combination ofprice and performance without worrying that they won't be able torun the company's software, Anderson said.   Anderson dismisses the theory that IBM and Digital would try tofragment Unix to keep customers using their own, private operatingsystems. ``I've listened to talk like that for the last 30 years,''he said.   Other observers are more willing to attribute ulterior motivesto IBM and Digital. But they say any impulses by those companies toundermine Unix would be checked by Hewlett-Packard, Apollo ComputerInc. and other members of the new foundation.   By Thursday, realizing it was losing ground in thepublic-relations battle, ATandamp;T said it was willing to cooperate withthe foundation and might some day put Unix development into aseparate ATandamp;T group at arm's length from the Data Systems Division.   Forty years after the first computers, visionaries are stillwaiting for the day when word processing will be as easy as foodprocessing and searching a data base will be as simple as thumbingthrough an encyclopedia.   Standardizing on Unix is a step in that direction, as aresetting standards for the ways computers hook up in networks andachieving some uniformity in the ``look and feel'' of computersoftware.   Unfortunately, each move toward standards seems to involve afight. Apple Computer Inc., for example, is suing Hewlett-Packardfor copyright infringement over the similar appearance of theirsoftware.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
