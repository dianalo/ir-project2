The Environmental Protection Agency's long-delayed rules,the federal government's first comprehensive standards formunicipal trash facilities, are estimated to cost about $330million a year, or about $4 a household. The rules have beendelayed for more than three years, partly in response toWhite House objections to their cost.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;Despite recent advances in recycling and incineration,landfills will continue to be the only means of disposal formany communities for years to come,&quot; said EPA administratorWilliam Reilly. &quot;EPA intends to assure the integrity of theselandfills.&quot;   The rules set standards for the location, design,operation and closure of landfills. They generally must bemet within two years. Groundwater-monitoring requirementswill be phased in over five years.   Most of the 6,000 solid-waste landfills operating todayaren't environmentally acceptable, according to the EPA,which predicts that 50% of those will close within fiveyears, partly as a result of the new rules.   Under the program, states will have to incorporate thefederal standards into their permit programs for trashfacilities and get those programs approved by the EPA. TheEPA will impose the federal standards on states that don'tsubmit acceptable plans. If a state's plan is approved,however, the state can tailor various requirements to localconditions.   Critics contended that this flexibility will allow somestates to adopt weak programs. &quot;The good news is this rule isout and it offers some new protection,&quot; said Daniel Weiss,who works on waste issues for the Sierra Club. &quot;The bad newsis there are loopholes, so some people will remain at risk.&quot;   Major trash companies, which have been upgrading theirdumps in anticipation of stiffer rules, contend thatlower-quality dumps owned by municipalities could stay openfor some time.   That will delay the lucrative shift of some trash to theprivate companies' dumps. Still, the industry hopes the ruleswill accelerate closings, boosting profits of big dumps ownedby Waste Management Inc., Browning-Ferris Industries Inc.,Chambers Development Co. and other companies.   Environmentalists also criticized as too weak the rule'sprovisions on leak detection, groundwater monitoring andenforcement.   Among other provisions, the rule requires landfilloperators to:   -- Keep out certain hazardous waste, cover the trashdaily, monitor methane gas and restrict public access.   -- Design new facilities to protect drinking water.   -- Maintain monitoring wells to detect groundwatercontamination and clean up any contamination that is found.   -- Monitor closed landfills for 30 years.</TEXT></DOC>
