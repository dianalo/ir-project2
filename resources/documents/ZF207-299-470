(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Waving a magic wandandM;Presentation managers suffer culture shock when they move from presentationvia slides to computers, even though much more sophisticated effects --wipes, fades, even animation -- are available from the PC.andM;A slide presentation can be controlled from a remote-control, sometimes eveninfra-red, TV-wise, whereas the operator of a computer show has to be buriedbehind a desktop.andP;  This means that a computer show usually needs two people:a PC operator and a presenter, with the latter having to call out 'next,please', which is more reminiscent of a vicarage missionary show than a hightech presentation.andM;Posed like that, of course, the solution becomes immediately obvious: givethe presenter something like a TV remote control to manipulate the computerimage the way you want.andP;  And applying that process of lateral thinking, wenow have a choice of not one, but two devices that do just that.andM;Both operate in basically the same way.andP;  An infra-red sensor is connected tothe RS232C port of the PC and memory-resident software is run to translatekey presses on the remote control device into the codes necessary to simulateEnter, Esc, Cursor-down, and so on.andM;The differences are in the sensitivity of the device, the flexibility of theway in which new command sets may be added to the repertoire of the PC Remotecontrol, and -- most importantly -- if it is possible to switch from onecommand set to another.andM;The Wand is marketed by the British company responsible for Davrelle, thesuperlative graphics presentation software.andP;  Although Davrelle is a GEMapplication, the Wand can be used within any application.andM;PC Remote also has a sound pedigree in PC presentations.andP;  Reflex, the Britishdistributor, also markets VideoShow, one of the most successfulhardware-and-software combinations for presentation graphics.andP;  But whileVideoShow is more expensive than many PCs, PC Remote is very much a budgetproduct, costing just over half the price of the Wand.andP;  PC Remote carries anEastman Kodak copyright line, so its pedigree is equally immaculate.andM;PC Remote differs from the Wand in that it also caters for the few RS232ports which don't deliver the necessary voltage to power the infra-redsensor, having a socket for a power supply which may be connected to asupplied calculator-style step-down transformer.andP;  However, this wasn't neededon any of my PCs.andM;A number of samples are provided for both devices, two only for PC Remote --Lotus 1-2-3 and PC Storyboard -- but many more with the Wand, for programslike Davrelle, Lotus, Ventura, Harvard, VCN Concorde, and so on.andM;The PC Remote configuration files are simple text files which may be editedusing any editor, so I manipulated the supplied Lotus command set in orderthat I could change my data directory by simply pressing the '0' key.andP;  (Yes,I know this can be done with a Lotus macro, but I was just testing.)andM;The edited file reads as follows: andless;ir upandgt;andless;Upandgt;andless;ir downandgt;andless;Downandgt;andless;ir leftandgt;andless;leftandgt;andless;ir rightandgt;andless;Rightandgt;andless;ir menuandgt;/andless;ir selectandgt;

 Any of the keys,including the cursors, may be mapped to any function.andM;It is possible to load a new definition merely by typing IRREMOTE filename.andO;It may be connected to the COM1 or COM2 port merely by adding a /1 or /2switch, and unloaded from memory with a /D switch.andM;The Wand has two more keys, no cursors as such, but the supplied templatestend to map the numeric keys to the cursors.andM;In addition, there are four letter keys: A, B, C and D; four keys labelled P,M, T and H above; and PREV, LAST MENU, TOP MENU and HELP under the keys, plusa red button labelled STOP and a green one labelled NEXT.andM;Again, any of these may be mapped to any function.andP;  Cut-out templates areprovided to be put onto the Wand with your own custom labels for the buttons.andM;The Wand has a program, SETWAND.EXE, which must be run to configure a newcommand set, or edit an existing one.andP;  The resulting files with a .WTPextension are not editable or viewable outside this program.andM;During the installation process, one of these may be chosen as a default:otherwise the Wand is activated by the command WAND filename, in a similarmanner to PC Remote.andP;  Most seriously, however, it is not possible to movefrom one command set to another without rebooting, and there is no command toremove the software from memory.andP;  However, in practice, I found it easy tomodify a supplied command set so it included all the commands I mightpossibly need in a variety of programs.andM;I found both these devices very useful, and positioned one at a remote deskso I could look through files from the other side of the room in a widevariety of applications, including Framework, Lotus, Ventura, and Davrelle.andO;Strangely, the cursor keys didn't work within Portex on either device, butstill functioned when I quit the program, so there is obviously somethingstrange about the way this program functions.andM;I would be happy to have either as an accessory to my work, but at nearlytwice the price I would find it hard to justify the extra cost of the Wandover the almost equally functional PC Remote.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
