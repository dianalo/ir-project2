It was the first time the association, whose members manage 97% of the funds in Britain's unit trusts, had reported a net redemption since May 1980, when redemptions exceeded sales by just #50,000.    Sales fell to #814 million in November, the lowest total of the year, from #1.14 billion in October. Meanwhile, redemptions eased to #826.7 million from #895.7 million.    In November 1986, sales were #828 million and redemptions were #286.2 million, for net new investment of #541.8 million.    Total funds under management fell #2.8 billion in November to #34.6 billion, reflecting continued declines in stock prices, the association said. Funds under management fell #12.8 billion in October to #37.4 billion, matching the steep decline in share values late in the month. </TEXT></DOC>
