The researchers at the University of California, LosAngeles, and University of Texas, San Antonio, caution thatother genes probably predispose people to alcoholism and thattheir findings must be repeated in a larger study beforebeing put to practical use to combat alcoholism.</LP><TEXT>   But the findings could lead within five years to theavailability of a blood test to detect the presence of genesassociated with the condition. Such tests, the scientistssay, could help divert children predisposed to alcoholismfrom situations that increase the chances of becoming analcoholic.   Within the decade, the research could aid theadministration of drugs, some already available, that wouldtreat genetically based alcoholism by blocking the gene.Similar drug therapies have resulted in improvements amongthose suffering from schizophrenia. And in 30 to 40 years,this type of research may help scientists who are nowconducting tests with animals to genetically rework humans,replacing such degenerative or &quot;bad&quot; genes with healthy, or&quot;good&quot; ones.   &quot;Ultimately, the implications of using this information intreatment are amazing,&quot; says Enoch Gordis, director of theNational Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism. Studiesshow that alcoholism accounts for about 105,000 deaths eachyear, and this year will cost the nation an estimated $136.5billion in lost employment, reduced productivity andhealth-care costs.   &quot;The chances are very good that other genes andenvironmental factors are involved in alcoholism,&quot; saysErnest P. Noble, co-author of the study and director ofUCLA's Alcohol Research Center. &quot;But this gene is obviouslyvery important.&quot;   In the study, published today in the Journal of theAmerican Medical Association, researchers report finding alink between the presence of the receptor gene for dopamine(a neurotransmitter in the brain associated withpleasure-seeking behaviors) and alcoholism. In theconstellation of some 100,000 genes in the human body, theresearchers say that of individuals with this gene, 77% werealcoholics. Only 28% of those without the gene werealcoholics. The researchers estimate that a quarter ofAmericans have the particular receptor gene they linked toalcoholism.   Dr. Noble says the research more firmly establishesalcoholism as a disease, and adds to evidence that geneticfactors are as important as environmental factors inpredisposing people to the disease.   Dr. Gordis says the federal government's own $25 millionfive-year continuing effort to find genes linked toalcoholism may well buttress the study's findings. TheUCLA-Texas study will also add to the broader geneticknowledge that is accumulating in the rush to identify genesthat predispose one to cancer, depression, even criminalactivity.   &quot;We are finding the genetic determinants for manydiseases. With this knowledge, we can prevent the propagationof disease,&quot; says Daniel Flavin, the medical and scientificdirector for the National Council on Alcoholism and DrugDependence, a nonprofit educational and advocacy group.   Alcoholism's hereditary ties have long been suspected,because alcoholism often runs in families. For much of thiscentury, however, environmental factors have been consideredat least as important in determining the disease, says DonaldW. Goodwin, chair of psychiatry at the University of KansasSchool of Medicine. &quot;Hitler made heredity a tainted word,&quot; hesays, citing public revulsion over the genetic research doneon humans in Germany.   Such environmental factors as the stress of financial orother personal problems are thought to play a significantrole in the disease, and researchers note that those withoutany genetic disposition can become alcoholics. Theenvironmental argument is bolstered by the few alcohol-abuseproblems experienced among groups, including the Amish andMormons, whose upbringing discourages alcohol use. Othersnote that alcoholism is five to six times more common in menthan women, which suggests environment-related factors in asociety that has been more tolerant of men drinking.   In the past 20 years, however, the evidence of heavygenetic influence in alcoholism has mounted. A Swedish studyof 1,775 adoptees found that children born of alcoholics, butadopted by nonalcoholics, nonetheless were six times morelikely than the general population to develop the disease.Similar Danish and U.S. studies using twins and adoptees havefound that children of alcoholics have four times the risk ofdeveloping the disease compared with children ofnonalcoholics.   Researchers have also shown that members ofalcoholism-prone families exhibit different brain waves. Theyhave even categorized types of alcoholics -- some in whichgenetics, rather than environment, plays a preponderant roleand results in the early onset of the disease and moreanti-social behavior.   But researchers have had a tougher time demonstratingspecific molecular genetic causes for alcoholism.   The UCLA-Texas researchers say they focused on one genebecause it has been suspected of playing a role inschizophrenia, Parkinson's disease, drug abuse and cocaineaddiction. Studies culminating in 1988 showed that more ratswith the receptor gene tended to drink heavily. The new studylooked at eight other genes thought to be associated withalcoholism, but found no significant correlation. The 77%correlation with the one gene was striking becausealcoholism, like cancer, comes in multiple forms.   Some genetic experts, nonetheless, greet the findings withskepticism, cautioning that it's difficult to replicatestudies associating genes with disorders, such as manicdepression and schizophrenia. The UCLA-Texas study, theynote, used only 70 human cadavers.   David Comings, director of the Department of MedicalGenetics at City of Hope Medical Center in Duarte, Calif.,says that after a specific type of genetic mutation linked tocystic fibrosis was found in 70% of subjects, the AmericanSociety of Human Genetics deemed that percentage too low toestablish the mutation as a predictor of that disease. &quot;Afterall, a 50-50 chance is random,&quot; he says. &quot;There might beanother gene that is much more important than this one.&quot; Henotes that researchers trying to block this particularreceptor gene with drugs have seen little effect in treatingalcoholics.   And scientists say that unlike genetic diseases such asHuntington's chorea or cystic fibrosis, for which one gene isthought to be the cause, alcoholism is considered to be tiedto several genes. That means no one genetic marker can tagall individuals at risk and other genes must still beidentified and studied.   Still, says Dr. Goodwin of the University of Kansas, &quot;Ifthis is confirmed, then you have something very important. .. . You could have a high degree of predictability of whowill become an alcoholic.&quot;   More immediately, the estimated $4 billion-a-year alcoholtreatment industry hopes the study will help convince morealcoholics that theirs is a disease requiring medical care.&quot;Most families still don't really believe this is a disease.They feel ashamed and embarrassed by it,&quot; says Frank Picard,who counsels Portland, Ore., alcoholics on getting treatment.&quot;This will help them see alcoholism as a health problem. Itwill help them get help.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
