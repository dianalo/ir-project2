SettlesEnvironmentalist's Lawsuit</HL><DD> 02/03/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> DOW </IN><DATELINE> MIDLAND, Mich.  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Dow Chemical Co. said it settled a lawsuit filed against the company and local government officials by an environmental activist who claimed the company defamed her and violated her civil rights.    An attorney for Melissa Ortquist, of Beacon, N.Y., said Dow paid an unspecified amount to Ms. Ortquist to settle the lawsuit, which stemmed from a 1985 wrangle between environmentalists and Dow.    &quot;We feel, and hope, the settlement was substantial enough to deter Dow and Midland (Mich.) County from this in the future,&quot; said Barbara Klimaszewski, the attorney. She said the lawsuit has been dropped.    Ms. Ortquist was arrested in summer 1985 on a trespass charge by Dow after activists from the ship Greenpeace plugged effluent pipes at one of Dow's riverside plants here. Subsequently, she was acquitted of the charge.    While in jail, however, Ms. Ortquist submitted voluntarily to a routine blood test, the results of which ended up in the hands of Dow security officials. A Dow spokesman then called a local activist allied with Greenpeace to relay the message that the blood test showed possible presence of a venereal disease, the activist said. Later, Ms. Ortquist was found free of disease. </TEXT></DOC>
