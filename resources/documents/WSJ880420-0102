Karr (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> AR </CO><IN> MIN </IN><G> LBR </G><TEXT>   Federal inspectors cited Asarco Inc.'s East Helena, Mont., lead smelter, saying the company willfully violated federal lead and arsenic health standards.    The inspectors proposed fines totaling $1.6 million, one of the largest such penalties sought against any company by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, which has stepped up its enforcement efforts in the past two years.    OSHA said its inspection, begun last October, found 202 &quot;egregious willful&quot; violations, including exposing workers to lead and arsenic at levels &quot;far in excess&quot; of permitted levels, and failing to use engineering controls to reduce that exposure.    The citations suggest a worsening condition at the smelter, which Asarco said hadn't been fined since 1980, when OSHA proposed fines of $39,600. But the New York mining concern plans to contest many of the citations. It cited declining levels of lead in the blood of the smelter's 300 employees as evidence that it has made significant improvements in reducing worker exposure to lead. All employees currently test below OSHA's blood-lead standard, Asarco said.    &quot;This plant has consistently ignored basic safety and health protection for its workers,&quot; said Frank White, deputy assistant secretary of labor for OSHA. The company has 15 working days to contest the citations and proposed fines before the independent Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission.    Asarco also failed to adequately monitor lead and arsenic in the air, to provide properly fit-tested respirators for workers and to do proper housekeeping, such as keeping work surfaces free from lead and arsenic accumulations, the federal agency said.    OSHA also cited the smelter for other allegedly willful violations, including insufficient respiratory protection for workers exposed to carbon monoxide in blast furnaces, and improper storage and handling of hydrogen peroxide. OSHA defines a willful violation as one in which an employer knew a violation was being committed or was aware of a hazardous condition and didn't try reasonably to correct it. </TEXT></DOC>
