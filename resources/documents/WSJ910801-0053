Or so it seems for followersof the Institute for Research in Human Happiness, Japan'sfastest growing sect.</LP><TEXT>   While some U.S. religious groups mesmerize throngs throughrock music, television shows and theme parks,success-oriented Japanese take pleasure in answeringquestions like, Which of the following are not among thingsthe evil spirits dislike: (a) psychic power; (b) contentment;(c) modesty; (d) self-reflection, or (e) desire forself-improvement. {Answer: (a)}   Mari Kume derived so much joy in accumulating knowledgethrough test-taking that the 26-year-old abandoned plans tobecome a biologist at a research lab and joined the instituteas a staff member. &quot;My interest in analyzing the structure ofprotein started to fade,&quot; she says.   The five-year-old institute is the creation of RyuhoOkawa, who, as it turns out, was no standout at taking tests.He flunked his entrance exam to Tokyo University, then faileda bar exam and a civil service test. (He did studyinternational finance at New York University and law at TokyoUniversity, and until five years ago was a finance officer ata major trading firm, where he distinguished himself as thefirst employee to bring a portable shrine into the companydormitory.)   In spite of his unimpressive testing career, Mr. Okawalists lofty credentials. He claims to be Buddha reincarnated,and, before Buddha, to have been the Greek god Hermes. Hesays he has talked with Picasso, Jesus Christ and Newton, allof whom helped him devise a four-pronged approach tohappiness: love, intellect, self-reflection and development.   The testing and book reports were his own ideas, and arather natural epiphany for a finance-officer-turned-writer.Institute candidates must prepare book reports on 10 of hisbooks. Once accepted, his estimated 1.5 million followers, ofwhom 15% are devoted test-takers, continue to study Mr.Okawa's writings to pass exams and advance through sevenspiritual levels.   Roughly one million people subscribe to the institute'smonthly magazine, containing such pieces as highlights of hisspeech on &quot;The Conditions of an Angel.&quot; Heaven only knows howmany more are inspired by Monthly Miracle, a free magazinethat recently featured a cartoon with a robot called Miraclewho visits a bookstore and marvels at the number of books Mr.Okawa has written.   More than 27 million copies of Mr. Okawa's books are incirculation, his staff estimates. He has become one of therichest authors in Japan. Last year, sales of his 130 booksand of his cassette tapes totaled 312 million yen ($2.2million) for his publishing unit alone, and that doesn'tinclude proceeds from six other companies that sell hisbooks.   Staffers say the test-taking isn't designed to sell books;Mr. Okawa, they say, is interested in weeding out casualhappiness seekers. Hiroshi Matsumoto, for one, assumed hecould just breeze into the institute. But he flunked hisfirst test, and his one-page book report was rejected with anice note suggesting he study more and try again in threemonths.   &quot;It was a sudden awakening,&quot; says the 31-year-old, who hassince buckled down and advanced to the fourth level, whichenables him to teach others.   Such zest for study may seem surprising, considering thatmost Japanese spend much of their youth struggling through&quot;examination hell&quot; to ensure they get into good high schoolsand universities. Some have suggested that filling outbluebooks on Buddha provides a kind of comfort to examophileswho have perfected their testtaking and memorizing skills.   For those who need extra coaching, pep-rally-type studysessions are held in hotels in the countryside. And forprocrastinators, there's a cheat-sheet called the &quot;Mind UpSeries,&quot; which efficiently catalogs Mr. Okawa's major themes.A favorite saying involves snowballs. People, Mr. Okawa says,should view life as a snowball that picks up pebbles anddirt, but ultimately ends up fluffy, pure and white.   Strenuous standards might encourage cheating, but theinstitute doesn't seem too worried. One can look up answerson takehome multiple-choice tests, but it's harder to lie onessay questions like &quot;Why does love lead to happiness?&quot;   Mr. Okawa would not be interviewed for this article.Otherwise, he is not shy. Unlike most traditional Japanesereligious groups, which shun publicity, Mr. Okawa flies asilver blimp over Tokyo that flashes a message in red: &quot;Theage is now: Institute for Research in Human Happiness.&quot;   Full-page color ads with his photograph are found innational newspapers, and television commercials announce thatMr. Okawa has published more than three million copies of hisbest-selling book &quot;The Terrifying Revelations ofNostradamus,&quot; about the 16th-century French astrologer andphysician. And while members of other Japanese sects oftendon't like to acknowledge their involvement in the groups,his staffers sport stickers of the institute mascot,Leviathan, a smiling blue sea monster with yellow gills,accompanied by a slogan: &quot;Love] Love] Leviathan]&quot;   The group is &quot;completely changing the image of religion&quot;in Japan, says Hiromi Shimada, assistant professor ofreligious studies at Japan Women's University. Suchburgeoning mass support worries some religious scholars, andJapan's association of Buddhist sects doesn't acknowledge theinstitute, saying it is &quot;different in nature&quot; fromtraditional groups. Other observers say many of Mr. Okawa'spreachings seem harmless and make sense. (No doubt some makemore sense then others. Allah, Mr. Okawa says, told him thatthe internal political struggle in the Soviet Union ishappening partly because Mikhail Gorbachev is Julius Caesarreincarnated, while Boris Yeltsin used to be Brutus.)   Maybe the other sects are jealous. The happinessinstitute, which already outnumbers Japan's one millionChristians, vows to amass 10 million followers in a year, andto convert the whole nation by the turn of the century.   Recently, 50,000 ardent followers crowded the Tokyo Domefor Mr. Okawa's 35th birthday party. A suit-clad, somewhatsleepy-eyed Mr. Okawa appeared on stage, with his armsoutstretched telling the crowd he is Buddha. &quot;To die withoutfulfilling your mission means to break the pledge you madewith Buddha,&quot; he said, raising his high-pitched voice.Followers gazed fondly at his chubby figure atop the radiantstage, or at an image of him on two adjoining giant screens.   Not everyone is so impressed. A senior executive of aTokyo advertising company can't understand a book aboutvarious spirits living in a nine-dimensional world. &quot;Icouldn't follow it all,&quot; says the executive, who read threeof Mr. Okawa's books after repeated prodding by his boss,whose wife is a devoted member.   Regardless of what such skeptics think about theinstitute, Mr. Okawa's writings provide some hard-to-getinformation. Japanese novelist Tamio Kageyama needed someadvice when writing &quot;Borneo Hotel,&quot; a book about an Americanstudent with psychic powers who was trying to identifyspirits surrounding a hotel on a lonely island. Mr. Kageyamacredits Mr. Okawa's handy guide &quot;How to expel Evil Spirits.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
