However, a few flunked, somemiserably.;    Aside from the tiny Agnews Development Center water company,which cut use by 80 percent, Morgan Hill was the best, saving nearly 30percent. Stanford University, which used 8.5 percent more water than it did in1987, was the worst.;    Countywide, water use was down 19 percent last year,according to the report going to the water district board today. The savingsfor the year added up to 62,000 acre-feet, or 201 billion gallons.;   Representatives of the individual water companies could not be reached forcomment because of the Martin Luther King holiday.;    But water districtspokeswoman Teddy Morse said rationing helped make it possible for thedistrict to replenish its underground water reserves, which had dropped toalarming levels two years ago. If people hadn't conserved, that water wouldhave come out of the ground, and the reserves would be much smaller today.;   &quot;Now that it looks like a fifth year (of drought),&quot; she said, &quot;that reserve isreally going to be important.&quot;;    Mandatory water rationing has been in forcethroughout Santa Clara County since April 1 as the region suffered through afourth consecutive year of drought that has now continued into a fifth drywinter.;    Since then, the conservation goals have been a 20 percentreduction from 1987 consumption in most of Santa Clara County, and a 25percent cutback in Coyote Valley and south.;    Because there was no mandatoryrationing during the first three months of 1990, however, the year's actualconservation goal was 18.3 percent averaged over 12 months. South of Coyote,it was 22.7 percent.;    The 16 municipal agencies and private companies thatprovide approximately 85 percent of the water used in Santa Clara County sold273,117 acre-feet of water last year. Ground water pumped for agricultureaccounts for the remainder of use. An acre-foot is 325,800 gallons, enoughwater to cover a football field 11 inches deep.;    Ten of the 16 retailersmet their rationing goals.;    Santa Clara, with 25.3 percent savings for theyear, was the best in the North County. Cupertino at 24.8 percent, Sunnyvaleat 24.5 percent and Palo Alto at 23 percent were close behind.;    The 202,000customers of the San Jose Water Co., the biggest water retailer in the county,achieved an 18.4 percent savings for the year, slightly more than the 18.3percent goal. The company serves most of San Jose as well as Campbell,Cupertino, Los Gatos, Monte Sereno and Saratoga.;    On the other hand,Milpitas fell far short, conserving only 9.7 percent during the year.;    Inthe South County, Morgan Hill cut water use 29.98 percent, while neighboringGilroy squeezed out only a 5.1 percent reduction.;    Conservation would havebeen even greater but for this winter's weather. Water use normally tapers offin November and December when cooler weather and rain cut back the need foroutdoor watering, but this winter has been extremely dry.;    As a result,residents, businesses and industries used 4 percent more in November thanduring the same month in 1987, and saved only 3.6 percent in December.;   Through the combination of rationing and importing from the Sacramento-SanJoaquin Delta, the district was able to provide water throughout the countywhile cutting back 38 percent the water pumped from its underground reserve.;OUR 1990 WATER SAVINGS; Here is how much water the customers of each waterretailer in Santa Clara County saved in 1990. Since April 1, water rationinghas been set at a 20 percent reduction from 1987 consumption in most of thecounty, and a 25 percent cutback in Gilroy and Morgan Hill. However, there wasno rationing in the first three months of 1990, so the actual conservationgoals for the entire year were 18.3 percent in the north and 22.7 percent inSouth County.; ...; Water company                Gallons      Savings;                            consumed    from 1987; Agnews Center           21.4million        80.7%; California Water        3.82 billion        21.4%;Cupertino              841.3 million        24.8%; Gilroy                  1.9 billion         5.1%; Great Oaks              3.38 billion        19.1%;Milpitas                 3.0 billion        9.73%; Moffett Field           439 million       24.13%; Morgan Hill             1.44 billion       29.98%;Mountain View           4.39 billion       15.18%; Palo Alto              4.43 billion        23.0%; Purissima Hills        606.9 million         0.5%;San Jose City           4.03 billion        11.5%; San Jose Water Co.    41.15 billion        18.4%; Santa Clara             7.99 billion        25.3%;Stanford University     1.46 billion        -8.5%; Sunnyvale              7.61 billion        24.5%; ...; Source:  Santa Clara Valley Water District  </TEXT><BYLINE>  FRANK SWEENEY, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910122  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Tuesday  </DAY><MONTH>  January  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  CHART  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  812  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Tuesday January 22, 199100022105,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
