Four years ago, it would have been unthinkable for one of the three major networks to forgo such a trip. But the CBS decision that the trip's expense outweighed its news value was a harbinger of television coverage this election season. In the wake of the changes in the ownership of all three networks, and layoffs and other cost-cutting measures, the networks are determined to pay as much attention to their bottom line as they do to the presidential candidates.    In a critical change, the networks no longer plan to send correspondents, producers and camera crews to travel with every candidate, as they have in past campaigns. &quot;This time, we're questioning ourselves more with each assignment that is made: Is it worth the expense?&quot; says Joseph Angotti, executive producer of NBC News's election coverage.    Political candidates, of course, are disgruntled by the prospect of reduced national exposure. More importantly, some observers argue that the cutbacks will be especially damaging to lesser-known candidates, who need the exposure and credibility that television provides.    &quot;Without the luxury of network crews assigned to them full-time, the relative unknowns will have a more difficult time getting TV coverage -- even though some of them, such as Babbitt and du Pont, certainly have the most provocative and new ideas,&quot; says Gary Orren, Harvard University professor of public policy.    Yet some media critics welcome the change as an opportunity for television to improve its coverage of the election.    The networks &quot;have the chance to make lemonade out of lemons,&quot; says Stephen Hess, a senior fellow with the Brookings Institution, a Washington think tank. &quot;They may be cutting back for all the wrong reasons, but the budgetary constraints could force them to make changes for the better.&quot;    Network officials say they will do fewer &quot;here they come, there they go&quot; broadcasts, consisting mostly of visuals of candidates' whistle-stop campaigning. &quot;We'll be doing more issues-oriented stories, partly because they're less expensive,&quot; says NBC's Mr. Angotti. &quot;The cost restrictions will assist us in making improvements and resisting the picture traps.&quot;    Instead of permanently attaching crews to each candidate, the big three networks plan to place staff throughout Iowa and New Hampshire, the sites of the first presidential contests, and catch candidates as they travel. The networks plan to use this approach at least until Super Tuesday, March 8, when the field of candidates will likely be much smaller.    In the meantime, the networks are trying different tactics. Richard Cohen, CBS senior producer of political coverage, says his network will place a single &quot;political coordinator&quot; with each candidate. ABC will also assign one person per campaign, someone who will be, says political director Hal Bruno, a &quot;cross between an off-air reporter and producer, who can handle a small camera in case of an emergency.&quot;    CBS plans to offer a new, five-minute nightly news segment during the early primaries instead of its usual barrage of candidates on the stump. From newsrooms in Des Moines and later in New Hampshire, veteran correspondents Bob Schieffer and Bruce Morton will summarize events, focusing as much on their own analysis as the candidates' activities.    Network executives acknowledge that dropping man-to-man coverage risks missing out on video of significant actions or remarks by the candidates. But the executives think they can fill such gaps by making heavier use of tape from the networks' local affiliates. NBC, for example, in recent months has paid about half the cost of expensive satellite up-link trucks for some affiliates so that they can transmit pictures for the network during the political year.    &quot;The weakness is we're not body-watching . . . in case something bad happens or a mistake is made,&quot; says Mr. Bruno of ABC.    Presidential campaigns already feel the effects of the network's cutbacks. Even an event yielding dazzling video footage is no guarantee of coverage, says Daniel Mariaschin, press secretary for long-shot GOP candidate Alexander Haig: &quot;We have to give advance notice if we want to get the networks, and we have to have something important to say.&quot;    The network cutbacks may also help explain the proliferation of candidate debates, says Dayton Duncan, a former Mondale press aide who is writing a book on the New Hampshire primary. &quot;Candidates are more willing to debate because it's the only place they know a congregation of the networks and other press will be,&quot; he says.    One side effect of the networks' cutbacks has been to boost the importance of Cable News Network and C-Span, which have jumped in to fill the void. CNN, with an insatiable appetite for material to fill its 24-hour service, has had staff in Des Moines for two months, and recently launched a new nightly show called &quot;Inside Politics,&quot; devoted entirely to the 1988 election. C-Span, the public service cable network, has been carrying live and recorded political speeches and events.    &quot;Our field staff is more excited to see a crew from CNN than CBS,&quot; says Michael McCurry, press secretary for Democrat Bruce Babbitt. &quot;If the network shows up, they're collecting string for a lay-of-the-land story; if CNN comes in, they'll put it on the tube that night.&quot;    Exposure isn't the only area where the network cutbacks have hurt, the campaigns say; their finances also have suffered. Typically, a campaign could pay for most of the cost of chartering an airplane by charging the traveling press one-and-a-half times normal commercial airfare. With so fewer network people traveling this year, &quot;some campaigns are calling us desperately,&quot; says CBS's Mr. Cohen. &quot;They are so used to networks' taking care of their expenses.&quot;    Because networks are deploying fewer camera crews, dark-horse candidates are getting nervous. They fear if the networks focus only on the perceived leading contenders, they will never get their chance on network news, making the winnowing-out process occur that much earlier than it otherwise would because of primary results. &quot;We have to start getting on the news in January, or Babbitt won't be elected president,&quot; says Mr. McCurry, his press secretary.
