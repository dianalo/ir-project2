Nicaragua's incursion into neighboring Honduras has embarrassed several moderate House Democrats who have tipped the balance in previous votes on aid to the Contras. Last month, these lawmakers helped defeat President Reagan's request for $36 million in Contra aid. But in the wake of the new Sandinista attacks, they now are urging an early resumption of aid to the rebels.    The administration is poised to send legislators a new aid package. The White House says it hasn't decided when to submit the package; some State Department officials want the request to go to lawmakers immediately.    Still, even some staunch Contra supporters, such as Sen. John McCain (R., Ariz.), worry that President Reagan's decision to send U.S. forces to Honduras in a show of solidarity with that country may have harmed the administration's position. They fear the move may create concerns about whether the troops will be involved in combat, and raise doubts about the White House's already badly eroded credibility with lawmakers.    Many of the moderate House Democrats are outraged that Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega launched the military action just days before the Sandinistas and Contras are scheduled to hold direct talks. The military thrust appears to realize the moderate Democrats' worst election-year nightmare -- that Republicans will accuse them of abetting the Sandinistas' effort to eliminate their opposition by force and consolidate power.    &quot;It doesn't demonstrate much good faith,&quot; said Rep. Jim Slattery (D., Kansas), a member of the so-called swing group of House moderates. &quot;It was an incredibly stupid mistake by Ortega.&quot;    Following a closed briefing by administration officials, Sen. David Boren (D., Okla.), chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee and a Contra-aid backer, said, &quot;There's absolutely no question that there are Sandinista troops in Honduras.&quot; And, he added, &quot;It is absolutely clear that this was well planned.&quot;    The senators were told that a Sandinista military buildup along the Honduran border that eventually totaled 4,000 to 5,000 troops began in early March. U.S. analysts said this week's attack was designed to wipe out Contra base camps and supplies inside Honduras. U.S. aid to the rebels ended Feb. 29.    One analyst said the Sandinistas used old Soviet transport planes -- known as Antonov 26s -- rigged for bombing missions to drop 500-pound bombs on the Contra camps.    The analysts said that as of midday yesterday about 2,000 Sandinista troops remained inside Honduras, and that there weren't any signs of an imminent withdrawal. So far, they said, the Sandinistas haven't succeeded in destroying the Contra's supply base. &quot;From everything we've seen so far, the Contras have done well in defending their supply cache,&quot; said Rep. Dave McCurdy (D., Okla.), another swing voter.    The U.S. yesterday began flying the first of about 3,200 troops into Honduras in what the Pentagon termed a &quot;military readiness exercise&quot; designed to serve as a &quot;deterrent&quot; to further Sandinista incursions. C-141 transport planes loaded with troops from the U.S. 82nd Airborne Division landed throughout the day at the U.S. base in Palmerola, Honduras, about 170 miles from the combat in the Bocay Valley.    Meanwhile, Pentagon officials said the Honduran military yesterday launched aircraft attacks around that country's border with Nicaragua.    Secretary of State George Shultz told the Senate Budget Committee that Congress's recent rejection of Contra aid emboldened the Sandinistas and helped instigate the incursion.    If the swing voters' disillusionment with the Sandinistas leads Congress to change its mind about Contra aid, lawmakers are most likely to provide the rebels so-called nonlethal aid. Earlier this month, the House rejected a proposal backed by the Democratic leadership to provide $16.2 million in such assistance.    But it isn't clear whether the administration can win approval of a &quot;lethal aid&quot; package that includes guns and ammunition. The White House still has credibility problems with Congress following last year's Iran-Contra scandal. There was general agreement that the intelligence information being provided to lawmakers yesterday was accurate, though.    In the end, Managua's actions may determine how far Congress is willing to go. &quot;There is great anger at Ortega again,&quot; said Rep. Bill Richardson (D., N.M.). &quot;And that is driving the Democrats more than the administration's sabre-rattling.&quot;    ---   Jeffrey H. Birnbaum contributed to this article. </TEXT></DOC>
