This time around,however, the lag in business outlays may last even longerthan usual.   And that's important because capital spending isimportant. It enables companies to reduce costs, improveproducts, increase employment and generally promote economicgrowth.</LP><TEXT>   In the first quarter of this year, the worst of therecession, the figures on capital spending were dismal.Nonresidential fixed investment, consisting of structures andproducers' durable equipment, fell at an inflation-adjustedannual rate of 22.6%. Since then, business outlays havelargely flattened out, but most analysts see littleimprovement over the next several quarters.   The 52 analysts interviewed monthly by Blue Chip EconomicIndicators, a Sedona, Ariz., newsletter, on average expectbusiness spending to rise only 2.9% in 1992.                                                                                                          Several factors are being blamed for the forecasts of aweak rebound. The most obvious one is the unusually slow paceof the economic recovery. The analysts at the investment firmof Kidder, Peabody andamp; Co. say that a recovery is indeed underway but add that it &quot;will be quite moderate relative to anyof the prior postwar recoveries.&quot; They predictinflation-adjusted growth of only a little more than 2% in1992.   The pace of the recovery is not only slow, it's uncertain.In September, the leading indicators of economic activitydeclined for the first time since last January. And althoughthe Commerce Department recently reported that theinflation-adjusted gross national product rose at an annualrate of 2.4% in the third quarter, it also noted that theeconomy was slowing down toward the quarter's end. And someeconomists still expect the U.S. to slip back into recession.   Even some attempts at optimism fall a little flat. Theeconomists at Bank Credit Analyst, a respected Canadianpublication, assure their readers that the U.S. does not face&quot;a 1930s-type of generalized depression.&quot; That sort of faintenthusiasm doesn't encourage capital spending.   In addition, the recent poor performance of corporateprofits makes it more difficult for companies to financeplant and equipment outlays. This newspaper's quarterlyprofits survey finds a 23% drop in the third period from ayear earlier.   &quot;Corporate profits have borne much of the brunt of thelatest recession,&quot; say the economists at First InterstateBancorp., of Los Angeles. And the First Interstate analystslook for only modest profit gains in 1992 and 1993,commenting that &quot;the ability of most firms to raise pricesaggressively will be limited during the next two years by alower inflation environment and a generally moderate growthof sales.&quot;   The analysts at the Jerome Levy Economics Institute atBard College say &quot;poor sales and profits increasingly willprompt many firms to scale back&quot; their spending.                                                                                                          If profits aren't sufficient to finance new plant andequipment, businesses may try to borrow the necessary funds.But that has become somewhat more difficult, too, even thoughthe Federal Reserve, in its effort to spur the recovery, hasbeen cutting the discount rate, the fee it charges on loansto member banks, and pushing down the federal funds rate, thefee banks charge on loans to one another.                                                                                                          The Fed hopes that its rate cuts will persuade banks tooffer cheaper long-term loans to business firms. But bankshave been slow to cut their long-term rates. Moreover, thebanks' troubles in recent years have made them especiallycautious about lending -- at any interest rate. And bankregulators, sensitive to criticism that they didn't monitorbanks carefully in recent years, have turned cautious, too.   Through tax-law changes as well, the government has madeit more difficult for businesses to finance investment. For awhile, the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981 sharply reducedthe return a capital investment needed to cover taxes andprovide a profit, but tax increases in 1982, 1984 and 1986cut back these incentives.   The 1981 tax law did a great deal to encourageconstruction of new factories and office buildings. Much ofthe construction was carefully planned, but much wasn't.                                                                                                          Now, business structures are in oversupply in many places.Economists at the research firm of DRI/McGraw-Hill comment:&quot;Suppliers to nonresidential business construction should notbe counting on a recovery in a matter of months. Depending onwhich regions and market segments they serve, it could takequarters or even years.&quot;                                                                                                          Even some laudable moves by many companies over the pastseveral years aren't helping the capital-spending outlook asmuch as might have been expected. Many companies have cutcosts vigorously, in part by trying to limit productioncapacity to what is actually needed.   However, the latest recession has shown, once again, thatsound plans don't always pan out. Manufacturers still arereporting capacity-utilization rates under 80% and thus haveonly a limited need for new plant and equipment. Someanalysts do make an exception in the case of data-processingequipment, though. Those at Standard andamp; Poor's see &quot;spendingon computers and related goods picking up early in 1992.&quot;   But overall, the obstacles to an upswing incapital-equipment spending clearly seem more powerful thanthe inducements. Those problems appear likely to reinforcethe many others now hobbling the recovery.</TEXT></DOC>
