 That dip in the pool felt great!andP;  I'mwriting this from the comfort of my RV, now parked by the shore of LakeMarian, South Carolina.andP;  Above the pines there's a sunny blue sky.andP;  Only thestreak of a rain storm, about three inches wide, pouring from the rooftop airconditioner, reminds me of the sweltering heat outside.andP;  The Great TemplateTour's finally begun.andM;Wife, kids, and computers have all been packed into an 8-foot x 31-foot motorhome--we're spending the summer touring user groups, trying to sell somesoftware (more to come on that subject).andP;  You may be reading this ten weeksfrom now, as we return home.andP;  Right now, though, we're in the middle of thefirst week, and still shaking down all the systems.andM;&quot;Linda,&quot; I complain, &quot;this filtered water sure comes out slowly.&quot;andP;  Sheanswers, &quot;The filter's stowed underneath the sink.andP;  Why don't you installit?&quot;andM;Tower converts to desktopandM;My &quot;office&quot; still includes a laser printer attached to a 386 tower.andP;  Theformer stows neatly under the fold-out couch, while the latter has on itsside below a two-foot-square table.andP;  (You have to take it apart to make surethat the disk drives are set right side up.andP;  Lay one on the wrong side andit's dead.)andM;A tale of two citiesandM;So far, I've made presentations to the Washington, D.C.andP;  and Raleigh, NorthCarolina Clipper groups.andP;  The first was a complete bomb.andP;  No one understood aword I said.andP;  And it's not because they were stupid.andP;  It's yours truly whoblew the presentation--badly.andP;  Mark Bachrach, head of the D.C.andP;  group, tookme aside afterward and suggested I forget explaining and just build a samplesystem.andM;Which is exactly what I did in Raleigh.andP;  And it went over beautifully.andM;Microsoft killed meandM;So what went wrong in the first place?andP;  It's Gates' fault.andP;  Jill Jones, acolleague, had very kindly volunteered her weekend time to help me reduce mytechnobabble to English.andP;  When the demo software was finally perfect, justbefore leaving to see Jill, I ported it all from my 386 to the 286 I'll beusing for demos.andP;  Guess what?andP;  Nothing works!andP;  Near panic.andP;  I call Jill andcancel--then work on into the night.andP;  Finally, the differences are eliminateduntil one simple fact emerges.andP;  My stuff won't run under DOS 3.2.andP;  It runsfine under 3.3.andP;  After hours of labor and with my anger swelled by repressingall the English unfit for my daughters' ears, I finally get a new build thatruns under both versions.andP;  (For 3.2, I get FUNCky with Dirk Lesko'sSETHANDLES().)andM;So, we all know that 3.2 was junk and we ought to upgrade, right?andP;  But didMicrosoft ever lift a finger?andP;  Are all those old 3.2s going to upgrade?andO;Forget it.andP;  If you want to sell DP systems, you've no choice but to supportboth.andP;  Thanks, Bill.andM;Microsoft revisitedandM;For years I spoke my mind on the subject of a certain large softwarecompany's technical incompetence.andP;  (Hint: a database software concern.)andP;  Butthey're flat on their back.andP;  So now I'm going to bash Microsoft once a monthuntil they start to behave like a responsible, competent operating-systemfirm.andM;Except this month.andP;  This month I'll go for twice.andM;I was talking to my friend Fred.andP;  Fred's a reporter for a major trade paper.andO;(This story is reported as accurately as I can, with the exception of Fred'sname.)andP;  Seems there are stories going around about Windows 3.0 trashing FATs.andO;And Fred is real upset because every time he gets to someone he thinks fellvictim, they're not talking.andP;  They don't confirm; they don't deny; they justdon't talk to the press.andP;  Fred thinks Microsoft is getting there first.andM;Doug Carlson, CEO at Broderbund, told me about the time they released anApple II product that, when used with a particular brand of hard disk with aparticular telecomm program running in the background, could trash the disk.andO;They recalled every copy and organized a task force to call every registereduser.andP;  All this in spite of the fact that the offending combination wasincredibly rare.andP;  And, of course, they updated everyone for free.andP;  Tell methis is what Microsoft would do.andP;  Please.andM;Devcon magic fills the airandM;My friends just back from the Nantucket Developer Conference tell me it was agreat success.andP;  Everyone's very excited about Clipper 5.0--which may beshipping before you read this.andM;When my friends got back from last fall's Fox devcon, they told me it was agreat success too--we're still waiting for a Fox-like multiuser FoxPro.andM;My friends back from the prior fall's A-T-sponsored &quot;Meeting of the Minds&quot;told me it was a great success.andP;  Will the A-T Professional Compiler pleasephone home?andM;&quot;In days of old, when magic filled the air...&quot; the song goes.andP;  What is itabout these things?andP;  Do people spend two to three thousand just for theparties?andM;Templates, anyone?andM;Just to make sure that my last two years working with U12 templates werewasted, Russ Freeland is trying to ace us all by turning Scrimage into atemplate product.andP;  Only he wants to use the template language included indBASE IV.andP;  Why spend years coding when a simple license will work?andM;For anyone else, this would be a &quot;no brainer.&quot;andP;  But for A-T this could be themillennia.andP;  Have they really learned to count to ten?andP;  I hope not.andP;  I don'twant Russ' competition.andM;Getting abstractandM;I'm a working nerd.andP;  My code runs; I'm happy.andP;  It doesn't; I'm not.andP;  Theory?andO;I know most of it, and pay attention to very little.andP;  So guess what?andO;Surprise, surprise--here's one of the text books that really works.andM;Date, Volume 2 [To the Editor: I believe I'm referring to C. J. Date, AnIntroduction to Database Theory, Volume II, but this RV park doesn't have acopy in its library] suggests that the best key is an abstract key.andP;  Giveevery record an abstract, unique key, and it'll be a lot easier to maintainreferential integrity.andP;  It's one of those things that sounds like extra work,until you try it.andP;  Then it makes your life so, so very, very simple.andM;I'm using a numeric key, eight digits long.andP;  I assign the first record10,000,000 (so that the columns are aligned, no matter how QD my report).andP;  Oneach APPEND, you just add 1 to the last key assigned.andP;  I keep a little DBFthat holds the highest number assigned--so I never reassign a deleted key.andO;Try it once and you'll never look back.andP;  Trust me.andM;The big breakthroughandM;On one of my first two stops (I can't even tell you which) I talked with abeta tester for what could be the biggest product of the decade.andP;  It's a...andM;Oops, sorry...Everyone's off for the pool.andP;  Talk to you next month.andM;Martin L. Rinehart is the author of The Data Entry Templates.andP;  He haspromised us an in-person demo at the end of July, when the Great TemplateTour arrives in San Diego.andP;  He's also the author of the book/disk package, AnIntroduction to Template Programming and The Menu Templates.andP;  Contact him onthe Data Based Advisor Readers Exchange BBS, (619) 270-2042, or send yourletters to Data Based Advisor, 4010 Morena Blvd., Suite 200, San Diego,Calif.andP;  92117.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
