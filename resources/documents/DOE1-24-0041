Shizuoka Prefecture was selected; annual power production by30 KWP solar cell was 44,078 KWH; annual power production by 2 unitsof 18.5 KWP wind power generator was 68,444 KWH. Both energy are theenergy available only in the daytime, and the pattern of load in thefacility horticulture balanced with the energy distribution characteristics.The system is constructed with a hybrid of a solar cell and a wind powergenerator, and efficiently absorbs the energy of light and wind by thecurrent control. Evaluation of an energy used for the estimated independentpower source indicated the possibility of energy-saving (on the basisof heavy oil A) of 16 kl per annum, i.e., electric power of 79,700 KWH.(1 fig, 1 tab)</TEXT></DOC>
