The purpose is tofacilitate standardizing the interfaces between these programs, to reducethe possibility for errors, and to simplify code maintenance. Severalschemes have been studied and a tentative proposal is given. The possibilityof the Particle Data Group providing decay tables and material propertiestables is discussed.</TEXT></DOC>
