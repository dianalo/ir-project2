The report estimates rates of temperature increase of the earthdue to CO{sub 2} plus the other greenhouse gases. Estimates of the greenhouseeffect arising from unrestrained gas emissions and a highly sensitiveclimate or strong global restraint of emissions and a low climate sensitivityrange from 0.8 to 0.06{sup 0}C per decade. Long term policies that thereport recommends should be reexamined are increased efficiency in theconsumption of energy and a shift toward alternative energy to reduceCO{sub 2} emissions and reforestation to remove CO{sub 2} from the atmosphere.</TEXT></DOC>
