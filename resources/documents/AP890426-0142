Passage of the bills, expected next month, will clear the way toestablishing diplomatic relations between the Polish People'sRepublic and the Vatican. The Vatican for years has refused togrant relations until the local church's status is resolved.   Proclaiming the start of a ``new era,'' Prime MinisterMieczyslaw F. Rakowski introduced the package in a speech to the460-member Sejm, or parliament, that dwelt on the long, rockyhistory of church-state relations after communists came to power in1944. The legislation was agreed to by church negotiators earlierthis month.   To a large degree it formalizes freedoms that the church hadalready won in practice for itself and the more than 90 percent ofPoland's 38 million people who consider themselves Roman Catholic.   One bill defines the state's attitude toward the church as asovereign organization operating within the constitution but freeto manage all its internal affairs. A second bill grants equalrights to all denominations, bars discrimination based on religionand guarantees freedom of worship. The third bill entitles clergyto state old-age pensions.   The bills were referred to an extraordinary committee pendingthe next meeting of the Sejm in May.   ``It is a historical event,'' said Professor Stanislaw Stomma, aCatholic lawyer and former Sejm deputy who participated in many ofthe early battles with the state over church issues.   ``The negotiations were long because of political reasons, butnow the situation is mature and it is a wise step on both sides, agreat new historical fact,'' he said in an interview with TheAssociated Press.   Rakowski told the Sejm, ``It will be up to historians ... todetermine the scope of the responsibility and the fault of thesides which participated in the historic argument over the role ofthe Catholic church in the socialist system. Today we have thosearguments behind us. We live in a different era.''   But he implied that much of the blame rested with theauthorities. ``Generally, revolutions do not tolerate dialogue,''Rakowski said.   Rakowski noted that meetings between the head of the CommunistParty and the head of the Polish church were so rare in the 1970sas to be ``sensations every time.'' But in the last eight years, hesaid, First Secretary Wojciech Jaruzelski and primate CardinalJozef Glemp have met 14 times. Contacts between provincial partyleaders and local bishops also have become routine, he said.   After World War II, communist leaders abrogated the prewaragreement giving the legal basis for church activities in Poland,and the episcopate was forced to wage a constant battle for thechurch's survival in the years that followed.   In the Stalinist-era drive to strip the society of religion,church properties were seized, heavy taxes were levied on parishes,seminarians were drafted into the army, bishops faced show trialsand the unbowed primate, Cardinal Stefan Wyszynski of Warsaw, washeld under guard in harsh conditions for three years in 1953-56.   Unions of ``patriotic priests'' opposed to the church hierarchywere set up, and PAX, a Catholic lay group loyal to theauthorities, was created with the right to publish religious works.   Wyszynski was released in October 1956 as Wladyslaw Gomulka cameto power, replacing the Stalinist Boleslaw Bierut. But Gomulkacontinued a cold war against the church, virtually forbiddingconstruction of churches and attempting to restrict the teaching ofcatechism to children.</TEXT></DOC>
