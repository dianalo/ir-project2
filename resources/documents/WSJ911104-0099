After two days of contentious and increasingly partisandebate on the bill, Banking Committee Chairman Henry Gonzalez(D., Texas) gave the legislation only a 50-50 chance of Housepassage. Rep. Chalmers Wylie of Ohio, the ranking Republicanon the House banking panel, said the outcome is &quot;too close tocall.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   If the administration succeeds, the sweeping banking billwould be returned to the Banking Committee for redrafting.Treasury officials concede that a revised bill probably wouldcontain little more than the necessary recapitalization ofthe bank deposit insurance fund, and a new set of bankregulations to reduce the risk of bank failure and to tightenthe regulation of foreign banks.   House defeat could also increase the chances of a narrowbill from the Senate, which is scheduled to start debatingbank reform on Wednesday.   It is unclear whether a narrower bill also would allowbanks to set up nationwide branch networks, one of the keyreforms the administration proposed in its February blueprintfor a more profitable and stable banking system. The Housewill vote on several branch banking proposals today before itconsiders final passage of the entire bill.   But it is nearly certain that in its effort to produce abill before a scheduled Thanksgiving adjournment, the Housewould drop efforts to rewrite current laws governing bankpowers to sell securities and insurance. The Treasury hadproposed allowing bank affiliates to offer a wider range offinancial services by expanding their powers to sellsecurities and insurance. But the insurance and investmentbanking industries, working with Rep. John Dingell (D.,Mich.), chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee,outmuscled the administration and produced a measure that theTreasury claims will actually roll back current bank powersto sell securities and insurance, thus protecting thoseindustries at the expense of banks. As a result, theadministration, the American Bankers Association and manylarge banks are working to defeat the bill in order to killthe new restrictions.   The outlook for the bill is murky because lawmakers findthemselves besieged by strong lobbying groups with generouscampaign funds urging them to vote on highly complexlegislation that raises fears of another savings-and-loanfiasco. Many lawmakers fear that the bill's provision tobolster the depleted bank deposit insurance fund with $70billion in new borrowing authority will someday come back tohaunt them as the first step toward a taxpayer bailout of thebanks, even though the banking industry insists that itintends to pay off the loans.   &quot;Nobody wants to vote for this piece of legislation,&quot;House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt (D., Mo.) said Friday.&quot;But we're not leaving here this year until a recap of thefund takes place at a minimum&quot; to allow continued FederalDeposit Insurance Corp. protection of deposits in failingbanks.   On Friday, Democrats handily defeated along party lines aRepublican effort to kill the bill, after Rep. Newt Gingrichof Georgia, the second-ranking Republican, angered Democratsby accusing Speaker Thomas Foley of misleading Republicans ona key vote. But many Democrats who voted to support theSpeaker dislike the bill and may vote against its finalpassage.   Also on Friday, the House adopted by voice vote anamendment by Rep. Jim Leach (R., Iowa) that would requirebanks that want to expand by setting up interstate branchsystems to meet significantly higher capital standards thancurrent minimums. Banks in holding companies that want tooffer expanded securities and insurance services also wouldhave to meet higher capital standards.   As written, the rule would bar Citicorp and other largebanks with low equity capital from expanding until they raisenew capital, which is a cushion against failure. &quot;The No. 1deposit insurance reform this Congress should consider ishigher capital standards,&quot; Mr. Leach said.   In other action, the House defeated a proposal by Rep.Joseph Kennedy (D., Mass.) that would prevent banks frominterstate branching unless they could show they were meetingthe credit needs of their communities. The banking industrylobbied hard against the measure, which also would havetightened enforcement of nondiscriminatory lending laws,claiming that the changes would saddle banks with costly newpaper work.   The House also defeated an amendment by Rep. Barney Frank(D., Mass.) that would have eliminated a current growth capon about 40 limited-service banks owned by companies such asAmerican Express Co., Sears, Roebuck andamp; Co., General ElectricCo. and Merrill Lynch andamp; Co.</TEXT></DOC>
