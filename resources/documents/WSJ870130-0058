Chairman Don Johnston's desk. &quot;The Marines gave me that,&quot; he says. &quot;I thought I'd pull it out now.&quot;    He could use it. JWT and Mr. Johnston are still reeling from the ouster of his hand-picked successor, Joseph W. O'Donnell, last week, after Mr. O'Donnell presented a buyout proposal and suggested stripping Mr. Johnston of his day-to-day operating control. Mr. Johnston assumed Mr. O'Donnell's duties as chief executive officer of JWT's flagship unit, J. Walter Thompson Co.    Now JWT, which owns ad agencies and public relations firms, is rumored to be a takeover target. Its stock price climbed this week amid speculation about more possible bids. JWT's Hill andamp; Knowlton Inc. public relations unit also was rumored to be on the block. Robert Dilenschneider, Hill andamp; Knowlton's president and chief executive, conceded yesterday that &quot;Hill andamp; Knowlton is being approached&quot; by suitors, but said, &quot;I am informing Don Johnston of every single approach, and there isn't an ounce of truth to the rumor that Hill andamp; Knowlton is going to be sold.&quot;    Ad agency competitors, Mr. Johnston says, are circling &quot;like sharks&quot; in hopes of picking off some of its prestigious advertising clients, which include International Business Machines Corp., Ford Motor Co., and, yes, the Marines. And some industry executives are debating whether Mr. Johnston's handling of the situation makes him a hero or a fool.    In what is likely to add fuel to that debate, Mr. Johnston says he plans to stay put as Thompson's chief executive and won't choose a successor to head the unit anytime soon. &quot;I'm getting back in the business,&quot; he says in his first public comments on the upheaval, beaming despite the strain of the past week's events. &quot;The first thing this company needs is stability,&quot; he says.    Further concentrating Mr. Johnston's control over the Thompson unit, JWT said yesterday that it fired John E. Peters, Thompson's president and chief operating officer, and that he &quot;will not be replaced.&quot; The dismissal of Mr. Peters, 55 years old and a 30-year Thompson veteran, was widely expected because of his close relationship with Mr. O'Donnell. JWT said in a statement that Mr. Peters was discharged &quot;following discussions&quot; about the O'Donnell incident, and that JWT &quot;doesn't anticipate any further departures related to the matter.&quot;    Under the Thompson unit's rules, executives must retire at the age of 60. Mr. Johnston turns 60 in March. &quot;Forget the rules,&quot; he says. &quot;I'm going to ignore it.&quot;    He adds, however, that his JWT board contract runs only for three more years, and &quot;I would hope this company is in shape that I could walk out of here at 63.&quot;    Critics are likely to pounce on Mr. Johnston's decision to remain in direct control of the Thompson unit. He already has been criticized in some circles for concentrating too much power in his own hands. They say his penchant for control has hurt the company because, while he has encouraged creativity and helped make JWT one of the best-regarded creative agencies, he has failed to remedy the company's anemic earnings and paltry profit margins.    &quot;He hasn't been willing to accept a partner in running the agencies in those areas where he is weak -- financial controls and business organization,&quot; contends Stephen Kahler, a Darien, Conn., consultant and former ad agency financial executive. &quot;You need it. It's a huge organization.&quot;    Mr. Johnston, he adds, &quot;can be proud of his record with clients. He can't look back and be proud of his record for the shareholders.&quot; While JWT's revenue under Mr. Johnston has steadily increased, the company's earnings have lagged. JWT earned just $2 a share in 1985, compared with $2.24 a share in 1984, and analysts now say that 1986 results will be only $1 a share or less. Pre-tax profit margins have recently only been about 4%, compared with 11% to 12% at comparable but more financially savvy agencies.    Mr. Johnston defends his financial performance overall, though he concedes that in 1986 some mistakes were made. &quot;Coming into 1986, quite frankly, we were too optimistic,&quot; he said. &quot;We'd had about a 17% growth rate (in revenue) and we'd been hiring. It began to catch up with us. I admit we didn't react as quickly as we should have. We didn't believe it would be as bad as it was, and we weren't sure we wanted to let go&quot; of high-quality new hires. He adds that the company is now paying &quot;more attention to costs.&quot; He didn't elaborate.    He also denies trying to concentrate control over the company. &quot;I set up a successor, I took hands off&quot; of Thompson, where he had been chief executive until last March, and &quot;I told people I didn't want to work more than a couple more years,&quot; he says.    Mr. Johnston declines to discuss specific reasons for firing his designated successor, Mr. O'Donnell, who has said that he was only passing along the buyout and management change proposals for discussion. Mr. Johnston says that &quot;it was more than a suggestion.&quot;    Industry executives have speculated that there was more to the rift than the proposals, and that the two men disagreed on, among other things, Thompson's activities abroad. &quot;You always have problems. He's younger (43), he's less experienced,&quot; Mr. Johnston says, without elaborating. &quot;But I never second-guessed his decisions. Here's a guy I picked as my successor, I groomed him. If somebody asked me a month ago, 'How do you feel about it, did you make the right choice?', I'd say 'absolutely' . . . which is why it was a shock.&quot;    In any case, Mr. Johnston is the topic of voluble debate because of his actions. Some executives in the financial and advertising community say that Mr. O'Donnell was on the right track. &quot;This man came up and said the emperor is wearing no clothes -- and got fired,&quot; Mr. Kahler, the consultant, says.    And a senior JWT executive says that, among fellow executives, &quot;There is some support for what was trying to be done, and disappointment at how it was done, or the lack of effectiveness.&quot;    Yet Mr. Johnston's supporters are just as vocal. David L. Yunich, a JWT director and retired vice chairman of R.H. Macy andamp; Co., says Mr. Johnston is an &quot;outstanding&quot; executive. He say the buyout and management change that Mr. O'Donnell presented amounted to a &quot;harebrained scheme.&quot;    Indeed, Mr. Johnston has maintained an almost sterling reputation until recently. A polished, immaculate man who has been with Thompson all of his working life, he became chairman of the ad agency in 1974 and has been head of JWT since the holding company was formed in 1980. He has earned a reputation as the consummate advertising man, with some of the smoothest client-contact skills in the business.    Phillip Samper, vice chairman and executive officer of Eastman Kodak Co., a Thompson client for 55 years, says of Mr. Johnston: &quot;I've always found him an excellent source of advice. I've probably talked to Don about every new product for the past 15 years.&quot;    Even competitors speak well of him. Philip Geier, chairman and chief executive of Interpublic Group of Cos., calls him &quot;a very honest, forthright operator.&quot;    Mr. Yunich says, &quot;An advertising company is made up of a lot of creative prima donnas.&quot; When Mr. Yunich joined the JWT board in 1974, he says: &quot;I was overwhelmed by the naivete of the operation in terms of financials. During (Mr. Johnston's) administration, he transformed all of that.&quot;    But Mr. Johnston has had a cooler reception from the financial community. Emma Hill, an analyst with Wertheim andamp; Co., says, &quot;The way he answers questions is very curt, like 'I don't need to give any explanation.' Most CEOs get up and want to sell their company.&quot;    Other analysts note that JWT provides fewer financial details about its far-flung, world-wide operations than do other agencies, making JWT harder to understand.    Mr. Johnston also has had more problems on the financial side than on the advertising side of the business. When the latest problems emerged, JWT had barely recovered from a 1982 scandal in which financial irregularities in its television syndication unit led to a $10.7 million charge to close the business. JWT also had to slash $30 million off profit, wiping out working capital. A $50 million libel suit filed by the former head of the syndication unit against the company and some executives is still pending.    Moreover, the events of the past week are throwing into high relief what some industry executives see as a disturbingly large executive turnover at JWT. For example, Burton Manning, who had been chairman and chief executive of Thompson's U.S. arm, left last year. Mr. Manning is credited with leading Thompson's creative renaissance. Ironically, he left when he didn't get the top spot at Thompson, which went instead to Mr. O'Donnell. Industry executives say there now is no clear future leader at JWT.    Part of JWT's financial problems also apparently stem from the high turnover. The company has had four chief financial officers since 1980, for example, and some analysts question whether the finance chiefs are given enough authority to cut costs. &quot;You can put as many CFOs in there as you want . . . but if they don't have the support of the board and of Don Johnston, they won't make headway,&quot; says Andrew Wallach, an analyst with PaineWebber Inc.    &quot;I don't think you run an ad agency by having the top financial guy tell (the head of an agency office) how he has to allocate his costs,&quot; responds Mr. Johnston. &quot;The CFO's duty is to help, to monitor, to suggest ways it can be done.&quot;    Meanwhile, Mr. Johnston must keep JWT's employees satisfied. He has held meetings with a number of them, and will meet with the Thompson unit's board at a special meeting today. &quot;Most people are just sorry (the O'Donnell incident) happened, because it has nothing to do with advertising,&quot; says Bert Metter, chief executive of Thompson's U.S. arm. &quot;There's certainly sympathy for Joe (O'Donnell), who was trying to do the right thing. And there's sympathy for Don (Johnston), who's got a lot of burdens now.&quot;    Some JWT executives, however, would be only too happy to see Mr. O'Donnell's ill-fated proposals lead to JWT's going private. Says one: &quot;I think you find sympathy&quot; with being closely held, &quot;so you could do your work and not worry about these other matters.&quot;    In fact, Mr. Johnston acknowledges that the JWT board has considered taking the company private before. &quot;In the early years (of Thompson's operating as a publicly held company), I thought about it a lot because I thought that's why we got into trouble, because we had other things to worry about,&quot; aside from advertising, he says.    And now? &quot;That's one thing we've looked at in the past,&quot; he says. &quot;That's one of the things we're always looking at.&quot;    ---   JWT's Disappointing Earnings    (In millions of dollars)    1983         $17.6    1984         $20.5    1985         $18.5    1986*        $10.5   *Estimated by L.F.
