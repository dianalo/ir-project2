Wisconsin Gov. Tommy G. Thompson, at a meeting with Lujan, askedthat the federal government assist the state in trying to reach anegotiated settlement with the Chippewas that might curtail thepractice by the Indians of spearfishing on land that once belongedto them.   The Indians hold the right to spearfish on the land undertreaties that date back more than a century, but sport fishermenhave loudly protested the practice, saying the practice cuts intothe number of fish they are allowed to catch.   Protests in recent weeks resulted in scores of arrests.   Lujan told the governor he will direct a senior departmentofficial to look into what help the federal government mightprovide. He said Pat Ragsdale, acting assistant secretary forIndian affairs, will work with the governor and the Indians as towhat specific steps might be taken, spokesmen reported.   After the meeting with Thompson and members of Wisconsin'scongressional delegation, the secretary issued a statement sayinghe will ``explore means by which the (Interior) department couldfacilitate efforts to achieve an agreement with the tribes thatwould ease tensions (over the spearfishing) and avert futureconflicts.''   Lujan provided no specific action that might lead to asettlement.   ``I don't think the tribes will want to give up spearfishing. Ireally don't know what we'll be able to work out,'' said oneInterior official, speaking on condition that he not be identifiedfurther.   In addition to Thompson, those who attended the meeting withLujan were Sens. Robert W. Kasten Jr., R-Wis., and Herbert Kohl,D-Wis.; Democratic Rep. David Obey and Republican Reps. SteveGunderson and Toby Roth.   Most of this spring's Chippewa spearfishing had ended lastweekend. Costs for protecting the Chippewa may total as much as $1million, twice as much as last year, because of the larger groupsof spearfishing opponents that gathered at boat landings used bythe Indians, state officials say.   There were more than 170 arrests, primarily of those who opposedthe Chippewa spearfishing that is permitted under 19th centurytreaties. In some cases, protesters crossed police lines en masseand were arrested. In others, they shouted obscenities or insultswith racial overtones.   ``This has been a tough time in the state,'' Obey said Monday.``What we need are a cooling down of tempers and a sobering up of alot of people.   ``Everyone recognizes that this is a problem that has to be anegotiated settlement.''   He said the federal government can help the tribes focusthemselves on what they want.   Obey said Indian disputes over land and fishing rights have beensettled through negotiation in Maine, Arizona and New York, and hewas confident the same could be done in Wisconsin.   Federal court decisions since 1983 upheld rights of the Chippewato hunt, fish, trap and harvest wild grain from off-reservationlands covering about the northern third of Wisconsin. The treatiesceded that area to the United States.   Opposition to tribal fishing grew this year when state officialsdecided the planned Chippewa catch required cutbacks in daily catchlimits on walleyes taken by sport fishermen from lakes whereIndians had speared.   Resort owners and other business people joined spearfishingopponents in boat-landing demonstrations before the most activespearfishing band, the Lac du Flambeau, announced Sunday it hadended the spring season.   The Lac du Flambeau does the most spearfishing of any of the sixbands and accounted for more than half of the 15,735 walleye thathad been caught by the Chippewa as of Monday. Tribal spokesmenblamed cold spring weather for reducing the catch from the 25,974taken last spring.   By comparison, sport fishermen bagged an estimated 672,000walleyes from the same area last year.</TEXT></DOC>
