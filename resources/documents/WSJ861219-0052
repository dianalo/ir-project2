As reported previously, terms call for Barnett to acquire United First Federal in a stock swap valued by the companies at $117 million.    Terms also call for United to be converted into a commercial bank and merged into a branch of Barnett.    United First said a federal court in Jacksonville, Fla., where Barnett is based, is scheduled to hear a suit today filed by both companies against the Federal Home Loan Bank Board and the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. The suit asks the court to invalidate an &quot;interpretive rule&quot; adopted by the Bank Board Oct. 7 that would subject the proposed merger to Bank Board review. </TEXT></DOC>
