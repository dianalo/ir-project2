The overall goal is to enhancethe ability of OSE to make positive and gradual impacts on DOE's effortsto maintain and improve security at its nuclear facilities. This goalwill be met by developing inspection and evaluation procedures that providethorough, realistic, and unbiased judgments during inspections; producereliable and rational inspection and evaluation results; are acceptablethroughout DOE; and are defensible to criticism. These inspection andevaluation procedures will eventually result in inspections that willmore realistically stress the safeguards and physical security at a sitebased on the accepted standards for that site. Underlying the approachfor developing the inspection and evaluation procedures is an informationsystem that will be used for the Information Resource Management (IRM)required to plan, conduct, and report inspections, and to perform evaluations.In addition, the information system will be used to archive inspectionand evaluation inputs as &quot;lessons learned&quot; examples and to provide inputto training inspectors.</TEXT></DOC>
