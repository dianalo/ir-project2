The court panel returned the case to the FCC, which is certain to place restrictions on radio and television programming but first must determine the ages of children to be protected and the time limits. The FCC said it plans to start a proceeding promptly to decide on these matters.    The panel's decision Friday involved a case in which Action for Children's Television, a child-advocacy group in Cambridge, Mass., joined with several broadcast groups to challenge the FCC indecency rulings as unconstitutionally vague and its setting of a &quot;safe harbor&quot; for indecent speech as arbitrary.    Before 1987, the FCC had banned indecent programming before 10 p.m., and it defined indecency as consisting of seven curse words made famous in a monologue by the comedian George Carlin. In April 1987, the agency broadened its definition of indecency to include offensive references to sexual conduct. In November, it said that such material may be broadcast only after midnight. Obscene material, which includes the standards for indecency but also must appeal to prurient interests, remains banned around the clock.    The appeals court panel affirmed the FCC's broadened definition of indecency and said the agency has the authority to protect children. The panel also affirmed an FCC warning to the New York radio personality Howard Stern that his early-morning broadcast contained indecent material.    &quot;Howard Stern must either be more careful {about what he says} or switch to a different part of the day,&quot; said Andrew Schwartzman, director of the Media Access Project, a public-interest law firm.    Nevertheless, conservative activists have been unhappy with the FCC. Last week, the Senate passed legislation directing the commission to ban indecent programming at all times. Earlier this year, President Reagan signed a law banning both indecent and obscene speech over the telephone. Diane Kilory, the FCC's general counsel, said that as a result of the appeals court panel's ruling Friday, these bans on indecent speech face a &quot;grave risk&quot; of being judged unconstitutional.    Allen Wildmon, associate director of the American Family Association, said he was &quot;disappointed&quot; with the decision. &quot;The FCC was too liberal in the first place when it set a specific time&quot; for broadcasting indecent speech, he said. The Tupelo, Miss.-based organization was formerly known as the National Federation for Decency.    But Peggy Charren, president of Action for Children's Television, praised the ruling. &quot;The important thing is to focus on a safe harbor&quot; where indecent speech is permitted, she said. &quot;Children aren't an excuse to cut down programming.&quot; She said her group would recommend that the FCC return to using a 10 p.m. cutoff for indecent speech.    The appeals court panel also told the FCC to reconsider its warnings to Pacifica Foundation Inc.'s KPFK-FM in Los Angeles and the University of California's KCSB-FM in Santa Barbara for allegedly carrying indecent material. Those broadcasts were carried after 10 p.m. </TEXT></DOC>
