The most notable was the Campaign Financing Act of 1974. Today, the influence of political money is perceived to be larger and more pernicious than ever. Congress now seems intent on redesigning the Rube Goldberg financing mechanism already in place. The problem with national politics, however, is not that the money has become too big but that the business of government has become too big.    The Senate is in a heated debate over a bill co-sponsored by Majority Leader Robert Byrd (D., W.Va.), which would provide public funds to Senate candidates who honor specified spending limits. Opponents claim this would cost $100 million to start and yesterday staved off attempts to end a filibuster against the bill.    The current system is a mess. But did big-bucks politics cause the mess, or did the &quot;reforms&quot; themselves cause it? Former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld recently decided against running for the GOP presidential nomination because current election laws put him in a Catch-22. A dark-horse candidate, even one as qualified as Mr. Rumsfeld, must spend huge amounts of money &quot;up front&quot; to have a chance in the early primaries. Such a candidate, however, has little likelihood of raising the needed funds. The result is often massive deficit spending. Wags might say this is good training in Washington's favorite sport, strong-arming contributors, but Mr. Rumsfeld points out the law prohibits these deficits from being paid off by big donors or a political party. This discourages many qualified candidates from running.    Money isn't everything in politics -- only seven of the top 15 spenders in last year's Senate races won. Incumbency may be more important. Last year, despite public disdain for Congress, more than 97% of House members seeking reelection won. As economist John Lott notes nearby, in a race between a known and an unknown quantity, the known almost always wins. (See: &quot;Campaign Cost Limit May Bankrupt 'Fairness'&quot; -- WSJ June 10, 1987)    Sitting members have a clear incentive to ensure that anynew campaign-reform law further cements them into place. Thatweakens the most effective curb against influence-peddling ina democracy-political competition.   Common Cause and other sincere supporters of campaign-finance reform fail to see that the excessive influence of money on politics is merely a symptom of the underlying problem: the government's growing power to determine economic outcomes -- subsidies, loans, protection against competition, entitlements, the defense pork barrel. Washington decides who benefits. Nobel laureate F.A. Hayek explained the process more than 40 years ago: &quot;As the coercive power of the state will alone decide who is to have what, the only power worth having will be a share in the exercise of this directing power.&quot;    The quest for that power has made Washington a boom town, filled with trendy boutiques and overpriced restaurants. As the potential for political profits increases, the ranks of those seeking them -- the ultimate inside traders -- swell.    The Washington lawyer's bar has more than 44,000 members, double the number in 1975. In 1971, New York City had twice as many trade associations as Washington. Today, the names of 3,100 associations clog the Washington phone book, far outstripping New York. They employ more than 80,000 people, and their top executives earn an average of $108,000. A fantastic 65% of the CEOs of Fortune 200 companies visit Washington at least once every two weeks. In the early 1970s fewer than 15% did.    CEOs will not stop arriving at National Airport if Congress approves public campaign financing. Lobbyists will find other ways to bend the ear of elected officials.    All this does not mean that campaign reform isn't possible. But it is time to recognize that some campaign-finance laws are polluting the system rather than cleansing it.    Sen. Ted Stevens (R., Alaska) wants candidates to be able to rely more on traditional funding sources and less on political-action committees. He would raise the individual contribution limit from $1,000 to $2,500, but that only would make up for 15 years of inflation. He also would double the amount parties can spend on candidates, and raise the limits on what individuals can give to parties.    These changes would not have a momentous impact on the high cost of modern campaigns. But they would make it easier to take on entrenched incumbents. Competitive races focus more media and voter attention on an incumbent's record -- making it harder for an officeholder to work in the shadows.    The ultimate solution to the power of the special interests is simple. Scale back the Washington colossus. Reduce the influence that can be bought with favors, flattery or financial contributions. But don't expect to hear that issue debated by members of Congress. They're too busy with &quot;campaign reform,&quot; digging defensive moats against outsiders who want to enter the system. </TEXT></DOC>
