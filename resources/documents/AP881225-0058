Western states enjoyed a white Christmas, with San Francisco andLas Vegas reporting rare snowfalls, while hundreds of Jewishvolunteers in Atlanta filled in at hospitals so that workers couldspend the holiday with their families. People left homeless by atornado in Tennessee that killed one and injured 15 on Christmas Evewere given refuge at hotels.   Church leaders urged their flocks to remember the estimated55,000 people who died and 500,000 left homeless by the Dec. 7earthquake in Armenia and the 258 people aboard Pan Am Flight 103who were killed when the plane crashed Wednesday in Scotland.   At St. Patrick's Cathedral in New York City, Cardinal JohnO'Connor said the faith of the families of plane crash victims washeartening. ``Thinking that I would console or encourage them,'' hesaid, ``I found my own faith deepened instead, by their acceptanceof suffering, their willingness to let whatever happens in thisworld happen, and to know that God still loves them very deeply.''   In Ohio, worshipers gathered at the Hindu Community Temple nearDayton to mourn the death of Om Dikshit, 54, a science professorkilled in the crash.   In Boston, Catholics have collected $460,000 for Armenianearthquake victims, with donations still coming in on Christmas,Cardinal Bernard Law said.   ``We are overwhelmed and thrilled and very grateful,'' saidPhyllis Martins, a member of the parish council of the Holy TrinityArmenian Apostolic Church of Greater Boston. ``It's veryheartwarming to know that people of this country and people of theworld are so responsive.''   President-elect George Bush and his wife, Barbara, also went tochurch in Washington, joining a choir from the 19th Street BaptistChurch that sang the ``Hallelujah Chorus'' from Handel's ``Messiah.''   Mrs. Bush told reporters her present from the president-elect``was just what I asked for'' _ a computerized dictionary. Shedidn't explain further, but it was believed she referred to ahand-held, calculator-size electronic device. Asked what she gaveher husband, Mrs. Bush replied: ``A big, fat kiss.''   At Grand Central Terminal in New York City, about 100 peoplejoined a candlelight ceremony for ``Mama,'' a homeless woman whodied there three years ago on Christmas Day. The homeless peoplethen marched to a hotel that prepared a Christmas dinner for about1,300 needy people.   For Tyrone Scott, 32, one of the marchers, it was his firstChristmas on the street. ``I think of my family all the time,'' hesaid. ``I called them this morning and told them to forgive me fornot being there and told them I'd try to get there next year.''   Twelve-year-old Celina Binkley moved into her new home onThanksgiving but remembered what it was like to be homeless. She wasamong 25 people at a Christmas Eve vigil in Denver outside a vacanthouse owned by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.``We're trying to support the homeless. It's like these people areour family,'' she said.   The spirit of good will prevailed in Los Angeles' 77th Streetpolice station where officers saved Christmas for a family that lostits presents to a holiday burglar.   Officers who took the report of the burglary were moved when afather tried to explain to his 2-year-old daughter and 4-year-oldson why their presents were gone. The officers passed the hat at thestation house and bought the girl a doll and plastic dish set andthe boy a fire truck.   Las Vegas reported its first Christmas Day snowfall in the 51years that weather service records have been kept. Police officerWilliam Walklin said the snow, which began at late afternoon andcontinued off and on during the evening, accumulated to about halfan inch in some areas but mostly melted when it hit the ground.   In San Francisco, where snow fell briefly overnight on the city'shighest elevations, the first snowfall in years, needy peoplebundled tight lined up outside churches and soup kitchens as earlyas 7 a.m. At St. Anthony's Dining Room, volunteers served a turkeydinner to 5,000 to 6,000 people.   ``There must have been about 2,000 people out or more in severecold weather who sought shelter and had no place to go,'' said theRev. Cecil Williams, pastor of Glide Memorial Methodist Church inthe Tenderloin District. ``There was no room at the inn.''   Snow also fell in Utah, Colorado, Nevada, Idaho, Montana andWyoming. Light snow fell in parts of New York and Michigan.   In the Albany, N.Y., suburb of Clifton Park, worshipers met inthe office of the Rev. Bede Ferrara to pray for the 14 Americanhostages held in Lebanon. ``Christmas time is good time to makepeople more conscious of people who are ill-treated and heldhostage,'' said Ferrara, a Franciscan priest.   In Atlanta, Jewish volunteers in a program by B'nai B'rith letworkers in several hospitals spend the holiday at home. ``Everybodyinvolved feels that it promotes brotherhood between Christians andJews,'' said Neil Freedland, who was working Sunday morning atNorthside Hospital. ``My wife and I were saying the other day thatwhen we take off on the High Holidays, there are always Christiansfilling in for us. ... This is our chance to help.''   The National Safety Council has estimated 350 to 450 were likelyto die on the nation's highways during the holiday weekend.   American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co. said holiday phone trafficcould reach a record 47 million long-distance calls by midnight onChristmas, up about 3 million from last year.</TEXT></DOC>
