But elsewhere, political partiesand other groups are scrambling to get a reluctant electorate out onElection Day.   ``I don't see nearly as much enthusiasm as you typically see in apresidential year,'' said Chris Verenes, executive director of theSouth Carolina Democratic Party, in a comment echoed across thecountry.   With only half of the country's eligible voters expected to turnout Tuesday, down from the 1984 figure of 53 percent, Republicansand Democrats alike know that getting people to vote will be theirNo. 1 challenge.   The White House, 33 Senate seats and all 435 seats in the Houseare at stake, and state and local races and issues abound.   Parties, unions and other special-interest groups are runningphone banks to reach swing voters as well as the faithful. As usual,workers will hand out leaflets, arrange for baby-sitting and escortpeople to the polls. But there are also some more unusual strategies.   In Arkansas, where the deer-hunting season opened Saturday,Republicans mounted a mail campaign encouraging deer hunters to getan absentee ballot if they won't be back from hunting in time forthe election. The National Rifle Association has saturated Arkansasand a dozen other states with ads claiming Michael Dukakis woulddisarm sportsmen, a charge the Democratic presidential candidatedenies.   Coalition '88, a group of gays and others who want two CaliforniaAIDS initiatives defeated, will have hundreds of volunteers onElection Day erecting ``human billboards'' at 70 major intersectionsin Los Angeles urging voters to get out and turn down the twopropositions.   Both parties are conducting massive drives for the state's 13.5million registered voters but worry about the dampening effect of aballot with nine state initiatives and possibly hundreds of localmeasures. Says state GOP chairman Bob Naylor: ``I'm very concernedthat people will be confronted with long lines at the polls, getearly results from the East Coast and absentee ballots and say,`What the heck. I won't vote.'''   Reasons for the low turnout projections vary, but many punditspoint to laws requiring registration days or weeks before theelection. Many voters also may simply be uninterested in the racesand find no compelling issue or inspiring candidate.   In Alabama, where there is no race for governor, U.S. Senate or amajor statehouse post, officials expect many voters to stay home.Oklahoma officials blame the tenor of the presidential race.   ``There is more negative campaigning than there was four yearsago, and I think it might affect the turnout,'' says Lance Ward,secretary of the Oklahoma election board.   But in Texas, home state of Democratic vice presidential nomineeLloyd Bentsen and Republican presidential nominee George Bush, thechief election officer is predicting a record turnout. Registrationis up 345,500 from the previous high in 1984, and there is a largerthan normal number of statewide races on the ballot to boot.   ``If we can't get them excited about this election, I don't knowwhat it's going to take,'' said Jack Rains, the secretary of state,who conducted the voter registration campaign.   In Utah, three tax-limitation initiatives are seen as the biggesthope of getting voters to the polls. And a Maryland gun-controlreferendum that's the subject of an expensive NRA campaign couldincrease voter turnout there by as much as 3 percent, officialssuggest.   Although the role of getting out the vote traditionally belongsto the parties, unions and other special-interest groups are doingtheir part.   In Arizona, opponents of a proposed amendment to the stateconstitution to make English Arizona's official language areconducting a major get-out-the-vote campaign, focused primarily onHispanic neighborhoods.   ``We will make 175,000 calls to Spanish-speaking voters anddistribute about 300,000 pieces of literature,'' said Rick DeGraw, apolitical consultant coordinating the effort. ``There are 27different organizations, some of them very small, working on thisstatewide.''   The AFL-CIO will have 500,000 volunteers out on Election Day, amajority of them in states with the most union members which alsohappen to be states with big electoral votes. The union has acomputer information bank that lets volunteers know how to reach 13million members.   In New Mexico, the AFL-CIO is dispatching buses to meet Carlsbadpotash miners getting off work and take them directly to the polls.In West Virginia, the United Mine Workers union is conducting itsown telephone campaign and will have volunteers at key precincts.   But even union officials say they are not sure they can get theirmembers to turn out in heavy numbers. Chris Scott, the AFL-CIOpresident in North Carolina, predicted a significant dropoff fromthe 1984 election and summed up the reason for some frustratedvoters:   ``I don't believe there's a candidate running for office in thisstate who's given people a positive reason to go out of their way tovote.''</TEXT></DOC>
