MillerStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 07/07/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> RCITENDER OFFERS, MERGERS, ACQUISITIONS (TNM)CHEMICALS, PLASTICS (CHM) </IN><TEXT>   The transpacific takeover battle between Dainippon Ink andamp; Chemicals Inc. and Reichhold Chemicals Inc. heated up, as Dainippon indicated it might sweeten its $473 million hostile bid and Reichhold said it is stepping up efforts to find other buyers.    The struggle is a rare example of a hostile takeover offer being waged by a Japanese bidder. Tokyo-based Dainippon unveiled its unsolicited $52.50-a-share bid for the White Plains, N.Y.-based chemical company last month. Last week, Reichhold dismissed the offer as inadequate and said it would consider other alternatives, including rival bids and restructuring moves.    In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Dainippon said it told Reichhold's board it would &quot;reconsider all aspects&quot; of its offer if it could meet with Reichhold management and review &quot;additional information about the company.&quot;    Dainippon conveyed its message in a letter dated June 29 from its president, Shigekuni Kawamura.    Dainippon's willingness to consider raising its bid wasn't a surprise. Since it first disclosed its offer, Reichhold's stock has soared well above $52.50.    Reichhold shares closed yesterday at $64, unchanged, in composite New York Stock Exchange trading.    Reichhold said yesterday that it has begun distributing packets of public information about the company to &quot;a number of potential acquirers,&quot; and has had requests from some of them for additional confidential information. One Wall Street takeover professional said Reichhold sent out between 50 and 150 packets.    Companies don't ordinarily issue press releases to discuss their search for bidders, and some on Wall Street saw Reichhold's announcement as a sign that it isn't having an easy time lining up another buyer. &quot;If you're doing OK and you've got buyers, you don't talk about it -- you just go and do it,&quot; one trader said.    One Wall Street source close to the battle said the most likely bidders for Reichhold would be companies already in the market for chemical resins, one of Reichhold's chief businesses. In general, the recent trend in the rapidly consolidating chemical industry has been combinations that expand a buyer's existing markets -- letting it find new economies in research and development -- rather than plunging it into new markets.    Among the major manufacturers in the resin market are Hercules Inc., Dow Chemical Co., Du Pont Co., and several West German giants, including Hoechst AG, BASF AG and Bayer AG. </TEXT></DOC>
