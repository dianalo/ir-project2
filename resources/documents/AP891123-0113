In an opening speech at a two-day meeting of the SocialistInternational council, Brandt described the changes sweeping theSoviet bloc as the ``growing-together of Europe'' and called for anall-European environmental agency as part of this process.   He welcomed the European Community's ``awareness'' of the needfor more productive economic cooperation between East and West.   The delegates also heard a call Thursday for a change in U.S.policy toward El Salvador.   ``The U.S. government must be requested to take on a moreconstructive attitude to a political and not a military solution,''said Hector Oqueli of the National Revolutionary Movement, aSalvadoran opposition party.   ``We are alarmed that the United States does not wantperestroika in satellite countries in Central America,'' saidOqueli, referring to the reform fostered by Soviet PresidentMikhail Gorbachev.   He asked the right-wing Salvadoran government to begin new peacenegotiations with the leftist rebel movement to end fighting thathas killed more than 1,000 people in the largest guerrillaoffensive of the 10-year-old civil war.   Brandt, president of Socialist International and the 1971 NobelPeace laureate, told the twice-yearly council meeting he had ``oneserious reservation'' about growing East-West cooperation.   ``Many in the Third World express the fear that what is going on... may mean a lessening of interest shown in the developmentprocess of the South,'' he said.   He spoke of the risk that Western money to help boost theflagging economies of reforming East bloc countries might mean adiversion of funds away from the Third World.   A closed sesion of the council meeting is expected to discussmembership bids from East European Social Democratic parties whichhave traditionally operated in exile.   The Social Democratic Party of Hungary, illegal until recently,has applied for full membership of the international body, as hasHungary's governing Socialist party.   The East German Social Democratic party, set up last month, hasasked for observer status with the organization, Brandt said.   Under Socialist International rules, only those partiesoperating in a multiparty system can be full members.   Nine East European political groups _ including the SocialDemocratic parties of the Soviet republics of Latvia, Lithuania andEstonia; the Hungarian and Czechoslovak Social Democratic partiesand the Polish Socialist party _ currently have consultative statuswith the organization.   Socialist International groups 89 socialist, social democrat andlabor parties worldwide. Delegates from about 60 countries areattending the council meeting.   They observed a minute's silence for victims of the Salvadorconflict and of Wednesday's bomb attack in Beirut that killedLebanon's new president, Rene Mouawad, and 23 other people.</TEXT></DOC>
