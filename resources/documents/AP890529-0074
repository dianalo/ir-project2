The prosecutors closed the eight-month inquiry by bringingmisdemeanor charges against four aides to senior politicians.Another 13 businessmen, bureaucrats and legislators have beencharged with bribery in the scandal.   ``The prosecutors have done everything that they should have,''said Justice Minister Masami Takatsuji.   Much of the ruling party elite has been implicated in thescandal that sent public approval ratings of the government toall-time lows. A close aide to Takeshita committed suicide April26, the day after the prime minister said he would resign.   But only two lawmakers face prosecution in the scandal and theannouncement of the investigation's end drew immediate charges thatothers who might be involved in the scandal had gotten away.   ``This will not satisfy the citizens of Japan,'' TsuruoYamaguchi, secretary-general of the opposition Japan SocialistParty, said.   Yamaguchi called for further questioning in parliament of formerPrime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone, who Monday resigned from thegoverning Liberal Democratic Party. Last week, Nakasone testifiedbefore a parliamentary committee about his links to Recruit Co.,and acknowledged receiving $320,000 from the publishing giant.   But Nakasone insisted he was innocent of any wrongdoing andrefused demands from opposition parties to resign from parliamentto take responsibility for the scandal, which occurred during his1982-87 term as prime minister.   Takeshita, who said he would step down after he acknowledgedreceiving $1 million from Recruit, urged party elders to acceptForeign Minister Sousuke Uno as his successor. Takeshita hintedthat he and his Cabinet will resign Thursday.   The resignations will be followed by a party convention to electa new party president and on Friday, parliament is expected toelect a new prime minister. Because the Liberal Democrats hold alarge majority in both houses, the party choice will automaticallybe voted prime minister.   Uno, 66, who was first elected to the House of Representativesin 1960, has been minister of international trade and industry andhead of the Defense Agency. He is not linked to the Recruit scandaland has experience in foreign affairs.   But some party members have said Uno lacks the experience inparty affairs that is indispensable to carry out needed reforms andsalvage the party's plunging popularity.   Recruit is accused of trying to influence the government byhanding out millions of dollars in political donations and sellingunderpriced, unlisted stock shares to business and politicalleaders in 1986. The stock quickly rose in price when placed on themarket, and those who received the unlisted shares reaped tens ofthousands of dollars in profits.   Charged Monday were Tsuneo Hattori, an aide to former FinanceMinister Kiichi Miyazawa; Fumio Shimizu, a aide to LiberalDemocratic Party secretary- General Shintaro Abe; and KikuoKatayama and Masayoshi Sakamaki, aides to former AgricultureMinister Mutsuki Kato.   The four allegedly failed to report donations from Recruit. Iffound guilty of the misdemeanor charges, they face fines of up to$1,400.</TEXT></DOC>
