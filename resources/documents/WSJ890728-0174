Trends spotted in February's 1988 full-year results are expected to show up even more clearly in 1989's half-year earnings. Domestic competition is intensifying, costs are still rising, interest margins are being squeezed further, and high U.K. interest rates have contributed to a slowdown in personal lending.    But even more important, analysts are expecting a big increase in provisions against problem debt from poorer countries, which will be a main factor dulling profit growth. The increases primarily will reflect higher provisions against interest and principal from Argentina.    &quot;Underlying profitability will be flat to modestly up because of tougher conditions in the U.K. market,&quot; says Terry Smith, an analyst at James Capel. He adds, however, that the figures are difficult to predict because &quot;no one knows what the banks will do about LDC {less developed country} provisions.&quot;    Lloyds Bank PLC kicks off the earnings season today. National Westminster Bank PLC follows next Tuesday; Barclays Bank PLC's results are due Wednesday; and Midland Bank PLC closes the Big Four results Thursday.    Lloyds' first-half pretax profit is expected to range between #444 million ($736.6 million) and #555 million, according to a survey of nine U.K. bank analysts. The range compares with pretax profit of #452 million in the first half of 1988. All pretax profit estimates take loan provisions into account.    The Lloyds results will reflect, for the first time, the bank's link with Abbey Life Group PLC late last year. Lloyds took a controlling 57.6% stake in the U.K. insurer, and in return, Abbey Life took over five of Lloyds' personal financial services businesses.    Among the others, Natwest is expected to post pretax profit between #700 million and #770 million, compared with #702 million the year before. Barclays' pretax profit is forecast to rise to #693 million to #768 million from #642 million the year before. Midland's pretax profit is expected to land between #300 million and #360 million, compared with #313 million the first half of 1988.    Argentina's continuing arrears on interest payments to commercial banks, which totaled $3 billion at the end of June, will lead banks to raise their provisions against interest. The arrears are also expected to boost the South American country's score on the Bank of England's matrix, which determines the level of provisions banks should set aside against principal.    Michael Lever, analyst at Smith New Court, estimates Lloyds' first-half provisions will be #112 million, compared with #48 million in the first half of 1988; Natwest, #44 million, compared with #6 million; Barclays, #70 million, compared with #18 million; and Midland, #110 million, compared with #90 million.    Mr. Lever's estimates assume Lloyds, Midland and Natwest will boost provisions against Argentinian principal to slightly more than 50% of exposure. Barclays is expected to boost its principal provisions to around 56% of exposure.    Mr. Lever and other analysts say it is possible the banks may wait until the end of the year to make the bulk of this year's provision increases.    Rod Barrett, an analyst at Security Pacific-Hoare Govett Ltd. and one of the most bearish toward provisions, predicts that in addition to an increase in normal provisions this year, the four will take exceptional charges on provisions by the end of the year. He predicts total 1989 problem-country debt provisions of #625 million for Lloyds, #245 million for Natwest; #320 million for Barclays and #735 million for Midland.    Mr. Barrett says his forecasts also reflect continuing arrears by Venezuela, higher provisions against Mexico, and uncertainty about Brazil, which has a large interest payment due in September. </TEXT></DOC>
