Nevertheless, U.S. officials said that they have expressed concern to the Japanese government about the issue, and that they have asked officials in Tokyo to look into it. And an aide to Sen. Jesse Helms (R., N.C.) said the lawmaker probably will introduce legislation in the Senate this week to impose sanctions against Japan Steel Works Ltd., a Japanese company that he alleged has supplied the Libyans machine tools and steel used to make chemical weaponry.    The draft legislation resembles a law passed earlier this year that punished Toshiba Corp. after one of its units was found to have sold machine tools to the Soviet Union that allegedly were used to make quieter submarines. That law barred a Toshiba subsidiary from exporting to the U.S. for three years and barred the parent company from doing business with the U.S. government for the same period.    &quot;Something is going to get introduced,&quot; said William Triplett, the Helms aide. &quot;Bear in mind you're talking state of Israel security here.&quot; He wouldn't describe the evidence that he said links the Japanese company with the Libyan chemical-warfare plant.    But a senior U.S. intelligence official said, &quot;I think a lot of people are running out ahead of the facts, trying to make this out to be another Toshiba case. I haven't seen anything that supports that conclusion. I can't say for certain that the Japanese weren't involved somehow, but I can't say they were, either.&quot;    A senior Defense Department official added, &quot;We're still looking at this. But so far we haven't got a case against the Japanese.&quot;    State Department officials said that a Japanese-built plant was in the same complex as the chemical-weapons facility, but that there was no information as of the weekend that materials had been transferred from it to the weapons factory. One of the major problems industrial nations have in coping with the proliferation of chemical weapons is that much of the technology that is used in making them also is used in harmless commercial processes such as the manufacture of pesticides and other agricultural chemicals.    In Japan, Kazuo Shimo, a Japan Steel Works spokesman, said the company shipped &quot;general purpose&quot; machine tools -- &quot;the kind you see anywhere&quot; -- to Libya in 1986. &quot;We shipped them for desalination equipment,&quot; Mr. Shimo said. &quot;We are perplexed at the news that they were used for another purpose.&quot;    He added: &quot;What can you do if you ship cider bottles to somebody and the guy uses the bottles to make molotov cocktails?&quot;    The Japanese government, remembering how rapidly last year's Toshiba incident spun out of control, moved rapidly to investigate reports about the Libyan chemical-weapons plant. &quot;We're still getting into it in detail, but so far we haven't found anything that indicates that the equipment violates weapons-exports principles or COCOM principles,&quot; said Jun Kamura, chief of the Middle East and Africa section of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry. COCOM, the Coordinating Committee on Export Controls, oversees controls on Western exports to communist countries.    &quot;We are still trying to confirm the news at this point, but there has been no evidence found that a Japanese company was directly involved in building a chemical-weapons plant itself,&quot; government spokesman Keizo Obuchi told reporters Friday.    Libya, meanwhile, has denied having the means to make chemical weapons.    In January 1986, the U.S. decided to ban certain U.S. exports to Libya, and Japan pledged simultaneously to do nothing to undermine the U.S. sanctions. It isn't clear whether the products Japan Steel Works shipped would have been covered by the U.S. sanctions. In any event, a MITI official noted that the contract for the equipment Japan Steel Works shipped was signed in 1985, before the U.S. sanctions were imposed, even though the shipment was in 1986.    Nihon Keizai Shimbun, a Japanese economic newspaper, reported that MITI officials were studying the possibility of clamping down on exports to Libya. The paper suggested there could be tighter controls on exports of &quot;dual-use&quot; goods and technology, or items that might have a military application even though they weren't specifically designed for military use. However, MITI's Mr. Kamura said he hadn't any knowledge of such a study.    One of the reasons the Libya case may be difficult to decipher is that similar equipment is used in both water-treatment plants and in the manufacture of exotic chemical weapons such as nerve gas.    For instance, the West German government currently is investigating W.E.T. G.m.b.H. of Hamburg, for shipping machinery and materials to Iraq that the U.S. believes became part of that country's poison-gas manufacturing capability.    The West German company shipped heavy-duty pumps, which chemical-weapons experts say are required in the process of making poison gas. But it insists that it was told the equipment was for a water-treatment plant. </TEXT></DOC>
