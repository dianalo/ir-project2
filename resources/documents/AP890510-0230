His pockmarkedcheeks, his shouted speeches, his belligerent manner all mark thestrong man of Panama as the obvious bad guy.   Furthermore, by the measures known to American politicalleaders, many of his own countrymen hate his guts. He also ispredictable: everybody said he would steal Sunday's Panamanianelections and the evidence is that he did so.   With traits like that he ought to be an ideal adversary.   But he also has been a survivor. ``Our policy remains thatNoriega must go,'' White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwatersaid Tuesday.   But the policy prior to that one involved a secret partnershipwith the Panamanian general against Nicaragua's Marxist-rungovernment.   That may be one of the reasons that he is a survivor. The UnitedStates has been trying to bring him down since 1987, withnegotiations, political opposition, threats, economic sanctions andcriminal charges, all of them withstood.   As head of the Panamanian Defense Forces, Noriega's power issolidly rooted in the military. Unfortunately for 1989policymakers, before beginning the effort to get rid of him, theU.S. government tried to use him.   The Reagan administration's Nicaragua fixation led tocollaboration with Noriega. The government's statement of facts atthe Oliver North trial told of an offer from the Panamanian boss inlate August 1986:   ``Noriega's representative proposed that, in exchange for apromise from the U.S. government to help clean up Noriega's imageand a commitment to lift the U.S. government ban on military salesto the Panamanian defense forces, Noriega would assassinate theSandinista leadrship for the U.S. government.''   North said that would be illegal. Noriega's man replied that thePanamanian could help in other ways, as when he had helped blow upa Sandinista arsenal in 1985.   According to the court papers, Vice Adm. John M. Poindexter,then the White House national security adviser, said that ifNoriega ``had assets inside Nicaragua, he could be helpful. TheU.S. government could not be involved in assassination, butPanamanian assistance with sabotage would be another story.''   In September 1986, North said Noriega wanted to meet him inLondon. Poindexter and Secretary of State George Shultz bothapproved that meeting. North returned to report that Noriega``would try to take immediate actions against the Sandinistas. ...''   That cozy relationship lends an ironic flavor to warnings inCongress that if Noriega got away with stealing an election, theSandinistas would have scant incentive to deliver on their promiseof free elections in Nicaragua early next year.   The era of U.S. collaboration with Noriega withstood initialaccusations that he was involved in drug trafficking. However, theReagan administration was trying to get rid of him before federalgrand juries in Florida returned drug-dealing indictments againsthim in early 1988.   Sen. John F. Kerry, D-Mass., calls Panama an example of what thedrug trade does to democracy. ``What is clear from the Panamanianexperience is that drug enforcement took a back seat to perceivedforeign policy concerns,'' he said last week.   Bush and a unanimous 100 senators declared in advance of theSunday voting that the United States would not tolerate a riggedelection and would respond accordingly. They also declared inadvance that Noriega's candidate could not win anything but arigged election.   The question now is what will work. Two years of graduallyescalating sanctions have battered the Panamanian economy withoutdislodging Noriega. The White House says no option, including theuse of military force, now is foreclosed.   The preferred option, of course, would be for the Panamanians toget rid of him themselves, rising up to insist on the leadershipthey are said to have chosen with their burned ballots.   Bush is urging Noriega to step aside because of the verdict ofhis countrymen. Should it require a heavier push from the outside,the United States needs to have it come from other Latin Americancapitals, not only from Washington.   Noriega long ago mastered the political art of rallyingsupporters and even some skeptics by claiming Yankee interferencein Panama. Even Nicaragua's Daniel Ortega turned up in Panama Cityin June 1987, to express support for Noriega against U.S. pressureto get him out.   That was less than a year after Noriega was said to have sentNorth the secret offer to assassinate the Sandinista leadership.</TEXT><TEXT>   EDITOR'S NOTE: Walter R.
