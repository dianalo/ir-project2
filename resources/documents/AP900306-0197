Nopickup</NOTE><DATELINE>OTTAWA (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A jury on Tuesday convicted Lebanese-born CharlesYacoub on two charges arising from his hijacking of a NewYork-bound bus to Parliament Hill last April and holding police atbay for eight hours before surrendering.   All 10 hostages on the bus eventually were released unharmed.   After more than 17 hours of deliberations, the jury convictedYacoub, 33, of forcible confinement, which carries a maximumsentence of 10 years in prison, and use of a weapon to commit anoffense, which carries a minimum sentence of one year in prison anda maximum of 10 years.   He was acquitted of charges of hostage-taking, which could havebrought a sentence of life in prison; intimidation of Parliamentand aggravated assault.   Yacoub, who sat without emotion in court while the jury renderedthe verdict, was held in custody to await sentencing.   In his closing arguments in the Supreme Court of Ontario Monday,defense lawyer Michael Kastner contended that while Yacoub wasresponsible for the incident, he had no criminal intent because ofhis mental state.   Psychiatrists described Yacoub as suffering from hypomania, areaction to depression in which people are driven by uncontrollablethoughts to do irrational things.   Justice Jean-Charles Sirois reminded jurors that some passengerstestified they were terrified during the incident.   ``I suggest to you that acts of violence were committed and thatall passengers were traumatized by their confinement,'' Sirois said.   Yacoub, who came to Canada from Lebanon in 1976 and lived inRepentigny, Quebec, near Montreal, used a .45-caliber pistol topull off the hijacking.   Kastner said that while he would have preferred a completeacquittal, the verdict was a victory because Yacoub was acquittedof the most serious charges. The lawyer indicated he will appealthe verdict and will also request bail.   ``He's not a terrorist, '' Kastner said outside the courtroom.``He's a jeweler from Montreal and was in a state of irresistibleimpulse when he committed this.''   The court was told Yacoub hijacked the Greyhound bus to bringattention to the fighting in war-torn Lebanon, his homeland.   He commandeered a bus bound for New York City from Montreal atabout noon on April 7 and forced the driver to take it to Ottawa,where it wound up on the front lawn of Parliament Hill. Initiallynine passengers and the driver were held as hostages.   Yacoub was demanding withdrawal of Syrian troops from Lebanon,the court was told.   Crown attorney Julianne Parfett said Yacoub was a terrorist andshould have been convicted of all charges against him.</TEXT></DOC>
