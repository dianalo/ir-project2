The issue has become embroiled in partisan politics as opponents have charged that rate reduction would be unfair and would benefit only a small segment of taxpayers. As a Democrat on the Ways and Means Committee, I believe a capital-gains differential benefits all Americans. The real issues in the debate have nothing to do with privilege or partisanship. The real issues are economic, and they are important: growth in America's productivity, strengthening our ability to compete for expanding world markets, and the creation of new jobs and opportunities for our workers.    For more than a generation Democrats and Republicans have understood that it makes good economic sense to provide incentives for those who place capital at risk as part of the effort to create a growing, dynamic, competitive American economy. In his 1963 message to Congress calling for a monumental tax-reduction bill, President Kennedy asked for a maximum tax on capital gains of 19.5% on individuals and 22% on corporations. In words that ring true today, President Kennedy pointed out that the existing higher tax on capital gains was &quot;both inequitable and a barrier to economic growth.&quot;    Over the years capital-gains initiatives in Congress have benefited from strong bipartisan support. For example, in 1978 when the exclusion of capital gains from taxable income was raised from 50% to 60%, the initiative was not viewed as partisan. In fact it was led in the Senate by Democrats Russell Long and Alan Cranston as well as many Republicans.    Reduced taxation of capital gains has a proven record of success in helping to build a stronger American economy. Lower capital rates help encourage entrepreneurs to commit their resources to the newer, risky ventures that may fail, but when successful can produce the jobs and exports of the future. They also will provide a powerful incentive for savings and investment at precisely the time our economy most needs it. Countries that save less invest less, and gradually lose their ability to compete. Net U.S. savings averaged only 5.3% of gross domestic product over 1973 to 1986 compared with 10.3% in West Germany and 18.6% in Japan.    The capital cost of investment in new equipment is an important factor in any country's ability to compete, and restoration of a capital-gains tax rate can help bring that cost down in the U.S. Capital costs in this country are twice as high as in Japan and substantially higher than those in most other industrial nations.    Our foreign competitors long have recognized the important link among low capital-gains taxation, economic growth and international competitiveness. Most either do not tax capital gains at all or tax them only lightly. In our own country, the potential positive impact of reduced capital-gains taxation can be enormous; one recent study suggests that a permanent reduction of the capital-gains tax rate to 15% would lower the capital cost of investing in new equipment by 14%.    For 25 years Republicans and Democrats, in Congress and in the White House, generally have supported a capital-gains tax rate and the U.S. economy has benefited as a result. Recently, however, it has been suggested that a capital-gains rate is &quot;unfair&quot; because a disproportionate share of the benefit would go to taxpayers earning more than $200,000 a year. In fact, there are many more taxpayers with moderate incomes who realize capital gains than there are in the higher-income brackets. Three-fourths of all tax returns with capital gains were reported by taxpayers with wage and salary incomes of less than $50,000, and nearly half of all capital-gains dollars go to people with incomes under $50,000.    In addition, it should be noted that our capital-gains tax-cut proposal is highly progressive. Most of the revenues gained from our proposed cut will come from upper-income taxpayers, but most of the proceeds will be used for programs that benefit those with lower incomes: expansion of the earned income credit to assist child care, the low-income housing credit, employer-provided education assistance, targeted jobs tax credit, and health insurance for the self-employed.    Partisan politics really has no place in the debate over an economic issue as important as reducing the capital-gains tax rate. The capital-gains proposal supported by a majority in the Ways and Means Committee is not a Republican idea or a Democratic idea. It is an idea that makes sense for America.    Rep. Michael A.
