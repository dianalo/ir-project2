The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 19.97 points to close at 2280.09, and the broader market averages more than kept pace. Both the Standard andamp; Poor's 500-stock index, which moved up 2.56 to 290.86, and the New York Stock Exchange composite index, which advanced 1.32 to 165.57, finished at record levels. Big Board volume rose to 174.8 million shares from Monday's 165.4 million. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by about 5 to 3.    International Business Machines &quot;led the market up, and that's good leadership,&quot; said Martin Krouner, manager of listed trading at Jeffries andamp; Co. IBM ended the day up 4 at 142 7/8 on volume of more than 1.8 million shares. Added Jerry Hinkle, co-manager of equity trading at Sanford C. Bernstein andamp; Co., &quot;It's the herding instinct -- when people see something as blue chip as IBM rising, they tag along.&quot;    Several companies involved in takeovers, including Chrysler, American Motors, Harper andamp; Row and Supermarkets General, were also actively traded yesterday. The prominence of takeover stocks in the past two days reminded some analysts of the market late last year. Part of the attraction of the takeover targets now, said Michael Metz, market strategist at Oppenheimer andamp; Co., is that there are very few obvious bargains in the big-name stocks. &quot;And as the market rises, speculative confidence rises,&quot; he said. &quot;So everyone's looking for the next takeover.&quot;    Mr. Metz warned that markets driven by takeovers haven't always been healthy. In fact, &quot;The end of the market move last time came when there was nothing else to play but takeovers,&quot; he said. &quot;That signaled that the market was pretty fully exploited.&quot;    Yet he noted that this year's dizzying climb so far hasn't been dominated by takeover plays, but rather by liquidity. That comes partly from the growth in the money supply and partly from what Mr. Metz calls the &quot;reliquification&quot; of investors -- the conversion of stock into cash because of takeovers and buybacks late last year. The result of so much liquidity, Mr. Metz said, is that &quot;valuations aren't terribly relevant now.&quot; And with the bond market almost paralyzed by conflicting reports on the economy's health, even more money will be moving out of bonds and into equities.    Yesterday, for example, Chrysler's treasurer, Fred Zuckerman, said the company's pension fund is considering moving about $1 billion of investments from the bond market into stocks. Right now, Mr. Zuckerman told the Dow Jones News Service, nearly 70% of the $3.5 billion pension fund is invested in bonds. He said he hoped to reduce that to 35%.    In addition to a continuing flow of cash into equities, there are other signs that the market has more room to rise, some analysts say. Peter Hackstedde, editor of the Bullish Consensus newsletter, said a recent poll of 120 newsletter advisers at major brokerage firms shows that only 60% of them are bullish. That indicator shows there's &quot;still a lot left on the high side,&quot; he said. Mr. Hackstedde also said he believes people are traders at market lows and investors at market highs, &quot;and right now, people are trading.&quot;    Yesterday's rally extended across several industry groups, embracing oil, paper, retail, chemical and technology issues.    The advance in IBM was partly attributed to analysts at two brokerage firms, who reportedly issued positive reports about the company yesterday. A few other blue-chip stocks also moved ahead yesterday, including Du Pont, which gained 2 7/8 to 108; International Paper, which climbed 2 to 99 3/8; and Exxon, which rose 1 1/4 to 82 1/4.    American Express, which fell 3 5/8 Monday, rebounded 2 1/8 yesterday to 79. The company announced that it would offer a new credit card permitting extended payment service at an interest rate tied to the prime rate. Also, a Drexel Burnham Lambert analyst reportedly put the company on the firm's priority buying list.    Harper andamp; Row, in which trading was halted Monday for news of a $34-a-share takeover offer from publisher Theodore Cross, reopened yesterday and shot up 9 1/4 to 34 1/4. According the Dow Jones News Service, the company's chairman said the board will meet soon to decide how to respond to the offer.    American Motors was the most active stock on the Big Board yesterday, ending the session unchanged at 4 1/4 on volume of more than 15.3 million shares. Chrysler, which has proposed acquiring American Motors, gained 7/8 to 54 3/4.    Other takeover stocks dominating the most active list included Supermarkets General, which fell 5/8 to 41 1/8 on volume of about four million shares. It is the target of $41.75-a-share offer by Dart Group.    Lucky Stores, which until recently had been fighting a proposed takeover by Asher B. Edelman, rose 1 1/4 to 30 1/4 with more than 1.5 million shares changing hands. The Class A stock of Resorts International, which has received a takeover bid from Donald Trump, rose 4 3/8 to 61 1/8.    Reebok International advanced 4 1/4 to 41 3/4 after it announced that it would acquire Avia, a Portland, Ore.,-based maker of athletic and casual footware for $180 million. Avia had been planning a public offering.    Kaufman andamp; Broad Home rose 2 to 17 1/4. The company said it announced late last week that net orders for new homes in California had increased more than 25% in the first quarter ended Feb. 28.    GenCorp advanced 1 1/4 to 84 after it announced that it would sell its RKO Pictures unit to the newly formed RKO Pictures Holding Co.    In the over-the-counter market, the Nasdaq OTC composite rose 2.60 to 429.39 as volume expanded to 141.3 million shares from 118.9 million Monday. There were 1,271 issues advancing and 936 declining.    Among widely followed OTC computer issues, Apple Computer jumped 2 1/8 to 66 3/4, and Lotus Development gained 1 to 22 1/2, but Seagate Technology was unchanged at 2 3/8.    Other gainers in the OTC market included Genentech, which rose 1 7/8 to 58 5/8, MCI, which advanced 1/4 to 6 3/8, and Nike, which moved up 5/8 to 16 1/2. Apparel maker Liz Claiborne, however, slipped 1/4 to 58 3/4. </TEXT></DOC>
