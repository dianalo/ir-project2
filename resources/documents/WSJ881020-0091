To truly narrow budget deficits, most analysts agree, the nation must raise taxes and curb the exploding cost of such programs as Medicare and Social Security.    When it comes to taxes, both Republican presidential nominee George Bush and Democratic nominee Michael Dukakis avoid any real discussion; Mr. Bush flatly declares he won't raise taxes, and Mr. Dukakis says he would only as a last resort.    And when it comes to entitlements, nobody wants to discuss them in this campaign.    One presidential candidate, Democrat Bruce Babbitt, dared to suggest reducing Social Security's cost by taxing more benefits paid to affluent senior citizens -- but he long ago disappeared from the race. Democrat Robert Strauss, head of a bipartisan panel studying the deficit, once mentioned curbing Social Security and Medicare benefits -- and was promptly disowned by his own party.    And in their final presidential debate, Mr. Dukakis and Mr. Bush competed to assure voters that they won't, in Mr. Bush's words, &quot;go in there and suggest changes in Social Security.&quot;    In fact, the next president almost certainly will have to take steps to rein in politically popular entitlement programs, which is Washington jargon for government programs, as varied as farm-price supports and Medicaid, that automatically pay benefits to anyone meeting certain qualifications. But because neither Mr. Bush nor Mr. Dukakis will discuss problems facing the two biggest entitlement programs -- Medicare and Social Security -- important changes affecting millions of people are likely to be made without a national debate or consensus.    &quot;The day of reckoning will be even more difficult if candidates are elected without a mandate or a program,&quot; says Mr. Babbitt, the former Arizona governor. &quot;It's as if all parties have taken a vow of silence, a collective vow of silence.&quot;    In analyzing the escalating cost of Medicare, the health program for the elderly, and Social Security, which pays a variety of benefits to 37 million Americans, statistics speak for themselves. While overall federal spending will rise 24% in the next five years without policy changes, Social Security spending will grow 29% and Medicare spending will soar 62%, the Congressional Budget Office estimates.    In President Reagan's first year in office, Medicare and Social Security accounted for 26% of all federal spending. In his last year in office, they will consume 29%. And on Inauguration Day in 1993, they will take 33%.    In the short run, most budget analysts agree, the government will have to at least consider curbing entitlement programs to meet its targets for cutting the budget deficit. &quot;When you look for ways to cut $35 billion a year out of the deficit each year for the next four years . . . it's almost impossible not to have to take a very hard look at those areas,&quot; says Stuart Eizenstat, director of domestic affairs in the Carter White House, who is leading American Agenda, a bipartisan group studying issues that will face the next president.    And in the long run, the nation must come to grips with the fact that the Social Security and Medicare programs are increasingly threatened by the aging of the U.S. population. By the year 2005, for example, the number of Social Security beneficiaries will have climbed about 22%, while the number of workers will have grown only 14%.    Peter Peterson, an investment banker who was Commerce secretary in the Nixon administration, warns that the nation is &quot;quietly expecting&quot; today's children to pay Social Security and Medicare taxes two or three times the current level to finance those programs early in the next century.    This demographic explosion will wipe out surpluses that have built up in the Social Security fund. Even now, those surpluses are more bookkeeping myth than reality. The government borrows unneeded Social Security payroll-tax revenues to finance other government programs, meaning that if less is paid to Social Security beneficiaries, more is left over to build bombers, pave roads and provide health care for the poor.    Yet neither Mr. Bush nor Mr. Dukakis talks of slowing the growth in spending on Social Security and Medicare. In fact, both supported a catastrophic-illness-insurance bill that expanded Medicare benefits. That bill -- which has become law -- included provisions for higher premium payments by Medicare recipients that sponsors insist will fund the increased benefits, though others are skeptical that the measure can pay for itself over the long haul.    Both candidates support allowing Medicare to pay for more health care in the home. And both favor expanding Medicaid, the health-insurance program for the poor; Mr. Dukakis would broaden it to cover more low-income pregnant women, and Mr. Bush would offer expanded coverage of children.    Generally, candidates don't like to discuss the price the U.S. pays to keep entitlement programs growing. But some economic analysts assert that expensive entitlements force the nation to skimp on benefits for the young. &quot;The American concept of entitlement is inherently prejudicial against the young,&quot; says Mr. Peterson. &quot;Our federal budget currently allocates 11 times more benefit dollars per capita to Americans over age 65 than it does to children under age 18.&quot;    Social Security pays billions to elderly Americans who could live comfortably without the benefits. Households with incomes above $50,000 will get $16.4 billion in Social Security benefits this year, $4 billion more than the government spends on food stamps.    Of course, groups representing the elderly argue strenuously that retirees deserve Social Security benefits regardless of their wealth. They note that the elderly were required to pay Social Security taxes over their working years as part of a solemn &quot;compact&quot; in which the government assured that benefits would be paid.    Taken together, entitlements, defense and interest on federal debt consume about 80% of the federal budget this year. Both Mr. Bush and Mr. Dukakis say they'll keep defense spending roughly at current levels, and neither can guarantee lower interest rates to reduce the government's interest bill. Neither talks of raising taxes to curb the federal deficit.    That leaves discretionary domestic programs -- which already have been squeezed hard over the Reagan years -- and entitlement programs as areas to find budget savings.    Medicare is particularly worrisome to some analysts, because of rapidly rising medical costs. &quot;Unless you can get control over medical costs, and get the increase down closer to the general inflation rate, you're not going to balance the budget by 1993,&quot; says Rep. Willis Gradison of Ohio, senior Republican on the health subcommittee of the Ways and Means Committee.    Steps could be taken to curb the costs of Medicare and Social Security without drastically altering the programs. And because the programs are so large, even small steps could produce big savings.    A modest increase in Medicare premiums, for instance, could cut billions. Medicare beneficiaries now pay premiums equal to 25% of the cost of the non-hospital-insurance part of Medicare, or $24.80 a month. Increasing the premiums to 30% would cut costs by $18.5 billion over five years, the Congressional Budget Office estimates. Alternately, it says, Medicare costs could be reduced by as much as $26.8 billion over five years by imposing a more-rigid government fee schedule on doctors and capping their Medicare income.    And significant savings could be found in Social Security by curbing the program's inflation-indexed benefit increases. Eliminating cost-of-living increases for one year would save $7.65 billion in one year and about $50 billion over five years. Limiting cost-of-living increases to two-thirds of the increase in the consumer price index for five years in a row would save $3.4 billion the first year and about $52 billion in five years.    Similarly, requiring Social Security beneficiaries to pay taxes on more of their benefits would raise big money. Taxing 85% -- rather than the current 50% -- of Social Security benefits for single recipients with more than $25,000 income and couples with more than $32,000 income would raise an extra $900 million the first year and $16 billion over five years.    But the fate of Mr. Babbitt, the presidential candidate who failed after raising such issues, hasn't inspired frank discussion among other politicians. &quot;I'm hardly Exhibit A in favor of raising these issues,&quot; Mr. Babbitt now acknowledges from his Arizona law office.    ---  Budget Forecasts If Next President Doesn't Change Policies  (In billions of dollars)                                                    Percent                                                    Increase  Fiscal Year     1989   1990   1991   1992   1993  1989-1993  Defense          300    310    322    335    348    16.0%  Entitlements     474    509    547    585    627    32.3%  Interest         163    178    188    192    198    21.5%  All other        190    204    208    217    223    17.4%  TOTAL          1,127  1,200  1,285  1,329  1,397    24.0%   Source: Congressional Budget Office</TEXT></DOC>
