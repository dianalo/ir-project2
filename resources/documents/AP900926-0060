He also said that other countries in the North Atlantic TreatyOrganization are considering a U.S. request to send ground troopsto join American, British, French and Turkish soldiers facing Iraqiforces in the Persian Gulf region.   He did not name the countries considering the request. OtherNATO countries are West Germany, Belgium, Italy, Greece, Denmark,Norway, Canada, Iceland, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Portugal andSpain.   Secretary of State James A. Baker III has said soldiers andairplanes from other nations would be welcome, even if the numberswere only symbolic, in the effort to force Iraq to withdraw fromKuwait.   Taft said all NATO countries have contributed military vesselsto the international armada enforcing an embargo on trade withIraq, except Iceland and Luxembourg, ``which don't have any.''   He said West Germany sent ships to the Mediterranean.   ``We're happy with the positive responses. ... We would like tosee the European allies do more,'' Taft said.   ``We would not be happy if there's nothing more,'' he said.``But we haven't given up.''   International cooperation on the Persian Gulf crisis isimportant because, Taft said, ``We're setting up the new (post-ColdWar) order of things, and the world needs to make it very clearthat invading a country and taking it over won't be accepted.''   Taft said the ``haphazard'' reaction of European Communitymembers to the gulf crisis had shown that ``political cooperationwill have to be effected before it (the EC) can expand to militaryaffairs.''   Taft said the United States supports the ``development ofEuropean defense capability'' but foresaw no complete withdrawal ofU.S. military forces from Europe despite the fall of Communistgovernments in Eastern Europe and improved relations with theSoviets.   He said no credible politician in the United States had proposeda smaller American presence in Europe than 80,000.   ``The United States is not considering, and no seriouspoliticians in the United States are suggesting, withdrawal of allU.S. forces in Europe,'' Taft said. He added that no Europeancountry, ``not even the Soviet Union, wants to see the UnitedStates disengaged from Europe.   ``It is the link the (NATO) alliance provides from the continentwith one superpower to another superpower. It's a balancing force,a force of stability,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
