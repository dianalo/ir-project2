With the Soviet Union, for example, the United States demandsthat human rights stand as a centerpiece of the superpowerrelationship.   Yet with China, Bush is moving to resume business with itsaging, hardline leaders even though they remain doggedlyunrepentant about the June massacre of pro-democracy demonstratorsand continue to suppress their citizens.   On Tuesday, Bush approved the export of three communicationssatellites expected to be launched by China, and he moved to end aban that kept the U.S. Export-Import Bank from aiding companiesdoing business with China.   Winston Lord, the U.S. ambassador to China until last April,says the United States would not have reversed course so swiftly ifthe killings had occurred in Eastern Europe.   Breaking with the administration because of its secretdiplomatic missions to Beijing, Lord said the U.S. overtures were asign of ``cultural, if not racial, bias.''   Bush has been an outspoken champion of democratic reforms thatare toppling hardline communist regimes from power in EasternEurope.   Along those lines, the White House on Tuesday denounced the``systematic denial of human rights'' in Romania and called on itsgovernment to cease the ``brutal repression'' that some witnessessay has left hundreds dead.   It is a message that could be aimed just as easily at China.However, Bush has muted his criticism of Beijing and he onlyreluctantly accepted sanctions imposed by Congress against China.   An old China hand, Bush has taken the position he knows betterthan his critics. It's hard to judge exactly what Bush is doingsince he refuses to talk about it publicly.   ``You see,'' Bush explained to reporters, ``I still believe thatsometimes to effect change, you talk in confidence to people.''   He insists his secret dealings do not amount to condoning therepression in China. ``That is not a good rap and it is not true,''Bush said.   As for the secrecy of Bush's actions, White House presssecretary Marlin Fitzwater says the president's conduct of foreignrelations ``will, from time to time, involve him in making trips,making contacts, talking to people and keeping it secret.''   The administration's actions have sharpened tensions between theWhite House and Congress on foreign policy and are sure to be anissue of contention when lawmakers return to Washington.   There probably will be congressional hearings on U.S. policytoward China.   The flash point of dispute is the two secret missions to Chinaby presidential emissaries Brent Scowcroft, Bush's nationalsecurity adviser, and Lawrence Eagleburger, his deputy secretary ofstate.   Reluctantly, the White House revealed that Scowcroft andEagleburger had traveled to Beijing barely a month after thecrackdown. The purpose, Fitzwater said, was to tell Chinese leadersface to face that the United States found their conductunacceptable.   The news provided fresh ammunition for opponents of Bush'spolicies.   ``To have sent two of our highest level officials to Beijingonly weeks after announcing a ban on such exchanges makes thepresident look like a wimp in Beijing and a hypocrite inWashington,'' said Rep. Stephen Solarz, D-N.Y.   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, demanded thatthe administration make a full disclosure of its contact with China.   Even before disclosure of the July trip, Democrats were up inarms about an announced visit by Scowcroft and Eagleburger to Chinain December.   Toasting Chinese leaders with words approved by Bush, Scowcroftsaid the United States wanted to bring ``new impetus and vigor'' tothe relationship.   In language soothing to the Chinese government, Scowcroft said,``In both our societies, there are voices of those who seek toredirect or frustrate our cooperation. We both must take boldmeasures to overcome these negative forces.''   Fitzwater, asked to identify the negative forces in the UnitedStates, said Tuesday, ``I don't know.'' He suggested that thequestion should be directed to Scowcroft.</TEXT><TEXT>   EDITORS NOTE: Terence Hunt has covered the presidency since 1981and is the AP's chief White House correspondent.</TEXT></DOC>
