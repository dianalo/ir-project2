The Federal Home Loan Bank Board has approved the acquisition of Union Warren Savings Bank, an FDIC-insured institution with $700 million in assets, by Home Owners Federal Savings andamp; Loan Association, a FSLIC-insured thrift with assets of $1.6 billion. Both institutions are based in Boston.    Earlier this year, more than a dozen thrifts, including the nation's 10th largest, applied to leave the FSLIC, which ended last year with a $6.3 billion deficit. The FDIC's premiums are 60% lower than the FSLIC's. The comprehensive banking bill signed into law in August puts a one-year ban on thrifts leaving the FSLIC.    The combination of Home Owners Federal and Union Warren creates the largest thrift in Massachusetts. </TEXT></DOC>
