Introduction </ITAG>The primary purpose of the net capital rule (Securities Exchange Act Rule15c3-1; 17 CFR 240.15c3-1) is to protect customers and creditors of registeredbroker-dealers from monetary losses and delays that can occur when a registeredbroker-dealer fails. The rule requires registered broker-dealers to maintainsufficient liquid assets to enable firms that fall below the minimum netcapital requirements to liquidate in an orderly fashion without the needfor a formal proceeding. In doing so, the rule enhances investor confidencein the financial integrity of securities firms. Similarly, the rule promotestransactions between broker-dealers, lenders, and creditors, on one hand,and the counterparty broker-dealers on the other, because those entitiesare more likely to consider a broker-dealer credit-worthy if it must complywith a liquidity-based capital adequacy standard. Presently, the net capitalrule generally requires a registered broker-dealer's net capital to exceedthe greater of $25,000 or 6\2/3\ percent of its aggregate indebtedness(``aggregate indebtedness method'' or ``basic method'') if the broker-dealerdoes not elect the alternative method.\1\<NOTE/> If it elects the alternative method under paragraph (f),the broker-dealer's net capital must exceed the greater of $100,000 or2 percent of its aggregate debit items as computed in accordance with theFormula for Determination of Reserve Requirement for Brokers and Dealerscontained in Securities Exchange Act Rule 15c3-3.\2\<NOTE/>  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ <T3>See </T3>Securities Exchange Act Rule 15c3-1(a); 17 CFR 240.15c3-1(a).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ <T3>See </T3>Securities Exchange Act Rule 15c3-3a; 17 CFR 240.15c3-3a. If the broker-dealer does not carry customer accounts and limits its businessto certain specified activities, it need maintain only $5,000, rather thanthe $25,000 which would  otherwise be required under the aggregate indebtednessmethod.\3\<NOTE/> If the broker-dealer makes markets in securities, it mustmaintain the greater of its requirement under the aggregate indebtednessmethod or $2,500 for each security priced over $5 in which it makes a marketplus $500 for each security priced at $5 or less in which it makes a market.\4\<NOTE/> Unless required to do so because of the level of its aggregateindebtedness, regardless of how many securities in which it makes a market,a market maker is not currently required to maintain net capital greaterthan $100,000 to support its market making activities.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ <T3>See </T3>Securities Exchange Act Rule 15c3-1(a)(2); 17 CFR 240.15c3-1(a)(2).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ <T3>See </T3>Securities Exchange Act Rule 15c3-1(a)(4); 17 CFR 240.15c3-1(a)(4). If the broker-dealer elects the alternative method, as opposed to the basicmethod as noted above, its minimum net capital will be $100,000 ratherthan $25,000, but it will generally incur smaller haircuts on the marketvalue of its equity securities positions than those broker-dealers thatelect the aggregate indebtedness method.\5\<NOTE/>  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ Securities Exchange Act Rule 15c3-1(c)(2)(vi)(J) setsforth the deduction for equity securities positions and other securitiespositions that are not otherwise specifically provided for in Rule 15c3-1.That deduction is ``30 percent of the market value of the greater of thelong or short positions and to the extent the market value of the lesserof the long or short positions exceeds 25 percent of the market value ofthe greater of the long or short positions, there shall be a percentagededuction on such excess equal to 15 percent of the market value of suchexcess.'' Securities Exchange Act Rule 15c3-1(f)(3)(ii) sets forth thededuction incurred by broker-dealers that elect the alternative methodfor securities that would otherwise incur a deduction under subparagraph(c)(2)(vi)(J). Subparagraph (f)(3)(ii) requires the electing broker-dealerto deduct 15 percent of the market value of long positions and 30 percentof the market value of short positions but only to the extent those shortpositions exceed 25 percent of the long positions.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Minimum Net Capital </ITAG>While the idea of a net capital standard dates back to at least 1934, federalrequirements as to a minimum amount of net capital were first introducedin 1965. In that year, principally in response to the Report of the Specia1Study of Securities Markets (``Special Study''),\6\<NOTE/> the Commission's net capital rule was amended to requirefirms to maintain certain minimum capital amounts.\7\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\ <T3>See </T3>Report of Special Study of Securities Markets of the Securitiesand Exchange Commission, 88th Cong., 1st Sess., H.R. No. 95, April 3, 1963.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\ <T3>See </T3>note 14, <T3>infra</T3>. The Special Study recommended minimum capital requirements as an essentialqualification for broker-dealers entering the securities business. It basedits recommendation on several factors: First, firms handling customer fundsand securities should have sufficient capital so that they are not dependentupon customer assets to make up the principal working capital of the firm.Second, firms should have adequate capital, resources, and equipment sothat the securities markets function smoothly and efficiently and marketparticipants have   the resulting confidence to carry out business responsibly.Finally, if the liability of a broker-dealer to its customers from violationsof state and federal law is to be a deterrent to improper conduct, a firmshould be required to maintain a reasonable financial stake in its business.The Commission is mindful of the argument that increased minimum capitalrequirements restrict free entry to the broker-dealer business. However,while capital barriers were not initially imposed after the enactment ofthe Securities Exchange Act, both Congress and the Commission later recognizedthe need to restrict under-capitalized firms from entry into the securitiesbusiness. In the 1971 Committee Staff Study for a Special Subcommitteeof the House Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce, Congress suggestedthat attention be directed to the need to increase the minimum net capitalrequirements of broker-dealers, ``particularly those just entering thesecurities industry.'' \8\<NOTE/> In 1971, the Commission issued its Study of Unsafe and UnsoundPractices (``Practices Study'') \9\<NOTE/> in response to the paperwork crisis of the late 1960's, inwhich many firms experienced debilitating back-office failures due to  the then heavy volume of securities transactions. In the Practices Study,the Commission specifically addressed the issue of ease of entry. AppendixF to the Practices Study contained a description of actions taken by theCommission against certain broker-dealers. In that Appendix, the Commissionnoted that the principals of many of those firms, which were able to remainin business for periods ranging from only eight months to three years andeight months, had little or no background in the securities industry. Theprevious activities of some included such unlikely fields as advertising,insurance, automobile financing, personnel relations, engineering, andselling soft drinks.\10\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\8\ Review of SEC Records of the Demise of Selected Broker-Dealers,Staff Study for the Special Subcommittee on Investigations of the Committeeon Interstate and Foreign Commerce, House of Representatives, 92nd Cong.,1st Sess., pg. 33 (July 1971). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\ Study of Unsafe and Unsound Practices of Brokers and Dealers,Report and Recommendations of the Securities and Exchange Commission, H.R.Doc.

The Commission was concerned then, as it is today, that undercapitalizednew entrants to the business would cause harm to customers and potentiallybe a financial drain on the insurance-type fund maintained by the SecuritiesInvestor Protection Corporation (``SIPC''). SIPC, through the Commission,may draw up to $1 billion on the U.S. Treasury.\11\<NOTE/> The Practices Study concluded that:  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\11\ Under the Securities Investor Protection Act of 1970(``SIPA''), SIPC maintains a fund consisting primarily of assessments receivedfrom its member broker-dealers. From that fund SIPC makes advances to customers,as defined in SIPA, of failed broker-dealers. In the event the SIPC fundshould prove inadequate, SIPC may, through the Commission, borrow up to$1 billion from the U.S. Government. <T3>See </T3> Securities Investor Protection Act of 1970, Sec. 4(h). <ITAG tagnum="20">[t]o permit unprepared, irresponsible parties to enter the broker-dealerbusiness without the restraining influence of adequate entry standardswould be tantamount to the subsidization of incompetent and irresponsibleindividuals by SIPC and the United States Treasury.\12\</ITAG><NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\12\ <T3>Id</T3>. In response, the Commission adopted the current $25,000 net capital minimumrequirement for broker-dealers transacting a general securities business.\13\<NOTE/> The absolute minimum capital requirements of $5,000, $25,000and $100,000 have remained since the Uniform Net Capital Rule was adoptedover fourteen years ago.\14\<NOTE/> Both the relative value of the dollar and the nature of thesecurities industry have changed markedly since that time. Indeed, thedollar is now worth less than 50 percent of its 1976 value, making theseminimum requirements less than half of what they were in absolute terms.\15\<NOTE/> The complexity of markets and the activities that broker-dealersare engaged in also have dramatically increased in the last decade. Proprietarytrading by both institutions and by the broker-dealers themselves has greatlyexpanded. The penny stock markets have become much more active.   <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\13\ Securities Exchange Act Release No. 9633, June 14, 1972,(37 FR 11970, June 16, 1972). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\14\ The absolute minimum of $25,000 under the basic methodwas adopted in 1972 (<T3>See </T3>footnote 12). The $100,000 absolute minimum under the alternativemethod was adopted in 1975 (Securities Exchange Act Release No. 11497 (June26, 1975), 40 FR 29795, (July 26, 1975)). The $5,000 minimum currentlyapplicable to most broker-dealers that do not hold customer funds and securitieswas adopted in 1965. At that time, the $5,000 minimum was applicable toall broker-dealers except those that limited their activities to transactionsin shares of registered investment companies and federally insured savingsand loan associations. (<T3>See </T3> Securities Exchange Act Release No. 7611, May 26, 1965, 30FR 7276, June 2, 1965.) <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\15\ The Consumer Price Index (CPI) in February 1976 was anadjusted 55.8 (based on a 1982-84 base year) and 121.6 in February 1989.This is an increase of 117.9 percent. <T3>See </T3>Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics, CPI. TheCommission requests comment on whether the minimum net capital requirementsshould be regularly adjusted to take into account the effect of inflation.In this connection, should capital levels in the future automatically beadjusted or indexed to the rate of inflation? Commentators favoring indexingof minimum capital requirements should also indicate what measure theybelieve should be used by the Commission to index capital requirementsand how often they believe adjustments based on the rate of inflation shouldbe made.Broker-dealers have also expanded the variety of their activities. Thelast fifteen years have seen firms engaging in not only a greater volumeof transactions but in transactions involving more complex products, suchas interest rate swaps, foreign currencies, mortgages, mortgage-backedsecurities, and over-the-counter (``OTC'') options. The holdings of customerfunds and securities also have increased greatly over the years; the Commissionestimates that this figure has risen perhaps as much as ten-fold sincethe early 1970s. Finally, while the Commission notes that on a statisticalbasis price volatility has been relatively low in the last year, duringthe period from October 1988 through April 1989 there were 73 separatedays in which the Standard and Poor's 500 Stock Index experienced intra-dayprice movements of more than two percent.  The business of buying and selling securities, moreover, is one in whichsuccess, both to the firms and to the investing public, is strongly dependentupon confidence, continuity, and commitment. The Commission is concernedover the potential effects of broker-dealer firm failures on their counterparties,clearing agencies, and the financial system in general. Given the increasinglylarge customer and proprietary positions maintained by even relativelysmall broker-dealers, the potential exists for a single firm failure totrigger substantial exposure to a number of broker-dealers and banks. Therisks of such a chain reaction underline the importance of minimum capitalrequirements set at levels which may substantially reduce the likelihoodof such failures. Thus, increasing the minimum capital requirements would ensure that thosewho do wish to establish a broker-dealer entity do so with that amountof capital necessary to maintain adequately a solvent venture. The increasedminimum capital requirement would encourage potential entrants to exhibita serious commitment to a business whose customer and capital nature demandssuch a commitment. Most importantly, as discussed earlier, raising minimumcapital requirements would protect the investing public and the SIPC fundby requiring a greater pool of liquid assets from which customer claimsmay be satisfied. The Commission's most serious concern is with the current amount of capitalrequired of clearing firms. As discussed more fully below, firms with capitalof only $25,000 can clear for a number of other securities firms and canhold customer funds and securities amounting to millions of dollars. Whensuch firms experience financial difficulty, there are significant costsimposed on customers and on regulators (which ultimately are borne by thesecurities industry or by taxpayers) even if the firms do not ultimatelyhave to be liquidated under SIPA. Customers can be frozen in their positionsfor weeks or months and administrative costs to monitor troubled firmsand/or to administer liquidations can be high. The Commission believesthat the potential costs to investors, to the SIPC fund, and to the self-regulatoryorganizations, in the event firms self-liquidate with a very limited cashcushion are inappropriately high when weighed against the potential coststo broker-dealers of increased minimum net capital requirements. Furthermore, the Commission's proposal to raise the minimum capital requirementsof broker-dealers has drawn preliminary support from some of the self-regulatoryorganizations responsible for monitoring the activities of those firmsand from one industry association. The National Association of SecuritiesDealers' (``NASD's'') Capital and Margin Committee and the NASD's AdvisoryCouncil have expressed their belief that adopting higher minimum capitalstandards is a matter of some urgency.\16\<NOTE/> Furthermore, both the Securities Industry Association (``SIA'')\17\<NOTE/> and the New York Stock Exchange (``NYSE'') \18\<NOTE/> had previously endorsed the reconsideration and the increasingof the minimum net capital requirements.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\16\ <T3>See </T3>Letter from John E. Pinto, Executive Vice President, Compliance,NASD, to Michael Macchiaroli, Assistant Director, Division of Market Regulation,SEC, dated May 31, 1989. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\17\ <T3>See </T3>Comment letter to John Wheeler, Secretary, SEC, from MichaelMinikes, Chairman, Capital Committee, SIA, dated July 26, 1985, concerningConcept Release, File No. S7-3-85, p. 8. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\18\ <T3>See </T3>Comment letter to John Wheeler, Secretary, SEC, dated July31, 1985, from James Buck, Secretary, NYSE, concerning Concept Release,File No. S7-3-85, pp. 3-4.  A. <T3>Clearing Firms_</T3>For purposes of Rule 15c3-1, a clearing firm isa broker-dealer that takes orders from customers, processes their tradesand maintains custody of customer funds and securities. Clearing firmsare frequently engaged in other lines of business such as securities lending,proprietary trading, and futures trading. A firm may also process tradesand maintain custody of funds and securities of investors who give theirorders to introducing firms. The clearing firm's duties, as outlined inthe clearing agreement, include the proper disposition of the customermonies and securities after trade date, the holding of customer securitiesand funds as appropriate, and the handling of the paperwork associatedwith carrying customer accounts. These services involve such high fixedcosts that, if they were incurred by   the typical introducing firm, itwould be prohibitively expensive for such a firm to enter the securitiesbusiness. Such costs include the computer costs necessary to generate variouscustomer statements and account records, as well as the personnel costsof maintaining back-office operations such as cashiering and margin departments.For its services, the clearing firm usually charges the introducing broker-dealera fee based on a percentage of the retail securities commission revenuereceived by the introducing firm. If a broker-dealer carrying customer funds and securities fails, thereis potential for significant harm to be suffered by its customers. Furthermore,the risks that clearing firms, particularly those with small amounts ofcapital, pose to customer accounts can be greatly exacerbated by the factthat there are no limits on the amount of customer funds and securitiesthat can be held.SIPC's experience with liquidations demonstrates this latter point. Inmany cases, the SIPC trustee has had to use SIPC advances \19\<NOTE/> at least in part to pay off customers' claims of securitiesand cash in amounts many times in excess of the firm's required net capital.For example, in one case, in which the firm's required net capital beforeit failed was only $119,000, the SIPC trustee paid out to customers fromSIPC advances over $6,000,000 and from the debtor's estate over $25,000,000in customer funds and securities. In another case, in which the firm'srequired net capital was less than $120,000, the SIPC trustee paid outto customers almost $14,000,000 in cash and securities; more than halfthis amount was paid out of SIPC advances.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\19\ Under Section 9 of SIPA, SIPC makes advances to customersof a broker-dealer that is the subject of a SIPC proceeding. SIPC makesthose advances from the SIPC fund. The SIPC fund had been established throughassessment of SIPC member broker-dealers. (<T3>See </T3>Section 4 of SIPA). These SIPC liquidations reflect common risk exposures of many operatingclearing firms. At the request of the Commission staff, the NASD randomlysampled NASD clearing firms having capital of less than $130,000. Of the84 firms in this sample, 21 were found to be holding more than $1 millionin securities. The Commission believes that SIPC liquidation experienceand the random sampling demonstrate that a significant percentage of broker-dealersthat clear and carry funds and securities and that do not maintain significantexcess net capital control substantial customer assets that are potentiallyat risk. In order to evaluate the risks entailed in maintaining those low minimumcapital requirements, the Commission also has evaluated instances of liquidationswhich did not require intervention by SIPC. While there were only eightSIPC liquidations in 1987 and 1988,\20\<NOTE/> there were more than twice as many self-liquidations underthe auspices of the NASD Washington headquarters staff. In 1987 and 1988,there were 18 such self-liquidations in which the NASD oversaw the distributionof over $250,000,000 in customer property involving relatively undercapitalizedfirms. These cases provide examples of potential exposure to the SIPC fund.Of the many cases of firm self-liquidation that the NASD has had to supervisebecause of lack of substantial net capital, two are particularly noteworthy.One firm held $70 million of customer securities, although it had only$61,000 of net capital. The other firm held $8 million of customer securitiesand only $42,000 of net capital. Fortunately, because the NASD was awareof the problems suffered by the above firms before they failed, the NASDwas able to have the firms move customer accounts to other clearing firmsand thereby avoid SIPC liquidations.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\20\ In this regard, the number of SIPC customer protectionproceedings commenced in 1987 and 1988 is the lowest for any two-year periodin SIPC's history. And the SIPC fund is at its highest level ever. <T3>See </T3>SIPC Annual Report 1988. P3. When the NASD monitors a firm self-liquidation, it commits from two to25 of its staff personnel to the process of supervising the firm. In additionto the NASD personnel, employees of the firm being liquidated are retainedin order to do the work associated with transferring the accounts. Thoseemployees, along with the costs associated with maintaining the premises,and transferring and shipping securities, must be paid from whatever capitalremains in the broker-dealer. Self-liquidations may take from three weeksto several months, depending on the condition of the records of the broker-dealerand whether the NASD is readily able to locate other broker-dealers willingto take the customer accounts. Self-liquidation costs to the self-regulatory authorities are difficultto measure since most of the incremental expenses other than employees'compensation time is mainly for per diem expenses of employees on travelstatus and for telecommunication expenses. On average, however, the NASDhas advised the Commission staff that even the smallest liquidation requirestwo to three NASD employees on premises for a minimum of two weeks. Thelargest recent liquidation required a staff of about 25 NASD employeesfor about 10 weeks on premises, with fewer people thereafter. The recordedaverage cost for the NASD including salaries is about $2,000 per week peremployee. Beyond administrative costs, customers are usually unable to access theiraccounts when their broker-dealer is placed in a SIPC liquidation or aself-liquidation. Although every attempt is made to transfer accounts toa solvent broker as rapidly as possible, that goal is not always achievable,either because of the type of accounts, the poor condition of the broker-dealer'srecords, or the lack of adequate margin in customer accounts. While requiring additional amounts of net capital to be maintained willnot prevent firms from failing or otherwise leaving the securities business,the additional capital provides a fund from which the expenses associatedwith the liquidation can be paid. If that fund is not adequate, eitherthe NASD or SIPC must fund the administration of the liquidation. If theremaining capital in the firm is low and the NASD supervises the liquidation,the NASD will not have the means to pay the employees of the broker-dealerto perform the clerical tasks associated with the distribution of propertyto customers. Accordingly, the NASD would have to use its own employeesto perform these tasks and would incur substantial additional expenses.If the amount of remaining capital is small and the amount of customerproperty to be distributed is very large, SIPC would likely have to administerthe liquidation. The initiation of a SIPC proceeding would result in increasedadministrative expenses. More importantly, customers are adversely impacted from a SIPC liquidationbecause their funds and securities remain frozen until their property canbe transferred to another broker-dealer or returned to them. Finally, tothe extent their claims exceed their pro rata share of customer property,customers must rely on SIPC advances. Section 4 of SIPA limits SIPC advancesto satisfy the claims of each customer up to a maximum of $500,000 forcash and securities, with a limit of $100,000 for cash claims. Failures of clearing firms also present risk to the system as a whole byputting a financial strain on clearing agencies. Clearing agencies or corporationsact as the central location for matching security transactions of members.This facilitates determination of minimum quantities of particular securitiesto be received or delivered. Generally, the clearing corporation nets eachbroker-dealer's settling purchases and sales in each security to arriveat a daily net settlement obligation for each broker-dealer. Broker-dealersthen settle those net obligations with the clearing corporation. The clearingcorporation guarantees the settlement obligations of each broker-dealer'scounter trading party. Losses to clearing firms from market disruptions such as the October marketbreak can have the serious effect of causing losses to the related clearingcorporations. While a single clearing firm failure probably would not putthe entire system at risk, a combination of such failures could conceivablybring down a clearing system. If a clearing agency itself were to fail,the risk of a precipitous disaster to other financial service entitieswould be enormous.Based on these observations, the Commission preliminarily has concludedthat broker-dealers who are responsible for customer funds and securitiesimpose substantial actual and potential risks on customers, other broker-dealersand the financial system and therefore should have a required minimum netcapital higher than other classes of broker-dealers covered under the Rule.The amount of capital these customer firms maintain demonstrates theirlevel of commitment to the business. Accordingly, the Commission believesthat the minimum level of net capital for this class of broker-dealersshould be raised to $250,000. Because of the increased assurance of stability which would be providedby the proposed minimum capital level, the Commission proposes that thehaircut associated with positions in firm commitment underwritings, orthe contractual commitment haircut, be relaxed for a portion of a firm'sincreased capital requirement.\21\<NOTE/> The proposed amendment would not require a broker-dealerwho meets the $250,000 minimum to apply the contractual commitment haircutcharge in certain circumstances in which that haircut would be $150,000or less.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\21\ A contractual commitment haircut is a percentage deductionfrom net worth which must be taken by a broker-dealer that has open contractualcommitments. Currently, the net capital rule requires that the appropriatehaircut be applied to these positions reduced by any unrealized profitsthat the broker-dealer may have in these commitments. <T3>See </T3>Rule 15c3-1(c)(2)(viii) (17 CFR 240.15c3-1(c)(2)(viii)). In addition, because the Commission believes that capital requirementsshould be based largely on the risks created by firms in their securitiesactivities, the Commission believes that it is appropriate to distinguishbetween those firms that hold funds and securities for other persons andthose that do not hold funds or securities yet carry customer accounts.Because firms that do not hold funds and securities impose a lower levelof risk, the Commission believes that lower minimum requirements for suchfirms are justified. The Commission therefore proposes for comment a minimumcapital requirement of   $100,000 for firms that are exempt from Rule 15c3-3by virtue of paragraph (k)(2)(i). Firms that fall within the paragraph(k)(2)(i) exemption must effectuate all customer securities transactionsthrough a Special Bank Account for the Exclusive Benefit of Customers.Such broker-dealers cannot carry margin accounts, must promptly forwardall customer funds and deliver all securities received in connection withtheir activities as broker-dealers and cannot otherwise hold for, or owemoney or securities to, customers. B. <T3>Introducing Firms</T3>_An introducing broker-dealer is one that hasa contractual arrangement with another firm, the carrying or clearing firm,in which the carrying firm agrees to perform certain services for the introducingfirm. Generally, the introducing firm submits its customer accounts andcustomer orders to the carrying firm, which executes the orders and carriesthe accounts. The carrying firm's duties include the proper dispositionof the customer monies and securities after trade date, the holding ofcustomer securities and funds and the recordkeeping associated with carryingcustomer accounts. The Commission believes that introducing firms create risks for investors,clearing firms, and other firms with which they deal, and thus that thereis ample justification for an increase in their minimum capital requirements.Even though the failure of an introducing firm does not normally resultin a SIPC liquidation, it may result in substantial costs to the firmsthat carry the customer accounts for the introducing firm. In addition,customers may be unable to trade for some period of time until they canfind another introducing or clearing firm to which they can transfer theiraccounts. Finally, because many introducing firms do in fact handle customerfunds and securities for short periods of time, there is SIPC exposurefrom their activities. As a result, the Commission believes that increasedminimums for introducing firms are risk-justified. As the Market Break Report pointed out,\22\<NOTE/> introducing broker-dealers pose risks to the investing publicas well as to other broker-dealers. First, those broker-dealers do, infact, receive customer funds and securities, although the funds and securitiesmust be promptly forwarded to firms that carry the customer accounts. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\22\ <T3>See </T3>The October 1987 Market Break, a Report by the Division ofMarket Regulation of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, February1988 (``The Market Break Report''). Approximately 55 firms that introducedcustomer transactions on a fully disclosed basis to a clearing broker-dealerceased operations because of violations of the net capital rule causedby losses directly related to the October 1987 market break. Most of thelosses resulted from defaults by customers that failed to make paymentto the clearing broker-dealers for which the introducing broker-dealerswere contractually liable. At least eleven of the fifty-five introducingfirms made markets in OTC securities. <ITAG tagnum="28">The losses sustained by these firms were a result of unsecured customerdebits for which they were contractually liable and declines in the marketvalue of proprietary inventory. Three of the 55 firms also suffered substantialtrading losses related to their options market making business. </ITAG><T3>See </T3>p. 5-9 of the Report. <ITAG tagnum="28">Approximately forty percent of the introducing firms that ceased operationsre-opened within a week after they closed. A number of firms forced toclose because of unsecured customer debits were able to increase theirnet capital and therefore re-open by entering into subordination agreementswith their clearing brokers. The remaining firms were able to acquire additionalcapital sufficient to bring them into compliance with the Commission'srules. </ITAG>There is an obvious risk for the customer if the introducing firm failswhile in possession of customer funds and securities. There have been severalrecent cases where an introducing firm failed and, because the firm wasdeclared to have ``customers'' under SIPA, there was exposure and payoutfor the SIPC fund. Such ``customers'' are created, as mentioned above,when the introducing firm does not promptly forward the customer fundsto the clearing firm and the introducing firm fails. Second, if an introducing firm fails, or even ceases doing business temporarily,its customers are often stranded. The carrying firms associated with introducingfirms often will not accept orders from customers because the carryingfirm may regard the customers as those of the introducing firm. As a result,customers may be unable to liquidate securities positions or open new positionswith the proceeds of sales until their accounts are transferred to otherbroker-dealers.Finally, introducing broker-dealers can cause significant losses to carryingfirms, exposing the customers and creditors of those firms to loss. Duringperiods of market decline, customer accounts may become unsecured due toa precipitous drop in the value of the securities in margin accounts orbecause of changes in value of customer short options positions. If theaccount has been introduced, the introducing firm generally is obligatedto the carrying firm for deficits in the introduced customer accounts.If the introducing broker-dealer does not have adequate resources to reimbursethe carrying firm, the carrying firm may suffer significant losses.\23\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\23\ During the October 1987 market break, Haas SecuritiesCorporation, a market maker in 11 securities and a member of the NYSE,ceased operations. Haas introduced customer transactions on a fully disclosedbasis to L.F. Rothschild. As a result of unsecured customer accounts introducedby Haas, Rothschild incurred a reduction in net capital of between $15and $20 million. <T3>See </T3>Market Break Report pg. 5-11. Because of the loss exposure from introducing firms, many clearing firmswill not clear for introducing firms without substantial capital or substantialdeposits, which serve as collateral for unsecured customer debits.\24\<NOTE/> At the request of the Commission staff, the NASD conductedan informal survey of the firms that clear introduced accounts. The NASDsurvey indicates that the practices varied greatly among the clearing firmsthat were contacted. For example, the following arrangements for introducingfirms were included in the surveyed clearing arrangements: A requirementof $150,000 minimum net capital and a deposit if the firm has trading accounts;minimum deposit of $5,000, but could go as high as $300,000 for marketmakers; clearing deposits between $50,000 and $100,000 determined by creditcommittee; a requirement of 110 percent of the introducing firms' highestinventory position.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\24\ Under the net capital rule, a bona fide clearing depositmade by an introducing firm with a clearing firm is treated as asset readilyconvertible into cash and therefore part of the net capital of the introducingfirm. <T3>See </T3>Rule 15c3-1(c)(2)(iv)(E). The Commission believes that, while the NASD survey is informal and includesonly a small number of clearing firms, it demonstrates that many firmshave imposed capital and deposit requirements to protect themselves fromthe risk of failure of undercapitalized introducing firms. At the sametime, because the standards are not uniform, weaknesses in the system tendto develop. Assuming that clearing firms that are more risk conscious requiretheir introducing firms to maintain the greatest amount of capital, clearingfirms that are not as sensitive to risk will tend to have a higher concentrationof introducing firms that are poorly capitalized and engaging in riskieractivities. Accordingly, the Commission proposes to raise the minimum capital requirementfor introducing firms based upon the activities that they engage in andthe commensurate risks created. Thus, three classes of introducing firmswould be created under the proposed amendments. Some introducing broker-dealersnow routinely receive customer funds and securities for transmittal tothe clearing firm. Those firms are responsible for the funds and securitiesuntil received by the clearing firm. Under the proposal, this class ofintroducing firm would be required to maintain net capital of at least$100,000. Introducing firms that occasionally receive customers' fundsand securities would be required to maintain at least $50,000. This coversinstances of customers inappropriately sending funds or securities to theintroducing firm. While the Commission preliminarily believes that the net capital minimumsshould be increased substantially to reflect the risks entailed in theoperation of many introducing broker-dealers, it is also cognizant of theimportance of providing relatively free access to the securities industrywhen firms do not pose risks to their customers or the SIPC fund. Accordingly,introducing firms that never receive customer funds or securities and donot handle margin accounts would be allowed to remain in the $5,000 minimumnet capital category. In order to avoid classification as a $50,000 broker-dealer,introducing broker-dealers who wish to remain in the $5,000 category wouldneed to take the utmost care in advising their customers not to send fundsor securities to the introducing firm. In addition to the requirement imposedon such introducing firms under the basic method, they would be requiredto maintain additional net capital of \1/4\ percent of the customer debitbalances that they introduce. Finally, the Commission proposes to increase the ability of introducingfirms to participate in firm commitment underwritings. Under the currentrule, broker-dealers that compute under the minimum required of introducingbroker-dealers are prohibited from engaging in firm commitment underwritings.In light of the proposed higher minimum levels, introducing broker-dealerswould be allowed to participate in firm commitment underwritings as longas they are only the selling dealer and not the statutory underwriter.\25\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\25\ In a firm commitment underwriting, the underwriters agreeto buy the entire issue of a security from the issuing corporation at aspecified price. The current net capital rule allows introducing broker-dealersto participate in underwritings only on a ``best efforts'' or ``all ornothing'' basis. The Commission proposes that as long as the firm is onlya selling dealer, i.e., purchases the issue from the statutory underwriterand not the issuer in order to sell, it can participate in firm commitmentunderwritings. The Commission requests comment on its proposed classes of introducingfirms and the minimum levels associated with each class. Furthermore, theCommission requests comment regarding practices of firms that clear introducedaccounts for setting financial responsibility standards for introducingfirms. Specifically, the Commission requests comment on the effectivenessof standard-setting by the industry and whether higher minimum capitalrequirements are necessary. C. <T3>Over-the-Counter Market Makers_</T3>In its Market Break Report, theDivision of Market Regulation expressed its belief that the minimum amountof capital necessary for a broker-dealer to qualify as a market maker shouldbe reviewed.\26\<NOTE/> The Commission is also concerned about the limited amountof net capital the rule presently requires of a market maker. The marketmaker who maintains only the minimum amount of net capital required frequentlyis unable to assume even the smallest number of positions in the stocksin which it reportedly makes a market. Moreover, to the extent its netcapital falls below the minimum amount required, such a firm is compelledto withdraw as market maker in at least some of its market making securities,an action which could impair the market in those securities. This has beena particular problem in the penny stock market, in which the failure ofmarket making firms has resulted in the virtual elimination of a publicmarket for many of the securities for which they made public markets. Asound marketplace requires that OTC market makers have the wherewithalto take positions in those securities in which they make markets.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\6\ <T3>See </T3>Market Break Report at p. 5-15.The NASD has recommended that the capital requirements of certain marketmakers be increased. The NASD has recently approved rule amendments toits Small Order Execution System (``SOES'') which require not only mandatoryparticipation in the SOES for all market makers in certain securities,but also different maximum SOES order-size limits based upon the marketcharacteristics of the securities.\27\<NOTE/> Under mandatory SOES participation, market makers will berequired to accept small orders received through the SOES system. Accordingly,the NASD Quality of Markets Committee has recommended that the Commissionrequire an increase in capital to at least the amount required to supportmandatory SOES positions.\28\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\27\ <T3>See</T3> File No. SR-NASD-88-1, Securities Exchange Act Release No.25791 (June 9, 1988).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\28\ <T3>See </T3>Report of Special Committee of the Regulatory Review TaskForce on the Quality of Markets, NASD publication, 1988. In response to the concerns noted above, the Commission proposes for commenttwo separate amendments. The first would increase the present ceiling of$100,000 net capital required of market makers to $1,000,000. The secondwould raise the requirement for each security priced at $5.00 or less pershare to $l,000 from $500. Thus, for example, a firm making markets in100 securities priced in excess of $5 and 50 securities priced below $5would have a minimum net capital requirement of $300,000. D. <T3>Broker-Dealers That Transact a Business in Mutual Fund Shares</T3>_Theproposed amendments would also alter the capital requirements for broker-dealersthat limit their activities to transactions in shares of registered investmentcompanies. Currently, the minimum net capital requirement for this typeof broker-dealer is the greater of $2,500 or 6\2/3\ percent of their aggregateindebtedness. This minimum requirement seems inappropriately low, however,considering that these firms receive money from customers and may alsotransact business directly with issuers. The Commission thus proposes forcomment that the basic minimum requirement for mutual fund broker-dealersbe raised to $25,000. However, for those mutual fund firms which do nothandle any customer funds   or securities and are not direct wire orderfirms, the Commission proposes a $5,000 minimum net capital requirement.E. <T3>Broker-dealers Who Trade Solely for Their Own Accounts_</T3>Firms thattrade solely for their own accounts (``trading firms'') are currently requiredto maintain net capital of the greater of 6\2/3\ percent of their aggregateindebtedness or $25,000 under the basic method, or $100,000 under the alternativemethod. The Commission believes these firms should not be permitted tocontinue to compute under the alternative method. The theory underlying the alternative method of calculating net capitalis that, for large firms, customer debits will provide an approximate proxyof the amount of business and exposure of the firm. Because proprietaryfirms have no customer accounts, the alternative method does not limitleverage for those firms. This means that a firm with the $100,000 minimumcapital required under the alternative method could have very large aggregateindebtedness and therefore very substantial leverage in its business, therebyincreasing its assets substantially in relation to its net worth, withoutrestriction except for the haircuts on its positions. Yet, proprietary trading activities obviously are risky, and leverage exacerbatesthat risk. As pointed out in the October Market Break Report, several riskarbitrage firms lost an average of 41 percent of their combined net worthduring the market break.\29\<NOTE/> Moreover, such firms often have positions concentrated ina few stocks and may suffer substantial losses from arbitrage positionsin a hostile takeover battle. Furthermore, the trading firms' businessinvolves substantial risk to the extent that it consists of investing inlarge risk arbitrage or speculative positions with less diversificationthan that usually undertaken by larger firms. While these firms do notdeal directly with customers, they do expose other broker-dealers, clearingentities, and creditors to substantial risk.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\29\ <T3>See</T3> Market Break Report at p. 5-7. The Commission believes that failure of a proprietary firm with the relativelysmall cushion provided by the alternative method could impose financialrisk on those contra parties and, in turn, their customers. Accordingly,the Commission proposes for comment that trading firms no longer be permittedto elect the alternative method. The Commission further proposes for commentthat the minimum net capital requirement for those firms be raised to $100,000.As a consequence of these proposed amendments, most of those firms wouldbe required to increase their capital by the difference between their current$100,000 minimum and 6\2/3\ percent of their aggregate indebtedness. F. <T3>All Other Broker-Dealers_</T3>As noted above, the Commission has preliminarilydetermined to maintain a $5,000 category for introducing brokers and dealerswho do not handle   customer funds or securities. In addition, under thecurrent rule, broker-dealers that participate in underwritings on a ``bestefforts'' basis and who promptly forward all customer funds to the issueror a designated independent escrow agent, are required to maintain minimumcapital of only $5,000. This firm category should include primarily firmsthat sell direct participation programs (``DPP'') in real estate syndications.Because of the limited business conducted by DPP firms, the Commissionis making no specific proposal for change in the minimum capital requirements.However, the proposed amendments would provide that any firm that maintainsonly the $5,000 level of capital would be prohibited from receiving customerfunds or securities. If they do so, they would immediately be requiredto maintain the next higher level. The Commission believes that this newrequirement would help to protect investors from having their cash andsecurities exposed while being handled by a broker-dealer with very limitedcapital. The Commission requests comments as to whether it is appropriateto permit best efforts underwriting firms to remain in the $5,000 residualcategory. Finally, some firms do not take customer orders, hold customer funds orsecurities, or execute customer trades, yet register with the Commissionbecause of the nature of their activities. An example of such a broker-dealeris a firm that identifies and locates potential merger or acquisition opportunitieson behalf of a client, and thereby earns a percentage fee. For these miscellaneoustypes of broker-dealers, the Commission also proposes a $5,000 minimumnet capital requirement.For most firms that would be included in this category, this will not representan increase in the required minimum net capital.\3\\0\<NOTE/> Some mutual fund dealers that would fall into this categorywill go to a $5,000 requirement from a $2,500 requirement under the existingrule. Like the DPP firms, however, the Commission proposes that these firmsbe prohibited from having any contact with customer funds or securities.In addition, other firms, such as floor brokers, which may avail  themselvespresently of the $5,000 requirement, will continue to be able to complywith that requirement.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\30\ To qualify presently for a $5,000 minimum net capitalrequirement under paragraph (a)(2) of Rule 15c3-1, in addition to not carryingcustomer accounts, the broker-dealer must limit itself to certain specifiedactivities in paragraph (a)(2). The Division has issued no-action positionsthat make the $5,000 minimum requirement available to certain firms thatdo not handle customer funds or securities, but engage in activities notspecified in paragraph (a)(2). G. <T3>Phase-In Schedule</T3>_Because of the impact of the increased minimumcapital requirements on some broker-dealers, the Commission proposes thatthe minimums be staggered over a period of four years from the effectivedate. Each year after the effective date, the minimum requirements foraffected broker-dealers would increase by 25 percent of the increase. Thus,for example, if the increase was from $25,000 to $250,000, the minimumrequirement one year after the effective   date would be $81,250 (($225,000andmultiply;.25)+$25,000).The proposed timing of the increases is summarized below:<ITAG tagnum="16">i. </ITAG><T3>Firms That Hold Customer Funds or Securities (Aggregate IndebtednessMethod) </T3><ITAG tagnum="14">a.

By 12/31/93: $25,000</ITAG>The Commission specifically requests commentators to focus attention onthe phase-in provisions and to indicate whether the proposed timing andmethod of phase-in are appropriate. In particular, the Commission is concernedthat, given the significant level of risk present in the system, a four-yearphase-in may be too long to achieve the maximum degree of customer andsystemic protection contemplated by these proposals. On the other hand,given the size of some of the increases in minimums proposed, the Commissionis interested in permitting, to the extent practicable, a smooth transitionwith minimal disruption for both firms and customers. H. <T3>Request for Comment</T3>_The Commission requests comment on the minimumcapital requirements set forth in the proposed amendments to the rule.In this connection, the Commission recognizes that the determination ofthe appropriate levels of minimum net capital necessarily requires considerationof the benefits of higher standards, as well as the impact of those standardson broker-dealers. In arriving at the proposed new minimum net capitalrequirements, the Commission, on the basis of available data and its regulatoryexperience, has attempted to balance the cost of raising additional capital(and the effect on those that will not be able to raise it) against theabove described benefits of a prudent financial responsibility standard.The Commission, nevertheless, requests comment on alternative methods thatmight be used to establish minimum net capital requirements. More specifically,the Commission asks if a minimum absolute dollar amount requirement couldbe based on quantifiable measures of risk. As discussed, the Commission is concerned with the large dollar amountsof customer fully-paid securities in the possession of broker-dealers withminimum capital. Some broker-dealers have access to several million dollarsof fully-paid customer securities, but are required to maintain only $25,000in net capital. This financial commitment does not appear commensuratewith the resulting risk to SIPC or the investment community. The Commissionrequests comment as to whether this concern is best addressed by a largerminimum dollar requirement for broker-dealers that carry customer accountsor by requiring broker-dealers that carry customer accounts to regularlydetermine the dollar amount of customer fully-paid securities they havein their possession and take a charge against these amounts when computingtheir net capital requirement. The Commission also seeks comment regardingwhether some combination of the above would be appropriate. Finally, theCommission requests comment as to whether it would be appropriate to havea smaller minimum dollar requirement (for example $100,000) for carryingfirms that take a capital charge against customer fully-paid securitiesin their possession, and a larger minimum dollar requirement (for example$250,000) for firms that chose not to.The Commission also requests comment on the costs imposed by the proposedamendments. While a precise estimate of the costs of the proposals is difficult,a rough estimate can be made based on the relative cost of capital. Personswho enter the broker-dealer business generally do so through partnershipsor through corporations. In either case, the individual or individualswho establish the firm can deposit into the entity assets they have orcash they have borrowed. These assets are deemed to be capital of the broker-dealer.Indeed, as has happened before, a person may borrow $5,000 on a creditcard and deposit the money as capital into a broker-dealer corporationand thus be in compliance with the net capital rule requirements for a$5,000 broker-dealer. In addition, a broker-dealer may, under the net capitalrule, count as net capital monies borrowed from another person if subordinatedin conformity with the net capital rule requirements.\31\<NOTE/>  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\31\ <T3>See </T3>Appendix D to the net capital rule, Rule 15c3-1d.  Once in the broker-dealer corporation, the funds may be invested in highgrade commercial paper, bank certificates of deposit or short-term governmentsecurities, all of which, as money market instruments, receive little orno haircut. The Commission estimates the difference between the lendingrate and the rate the broker-dealer could earn on the above investmentsto be approximately three to four percent annually before taxes. Assuminga $45,000 borrowing for an introducing firm which only occasionally receivescustomer funds and securities (and thereby would qualify for the proposed$50,000 introducing level), the cost of the additional capital (assuminga net cost of 4%) would be only $1,800 per year. From recent financial filings with the NASD \32\<NOTE/> compiled as of March 31, 1989, it was determined that 173clearing firms would need, on average, an additional $123,000 to complywith   the new $250,000 minimum requirement. Using the above assumptionson the cost of capital (a four percent spread), in order to comply withthe new minimum net capital requirement, it would cost each of the 173clearing firms on average approximately $5,000 per year or a total of $850,000.Additionally, of the 763 market maker firms, 63 have required capital ofbetween $100,000 and $1,000,000 and thus may be affected by the new higherceiling on additional capital required of market makers.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\32\ Under Securities Exchange Act Rule 17a-5 (17 CFR 240.17a-5), registered broker-dealers are required to file reports containing certainfinancial and operational information with both their designated examiningauthority and the Commission. These reports are filed on the Uniform Financialand Operational Combined Uniform Single Report (commonly known as the FOCUSreport).  As to introducing firms, NASD data as of the same period does not distinguishbetween introducing firms that routinely handle funds and securities andthose that do not. Assuming that every introducing firm handles customerproperty on a routine basis, the data indicate that 1428 introducing firmswould need, on average, $65,702 each to comply with the new $100,000 minimumcapital requirement. The total cost of raising this capital based on a4 percent cost of capital assumption is $3.8 million or $2,600 per firm.Assuming every introducing firm only occasionally handles customer fundsand securities and thus would have a $50,000 minimum requirement, it wasdetermined that 1,063 firms would need to raise an average of $28,555.Making the same cost assumption as discussed above, the cost of raisingtheir capital requirements would be $1.2 million or $1,100 per firm peryear. The Commission acknowledges that broker-dealers may incur costs other thanthe estimated 4 percent referred to above in obtaining additional capital.For example, if the borrowing is done personally, the owner of the firmwill likely be required to encumber personal assets. However, even if theestimated cost of obtaining additional capital were 8 percent, the averageannual cost for a clearing firm would be only $10,000. At the 8 percentlevel, an introducing firm would incur annual costs of either $5,200 or$2,200 per year, depending on the method by which the firm elects to dobusiness. The Commission preliminarily does not believe that the costs describedabove will have the effect of barring entry or making unprofitable anygroup of entrepreneurs who have a serious commitment to developing a brokeragefirn. The Commission requests comment, however, on the specific costs tobroker-dealers of its proposal. In this connection, the Commission asksfor comment as to the amount of net capital in excess of the early warninglevels \33\<NOTE/> that firms would normally maintain as a business matter.Additionally, commentators are requested to provide information regardingtheir likely sources for obtaining additional capital, the cost of thosefunds, and the return on the investment they would likely obtain from theuse of those funds.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\33\ <T3>See </T3>17 CFR 240.17a-11.  The Commission also asks if particular firms will change their operationsso they can operate under one of the lower minimum net capital categoriespermitted under the proposals. Commentators are further encouraged to provideinformation   regarding their lines of business and related revenues andthe need for the Commission to determine if additional classes of firmsshould be created to accommodate the needs of smaller broker-dealers. The Commission also requests comment from those small broker-dealers thatelect to carry customer accounts rather than to take advantage of the lowercapital requirements that are currently in the rule for introducing firms.The Commission is particularly interested in receiving input from smallercarrying firms regarding the reasons they have elected to remain as carryingfirms and be subject to the higher minimum requirements and how their businesswould be affected if they were to switch to introducing their customersto another firm. The Commission is specifically interested in receivinginput from firms regarding the potential impact on revenues and expensesin the event these broker-dealers decided to conform to the limitationsimposed under the provisions of the lower capital requirements (such asnot handling in any way customer funds and securities). Finally, the Commission requests comment from those firms that may notbe able to raise additional funds. The Commission requests input on whetherthe alternatives proposed by the Commission with respect to maintaininglow levels of minimum net capital are flexible enough to permit those firmsto continue to remain in business_even if that means they will have toforego handling funds and securities_or whether those firms will have tocease doing business as registered broker-dealers. For those firms thatwould cease doing business because of the increase in minimums, the Commissionasks what factors would be important in making that decision.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Securities Haircuts </ITAG>A. <T3>Equity Securities_</T3>The current rule requires different levels ofdeductions as to equity securities and different computations of thosedeductions depending on the broker-dealer's election of either the basicor alternative methods.\34\<NOTE/> Although the nation's equity securities markets experiencedan extraordinary surge of volume and price volatility during October 1987,in most circumstances the deductions incurred for those securities appearadequate. However, the distinctions in the haircuts between the alternativeand basic methods, given the proposed raising of the minimum requirements,do not seem appropriate.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\34\ <T3>See </T3>note 4, <T3>supra. </T3>Haircuts generally are designed to provide a cushion of capital againstadverse fluctuations in the prices of securities. The net capital rulehaircut has varied over the years. Generally, equity haircuts were settledsome 25 years ago at 30 percent of the greater of the long or short position.The lesser position was deemed by the rule to be hedged by the greaterposition but only to the extent that it did not exceed 25 percent of thegreater position. The theory, of course, is since market movements areresponsible for a substantial percentage of price movements for individualstocks, diversified long positions (or diversified short positions) willto some degree move in the same direction. In 1975, the Commission adopted the present rule and a new, alternativemethod for determining haircuts. In order to facilitate market-making,the Commission determined to allow firms electing the alternative methodto take a 15 percent haircut on the long positions. The haircut on theshort position, to the extent it exceeded in value 25 percent of the longposition, was taken at 30 percent of the market value. Firms electing thealternative, however, were required to have a minimum net capital of $100,000,rather than the $25,000 minimum otherwise required. This additional cushionof capital was deemed necessary in the event the haircuts proved inadequate.Given the Commission's experience with the haircuts under the alternativemethod and because the Commission is revisiting its minimum net capitallevels generally, the Commission preliminarily believes that the haircutsfor equity positions under the aggregate indebtedness method should belowered. However, haircuts may be appropriately reduced only if the minimumlevels of net capital are raised because the value of a particular securitycould easily move more than the lower haircut. Moreover, generally, exceptfor tender offer situations, a long would seem to be no less volatile orrisky than a short position, and thus should not be subject to a differenthaircut. Under the proposed amendments, the calculation of haircuts for those underthe alternative method and those on the aggregate indebtedness method wouldbe standardized.\35\<NOTE/> The haircuts for both long and short positions would be 15percent of the market value. An additional 15 percent would be assessedon the market value of the lesser position to the extent it exceeded 25percent of the greater position. The l5 percent deduction for long positionswould be available to those firms which have more than $100,000 in netcapital. Under the proposed amendments, the alternative method for computingconcentration charges would be adopted.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\35\ Under the proposed amendments, the broker-dealer wouldnotify only its designated examining authority, and not the Commission(as is currently the case), of its election to operate under the alternativemethod. The Commission invites comment on particular methods for determining haircutson equity securities positions. The Commission further requests commenton whether the use of historical price volatility data, such as the Commissionhas used in the past for developing haircuts for debt securities, is anappropriate method for determining haircuts on equity securities. B. <T3>Zero Coupon and Stripped Securities_</T3>The Commission also proposesto amend its securities deductions to exclude instruments that includeonly principal or interest. Under the current rule, for example, any securitythat is ``* * * issued or guaranteed as to principal or interest by theUnited States or any agency thereof * * *'' incurs a haircut of zero tosix percent, depending upon the maturity of the security. These percentages,however, were drafted to reflect the price volatilities of securities thatinclude both principal and interest and thus do not contemplate the riskinherent in ``stripped'' securities. Under the proposal, these zero-couponsecurities (other than those issued by the Treasury) would be subject tothe 15 percent haircut proposed for equity securities. The Commission recognizes that, while stripped securities have differentprice volatilities for differing maturities than corresponding coupon bonds,there is a distinct benefit in creating a uniform haircut across all maturities.Preliminarily, the Commission believes that, given the relatively lowerlevel of activity in coupon instruments as compared to Treasury instrumentsthat contain principal and interest, a uniform haircut is more practicalbecause it minimizes the complexity of the rule. If the Commission doesnot adopt a uniform haircut for coupon instruments, it is likely that aseparate series of maturity categories will have to be created for thosesecurities. The Commission requests comment as to the appropriate haircutfor zero-coupon Treasury as well as other stripped instruments.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Aggregate Indebtedness </ITAG>The aggregate indebtedness test has been included in the net capital rulesince its adoption in 1942. Generally, the term aggregate indebtednessincludes all of the liabilities and/or obligations (contingent or otherwise)of the broker-dealer. By limiting the amount of indebtedness of registeredbroker-dealers to a percentage of net capital, the rule limits the leveragethat broker-dealers that elect the basic method are able to attain. Therule however, specifically excludes from aggregate indebtedness certainprescribed liabilities. In the two classes of liabilities described below,the Commission believes the 6\2/3\ percent aggregate indebtedness chargemay not be appropriate, particularly in light of the proposed increasesin the minimum requirements. A. <T3>Mutual Funds Payable Offset by Fails to Deliver_</T3>The present rulerequires a broker-dealer that owes money to a mutual fund in connectionwith a purchase of shares of that fund to include that amount in aggregateindebtedness even if offset by a receivable from another broker-dealerrelated to that transaction. This payable arises out of a purchase by thebroker-dealer directly from the fund of shares of the fund for anotherbroker-dealer (presumably for its customer). The first broker-dealer owesmoney to the fund secured by the investment company shares. The secondbroker-dealer owes money to the first broker-dealer. The debt on the firstbroker-dealer's books is offset by a receivable from the second broker-dealer,classified generally as a fail to deliver. That receivable is also securedby the mutual fund shares, since delivery of the shares will not occuruntil payment of the obligation by the second broker-dealer. Our experienceindicates that, as a general rule, most of these fails to deliver are completed.The Commission believes that, to the extent that this class of fails todeliver is offset by a liability to the fund, a capital cushion of 6\2/3\percent to cover the liability is unnecessary. Rather than the 6\2/3\ percentcharge that results under the current rule, the Commission proposes thatthis requirement be lowered to one percent of the liability amount whenan offset exists. B. <T3>Stock Loan and Stock Borrowed_</T3>A stock loan payable is a liabilityarising from the receipt of cash collateral from a person who borrows securitiesfrom the broker-dealer. It is considered aggregate indebtedness even ifthe securities that were loaned were borrowed from another broker-dealer.When one broker-dealer lends securities to another broker-dealer, the lendingbroker-dealer generally receives cash collateral in excess of the valueof the securities lent. That collateral is deemed to be a liability onthe books of the lending broker-dealer, since that broker-dealer owes moneyto the borrowing broker-dealer. Much of the stock lent by one broker-dealer to another broker-dealer hasbeen borrowed from yet a third broker-dealer or other person. That borrowing,if collateralized by cash, results in a receivable from the lending person.The borrowing broker-dealer has turned over cash to the lending entitywhich in turn was received from the second borrower of securities. In thatsituation, the firm has a stock loan payable versus a stock loan receivableanalogous to a government securities repurchase book. Generally, excludingfraud, these are not risky positions. The major risk in such positions(normally characterized as a finder's book) is the liquidity risk. If aperception arises that a broker-dealer is in financial distress, stockborrowers will return stock to the lending broker-dealer for cash whichcannot be as readily obtained from the persons to whom the failing broker-dealerhas given cash. This run on a broker-dealer would likely impair its abilityto function as a clearing agent. Given the matched nature of those related payables and receivables, theCommission does not believe that risk merits a charge of 6\2/3\ percenton the dollar amount of the liability. The Commission believes, however,that a lower cushion (one percent) against the liquidity risk of a largefinder's book is appropriate. The one percent number has previously beenused by the Commission in the net capital rule in order to curtail leverage.\36\<NOTE/> The Commission thus proposes that liabilities related toa corresponding securities borrowing incur only a 1 percent charge againstnet capital.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\36\ <T3>See </T3>Rule 15c3-1(f)(5)(iv).<ITAG tagnum="84">V. Technical Amendments </ITAG>Because of the proposed amendments to the minimum net capital requirementsand the equity securities haircuts, it became possible for the Commissionto merge paragraph (f) with paragraph (a) of the rule. As a result, theproposed rule amendments include several technical changes to the rule.For example, all references to paragraph (f) would be deleted. Other examplesinclude the proposed amendments to the concentration charges under paragraph(c)(2)(vi)(M) and the contractual commitment charge under paragraph (c)(2)(viii).The proposed amendments would also delete a provision from paragraph (c)(2)(ix)of Rule 15c3-1 that expired on January 1, 1983. <ITAG tagnum="84">VI. Summary of Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis </ITAG>The Commission has prepared an Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis(``Analysis'') in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 603 regarding the proposed amendments.The Analysis notes that the objective of the proposed amendments is tofurther the purposes of the various financial responsibility rules whichprovide safeguards with respect to the financial responsibility and relatedpractices of brokers and dealers. In sum, the Analysis states that theproposed amendments would subject smaller broker-dealers to higher capitalrequirements. A copy of the Analysis may be obtained by contacting DavidI.A.
