The stock market clipped 8.8% off UAL's stock price in the next six trading days, while five of its airline competitors were declining an average of only 1.8%.    In a typical reaction, money manager Charles Allmon, who runs the Growth Stock Outlook Trust in Bethesda, Md., griped, &quot;I don't know where they get all these funny names. Three out of four, I want to run the other way.&quot;    UAL's new name, meant to encompass its hotel and car-rental units as well as its airline, is the latest in a rash of corporate name changes, which numbered a record 1,382 last year. Mergers account for half the total, but many industrial companies are dumping dowdy smokestack names for made-up words that sound like new planets or distant galaxies.    It might seem from the derisive reaction to Allegis that many other new-name companies would have suffered on Wall Street. But a surprising number of the new incarnations -- including Unisys, Enron and Trinova -- have outperformed the stock market lately.    Unisys Corp., the new name for the combined Burroughs and Sperry computer companies, has beaten the Standard andamp; Poor's Corp. 500 index by 18.1 percentage points since the new name took effect Nov. 25.    Enron Corp., a group of gas pipeline companies formerly known as HNG/InterNorth Inc., has slightly outperformed the Sandamp;P since its rechristening last April 10. And Trinova Corp., reborn Aug. 1 when its predecessor sold the Libbey-Owens-Ford name along with its auto glass business, has beaten the market by 23.9 points with its remaining pumps and plastics operations.    Some money managers think a new name can be a sign of positive change, particularly if it follows some traumatic experience. &quot;It's usually the beginning of a good sign,&quot; says private investor James Rogers.    &quot;If a company goes almost bankrupt and finally starts cleaning up its act&quot; and changes its name in the process, Mr. Rogers says, it could mean &quot;they're far enough along in a turnaround or restructuring that maybe you should look at it.&quot; But he cautions that a name change isn't a sign the stock is definitely going to rise -- only &quot;that you should take a look.&quot;    A space-age name alone, however, can't make up for a deeply depressed business. International Harvester, a heavy truck maker, and Massey-Ferguson, a farm equipment maker, have fared little better on Wall Street since their rebirth as Navistar International Corp. and Varity Corp.    Navistar has trailed the market by a hefty 41.8 percentage points in the year since its name change Feb. 20, 1986. Varity has underperformed by 31.2 points since its name change last June 17.    Corporate identity consultants who make millions helping companies decide what to call themselves confess that they don't know how name changes affect company stock prices, if at all.    &quot;There's no question that there is a relationship,&quot; says Clive Chajet, chairman of Lippincott andamp; Margulies Inc., the consultant that invented Allegis for UAL. &quot;But there are so many variables that affect the price of the stock. It would be stretching a point to say a company did great or poorly based on a new name.&quot;    Suresh Bihrud, a stock market strategist at First Boston Corp., says a name change might help a stock only 10% to 20% of the time. &quot;Repackaging old wine in a new bottle is not going to bring a higher price. In the long run, the market always goes by underlying fundamentals.&quot;    David Borger, research director at Wilshire Asset Management, agrees that investors see through name changes when a company's fundamentals aren't going well. &quot;My own personal judgment is that it's a waste of time,&quot; Mr. Borger says. &quot;And yet, deep down inside, I guess there's probably some value there, even though I'd be hard pressed to identify it.&quot;    Many of the name changes reflect a wish to shuck off a word or a name that has a bad association for investors. That was one reason U.S. Steel changed its name to USX Corp. after more than a decade of badly underperforming the market along with other steel companies.    Even though U.S. Steel had branched into energy, it was still followed by steel analysts, says Tim King, senior vice president of Siegel andamp; Gale, the consultant that engineered the USX switch. He adds, &quot;If you're in an industry that's got a bad reputation, you've got a bad reputation.&quot;    The &quot;X&quot; in the new name came from U.S. Steel's stock trading symbol, which underscores the reality that an important audience for the new company name is always the financial community. Since the change took effect July 9, USX has outperformed the market by 28.4 points, partly because of a rebound in energy prices and a takeover threat by Carl Icahn.    USX is unnatural enough, but many of the other new names are simply made up. The reason: Most words in the dictionary are taken. Mr. Chajet says 15 of the 20 names Lippincott proposed for UAL were unavailable.    But making up new words can be hazardous. When Exxon Corp.'s predecessor was seeking a new name in 1972, one of the candidates was Enco. But that meant &quot;stalled car&quot; in Japanese.    Lippincott itself suffered an embarrassment last summer when it came up with &quot;Enteron&quot; as a new name for HNG/InterNorth. The logic was impeccable: The prefix &quot;en&quot; for energy. The suffix &quot;on&quot; as homage to such energy giants as Exxon and Chevron Corp. And a &quot;ter&quot; in the middle to make a word out of it.    Only trouble was, it turned out that even though it had been made up, &quot;enteron&quot; was in the dictionary. It's a medical term for the alimentary canal, the passage in the body through which food travels, starting at the mouth and ending just beyond the intestines. After much snickering among the gas pipeline company's holders, the name was shortened to Enron.    Many banks have dropped their home bases from their names to signal that they want to expand into a wider region. But one money manager contends that -- although the companies wouldn't acknowledge it -- Comerica Inc. and NBD Bancorp, formerly Detroit Bank and National Bank of Detroit, also changed their names to ditch the word Detroit.    However, Mr. Chajet says, changing a name while under pressure can backfire. For example, he said, Bradford Trust changed its name in February 1985 to Fidata Corp. with Lippincott's help after becoming embroiled in a series of government securities scandals. But the day the change was announced, Mr. Chajet says, another scandal broke, &quot;and they were perceived as the same old scandal-ridden company.&quot; Fidata has since lagged the market by 110.3 points.    The performance of Figgie International Inc. shows that even the most unusual names can work if the fundamentals are there. Figgie got its name in 1981 from its chairman, Henry E. Figgie Jr., who had run the company for 17 years, first as Automatic Sprinkler Corp. then as A-T-O. The latter name was borrowed from what was then the company's stock ticker symbol.    At the time, Mr. Figgie, who had also taken the company into construction equipment and sporting goods, denied being on &quot;an ego trip.&quot; And in fact, per-share earnings are up 50% since then, and Figgie stock has far outdistanced the market.    A well-known consumer brand name can also help Wall Street recognize a company. Consolidated Foods has outperformed the market by nearly 60 points since changing its name to Sara Lee Corp. in March 1985. But jettisoning a brand with distracting associations, as Tampax did in becoming Tambrands Inc. in April 1984, can also help. Tambrands has beaten the market by 74 points.    Citicorp, one of the granddaddies of jazzy new bank names, has lagged the market since its arrival in 1974, reflecting what the foreign debt crisis and other credit problems have done to most money-center bank stocks.    Joel Portugal of Anspach Grossman Portugal, another corporate identity consultant, says it's too early to condemn Allegis, even though it's the work of his main competitor. &quot;You don't judge a new name in one day,&quot; he says. &quot;Whether or not a new name works depends on how it lives over time.&quot;    Mr. Chajet says: &quot;It's our experience that every name introduced is greeted by derision and controversy and big yuk-yuk. But normally, we get the last laugh.&quot;    ---           HOW SOME STOCKS DID AFTER NAME CHANGES             Date                             Sandamp;P New Name   Changed    Old Name      Stock*    500   DIFF** Unisys    11/25/86    Burroughs     32.8%    14.7  + 18.1 Trinova    8/01/86    Libbey-       46.5     22.6  + 23.9                       Owens-Ford USX        7/09/86    U.S. Steel    47.2     18.8  + 28.4 Varity     6/17/86    Massey-      -13.0     18.2  - 31.2                       Ferguson Enron      4/10/86    HNG/          26.3     23.1  +  3.2                       Internorth Navistar   2/20/86    Int'l        -10.3     31.5  - 41.8 Int'l                 Harvester Fidata     2/20/85    Bradford     -41.9     68.4  -110.3                       National Figgie     6/01/81    A-T-O        326.9*** 113.0  +213.9 Int'l Citicorp   3/26/74    First Nat'l   26.7*** 189.2  -162.5                       City Corp.
