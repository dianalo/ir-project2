The FDIC transferred the insured deposits of two of the banks -- First Bank andamp; Trust Co., Booker, Texas, and Lago Vista National Bank, Lago Vista, Texas -- to other institutions because the agency received no suitable bids for their purchase. The third, Landmark National Bank, Denver, was purchased by another institution.    First Bank andamp; Trust's office is to reopen tomorrow as a branch of First National Bank of Perryton, Perryton, Texas. The failed bank had assets of $88.5 million and held deposits of $78.4 million in 7,500 accounts.    Those deposits included $1.8 million in 183 accounts that exceeded the federal insurance limit of $100,000 for each depositor. Holders of those deposits will share proportionately with the FDIC the proceeds from the liquidation of the failed bank's assets.    First National has agreed to pay the FDIC a $10,000 premium for the right to receive the deposits and to purchase certain assets of the failed bank for $29 million.    The sole office of Lago Vista National, closed yesterday by the U.S. Comptroller of the Currency, is to reopen today as a branch of Greater Texas Bank Leander, Leander, Texas. The failed bank had assets of $11.3 million and held $10.6 million in 1,900 deposit accounts.    Thirty-one accounts held a total of $34,700 that exceeded the federal deposit insurance limit. The FDIC is making an advance payment of one-half of the uninsured deposits to the owners of those accounts.    If the subsequent liquidation of the failed bank's assets yields more than the money advanced, those depositors will share the proceeds proportionately. If the sale yields less money, the FDIC insurance fund will absorb the loss.    Greater Texas has agreed to pay the FDIC a premium of $50,100 for the right to receive the failed bank's deposits and to purchase other assets of Lago Vista National for $5.7 million.    These were the 24th and 25th banks to fail in Texas this year.    Landmark National's office, closed yesterday by the Comptroller, is to reopen today as Omnibank Leetsdale, a newly chartered subsidiary of Omnibancorp, Denver. The failed bank had assets of $10.7 million and deposits of $9.1 million in 1,500 accounts.    The acquiring bank has agreed to pay the FDIC a $37,500 purchase premium and to buy Landmark National assets for $7.2 million. The FDIC will advance the new bank $3.1 million and retain assets of the failed bank valued at $3.5 million.    Landmark National was the seventh Colorado bank to fail this year. </TEXT></DOC>
