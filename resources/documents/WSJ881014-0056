Production will be handled by Toyota Industrial Equipment Mfg. Inc. near Columbus, Ind. Toyota said the venture will be capitalized at $40 million, with Toyoda Automatic Loom Works Ltd. holding an 80% stake and Toyota Motor the remainder. Toyota Motor owns 24.9% of Toyoda Automatic Loom Works.    Toyota said about 150 people will be employed at the 280,000-square-foot plant in Indiana. Production should total about 5,000 forklifts a year and sales will be handled through dealers &quot;associated with&quot; the Japanese auto maker's U.S. car and truck dealer network, Toyota said.    The venture will build three models of the vehicles, which are used to lift and carry heavy loads; the forklifts will have loading capacities of between one and three tons.    The U.S. International Trade Commission last May determined that Toyota, along with several other Japanese companies, had been &quot;dumping&quot; forklifts in the U.S. -- selling the equipment at prices below those in the home market or below production costs. But a spokeswoman for the company's U.S. sales arm said Toyota had been considering U.S. production before the ruling. </TEXT></DOC>
