The official, T. Milton Street, yelled at the judge handling hiscase Wednesday, then sat in her chair for most of the afternoon inprotest.   President Judge George Twardy, who suspended Street last week,said he decided to fire Street when he saw pictures of Street inJudge Lillian Podgorski's chair.   ``That is not right,'' Twardy said. ``I'll tell you the truth,I'm not going to stand for it.''   Street, a former state senator, was an assistant budget directorfor the court.   Twardy also fired Street's son, T. Milton Street Jr., a courtofficer who was suspended when he wouldn't pay for nine tickets.The son accompanied his father during Wednesday's sit-in, whichended when police asked them to leave as the office closed for theday.   Street was back in Traffic Court on Thursday, getting paperworkfor an appeal of his case.   He said he also would challenge the firing. ``Even with my bigmouth, I have rights,'' Street said.   Street has 26 outstanding tickets and owes $2,559 in fines.Twardy also said Street had six outstanding tickets in othercounties, including one from the Poconos.   ``Not only that, but over the last 11 years, he hasn't had alicense or insurance,'' Twardy said.   Street, who is black, has maintained that requiring a deposit -$100 in his case - for a Traffic Court hearing is unconstitutionaland unfair to poor people, notably blacks and Hispanics.   ``Poor people think I'm a hero,'' he said.   Street said that he and his son would start a consulting servicefor people facing Traffic Court.   ``I'd save them thousands of dollars,'' he said. ``I'd advisethem of their rights.''</TEXT></DOC>
