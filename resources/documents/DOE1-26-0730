The enthusiastic initiativestaken in many countries for the development of alternative energy sourceshave withered due to lack of economic and/or ideological incentive. Theevents since December 1985, when the members of OPEC decided to increaseproduction in an effort to capture their share of market, have broughtdown the prices of a barrel of crude to less than US $11 and have madeany rational analysis very complex. This has made even the proponentsof the alternative energy sources pause and think. The US has, as usual,oscillated from panic to complacency. The Libyan crisis, however, hasbrought the dangers of complacency into sharp focus. The first commercialcoal gasification plant, constructed with a capital investment of overUS $2 billion, was abandoned by the owners and is being operated by theUS Department of Energy temporarily. In their effort to find a privateowner, the US Department of Energy has set the date of auction of thisprestigious plant for May 28, 1986. And if an appropriate bid is notforthcoming, the plant faces a very uncertain future. Coal, consideredby the World Coal Study (WOCOL) at MIT in 1980, to be a bridge to a globalenergy future, seems to have lost its luster due to the oil glut whichwe all know is temporary. This was evident when the bill to grant theRight of Eminent Domain for transportation of coal was defeated. Thisconference was organized to bring together experts in different areasfrom various countries to discuss the state of the art and the rate ofprogress in different alternative energy forms. The recent accident atthe Chernobyl nuclear power plant in USSR has brought home the need ofdiversification of the alternative energy sources.</TEXT></DOC>
