Background</ITAG>Section 3004 of the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985(COBRA), Pub. L. 99-272, amended section 4 of the United States HousingAct of 1937 (USH Act) by authorizing the Secretary of HUD to cancel anyloan made by the Secretary under section 4(a) of the USH Act that has anyprincipal amount outstanding or any interest amount outstanding or accrued(other than loans the repayment of which was not to be made using annualcontributions). The amendment expressly provides that ``the terms and conditionsof any contract, or any amendment to a contract, for such loan with respectto any promise to repay such principal and interest shall be canceled.''The amendment also provides that ``such cancellation shall not affect anyother terms and conditions of such contract, which shall remain in effectas if the cancellation had not occurred.'' This provision does not expresslymandate continued operation of the public or Indian housing project butdoes preserve ``any other terms and conditions'' of the Annual ContributionsContract (ACC) which are to ``remain in effect as if the cancellation hadnot occurred.''There are other requirements which pertain to continued operation of projects.HUD regulations at 24 CFR Part 969 provide that PHAs which receive operatingsubsidy under section 9 of the USH Act must maintain the lower income natureof the public housing project for a period of ten years after the end ofthe last PHA fiscal year for which operating subsidy is paid with respectto the project. The requirement applies notwithstanding the completionof debt service, and the payment of annual contributions for such debtservice, on the project.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Implementation of COBRA </ITAG>The loan forgiveness legislation is not self-executing. Section 3004 authorizesthe Secretary to cancel the loans. In order to facilitate an efficient,harmonious process of cancellation, the Department on August 4, 1987, issuedHUD Notice PIH 87-12 captioned ``Public and Indian Housing Rental Developmentand Modernization_Forgiveness and Excess Financing.'' This Notice implementedthe COBRA loan forgiveness provisions by prescribing a method for determiningthe amount to be forgiven and by providing a form of amendment to the ACC(``Lower Income Public and Indian Housing Debt Forgiveness Amendment toConsolidated Annual Contributions Contract,'' hereafter ``the ACC Amendment'')to accomplish the cancellation of the loan. This form of amendment notonly effects the cancellation of loans for applicable development and modernizationprojects but also addresses the disposition of public and Indian housingprojects and the effects of loan cancellation on residual receipts fromrental and Turnkey III projects. While many PHAs have executed the amendment, many others have expressedconcern about its effect in three respects. First, PHAs have questionedthe rationale and operation of the related provisions dealing with dispositionand residual receipts. Second, some PHAs have contended that where theloan is forgiven pursuant to COBRA and the PHA does not receive operatingsubsidy for the project, it should receive ``programmatic relief'' fromthe provisions of the ACC and, generally, from the USH Act and its regulations,Third, some PHAs and PHA organizations have inquired why any amendmentof the ACC is necessary. In response to these concerns, by memorandum of December 11, 1987, HUDadvised its Field Offices that the policies in HUD Notice PIH 87-12 callingfor execution of the debt forgiveness ACC Amendment were temporarily suspended.It further advised that this Statement of Policy would be issued. ThisStatement of Policy is principally directed to answering those three questions.In addition, concerns have also been raised regarding the impact of COBRAon ``old'' mutual help homeownership projects (i.e., projects developedprior to March 9, 1976). Some interested parties contend that COBRA triggersprovisions in the ``old'' mutual help homeownership agreement executedbetween the IHA and the mutual help participant providing for immediatetransfer of the housing authority's interest in the homeownership unitto the participant. The homeownership agreement for the Homeownership Programfor Low-Income Families, also known as the ``old'' Turnkey III Program(i.e., projects developed prior to October 9, 1973), contains similar language.This Statement of Policy will also address the impact of COBRA on theseagreements. The <T3>current </T3>mutual help and Turnkey III programs use revised homeownershipagreements which do not raise concerns related to transfer of the unitto the homebuyer as a result of COBRA. Nevertheless, this statement ofPolicy shall address implementation of loan forgiveness for these homeownershipprograms too. (Hereafter the terms Turnkey III ``homebuyers'' and mutualhelp ``participants'' shall be referred to as ``homebuyers''). <ITAG tagnum="84">III. Ancillary Provisions of ACC Amendment </ITAG>Specific questions have been raised with respect to two elements of theACC Amendment dealing with project disposition and with residual receipts.Paragraph 6.d. of the ACC Amendment would insert a new section 308(B) ofthe ACC which is not based on loan forgiveness under section 3004. Instead,it implements the provisions of section 18 of the USH Act, as added bythe Housing and Urban-Rural Recovery Act of 1983, being titles I throughV of the Domestic Housing and International Recovery and Financial StabilityAct, Pub. L. 98-181 November 30, 1983). Section 18 (which recently wasfurther amended by section 121 of the Housing and Community DevelopmentAct of 1987 (Pub. L. 100-242, February 5, 1988) and which amendments willbe the subject of rulemaking) governs the disposition of public and Indianhousing projects. The ACC Amendment essentially tracked the statutory andregulatory implementation of section 18. Question has been raised specifically about the deletion of existing Section308(B), which governs the disposition of ``excess real property'' of aPHA, and the substitution of the new text. Some PHAs have expressed concernthat the ACC Amendment would make contractual requirements of what arenow ``only'' statutory and regulatory provisions and that while HUD canwaive the regulations, it might be more difficult to change the contract.The Department disagrees with this construction of the contractual provisions.First, as noted, the disposition provisions must be followed as a matterof statute under section 18. Second, if the Department were inclined towaive the regulation, presumably it would be equally amenable to modifying,or waiving, the contractual provision for the same purpose. Concern has also been expressed about a perceived difference between theregulation and the ACC Amendment which latter provision has been read asnot authorizing the use of disposition proceeds to acquire lower incomehousing. Section 18 authorizes among the eligible uses of net proceedsto provide housing assistance for lower income housing or the <T3>acquisition, </T3>development, or rehabilitation of other propertiesto operate as lower income housing'' (emphasis added). The eligibilityprovisions of andSection;970.9(b)(2) of the regulation use the same language.The word ``acquisition'' was inadvertently omitted from the ACC Amendment.Although it is arguable that the term ``development'' embraces acquisition,the form of ACC Amendment will be changed to specify acquisition becausethe statute and the regulation both mention acquisition explicitly. The second ancillary provision which some PHAs have questioned is paragraph6.e. which would amend section 416(C) of the ACC to include a statementthat_<ITAG tagnum="21">If no further annual contributions for either debt service or operationsare payable, the Local Authority [i.e., PHA] shall deposit any residualreceipts into a replacement reserve to be used to reduce the future needfor annual contributions to modernize its projects.</ITAG>Existing section 416(C) of the ACC implements the statutory requirementthat residual receipts be applied to the reduction of annual contributions,and PHAs are required under current procedures to remit residual receiptsdirectly to HUD. Thus, while there will no longer be debt service to payoff, still the ACC requires that residual receipts continue to flow tothe Department. Section 6(e) of the USH Act requires that the ACC providethat_<ITAG tagnum="21">* * * whenever in any year the receipts of a public housing agencyin connection with a lower income housing project exceed its expenditures(including debt service, operation, maintenance, establishment of reserve,and other costs and charges), an amount equal to such excess shall be applied,or set aside for application, to purposes which in the determination ofthe Secretary, will effect a reduction in the amount of subsequent annualcontributions.</ITAG>Note that section 6(e) does not limit the mandatory use of residual receiptsfor debt service, but instead relates to ``purposes'' generally which ``willeffect a reduction in the amount of subsequent annual contributions.''  Existing section 416(C) has implemented the statutory requirement to dateby providing that such residual receipts from rental projects and TurnkeyIII projects be used to reduce annual contributions for debt service. Nowthat the loans are forgiven, the Department is seeking to meet the requirementsof section 6(e), but in a way that will benefit the specific project. Accordingly,the provision in the ACC amendment under review would provide for the dedicationof residual receipts in order, in the words of the statute, to ``effecta reduction in the amount of subsequent annual contributions.'' To makethe residual receipts available to the PHA, the Department has positedthe following rationale: If these funds are put into a replacement reserve,that usage will have the effect of deferring and perhaps deterring a futureneed for modernization assistance.However, some PHAs have not understood the reason for this provision. Theyhave questioned whether, if the ACC is not amended, the elimination ofdebt service because of loan forgiveness means that the contractual dutyhas expired. Further, retention of such residual receipts by the PHA, ithas been argued, would not be netted out under PFS (Performance FundingSystem) calculations of operating subsidy. The Department believes thatan exclusive focus on contractual duty, as manifested by the PHAs' positiondescribed above, ignores the statutory requirement of section 6(e), a requirementincluded in the United States Housing Act of 1937 long before the establishmentof operating subsidy under section 9 of that Act. That is why the ACC Amendmentprovides for a vehicle that accomplishes two major objectives: (1) Satisfyingthe statutory mandate that residual receipts be used in a way that ``willeffect a reduction in the amount of subsequent annual contributions'' and(2) allowing those funds to remain with the PHA which has generated them,when no further annual contributions are payable on its projects, ratherthan being remitted to HUD for reduction of annual contributions generally.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. ``Programmatic Relief''</ITAG>By ``programmatic relief'' is meant that proposal, advanced by some, typicallysmaller PHAs, which would relieve the PHA from compliance with the requirementsof the ACC with respect to any project that (1) has its loan forgiven underCOBRA and (2) receives no operating subsidy. This proposal has largelybeen limited to PHAs satisfying the foregoing two criteria because section9(a)(2) of the USH Act provides that operating subsidy may be providedafter the duration of the ACC paying off development costs only ``as longas the lower income nature of such project is maintained.'' The Departmenthas construed the quoted requirement to mean maintenance of lower incomehousing in accordance with the requirements of the Federal USH Act.As noted in Part I, COBRA provides that the cancellation thereunder ofany loan under an ACC ``shall not affect any other terms and conditionsof such contract, which shall remain in effect as if the cancellation hadnot occurred.'' Because this provision ensures that the ACC remains wholeand in effect upon loan forgiveness, there is no statutory ambiguity asto the continued vitality of the ACC.However, proponents of programmatic relief have pointed to what is viewedas a contractual ambiguity. Specifically, they refer to section 518 ofthe ACC which provides that:<ITAG tagnum="21">Upon payment in full of all indebtedness of the Local Authority inconnection with any Project for which annual contributions are pledged,and upon payment of any other indebtedness of the Local Authority in connectionwith such Project to the Government, all obligations of the Governmentand the Local Authority under this Contract with respect to such Projectshall cease and determine except as provided in Part One of this Contractand this Contract shall terminate as to such Project.</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Similar language is found in Article 14.11 of the Mutual Help ACC.Thus, under the express terms of the ACC, its obligations cease ``uponpayment in full of all indebtedness.'' But, proponents of programmaticrelief assert, by virtue of the loan cancellation under COBRA there neverwill be payment ``in full of all indebtedness.''As the Department has explored the reach of the contractual ambiguity,we have received comments not only from interested PHAs but also from Congressionalleaders who were instrumental in drafting and enacting COBRA. On March23, 1988, the Chairman of the House Committee on Banking, Finance and UrbanAffairs, and the Chairman and then Ranking Minority Member of the HouseSubcommittee on Housing and Community Development wrote to the Departmentnoting their understanding that the Department had been ``in the processof determining the best way to implement the statutory changes.'' In thiscontext they concluded that ``no other reasonable interpretation is consistentwith the law and the intent of the amendment'' than that the ACC continuesto be applicable, whether or not operating subsidies are received. On June8, 1988, the Ranking Minority Member and another member of the Senate Committeeon Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs expressed their views favoring programmaticrelief and requesting a status report.The Department responded to all of these Congressional leaders, expresslyrecognizing the clarity of COBRA and the ambiguity of section 518 and concludingthat the cancellation of the loan should not and could not have the effectof extending the terms of the contract in perpetuity, even though therenever will be payment ``in full of all indebtedness.'' At the same time,the Department noted that it is not aware of any explicit provision inthe COBRA statute, or suggestion in its legislative history, that obligationsunder the ACC should be terminated upon loan cancellation on the groundsthe indebtedness will never be paid in full. For these reasons, HUD's implementationof loan forgiveness steers the course between these two extremes. Thatis, the Department interprets the loan forgiveness legislation as providingfor the ACC to run to the full term at which it otherwise would have terminatedhad there not been cancellation of the loan. This Statement of Policy isintended to make clear that the originally contracted for term is neitherextended nor abbreviated by virtue of loan forgiveness under the ACC. Therefore,the Department does not believe programmatic relief is a viable optionwithin HUD's administrative discretion.<ITAG tagnum="84">V. Homeownership Projects </ITAG>Generally, the definition, issues, rationale and Departmental policiesregarding ``programmatic relief'' for the conventional public and Indianhousing programs are equally applicable to the Turnkey III and mutual helphomeownership programs. However, the applicability of section 3004 to homeownership projects hasraised additional issues. The Department here addresses the proposal advancedby some individuals that the loan forgiveness provisions under COBRA triggercontractual provisions in the old mutual help homeownership agreements(as well as old Turnkey III homeownership agreements) executed betweenthe PHA and the homebuyer which provide for transfer/conveyance of theinterest of the PHA in the homeownership unit to the homebuyer upon paymentof the development debt on the home.These proponents refer to section 5.c. of the ``old'' Mutual-Help and OccupancyAgreement (HUD-53033 July 1967) as the basis for their position. Section17.a. of the ``old'' Turnkey III Homebuyers Ownership Agreement containssimilar language. Section 5.c. provides: <ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>When payment of the debt is complete,</T3> the Authority will grant,assign and/or convey to the Participant the maximum interest in the Participant'shouse and grounds that it can give, and the Authority and the Participantwill each release the other from any further obligations under this Agreement(emphasis added).</ITAG>Section 17.a. provides: <ITAG tagnum="21">The Homebuyer will be entitled to ownership when<T3> his share of the capital debt of the development * * * is fully paid</T3>(emphasis added).</ITAG>In addressing the impact of COBRA on the contractual language in thesehomeownership agreements, the Department has reviewed the Congressionalintent and the express language of section 3004, as well as the programobjectives, program requirements, expectations created, and express languageof the homeownership agreements. We have concluded that loan forgiveness is limited in its applicabilityto these homeownership projects. To the extent loan forgiveness is applicable,it does not result in immediate conveyance of the homeownership units tothe homebuyers. As noted in Part I, section 3004 amended section 4 of the 1937 Act to authorizeloan forgiveness. The last sentence of new section 4(c)(1) provides exceptionsto the applicability of loan forgiveness and specifically provides: <ITAG tagnum="21">This paragraph<T3> shall not apply to any loan</T3> the<T3> repayment of which was not to be made using annual contributions,</T3>or to any loan<T3> all or part of the proceeds of which are due a public housing agencyfrom</T3> contractors or<T3> others</T3> (emphasis added). </ITAG>The debt on these homeownership projects was not to be repaid solely withannual contributions, but with payments from the homebuyer to the PHA.In the case of old mutual help projects, section 5.a. of the Mutual HomeownershipAgreement clearly provides that ``the Authority will use the `annual contributions'from the Government<T3> and</T3> the<T3> Participant's payments''</T3> to pay interest and principal on thedebt (emphasis added). These homebuyer payments consist of equity paymentsand payments from an operating reserve. The old Turnkey III program operatesin a similar manner. As a result, it is necessary to separate and determine that portion ofthe debt repayable with annual contributions (which is eligible for loanforgiveness under section 3004) and that portion of the debt due to thePHA from the homebuyer and repayable from other than annual contributions(which is not eligible for loan forgiveness). According to program design,these are determinations which are based on a formula that takes into considerationseveral variable factors (e.g., homebuyer's annual income, the ACC loanrate, the amount of annual contributions, etc.) over the term of the ACCand homeownership agreement. Such determinations cannot be ascertainedprospectively. Accordingly, the Department has determined to implement loan forgivenessfor homeownership projects incrementally on the amount of the debt repayablewith annual contributions in accordance with such accounting proceduresand formulas as have been established for determining the amount of annualcontributions payable over the term of the ACC and homeownership agreement.Since loan forgiveness is not applicable to that portion of the debt payableby the homebuyer to the PHA, those amounts are not eligible for loan forgivenessand are due to the authority in accordance with the terms of the homeownershipagreement. Consequently, the homeownership agreements must run their entireterm. To the extent that loan forgiveness is applicable to the homeownershipprojects, it does not trigger immediate conveyance of the homeownershipunits to the homebuyers in accordance with sections 5.c. and 17.a. of themutual help and Turnkey III agreements respectively. Under the expressterms of the mutual help homeownership agreement, the IHA is to transferits interests ``when payment of the debt is complete.'' However, as inthe case with Article 14.11 of the ACC (and as demonstrated above in thediscussion of ``programmatic relief'' under Part IV), there will neverbe complete ``payment of the debt'' as contemplated by section 5. As a result, the Department concludes that it would not be consistent withthe objectives of these homeownership programs to continue the agreementsin perpetuity or until such time as a homebuyer's payments alone (withoutthe benefit of annual contributions) would equal the balance required topay off the original indebtedness on the home.Yet it appears equally inappropriate, based on program design and objectivesand the original expectations of the parties, to invoke the provisionsof sections 5.c. or 17.a. of the homeownership agreements to grant, assign,or convey the Authority's interest in the unit to the participant basedupon a simplistic application of the loan forgiveness legislation. As indicatedearlier, loan forgiveness is limited in its applicability to homeownershipprojects and its applicability does not resolve all the conditions precedentto conveyance of a homeowership unit.For these reasons, and analogous to our handling of ``programmatic relief''expounded at Part IV, HUD's contractual interpretation of the effect ofloan forgiveness on the ``old'' homeowership projects steers the coursebetween the two extremes. As in the case of section 518 and article 14.11of the ACC, the Department interprets the effect of loan forgiveness onthe homeowership agreements as providing for the agreements to run thefull term at which they would otherwise have terminated had there not beenforgiven of the loan. This statement of Policy is intended to make clearthat the loan term originally contracted for under the ACC is neither extendednor abbreviated by virtue of loan forgiveness.The impact of COBRA on the <T3>current </T3>mutual help and Turnkey III homeownership programs leadsto a similar result. As in the case with ``old'' mutual help and TurnkeyIII programs, a portion of the debt is due to the PHA from the homebuyerand repayable from other than annual contributions. Accordingly, theseamounts are not eligible for loan forgiveness and the homeownership agreementsmust run their entire term before a determination of the amounts repayableout of annual contributions and homebuyer payments can be made. Since theconveyance of units under the current programs is tied to a purchase priceschedule_and not directly to project debt_issues regarding conveyance applicableto the ``old'' mutual help or Turnkey III programs do not arise. <ITAG tagnum="84">VI. Amendment of ACC</ITAG>Several PHAs have questioned the necessity for, and the effect of, executingthe ACC Amendment in connection with cancellation of the loan. For example,the National Association of Housing and Redevelopment officials issuedon ``Action Alert'' on September 22, 1987, referring to HUD Notice PIH87-12 (since temporarily suspended, as noted in Part III), and assertingthat ``the proposed ACC amendment, in apparent violation of'' the provisionin COBRA that loan cancellation shall not effect any other terms in theACC, ``nullifies Section 518.'' Others have expressed concern that executionof the ACC Amendment concedes that the ACC remains in effect, despite thecancellation of the debt. As explained in Part IV, the Department's policyis that the ACC does remain in effect, notwithstanding the cancellationof the debt. Indeed, this policy gives meaning to the provision in COBRAthat the cancellation ``shall not affect any other terms and conditionsof such contract which shall remain in effect.''Nevertheless, it may still be asked_and some PHAs have done so_whetherthere is a need to amend the ACC in order for the loan to be cancelled.As indicated earlier in this Statement of Policy, the Department's intentionin drafting and submitting to PHAs a form of ACC Amendment was to effectan expeditious and harmonious cancellation of the debt and to provide avehicle for ensuring that PHAs can retain residual receipts which wouldotherwise have to be returned to the Federal Government. A related purposeof the ACC Amendment was to elicit the cooperation of PHAs in establishingthe amount of the debt to be cancelled. In this regard, paragraphs 2 and3 of HUD Notice PIH 87-12 provided instructions for determining the amountof the loan to be forgiven, including submission by PHAs of Actual DevelopmentCost Certificates (ADCCs) and Actual Modernization Cost Certificates (AMCCs),which documentation will indicate the amount of loan authority actuallyused in project development or modernization. Such determinations normallywould be an area in which PHAs have an important self-interest in beingsatisfied that the appropriate amount of the loan eligible for forgivenessis identified. This is particularly so since PHAs are required to repayto HUD any excess financing provided by development or modernization loans.There is no intrinsic legal requirement for amending the ACC in this connection.Section 405(B) of the ACC already requires the PHA to submit an ADCC/AMCCto HUD. The determination of the actual development/modernization costcontained in the certificate so approved by HUD is final and conclusivefor all purposes of the ACC. But section 405(C) further provides that_<ITAG tagnum="21">If the Local Authority shall unduly delay in the submission of theActual Development Cost Certificate for any Project, the Government maygive notice to the Local Authority that the amount of the Development Costof such Project incurred to the date of such notice shall be consideredto be the Actual Development Cost of such Project, and such notice shallconstitute the Actual Development Cost Certificate for such Project forall the purposes of this Contract.</ITAG>Accordingly, if a PHA does not wish to execute the ACC amendment for loanforgiveness, it is entirely within HUD's authority under the ACC to calculatethe actual development or modernization cost and to cancel the loan onthat basis. This could have the effect of establishing an outstanding liabilityon the part of the PHA for amounts determined by HUD to be excess financing.The Department has been operating with the understanding that PHAs' self-interestwould constitute an incentive for collaboration in the determination ofactual development/modernization cost through the ACC Amendment process.The Department is still of this view. But in no way does HUD intent to<T3>require</T3> PHAs to enter into such an ACC Amendment if for theirown reasons there appear to be disincentives for doing so. From HUD's standpoint,there is an administrative disincentive in unilaterally calculating actualdevelopment/modernization costs because it would necessitate recourse toextensive calculations under old and sometimes difficult to retrieve documentation.Nevertheless, such unilateral determination is legally feasible, even ifadministratively burdensome to HUD.In any event, the Department will proceed with loan forgiveness, whetheror not the PHA executes the amendment.In this connection, the Department still recommends the execution of theACC Amendment for loan forgiveness, but such execution is not a conditionfor loan cancellation. (Of course, absent an amendment to the ACC, PHAswill still be bound under the provisions of section 416(c) to return residualreceipts to HUD.) PHAs will be asked individually to inform HUD as to whetherthey elect to amend the ACC; if not, a PHA board resolution to that effectshould be submitted.Although this Statement of Policy does not constitute rulemaking or promulgationof a final rule, the Department is of course interested in any views thatmay be helpful in providing information or other advice with respect tothe foregoing existing policy, which policy has been pursued by the Departmentsince late 1987 and is now formally applicable immediately.Comments regarding the advisability of executing or not executing ACC amendmentsor other aspect of this policy may be submitted to the Rules Docket Clerk,Office of General Counsel, Room 10276, Department of Housing and UrbanDevelopment, 451 7th Street SW., Washington, DC 20410. Each comment shouldinclude the commentor's name and address, and should refer to the titleand docket number stated in the heading of this Statement of Policy.
