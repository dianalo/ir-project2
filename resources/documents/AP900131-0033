Motorola had offered a similar service to clients in New York,Chicago and Los Angeles and had designed a nationwide in-housesystem for IBM service technicians. The companies said Tuesday theydecided to combine the networks to get a payback from hundreds ofmillions of invested dollars.   For Motorola, it provides a national radio network to market tonew clients. Ardis officials said Sears, Roebuck and Co. and NewYork Life Insurance Co. are among major companies testing thesystem.   Potential users include field service personnel such asequipment maintenance technicians, real estate brokers,package-delivery workers, police officers and insurance agents.   By using a hand-held terminal hooked to the radio network, amobile home appliance repairman could be told by his headquarterswhat service calls to make, and in turn could check on theavailability of parts from his company's warehouse.   The service, which will be available in April, would appear tobe in competition with cellular telephones. By using cellularphones and a modem, a portable computer can be hooked up to amainframe computer.   But IBM and Motorola say their system is more useful because itis on line all the time _ there's no need to dial up a computer. Inaddition, they say, it provides the ability to store and recallmessages that are sent to the terminal when the user is notmonitoring it. Cellular phones have difficulty penetratingbuildings made of certain materials, but the computer system wouldhave no such problems, the companies said.   IBM and Motorola would not disclose the amount they areinvesting in the 50-50 partnership, based in the Chicago suburb ofLincolnshire, Ill.   Exact pricing of the service has not been set, but it isexpected to cost about $100 to $150 a month per terminal.</TEXT></DOC>
