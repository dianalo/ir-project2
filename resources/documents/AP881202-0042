DOYLE</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   For the second time in two years, a Bronxcongressman is proclaiming his innocence in the Wedtech corruptionscandal.   U.S. Rep. Robert Garcia and his wife, Jane Lee Garcia, pleadedinnocent Thursday to charges they participated in a bribery andextortion scheme involving Wedtech Corp., a defunct defensecontractor.   ``I'm innocent and when the moment comes I'll be exonerated,''Garcia told reporters as the couple entered the courthouse.   Following their arraignment before a federal magistrate, the55-year-old Bronx Democrat and his 48-year-old wife were releasedwithout bail.   U.S. District Judge Leonard B. Sand set a tentative trial date ofJune 1, and scheduled a preliminary hearing for Jan. 3.   The Garcias and a lawyer from Puerto Rico, Ralph Vallone Jr., 41,were indicted last week in an alleged conspiracy to obtain $185,000in cash, interest-free loans and jewelry from Wedtech.   The indictment came just a few days after former U.S. Rep. MarioBiaggi, another Bronx Democrat, and four others were sentenced toprison for their conviction in a Wedtech-related racketeering trial.   Wedtech grew from a small machine shop into a multimillion-dollarbusiness through a series of no-bid government contracts obtainedthrough a federal minority business program.   Federal and state investigations uncovered a web of corruptioninvolving Wedtech payoffs extending from the Bronx to Washington.   The seven-count indictment accused Garcia of using his officialposition to demand and obtain payoffs from Wedtech, which washeadquartered in his congressional district.   Garcia, a congressman since 1978, is charged with extortion,conspiracy, bribery and receipt of illegal gratuities. His wife, 48,faces similar charges.</TEXT></DOC>
