(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A 15-year-old honor student charged withbreaking into a defense contractor's computer system was describedby police as a hacker on a lark.   ``He was having a gay old time of it,'' said DetectiveChristopher Poppe of the Nassau County Forgery Squad. ``For kids asbright as this one, getting into a system like Grumman is like afootball player scoring three touchdowns.''   The high school student has been charged with delinquency forcomputer tresspass in the computer system of Grumman Corp., anaerospace company, police said. Police withheld the Levittownteen-ager's name because he is a minor.   When the boy was arrested Wednesday night, apologized and turnedover computer disks containing Grumman data he retrieved on his$3,000 home computer.   ``He was very remorseful,'' said Poppe, who said it didn'tappear the youth intended to do any damage. ``He knew he didsomething wrong.''   Grumman officials said the youth didn't get any classified orsensitive information during his month of access to the company'sengineering minicomputer system.   The teen-ager, a student at Division Avenue High School andmember of the National Honor Society, got information on Grummancomputer procedures and a list of passwords for people with higherclearances.   The electronic break-in happened when the computer system'ssecurity devices were shut off for testing, said Grumman spokesmanRobert Harwood.   ``He didn't do any damage, but this is just not acceptablebehavior in a civilized society,'' Harwood said. ``It's like havingsomeone wander around in your living room.''</TEXT></DOC>
