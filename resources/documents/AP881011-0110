(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Michael Dukakis boosted economicnationalism while tossing barbs at his Republican opponentsTuesday, promising as president to restore American leadership inscience and technology and translate that into dominance of globalmarkets.   Dukakis said that he and Democratic running mate Lloyd Bentsenwould be aggressive advocates for U.S. companies and workers whileRepublican George Bush was ``satisfied with today and complacentabout tomorrow.''   Dukakis delighted the partisan crowd at Tufts University withnew salvos at the GOP ticket, saying the ``Republican campaign songseems to be, `Don't Worry; Be Happy,''' a tune played at a recentBush event.   ``I want us to be happy, but I also want us to be concerned,''Dukakis said. Then, lashing out at the bottom half of theRepublican ticket, he added: ``Dan Quayle asks us to believe thatif he ever had to fill in for George Bush, America could get by ona right wing and a prayer.''   Dukakis ticked off a six-point plan aimed at improving U.S.science teaching and technology as well as product development. Andhe spoke of the ``new economic patriotism'' that has become astaple of his attempt to win support from blue-collar workers andmiddle class voters concerned about their jobs and effects of thefederal budget and trade deficits.   ``We have a choice,'' Dukakis said. ``Will we keep running inplace or will we forge ahead? Will the future belong to ourcompetitors, or to us? Will we sell out more and more of our landand our factories and our banks, or will we take charge of ourfuture?''   ``Together we can build a future where the best products in theworld are designed by American minds, built by American hands andproduce good profits and good paychecks here on American soil,'' hesaid.   Bush, meanwhile, in a speech prepared for delivery to collegestudents in Seattle, accused Dukakis of ``protectionistdemagoguery'' in his criticism of foreign ownership of U.S.businesses.   ``My opponent needs an issue, and he's willing to scare peopleto find it,'' Bush said.   Dukakis, on another subject, also appeared on nationaltelevision to denounce what he called the ``crass and cynical''campaign tactics of Bush in connection with attacks on Dukakis assoft on crime. In addition, he attended a breakfast with Vietnamveterans and recipients of the Congressional Medal of Honor andspent several hours preparing for his second and final debate withBush Thursday night in Los Angeles.   Dukakis was flying to California later Tuesday.   At Tufts University, about two dozen Bush supporters gatheredoutside and chanted ``Bush '88'' as Dukakis arrived and left.   Inside, Dukakis declared, ``If we can build the greatestspaceship the world has ever seen, then we ought to be able tobuild the televisions and the VCRs that compete and that win inforeign markets.''   The six points discussed by Dukakis, most of them proposals hehas touched on earlier in the campaign, include:   _Having the National Science Foundation issue annual,state-by-state reports on the quality of science education.   _Establishing seminars to help science instructors improve theirteaching.   _Calling on scientists and engineers, including retirees, toteach classes.   _Persuading industry to set up worksite technology training andretraining centers.   _A nationwide network of centers of excellence modeled afterstate programs designed to foster research and new productdevelopment.   _Cooperation between U.S. companies in advanced technologiessuch as superconductivity and consumer electronics.   ``We need a commander in chief who stands up and fights forAmerican companies, American products and American jobs,'' saidDukakis, who said Bentsen would be his top deputy in the trade war.``I want us to begin selling cars and computers and compact discsto the Germans and the Japanese and the Koreans, not arms to theayatollah.''   Dukakis also joked about his ``October surprise,'' a speech lastweek in which he warned against growing foreign investment in theUnited States only to find out after the speech that the company atwhich he sounded the warning was owned by an Italian firm.   ``I'm not against foreign ownership,'' Dukakis said after makinglight of his mistake. ``I'm against the policies that make usdependent. I'm against a fire sale of America.''   During the morning telvision appearance Dukakis appeared upbeatabout the debate and repeated his contention that Bush wasexploiting a tragedy involving a Massachusetts furlough program forpolitical gain because of Bush's own failure as the Reaganadministration's point man on crime and drugs.   Speaking on NBC's ``Today'' program, he denounced Bush forrepeatedly detailing the violent assault of a Maryland couple by amurderer who escaped while on a Massachusetts furlough.   ``To use these human tragedies for your own political purposes,I think, is really a very crass and cynical thing,'' said Dukakis,who said similar tragedies have occurred in the federal furloughprogram and in one Ronald Reagan supported while governor ofCalifornia.</TEXT></DOC>
