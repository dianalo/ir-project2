Its rate of release from the human body is well known,and quantity of outdoor air required to maintain a desired level canbe calculated. Measurement of carbon dioxide levels in existing or energyefficient buildings are below the threshold limit value. To minimizeenergy requirements, carbon dioxide concentrations have been used tocontrol outdoor quantities in two buildings. The operation of the controlsystems proved there is a possible 20 to 40% saving of the energy requiredto ventilate buildings. Treatment of indoor air to remove indoor generatedcontaminants can minimize the amount of outdoor air and permit a greaterquantity of indoor air to be recirculated. The devices for building airtreatment are commercially available but it remains to be seen if theyare a more economic solution than the commonly used dilution method.Separate abstracts have been prepared for two papers from this document.</TEXT></DOC>
