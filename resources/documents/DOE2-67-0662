We discuss thedistribution and detectability of coherently interacting particles (suchas massive Dirac or scalar neutrinos, solar cosmions, and some Majoranafermions) that have been captured into orbits within the Earth. CoherentWIMP's in the mass range from 8 to 21 GeV in Earth orbits would giverise to count rates {similar_to}(1--1000/kg eV day) in proposed cryogenicdetectors operating at thresholds {similar_to}1 eV. Over this mass andenergy range, these rates are several orders of magnitude larger thanthose for direct detection of the corresponding particles coming fromthe halo. Since they orbit through the Earth's core, these Earth-boundWIMP's can be used to probe the temperature structure of the Earth'sinterior. The temperature of the Earth's inner core can be determinedto within 300 K, compared with the present 1000--2000 K uncertainty.</TEXT></DOC>
