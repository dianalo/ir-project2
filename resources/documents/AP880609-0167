Hastings of Miami, with a woman contradicting thetestimony of Dade County Mayor Steve Clark.   Florreyn Joyette Royals, a staff member of the Metro MiamiAction Plan, a civil rights organization, said Hastings did nottalk to Clark after a breakfast social meeting on Sept.6, 1985, asthe mayor had testified before the House Judiciary subcommittee oncriminal justice.   Clark told the subcommittee on May 26 that after Hastings hadmade a speech at the breakfast, the judge stepped off the stage,shook the mayor's hand and told him to stay away from Kevin``Waxy'' Gordon, against whom Hastings had approved an FBI wiretap.   FBI agents testified last week that Hastings had compromised thewiretap and caused them to close down three major corrputioninvestigtions in the Miami area.   Miss Royals told the subcommittee that she was assigned toescort Hastings to the meeting and back to his car after he hadspoken. She said Hastings had told her he needed to be in court by10:30 a.m. and for her to see to it that he finished his speech andwas on his way by 10:15 a.m.   ``I started tugging at his coat at 10:15 a.m.,'' said MissRoyals, who said she was stooping behind the judge as he made hisspeech to the organization. ``After his speech, he left. He wentback through the catering area and went and got his car. The onlyperson he talked to was our executive director (Lanny Sumptner) whohe shook hands with as he went out the front door of the hotel.   ``If he had shaken hands with Mayor Clark he would have had tojump over the podium and would have dragged me with him, because Iwas tugging on his coattails,'' said Miss Royals.   Miss Royals and the Rev. Bryan O. Walsh, a Catholic priest inthe Miami diocese, testified on behalf of Hastings as the judge'sonly witnesses before the subcommittee closed its public hearings.Walsh said he talked briefly with Hastings and Clark together priorto the breakfast meeting.   Hastings declined to testify before the subcommittee.   He said he believed the subcommittee would exonerate him of thecharges but that he is ``personally relieved and prepared to goforward if the articles of impeachment are approved against him.   ``I am legally correct, morally correct and spirituallysatisfied,'' said Hastings after the hearing.   Chairman John Conyers, D-Mich., said he would leave the recordopen until next Friday so that the defense could submit anydocuments or statements it wished to make.   Conyers declined to say when the subcommittee would make arecommendation to the House Judiciary Committee on whether Hastingsshould be impeached. If Hastings is impeached by the House, theSenate will conduct a trial to determine whether he should beremoved from office.   In addition to the charge that he compromised the threeinvestigations by leaking the fact that the FBI had a wiretap,Hastings also is accused of conspiring with Washington lawyerWilliam Borders to receive a bribe in exchange for modifying thesentences of two convicted racketeers.   Borders was convicted in 1982 of arranging a $150,000 bribe forHastings, was sentenced to five years in prison and was fined$35,000. In a separate trial, Hastings was acquitted of the briberyconspiracy charges.</TEXT></DOC>
