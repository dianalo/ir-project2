Karcher and 15 others with securities fraud in connection with alleged insider trading of the stock of Carl Karcher Enterprises Inc.    The suit, filed in federal court here, asserts that Mr. Karcher, the fast-food restaurant chain operator's chairman and founder, and his brother Donald F. Karcher, the company's president, gave information to other family members concerning an anticipated sharp drop in Karcher Enterprises' earnings before making that information public.    Those family members are alleged to have used that information to sell the company's stock before the price dropped on the announcement of the earnings. The SEC estimates the defendants either made profits or avoided losses totaling more than $310,000.    Carl Karcher yesterday called the charges &quot;totally false&quot; and &quot;highly offensive.&quot; He said he looks forward &quot;to going to trial and setting the record straight.&quot;    Don Smaltz, Donald Karcher's attorney, also vehemently denied any wrongdoing by his client. He said he has thoroughly reviewed the SEC's case and found &quot;there isn't a shred of evidence&quot; to support charges of securities-law violations.    Neither Carl nor Donald Karcher is charged with selling any stock themselves or with getting money from any of the alleged violations.    The Anaheim, Calif.-based company issued a statement saying it isn't a defendant in the case and doesn't expect the matter to have any effect on operations. It said it is &quot;fully satisfied&quot; that the charges &quot;are completely without merit.&quot; The company's stock closed yesterday in national over-the-counter trading at $15.50 a share, down 87.5 cents.    The allegations center on an announcement the company made Oct. 23, 1984, that earnings for the quarter ending Nov. 2 could be as much as 50% lower than a year earlier because of weaker-than-expected sales. According to the SEC suit, Karcher Enterprises stock opened that day at $21.50 a share and fell as low as $16.50 after the announcement before closing at $17.25.    The SEC is seeking civil penalties of about $2 million as well as permanent injunctions against future violations by the defendants and the return of money allegedly made from the transactions.    Carl N. Karcher has attracted attention in Southern California for his conservative politics and contributions to conservative causes. He also appears on his company's television commercials, leading one local reporter to dub him the &quot;fast-food Lee Iacocca.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
