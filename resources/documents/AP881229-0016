DALE NELSON</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   President Reagan's decision to extend U.S.territorial waters an additional nine miles offshore will make itmore difficult for foreign countries to spy on American shores,administration officials say.   Reagan took the action Wednesday at the Bel Air home where hewill live after Jan. 20. He and first lady Nancy Reagan are spendingthe holidays there, but were leaving today for three days in PalmSprings.   By a proclamation, the president extended U.S. ``sovereignty andjurisdiction'' from the present three miles to 12 miles.   Maureen Walker, a foreign affairs officer in the StateDepartment's Office of Ocean Law and Policy, said the extensionmakes the United States the 105th country to claim a 12-mile limit.   The 12-mile limit was called for in 1982 by the United NationsConvention on the Law of the Sea, and the U.S. action leaves onlysix countries claiming narrower bands of offshore water. Finland andNorway claim four miles each, and the Dominican Republic, Greece,Israel and Turkey each claim six miles, Ms. Walker said.   ``It will make foreign intelligence-gathering more difficult andless effective because foreign ships will no longer be able tostation themselves off our shores within the 12-mile limit,'' theState Department officer said.   The proclamation assures foreign ships the right of ``innocentpassage'' through U.S. territorial waters and the right to passthrough straits.   Ms. Walker said it would not affect U.S. and state laws thatgovern offshore mineral and fishing rights.   It applies to the waters off the United States, Puerto Rico,Guam, American Samoa, the U.S. Virgin Islands, the Northern Marianaislands and any other territory over which the United Statesexercises sovereignty. It applies to airspace over the ocean, aswell as the waters and the bed and subsoil of the ocean.   In another action, the president extended for six months thestate of emergency that he proclaimed in 1986 between the UnitedStates and Libya. The step was needed to continue in effect thepresident's 1986 order blocking Libyan assets in the United Statesin retaliation for alleged terrorist action.   The president also signed a seven-page executive orderimplementing the 1,100-page trade act passed by the last Congress.White House deputy press secretary Leslye Arsht said the order willenable the United States ``to continue effectively to work for moreopen world markets and strengthened international institutions.''   Ms. Arsht said the president's national security adviser, Lt.Gen. Colin L. Powell, telephoned him at the Bel Air home to informhim of the announcement by the British Department of Transport thatlast week's crash of Pan American Flight 103 in Scotland was causedby a bomb.   ``The investigation will continue to determine how the explosiveswere introduced into the plane,'' she said. ``The FBI and the FAAare working closely with the British and Scottish authorities on theinvestigation. We are determined to find out who did it, using allavailable resources.''</TEXT></DOC>
