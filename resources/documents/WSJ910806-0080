Indeed, the Journal of the AmericanMedical Association, claiming that reform has now taken on anaura of &quot;inevitability,&quot; recently devoted an entire issue to15 proposals from physician groups, health policy analysts,think tanks, employer coalitions and legislators. Regardlessof this new apparent urgency, many proposed plans are moreself-interested than they seem. You can tell quite a lotabout each plan simply by understanding the financialinterests of the group that supports it.   -- Proposals offered by physicians almost always emphasizeretaining &quot;fee for service&quot; methods of payment, taxpayersubsidies for insurance premiums, and establishing limits onmalpractice awards and higher physician reimbursement forMedicaid patients. Such provisions and &quot;reforms&quot; make iteasier for physicians to collect their fees, select the mostup-to-date (and costly) services, then pass the expenses toinsurers and taxpayers. Physicians' proposals also favor&quot;community&quot; rating of insurance premiums, in which allmembers of a local region pay the same premium, and face noexclusions of coverage for pre-existing conditions.</LP><TEXT>   -- Insurance firms fear large claims from riskieremployees or occupations, and would rather &quot;experience rate&quot;subscribers to weed out high risks. Health insurers feelingpressure to extend affordable coverage to small groups andthe uninsured stress reinsurance and taxpayer-financed riskpools to eliminate high risk people from their insuranceplans.   -- Hospital groups emphasize explicit mechanisms toprovide reimbursement for &quot;uncompensated services.&quot;   -- Federal government analysts, with their extravagantfaith in solutions that require a sizable bureaucracy,emphasize expansion of Medicare price controls on hospitalsand on physicians, despite the perverse incentives andcost-shifting that such controls create.   -- Employer groups seek to limit annual premium increasesand/or health cost increases through regulation of insurancefirms, or flat fees for medical services per employee. Largeemployers are increasingly supporting legislation requiringsmall firms to provide benefits, to contain &quot;cost shifting&quot;from uninsured to insured patients. Small firms emphasizeinsurance reform to make small group policies affordable.   Taken together, the various proposals add up to less thanwhat is required to achieve an efficient health market. Manyare at odds with each other, since lower costs for one groupresult in lower revenues for another. Any workable systemmust accommodate many divergent interests. But above all itmust restructure incentives for both consumers and providersso that robust market forces can work.   The Heritage Foundation, for example, correctly seeks toimprove the efficiency and fairness of the federal taxsubsidy for health insurance purchases. The proposal of AlainEnthoven and Richard Kronick, in particular, pays moreattention than most to the critical issue of introducingcompetition and incentives into the complex subsidy-riddeninsurance and health services markets. Their proposal,summarized along with the rest in the recent JAMA issue,deftly integrates government intervention with marketincentives to produce a workable reform for the 1990s.   If we fear centralized direction of the health system, aswell we should, there are a few signposts to watch for inhealth proposals to determine whether they will introducemore robust competition in markets for both health servicesand insurance:   First of all, first-dollar coverage of health expendituresand tax subsidies of insurance premiums, which bluntcompetitive forces, must be curtailed. Just as important areenhancements in the abilities of individuals, firms or partlypublic sponsors to exert consumer sovereignty in the medicaland insurance markets. Early attention to defining aconsumers guide to &quot;basic&quot; health services and insuranceplans will go a long way to permitting consumers to maketheir choices count in the marketplace.   Too much attention has lately been focused on somehowmaking it easier for more people to gain access to medicalservices, at someone else's expense, rather than on usingmarket forces to make those services more affordable for themany. The deadly paradox of excess and deprivation (eithertoo easy access to seemingly &quot;free&quot; services, or no access atall) threatens to unravel the system for everyone.   If suppliers of health services really want to escape theheavy hand of regulation, they must bear some of thefinancial risk of their offerings, whether in the hospital orin physician offices or insurance company boardrooms. Make nomistake, however. Cost containment for consumers, whetherachieved by healthy competition or unhealthy controls, istantamount to revenue containment for providers. No interestgroup in history has ever preferred competition to subsidies.And the latter are invariably marketed as a &quot;reform.&quot;   ---   Mr. Weinschrott is a research fellow at Hudson Institutein Indianapolis.</TEXT></DOC>
