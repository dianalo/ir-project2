Barco told a national television audience Thursday night thatthe talks should conclude with the dissolution of guerrillaorganizations.   Guerrillas must stop their terrorist acts, human rightsviolations, kidnappings and extortions before talks begin, Barcosaid. He said a peace agreement should be reached by March 1990,when the next presidential and parliamentary elections arescheduled.   The offer came two days after guerrillas firing automaticassault rifles, throwing hand grenades and setting fire to houseskilled 12 peasants, Gov. Jose Gabriel Amin of Cordoba state said.   An estimated 30 guerrillas of the People's Liberation Army setfire to a ranch, killed 10 peasants and wounded 15 Tuesday near thetown of Canalete, Amin said Thursday.   Canalete is about 320 miles north of Bogota.   The insurgents then attacked the nearby village of El Tomate,setting fire to 26 huts and killing two people, the governor saidin a broadcast interview with the Colombian radio chain RCN.   In El Tomate, a village of 600 people, the attackers leftmessages painted on walls declaring, ``Death to the toads andparamilitaries,'' survivors said in interviews with RCN.   Guerrillas call army informants toads.   Peasants in Colombia have long claimed that they are caughtbetween the army and the guerrillas.   In dozens of interviews with The Associated Press, peasants havetold of being forced to sell food and other necessities toguerrillas.   Often soldiers force the peasants to give information aboutguerrilla movements, the peasants say. The guerrillas then returnand kill the peasants, accusing them of being army informants, thepeasants have said.
