 Micro FocusCobol/2, an SAA Cobol product for the OS/2 environment, and the compilerincluded in Micro Focus Cobol/2 Workbench, implement the SAA CommonProgramming Interface definition of Cobol.andP;  The new products run on eitherOS/2 or MS-DOS on the PS/2, XT or the AT.andP;  The Cobol/2 Workbench family issaid to offer complementary functionality with AD/Cycle CODE/370 and softwareconfiguration and Library Manager support.andP;  Prototyping, development, andexecution of user interfaces is provided by the HIMS in the Dialog System,and the Micro Focus Animator provides visual debugging.andP;  There is hostemulation with the CICS and IMS options, and 370 Assembler products, and thisthis support enables transparent access to mainframe data and code.andP;  TheDialog System is available November 1, and AD/Cycle Integration Features onCobol/2 ships May 29, 1992.andM;CSP/Application Development EnablerandM;CSP/Application Development Enabler Programmable Workstation is published andlicensed by K-C Computer Services Inc, and as usual, marketed by the IBMCo-operative Software Program.andP;  It is an AD/Cycle tool set designed to workwith CSP/ADE and consists of two components.andP;  CSP/ADE PWS Application Modelsare a set of re-usable, pre-coded applications that support one-to-one,one-to-many, and many-to-many entity relationships.andP;  The CSP/ADE PWSDevelopment Functions are a set of pre-compiled subroutines that provideprogrammers with capabilities like string and data manipulation, and editing.andO;CSP/ADE PWS can import a CSP/ADE Application Model into a CSP/ADE PWS MemberSpecification Library and once testing is complete, the application will beexported in external source format to the host machine and checked into theproject using CSP/ADE's Enabling toolset.andP;  CSP/ADE PWS runs on the PS/2 andwill be available December 27, 1991.andM;KnowledgeWare ADW for AD/CycleandM;KnowledgeWare Inc's ADW family of software engineering products are thecompany's latest input to the AD/Cycle framework, and the two new productsare the Application Development Workbench/RAD Workstation and ApplicationDevelopment Workbench/Documentation Workstation.andP;  The first offers iterativeprototyping, object-oriented screen definition and the generation ofapplication design objects, while the ADW/DOC Workstation creates and managesdocumentation for ADW-based projects.andP;  KnowledgeWare is also announcing newreleases of its ADW family that incorporate new functions for integrationwith AD/Cycle.andP;  The ADW Workstation products run on the PS/2 under OS/2 whileADW/MVS and ADW/REF run on a System/370 processor under MVS TSO/E.andP;  ADW/RAD1.6.02 and ADW/DOC 1.6.02 will be available September 20, December 27 forADW/MVS 1.5.02 and February 14, 1992 for ADW/MVS 1.6.02.andP;  Release 2.7.01 ofADW/Planning, Analysis, Design, RAD and DOC Workstations, ADW/Cross SystemProduct Enablement Facility and ADW/Repository Enablement Facility ship March27, June 26 for ADW/MVS 2.7.01, while ADW/RAD and ADW/DOC 1.6.01 are out.andM;Intersolv Products for AD/CycleandM;Intersolv Inc is a member of the IBM International Alliance for the AD/Cycleframework and the products being announced are part of the ExceleratorSeries, Design Recovery Series and and the PVCS Series for ConfigurationManagement.andP;  The Excelerator Series provides life-cycle support, fromplanning to coding, and there are capabilities to design, analyse, documentor redevelop existing systems.andP;  The Excelerator Series is based onIntersolv's local network repository, information model, user interface andunderlying set of facilities.andP;  They are said to offer a direct, two-wayexchange of data with Repository Manager/MVS using the LAN RepositoryGateway.andP;  LAN Library support for AD/Cycle is available with selected PVCSSeries in conjunction with SAA AD/Cycle WorkStation Platform/2.andP;  The PVCSproducts are PVCS Version Manager 4.0, Configuration Builder 4.0, WorkStationPlatform/2 Interface and LAN Library Gateway.andP;  PVCS Version Manager 4.0provides software version control and PVCS Configuration Builder 4.0 providesconfiguration management software.andP;  The WorkStation Platform/2 Interface issaid to provide distributed configuration management across multipleenvironments, while the LAN Library Gateway provides a gateway to AD/Cyclelibrary management facilities.andP;  Excelerator Series and the Design RecoverySeries run on the PS/2 under OS/2 and are used for the design of softwarethat will run under MVS, OS/2 or other systems.andP;  Supported local areanetworks include LAN Server and Novell Inc's NetWare 386 and NetWare 286.andO;Token-Ring and Ethernet topologies are supported.andP;  The Excelerator Series,LAN Repository Gateway, Design Recovery and PVCS LAN Library Gateway productswill be available March 27, 1992, while the PVCS WorkStation Platform/2Interface, PVCS Configuration Builder 4.0, and PVCS Version Manager 4.0shipped on September 20 this year.andM;VS Fortran Version 2 Release 5 AdditionsandM;VS Fortran Version 2 Release 5.0 now enables users to address larger dataareas via a new function called Extended Common by placing these blocks inESA Data Spaces.andP;  Extended Common enables each dynamically allocated commonblock to be as large as 2Gb, and support for this function in MVS/ESA isavailable now.andP;  VS Fortran Version 2.5.0 is designed to provide VirtualStorage Constraint Relief when running under MVS/XA, MVS/ESA or running in anXA virtual machine under VM/XA, VM/ESA 1.0 or 1.1 or in an XC virtual machineunder VM/ESA 1.1 by enabling the compiler to reside above the 16Mb line andexecute in 31-bit addressing mode.andM;APL2, APL2 Application Environment Version 2 Release 1andM;APL2 Version 2 supports co-operative processing among TCP/IP-connected MVSand VM systems, and it can access non-APL network applications, distributedata via access to new releases of SQL/DS and DB2 and access MVS/ESA datawindows.andP;  Also, it supports additional interlanguage communicationfacilities, including calls to and from APL2 functions from C/370, OS PL/Iand REXX TSO/E.andP;  Compatibility with APL2 products on PC-DOS and AIX/6000systems includes common full-screen and APL file access.andP;  Release 1 will beavailable March 27 1992.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
