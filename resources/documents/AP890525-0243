Lindner told shareholders Wednesday that Penn Central has plentyof cash to finance a major acquisition.   ``Penn Central continues to have great financial resources,'' hesaid. ``We have over $1.8 billion in shareholders' equity.''   The Cincinnati-based telecommunications and defense firm is 31percent owned by Lindner's American Financial Corp.   Lindner clearly spelled out the company's intentions at lastyear's annual meeting, but also said at the time that he was in nohurry to make a deal.   ``Last year I said there was no sense of urgency to make anymove,'' he said. ``That is still true today.''   Although shareholders' equity is approaching $2 billion, thecompany's debt is only $220 million.   At the end of 1988, Penn Central had cash, temporary investmentsand marketable securities of $1.16 billion.   The company has $1.3 billion in net operating losscarryforwards, which are past losses that can offset future incometo reduce taxes. Acquisitions could produce higher earnings andhelp maximize the benefits of the carryforwards.   ``Penn Central is capable of doing a $5 billion or $6 billiontransaction, especially if Henry Kravis (of leveraged buyout firmKohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co.) can do a $25 billion RJR Nabiscodeal with only $1 billion,'' said Lindner.</TEXT></DOC>
