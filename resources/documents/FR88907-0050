This section directedeach State to submit, to the Administrator of USEPA, a list of the attainmentstatus for all areas within the State. The Administrator was required topromulgate the State lists, with any necessary modifications. The Administratorpublished these lists in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on March 3, 1978 (43 FR 8962), and made necessaryamendments in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on October 5, 1978 (43 FR 45993). These areadesignations are subject to revision whenever sufficient data become availableto warrant a redesignation.The primary TSP NAAQS was violated when, in a year, either: (1) The geometricmean value of TSP concentrations exceeded 75 mircograms per cubic meterof air (75 ug/m\3\) (the annual primary standard; or (2) the 24-hour concentrationof TSP exceeded 260 ug/m\3\ more than once (the 24-hour standard). Thesecondary TSP NAAQS was violated when, in a year, the 24-hour concentrationexceeded 150 ug/m\3\ more than once.USEPA revised the particulate matter standard on July 1, 1987, (52 FR 24634)and eliminated the TSP ambient air quality standard. The revised standardis expressed in terms of particular matter with nominal diameter of 10mircrometers or less (PM<T2>10</T2>). However, USEPA will continue to process redesignations ofareas from nonattainment to attainment or unclassifiable for TSP in keepingwith past policy because various regulatory provisions such as new sourcereview and prevention of significant deterioration are keyed to the attainmentstatus of areas. The July 1, 1987, notice (p. 24682), column 1) describesUSEPA's transition policy regarding TSP redesignations.USEPA's criteria for supportable redesignation requests, as they pertainto TSP, are discussed most recently in the following memorandum:andbullet; September 30, 1985, from Gerald Emison, Director, Office of AirQuality Planning and Standards (OAQPS), to the Regional Air Division Directorsentitled ``Total Suspended Particulate (TSP) Redesignations.''USEPA's criteria relevant to TSP redesignations are summarized as follows:andbullet; Eight consecutive quarters of the most recent, quality assuredambient air quality data must indicate no violation of the TSP NAAQS. Themonitors must be placed at points of expected maximum TSP impact, and themonitoring network must be extensive enough to produce fully representativedata. If monitoring data are not representative, dispersion modeling mustbe used to determine the impact of a source.andbullet; Improvements in air quality must be attributable to federallyenforceable and permanent emission reductions from a fully approved andimplemented SIP control strategy. An exception to the requirement for afully approved and implemented SIP control strategy can be made if thephysical circumstances and long-term economic factors are such that theapproved and implemented measures have the same weight as a fully approvedSIP control strategy for the purpose of demonstrating attainment. For example,the permanent closing of the major emitting sources, road paving to eliminatefugitive emissions, or other irreversible actions can be such measures.andbullet; Emission reductions and the resultant impact on air quality cannotbe temporary or the result of an economic downturn. It must be highly unlikelythat emission rates will increase at units operating below their allowableemission rates or that any increase will result in a violation of the NAAQS.andbullet; Dispersion techniques cannot be responsible for the improvementin air quality. Sources in the nonattainment area must be reviewed forconsistency with the requirements of USEPA's July 8, 1985 (50 FR 27892),revised stack height regulations.On October 5, 1978 (43 FR 46013) Montgomery County was designated as follows:<ITAG tagnum="84">Primary Nonattainment</ITAG>The Cities of Miamisburg and Dayton excluding that portion of Dayton boundedby Patterson Rd., Spaulding Rd., Woodbine Ave., and Smithville Road.<ITAG tagnum="84">Secondary Nonattainment  </ITAG>That area in Montgomery County south and east of the following: Rte. 440(U.S. 40) at the Montgomery-Miami County line south to Bridgewater Rd.,south to Taylorville Rd., west of Little York Rd., west to Peters Rd.,south of Frederick Rd., northwest to Dog Leg Rd., southwest to WestbrookRd., west to Olive Rd., south to Shiloh Springs Rd., west to Union Rd.,south to Little Richmond Rd., west to Snyder Rd., south to Old Dayton Rd.,west to Luther's Church Rd., South to Mile Rd., West to Guntle Rd., southHavermale Rd., west to Clayton Rd., south to Chicken Birshle Rd., westto Montgomery-Preble county line. However, there is an <T3>attainment </T3>area within this nonattainment area which is describedby the following boundaries: north on S.R. 48 from the Montgomery-Warrencounty line to Whipp Road, east to Bigger Road, north to Wilmington Pike,northwest to Woodman Dr., north to Vale Dr., east to County Line Rd., northto Patterson Rd., west to Spaulding Rd., north to Woodbine Ave., west toSmithville Rd., south to Dorothy La., west to South Dixie Dr., southwestto I-75, south to the Montgomery-Warren county line.  Attainment  Remainder of County  On February 26, 1987, the State of Ohio requested that USEPA redesignateMontgomery County to attainment except for the City of Moraine which shouldremain secondary nonattainment.  To support is request that the primary and secondary nonattainment areasbe redesignated to attainment, the State submitted (1) data collected atthe 12 monitoring sites in the county for the period 1984-1986, (2) a listof emission reductions due to the installation of air pollution controlequipment and permanent plant shutdowns, and (3) a discussion of stackheight dispersion techniques. (The last cannot be credited for evaluatingthis redesignation.) USEPA supplemented these data with, among other things,monitoring data from its Storage and Retrieval of Aerometric Data (SAROAD)from 1976 to 1986.  <ITAG tagnum="84">USEPA's Evaluation of Technical Support Data  </ITAG>USEPA has reviewed the technical support data submitted by the State andhas determined that the redesignation is not acceptable primarily due toinsufficient federally enforceable emission reductions. In addition, themonitoring network is inadequate in two areas and, where monitoring dataare not available, the State must justify why they consider the area attainmentgiven the absence of monitoring data. Each of these issues and the implicationsof the stack height regulations is discussed below.  Emission Reductions  The State has cited 17 facilities in Montgomery County which had eithershutdown or installed air pollution control equipment. For the facilitiesthat have been shutdown, Ohio did not submit evidence that these shutdownsare permanent and federally enforceable. This evidence should be in theform of documentation showing that if these sources were to start-up whythey must be treated as new sources under Ohio's new source review permittingrequirements. For the facilities that have installed air pollution controlequipment, Ohio did not verify to USEPA that all the installed air pollutioncontrol equipment are federally enforceable, i.e., part of the SIP. Ohiomust verify that the SIP has been fully implemented, in order for USEPAto be able to redesignate the area.  While actual emissions have decreased significantly in Montgomery County,Ohio only cites a few federally enforceable reductions. Because many sourcesare currently operating at levels below those allowed by the SIP, Ohiomust demonstrate that air quality would be maintained if such sources wereto increase emissions to allowed levels. This is especially important inthe Miamisburg area for which Ohio failed to cite any emission reductions,yet requested a redesignation from primary nonattainment to attainment. To summarize this section, Ohio must provide sufficient federally enforceableemission reductions coupled with a fully implemented SIP to support thisredesignation. If reductions in emissions due to the implementation ofOhio's fugitive dust regulations have caused the improvement in air quality,then Ohio must obtain federal approval of their fugitive dust regulationsbefore Montgomery County can be redesignated, or the reductions must beotherwise demonstrated to be permanent.  Monitoring Network  The monitoring network is acceptable for the entire primary and secondarynonattainment area that the State is requesting be redesignated exceptfor Valley street in Dayton (which is discussed in the following section)and for the areas north of the Cities of Dayton and Miamisburg. For theseareas no monitors are located near the major sources. North of Dayton arelocated the Cargill Corn Mill Plant (157 tons per year (TPY) allowable)and the Montgomery County North Reduction Plant (incinerator, 100 TPY 1983actual emissions). North of Miamisburg are located Ohio Briquetting (101TPY allowable) and several other smaller sources. For USEPA to redesignatethese areas the State must provide modeling, following USEPA guidelines,to demonstrate attainment in these areas.  Monitoring Data  For the most recent eight quarters of air quality monitoring data, therehave been no violations of either the primary or secondary TSP NAAQS atthe nine monitoring sites currently operating the the County. However,monitor 361660015 (Valley Street, Dayton) was shutdown in 1982 after recordingviolations of the primary NAAQS from 1976-1981. Thus, two years of violation-freedata are not available at this site. The State must specifically discussthe reason it considers this area attainment given the absence of monitoringdata in order for USEPA to be able to redesignate the area.  Stack Height Regulations  USEPA assessed the impact of the stack height dispersion techniques onthe redesignation request. It was determined that the improvements in airquality were not inconsistent with the stack height regulations.  <ITAG tagnum="84">Proposed Action  </ITAG>andbullet; Disapproval of the State's February 26, 1987, redesignation requestfor Montgomery county.  If the State provides the additional technical support discussed abovefor Montgomery County during the public comment period, and USEPA determinesthat it is acceptable, then USEPA will withdraw its notice of proposeddisapproval and propose to approve the designation. If, however, the Statedoes not provide the additional data, or if it is not acceptable, thenUSEPA will take final action to disapprove the redesignation request. All intersted parties are invited to submit comments on this proposed actionnotice. USEPA will consider all comments received within 30 days of publicationof this notice.  The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this rule from the requirementsof section 3 of Executive Order 12291.  Under 5 U.S.C. section 605(b), the Administrator has certified that redesignationsdo not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of smallentities.
