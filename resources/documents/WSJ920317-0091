Although you arecorrect in stating that our November 1988 petition to the FDAto ban silicone-gel breast implants has helped to place thisissue in the spotlight, that petition and all subsequentinformation we have forwarded to the FDA in support of a banwere based on hard science, including a large number ofpeer-reviewed studies.   As an example of such studies, one of the mostwell-documented problems caused by silicone-gel breastimplants is interference with mammography, leading to delayeddiagnosis of breast cancer, attended with lower chance for acure. Interestingly, human studies with alternative implants,filled with absorbable, metabolizable vegetable oil that doesnot interfere with mammography, have been delayed becausecompanies such as Dow would not support such research, solong as they can keep selling silicone-gel implants.</LP><TEXT>   Second, in the closest thing to a randomized study oncomplications of breast implants, a market-research study of100,000 American households, funded by the plastic surgeons,found an alarming incidence of serious complications in the500 women who had implants. Projected nationally to all womenwith implants, which is scientifically permissible since,according to the surgeons, &quot;the resulting data were balancedfor respondent age, income and region to assure that theresults are representative of the national population ofwomen with implants,&quot; there are about 155,000 women withcomplications such as rupture, leak or infection, out of thetwo million with implants. The study also found that mostwomen were quite satisfied with the results of theimplantation.   As far as your claim that we use internal companymemorandums in pushing the FDA toward a ban, the &quot;conspiracy&quot;you allege between us and trial lawyers must be weak for wehave never seen any of these internal memos, much lesssubmitted them to the FDA.   The litigation &quot;kits&quot; we provide for $750 are, in fact,about 4,000 pages of documents on silicone, mainly publishedstudies from peer-reviewed journals and, in the future,documents we purchased from Dow will be added. The cost iscommensurate with copying and mailing costs, and staff timeto obtain and evaluate the documents.   Sidney M.
