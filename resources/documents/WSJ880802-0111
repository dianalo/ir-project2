Union members at a General Electric Co. plant in Lynn, Mass., plan a suit challenging the loss of a jetplane contract to Pratt andamp; Whitney Inc. And San Diego attorney William Lerach says he is on the verge of filing a shareholder suit against one of the major defense companies named in the investigation, but he won't say which one.    Legal specialists predict a variety of litigation, based on civil charges of securities fraud, racketeering, unfair trade practices, unjust enrichment and, possibly, antitrust violations. A barrage of shareholder class actions also is expected if defense-industry stock prices are hurt by the inquiry.    Much of this legal action will occur long before criminal or administrative charges are filed against a single defense company. &quot;When there's a high-visibility matter, there's a race to the courthouse to get there before someone else does,&quot;says Bud Holman, a New York attorney who represented Union Carbide Corp. after the 1984 accident at its plant in Bhopal, India.    In the unfolding Pentagon scandal, the union members at GE's Lynn plant may be the first to get to the courthouse. Still smoldering over the loss of 600 jobs when the Pentagon handed a chunk of the contract for the F-404 engine to rival Pratt andamp; Whitney, the workers have retained a Boston law firm to draft a lawsuit against Pratt andamp; Whitney's parent, United Technologies Corp., one of the major contractors under investigation.    Dennis Daly, a union official, alleges that Pratt andamp; Whitney may have won its contract through bribery or gaining inside information on the bidding process. The union's suit, which its lawyer says will be prepared in a few weeks, will probably accuse United Technologies and Pratt andamp; Whitney of violating racketeering laws. A spokesman for United Technologies says, &quot;We aren't prepared to comment because we haven't seen any litigation.&quot;    Under provisions of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, or RICO, any damages won are tripled. Civil RICO suits have become increasingly popular vehicles for pursuing corporate wrongdoing. Mr. Robinson recently helped win a $69 million verdict in a civil RICO case against Ashland Oil Inc. involving foreign bribes.    But large civil RICO awards are still rare. A more common avenue of civil litigation in the defense investigation probably will be shareholder litigation. Mr. Lerach's New York-based law firm of Milberg Weiss Bershad Specthrie andamp; Lerach is a pioneer in shareholder derivative lawsuits, which are brought by individual shareholders against a company's directors on behalf of the company itself.    Mr. Lerach says it isn't necessary to wait for criminal or administrative penalties against defense companies or for stock prices to drop in order to prove that shareholders have been harmed by the scandal. &quot;There have already been dire consequences,&quot; he says. &quot;There have been egregious violations of the law. Corporate boards have not carried out their fiduciary duties or fundamental obligation to comply with the law.&quot;    One of Mr. Lerach's competitors, Richard Greenfield, a specialist in securities class actions, has also been retained to monitor the investigation for three clients who are hoping to pursue shareholder lawsuits against Northrop Corp., Unisys Corp. and General Dynamics Corp. But Mr. Greenfield believes it is too early to file what he calls &quot;a responsible suit.&quot; He says he is waiting &quot;for the other shoe to drop in the investigation&quot; before proceeding with litigation. Grumman Corp., the big loser to McDonnell Douglas Corp. on the Pentagon's $40 billion Advanced Tactical Aircraft contract, is taking a wait-and-see attitude, too. The ATA is one of 85 defense contracts being reviewed by federal investigators for potential bid-rigging. According to Grumman spokeswoman Miriam Reed, the aerospace concern hasn't retained counsel and hasn't any plans to pursue a suit against McDonnell or the Pentagon. &quot;We must be careful and cautious,&quot; Ms. Reed says. &quot;There have been allegations, but no proof of wrongdoing.&quot;    Other disappointed bidders who lost contracts because of suspected bribery or bid-rigging are likely to seek legal redress. But they will be more inclined to file administrative bid protests against the Pentagon, which could result in the nullification of tainted contracts, legal specialists say.    Mr. Greenfield says the cozy nature of the defense establishment and the desire to avoid a lengthy discovery process will discourage defeated bidders from filing lawsuits against their rivals. &quot;They don't want their dirty laundry hanging out there. They all have something to hide,&quot; he says.    The squads of criminal defense lawyers monitoring the investigation for clients mentioned in the Pentagon scandal are watching the developments with keen interest. &quot;Civil litigation is always a concern in big white-collar cases,&quot; says a Washington, D.C., lawyer whose firm is representing three defense companies that are being investigated. &quot;At the point in time when any company is thinking of entering a guilty plea, you always have to ask what the implications are on the civil side.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
