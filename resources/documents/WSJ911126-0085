The 86-8 vote, in which the House has yet to concur,represented a significant compromise from an original plan touse $1 billion out of the defense budget to help the fiscallystrapped Kremlin. That proposal died amidst a growing tide ofsentiment against foreign aid and mounting fears thatsenators who voted for the plan would be smeared in politicalcampaigns for sending U.S. funds to a former enemy.</LP><TEXT>   But the aid idea was revived when a group of well-regardedlawmakers, including Sen. Sam Nunn (D., Ga.), Sen. DavidBoren (D., Okla.) and Sen. Richard Lugar (R., Ind.), joinedforces to resurrect it and won pledges from prominentlawmakers that the issue won't be used as campaign fodderagainst those who voted in favor of it.   Lawmakers who pushed the plan argued that there ismounting uncertainty about who will control the massiveSoviet nuclear arsenal as the former Soviet Uniondisintegrates. They maintained that it is important to theU.S. to help destroy as much of that arsenal as possible,under the terms of recently completed arms controlagreements, while there is still a chance to do so.   The action on Soviet aid came on legislation to implementthe Conventional Forces in Europe treaty, under which theWestern allies and nations of the former Soviet bloc agree tocut their conventional forces in Europe. The Senate ratifiedthat treaty by a 90-4 vote.   Some lawmakers had been reluctant to approve that pactbecause of uncertainty that the Soviet central governmentwill be in a position to carry it out. But administrationofficials argued that it is important to have a formallyapproved treaty in hand if the West is to convince breakawaySoviet republics to abide by the reduced levels of militaryforces across Europe envisioned by its terms.   At the same time it dealt with the arms pact anddestruction of Soviet weaponry, the Senate took a stepdesigned to head off short-term instability in thedisintegrating Soviet Union. It approved, 87-7, an amendmentsponsored by Sen. Boren to allow President Bush to use asmuch as $200 million in defense funds to fly emergency foodshipments to the Soviet Union and its republics this winter.   Sen. Boren said in an interview that the amendment, whichextends and expands existing authority to use U.S. planes foremergency aid, is designed to give Mr. Bush the power torespond quickly if potentially destabilizing food shortagesdevelop while Congress is on recess and unable to give rapidapproval.   &quot;This deals with what could be the emergency situationwhile we are not in session,&quot; said Sen. Boren, chairman ofthe Senate Intelligence Committee. He added that U.S.intelligence analysts and Soviet observers alike worry thatthere could be &quot;instability resulting from a breakdown offood distribution&quot; that could create political unrest in theSoviet Union and its republics this winter. &quot;Our intelligenceanalysts indicate the risk is not unsubstantial,&quot; he said.   The Senate action follows a decision by President Bushlast week to grant the Soviets a $1.5 billion package ofhumanitarian assistance, consisting largely of credits to buyU.S. grain, to meet immediate food needs.   The White House lauded the Senate vote on the CFE treaty,calling the measure &quot;the cornerstone of the new securitystructure we have been working to construct in Europe.&quot; Andit moved quickly to maintain momentum on arms control bysending lawmakers the long-awaited Strategic Arms ReductionTreaty.   The treaty between the U.S. and the Soviet Union, whichtook nine years to negotiate, would reduce strategic nuclearweapons on both sides by roughly one-third. While the treatyhas wide support, some lawmakers also question whether it,along with the CFE agreement, should be ratified because ofuncertainty about the ability of the Soviet centralgovernment to carry out its terms.</TEXT></DOC>
