They are required elements of a quality assurance (QA)program. Inspection, focused on hardware, verifies that equipment meetsits specified requirements. Auditing, focused on documentation, verifies,through objective evidence, that the QA program is being effectivelyimplemented. Quality surveillance, focused on performance, verifies effectiveuse of the plant's procedures and quality program. The surveillance conceptprovides a method to assure that the gap between the inspection functionand the audit function is filled in.</TEXT></DOC>
