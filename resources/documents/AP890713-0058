Bill Clements, who will sign it, a spokeswoman says.   ``At the direction of the governor, our staff worked withsponsors of the bill to make sure the problem was straightenedout,'' said Rossanna Salazar, deputy gubernatorial press secretary.   The repeal was approved by the House with a 134-0 vote after itwas amended to protect certain crime victims from being contacted bycompanies soliciting business, such as those selling home securitysystems.   The Senate concurred with the amendment, 27-0, and sent the billto Clements.   News organizations decried the confidentiality law after severallaw enforcement agencies began withholding information theypreviously had made public.   The law was passed during the regular session that ended May 29.   Some agencies withheld information on missing children andaccident victims, said San Antonio Light Publisher George Irish intestimony this week to a House committee. Irish represented TexasMedia, a first amendment and freedom-of-information coalition ofseven news organizations, in urging repeal.   Rep. Fred Blair, who sponsored the confidentiality law and thebill repealing it, said the original measure ``was being broadlyapplied to accident victims, DWIs, missing children _ all the kindsof things that we want to provide information on.''   ``So we repealed it, and we're going to take a look at it in thefuture,'' said Blair.   Blair said the bill sent to the governor accomplishes ``abouthalf'' of what he wants in order to protect crime victims, but thathe wanted ``an ample opportunity for full discussion'' beforeattempting further changes.   The bill, in addition to the repeal, would prohibit using crimevictim information obtained from law enforcement agencies to solicitbusiness from the victim or a family member of the victim.   The prohibition would apply to victims who were injured in acrime or whose home was illegally entered.   The bill would give the attorney general power to sue under theDeceptive Trade Practices Act to stop such use of the information.Violation of the law would be punishable by civil penalties up to$10,000 plus court costs and attorney's fees.   The repeal would be immediate, and the solicitation section wouldtake effect Jan. 1.</TEXT></DOC>
