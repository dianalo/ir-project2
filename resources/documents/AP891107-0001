He accused the military anddemanded that those responsible be handed over for prosecution.   Spokesman Julio Flores of the Social Christian Popular Movementsaid that because of recent attacks, ``our leaders have ordered allparty installations closed. ... The authorities are threatening us,they do not let us operate.''   Flores told The Associated Press in a telephone interview thatCecilio Rivera, the movement's coordinator in western Sonsonateprovince, was kidnapped on Monday with two other party members.   He said their bodies, showing signs of torture andbullet-riddled, were found on the outskirts of Sonsonate city, theprovincial capital 40 miles west of San Salvador, on Tuesday evening.   Local judicial authorities ordered the three bodies buried asunidentified cadavers, but party members were able to identify them,Flores said.   He said Rivera's age and the names and ages of the other two werenot available immediately.   ``Our comrades were seized by military officials dressed incivilian clothes after a meeting at the party hall (in Sonsonate),''Flores said, adding that they were killed ``in death-squad style''and a hand-printed sign was found next to the bodies saying they had``betrayed the fatherland.''   ``We hold those military officials dressed in civilian clothesresponsible and we ask that the Sonsonate commander turn them overto judicial authorities,'' Flores said.   The commander is Col. Juan Armando Rodriguez.   Juan Jose Martel, a member of the party's national executive,told reporters: ``We do not have the least doubt the three wereseized by soldiers dressed in civilian clothes.''   According to human rights organizations, most of the more than70,000 people killed in a 10-year-old leftist guerrilla war havebeen civilians slain by rightist death squads that were especiallyactive from 1979 to 1984.   Death-squad activity sharply diminished in mid-1984 with theelection of President Jose Napoleon Duarte, a centrist ChristianDemocrat. Repression of leftists started again when rightistPresident Alfredo Cristiani succeeded Duarte on June 1 for afive-year term.   Leftists have often accused Cristiani's Republican NationalistAlliance of being linked to the death squads, made up of off-dutymilitary and security agents.   A bomb wrecked the headquarters of the Salvadoran NationalWorkers' Federation on Oct. 31, killing 10 people and wounding 29.Earlier that day, another bomb injured four people at Comadres, anorganization of relatives of political prisoners and people who havedisappeared in the civil war.   Two of those injured in the blasts were Americans.   Leaders of those two leftist groups accused the military ofmounting the bombings in retaliation for an Oct. 30 mortar attack bythe Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front on the DefenseMinistry compound that killed one civilian and wounded 15.   The Social Christian Popular Movement was created in 1980 bydissidents who broke away from Duarte's Christian Democratic Party.The San Salvador home of party leader Ruben Zamora was bombed Oct.19, but no one was hurt.   Zamora is a member of the Democratic Revolutionary Front, apolitical coalition allied to the Farabundo Marti guerrillas. Helong lived in exile but returned to El Salvador two years ago whenthe Duarte government promised an end to repression.   Flores said that now the union halls, offices and otherinstallations were being closed because the party does not want tosee more members killed.   To protest the attacks, Farabundo Marti canceled itsparticipation in a third meeting with Cristiani governmentrepresentatives Nov. 20-21 in Caracas, Venezuela, to negotiate acease-fire.   Earlier meetings in Mexico and San Jose, Costa Rica, ended indeadlock but the two sides had agreed to continue meeting at 30-dayintervals until they could agree on some kind of a truce.</TEXT></DOC>
