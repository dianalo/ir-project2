(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Fred Jackson, a decorated Vietnam Warveteran, plans to join his buddies in Washington on July Fourth,but he might not be able to make the trip again. The government istrying to deport him.   Jackson, an immigrant from Scotland who volunteered for a hitchin Vietnam even though he wasn't a U.S. citizen, knows the U.S.Immigration and Naturalization Service has a strong case. He's had21 felony convictions and spent six years in a Florida prison forarmed robbery since he left the Army in 1970.   But the 39-year-old Jackson believes his troubles can be tracedto post-traumatic stress disorder, and he hopes an immigrationjudge takes that into consideration at his July 21 deportationhearing.   He said the disorder, which has been found in Vietnam veteransand victims of violent crimes, led him to heavy drug and alcoholabuse to escape flashbacks of terrifying ambushes and firefightsfrom his nine months in Vietnam.   Jackson, wearing his Silver and Bronze stars and two PurpleHearts, staged a small demonstration with family and friendsoutside the federal building here Friday before heading forWashington to join other veterans at the Vietnam War memorial.   He insists he's not bitter and would enlist again, though someof his friends said he is getting a raw deal.   ``There was a war going on and I thought I had an obligation todefend the country I was living in,'' said Jackson, a slight manwith a wispy moustache and a rash of blue tattoos on both arms whospeaks with a hint of an accent.   ``I love this country,'' said Jackson. ``I'd go back to Vietnamagain in a heartbeat. I'd do it all again.''.   Jackson, his wife, their baby and her young son live in a toughhousing project in Norwich on $628-a-month disability payments fromthe Army. He will soon begin treatment at a post-traumatic stressunit at the Veterans Administration Medical Center in Northampton,Mass.   Jackson enlisted when he was 18 in 1967, two years after hisfamily emigrated to Norwich, an industrial city about 30 milessoutheast of Hartford. He was shipped off to Vietnam in January1968 as an infantryman with the 1st Air Cavalry Division.   In May 1968, he said, he was wounded when his squad wasambushed. He recovered and was sent back into action, and waswounded again with shrapnel. Jackson said he still can't get theepisodes out of his mind.   ``I seclude myself, I sort of live in my own prison,'' he said.``I'm up and down looking out the windows all the time. My wifetells me I check the perimeter all night.''   After nine months in Vietnam, Jackson said he was sent to FortBenning, Ga.   He said he started drinking heavily and used marijuana,barbituates and heroin ``anything that would make me pass out so Iwouldn't have to face the flashbacks.'' The Army gave him abad-conduct discharge, later upgraded to an honorable discharge.   He did time in county jails in five or six states fordrug-related offenses and petty crimes before he held up a store inFlorida in 1979. When he got out of prison in 1985, the governmentrenewed earlier efforts to deport him.   John Weiss, officer-in-charge of the INS office in Hartford,said resident aliens who have been convicted of two crimesinvolving ``moral turpitude'' are subject to deportation, but wouldnot comment on Jackson's case.   Robert D. Money of the International Institute of ConnecticutInc., Jackson's legal representative, said he believes there is agood chance Jackson will be allowed to stay, and Jackson'ssupporters said he deserves amnesty.   ``Here's a man that volunteered to serve that didn't have to,''said Alfred Hill, a Vietnam veteran and neighbor. ``He was willingto give up his life for his country. Why should he all of a suddenbe kicked out?''</TEXT></DOC>
