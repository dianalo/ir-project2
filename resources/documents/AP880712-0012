However, Giuliani and Securities and Exchange CommissionChairman David S. Ruder both cautioned that the law should exemptfirms and supervisors that make a good-faith effort to stop theiremployees from using non-public information to profit from tradingin securities.   ``All of us are certainly sensitive to the fact that wheneveranyone runs any institution, large or small, they can be victimizedby the criminal activities of others,'' said Giuliani, whose officehas prosecuted a string of prominent Wall Street insider tradingcases during the last two years.   Meanwhile, Ruder said his agency is investigating the role ofthe firm that employed Stephen Wang Jr., accused two weeks ago inthe second-biggest insider trading case ever handled by the SEC.   Wang, a 24-year-old Morgan Stanley andamp; Co. analyst, is accused ofpassing non-public information to Fred C. Lee, a Hong Kongbusinessman. The $19 million in illegal profits they allegedlyreaped is second only to the Ivan Boesky case.   ``We will be looking ... at whether Morgan Stanley's supervisoryprocedures were adequate and whether Morgan Stanley bears anyfault,'' Ruder told reporters outside the hearing room.   ``If they were directly responsible for the activity ... wemight consider including them as one of the parties to the action,but I don't mean for a minute to suggest that we have anyindication of that at all,'' he said.   Ruder and Giuliani said a draft bill offered by Rep. Edward J.Markey, D-Mass., chairman of the House Energy and Commerce financesubcommittee, should more carefully spell out when brokerage firmswould be subject to fines for the violations of their employees.   John W. Bachmann, chairman of the Securities IndustryAssociation, the trade group representing brokerages, said firmsand supervisors should be required to have policies designed toprevent insider trading. But he said they should be held liableonly when they actively aided a violation.   Bachmann also sought to limit a provision that would allow theSEC to pay bounties of up to 10 percent of any insider-tradingpenalty to informers who tip the agency off to a violation. He saidparticipants in an insider trading scheme should not be allowed toreceive bounties.   Ruder also expressed reservations, saying juries may not believewitnesses who are paid to testify.   However, Giuliani said the Internal Revenue Service has usedbounties effectively to prosecute tax cheats. Although tipsters aresometimes peripherally involved in illegalities, it is worth payinga reward when it results in a windfall for federal coffers, he said.   ``It's the only way in which you are going to bring thisinformation forward,'' he said.   Markey said he intends to pass the bill out of his subcommitteein time for congressional action this year.   Other provisions increase the fines for insider trading, createa basis for private investors to sue inside traders and enhance theSEC's power to cooperate in investigations with foreign securitiesagencies.</TEXT></DOC>
