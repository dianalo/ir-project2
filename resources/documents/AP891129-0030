ButEast Germany's leaders apparently see Kohl's ideas as something ofa Trojan Horse laden with suspicious cargo.   Kohl on Tuesday outlined a 10-point plan to gradually unite thetwo German states, saying he wants reunification but acknowledgingit could take time.   The chancellor wrapped his ideas into a far-reaching concept ofovercoming the overall divisions of Europe, stepping up disarmamentand forging closer links between the European Economic Communityand Eastern Europe.   Kohl's proposals are specific in some areas but appear generalenough to save him from criticism at home that he is being toomeddlesome in East German domestic affairs.   His speech is already being hailed as probably the greatest ofhis political career, even by some usually severe critics.   ``During Kohl's years in office, seldom has there been theopportunity to praise the chancellor for a speech,'' the newspaperStuttgarter Nachtrichten said in a commentary today.   But the newspaper said of Tuesday's address to Parliament:   ``Helmut Kohl has given an important speech, if not a historicone.''   Kohl's speech even won praise from opposition politicians whohave steadfastly maintained in recent weeks that while East Germanywas falling apart, the chancellor has been too slow in producingneeded assistance for the embattled Communist neighbor.   Hans-Jochen Vogel, Kohl's arch foe as head of the oppositionSocial Democrats, presented his own plan for closer ties with EastGermany. It had much in common with Kohl's. The chief differencewas, Vogel spoke out for a loose German confederation and saidnothing about formal reunification.   Karsten Voigt, an important Social Democrat lawmaker, said heagrees with the chancellor ``on all 10 points'' and offered to helpfulfill them.   Nonetheless, Voigt cautioned Kohl against telling the EastGermans what sort of future they should choose for their country.   Even though Kohl made it clear he still wants formal Germanreunification at some point, his vagueness on what he foresees inthe short-term has annoyed East Germany's Communist leaders.   Kohl proposed that the two German states set up ``confederativestructures'' such as joint government bodies for regularconsultations.   East Germans might be interested in a confederation if itensures their country would not be swallowed up into a singleGerman federation, but that would be at odds with Kohl's proposals.   Wolfgang Meyer, spokesman for the East German government, saidKohl's mention of ``confederative structures'' was heard ``withinterest.''   But Meyer said Kohl ``avoided saying clearly that it could onlyconcern a confederation between two sovereign nations.''   ``Reunification is not on the agenda and no one in the East orthe West is earnest about changing European stability,'' he said.   East German Communist Party leader Egon Krenz said a unitedGermany would raise thoughts of Nazi Germany of 1937, ``and I knowno one in the world who would like such a Germany.''   Kohl also repeated his view that without a total overhaul ofEast Germany's planned economy, massive West German assistancewould be throwing money away.   ``We do do not want to stabilize conditions which have becomeindefensible,'' Kohl said.   And on that point as well, Kohl's 10-point plan earned himlittle trust among East German leaders who fear disappearance oftheir Socialist system could increase their vulnerability toreunification.   ``We are ready to cooperate with the Federal Republic (WestGermany), but we are not to get into conditions orpre-requisites,'' Krenz said.</TEXT></DOC>
