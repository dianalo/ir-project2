The poll, which underscores public concern about aneconomic recession, shows that the public is equally dividedover whom to blame if no agreement is reached to reduce thefederal budget deficit. If the talks fail, 34% say the Bushadministration would be mostly to blame, while 31% say thatthe Democrats in Congress would be mostly to blame.</LP><TEXT>   Top congressional and administration officials continuedbudget talks at the Capitol yesterday, seeking to break theimpasse over taxes and other issues.   The WSJ/NBC News poll, taken by Peter Hart, a Democrat,and Robert Teeter, a Republican, was based on telephoneinterviews Sept. 15-18 with 1,508 registered voters acrossthe nation. The poll carries a margin of error of 2.6percentage points.   The results show virtually no public preference betweenthe Democratic plan, which, among other elements, includes anenergy tax and an additional income surtax on the verywealthy, and the Bush administration plan, which includes asmaller energy tax, limits on deductions for state and localincome taxes and a cut in the capital-gains tax.   &quot;There is as much division on the issue among the publicas there is between the president and Congress,&quot; Mr. Hart andMr. Teeter say.   The poll shows that 43% of the public prefer theDemocratic plan, with 41% preferring the Bush administrationplan.   A Journal/NBC News poll in January showed the public splitover cutting the capital-gains tax, which assesses levies onthe profits from the sale of stocks, bonds and real estate.In that poll, 47% opposed a capital-gains tax cut and 45%supported it.   Meanwhile, the poll shows there remains strong publicconcern about the prospect of a recession. A majority (51%)believes there will be a recession. The Iraqi invasion ofKuwait triggered a major upsurge in public apprehensionsabout the prospect of a recession; those apprehensionshaven't disappeared in the past six weeks even though theinitial shock of the invasion has worn off. Thirty-fivepercent believe there won't be a recession. Republicans areslightly less sure of the prospect of a recession than areDemocrats.   The budget talks that continued behind closed doorsyesterday were again limited, as they had been Tuesday, tothe five highest-ranking congressional leaders of bothparties and three top administration officials, in an effortto cut down on acrimony and information leaks. At Tuesday'ssession, House Speaker Thomas Foley (D., Wash.) and SenateMajority Leader George Mitchell (D., Maine) asked to meetwith President Bush, but administration officials saidnegotiations had to show more progress before the presidentgot involved again, congressional aides said.   Meanwhile, House Democratic leaders began considering theneed for an emergency government-funding bill, including apossible provision to suspend across-the-board spending cutsthat would be triggered in October by the Gramm-Rudmandeficit-reduction law absent some budget accord.   Without an agreement in place after Oct. 1, the start offiscal 1991, government programs would be unfunded and atleast $85 billion in automatic cuts would be imposed by thelaw. Senate GOP Leader Robert Dole began circulating a letterto President Bush promising to support his veto of anymeasure waiving the cuts. But given the pain such cuts wouldimpose on federal workers and beneficiaries of numerousprograms, Sen. Dole was having trouble getting signatures.   The four-month-old budget impasse and threatening fiscalbreakdown has fed frustration among lawmakers. Some HouseDemocrats now propose to draft their own budget that wouldmeet the budget negotiators' goal of $50 billion in budgetcuts for fiscal 1991, while protecting Democrats' favoritesocial programs. But proponents acknowledged any such budgetwould be difficult to pass. And House Democratic LeaderRichard Gephardt (D., Mo.) said he told the group that thesummit negotiators &quot;have got to keep talking and see what wecan accomplish.&quot;   Despite congressional leaders' recommitment Tuesday tobargain in &quot;good faith,&quot; the troops from both partiesmobilized to put their own partisan spin on the impassethrough news conferences and floor speeches. Democratscomplained that only President Bush's insistence on lowercapital-gains taxes for the rich blocked a budget agreement.Republicans in turn stressed that many other differencesremained, including the amount and kind of energy taxes andMedicare cuts.   ---   &quot;If no agreement is reached on how to reduce the federalbudget deficit, who do you think will be mostly to blame --the Bush administration or the Democrats in Congress?&quot;                                                                                                                                                                                                                    DEMOCRATS IN CONGRESS                   31%                                                                                                             BOTH EQUALLY (Volunteered)              17%                                                                                                          The Wall Street Journal/NBC News Poll</TEXT></DOC>
