SaysIt Is in ViolationOf Loan Covenants</HL><DD> 04/01/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> TVLA </IN><DATELINE> DALLAS  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Taco Villa Inc. is in violation of certain covenants of its loan agreement with RepublicBank Corp., the company disclosed in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.    The Mexican restaurant chain also said it is unable to report its 1986 results because of financial uncertainties.    Taco Villa said it is attempting to negotiate waivers to coverage ratio covenants in the agreement with RepublicBank and is considering the sale of some assets to repay its debt. The company received a waiver of compliance with the covenants in June and September 1986 but the bank hasn't granted further waivers.    According to Taco Villa, the company has about $11 million in loans under the credit agreement with RepublicBank and $1.7 million of that is due May 1. Taco Villa is also trying to extend $1.2 million in mortgage payments due RepublicBank of Midland, Texas, and other banks this year, the filing said.    Taco Villa earlier reported that it will take a charge of about $9 million for the fourth quarter of 1986 to reflect losses on restaurant closings. The sale of other assets, however, may result in further write-downs, the company said, making it impossible to complete its 1986 financial statements now. Those results will be reported to the SEC in an amendment to the company's financial statement later, the company said.    In 1985, Taco Villa had a net loss of $561,000 on revenue of $78.1 million. </TEXT></DOC>
