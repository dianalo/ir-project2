(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A 5-week-old baby living with her familyat a local homeless shelter has died from head injuries, and policesuspect two 4-year-olds may be responsible for the death.   Sarah Franklin died at Saturday morning, but police didn'trelease details of the incident until Wednesday after receiving anautopsy report that classified the death as a homicide.   The chief state medical examiner's office determined the infantdied from severe head injuries. There were also bruises and bitemarks on the body.   Sarah and her twin were left alone on a bed in their second-floorroom at St. Luke's Community Services family shelter while theirmother, Suzette Franklin, went downstairs to sterilize a bottle,police said.   A neighbor entered the Franklin room and found Sarah lying on thefloor, police said. The baby's mother thought she had locked thedoor when she left, but one of the 4-year-olds suspected in the caseshowed police how to open the locked door.   The unrelated 4-year-old girl and boy suspected in the case livednear the Franklin room, police said. They have not been identifiedand they won't be charged with any crime because of their age,police said.   Deputy Police Chief John Perrotta said the two children didn'tintend to kill the baby, although police still haven't put togetherthe events leading up to the death.   The deputy chief also said the parents of the children involvedwon't be charged with any crime.   Police said they are trying to get permission from the parents ofthe 4-year-olds to get teeth impressions in an effort to determinethe source of bite marks. Police would not say whether the teethmarks appeared to have been made by a child or an adult.   The infant's mother has moved from the shelter and her two otherchildren, Sarah's twin and a 17-month-old boy, are in the custody ofthe Department of Children and Youth Services until the policeinvestigation is completed.   ``Every member of the staff feels terribly about this. We willlive with this for the rest of our lives,'' said the Rev. RichardSchuster, the shelter's coordinator.</TEXT></DOC>
