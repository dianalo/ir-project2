Sease</HL><DD> 12/02/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> STOCK MARKET, OFFERINGS (STK)STOCK INDEXES (NDX) </IN><TEXT>   Frightened by Monday's precipitous market drop, investors bid stock prices up hesitantly yesterday in moderate trading.    A strong dollar got the market off to a quick start, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average rising more than 30 points in the first 15 minutes. But investors turned skittish and the average closed at 1842.34, up only 8.79.    On the New York Stock Exchange, 819 issues advanced and 771 fell; volume shrank to 149.9 million shares from nearly 270 million in Monday's market plunge.    &quot;It wasn't a very enthusiastic rally,&quot; said Jon Groveman, a trader at Ladenburg Thalmann. &quot;People are very distrustful of the market right now, and the major problem is that there isn't any trading or market theme that stays in place for more than a day.&quot;    Mr. Groveman said the market's sluggish performance yesterday is worrisome because the dollar held most of its gains. &quot;It's a negative sign that the dollar is much stronger but the market put on a poor performance,&quot; he said. He added that further declines in stock prices may be needed before bargain-hunters begin buying in any sizable numbers. &quot;It may have to get down to the point that people say, `I don't care what's going on, stocks are cheap.' &quot;    Other market analysts, agreeing that further drops may benecessary to stimulate substantial buyer interest, sayinvestors are hypersensitive to any news that could be viewedas negative.   &quot;Immediately after the crash a weaker dollar moved the cyclical stocks higher and was viewed as bullish, but now a weaker dollar is being seen as bearish,&quot; said one trader. &quot;We're drifting along at an impasse and we may need another leg downward to shake some interest loose.&quot;    Alfred Goldman, a technical analyst at A.G. Edwards in St. Louis, characterized Tuesday's performance as &quot;a very normal knee-jerk reflex bounce in an overall down market.&quot;    Still, not everyone was discouraged. &quot;The market was down three days in a row and the pressure to sell came off considerably,&quot; said Fred Lange, president of Lange Financial Services in New York. He pointed out that rallies Tuesday in foreign markets, the dollar's strength and the likelihood of Germany cutting its discount rate later this week all contributed to a better mood on Wall Street.    He said foreign investors are watching to see if the U.S. can produce a definitive package of budget-deficit reduction measures. &quot;If that's resolved satisfactorily, you'll have a G-7 meeting to stabilize the currency&quot; that would tend to bolster foreign interest in the U.S. market. The U.S. is among the major industrialized nations belonging to the Group of Seven.    Japanese blue-chip issues, traded on the Big Board as American depositary receipts, were among the big gainers yesterday, though trading was thin. Barbara Safranek, a securities analyst with S.G. Warburg, said the securities were boosted by the dollar's strength and their own solid performance in overnight trading on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. The stocks had declined over the past few weeks.    Matsushita Electric was the top gainer on the Big Board, up 7 1/4 to 160 1/4. Kyocera rose 4 1/8 to 75 1/4, Hitachi gained 4 to 89 1/2, Honda was up 3 1/8 to 94 1/4, and Pioneer Electronic rose 3 to 37 1/2.    McDonnell Douglas, Boeing and Rockwell all rose in response to news that NASA had selected the firms to negotiate space station construction contracts that could be worth as much as $6.5 billion. McDonnell Douglas rose 1 3/8 to 58 5/8, Boeing gained 7/8 to 35 1/4, and Rockwell closed at 16 1/2, up 1/8. General Electric, another winner in the NASA selection, was unchanged at 42.    Southland gained 3 5/8 to close at 64 1/8. The company filed a new financing package with the Securities and Exchange Commission that it said will allow it to to go private by completing its merger with JT Acquisitions, a private firm owned by the founding Thompson family.    Rising blue-chip issues included Phelps Dodge, which gained 1 1/8 to 41 1/8. The company predicted record earnings for 1987. Eastman Kodak was up 1/4 to 45 5/8 in active trading, Goodyear Tire andamp; Rubber rose 1 5/8 to 50 1/4, International Business Machines climbed 1/2 to 111 1/4, and Exxon rose 1/4 to 37, also in active trading.    Most gold stocks recovered from their declines in Monday's sell-off. American Barrick gained 1/2 to 22, ASA rose 1 1/2 to 53 1/8, Battle Mountain Group was up 1 1/4 to 20 3/4, Freeport McMoRan climbed 1/2 to 23 3/4, and Newmont Gold rose 7/8 to 38 1/2. Atlas Corp. fell 1 1/4 to 34 1/4, and Hecla Mining was down 1/2 to 14 5/8.    Tobacco stocks also gained. Philip Morris gained 1 1/2 to 87 3/8, RJR Nabisco was up 1/2 to 46 3/4, and American Brands rose 1/2 to 37 3/4. The gains came despite an anti-smoking group's claim yesterday that a tobacco industry representative had conceded for the first time that smoking is &quot;related to&quot; cancer, heart disease and chronic lung disease. The group's statement wasn't considered as damaging as had been expected.    Losers Tuesday included CBS, down 3 3/8 to 152, and Capital Cities/ABC, off 1 1/4 to 311 3/4. Xerox fell 2 1/4 to 50 5/8. The company hasn't commented on speculation that it is considering acquiring E.F. Hutton Group. Hutton's financial advisers set noon Tuesday as the deadline for proposals. Hutton closed at 27 5/8, up 1/8.    Other active stocks included Duquesne Light, up 1/8 to 11 5/8; Texas Utilities, down 1/8 to 28; Church's Fried Chicken, down 3/4 to 5; and American Telephone andamp; Telegraph, unchanged at 27. </TEXT></DOC>
