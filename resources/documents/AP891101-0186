The attack came one day after the bombing of a laborfederation's headquarters in which 10 people were killed and 29wounded.   Guerrillas aboard a red pickup truck stopped two blocks from theentrance of the army headquarters in the city's northern sector,witnesses and soldiers said. The rebels fired two anti-tankweapons, both of which struck a car that pulled out from a sidestreet into the line of fire.   The car's driver, identified by rescue workers as HermogenesMartinez, was mortally wounded by the rockets, which demolished hiscar. A spokeswoman at the downtown Rosales Hospital said Martinez,59, died in the emergency room.   A street vendor was wounded in the attack, the rescue workersreported.   On Tuesday, terrorists bombed the leftist National Federation ofSalvadoran Workers hall in downtown San Salvador.   A strike call by the workers federation, popularly known asFenastras, remained largely unheeded Wednesday, with publictransportation running normally, and plants, banks and shops doingbusiness as usual.   Farabundo Marti National Front guerrillas blamed the rightistgovernment of President Alfredo Cristiani for Tuesday's bombing andvowed to avenge the slain unionists. No one claimed responsibility.   ``The moment for combat has arrived. The moment for setting fireto the fascists has arrived,'' the guerrillas said in a broadcaston their clandestine Radio Venceremos.   Leftist leaders often refer to members of the governingRepublican Nationalist Alliance party as ``fascists.''   ``The fascists are mistaken if they think they can terrorize thepeople like this. The times when the people would run and hide arepast. ... If it is war they want, then war they will get as theanswer to these crimes,'' the broadcast said.   The violence has threatened future talks between the guerrillasand Cristiani's government to end the decade-long civil war.   Four people were wounded, including an American citizen, whenanother bomb went off earlier Tuesday at the office of anorganization of relatives of missing persons and politicalprisoners.   Leftist organizations blamed the military for the attacksTuesday, saying they were in retaliation for a guerrilla mortarattack on the Defense Ministry compound Monday that killed onecivilian and wounded 15 others.   Military spokesmen rejected the leftists' accusation andpromised to investigate and punish those responsible.   The guerrilla broadcast further warned the attacks, ``committedby the high command,'' endanger a third meeting with governmentrepresentatives, scheduled for Nov. 20 in Caracas, Venezuela, totry negotiate a cease-fire in the war that has killed more than70,000 people.   ``From now on all workers are at war with (Defense Minister)Gen. Humberto Larios, the high command and the ARENA government,''the National Union of Salvadoran Workers, the largest laborfederation, said in a communique.   In Washington, State Department spokesman Richard Bouchercondemned the bombings but declined to assess blame for them. Hecriticized extremists of both the left and the right for thecontinuing violence.   ``The extreme left and right in El Salvador bring neitherliberation nor order, they bring suffering, terror and death,'' hesaid. ``We condemn these acts of violence.''</TEXT></DOC>
