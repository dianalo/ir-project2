Astrotech declined to disclose the proposed price for the units it is selling.    Astrotech said it signed a letter of intent to sell its Quasitronics Inc. and Xetca Inc. units to Robert F. Kastelic, current president and chief operating officer of Astrotech. Mr. Kastelic will leave Astrotech to manage the two businesses, which have combined sales of about $6 million annually, Astrotech said.    Quasitronics designs and manufactures computer peripheral hardware, instrumentation and control systems. Xetca is a precision metal fabrication company operating under the name X-Mark Industries.    Astrotech last year sold its specialty metals business, its largest unit. The company also withdrew from previous ambitious space plans, including proposals to finance construction of a space shuttle and to build space platforms.    Astrotech has about $18 million of cash and $20 million of tax-loss carry-forwards that it intends to employ in new businesses, said Raymond T. Royko, vice president and secretary. He declined to say what type of businesses Astrotech is negotiating to buy. </TEXT></DOC>
