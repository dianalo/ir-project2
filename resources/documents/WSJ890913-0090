In a telephone conference with more than a dozen industry analysts, Mr. Rifenburgh painted a generally upbeat future picture for MiniScribe, noting sales are expected to drop only modestly this year, to more than $500 million, compared with an unaudited $603 million in 1988.    But analysts who follow MiniScribe were less sanguine. MiniScribe's stock, already battered by disclosures of questionable financial results, closed at $1.3125 a share, down 75 cents in national over-the-counter trading. It was the most actively traded over-the-counter stock yesterday, with more than 3.1 million shares trading hands.    The company has said that it is operating at a loss, but hasn't produced quarterly financial figures this year and has said that it can't produce reliable financial results for at least the past three years.    Mr. Rifenburgh took the reins at MiniScribe in February after the abrupt resignation of Q.T. Wiles, the corporate turnaround artist who had been summoned in 1985 when the company was in financial trouble. Soon the company was posting sharp gains in earnings and profits. But an internal investigation ordered by Mr. Rifenburgh, a summary of which was released late Monday, showed that senior officials at the company used a variety of ruses to fabricate sales gains, including counting shipments of bricks and defective drives as sales.    Much of the company's hopes are pinned on a new 3 1/2-inch disk drive that is only one inch tall and which MiniScribe hopes to ship in volume in early 1990. Mr. Rifenburgh said six MiniScribe customers have evaluated prototypes thus far and have unanimously given them high performance ratings.    But problems remain. Alexa McCloughan, an analyst who follows MiniScribe for Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co., said she doesn't question the company's viability, at least in the short term, but wonders whether it can become profitable.    Steven L. Ossad, of Montgomery Securities, said he is troubled by MiniScribe's repeated refusal to identify major customers. He also believes that MiniScribe won't get its next generation of disk drives, the 2 1/2-inch models, into the marketplace in time to capture a significant market share. Mr. Rifenburgh said that model won't go into production before late 1990 or early 1991.    Mr. Rifenburgh also acknowledged that he has visited Japan in recent weeks to resolve quality and delivery problems at MiniScribe's sole source of microprocessors. Although the problems may cause some short-term shortages, Mr. Rifenburgh said he believes the problems have been solved.    He also acknowledged that technical problems with the drive's software have pushed back production dates, although he said the delays have been less than a quarter.    MiniScribe's cash situation was described by Mr. Rifenburgh as &quot;pretty good,&quot; as reflected in a reduction of accounts payable from $160 million to less than $100 million. But much of the company's positive cash flow in recent months has been created by its willingness to &quot;cannibalize&quot; inventory, he added, and MiniScribe has used up its short-term credit line of $70 million.    The company is also saddled with $97 million in convertible debentures and approximately $100 million in trade debt. The credit crunch means the company will have to turn to existing assets for working capital to gear up production of the one-inch drives.    Separately, Moody's Investors Service Inc. said it downgraded the company's long-term subordinated debt, due 2012, to Ca from Caa.    The size of MiniScribe's asset base will remain unknown for at least another six weeks. Mr. Rifenburgh said the company's auditors, Coopers andamp; Lybrand, still are &quot;not far enough along to put numbers&quot; on MiniScribe's financial situation. &quot;I think it's clear that we'll have a pretty significant negative net worth,&quot; he added.    Asked about the financial overhang created by a dozen shareholder lawsuits, Mr. Rifenburgh noted that the plaintiffs, mostly shareholders, would be &quot;silly&quot; to push MiniScribe into Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings because the company's debtors would take precedence. The suits, he added, are &quot;just a burden you have to live with, although in this case they obviously have some merit.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
