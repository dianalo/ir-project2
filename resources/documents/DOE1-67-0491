Noticing,inter alia, the liquid-phase reaction which was considered to be mostcontributable to generation of sulfuric acid through oxidation of sulfurdioxide, an oxidation reaction of sulfurous acid ion (S(IV)) into sulfuricacid was examined. First of all, various test solutions of the similarcompositions to those of the various kinds of the rain water were preparedand oxidation rates of S(IV) in the solutions were measured. In particular,catalytic effects of metal ions (Fe{sup 3+} and Mn{sup 2+}) were examined.As a result, in both cases of model test solutions and rain water samples,the primary dependability of the concentration of S(IV) was shown anda strong positive correlationship was recognized between oxidation rateand the concentration of Fe{sup 3+} or Mn{sup 2+}. When the experimentalequation of rate of oxidation reaction of S(IV), which had been derivedfrom the results obtained with the test solutions, was applied to theoxidation reaction of S(IV) in the actural rain water sample and theoxidation rate of the latter was calculated, the calculated values agreedgreatly with the actually measured values.
