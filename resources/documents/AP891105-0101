A handful of Republicans and Democrats have expressed oppositionto the military blueprint for fiscal 1990. Some complain that thelegislation is a ``jobs bill,'' while others say two types ofland-based nuclear missile is too many.   ``On nuclear weapons, we produced a strategic mush that decidesabsolutely nothing,'' Rep. Charles Bennett, D-Fla., a member of theHouse Armed Services Committee, said Friday. ``We need a strategicdiet that cancels some nuclear weapons to end duplication.''   All the same, indications are that the defense bill for thefiscal year that began Oct. 1 will win approval in the House andSenate, and receive the president's signature. The House may takeup the legislation this week.   Also this week, Democrats and Republicans will continue theirefforts to nail down an agreement that would allow congressionalpassage of a debt-limit extension and a deficit-reduction bill.   The government has reached its borrowing limit of $2.8 trillion,and default will occur unless the ceiling is extended early in theweek.   Agreement also could allow Congress to try to roll back the$16.1 billion in cuts in most federal programs imposed under theGramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law on Oct. 1.   Sen. John Warner of Virginia, ranking Republican on the SenateArmed Services Committee, said Thursday that the defense bill``reflects support for the president, particularly in those areaswhere he felt it essential at the bargaining table in the armscontrol arena,''   The bill, adopted by House and Senate conferees after nearly twomonths of wrangling, slashes $1.1 billion from Bush's request of$4.9 billion for the Strategic Defense Initiative, commonly knownas Star Wars.   The cut represents a 7 percent drop from the amount spent on theprogram in fiscal 1989 and marks the first year that SDI hassuffered a decrease in spending.   On the other strategic programs _ the MX nuclear missile, theMidgetman missile and the B-2 stealth bomber _ the administrationexperienced limited cuts. The defense bill trimmed $150 millionfrom the approximately $1.2 billion Bush sought for the twoland-based missiles and provided money for two B-2 bombers _ oneless than the administration sought in fiscal 1990.   The most contentious issues were Bush's proposal to cancel 10programs, including the Navy's F-14D Tomcat jet fighter and theMarine Corps' V-22 Osprey.   The congressional negotiators decided to continue two programs _the F-14D and the AHIP helicopter _ for one more year beforekilling the program, and postponed a decision on the V-22 Ospreyand the Phoenix missile. The conferees accepted theadministration's plan to kill six other programs, including theSSN-688 submarine, the F-15 aircraft and the M-88 tank recoveryvehicle.   Conservative organizations, including the Center for Peace andFreedom, have called on Bush to veto the bill because of the cut inStar Wars spending. Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said he ``wouldhave preferred a higher level of funding for SDI.''   But lawmakers have contended all along that support for theprogram is diminishing, and defense analysts said theadministration was clearly concerned about other issues.   ``It's significant that the administration did better on B-2, MXand Midgetman than it did on SDI,'' John Isaacs, head of theliberal group, Council for a Livable World, said Friday. ``Thepriority for this administration is other issues, not SDI.''   Among the other provisions of the defense bill is the barring ofany money for the F-16 aircraft _ one of the Air Force's topprograms _ ``until it shapes up and takes close air supportseriously,'' said the House Armed Services Committee in its reporton the legislation. The administration had sought $3.4 billion forthe program.   The bill trims about $500 million from the troubled Trident IImissile, provides only about $900 million of the $1.1 billion theadministration requested for the Advanced Tactical Fighter and adds$848 million for the National Guard and Reserves.   The bill also eliminates 14,500 positions in Europe associatedwith the intermediate-range nuclear missiles, banned under theU.S.-Soviet treaty signed in December 1987, and includesSenate-passed burden sharing provisions.   ``We're saying to our NATO allies, the percentage of U.S. forcesin Europe is not going to increase. If you reduce your forces, oursare going to be reduced too unless some other country makes up forit,'' Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the Senate Armed ServicesCommittee, said Thursday.   The bill also eliminates a Senate-approved provision that wouldhave given federal agents the authority to shoot down a planesuspected of transporting illegal narcotics into the United States.</TEXT></DOC>
