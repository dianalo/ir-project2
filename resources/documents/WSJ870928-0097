When you know the right person.    Or at least the right travel agent.    With a little juggling, travel agents can void any airline ticket as much as a week after selling it -- and spare the customer cancellation penalties. Normally, of course, airlines waive no-refund policies only in very special circumstances. But some agents admit they void such tickets for loyal customers who simply want to change plans.    &quot;It's kind of a trade secret, but I'm sure everyone does it occasionally,&quot; says Alan Coffin, a chapter president of the American Society of Travel Agents and owner of Fair Winds Tours in Stoneham, Mass. &quot;It's easy to do.&quot;    Here's why: When agencies sell tickets, they don't pay airlines immediately. Instead, agents make all payments every Tuesday. Until that payment is made, it's difficult for airlines to catch an agent cancelling a reservation from the past week and voiding the ticket, according to several agents and airline officials.    Airlines contend the practice violates their business agreements with travel agencies. &quot;Our policy doesn't allow this and we would take steps to discourage it from continuing,&quot; says a spokesman for Continental Airlines.    He didn't elaborate, but it's easy for airlines to retaliate against travel agencies. Carriers can, for example, stop any agency from selling their tickets. Airlines can also offer special travel packages only to a competing agency.    &quot;If they want to play games with us, then we can play games with them,&quot; says one airline official.    The Wall Falls   One of the major runways at Chicago's Midway airport is shorter than many, but pilots aren't likely to overrun it. There's a concrete wall at one end.    Early this year, the city of Chicago finished erecting a concrete wall that's only several hundred feet behind a runway used frequently by commercial airliners at Midway. Many pilots were dismayed, particularly since the runway is 4,000 feet shorter than those at many major airports.    &quot;Why put up something that could kill people in an irregular operation?&quot; asks D.B. Robinson, an area safety coordinator for the Air Line Pilots Association, the union for commercial pilots.    Good question. City officials say the barrier was put up to protect nearby residents from jet noise and jet blast. But after talking with the pilots, the city has decided to tear down the wall later this year and replace it with a lighter structure. The total cost for all this hasn't been determined, but it cost over $400,000 in federal and city funds to build the present wall.    &quot;Now that we're aware of the pilots' concern, we want to address them,&quot; says a spokeswoman for Chicago's Department of Aviation.    And what does the Federal Aviation Adminstration, which oversees airports, say about this? Not much. &quot;We weren't aware they were going to remove the wall,&quot; an agency spokesman says. &quot;We thought it was safe to have it.&quot;    Rental-Car Ruling   With the big rental car companies raising their prices this year, many people have started trying off-airport operators. But a recent court ruling could wipe out some of the pricing edge these smaller outfits have.    Unlike their on-airport competitors, car renters that operate outside airport terminals -- like Alamo and Thrifty -- normally haven't had to pay stiff concession fees to airport authorities. That's one reason their prices are often cheaper than on-airport operators'. But a federal appeals court in Atlanta recently ruled that the airport authority in Sarasota, Fla., could charge off-airport operators 10% of their annual gross revenue for running courtesy vans at the airport.    The authority says that without the new fee, the large rental companies might move out of the terminal and stop paying concessions. The court said local governments have &quot;wide latitude&quot; to impose such fees. The result: Alamo, Thrifty and others passed on the fee to renters in Sarasota.    For now, only a handful of small airports have similar fees, but the the ruling is expected to get the attention of larger fields. Altanta Hartsfield Airport, for example, now plans to impose a concession fee on off-airport operators. &quot;We were waiting for the ruling,&quot; says Kenneth Minton, properties manager there.    The dispute is far from over, though. Alamo, which calls such fees unreasonable, has asked the appeals court to reconsider its opinion. And several off-airport renters are lobbying Congress to propose a bill banning arbitrary airport fees. </TEXT></DOC>
