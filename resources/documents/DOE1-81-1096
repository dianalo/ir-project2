Actions would have to be filed against the AES atChernobyl to the Chernobyl county court, which would examine the claimsaccording to Soviet (Ukrainian) civil law, and taking into account twoaspects of liability, namely strict liability, and liability in tort.However, it would indeed be more realistic to expect that any such actionwould be dismissed by the court upon the directive of political authorities,as the Soviet Government certainly would have no interest at all to giveany foreign citizen the chance to win a case in such a politically significantmatter.
