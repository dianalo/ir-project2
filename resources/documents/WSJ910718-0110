The Labor Department said its consumer price index rose0.2% in June after increasing 0.3% in May. With energy pricesdiving after the Persian Gulf War, the consumer price indexrose at only a 2.7% annual rate in the first six months ofthe year. That's a big slowdown from last year's increase of6.1%.</LP><TEXT>   Meanwhile, largely because of an acceleration in renters'and homeowners' costs, consumer prices excluding the erraticfood and energy components -- the so-called core rate ofinflation -- were up 0.4% in June after a 0.2% increase inMay. Tobacco products, which make up only a small part of theindex, posted the biggest increase outside the food area,jumping 2.1% after rising 0.2% in May.   The core rate is watched by economists as a signal ofunderlying inflation trends, but most analysts saw the Juneincrease as a result of one-time factors that didn't posesignificant problems for the long-term inflation outlook.   &quot;It's nothing to be concerned about but at the same timeit doesn't give the Federal Reserve room to change from itsstance of holding interest rates steady,&quot; said Daryl Delano,an economist with Cahners Economics in Newton, Mass. Theadministration has been pressing the Fed to lower interestrates to stimulate the economy.   Some analysts, however, said other factors could keep theinflation rate a bit higher than expected. Carl Palash ofMcCarthy, Crisanti andamp; Maffei Inc., an economic and financialconsulting firm, said inventories are particularly low forclothing and autos and thus some discounting usually donelate in the year may be forgone.   Energy costs dropped 1% after increasing 1.4% in May --the first increase in six months. Energy prices were up 35.4%in 1990, but dropped at a 30% annual rate in the first sixmonths of 1991. Airline fares rose 0.6% in June afterslipping 9.7% in the prior three-month period as the war withIraq held down traffic.   The increase in housing starts put them over a one millionannual rate for the first time since November, the CommerceDepartment said. In June, work was begun on new houses at anannual rate of 1,040,000, up from 989,000 in May. Starts werestill 12.4% below the pace of June 1990.   Starts were up for both single-family homes, which rose toa 868,000 annual rate from 836,000, and for multiunitstructures, which jumped to a 172,000-unit pace in June froma 153,000 May rate. Starts rose in all regions except theWest.   Permits for future construction were also up, rising 3.7%to a 1,002,000-unit pace in June. Permits increasedthroughout the country.
