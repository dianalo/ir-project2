Because of his military might and his history of obstinate resistance to peace, Syria's President Hafez Assad is thought by many in the West to be immune to influence. In fact, the West today can do much to curtail the flow of funds on which Syria depends.    The numbers on Syria's external dependence are stunning. From 1977 through 1988, Syria spent about $77 billion on imports, only $35 billion of which was financed by exports and workers' remittances. The remaining $42 billion came from grants and loans, of which about $23 billion was supplied by the Soviets, $3 billion by the Iranians, $12 billion by the Saudis, Kuwaitis and other Gulf Arabs, and $4 billion by the West. The $42 billion in aid was more than the $39 billion Syria spent on the military in 1977-88.    The basic cause of Syria's poverty is the mistrust between the ruling Baath Party, dominated by Alawites, a disdained Moslem sect, and the businessmen who belong to the Sunni Moslem majority. As a result, Syria's strong entrepreneurial tradition and vibrant business community were squashed when the Baath Party took over in 1963.    When he first assumed power in 1970, Mr. Assad was less doctrinaire than his fellow Baathists. He instituted a policy of &quot;infiraj&quot; (relaxation), which encouraged entrepreneurs. The result was growth of 10% per year between 1970 and 1977. But Mr. Assad's unwillingness to share power and his foreign adventures stirred opposition from the Sunni majority; this escalated in 1981-82 into armed rebellion, which Mr. Assad put down with extreme cruelty.    Since the mid-1970s, the government has reverted to type and poured national resources into inefficient public enterprises while placing restrictions on the private sector. Inappropriate investments have absorbed perhaps $10 billion. The worst public project was a dam and irrigation network on the Euphrates. The new land was infertile and the high-cost technology worked so badly that farmers on the older areas reverted to their traditional lowtechnology, water-delivery techniques. Other poor investments include a $110 million paper mill that rarely works and an ammonia-urea plant that had to be converted to natural gas at a cost of an extra $100 million.    Growth rates in the 1980s have been less than 1% a year. The economy slipped into a crisis by 1985, with shortages everywhere. The government refused to recognize its failure, instead tolerating black markets so that corrupt officials could extort a share of the profits. Mr. Assad had hoped that recent oil discoveries would end the crisis, but they were insufficient: Syria's oil income will barely keep up with the needs of the expanding population at the current low living standard, much less allow for growth. The outlook for 1989 is particularly grim because of a drought that may have cut wheat output in half.    In short, Syria cannot generate the resources to pay for its military without liberalizing its economy -- and that would threaten Mr. Assad's political grip because he lacks the support of businessmen. Syrians are not ready to make substantial sacrifices for Mr. Assad's foreign policy aims and Mr. Assad has not been willing to force them to do so. One sign of his fiscal caution is that Syria's tax burden is lower than in Egypt or Jordan, much less Israel. Even so, Syria has a lower growth rate than any of its local rivals.    And so Syria remains entirely dependent on Soviet and Arab financing to sustain its military machine. This should give the West leverage over Syria.    One small step would be to stop all remaining Western finance by banning credit lines from banks and suppliers, offering no privileges to Syrian exports and prohibiting Western oil companies from developing the oil fields that this year will produce $1.5 billion in oil, mostly for domestic consumption. Brown andamp; Root, Marathon, Union Oil, Pecten, and other U.S. companies are involved in developing Syria's oil industry, which has never been placed off limits by U.S. government restrictions.    But the strongest influence the West could exert on Mr. Assad is through the Soviets, Saudis and Kuwaitis. The West has not been willing to make a linkage between relations with the Soviets or moderate Arabs and their support for Mr. Assad. Today, Western pressure to curtail aid to Syria would have a good chance of success because it would reinforce the natural inclination of the donors. The Soviets and the Gulf Arabs have financial problems of their own. Furthermore, the Soviets are no longer as interested as they once were in sustaining radical regimes with chronically ill economies, and the Arab states are less afraid of Syrian-inspired terrorism against them. Indeed, the Soviets and Saudis have already cut aid significantly since 1984, with the result that Syria has had to halve its military budget (after inflation) and move two divisions to reserve status.    Mr. Assad's muted reaction to the PLO statements that led to the opening of discussions between the U.S. and the PLO is a good example of how he has had to respond to the wishes of his friends in Riyadh and Moscow, who have made it clear that they do not want him to kill the peace process.    Mr. Assad must be made to pay a higher price for supporting terrorism. Syria permits Palestinian, Kurdish and Iranian terrorists to operate training camps in Syrian-controlled areas such as the Bekaa Valley. Ahmed Jabril, a Damascus-based Palestinian leader, is suspected of involvement in the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Scotland last December and the murder of those on board. It would be too much to hope for to expect the Soviets to stop arming their ally altogether, but we should hold them responsible when they provide the advanced missiles that limit our ability to attack the hostage takers' bases.    The U.S. has been extending its diplomatic dialogue with Syria in recent months, and has been discussing the fighting in Lebanon, where Syria continues to be the main culprit. Some in the State Department are even talking about establishing wider business ties, which Mr. Assad badly wants. But U.S. policy shouldn't be more carrot, but more stick. The U.S. should send a clear message that it holds Syria, not just Iran, responsible for the fate of the American hostages. Before rewarding Mr. Assad for his minimal steps in the past week on the hostages -- steps mostly designed to bring Hezbollah under his control -- the U.S. should first increase the pressure on him to stop rewarding terrorists.    ---   Mr. Clawson, formerly at the IMF and World Bank, is associated with the Washington Institute for Near East Policy and the Foreign Policy Research Institute. </TEXT></DOC>
