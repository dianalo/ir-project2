The phrase echoed as President Bush ordered Americantroops to crush and capture Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, whosePanamanian regime had withstood an arsenal of American sanctionsshort of force.   Part of the mission was reported accomplished within eight hourson Wednesday with the Pentagon declaring that Noriega had beenremoved as the strongarm leader of Panama.   But he escaped and supporters claimed he was still directing hisloyalist forces. The United States called him a fugitive, and saidhe would be tracked and taken, to stand trial on U.S. drugtrafficking indictments.   For more than two years, Noriega had taunted and incited thegiant, while his foes at home and in Washington tried futilely todislodge his grip on power. Bush, whose watchword is prudence, saidit was an enormous frustration. But he took it for nearly a year,for lack of an acceptable alternative.   Then he took a risk, and went to war. ``Fellow citizens, lastnight I ordered U.S. military forces to Panama,'' he told thenation Wednesday. ``I took this action only after reaching theconclusion that every other avenue was closed and the lives ofAmerican citizens were in grave danger.''   Bush gained prompt and predictable support at home, fromDemocrats as well as Republicans. He had briefed congressionalleaders just before U.S. forces went into combat against Noriega'sloyalists in the Panama Defense Forces.   Presidents seldom face much political dissent when Americanforces are in combat, especially with the kind of provocationsNoriega provided. His puppet assembly had declared a state of warwith the United States, and an off-duty American officer was shotand killed by his forces on Saturday.   Bush recounted the killing, the wounding of another Americanserviceman, the capture and beating of a third and threats againstthat man's wife.   ``That was enough,'' the president said.   ``Gen. Noriega's reckless threats and attacks upon Americans inPanama created an imminent danger to the 35,000 American citizensin Panama,'' Bush said. ``And that is why I directed our armedforces to protect the lives of American citizens in Panama, and tobring Gen. Noriega to justice in the United States.''   Bush had repeatedly encouraged Noriega's opponents to kick himout of power. He had said that Noriega was the problem, that theUnited States' quarrel was with the general alone and that hisouster would bring normal diplomatic and economic relations.   Yet when dissident officers attempted a coup on Oct. 3 andbriefly held Noriega, American forces stood by, inactive. U.S.forces had blocked two roads and had conferred with coup leaders,but the administration decided against intervention.   That drew protests from left and right, although someRepublicans complained that dovish Democrats who opposedintervention in other crises were endorsing it retroactively inPanama.   Secretary of State James A. Baker III said U.S. commanders hadbeen told they could offer support for the coup ``if there were anopportunity to do this without risking bloodshed and significantloss of American life and to do so without open militaryinvolvement.''   Those instructions ring with irony now that U.S. forces havebeen sent into open combat.   On Wednesday, Baker recalled his October testimony, and theadministration explanation of U.S. inaction at the time of the coupattempt.   ``I said if this administration chose to use force, it wouldmake its own decisions,'' he told a news conference. ``It would notact based on some unknown coup plotters' strategy or rationale.''   The toll of American soldiers killed in action early Wednesdaymounted into the teens and scores were wounded.   That is the price of using military power. It was Richard M.Nixon who spoke of the price of shrinking from its use, 19 yearsago. ``If, when the chips are down, the world's most powerfulnation, the United States of America, acts like a pitiful, helplessgiant, the forces of totalitarianism and anarchy will threaten freenations and free institutions throughout the world,'' he said,announcing he had sent forces to attack Communist North Vietnamesesanctuaries in Cambodia.   Bush was sure to hear told-you-so comments from those who arguedthe administration should have sent forces to join the October coup.   And Noriega's purge of dissident officers after that coup couldmake it more difficult for the United States to quickly completeoperations and withdraw the additional troops, which Bush said hewants to do as quickly as possible.   The newly installed government of Panama _ led by GuillermoEndara, thought to have won the May election Noriega annulled _will need reliable new leaders to take control of the military inplace of his henchmen.   Stability under an elected government will be the real test ofsuccess, whatever happens to Noriega. The administration has beenwagering all along that his support was thin and brittle. Americanintervention puts that to the test: If the theory is correct and heis powerless, Noriega is irrelevant.   But if Noriega or his lieutenants are capable of holding out andrunning continuing operations against U.S. forces and the Endaragovernment, the administration will have a major problem on itshands.   When President Ronald Reagan ordered American forces into actionin the 1983 invasion of Grenada and the 1986 air raid on Libya, theoperations were swift and brief. The Bush administration wantsintervention in Panama to be a mission accomplished and quicklyended. Prolonged involvement would stir political opposition athome and intensify the inevitable Latin American resentment againstYankee intervention, no matter the cause.   Bush sought to ease that backlash by saying he wants to get outswiftly, by lifting economic sanctions against Panama under the newEndara government, and by promising anew that the United Stateswill turn the canal over to Panama at the end of the century.</TEXT></DOC>
