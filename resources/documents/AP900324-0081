At least 195 people, mostly Moslem demonstrators, have beenkilled in the northern state of Jammu-Kashmir since Jan. 20 whenthe government launched a crackdown on the separatists.   State officials said four of the five people killed Friday andSaturday were Moslems. They were identified as a deputy policesuperintendent; the 73-year-old local leader of the Communist Partyof India; the grandson of another prominent Communist leader; and aman accused of being a police informer.   The fifth victim was a civilian, the sources added, speaking oncondition of anonymity. It was unclear if he was Hindu or Moslem.   The former state legislator, Mir Mustafa, was pulled out of hiscar at gunpoint Saturday near his home in Badgam, 12 miles west ofSrinagar, officials said.   Srinagar has been a focal point of the fighting betweengovernment troops and separatists.   Family members and highly placed sources in the government ofJammu-Kashmir said no group has claimed responsibility for theabduction and no demands were issued.   Mustafa was an independent member of the state legislature. Thegoverning body was dissolved in January when the federal crackdownwas ordered.   In December, Mustafa helped negotiate a prisoner exchange inwhich the kidnapped daughter of Home Minister Mufti Mohammad Saeedwas swapped for five prominent members of the radical Jammu-KashmirLiberation Front.   The front is one of several Moslem militant groups waging acampaign of bombings and assassinations to press demands for theindependence of Kashmir, a part of Jammu-Kashmir state.Jammu-Kashmir is the only Moslem-majority state in India.   The secession movement has been simmering since 1947, when thestate of Kashmir was divided between India and Moslem Pakistan.   The eastern part of the state is governed by India. The westernslice of Kashmir is under Pakistan's control.   The two countries went to war twice over Kashmir, and theirarmies still face each other along the disputed frontier.</TEXT></DOC>
