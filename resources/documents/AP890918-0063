The crackdown has forced emigres into acts of desperation. AnEast German man taking part in the exodus to West Germany drownedwhile swimming across the Danube River from Czechoslovakia toHungary, refugee workers said today.   The man was forced to swim because he had no travel documents,they said.   A Czechoslovak man today managed to cross his Communisthomeland's border to West Germany on a homemade motorized hangglider, Bavarian border police said.   The most direct route for East Germans seeking to take advantageof Hungary's free passage to Austria is through Czechoslovakia,which is sandwiched between East Germany and Hungary.   Wolfgang Wagner, head of the West German Maltese Aid Service,said that in some cases East German refugees have been forced offEast German and Czechoslovak trains and ordered to return home.   In West Germany, officials said today that nearly 750 East Germanrefugees had arrived in Bavaria during the night. That brings tomore than 16,000 the number of refugees that have arrived sinceHungary opened its border to the West one week ago.   East German officials have said that despite the exodus theywould not restrict travel for citizens wishing to visit Hungary _travel visas had been easy to obtain _ but ``more and more peopleare telling us that their visas are being taken from them,'' Wagnersaid Sunday.   ``Some have told me that state security had come to theirapartments to take the visas,'' and a growing number are forced toswim the Danube River or find other illegal means of coming toHungary, he said in an interview.   The 22-year-old East German who drowned in the Danube was thefirst casualty reported among the thousands of East Germanstraveling to Hungary.   The Czechoslovak man, a 39-year-old doctor, took off from avillage south of Domazlice near the West German border and flew,apparently unnoticed, over the heavily-guarded frontier to theBavarian town of Cham about 18 miles west, police said.   Border police, who did not identify the escapee by name, quotedhim as saying he fled to avoid reprisals for taking part in anillegal demonstration in Prague, the Czechoslovak capital, lastmonth.   Police in Hanover, West Germany said a 23-year-old East Germanclimbed over a border barrier to escape to West Germany's LowerSaxony state.   Police said the escapee arrived with cuts and scratches on hishands but was otherwise uninjured. No other details were provided onthat escape.   On Sunday, a 25-year-old man from East Berlin said he and 15others entered Hungary on foot after crowding into three cars andcrashing through several Czechoslovak border barriers at the Rajkacrossing, about 85 miles northwest of Budapest.   He said police in Bratislava, Czechoslovakia, took away theirtravel documents and at one point they were held at gunpoint untilthey promised they would not head toward the Hungarian border.   Also today, a Polish newspaper quoted West German officials inWarsaw as saying the number of East Germans who have taken refuge inthe embassy there has swelled to about 100.   About 40 more refugees seeking to emigrate to the West foundtheir way to the embassy during the weekend, the pro-SolidarityGazeta Wyborcza said.   Czechoslovakia and East Germany have eschewed the political andeconomic reforms sweeping the Soviet bloc that inspired Budapest'sdecision to open its border. Hungary's role in allowing East Germancitizens to freedom in West Germany has been condemned by thehard-line Warsaw Pact allies.   The Soviets have criticized West Germany but refrained fromdirectly condemning Hungary as Communist leaders in East Berlin have.   In Budapest, a senior Communist foreign policy adviser spoke ofSoviet anxiety.   ``It's a fact that there is noticeable worry on the part of theSoviet Union,'' Gyula Thuermer was quoted as saying in the VasarnapiHirek newspaper. ``They are worried that Hungarian events willbecome incalculable, and they are also disturbed that there are opendisagreements among their allies.''   Hungarian Foreign Minister Gyula Horn, meanwhile, said the WarsawPact should stick to matters of defense and not dictate ideology orforeign policy to its members.   Hungary is seeking stronger economic ties with the West.   Hungary's break with hard-line allies has won praise in the West,and West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher on Sundayproposed a West European aid program to support reforms in EasternEurope.   The total number of East Germans who have used Hungary forpassage to freedom since early summer is thought to exceed 25,000.Many fled illegally after Hungary removed some border fortificationswith Austria in May.</TEXT></DOC>
