There is, of course, no easy answer. Politicalinstability, limited track records, poor statistics -- theyall make gauging risk a risky business.</LP><TEXT>   But several companies try. What follows is a look at howtwo outfits evaluate the risk in some of the countries thatare receiving the most attention from foreign investors.   The two risk-raters:   -- Economist Intelligence Unit, a New York-basedsubsidiary of The Economist Group, London. A rating of A, or0-20 points, is the least risky. That's followed by B, 25-40points; C, 45-55 points; D, 60-75 points; and E, 80-100points. The ratings break down into three categories:medium-term lending risk, covering such factors as externaldebt and trends in the current account, with a maximum scoreof 45 points; political and policy risk, including factorssuch as the consistency of government policy and the qualityof economic management, with a maximum score of 40 points;and short-term trade risk, including foreign-exchangereserves, with a cap of 15 points.   -- International Country Risk Guide, put out by a U.S.division of International Business Communications Ltd.,London.   ICRG offers a composite risk rating, as well as individualratings for political, financial and economic risk. Thepolitical variable -- which makes up 50% of the compositefigure -- includes factors such as government corruption andhow economic expectations diverge from reality. The financialrating looks at such things as the likelihood of losses fromexchange controls and loan defaults. And economic ratingstake into account such factors as inflation and debt-servicecosts.   The maximum, or least-risky, score is 100 for thepolitical category and 50 each for financial and economicrisk. For the composite score, 85-100 is considered very lowrisk; 70-84.5, low risk; 60-69.5, moderate risk; 50-59.5,moderately high risk; and 0-49.5, very high risk.                                                                                                          BRAZIL's marks are improving, but it is still seen as ahigher-risk country than the other major Latin nations. Theeconomy is struggling to cope with a debt load of over $100billion and inflation that will hit an estimated 250% for1991. It also remains a fairly closed economy. However, thegovernment, unlike its predecessors, is eager to cooperatewith foreign creditors, reflected in a recent accord on therepayment of $8 billion in interest arrears. Moreover, Brazilhas been easing curbs on foreign investment.   EIU has moved Brazil up to its C category from D, givingit a total score of 55.   ICRG gives Brazil an overall score of 62, ranking it 54thout of 129 countries. Brazil gets 67 out of 100 for politicalrisk, 34 out of 50 for financial risk, and 23 out of 50 foreconomic risk.                                                                                                          CHILE is rated one of Latin America's least-risky bets.President Patricio Aylwin's government has cut tariffs andrevalued the peso to counter inflation brought on by a hugeinflow of foreign investment and export dollars.   EIU, citing Chile's vigorous economic growth, fallinginflation, and improvement in key debt ratios, gives Chile ascore of 25, an improvement of 10 points from April. Chile isat the upper end of EIU's B band and may soon be the onlyLatin country in the A, or least-risk, group.   ICRG gives Chile a rating of 70, ranking it 35 out of 129.ICRG gives Chile 67 for political risk, 42 for financial riskand 30.5 for economic risk.                                                                                                          CHINA is in the medium-risk category, though trade riskmay jump after next year if the U.S. rescinds itsmost-favored-nation status. EIU says the current-accountsurplus is expected to fall to under $1 billion by 1992 from$3.31 billion this year, reflecting growth in merchandiseimports. Tighter credit is expected in 1992 to prevent theoverheating of the economy.   The country continues to act as a magnet for Japanese andTaiwanese companies looking for offshore manufacturing sites,but Western investment has slowed after the Tiananmen Squarekillings in 1989. Economic growth is strong, and inflation isunder control. The obvious big negative: the repressivepolitical climate.   EIU rates China a B, with the worst area being politicaland policy risk, which gets a C.   ICRG gives it a composite score of 60, with 58 forpolitical risk, 24 for financial risk and 37 for economicrisk.                                                                                                          CZECHOSLOVAKIA looks far riskier than neighbors Poland andHungary as the government struggles with a crippled economy,a strident Slovak nationalist movement and erosion of publicsupport. Gross domestic product shrank 3.1% last year and isexpected to contract 7.5% this year and 2.5% in 1992.Inflation has soared as high as 60%. But the country ispushing ahead with sweeping economic reforms introduced inJanuary and is seeking closer ties with the West.Czechoslovakia's main asset may be President Vaclav Havel, aplaywright and former dissident widely admired in the West.   EIU gives Czechoslovakia a rating of 45, putting it in theC band.   ICRG gives the country a composite risk rating of 69.5,ranking it 36th. Political risk comes in at 73, financialrisk at 36 and economic risk at 30.                                                                                                          HUNGARY's risk ratings are improving, reflecting theimpact of wide-ranging economic reform. Although the countryhas a large debt of about $21 billion, private-sector outputis rising and some privatizations have gone quickly and well.Hungary is becoming a less-risky investment by EasternEuropean standards, according to PlanEcon, a Washington,D.C., consulting firm specializing in Eastern Europe. Since1988, Hungary has permitted 100% foreign ownership ofcompanies.   EIU rates Hungary 55, which puts it in the C category.   ICRG ranks it 54th, with a composite score of 62, made upof 68 for political risk, 32 for financial risk and 24 foreconomic risk.                                                                                                          INDONESIA is rated a medium-risk country. Though thegovernment of President Suharto is authoritarian, it followsconservative fiscal and monetary policies and has steadilyslashed restrictions on domestic and foreign investment inthe past five years. Chances of a rupiah devaluation now areslight, EIU says. Earlier in the year, fears of a devaluationhad triggered a wave of currency speculation and capitalflight.   EIU gives Indonesia an overall B. It has raisedIndonesia's medium-term lendingrisk rating to B from C,reflecting an expected improvement in the debt service as apercentage of gross domestic product.   ICRG gives Indonesia a score of 68.5, putting it in themoderate-risk category. But the country gets a relativelyweak 57 for political risk, reflecting rising discontent withauthoritarian rule and corruption. Indonesia chalks up astrong 44 for financial risk and 35.5 for economic risk.                                                                                                          MALAYSIA is generally rated a low- to medium-risk country.The government welcomes foreign investment and has recentlyrelaxed restrictions on foreign stakes in Malaysiancompanies. But rapid economic growth -- gross domesticproduct grew 10% last year -- is fueling inflation. Importsare expanding at a faster clip than exports, cutting thetrade surplus by a huge 56.3% last year to $1.7 billion.   EIU gives Malaysia a score of 25 and a B, or medium-risk,rating, for political and policy risk as well as forshort-term trade risk. As a medium-term lending risk, EIUgives the country an A, or low-risk, score, citing thefavorable investment climate.   ICRG grants Malaysia a composite rating of 77.5, a lowrisk. For political risk, Malaysia gets a strong 71,reflecting the stable government of Mahathir Mohammad. Forfinancial risk, the country scores a 45; for economic risk,38.5.                                                                                                          MEXICO's prospects are bullish, and the investment climatehas rarely been better. President Carlos Salinas de Gortariis pushing ahead with an ambitious plan to open up thecountry to foreign competition, and is aggressively pursuinga free-trade pact with the U.S. Inflation is slowing. Thoughoil income has fallen because of the oil-price drop, thedecline was expected and has done little to hurt confidence.   In its latest report, EIU gave Mexico a risk rating of 50,adding five points to the previous rating because of a highcurrent-account deficit. Mexico still stays in EIU's C band.   In ICRG's ratings, Mexico gets a score of 70.5 and a rankof 32. For political risk, it gets 71; for financial risk,41; and for economic risk, 28.5.                                                                                                          POLAND is further ahead with economic reform than mostEastern European countries, but is still seen as a relativelyhigh risk. According to a study by the Group of Thirty,Poland has lifted most restrictions on prices and imports,has devalued the zloty, has liberalized the banking systemand interest rates, and is planning to open a stock marketthis year. Outstanding debt is expected to shrink to $48billion in 1995 from $53.1 billion this year, with thedebt-service ratio dropping to 39% from 48%. The governmentis planning to privatize about 8,000 companies; the foreignshare is limited to 10% without permission.   EIU gives Poland a score of 45, putting it in the Dcategory.   Poland gets a composite score of 61 from ICRG, putting itin 56th place: 62 for political risk, 29 for financial risk,and 31 for economic risk.                                                                                                          THAILAND is perceived as one of Asia's most attractiveinvestments: Economic growth is strong, wages are relativelylow, and the government is hospitable to foreign investment.The country is once again under military rule after a briefperiod of democracy. The infrastructure is under some strainbecause of the economic boom, which reflects a majorrestructuring in 1984.   EIU gives Thailand a score of 25, putting it in the Bcategory. Political risk drags down the score.   ICRG gives Thailand a score of 68, ranking it 40th.Political risk is scored at 57, financial risk at 42, andeconomic risk at 37.   ---   Ms. Janah is a copy editor for The Wall Street Journal inNew York.   ---                     A Global Ranking                                                                                                          What follow are the International Country Risk Guide'sAugust rankings for 129 countries.
