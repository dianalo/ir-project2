This reportcovers the technology assessment and project development phases of theproject. Fixture and lamp costs are substantially greater for fluorescentsystems than incandescent systems, but may be offset by savings due toa relatively long lamp life and high efficiency. The higher the labourcost of relamping and/or the marginal cost of electricity, the more financiallyattractive fluorescent substitutes become. Upgraded emergency lightingand exit signs are two very cost-effective applications of compact fluorescentsystems. A discounted cash flow analysis was conducted to compare thecost of operating ceiling-recessed fluorescent and incandescent systemsover a period of three years. In general, fluorescent substitutes becomea more cost-effective alternative when the labour cost of replacing burned-outlamps exceeds $3 per fixture. The technical and cost analyses suggestthat, based on technical features and cost-effectiveness, compact fluorescentlighting systems should be marketable as replacements for many existingincandescent systems. 3 figs., 4 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
