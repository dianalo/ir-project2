However, prices finished well off session highs as themarket absorbed some profit-taking and futures-related sellprograms in advance of the April employment report.</LP><TEXT>   The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which rallied past 2700in early trading after some opening hesitation and peaked atmidday with a gain of nearly 22 points, ended with a gain ofjust 6.53 at 2696.17.   But the ratio of advancing to declining issues on the NewYork Stock Exchange weighed more heavily in favor ofadvancers than it had Wednesday, when the Dow industrialaverage rose 20.72 points.   In the latest session, 901 Big Board issues recordedgains, while 557 finished with losses. In Wednesday'strading, advancers outpaced decliners 864 to 612.   Additionally, broader averages recorded sharper advancesthan did the Dow industrial average in percentage terms. The30-stock average had a 0.24% gain. Standard andamp; Poor's500-Stock Index went up 0.33%, and the New York StockExchange Composite Index climbed 0.34%.   The Sandamp;P 500 added 1.09 to 335.57, the Composite Index rose0.63 to 183.97, while the Dow Jones Equity Market Indexadvanced 1.00 to 312.40.   Trading activity remained moderate as caution in advanceof the employment report, scheduled for release beforetoday's opening, weighed on the market. Volume on the BigBoard amounted to 145,570,000 shares, little changed fromWednesday's total of 141,610,000.   &quot;The market just drifted during the afternoon from a lackof interest,&quot; said W. Daniel Williams III, a vice presidentof trading at Dillon, Read andamp; Co. &quot;Something is keeping peopleon the sidelines, and that's really uncertainty.&quot;   The April employment data is expected to show that nonfarmpayrolls swelled during the month, primarily from the hiringof temporary census workers. The consensus of economistssurveyed by Dow Jones Capital Markets Report calls for apayroll increase of 384,000, with census employees accountingfor 211,000 of the gain, and an unchanged jobless rate of5.2%.   The Dow industrial average shows a gain of 51.12 points,or 1.9%, for the week and has moved higher in six of the pastseven sessions.   But in assessing the rally, some analysts have pointed toweakness in measures of the market's breadth -- therelationship between advancers and decliners -- as a signthat its gains might prove to be short-lived.   Gene Jay Seagle, director of technical research at Gruntalandamp; Co., said the market's latest performance represents &quot;thefirst sign of real improvement in breadth that we've seen insome time.&quot;   Mr. Seagle added that the evidence of buying interest in abroad range of issues increases the chances for stocks tocontinue rising once the market absorbs the employment dataand next week's $30.5 billion Treasury refunding.   General Motors rose 3/8 to 45 1/8 on Big Board compositevolume of 1.1 million shares. Although the company'sfirst-quarter earnings dropped 54% from the year-earlierlevel, the latest results were at the high end of analysts'expectations.
