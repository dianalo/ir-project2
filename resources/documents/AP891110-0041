The House and Senate conferees, who completed work on themeasure late Thursday, also agreed to $12 million for policetraining to the government of President Alfredo Cristiani.   But the police training aid was included only after lawmakersadded a requirement that President Bush report to Congress on theinvestigation into the deadly Oct. 31 bombing of the headquartersof a leading anti-government union.   Cristiani, of the right-wing Arena party, took office in June.Talks he initiated with the leftist FMLN guerillas fighting hisgovernment failed and violence on both sides of the 10-year-oldcivil war has escalated in recent weeks.   Final agreement on the overall aid package by the conferees sentit back to the House and Senate floors for final approval.   The agreement also increased the likelihood legislation carryingsubstantial aid for Poland's new Solidarity-led government could beapproved in time for next week's scheduled speech to Congress byparty leader Lech Walesa.   The bill includes $533 million in aid to Poland and Hungary, twoEastern European countries that have been on the leading edge ofpolitical and economic reform in the Warsaw Pact.   It also included $15 million in aid to the United NationsPopulation Fund, which would reverse a five-year policy of notfunding agencies that carry on programs in China, which has apolicy that leads to forced abortions and sterilizations.   President Bush has vowed to veto the bill if it includes thatprovision, but it was considered likely to be removed when themeasure goes back to the House.   The bill also contained another veto target, a provision barringthe United States from using foreign aid money to entice anyforeign government to carry out any policy that would violate U.S.law. The provision grew out of the Iran-Contra affair, whenHonduras was rewarded with expedited aid for its support of theNicaraguan Contra rebels.   In other provisions, the bill:   _Extended authority of the Export-Import Bank to subsidize salesof U.S.-made defense items to Turkey and Greece. The provision,pushed by Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., was designed tofacilitate a sale of Sikorsky helicopters to Turkey. Overall Ex-Imfunding was pegged at $615 million.   _Earmarked $35 million for the American Schools and HospitalsAbroad program, the same as last year. The program has come underfire as a ``foreign aid pork barrel'' that funds pet projectsoverseas of members of Congress.   _Set aside $20 million in economic aid and $43 million inmilitary aid for Morocco, which lobbies on Capitol Hill, but killedsimilar aid for Tunisia, Portugal, Malawi and Central America.   _Provided $50 million as the U.S. contribution to the WorldBank, but effectively froze the money until Congress is satisfiedthat U.S. commercial banks have made adequate concessions to writedown third-world loans.   _Redistributed the 23,000 metric ton sugar sales quota forfeitedby Panama under U.S. sanctions to Caribbean nations and Bolivia.   The measure included $4.7 billion overall in military aid and$3.2 billion in economic aid. The largest recipients of U.S.largesse are Israel and Egypt, which receive money as rewards forparticipating in the Camp David Middle East peace process.</TEXT></DOC>
