WILLIAMS</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Soviet Union's collective presidency, in arare televised session, unanimously ratified the U.S.-Soviet treatybanning medium-range nuclear missiles. A government spokesmandescribed the action as ``a very good prelude'' to PresidentReagan's visit.   Politburo member and Moscow Communist Party boss Lev N. Zaikovsaid the summit beginning Sunday ``opens up new vistas'' in armscontrol. ``The meeting inspires us with hope that even greateragreements will be reached,'' he said in remarks to the Presidiumof the Supreme Soviet.   The Presidium, a cabinet-like council headed by President AndreiA. Gromyko, voted after more than an hour of speeches by members ofthe ruling Politburo and other senior officials, including DefenseMinister Dmitri Yazov.   Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev sits on the 36-memberPresidium, but he appeared to be absent from the special meetingthat was televised nationally.   The Soviet action followed by only 17 hours the U.S. Senate's93-5 vote to ratify the pact signed by Reagan and Gorbachev attheir summit in Washington in December.   Reagan arrives Sunday for five days of talks with Gorbachev, andSoviet officials have been pressing for progress during the summittoward an accord to cut strategic missile stockpiles in half.   Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov hailed theratification by both sides as ``a very good prelude to the summithere in Moscow,'' and said the next step should be conclusion of astrategic arms reduction treaty.   Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze said the treaty ``putsthe policy of `new thinking' into action'' and will allow diversionof funds for use in the social sphere. ``New Thinking'' isGorbachev's term for his foreign policy program, which has alsobeen credited by the Soviets for improving relations between thesuperpowers.   Shevardnadze said the funds saved on weapons production wouldadd 300 million rubles ($508 million) to the budget this year alonefor non-military programs like environmental protection,transportation improvements and other services.   The foreign minister said the treaty was not the result of U.S.pressure on the Soviet Union, but a mutually beneficial pact thatwould advance stability.   Politburo member Yegor K. Ligachev said the treaty could heraldthe start of restructuring U.S.-Soviet relations, but ``there areforces in the United States and Europe opposed to disarmament. Itwas not without impact of these forces that the process ofratification in the United States encountered certaindifficulties.''   The Reagan administration had to fight off efforts byconservative senators to add crippling amendments that would haverequired reopening of negotiations on the pact.   Yazov, who was named defense minister a year ago, said ``wedon't have any doubt that without this treaty the Americans wouldhave continued to deploy Pershings... We would have had to takecorresponding steps, and the spiral of the arms race would havegone on and on.''   Genrikh Borovik, head of the Soviet Peace Committee, said at apress conference earlier Saturday that U.S. ratification was``gratifying'' because it came without crippling amendmentsproposed by Senate conservatives.   Reagan commented in Helsinki, Finland, where he spent four daysprior to his Moscow visit, that he was ``very pleased'' by theSenate's approval.   The treaty requires both sides to scrap their nuclear missilescapable of reaching distances of 300 to 3,400 miles. The SovietUnion has 1,752 rockets of that range and the United States has 867.   The Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty _ known as INF _was signed by Reagan and Gorbachev on Dec. 8, and contains the moststringent verification procedures in arms control history.   Reagan and Gorbachev plan to exchange the final texts of thetreaty as ratified by each side at a ceremony Wednesday.</TEXT></DOC>
