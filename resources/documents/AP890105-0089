Regina Boucault, spokeswoman for the Geneva-basedIntergovernmental Committee for Migration, said 3,510 Decemberarrivals at the Vienna transit center raised the 1988 total ofJewish emigrants to 20,082.   Only 114, or 3.2 percent of the December arrivals, said theywanted to continue on to Israel, Ms. Boucault said. For all of 1988,the share was 7.1 percent, she said.   Between 1971 and 1978, more than three-fourths of all emigrantssettled in Israel. In the past three years, the share had been atabout one-fourth before taking a new plunge in 1988 when Israel hadto cope with growing economic problems and a Palestinian uprising inthe occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.   In 1987, 24.4 percent of the total of 8,011 chose to go to theJewish state. Emigration was at an all-time low in 1984 with only904 Jews allowed to leave the Soviet Union. In 1980, 21,470emigrated. In both years, the share of those going on to Israel wasone-third.   The 1988 arrivals raised to 281,934 the number of Jewishemigrants since the resettlement program began in 1971. The largestofficial exodus, 51,328, was recorded in 1979, before the Sovietintervention in Afghanistan chilled East-West relations.   Most of the emigrants who do not opt for Israel go to the UnitedStates via another transit camp in Rome, where they receive languagetraining and undergo other procedures prior to resettlement, Ms.Boucault said. A small minority choose Australia, Canada and WestEuropean countries as their future homes.</TEXT></DOC>
