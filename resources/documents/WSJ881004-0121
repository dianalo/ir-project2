The company, which had sought a $12 million increase, said the department's ruling also lowered Boston Gas's allowable rate of return on equity to 13.25%, down from a 15.5% level in place since October 1982.    Separately, Standard andamp; Poor's Corp., prompted by the rate decision, said it placed Boston Gas's single-A-plus rated senior debt and A-1 commercial paper on its CreditWatch list with negative implications. Boston Gas has about $130 million of long-term debt outstanding, the ratings concern said.    Sandamp;P said the rate increase &quot;may not be sufficient to maintain credit parameters at levels appropriate for the current ratings.&quot; A spokesman for Eastern Gas said the company plans to meet with Sandamp;P soon to discuss the department's ruling, and said the company hopes for a satisfactory resolution. </TEXT></DOC>
