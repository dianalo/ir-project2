Pressure has been building within the cartel to raise itsself-imposed quota by more than 1 million barrels a day, a movethat some fear will dampen prices.   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the July contract for WestTexas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S., fell 9 cents toclose at $19.81 a barrel. Other contract months rose.   Among refined products, wholesale unleaded gasoline for Julydelivery lost 1.21 cents to 63.34 cents a gallon, while contractsfor later delivery also fell.   Wholesale heating oil for July, meanwhile, rose 0.33 cent to48.09 a gallon, as other contract months ended mixed.   Traders said activity on the exchange, which has slowedconsiderably in the last two weeks, was grinding to anear-standstill as the market turned its attention to Vienna, wherethe 13 ministers of the Organization of Petroleum ExportingCountries are gathering for their semi-annual meeting.   The meeting, scheduled for Monday, was to be preceded by ameeting of the cartel's price-monitoring committee on Friday. Eightministers form that group.   Analysts said new speculation that the cartel would raise itscurrent 18.5 million barrel-per-day production ceiling by between 1million and 1.5 million barrels set a bearish tone for the market.   ``Although the reports are not new, they make what we've alreadyheard more definite,'' said Greg Dreis, energy broker with MerrillLynch Energy Futures.   Crude oil prices have risen more than 30 percent from around $15last November when OPEC agreed to lower its production to 18.5million barrels from more than 22 million. The quota was to remainin effect for the first six months of 1989 to drive prices up to atleast $18 a barrel.</TEXT></DOC>
