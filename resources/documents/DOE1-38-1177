The uncertainties in the risk results associatedwith the consequences and their probabilities of occurrence may be consideredby representing the risk as a risk band. Studying the area and distancebetween the upper and lower bound of the risk band provides consistentinformation on the uncertainties in terms of risk, not by means of scalarsonly but also by real functions. Criteria can be defined for determiningcompliance with a numerical risk standard, and the 'weighting functional'method, representing a possible tool for testing compliance of risk results,is introduced. By shifting the upper confidence bound due to redefinition,part of the risk band may exceed the standard without changing the underlyingresults. Using the concept described it is possible to determine theamount of risk, i.e. uncertainty, exceeding the standard. The mathematicaltreatment of uncertainties therefore allows probabilistic risk assessmentresults to be compared. A realistic example illustrates the method.</TEXT></DOC>
