State Supreme Court Justice Jacqueline Silbermann ruled thatalthough Sandra Jennings lived with Hurt and had a child with him,a marriage did not exist, even during the time they were in SouthCarolina, which recognizes common-law marriage.   ``Absent proof of a mutual agreement to be married, an agreementto marry cannot be inferred from the fact that the parties wereliving together,'' Silbermann wrote. ``The contrary is true.''   She also said the relationship was illicit when it began becauseHurt was married, and did not become legitimate simply because hegot divorced.   The 14-page decision did not deal with financial support forJennings and the couple's 6-year-old son, Alexander Devon Hurt.Hurt currently pays $60,000 to $65,000 a year to Jennings and theboy. Before the trial, he refused to increase the amount andJennings petitioned for $16,000 a month, which Silbermann rejected.   ``I am thankful for the ruling received today, which is avindication of everything I have said.'' Hurt said in a statementissued by his publicist.   ``I felt that I simply could not continually give in to thepressures that have been constantly put on me for more and moremoney and other accommodations from Sandra Jennings and others,''the statement said.   Jennings' lawyer said he would appeal the ruling because he feltthe judge was ``madly in love'' with Hurt.   ``Let five judges who are all men decide this, not one woman whois impressed by a movie star,'' A. Richard Golub said. In New York,the State Supreme Court is a trial-level court.   Silbermann is ``so madly in love with this defendant, Bill Hurt,that we never could have gotten a fair shake. All her rulings camedown that way. If we had won, I would have been shocked,'' he said.   Jennings met Hurt in Saratoga, N.Y., in the summer of 1981 whenhe was 31 and a rising star and she was a 24-year-old ballerinawith the New York City ballet. Although she knew he was stillmarried to actress Mary Beth Hurt, Jennings began living with Hurt.They had a child less than a year later.   Jennings based her lawsuit on four of the 10 weeks she spentwith Hurt in Beaufort, S.C., during the winter of 1982-83 while hewas there filming ``The Big Chill.''   Some of Hurt's other movies include ``Body Heat,'' ``Children ofa Lesser God,'' ``Kiss of the Spider Woman,'' ``Broadcast News''and ``The Accidental Tourist.'' He won an Oscar in 1986 for``Spider Woman.''</TEXT></DOC>
