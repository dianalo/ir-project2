Murtha (D-Pa.), chairman of thesubcommittee.andM;The report said Army JUMPS was designed in the late 1960s.andP;  Although it hasbeen upgraded several times, it is &quot;inefficient and obsolete,&quot; the reportsaid.andP;  GAO cited Army documents that said JUMPS equipment did not interfacewith other systems and its programs were complex and difficult to maintain.andO;The documents also said the system was not centralized as required by DefenseDepartment policy, GAO reported.andM;The system suffered more than once from cost overruns and schedule slippage,the report said.andP;  In 1980 service officials estimated the redesign would becompleted in 1984 at a cost of $14.6 million.andP;  But as of last year, thetarget completion date was 1993 and development costs were estimated at $82million, GAO reported.andM;GAO also uncovered a number of management problems.andP;  For example, the reportsaid officials did not justify in writing decisions to delay programmilestones and increase costs.andP;  It also said officials did not adhere to DODdirectives and did not consider using commercially available software orexisting Army systems in lieu of the upgrade.andM;The report said the service also failed to submit the program for review bythe DOD comptroller as required for programs costing more than $100 million.andO;Army officials said they did not think a review was necessary because JUMPSdevelopment costs were less than $100 million.andP;  But GAO said Army documentsindicate total program costs would have been about $110 million.andM;Army officials told GAO last spring they thought it would not becost-effective to adopt the Air Force system.andP;  But GAO said the Army decisionwas based on a 1981 report that did not examine completely the advantages ofadopting the Air Force system.andP;  Still, GAO reported that both the 1981 studyand its 1984 revision said the Air Force system was more efficient and moretechnologically advanced than the Army's.andM;After the service failed to consider the Air Force system as an alternative,the House subcommittee recommended a $12 million cut in Army ADP operationsand maintenance funds, the report said.andP;  Less than two months later, theservice did another study that found advantages to using the Air Forcesystem, GAO said.andM;The new Army study concluded the Air Force system would meet 95 percent ofthe Army's requirements, GAO reported.andP;  It also said the Air Force systemwould save the Army more than $20 million in development, communications andmaintenance costs as well as $16.9 million a year in operating costs, GAOestimated.andM;In addition, the study said development of the Air Force system entailed lesstechnical risk, and it could be installed sonner, GAO said.andM;The Army tentatively decided to adopt the Air Force system in July, andCongress voted to restore half of the $12 million cut, the report said.andP;  Armyofficials made the final decision in November.andM;GAO said Army software maintenance costs will be reduced substantiallybecause software will be centrally maintained by both services.andM;The services also could use each other's sites to back up their ownoperations, the report said.andP;  It said the move is in line with the Office ofManagement and Budget's policy of reducing the number of unique financialsystems.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
