Their mission has become farmore difficult because of a double paradox that has developedin the wake of the revolutionary changes in Eastern Europe.   First, the very collapse of the Eastern Bloc has actuallyled to intensified hostile intelligence activities, withagents and operatives taking advantage of lowered barricadesto haul buckets -- full of secrets from West to East andelsewhere on the compass.</LP><TEXT>   Second, spies now operate within an expanding aura of goodwill and trust, with East-West distinctions becoming blurredif not eradicated outright.   The net result is that as the flames of espionage blazeall the hotter, the fire bell clangs on deafer ears. AndAmericans, because of their openness, are especially apt toget scorched.   What to do? In the August, 1990, issue of SecurityAwareness Bulletin, top-level security professionals fromgovernment and private industry concluded that securityawareness training programs need to reassess &quot;The Threat,&quot; asthe Soviet Union's KGB-directed activities have come to betermed. One author suggested that the term itself may beobsolete. The reasoning has to do with The Threat's source.After all, how threatening can security trainers expect athreat to be taken when its natal nation faces collapse?   Nevertheless, The Threat is still very much with us; it'sjust that rather than springing from a single country or evena bloc of countries, it is now generic -- a pervasive forcethat owes its allegiences not to a flag but to the highestbidder. A glance at The Threat's practitioners bear this out.Once gainfully employed spies now hustle their unique skillsas freelancers in true entrepreneurial fashion.   While exact figures are difficult to pin down, an articlein the March 13 Washington Times reported that spying inEurope is on an uptrend, with especially heavy activity incomputer systems and telephone networks -- fertile ground for&quot;hackers&quot; and communications whizzes.   An example of how this New Age espionage works comes fromCalifornia's Silicon Valley, where agents posing asrecruiters dangle (often outrageous) incentives to lureemployees to &quot;job interviews,&quot; where they are then pumped forinformation. So rampant has this practice become thatHewlett-Packard, for one, slapped distribution clamps on itscompany phone books to shortstop hostile interests fromlearning employees' names, phone extensions and departmentaffiliations.   Security awareness programs should reflect the morecorporate targets of today's espionage. Instead of showingmissiles being paraded through Red Square to frightenemployees, better to dramatize a single former Stasioperative purveying his resume to a competing company.   With The Threat re-defined, security officers can nextconcentrate on &quot;targets&quot; of espionage. Once predominantlypolitical in nature, spy targets also have changed. In orderto compete with the West and Pacific Rim nations, governmentsand newly formed private companies from Eastern Europe mustplay a high-stakes game of technological catch-up: In suchfields as robotics and computer sciences they are as much as20 years behind. Because intense Randamp;D efforts of their own areboth time-consuming and dearly expensive, many may find itmore expeditious to steal technology.   A Midwest company recently experienced just such a closecall, when a disgruntled employee from Eastern Europe (a U.S.citizen but with strong homeland ties) tried to flee thecountry with classified data on a system under development.He was nabbed moments before he was to board a Europe-boundflight.   Before a company's targets can be safeguarded, they mustbe defined. Data classification is a critical area ofsecurity that needs immediate reassessment. Here, the concernis not so much about obviously classifiable subjects, overwhich proper scrutiny generally is exercised. Of greaterconcern is the great, gray area of so-called &quot;sensitive&quot;topics. A U.S. Government term, it applies to data that arenot individually classifiable, but in the aggregate can addup to a classified subject.   As best-selling author Tom Clancy proved in his researchfor &quot;The Hunt for Red October,&quot; many of these bits ofinformation are openly available, especially in universityand research libraries. Others find their way to thetechnical and even general media as a result of the&quot;publishor-perish&quot; dictum in American academia. Closelyallied to sensitive topics are &quot;dualuse&quot; technologies;meaning they can be applied both to civilian and militaryprograms.   One of the best programs for handling sensitive anddual-use materials comes from the Department of Energy -- farand away the major sponsor of classified research in the U.S.The Department's new OPSEC (for &quot;Operations Security&quot;)provides for &quot;working groups&quot; to review technologicalachievements being considered for release. These are composedequally of security personnel and a candidate's peers -- acourtesy that is both tactful and practical, given thehigh-level intellects involved. It also provides for anannual workshop to which researchers and security personnelcan come to share lessons, exchange ideas and, supposedly,air grievances.   Even if private companies engaged in high-level securitywork -- whether under government contract or for their ownpurposes -- don't adopt the OPSEC model, traditional programformat dogma should be eschewed. For while it may be truethat The Threat still threatens and the Red Menace menaces,it's equally valid that you're not going to win over a newand skeptical generation by replaying &quot;Big Band&quot; film clipsto an audience weaned on MTV.   ---   Mr. Lamont is a Deerfield, Ill.-based writer and designerof security training programs.</TEXT></DOC>
