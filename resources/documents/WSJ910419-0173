GAO investigators, who visited Apache bases in SaudiArabia in January on the eve of the conflict, found that theArmy had decided to &quot;manage around the problem&quot; with a numberof desperate moves. These included the liberal use ofcivilian technicians and orders that virtually grounded some250 Apaches based elsewhere in the world for use as a sourceof spare parts.</LP><TEXT>   The management-intensive performance of the tank-killingApache, praised as &quot;superb&quot; and &quot;fantastic&quot; by top Armyofficials, raises multibillion dollar questions for Congressand for Pentagon planners studying the issue ofhigh-technology weapons purchases in the more tight-fistedbudgetary atmosphere of the mid-1990s.   Rep. John Dingell (D., Mich.), chairman of a House Energyand Commerce subcommittee that has been investigating theApache, has asked Defense Secretary Dick Cheney to assurethat still-secret battle data relating to the Apache will bepreserved so that the &quot;cost effectiveness&quot; of the helicoptercan be compared with the simpler and older Air Force A-10&quot;Warthog.&quot;   Despite the pampering, the average Apache helicopter wasavailable to fly less than 37 hours during the six-week Gulfconflict. While the Army says preliminary studies showApaches destroyed over 500 Iraqi tanks, the helicoptersappear to have been outgunned and outflown by A-10s.&quot;Warthogs,&quot; on the verge of being scrapped by the Air Force,destroyed over 1,000 tanks and were able to spend 3.5 timesas many hours over the battlefield, according to Army and AirForce statistics.   Richard Davis, who headed the GAO team that looked intothe Apache's performance, told the House subcommittee duringa closed hearing in February that maintenance crews &quot;did notsee significant improvement&quot; in a number of problem areas --including malfunctions of the helicopter's 30-mm cannon --compared to how well the Apache did during the 1989 U.S.invasion of Panama.   A copy of his testimony, made available to The Wall StreetJournal, says round-the-clock efforts to keep Apaches flyingrequired use of numerous full-time civilian techniciansincluding teams from Martin Marietta Corp., which makes thehelicopter's targeting system.   The Martin Marietta technicians replaced faulty batterypacks connected to the lasers that direct the helicopter'sHellfire missiles. The Army crews, according to Mr. Davis'stestimony, &quot;were surprised because they had no idea theremight be problems with these units.&quot;   The $12 billion Apache program fielded 532 helicoptersduring the 1980s. The Apache has been touted by Armyofficials as the state of the art in night-flying,high-technology weaponry. Compared with the A-10, which canonly carry four anti-tank missiles per mission, the Apachetheoretically is capable of much more destruction. It carries16.   When the Army was unable to get parts from the U.S.,according to the GAO official, it frequently took parts fromother Apaches based in Saudi Arabia. But the swappingsometimes didn't show up on reports that still listed bothsets of aircraft as &quot;mission capable.&quot;   Col. David Carothers, who supervises aviation for theArmy's operations and planning office, acknowledged that whatthe Army calls &quot;controlled substitution&quot; was used in the Gulfto borrow parts from other Apaches. But he insisted that anycommander who reported the readiness of both helicopterswould have been &quot;burned&quot; for violating Army regulations.&quot;There may be some honest mistakes out there,&quot; he added.   He said both Army and Martin Marietta officials knew aboutthe problem with the targeting lasers and that they werefixed before the war. And he insisted that comparing theApache's performance to that of the A-10 is &quot;comparing applesto oranges.&quot;   While the A-10s hunted for Iraqi tanks over thebattleground, the Apaches waited on the ground for Army scouthelicopters to find targets for them, he explained. &quot;Theamount of flying time that a guy spends on the battlefieldhas nothing to do with his battlefield efficiency,&quot; heasserted.   In its prewar efforts to junk the A-10, the Air Force atone point offered the Warthogs to the Army as scout planesfor the Apaches. The offer was rejected, according to Col.Carothers.</TEXT></DOC>
