It hasn't happened.   While things are far from rosy for the 53 musicians, they havearranged a concert season with guest conductors and soloists andlaunched a catchy advertising campaign that seems to be attractinglarger audiences.   The money isn't great _ but who joins an orchestra to get rich?And what's most important, said violinist Gary Goble, ``We arestill a very good orchestra.''   ``I think we know we still have hurdles. Sure, it's still goingto be lean for the orchestra,'' said violist Lee Yeingst, a memberof the new musician-run orchestra's board. ``(But) we really nowhave got our feet under us.''   The Colorado Symphony Orchestra arose from the ashes of theDenver Symphony Orchestra, which had accumulated debts of $2.5million and owed $700,000 in unpaid rent to the city of Denver.   The Denver symphony's troubles are far from unique _ orchestrasin Oakland and San Diego, Calif.; New Orleans; Nashville, Tenn.;Detroit; and Newark, N.J., to name a few, have suffered financialworries recently.   In the last two years, the Denver musicians' pay was cut, theconcert season scaled back. But this fall, when the board proposeda 1989-1990 season of just 11 weeks paying $530 a week _ down from$670 a week for 41 weeks the year before _ musicians decided tobegin their own orchestra.   ``It's unique,'' said Yeingst. ``You don't find an orchestrawhere the musicians accept the responsibility not only for themusic-making but the actual operation.''   Yeingst said the CSO is paying musicians a base salary of$22,000 for a 26-week season. ``If the gate is larger, they'll makemore; if it's smaller, they'll make less,'' he said. ``Nothing isguaranteed, just like real life.''   Rock promoter Barry Fey, who is helping to produce and bankrollthe new orchestra, is more accustomed to booking acts such as theRolling Stones. He admitted in September that he had never attendeda symphony.   Fey wants the orchestra off the society pages and ontoentertainment pages.   ``There will be some highs and some lows along the road, but atthe end of the year, we'll be fine,'' Fey said.   But Michael Maxwell, an administrator for the Denver Symphony,which is going through bankruptcy reorganization, said he sees manyempty seats when he attends CSO concerts.   ``Naturally we are concerned and disturbed (by the) very lowlevel of community support for those concerts,'' he said.``Patronage has been very low. It cannot be economical for themusicians.''   Yeingst said musicians did not expect sold-out houses andimproved paychecks right away. But ``we have been more than meetingexpenses, and with any successful fund-raising, any kind ofsupport, we'll be fine,'' he said.   Community support, however, is a problem. Yeingst said patronshave grown resentful over the years with having to support anorganization in perpetual financial crisis.   ``People now are simply not willing to write a check and let itgo at that. Those who are coming forward are interested to knowexactly where the money is going,'' he said. ``They want to knowabout costs, budget.''   The symphony's new fund-raising drive is aimed at the generalpopulation, from whom it is soliciting donations of $18.12, afterTchaikovsky's ``1812 Overture.''   The season opened in November with a ``Symphony Sampler''concert in McNichols Sports Arena that attracted nearly 12,000people. But a few days later, when the classical series began atBoettcher concert hall, only a few hundred showed up.   ``But after finishing our fourth week things look a lotbetter,'' Yeingst said. ``We're getting decent houses, and theywill improve. And we've had very favorable talks with the governorand the mayor'' about support for the new orchestra.</TEXT></DOC>
