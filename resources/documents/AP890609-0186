The vote was 14-1 with American allies Britain, France and Canadasupporting the resolution. In weeks of negotiation and argumentbefore the vote the United States sought first to block debate andthen to obtain amendments.   U.S. Ambassador Thomas R. Pickering said the resolution made``sweeping condemnations of Israel's policies and practices withoutany reference to any of the serious acts of violence by the otherside.''   ``It does not condemn violence from all quarters or affirm thatall parties have a responsibility to help reduce tensions,'' he said.   Arab League Ambassador Clovis Maksoud called the veto ``a majordisappointment. It indicates how entrenched is the U.S. bias infavor of Israel and how cosmetic and supervicial can be U.S.official proclamations of concern for Palestinian suffering andrights.''   He said the league had hoped the Bush administration was movingtoward a more even-handed position in the Arab-Israeli conflict.   At least 513 Palestinians have been killed during the18-month-old rebellion in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, and 22Israelis have been slain. Israel captured the territories fromJordan and Egypt in the 1967 war.   More than 50 speakers addressed the council in four days ofdebate. Most criticized Israeli tactics, which they said violatedthe rights of Palestinians.   Israel said the denunciations of the Jewish state prove aninternational conference on the Middle East would be accomplishnothing.   On Thursday, Ambassador Johanan Bein presented a litany ofPalestinian terrorism and guerrilla actions against Israel but didnot address Israel's harsh tactics in the West Bank and Gaza.   The Soviet Union, France and Finland said Friday an internationalconference should be held under U.N. auspices as away to begin peacenegotiations.   Ambassador John Birch of Britain said Israel's practices in theterritories ``ill become a state that was founded after so muchsuffering by its people, on humane and democratic principles.''   The United States and the four other permanent members _ theSoviet Union, China, Britain and France _ can kill any SecurityCouncil resolution by voting against it. Washington routinely vetoesmeasures it considers to be one-sided criticisms of Israel.   Pickering, who previously served as ambassador to Israel, ischairman of the Security Council for June. He said the United Stateswanted amendments to make the resolution more balanced, but theywere rejected by most members.   He said the United States deplored all violence in the occupiedlands and supported some provisions of the resolution. He said theUnited States agreed that Israel should abide by the 1949 GenevaConvention on the treatement of civilians in occupied territories.   ``The United States is deeply disturbed by the continuingviolence in the territories and we deplore bloodshed,'' Pickeringsaid. ``But the problem of the occupied territories can be resolvedonly through a negotiated settlement for a comprehensive peace''based on previous U.N. resolutions.   Friday's resolution ``strongly deplores those policies andpractices of Israel, the occupying power, which violate the humanrights of the Palestinian people, as well as vigilante attacksagainst Palestinian towns and villages and desecration of the holyKoran.''   It demands that Israel stop deporting Palestinians and ensure thesafe and immediate return of those who have been expelled.   Non-permanent members currently serving on the 15-nation councilare Algeria, Brazil, Canada, Colombia, Ethiopia, Finland, Malaysia,Nepal, Senegal and Yugoslavia.</TEXT></DOC>
