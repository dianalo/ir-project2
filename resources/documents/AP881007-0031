The police discovered that Mrs. Coughlin's purse was missing,``dusted the window for fingerprints and got a list of the contentsof my wife's pocketbook,'' Coughlin said.   ``As they were going out the door, I walked into the powder roomand put on the light and found the gentleman with my wife'spocketbook on his shoulder,'' he continued.   ``I don't know who was more startled,'' said Coughlin, 59. ``Iremember lunging at him and the next thing I knew I was on top ofhim. I was so angry.''   Police said they found Coughlin wrestling with the young man.   ``I guess it was my Marine Corps training,'' the congressmansaid.   Recco D.
