<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-25-1071 </DOCNO><TEXT>A simulation study was undertaken to examine the sensitivities of variousimportant parameters on the dry forward combustion enhanced recoveryprocess conducted on a field scale. Among the reservoir properties studiedwere pay thickness, permeability variation in the vertical directionand initial oil saturation. Variations in well pattern size and configuration,air injection rates and injection fluid (air or steam) were also examined.To determine the chemical reaction parameters for the simulations, acombustion tube test was matched with the simulator. A technique wasdevised to model the combustion process in a large field-size grid. Itwas found that the vertical permeability variation could be modelledadequately with three layers. Results from areal and cross-sectionalmodels were combined to obtain a three-dimensional analysis of the fireflood performance for each nine-spot field pattern. Simulation resultsalso show that the vertical sweep efficiency is predominately controlledby the vertical permeability variation in the reservoir, and not by steamor air override effects. The detailed simulator output showed that oilvaporization, cross flow between layers and heat loss to the adjacentformations are important in the thermal recovery process. 8 refs., 18figs., 9 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
