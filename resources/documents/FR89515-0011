After considering the comments received, the RegionalAdministrator has decided to affirm his decision to authorize the Commonwealthof Kentucky for the aforementioned program revisions. The following isa summary of the substantive adverse comments and the Regional Administrator'sresponse to them.<T3>Comment 1:</T3> The commenter objected to the use of an immediate finalrule to inform the public of the agency's authorization decision, claimingthat this procedure violated 5 U.S.C. 553.<T3>Response:</T3> In publishing the immediate final rulemaking decisionthe agency followed procedures authorized under 40 CFR 271.21 which thecommenter recognized. Not only is this regulation no longer subject tochallenge (see 42 U.S.C. 6976(a)(1)); the agency disagrees that it violatesthe letter or spirit of 5 U.S.C. 553. This regulation specifically providesthe opportunity for the Regional Administrator to receive, consider andrespond to significant comments before any decision becomes effective.This notice itself demonstrates compliance with U.S.C. 553. The opportunityfor commenting under the immediate final rulemaking (IFR) process is noless than under the standard rulemaking process, and provides the same30-day comment period. The immediate final rule process doesn't abridgepublic participation or public comment, but rather it permits the Agencyto accelerate the authorization process for state modifications.<T3>Comment 2:</T3> The commenter disagreed that the Kentucky Divisionof Waste Management (herein: DWM or Division) provides for public availabilityof information in substantially the same manner as would EPA, as is requiredby RCRA section 3006(f)(2) and 40 CFR Part 271. The commenter further statedthat in several significant respects, the state procedures for releaseof information do not provide access to information in as open a manneras do EPA's procedures.Specifically, the commenter asserted that the DWM does not provide fordisclosure of records in response to written mail requests for informationfrom individuals, but rather, requires that the individual travel to theoffice in which the records are maintained in order to gain access to them.The commenter also pointed out that in Kentucky the right to copies ofinformation is adjunct to ``the right to inspect records and as such limitsavailability of information for those who cannot travel to the situs ofthe records.'' The commenter also asserted that ``the state should be requiredto implement a policy of providing disclosure of records based on written(and mailed) requests, consistent with 40 CFR 2.108.''<T3>Response:</T3> Kentucky's Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) with EPA datedDecember 4, 1988, signed by the Secretary of the Kentucky Natural Resourcesand Environmental Protection Cabinet and the Regional Administrator ofthe Environmental Protection Agency, and Kentucky's Commissioner of Law'sStatement (dated November 14, 1988) both require that the Division providefor public availability of information in ``substantially the same manner''as EPA, which includes consideration of waiver of fees for informationconsidered to be in the public interest or contributing to the public'sunderstanding of the operations or activities of government.Regarding the commenter's assertion that the Division does not respondto written and mailed requests: the Division's administrative procedures(Departmental Policy Memorandum andplusmin;8711-05) provide that written,mailed requests are responded to when the request is specific regardlessof whether Kentucky form B-010-1 (Request to Inspect Public Records) isused by the requester. If the request is not specific enough to identifythe requested material, a letter is sent to the requester within 10 days(as specified in Kentucky's MOA with EPA) asking that the specific informationbe identified. If the request includes a request for waiver of fee, formB-010-1 is forwarded to the Director of the Division who either approvesor disapproves the request for waiver of fee and informs the requesterwithin 10 days. When the specific information has been identified by therequester, within 10 days the Division sends a cost billing to the requesterand a statement that advance payment is required. When payment is receivedthe information is sent to the requester and a receipt is made.The commenter is correct in asserting that under Kentucky law the rightto copies of records is adjunct to the right to inspect records (KRS 61.874(2).However, KRS 61.874(2) also states in part that ``Public agencies shouldaccommodate requesters whenever they can within the bounds of the efficientoperation of their office. Whenever only one item is requested, or a fewprecisely described items which are readily available within the office,and no special search is required, it will be more convenient both to theagency and to the requester to answer the request through the mail; torequire the requester to appear in person at the office of the agency insuch a case would not be more convenient to either party and would onlyinhibit the intended purpose of the Open Records Law.''Lastly, the State was not required by EPA to demonstrate equivalence to40 CFR 2.108 regarding the form, written or otherwise, that requests forinformation must take.<T3>Comment 3: </T3>The commenter stated that the State should be requiredto adopt and publish its policy regarding fee schedules, fee thresholdsand waiver of fees. Further, the commenter noted that the provisions of40 CFR 2.120(a) providing for a threshold of 100 pages without charge forcertain categories of request finds no parallel in state procedures. Andthat, under the Freedom of Information Act and 40 CFR 2.120(d), the costof locating and reproducing information in response to a request may bewaived if the agency determines that it is in the public interest to doso because the information is likely to contribute significantly to publicunderstanding of the operations or activities of the government.<T3>Response: </T3>The State has adopted statutes and regulations governingfees and waiver of fees for information at KRS 61.874(2) and 200 KAR 1:020section 3.(1) (ten cents per page). There is no ``fee threshold'' in theState of Kentucky. The State was not required by the EPA to demonstrateequivalence to 40 CFR 2.120(a) which provides for a federal threshold of100 pages for copying information without charge and sets fee schedulesfor cost of information released by the federal government based on federalpay scales. The Division has adopted language for fee waiver in the publicinterest deemed to be equivalent to 40 CFR 2.120(d) on page 22 of the currentMOA between the Division and EPA. EPA does not require the State to publishor publicize its procedures for availability of information, fees, waiverof fees, etc.; these are a matter of public record.<T3>Comment 4: </T3>The commenter expressed concern regarding the historicalperformance of the Division; that there had been repeated and chronic failureson the part of regulated industries in Kentucky to respond adequately tonotice of permit deficiency (NOD) letters and follow-up letters from theDivision, and, that the Division's lack of enforcement action or lack ofpermit denial condoned these failures or inactions on the part of industry.The commenter added that with respect to the Division's submittal in responseto RCRA Revision Checklist 6, the commenter is concerned with the lackof specificity in the state description of how it will address ``failureto qualify for interim status'' as provided in andSection; 270.70(b). Clarificationshould be required as to when the Division will opt for enforcement actionsto allow the deficiency to be ``cured,'' and when the failure to ``cure''in a timely and adequate manner will result in further enforcement action.<T3>Response: </T3>The Regional Administrator is aware of the Division'shistorical performance through twice yearly audits of the Division's hazardouswaste management program. It is true that in some cases the Division hasissued as many as four or five NOD's to industries before imposing penalties.At least one NOD is typically issued before further action is taken ondeficient permit applications. Minor permit infractions are not penalized,major infractions are penalized and no interim status is granted; wherea facility cannot meet permit conditions the application is rejected, thepermit is denied and the facility is required to close. Issuance of repeatedNOD's is a policy that current management of the Division rejects. EPAdeals with this type of procedural situation through its oversight rolerather than through the authorization process.With regard to the commenter's concern regarding lack of specificity inthe State's description of how it will address ``failure to qualify forinterim status''and clarification of when the Division will opt for enforcementaction or allow the deficiency to be ``cured''. The foregoing gave indicationof ``how'' this was accomplished. Note No. 8 in the State's program revisionapplication gives indication of ``when''; ``for example, a deficiency resultingfrom amendments of the regulations would be handled by allowing the companythe time allowed under the federal rules to correct the deficiency. However,deliberate or blatant deficiencies (such as illegal disposal) will be referredto enforcement immediately and would result in more timely enforcementactions than provided under the federal regulations at 40 CFR 270.70(b).''Kentucky has adopted EPA's RCRA Enforcement Response Policy dated October1, 1988 and is thus bound by the Memorandum of Agreement between the Commonwealthof Kentucky and the EPA to take timely and appropriate enforcement action.<T3>Comment 5: </T3>The commenter expressed concern over the alleged failureof the Division to provide for citizen participation in a manner consistentwith federal regulations. The commenter's concern is reproduced in itsentirety. ``The state handles the vast majority of enforcement-relatedactions through an informal process of notification, negotiation and resolutionthrough Agreed Orders. It is a relatively rare occurrence that a formaladministrative hearing or civil action is commenced to compel complianceor punish violations of the state program. DWM has determined not to allowan interested person (such as one directly impacted by the violation, ora person whose information led to the enforcement response by the state)to participate in the compliance process unless a formal administrativeproceeding is initiated by the cabinet, or after the disposition of a violationthrough Agreed Orders by initiating a formal hearing to review the agencyaction. The ratio of formal to informal dispositions is small, and thelion's share of enforcement actions are resolved behind closed doors inan informal matter. The results are decisions rendered often without completeinformation, and public confidence in the administrative process is eroded.Where informal disposition through Agreed Orders occurs, the public, inorder to be heard on the underlying violation, must file a formal challenge<T3>after </T3>the fact in order to seek to participate, and then mustbear a stringent burden of overcoming the agency decision and facing boththe violator and the state as opponents to such involvement. The state should be required to either open all Agreed Orders for publiccomment, or allow notice and opportunity for intervention of right priorto formal or informal disposition of enforcement actions in a timely mannerfor those persons with a ``standing'' interest and those persons whoseinformation formed the basis of enforcement response by the agency.'' Response: This comment does not raise a substantive issue that is relevantto the issue of the State's authorization. The Division has informed EPAthat its process of notification, negotiation and resolution through AgreedOrders is designed to get hazardous waste management facilities and regulatedindustry back into compliance with permit conditions as quickly as possiblein order to protect human health and the environment. There is no requirementin either state or federal regulations that allows public participationin the settlement negotiation process. In the Commonwealth of Kentuckyand at the Environmental Protection Agency this is an area of enforcementdiscretion. Because discussion of confidential or proprietary businessinformation takes place at these meetings, they have not traditionallybeen open to the public. <ITAG tagnum="84">Certification Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act </ITAG>Pursuant to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 605(b), I hereby certify that thisaction will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial numberof small entities.
