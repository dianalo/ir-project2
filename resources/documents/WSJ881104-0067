Shafer </HL><SO> </SO><G> CNG EXE </G><TEXT>   STRETCH RUN: The presidential race tightens, but an upset remains remote.    Even Bush's own tracking polls show the contest has narrowed in some key industrial states. Dukakis strategists now think Pennsylvania, Michigan and Illinois are winnable. They believe last minute momentum could put California in reach. But must-win Ohio is still uphill. And Bush aides say that despite some slippage elsewhere, the South remains solid, including Texas.    A Reagan-type landslide for Bush now is highly unlikely. Still, Dukakis has little margin for error. He woos industrial-state voters with populist pitches on imports, health care and education. The Dukakis camp prepares new ads showcasing his vow to stop aid to countries that don't fight drug trafficking. Bush spends some extra time in Ohio, but otherwise shows little concern.    One sign of Bush's growing confidence: After only rarely doing so, he now starts to mention Quayle's name.    SCANDALS STIR speculation about upsets in some House races.    Scandal-tarred Democratic House Banking Chairman St Germain is in deep peril in Rhode Island. Next in line for chairman of the critical committee are two septuagenarians: Texas' Gonzales and Illinois's Annunzio. After them is nonvoting District of Columbia delegate Fauntroy.    Among Republicans, Georgia's Swindall is a likely loser after a perjury indictment and New York's DioGuardi is hurt by allegations he got $50,000 in illegal donations. Sex-harassment charges damage California's Bates, a Democrat. But Democrats Dyson of Maryland and Chappell of Florida lead despite links to the Pentagon procurement scandal. Speaker Wright is unopposed, but uses campaign funds to pay his lawyer in an ethics investigation.    HOPES VANISH for the GOP to take control of the Senate.    Republicans abandon aspirations that a Bush tide would produce a gain of four Senate seats, enough for control. They now hope picking up a seat or two will send a positive signal. But Democrats figure on a net gain of one or two. Two barometers of Bush's appeal: New Jersey, where the GOP struggles to upset Sen. Lautenberg, and a closely contested open seat in Florida.    GOP officials grow more optimistic about retaining the Minnesota Senate seat and of Sen. Hecht pulling an upset in Nevada. They think Engeleiter is gaining in Wisconsin, though it may be too late. Although Republicans disagree, Democrats are increasingly optimistic about taking over a Senate seat in Washington state.    Both sides eye a Rocky Mountain upset: The best GOP bet is toppling Montana Sen. Melcher; an even longer shot for the Democrats is to surprise Sen. Wallop in Wyoming.    LITTLE CHANGE is expected in the Democratic-controlled House. Both parties predict a shift of no more than five or so seats either way. The GOP looks for gains in North Carolina and Florida, where Dukakis is running poorly. Democrats expect to win several open seats now held by Republicans. The most likely outcome, says political analyst Charles Cook: &quot;A dead heat.&quot;    DUKAKIS'S STRATEGY to win by carrying industrial states in the Northeast and Midwest plus the liberal Pacific rim was tried once before -- in 1916 by Charles Evans Hughes against Woodrow Wilson. Hughes narrowly lost by failing to take California. One difference: Hughes was a Republican.    BENTSEN'S REWARD: Democratic officials eye a party post for the vice presidential candidate. &quot;He's been the strength of the ticket,&quot; says one. Current party by-laws bar elected officials from being party chairman, but leaders mull creating some other prominent position for the Texas senator.    GUN-CONTROL SURRENDER? Massachusetts Rep. Frank suggests that fellow liberal Democrats give up efforts for tougher federal gun-control laws. &quot;It becomes an issue that drives away people who would support liberal programs,&quot; he says. &quot;Feeding the hungry and getting medical care for people who need it are more important than a seven-day waiting period.&quot;    DEMOCRATS DOMINATE in the battle for special-interest donations.    Democrats got about 62% of political-action committee money given to congressional candidates through mid-October. House Democratic incumbents draw over half of their re-election money from PACs; they enjoy more than a 30-to-1 advantage over GOP challengers. Senate Democratic leader Byrd criticizes PACs, but takes 64% of his funds from them. Bentsen's $2.4 million from PACs is a record.    Senate GOP leader Dole complains to corporate chiefs that &quot;pro-business PACs are perpetuating&quot; a Democratic Congress. But the GOP doesn't back up such gripes. Republican Senate incumbents are top recipients, too. California's Wilson rakes in $2.2 million of PAC money, and Minnesota's Durenberger gets $1.5 million.    The foreign-car dealers' PAC pours nearly $1 million into independent advertising for GOP Senate candidates in Nevada, Mississippi and Florida.    MINOR MEMOS: Dukakis staffers refer to Bush as &quot;Dr. Gentle and Mr. Snide.&quot; . . . Bushspeak of the week: The vice president promises to protect voters from &quot;narced-up terrorist kind of guys.&quot; . . . Republicans joke it isn't true that Dukakis doesn't have a defense policy; being from Massachusetts, it is &quot;one if by land, two if by sea.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
