The Dow Jones Industrial Average hit another post-crash high, rising 22.38 to 2635.43. That left the average needing to rise just 87 points, or 3.3%, to pass its record close of 2722.42 set in August 1987.    Yesterday's rally came after a government report said gross national product growth in the second quarter slowed to a 1.7% annual rate from a revised 3.7% in the first three months of the year. Investors figure that slower growth will prompt the Federal Reserve to continue to lower interest rates gradually and keep the economy from falling into a recession.    Volume on the New York Stock Exchange swelled to 213,680,000 shares, the highest since June 16, when 244,510,000 shares were traded in the latest quarterly &quot;triple witching hour&quot; session of futures and options expirations.    Broader averages that reached all-time highs Wednesday made still more impressive gains yesterday. The Standard andamp; Poor's 500-stock index climbed 3.94 to 341.99 -- equivalent to a 30-point rise in the industrial average -- and the New York Stock Exchange composite index climbed 2.08 to 190.22. The Dow Jones Equity Market Index rose 3.63 to 320.60.    Traders said second-quarter earnings reports, merger news, asset allocation and stock-index arbitrage all played a role in yesterday's gains and volume.    In the merger arena, Squibb soared 24 3/4 to 112 1/2 in Big Board trading of 3.4 million shares, and Bristol-Myers, the most active Big Board issue, dropped 2 3/8 to 49 1/2 on 4.5 million shares. A merger agreement between the two calls for Bristol-Myers to exchange 2.4 common shares for each of Squibb's 97 million shares outstanding. At yesterday's closing prices, Squibb holders would receive more than $118 of stock for each share held.    Other drug stocks that rallied on the news and were actively traded included Upjohn, which went up 1 5/8 to 33; Pfizer, up 2 1/2 to 63 3/4; Eli Lilly, up 7/8 to 63 1/2, and Syntex, up 1 3/4 to 50.    The product of an earlier industry merger, SmithKline Beecham, advanced 3/4 to 42 3/8 on 3.6 million shares. Marion Laboratories, which has agreed to combine its operations with those of Dow Chemical's drug unit, rose 1/8 to 35 7/8.    Stock-index arbitrage buy programs, in which traders sell index futures and buy the underlying stocks to profit from small, temporary price differences, kicked off the heavy trading in the morning.    This was followed by a large amount of buying by asset allocators who juggle their investments among stocks, bonds and cash. Falling interest rates generally prompt a switch out of cash and bonds into stocks.    Kenneth Spence, technical analyst at Salomon Brothers, said money flows showed the huge amount of cash pouring into stocks yesterday. He said $784 million flowed into the New York Stock Exchange, of which $634 million was in block trades. That's bigger than most other recent flows and is regarded as a sign of a heavy cash commitment by large institutional accounts.    Mark Donahoe, block trader for Piper Jaffray andamp; Hopwood, said a number of technically oriented traders also jumped into the market. He said stocks such as Anheuser Busch, United Telecom and Symbol Technologies appear to be breaking out of recent trading ranges on strong volume.    Among stocks in the Dow Jones industrials, Merck rose 2 1/4 to 77 7/8, and Eastman Kodak, parent of Sterling Drug, rose 1 1/2 to 48 3/4. Other standout gainers included American Telephone andamp; Telegraph, which set a 52-week high, rallying 1 1/4 to 40 5/8 on 3.8 million shares; USX, which rose 1 1/2 to 36 5/8; and Primerica, which advanced 1 3/8 to 27 1/4.    Security Pacific rose 1 1/8 to 51 1/2 on 4.2 million shares. Activity related to the company's forthcoming quarterly dividend swelled volume in the stock; also, the company moved to forge closer ties with Japan's Mitsui Bank by signing a letter of intent to acquire a 20% stake in Mitsui's California subsidiary.    Rumors that someone would soon disclose ownership of more than a 5% stake in Canadian Pacific helped send the stock up 3/4 to 22, a 52-week high, as 2.5 million shares changed hands. Talk of a possible restructuring also contributed to the advance.    Lyondell Petrochemical dropped 1/2 to 22 1/4 on 2.1 million shares. Goldman Sachs lowered its estimate of 1989 earnings by 9%, based on &quot;industry factors related to volume and margins,&quot; according to the company.    Sterling Chemicals fell 5/8 to 9 3/8 in active trading after its earnings for the June quarter turned out to be well short of analysts' forecasts. Other stocks hurt by disappointing quarterly results included Norsk Hydro, which went down 1 1/2 to 22; Great American Bank, down 2 1/4 to 10 1/2, and Allied Products, down 3 1/4 to 14 3/8.    But Digital Equipment rose 7/8 to 92 3/8 even though earnings for the June quarter were on the low end of expectations and the company cautioned analysts that results for the fiscal year ending next June will depend on the U.S. economy's performance.    In their first appearance on the Sandamp;P 500, United Telecommunications Technology advanced 3 1/2 to 73 1/4 and Tyco Laboratories gained 2 to 44 7/8. Typically, stocks new to the index attract buying interest from managers of index funds, portfolios designed to mirror the movements of a given market measure.    The American Stock Exchange Index set another all-time high by gaining 2.57 to 375.35. Volume totaled 14,790,000 shares.    Healthcare International plummeted 2 1/8 to 1 3/4 after a management group's proposal for a leveraged buy-out collapsed. Healthvest dropped 3 5/8 to 10 1/4; Healthcare International has a 9.8% stake in the partnership and would have spun it off to shareholders in the buy-out. </TEXT></DOC>
