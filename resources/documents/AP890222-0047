HIDLAY</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><TEXT>   Italian priests are leading prayers for rain, Argentina isrationing electricity and reservoirs in the United States aredropping as seemingly unrelated weather in several regions of theworld has led to drought.   The problem is critical in southern Europe, where about 25percent of the normal amount of rain has fallen since Dec. 1, and inthe South American countries of Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay,officials say.   In northwestern Spain, drinking wells have dried up in some townsin Galicia and potable water has had to be brought in by truck.Water is being rationed in other towns in the region. Weatherrecords in Oviedo, the capital of Asturias, show it's the worstdrought since 1876.   Electricity in Buenos Aires is shut off for up to three hours aday in different sections of the capital because river levels aretoo low for hydroelectric plants to operate at full power.   In the United States, the Agriculture Department's chiefmeteorologist, Norton Strommen, said a recurrence of last year'ssevere drought is unlikely. However, the Northeast coast has had adry winter and officials in New York and Boston are worrying aboutwater shortages.   Extremely dry weather has also hit southern Florida, and waterusage is being restricted in several towns along the Gulf of Mexico.Severe to extreme drought conditions are also persisting in largesections of the country's Midwest and West, turning the winter wheatcrop yellow in some areas.   Peter Newhouse, a cereal crop expert at the U.N. Food andAgricultural Organization in Rome, said the agency is worried thedroughts will hurt the world's grain production.   ``This year is crucial more than any other year because poor cropproduction in the last two years has brought stock levels downnearly to those of the world food crisis in the early 1970s. Anunprecedented 200 million tons are needed to re-build stocks to theminimum levels needed for global food security,'' Newhouse said.   Most of Africa, where large regions are perennially parched, isenjoying a relatively wet year, however, with replenishing rainsfalling even in the normally dry Sahel region south of the SaharaDesert.   ``Africa has been, for the most part, pretty good,'' says DaveMiskus, a meteorologist with the U.S. Climate Analysis Center inWashington, D.C. ``The only really dry area has been southernZimbabwe and northeastern South Africa.''   But along the Mediterranean coast of Europe, the skies haveproduced little _ if any _ rain since Dec. 1, forcing some cities inItaly to ration water and prompting priests to add weekly prayersfor rain to Roman Catholic church services.   Rainfall has ranged from less than 10 percent to less than 50percent of normal in Spain, Portugal, Italy, Yugoslavia and Greece,weather officials say.   ``Those areas along the Mediterranean coast should be gettingmost of their rain (at this time of year), but that whole region hasbeen extremely dry. Some parts of Italy have had no precipitation atall since Christmas,'' said Miskus, who tracks worldwide weatherpatterns.   Since late December, dry weather has spread north through most ofthe rest of Europe, with large regions receiving less than twoinches of rain and some areas less than one inch. The Scandinaviancountries, West Germany, parts of Poland, Scotland, Ireland andEngland have largely been spared from the dry weather.   Meteorologists blame the drought on a strong ridge of highpressure over central Europe since December, preventingMediterranean storms from forming or intensifying.   Yet while some regions of the world are enduring prolonged dryspells simultaneously, weather experts don't believe there is asingle phenomenon linking these events.   ``I don't think it has a unifying cause to it,'' said RobertHarnack, a professor of meteorology at Rutgers University in NewBrunswick, N.J. ``In any given year, with the world as big as it is,there are always places going in one extreme or the other. I have noreason to believe this year is any more abnormal than other years.''   In the southern Alps, unseasonably warm temperatures and a lackof precipitation combined to hurt business this winter for skiresorts, forcing some to close because there wasn't enough snow.   In northern Italy, fruit growers and ski resort operators haveasked the government for emergency relief funds.   Agricultural losses have been estimated at $1.5 billion as lowlake levels prevent farmers from irrigating their crops in severalregions.   Water rationing is in effect in several hard-hit areas, includingGenoa and Sardinia.   In the Sardinian city of Iglesias, residents receive water onlyin five-hour periods from Monday through Friday. In the northernport city of Olbia, residents who use water for non-domesticpurposes, such as washing cars, face fines of up to 1 million lire($750).   Crop production in Portugal has been hurt and governmentofficials have blamed the drought for increased food prices inLisbon. Reservoirs north of the Tagus river, running through centralPortugal, are only 28 percent full.   In Spain, forest fires have increased because of the dryconditions and have ravaged more than 4,048 acres of woods andmeadows in Asturias since Jan. 1 _ more than all the land burned infires there last year.   In Galicia, the region's legendary green fields have turned ochrebecause the region has received 30 percent of its normal amount ofrainfall from November through January _ the least amount of rain in30 years, weather officials say.   Farmers and cattle ranchers also are desperate for water in alarge chunk of the South American continent. From June 1 to Feb. 18,Miskus said, precipitation has been from 20 percent to 50 percent ofnormal in northern Argentina, Uruguay, eastern Paraguay, southernBrazil and southeastern Bolivia.   In Buenos Aires, night sports and music events have beencanceled, and hours have been reduced for subways and televisionbroadcasting. The drought has shriveled crops and forced ranchers inneighboring Uruguay to sell or slaughter cows because they don'thave enough feed.   ``Normally, they get most of their precipitation in the summer,''Miskus said. ``It's been almost a six-month drought down there.''</TEXT></DOC>
