NECTechnologies Inc., a unit of NEC Corp., already sells CDvideo games that include digitized footage of live actors andhuman voices. NEC's CD hardware player attaches to itsTurboGrafx 16-bit video game system.   Sega is Japan's largest maker of instore video-gameequipment and is moving to capture market share with its16-bit home game system. Victor is a major audio-videocompany which markets products abroad under the label JVC.   Victor and Sega expect first-year sales for their systemof two billion yen ($14.4 million). They plan to develop theCD-ROM system and introduce it for sale in Japan and the U.S.by mid-1992.

The companies said domestic sales of the CD-ROM systems,which they plan to introduce next spring, should reach 20,000during the first year on the market.

Broadening the newtechnology's appeal would be its ability to incorporate realvoices and video footage into a game.   The system will play a major role in defining&quot;multimedia,&quot; the combination and manipulation of graphics,text, video and high-fidelity sound.   Applications, the Sega spokesman said, &quot;are not toodifferent from a laser disk, but not exactly close either.&quot;Laser-disk players have been gaining popularity in Japanbecause of their ability to play back high-quality video andstereo sound.   The companies said they are licensing third-party softwaremakers to produce games and other programs. Audio programsfor the new CD-ROM system will be made by a Victorsubsidiary, Victor Musical Industries Inc.   Sega plans to offer a CD-ROM game system to be called&quot;MEGA-CD&quot; this fall. The company has already granted licensesto 27 third-party manufacturers. The system, which is beingdeveloped separately from the Victor linkup, will only rungame software.</TEXT></DOC>
