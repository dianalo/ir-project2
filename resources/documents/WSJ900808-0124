They must also consult theirlawyers to make sure they don't wind up in some criminalcourtroom.   The idea of laws limiting our response to a lawlessHussein figure may seem absurd, but the constraints are real.More than a decade of congressional micromanagement offoreign policy has produced volumes of rules limiting overtand covert action. Although military strategists and theirgovernment lawyers are understandably reluctant to discusshypotheticals, it's easy to imagine some of the legaldiscussions of the past few days.</LP><TEXT>   All proposed military actions since 1973 have had to takeinto account the ticking of the War Powers Resolution timeclock. This law limits deployment of forces into &quot;imminenthostilities&quot; to 60 days. At the end of this period, Congressmust vote to affirm the action or the troops must come home.Even if Congress supports initial deployment, legislatorsmight lose their enthusiasm over time. Military planners knowthere is no guarantee they will be able to implement anystrategy that takes more than two months.   Government lawyers have no doubt reminded the militarythat President Reagan's comparatively modest move of sendingthe Navy to protect shipping in the Persian Gulf led tocongressional demands that he abide by War Powers Resolutiontime limits. Mr. Hussein is canny enough to understand thathis strategy should also recognize the 60-day anniversary asa make-or-break date for Congress.   The Supreme Court should and probably would declare theWar Powers Resolution unconstitutional as a fetter on theimplied powers of the president. Unfortunately, this requiresa test case. Mr. Hussein reportedly studied law for a time inCairo, but even so he's unlikely to offer Mr. Bush acontinuance while the Justice Department litigates the issue.   Requirements that the president let Congress know ahead oftime of covert activities are also probably unconstitutional;the Federalist Papers stress that only the executive branchhas the &quot;secrecy, energy and dispatch&quot; to execute asuccessful foreign policy. This week's apparent leaks ofcovert actions against Mr. Hussein may be intentional or maybe the result of too many people knowing and talking.   Mr. Hussein's personality and appetite for territory havebeen compared with Hitler's, but don't expect any U.S. rolein any plot to kill the Iraqi dictator. In 1976, PresidentFord was faced with harsh congressional criticism of the CIA.In order to avoid even more restrictive legislation, hesigned a prohibition against assassinations, which PresidentReagan reissued in 1981.   Executive Order 12333 says that no one employed by theU.S. or acting on its behalf &quot;shall engage in, or conspire toengage in, assassination.&quot; This prohibition was partly blamedfor the failed coup attempt against Manuel Noriega before hewas finally apprehended. Panamanian officers had been told byU.S. officials that Americans could not be involved inanything that looked like assassination. This may be onereason coup plotters hesitated to use force against Mr.Noriega when they had the chance.   Sen. William Cohen (R., Maine) said afterward that theexecutive order was clearly at issue. &quot;If, for example, therebel officers had every intent of killing Noriega during thecoup,&quot; he said, &quot;then active support of these officers byU.S. personnel might have resulted in charges of theircomplicity in such assassination.&quot; Indeed, the understandinghad been that congressional interpretations of the ban onassassinations required the executive branch to warn aforeign head of state of any plan that might include hisdeath.   The Justice Department issued a new set of guidelines onassassinations late last year. The new interpretation isconfidential, but apparently identifies an exception to therule. This is that the U.S. can aid a coup that results inthe death of a political leader, but only when the death isnot the express purpose of a coup. This nice distinctionbetween assassination and death as a byproduct of a coupprobably conforms to the ambiguous demands in the 1970s ofthe congressional Church Committee. Its report called for aban on &quot;targeted assassinations instigated by the U.S.,&quot; butwould &quot;not today rule out support for dissident groupsseeking to overthrow tyrants.&quot;   Where there is no coup attempt, however, the broad wordingof the executive order probably prohibits any action thatwould cause the death of Mr. Hussein. Lawyers could craftarguments distinguishing between assassinations and killings.They might argue that a free-falling bomb from thousands offeet up is not the same as a single, targeted pistol shot.Maybe the rule is that a massive air raid that also killedmany civilians is fine, but any surgical strike against Mr.Hussein would be a violation.   As a matter of policy, it's a good idea to think twicebefore sending poisoned chocolates to Mr. Hussein. Rememberthe disastrous assassination of South Vietnam President Diem.And a threatened Castro may have had something to do with themurder of President Kennedy. The point here is that PresidentBush should be free to choose his military strategy withouthaving to worry about legalities.   Officials have good reason to abide by even the mostambiguous rules. Independent counsel Lawrence Walsh has shownwith his Iran-Contra prosecutions that even laws with nocriminal penalty can lead to criminal prosecutions. The WarPowers Resolution is not part of any criminal code, butneither were the Boland amendments. The executive orderagainst assassinations is not even a law, but it would be nosurprise if an independent counsel some day invented thecrime of &quot;conspiracy to violate an executive order.&quot;   There is something worse than effete about pretending thatthe law can limit decisions on national security. It demeansthe law to try to force the circle of the rule of law intothe square of an international battlefield. International lawwas outraged when Israel bombed the Iraqi nuclear plant in1981, but no one complains now.   More broadly, Congress should reconsider its post-Vietnamproject of writing guidelines for the president on howbattles can and can't be fought. Times and circumstanceschange in ways that rigid legal prohibitions can neverrecognize. In times of crisis, the War Powers Resolution andother supposedly legal constraints on the commander in chiefbegin to look like silly, and dangerous gamesmanship.</TEXT></DOC>
