Columbia's five astronauts, scheduled to begin their 10-dayflight Dec. 18, are charged with the task of retrieving what NASAcalls the Long Duration Exposure Facility.   The 11-ton, 30-foot-long payload carrying 57 experiments wasplaced in orbit during a 1984 shuttle mission. It was to beretrieved in a year, but that plan was scuttled due to schedulechanges and the Challenger explosion in 1986 that killed all sevencrew members.   The craft is falling from orbit and is expected to crash backinto the Earth's atmosphere in February if the Columbia astronautsdon't snatch it.   ``We hope that even though we'll be gone from our families andloved ones for Christmas, that we'll be able to bring back a greatbig Christmas present,'' commander Dan Brandenstein said Tuesday.   The other crew members are pilot James Wetherbee and missionspecialists Bonnie Dunbar, Marsha Ivins and G. David Low. Theyspoke at a news conference and in interviews Tuesday at the JohnsonSpace Center.   More than 200 scientists have been waiting years to see howtheir science, technology and materials experiments have faredduring the long exposure to the space environment. Such informationcould be used to build a planned space station or other long-termspacecraft.   ``The vehicle is invaluable to us,'' said the mission's flightdirector, Al Pennington. ``Almost every material known has beensitting up there in space being bombarded by atomic oxygen andother space materials for six years.''   Low said if the crew doesn't snag the satellite, it will be aloss to science and a blow to U.S. prestige. The crew will attemptto retrieve the payload on the mission's fourth day.   ``It's a completely passive satellite and no data has beentransmitted to Earth,'' Low said. ``So it's a complete loss of thatmission if we don't get it back.''   The chances of satellite chunks hitting anything on Earth areremote because it flies mostly over oceans, he said.   ``But I think it's poor form to let something like that comeback,'' Low said.   The crew also will deploy a Navy communications satellite.   To track down the old satellite, Brandenstein and Wetherbee willcomplete a complex set of maneuvers. Dunbar is in charge of using a60-foot robot arm to grab it and pull it into the cargo bay.   Columbia will follow another holiday shuttle flight into space.A secret Defense Department mission to be flown by a five-manDiscovery crew is scheduled to lift off Nov. 22, the night beforeThanksgiving.</TEXT></DOC>
