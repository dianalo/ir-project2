The test detects a protein associated with the spread of tumors,said Dr. Raouf Guirguis of the National Cancer Institute. Theprotein also has been found in patients with kidney cancer,prostate cancer and a nervous system cancer called neuroblastoma.   ``It seems to be in all the cancers we have screened,'' Guirguissaid.   Existing tests to diagnose bladder cancer, involving removal oftissue, pose risk, are often painful and sometimes do not detectthe cancer until it has spread and can no longer be cured, thecancer institute said.   But Guirguis, Elliott Schiffman and colleagues, whose study ispublished in today's Journal of the National Cancer Institute, saidtheir test can identify bladder cancer at an early, treatable stage.   They said they do not yet know whether the test will identifycancers other than bladder cancer at an early enough stage for themto be effectively treated.   Cancer will strike 985,000 Americans this year, according to theAmerican Cancer Society. About 49 percent of cancer patientssurvive five years after diagnosis.   More than 49,000 Americans get bladder cancer each year andabout 10,000 die annually, the cancer institute said. The five-yearsurvival rate is 77 percent.   The researchers are now using the test on volunteers from theNavy, the Army and in Egypt, where bladder cancer is a more seriousproblem, Guirguis said.   If these expanded trials show that the test is accurate, it canbe used as a screening test _ to diagnose cancer _ and as afollow-up to determine whether treatment has eradicated cancer.   ``The follow-up of these patients is extremely important,''Guirguis said.   Widespread use of the test awaits completion of the large-scaletrials in progress, Guirguis said.   The test is based on the detection of the protein autocrinemotility factor.   ``The protein is produced in the transformed or malignantcells,'' Guirguis said. ``We think it's stimulating the movement ofthe cancer cells and aiding their invasion _ metastasis.''   The researchers used a very sensitive test that allows detectionof minute amounts of a chemical.   Researchers hope to develop an even simpler version of the testthat would consist of a paper strip that would turn color if theprotein were present, Guirguis said. Such a test could bemanufactured for only a few cents per test, and could thus be usedwidely to screen people for cancer.   For some cancers the test might be used with urine, and forother cancers it might be used to look for the protein in blood.   Guirguis and his colleagues said in their report that inpatients with spreading bladder cancer the protein occurs at higherlevels than in patients with localized bladder cancer. And it isabsent in patients without cancer.   The researchers are trying to make sure the protein is notsecreted in the absence of cancer. They have determined that it isnot present during pregnancy or in inflammatory conditions,Guirguis said.   ``That's different from other tests that people have used,'' hesaid.</TEXT></DOC>
