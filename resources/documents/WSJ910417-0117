But it has madeM. Muzaffer Akpinar one happy bathrobe maker.   Brand new German and American computer-controlled loomssilently weave 1,200 bathrobes a day at Penta Tekstil A.S.'sbathrobe and towel factory in this gritty manufacturing townacross the Sea of Marmara from Istanbul. Penta's all-cotton,velvety-feel robes, in rich browns, blues and greens, sellfor $65 at J.C. Penney, Kmart, Sears and Montgomery Wardstores in the U.S.</LP><TEXT>   Penta shipped 240,000 bathrobes to the U.S. last yearunder Turkey's import quota of two million. But now, in thefirst tangible gain Turkey can claim from its pro-coalitionstand, the U.S. is nearly doubling quotas on Turkishbathrobes and some other textile items. Mr. Akpinar, Penta'ssales manager, says he will ship $7 million worth of robes tothe U.S. this year, up 40% from last year, and hopes todouble sales next year.   Permission to sell more bathrobes to J.C. Penney is a farcry from the sweeping economic and political gains Turkey hadhoped to reap from its early and courageous cooperation withthe U.S.-led effort to liberate Kuwait. Only days after theinvasion, Turkish President Turgut Ozal shut off two Iraqioil pipelines through Turkey. He later allowed U.S. warplanesto fly hundreds of sorties against targets in northern Iraqfrom NATO bases in eastern Turkey and kept 100,000 troopsmassed along the border to tie down Iraqi divisions on theother side.   It was a risky decision. Political opponents hope tocapitalize on discontent over the Gulf gamble by toppling Mr.Ozal's Motherland Party in legislative elections due to beginnext year. Mr. Ozal would remain president even if the partyhe founded lost the vote, but his position would be weakened.Radical Islamic fundamentalists also hope to exploit economicdiscontent.   It wasn't supposed to be this way. Mr. Ozal chose thewinning side in the war and that's good news for him, ofcourse. But he expected -- and promised Turks -- too much inreturn for his stand: billions of dollars to compensate forTurkey's financial losses, enough political capital tounblock Turkey's stalled application for membership in theEuropean Community, and a powerful role for Turkey in MiddleEast diplomacy. In the local press, Mr. Ozal pledged evenmore: that financial returns would compensate Turkeythreefold.   He remains publicly optimistic. In an interview in thepink-stucco presidential palace in Ankara, as Kurds continueto pour across the border and Saddam Hussein remains in powerin Baghdad, Mr. Ozal still maintains that &quot;Turkey has comeout of this crisis very well.&quot;   But when pressed, he acknowledges that expectationshaven't been matched by reality -- especially the responsesof Europe and the Gulf states. Others are much more downbeatthan that. &quot;Ozal said for every dollar we lost we'd get threeback,&quot; says Hikmet Cetin, general secretary of the SocialDemocratic Populist Party, one of the leading oppositionparties. &quot;Instead, we lost $7 billion and got back 250,000Kurds.'   Overall, declares Mr. Cetin, &quot;We have got nothing. Zero.&quot;   Critics say Mr. Ozal unnecessarily raised hopes thatTurks' participation alongside the U.S. would bring monetarygain to a struggling economy. &quot;Ozal was guilty of building upunjustified expectations,&quot; says a foreign diplomat. &quot;Ratherthan basing his truly courageous stance on national security,he laid out for his people a mercantile balance sheet thatwas unseemly.&quot;   Instead, Turkey's economy is in even worse shape now.Shutting off the Iraqi pipeline cost $2.5 billion in lostfees. The loss of contracts inside Iraq cost $1 billion. Thecollapse of tourism and loss of lucrative Gulf export marketsbecause of the war cost another $3.5 billion, Turkishofficials estimate. And caring for thousands of Kurds couldcost millions more.   Turkey's current-account deficit (which includes trade ingoods and services plus certain financial transfers) hasballooned to more than $2.5 billion. Inflation, which hadbeen easing down to around a 50% annual rate, is more than75%, partly because of war-related spending. The central bankspent $2 billion of Turkey's $11 billion in reserves to meetcurrent bills. Turkish Airlines workers recently went onstrike demanding a pay increase of 680%; the state offeredthem a paltry 300%.   So far, tourists haven't returned, the pipeline from Iraqis still shut and the impact of lower oil prices hasn't yettranslated into lower inflation.   Signs of economic devastation are everywhere. EdouardSpeck, general manager of the Swissotel Bosphorus, agleaming, glass-fronted 503-room hotel in Istanbul, fussesover the sumptuous lunchtime buffet served to a handful ofbusinessmen in the hotel's glass and marble dining room.&quot;We're lucky we only have 150 rooms ready,&quot; he says.   Mr. Speck says Istanbul's business hotels, normally packedto 95% occupancy, are hovering around 40% occupancy now.While he doesn't expect to see many tourists this year, Mr.Speck hopes business travel will gradually pick up.Meanwhile, he's still planning the gala opening of his hugeand glittering ballroom on Turkey's National Day, April 23,with a lavish Miss Turkey beauty pageant.   Across town at the mammoth Covered Bazaar, tourists are asscarce as bargains. Stall-keepers pounce on an Americanbackpacker and a bewildered British family. Scores ofBulgarian tourists pass by, but don't buy much. In a narrowstreet around the back of the bazaar, four men with portabletelephones staff Istanbul's off-floor gold and currencyfutures market. While activity seems to swirl, even here fewtransactions are actually being made.   Circumstances conspire to put Turkey in a less favorableposition than some other coalition participants. Bankers say,for example, that most of Turkey's $43 billion in foreigndebt is owed to private banks rather than to governments, soit couldn't benefit as Egypt did from a $7 billion write-offof U.S. government loans. Mr. Ozal came back from a visit tothe U.S. last month with only $200 million in direct aid, butthe Bush administration will ask Congress for $700 million inmilitary and economic aid for Turkey next year.   Mr. Ozal now says he never expected to get all $7 billionback. But he does expect the $4.5 billion that has beenpledged, mainly by Japan, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia; so far,only $1.3 billion has arrived.   Hasan Cemal, editor of the daily Cumhuriyet newspaper,thinks official pique at slow-paying Gulf countries was thereason government-controlled television recently showed themovie &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot; for the first time in 20 years.&quot;This is seen here as an anti-Arab movie,&quot; says Mr. Cemal.&quot;So they're sending the Arabs a message: Pay up.&quot;   Many Turks are starting to feel let down. &quot;If theincreased textile quotas are all we get, Turkey will be very,very disappointed,&quot; says Bulent Eczacibasi, a supporter ofMr. Ozal's policies who is chairman of the TurkishIndustrialists and Businessmen's Association in Istanbul. &quot;Weneed cash now. The burden that fell on Turkey needs to beeased.&quot;   As a means of easing that burden, Mr. Ozal has suggestedthat Turkey somehow join the proposed U.S.-Canada-MexicoNorth American free trade zone, a suggestion that has evokedpuzzled stares in Washington, on geographic grounds ifnothing else. Mr. Ozal says he only meant the U.S. shoulddrop all tariffs and barriers to trade with Turkey. Heconcedes, though, that nothing will be done for Turkey beforethe U.S. decides on a Mexican pact, currently a contentiousissue in Congress.   Mr. Ozal's and Turkey's major disappointment is withEurope. &quot;What's not come up to our expectations is mainly onthe European side,&quot; Mr. Ozal says. The EC has so far givenTurkey only about $231 million in emergency aid. Turkey askedEurope to raise its textile quotas by 35% and got an offer of15%. A further EC aid package of about $732 million that longpre-dates the Gulf crisis is still being blocked by a Greekveto.   As for full EC membership, even though Turkey is thelongest-pending applicant, it is unlikely to be admittedbefore Austria and possibly even Poland, Hungary andCzechoslovakia. Mr. Ozal had hoped the fallout from the Gulfcrisis would ease Turkey's path in Europe, but &quot;it hasn't,&quot;he says. The EC says high-inflation, low-income Turkey isn'tready to join. Mr. Ozal thinks the EC isn't ready for amember whose population is 98% Muslim.   What Turkey has gained is security. It has seen Iraq, apowerful and troublesome neighbor, humbled and its militarymight destroyed. Turkey's 800,000-man army now is the biggestin the region. The Bush administration is helping to improveTurkey's firepower: The U.S. will leave in Turkey at leasttwo Patriot anti-missile batteries provided during the war,and may send as many as eight more. The U.S. also will giveTurkey 40 F-4E fighter planes, and has pledged to helpestablish a Turkish Defense Fund, to be financed by variouscountries, to help upgrade the Turkish military.   And Mr. Ozal pledges to push ahead with his ambitious planto modernize and Westernize the economy no matter how much orhow little help he gets. &quot;We're in a stage of transformation,which will take more than a few years, from an EasternEuropean-like command economy to the free market,&quot; Mr. Ozalsays.   That transformation will require thousands of young Turkslike Mr. Akpinar of Penta -- who at the age of 29 owns apiece of his company -- to produce high-quality goods likebathrobes for export. On the wall outside Mr. Akpinar'soffice in Bursa hangs a photo of Mr. Ozal cutting the ribbonto open the $5 million Penta plant two years ago. &quot;Ozal lovesmedium-size, clean, export-oriented industries,&quot; says Mr.Akpinar. Adds Penta Chairman H. Murat Vargi: &quot;If you open asteel mill, Ozal won't come.&quot;   Mr. Vargi, who thinks the higher textile quotas willeventually pay off for Turkey even more than short-termfinancial aid, nonetheless says the country is sufferingright now. &quot;Nobody is thanking Turkey or Ozal for what wedid,&quot; Mr. Vargi says. &quot;He's getting flak on all sides athome, and he doesn't deserve this much criticism.&quot;   Adds a foreign diplomat in Ankara: &quot;Ozal's got to bedisappointed with the way things turned out. Saddam is stillthere, the Kurds are at his door, and the bills haven't beenpaid. This is not what he had in mind at all.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
