The national Media General-Associated Press survey found that amajority backed U.S. military strikes against countries that supportterrorists only if the support were proved and innocent civilianswere not killed.   The poll found opinion sharply divided on whether militaryretaliation would deter terrorists or spur them. But a majority saidthe government can stem terrorism, and 57 percent said it is notdoing enough now.   The survey of 1,162 adults had a 3-point margin of error. It wasconducted Jan. 4-12, after a terrorist bomb downed Pan Am Flight 103over Scotland, killing 270 people.   In response to the bombing, the Federal Aviation Administrationordered U.S. airlines to X-ray all checked baggage on flights fromEurope and the Mideast. The poll found support for other steps, someconsiderably tougher:   _Ninety-six percent said foreign airlines should be required toX-ray checked baggage.   _Nearly three-quarters favored requiring airlines to hand-searchall checked baggage on international flights, even if that meantpassengers had to check in three hours early. That is the practiceon El Al, Israel's airline, which has long experience inanti-terrorism efforts.   _Half of those polled supported banning carry-on luggage oninternational flights. Such a ban has been used sporadically byBritish Airways on flights into Belfast, Northern Ireland, duringtimes of political tension.   The survey also found some sentiment for greater publicdisclosure of terrorist threats against airlines, even if thethreats are frequent and unverifiable.   That issue arose when it was revealed that U.S. officials hadbeen warned before the Pan Am attack that a bombing was imminent,but did not publicly reveal the threat. Officials said later thatannouncing the threats could cripple the airline industry becausewarnings virtually are received daily.   Respondents were split evenly on the question. Asked if thegovernment should announce all terrorist threats it receives againstairlines, even if it gets them daily and cannot tell if they arelegitimate, 45 percent said yes, 45 percent said no. The restweren't sure.   However, 57 percent said the airlines should be required toannounce all terrorist threats they receive. Thirty-eight percentopposed such a requirement; the rest had no opinion.   Even with their support for tougher security and disclosure byairlines of threats, respondents did not view terrorism as the chiefdanger to air travelers. A solid 64 percent said inadequatemaintenance poses a greater danger, while just 24 percent choseterrorism as the greater hazard. Twelve percent had no opinion.   On military responses to terrorism, 55 percent said the UnitedStates should strike against other nations if it has proof theysupported terrorists who attacked Americans. That sentiment spannedideologies, but was backed more strongly by men, 64 percent, thanwomen, 45 percent.   Still, nearly a third of those who supported military strikessaid they would change their view if the action might kill innocentpeople. That left just 33 percent overall favoring retaliatorystrikes in which civilians could die.   Moreover, an overwhelming 84 percent opposed military retaliationif the United States lacked direct proof of another nation'sinvolvement, even if U.S. officials believed the other country wasinvolved.   Opinion was split on the efficacy of military retaliation. Nearlyone-third said striking countries that support terrorism would onlyincrease the number of terrorist attacks, while a third said itwould be a deterrent. The rest either said it would have no effector had no opinion.   Nonetheless, 61 percent said the United States can take steps toreduce terrorist attacks significantly, and only 31 percent said thegovernment is doing all it can now to protect Americans fromterrorism.
