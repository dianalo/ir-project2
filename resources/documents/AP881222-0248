Bilzerian claims hisfederal indictment on charges stemming from the government'ssweeping investigation of Wall Street corruption is the result ofoverzealous prosecution.   Bilzerian, who acquired the defense contractor Singer Co. earlierthis year following a hostile battle, has been indicted on federalcharges of lying to the government and illegally hiding stock inconnection with four multimillion-dollar transactions in 1985 and1986.   The 12-count indictment announced Wednesday against the38-year-old St. Petersburg, Fla. resident was the latest outgrowthof investigations indirectly linked to the Ivan Boesky insidertrading scandal.   Manhattan U.S. Attorney Rudolph Giuliani revealed the indictmenthours before he announced a tentative settlement of criminal chargeswith the investment firm Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. that alsostemmed from the Boesky case.   Giuliani said the probe of Bilzerian's activities was continuing,but the prosecutor declined to identify anyone else who might beinvolved.   Bilzerian immediately denied wrongdoing in a statement issuedthrough his lawyer Arthur Mathews, and blamed the indictment on whathe called prosecutors seizing on the growing public concern aboutcorporate takeovers.   ``I believe this indictment is the price I am paying for havingbecome publicly identified with takeovers _ a business activityconcerning which the prosecutors in New York appear to have lost allperspective,'' he said.   A one-time real estate investor who has made runs on several bigcompanies, Bilzerian took control of Singer in February after a$1.06 billion takeover struggle. He has since been busy sellingpieces of Singer, which is based in Stamford, Conn.   Singer was not among the transactions mentioned in theindictment, which concerned Bilzerian's attempted takeover ofCluett, Peabody and Co.; alleged ownership of 58,000 shares of H.H.Robertson Co.; attempted takeover of Hammermill Paper Co. andalleged ownership of 306,600 shares of Armco Steel.   In the Cluett transaction, the indictment said Bilzerian lied inclaiming he used $20 million of his own money to finance hispurchase of Cluett stock, ``when in fact he primarily used moneythat he had raised from a small group of wealthy businessmen.'' Hemade a $7 million profit by later selling the stock.   The indictment further alleged Bilzerian illegally hid ownershipof 58,000 shares of H.H. Robertson by selling it to the LosAngeles-based brokerage Jefferies andamp; Co., with the understanding thathe would buy it back later.   This activity, commonly known as ``stock parking,'' can be usedto avoid Securities and Exchange Commission reporting requirementsand acquire stock positions in companies without disclosing thempublicly.   Stock parking, conspiracy and filing fraudulent statements werefurther alleged in Bilzerian's accumulation of stock in HammermillPaper and Armco, also done in concert with Jefferies. The indictmentsaid Bilzerian made a $58 million profit by later selling hisHammermill stake.   Each count carries a maximum five years in prison and $250,000 infines upon conviction. He is scheduled to be arraigned at federalcourt in Manhattan Dec. 29.   There had been persistent speculation prior to the indictmentthat Bilzerian was under investigation for his role in some of thesetransactions, based on evidence supplied partly by Boyd L.Jefferies, founder of the brokerage that bears his name.   Jefferies has been cooperating with government investigatorssince he was implicated in securities fraud by Boesky, thenow-imprisoned speculator who turned state's evidence after payingthe government a record $100 million fine for insider trading twoyears ago.   Jefferies's cooperation also has played a major role in at leasttwo other securities fraud indictments this year.   Last July, a Manhattan grand jury indicted GAF Corp., its vicechairman and two subsidiaries on stock manipulation charges after afailed attempt to acquire the company. Last month, a federal grandjury indicted Salim B. Lewis, a well-known takeover speculator, onstock manipulation charges.</TEXT></DOC>
