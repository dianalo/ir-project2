The 1986 surplus totaled $360,000, said excerpts of the reportthat were circulated by the official Saudi Press Agency.   The big increase followed a major effort by the Saudis todiversify their economy away from dependence on oil revenues. Theyhave developed agriculture, wheat and food products for export, aswell as domestic consumption.   The ministry report said exports totalled $22.56 billion lastyear and imports $20 billion.   In 1986 exports totaled $19.24 billion with imports pegged at$18.88 billion, the report said.   The Saudi news agency did not provide any breakdown of exportfigures and gave only a partial list of import statistics.   The Finance Ministry report showed 81.2 percent of Saudi Arabia'simports last year came from 15 countries, headed by Japan, theUnited States, Britain, West Germany and Italy.   Imports from Arab League states last year increased by 8.6percent over the preceding year, while imports from non-Arab Islamicstates increased by 9.8 percent.   The oil-rich kingdom's major import categories all rose lastyear, at least in value. The agency report only cited import values.   They were listed as foodstuffs and livestock, which increased by7.2 percent in value, beverages and tobacco by 12 percent, rawmaterials by 21.6 percent, vegetable oils and fats by 10.4 percent,machinery and transport equipment by 2.1 percent, furniture,clothing and shoes by 5.7 percent.   Saudi Arabia sits on almost one-third of the world's proven oilreserves, but has been hard hit by a weak world oil market since theearly 1980s.   Saudi Arabia has a population of around 12 million, including anestimated 3 million expatriate workers.</TEXT></DOC>
