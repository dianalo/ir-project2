 But whatexactly is CASE?andP;  A flow-charting package that has been given a hefty dose ofgrowth hormones?andP;  That's not far off the mark; the key variable is the amountof hormones.andM;Vendors use &quot;CASE&quot; to describe everything from basic packages for drawingsimple data-flow diagrams to sophisticated software that often supportsdrawing complex, multi-level designs using a variety of syntaxes, buildingand maintaining data dictionaries and attribute files, entering descriptivetext and code segments, checking results for logical consistency, andgenerating design reports and sometimes even code.andP;  Such sophisticated CASEtools often support teams of developers either in a multiuser host or networkenvironment to allow individual development of parts of a design withsubsequent merging into the overall system.andM;Sage Software's vsDesigner Expert meets all these criteria except codegeneration.andP;  It's a complete CASE tool for people who develop and maintaincomplex software systems.andP;  It supports many popular charting syntaxes or letsyou build your own.andP;  It can generate more information about a design than youever wanted to know, and it runs on a variety of networks.andM;vsDesigner Expert includes three separate modules, each with separatemanuals.andP;  vsDEsigner, the core modules, is used to create and edit designs,verify their consistency, and manage design files.andP;  vs-Object Maker supportsediting existing design syntaxes and creating entirely new ones to fit theneeds of any software system or, if you're not into software, egg-processingplants.andP;  (Don't laugh: the example design furnished with vsDesigner Expert isan egg-processing plant, and a well-designed one at that.)andP;  vsReportersupports extracting information from the design, both interactively with asubset of IBM's Structured Query Language (SQL) and stand-alone QuickBASICprograms via a linkable function module.andM;The package's many features are impossible to cover in the limited space of areview.andP;  If you have questions about details, contact Sage Software.andM;I received the network version of vsDesigner Expert, which consists of 16360K floppy diskettes, and installed the package in its non-network configuration on a 25MHz, caching, 386 system running MS-DOS 3.3 withQuarterdeck's QEMM-386.andP;  According to Sage, the network version words withNovell, IBM Token Ring, PCnet, and most NETBIOS-compatible systems, althoughI did not have facilities to test network compatibility.andM;Installation is automated, with choices for drive and directory, mouse type,graphics adapter type, and syntaxes.andP;  Graphics adapter choices include CGA,EGA, VGA for PS/2, and Vega Video 7+.andP;  Although the menu implies thatvsDesigner doesn't support VGA on non-PS/2 machines, it does.andM;The only glitch in the installation occurred in the generated batch file thatinvokes vsReporter.andP;  I had to delete an undocumented command-line switch,which evidently told an undocumented executable file to use extended memory.andO;Although I'm still not sure exactly what I did, vsReporter worked properlyafter the deletion.andM;Unfortunately, none of the batch files are documented beyond theircommand-line invocation options, and all use various hard-wired switches.andO;This lack of documentation is especially interesting given that theaccompanying read me files for vsDesigner and vsReporter say (to paraphrase)that users with different hardware must make separate copies of the batchfiles and change them to match the hardware configurations.andP;  Obviously, acall to Sage Software may be necessary in such situations.andM;vsDesigner with example files uses about 1.5MB of disk space.andP;  AddingvsObject Maker and vsReporter ups the requirement to about 3.1MB.andP;  Installingthe package for network and non-network environments didn't change storagerequirements; the only apparent difference is a command-line switch in thevsDesigner batch file.andP;  However, I don't know if the non-network versionrequires less storage.andM;One warning: vsDesigner Expert is serious about having at least 512K RAMavailable and requires FILES=40, BUFFERS=32 in CONFIG.SYS to functionproperly.andP;  If you use device drivers and terminate-and-stay-resident programsthat eat DOS memory, you may need expanded memory and a memory managers toload the drivers and TSRs high for vsDesigner Expert to run.andM;vsDesigner is an extremely flexible tool for creating, editing, and checkingthe consistency of designs and managing design files.andP;  The basic componentsare a drawing screen and a hierarchy of menus that can be configured as Lotus1-2-3-style menus with brief help messages or pop-up menus without help.andP;  Thevisible screen is a high-resolution graphics window into a virtual screen of32K X 32K pixels that can be accessed by panning.andP;  Various zoom views displayall or parts of large drawings.andM;Although vsDesigner works without a mouse, I highly recommend using one.andP;  Youcan use the mouse to make menu selections; select designs for editing,archiving, and printing and create and edit designs.andP;  The keyboard isrequired to enter text such as labels, descriptions, and attributes, andaccess some services with function keys, such as file manipulation functions,default settings, and online help.andM;A design consists of nodes that contain objects with additional nodesattached to them.andP;  Available objects, such as processes, data stores, andconnectors, depend on the selected design syntax.andP;  Each node corresponds to alevel in the design hierarchy and a page of output.andP;  A node can contain up to2,000 objects, which should prove sufficient for most designs.andM;To build a design, first place the objects in the top-level node by selectingthem from a symbols menu.andP;  vsDesigner displays prompts with information onhow to place each object and center any required text such as object labels.andO;Then add detail by attaching additional nodes to the objects, amking surethat data flow into and out of child nodes corresponds to parent-object dataflow.andP;  Objects in child nodes can have children of their own as a design isdecomposed into more detail.andP;  A child node can effectively have severalparents, eliminating the need for duplicate subordinate branches in ahierarchy.andP;  If the design has a limit to the number of nodes, Sage Softwaredoesn't feel it's worthy of mention.andM;Navigation within a complex design is well implemented.andP;  To travel down thehierarchy, simply select Roam, hit F3, and then select Downtree.andP;  Objectswith child nodes are displayed with dotted outlines.andP;  Move the cursor to anobject and click twice with the mouse.andP;  vsDesigner displays the child node,again with dotted outlines for objects with children.andP;  To move back up,simply select Uptree.andM;Each node in a design is limited to a single syntax, but different nodes canuse different syntaxes up to a maximum of seven per design.andP;  vsDesigner comeswith a full complement of syntaxes including Yourdon data-flow,entity-relationship, state-diagram, and structure charts; Gane-Sarson;Ward-Mellor; Ward-Mellor 2167A; Booch; Warnier-Orr; a flow-chart syntax&quot;patterned after a standard promulgated by the International StandardsOrganization&quot; (I can't help but wonder which standard and why the syntaxdoesn't simply comply with it instead of being patterned after it); and asample entity-diagram syntax.andM;Unfortunately, if you're not familiar with these syntaxes, the manual is oflittle help.andP;  The syntax sections give the source of each syntax, a referencelist, brief explanations of applicable attributes, and a drawing of eachobject as it would be displayed by vsObject Maker, along with a one- ortwo-line description and a list of attributes.andP;  And you can't turn to theotherwise excellent, context-sensitive help facility: it doesn't includesyntax-specific information.andP;  vsDesigner would profit greatly from moredetailed syntax descriptions, including comparative strengths and weaknesses,tutorials, and example designs.andP;  Sage Software is aware of these deficienciesand plans to beef up the syntax documentation.andM;Objects in a design can include global and object attributes or both,depending on the object type.andP;  Global attributes usually belong in a datadictionary, and other attributes should be constant for multiple instances ofa specific object.andP;  All objects with the same label automatically have thesame global attributes.andP;  Global attribute files can be attached to multipledesigns to ensure that a team uses the same attributes for equivalent objectsin subdesigns that will later be merged.andM;Object attributes apply to individual objects.andP;  A connector's source anddestination are typical object attributes.andP;  A vsDesigner configuration optiondetermines whether the program automatically asks for attributes when youplace an object.andM;Four categories of text can be attached to nodes: text, notes, review, andcode.andP;  Each category can include up to 31K of ASCII text.andP;  Text is intendedfor detailed descriptions of nodes; notes is for private notes to thedeveloper; review is for comments from other design team members; and code isfor pseudocode or actual code.andP;  The labels are arbitrary, and you can enterany information in any category.andP;  However, the print menu supports printingtext by category so you could, for example, print all text and code but notprivate notes or review comments for a design report.andM;vsDesigner's text-entry feature is especially well implemented.andP;  The programdisplays a full-screen editor that emulates WordStar, Multimate, orWordPerfect--the choice is a configuration option.andP;  Obviously, the emulationisn't complete because a node typically doesn't need a book to describe it.andO;But the basic functions are the same, and the online help adjusts to theemulation.andP;  The text can include dot commands for setting margins, specifyingheaders and footers, and controlling page numbering.andM;As a design develops, you might have to deal with objects and all theirchildren.andP;  vsDesigner supports deleting an object and all its child nodes,merging a separate design as a subtree of nodes attached to an object,extracting an object and all child nodes as a separate design, and moving andcopying objects and their children within a design.andM;vsDesigner does an excellent job of printing designs and supportinginformation.andP;  The print menu supports draft and high-resolution quality andlandscape and portrait orientation.andP;  You can print all nodes in a design, aspecific subtree, or specific nodes along with any or all of the text andattributes associated with a node.andP;  The print menu also supports print filesthat contain user-specified information listing the nodes and text to printfor a design.andP;  This is handy if you need to routinely produce hard copy as adesign develops.andM;Printer output can be directed to a file that can later be copied to thetarget printer--a handy feature for electronic transfer of design output.andO;The only obvious omission is the ability to print graphics to a file in aformat such as the Hewlett-Packard graphics language or encapsulatedPostScript that is compatible with desktop publishing packages.andP;  This abilitywould be handy for including designs in formal reports.andM;Verifying design consistency is a key feature of any CASE tool, andvsDesigner supports it in two ways.andP;  A configuration option turns onautomatic connection-making and enables consistency-checking as you build adesign.andP;  Anytime you add a connection or child node, the programautomatically checks the addition.andM;Stand-alone utilities are included for detailed consistency-checking ofdesigns using the Yourdon, Gane-Sarson, and Ward-Mellor syntaxes.andP;  Theseutilities validate connectors, ensure that parent and child nodes areconsistent for input and output data flow, find terminal objects (thosewithout children) with improper input or output, check for nodes that shouldbe further decomposed, and list all locations where objects with the samelabels are used.andM;vsObject Maker is a key tool for anyone who needs to expand on the providedsyntaxes.andP;  The tool can be used to edit syntaxes or build new ones.andP;  SageSoftware used vsObject Maker to create the syntaxes that come with vsDesignerExpert.andM;Like vsDesigner, vsObject Maker supports Lotus 1-2-3-style or pop-up menus.andO;Although a mouse isn't required, I recommend using one.andM;The basic components include a file-management facility for selecting,archiving, and restoring syntaxes; an edit menu that displays the objects ina syntax for editing, copying, or deletion; an editing screen for creatingand editing objects; text-entry screens for defining attribute information;and a syntax compiler for compiling syntaxes into a form usable byvsDesigner.andP;  The package is intuitive and easy to use with excellent,context-sensitive help.andM;Creating a new syntax requires several steps.andP;  First, fill out a brief formthat includes the syntax name, number, author, revision number, and comment.andO;vsObject Maker then displays a blank edit menu with a grid of 20 empty boxesthat can display objects with a menu, which includes entries for editing,creating, deleting, copying, and setting attributes for the objects.andO;Eventually, these boxes will fill with objects in the order of their creationto be selected for subsequent editing.andP;  The edit screen scrolls toaccommodate syntaxes with more than 20 objects.andM;The first step in creating an object is to select Create from the edit menufollowed by the object type.andP;  vsObject Maker supports four types of objects.andO;Terminals include objects such as processes, data stores, and externalentities.andP;  Connectors express data flow between terminals.andP;  End pointsterminate connectors.andP;  Modifiers are objects that can be placed close toterminals to add to their meaning but not joined with connectors.andM;After you select an object type, vsObject Maker displays the drawing screen,which consists of four parts.andP;  The top of the screen shows various objectinformation, such as help prompts associated with the object.andP;  The leftportion is the drawing area for creating and editing objects.andP;  The rightportion shows the object's actual size as it will appear in flow charts.andP;  Adrawing menu stretches across the bottom.andM;To continue creating the object, first set the grid size for the drawingscreen.andP;  This restricts cursor movement to a fixed grid and helps makeobjects symmetrical.andP;  Unfortunately, vsObject Maker doesn't display the gridpoints, which would help when drawing symmetrical objects.andP;  Next, select thearc angle to restrict the number of degrees by which an arc can beincremented.andP;  For example, selecting 45 restricts arcs to 45, 90, 135, and soon through 360 degrees.andM;Now select Addpieces to start drawing the object.andP;  A terminal object canconsist of lines; polylines; round-cornered, square-cornered, and invisibleboxes; text; and arcs.andP;  Most of these pieces are self-explanatory.andP;  Polylinesare simply continuous lines that can be used to draw arrow heads, forexample, with a single line instead of three lines.andP;  Invisible boxes are foruser text such as process names.andP;  With the proper object flags set, aninvisible box expands with the amount of text entered, automatically sizingthe object accordingly.andP;  Arcs can be used to draw arcs, ellipses, andcircles.andP;  As you draw the object, the right side of the screen automaticallychanges to reflect the object's actual size.andM;You can also select various styles for object pieces.andP;  These include variousdashed lines, outline colors, and fill colors.andP;  The only problem Iencountered was when filling an object that contained text.andP;  Some colorsobscure the text; others don't.andP;  The manual is of little help--it just tellsyou to experiment.andM;After the object is complete, you have to enter information and set severalflags.andP;  The textual information includes the object name, Lotus 1-2-3-stylehelp message that will be displayed by the vsDesigner symbols menu, and helpprompts that vsDesigner displays while you are placing the object in adesign.andP;  A typical text form for a data connector based on an arc might looklike Listing 1.andM;The vsDesigner symbols menu would include DataFlow with Add data flowconnector to design below it.andP;  When you place the object in a design,vsDesigner displays each prompt as the left mouse button is clicked to placethe object or cancels the entry of the object if the right mouse button isclicked.andM;You must now set several flags to give vsDesigner information on how theobject should be drawn and used in a design.andP;  For example, one set of flagsdetermines the source of associated text for the object (user, name, fixedstring, or ID number) and how the text is positioned relative to the object.andO;Another set of flags determines whether the object is of fixed size or issizable, and, if sizable, whether it can be expanded vertically,horizontally, or both, and if its aspect ratio should be maintained.andP;  Otherflags determine whether an object can have child nodes, inter-objectconnections, no connections, or is a data dictionary object, whichautomatically can have child nodes.andM;You can describe both global and object attributes via an attribute form.andP;  Itincludes entries for the attribute name, type (character, two- or four-byteinteger), and whether the attribute should be used as an index field in thedesign database.andP;  For connectors, you must also indicate which terminalobjects may be legally connected.andM;While all this may seem pretty involved, vsObject Maker's excellent designmakes creating objects much simpler than it sounds.andP;  The only problem I hadwas a corrupted syntax.andP;  This was made evident by a cryptic Get first symerror 2 displayed by the edit screen (with no explanation in the manual) andan empty object-selection grid.andP;  Pressing Escape and trying to create anobject resulted in aborting to DOS.andP;  Because I had already archived thecorrupted syntax files, the syntax was lost.andP;  Therefore, always keep at leastone extra generation of backup archives for syntaxes.andP;  Sage Software had noexplanation to offer except a possible I/O or hard disk error, which soundsto me like a more sophisticated way of saying, &quot;Gee, we don't know.&quot;andM;vsReporter extracts information from a design.andP;  The first step in usingvsReporter is building a design glossary, which the program doesautomatically.andP;  The contents of the glossary can be retrieved as a series oftables.andM;vsReporter consists of two basic components: an interactive program for adhoc queries and a Microsoft QuickBASIC interface.andP;  Both use Novell's Btrieveand Xtrieve database management tools to support a subset of SQL forretrieving information.andP;  The interactive program is a complete, menu-drivenprogram for entering queries and displaying, printing, or saving results in afile.andP;  The Microsoft QuickBASIC interface is an object module for creatingstandalone programs to retrieve information.andP;  These programs are invoked viaa batch file that loads the appropriate Novell executable files.andM;The supported subset of SQL includes the select, update, insert, and deletestatements.andP;  update, insert, and delete are used to modify attributes.andO;select generates reports and supports a full complement of clauses andfeatures including from, where, group by, having, order by, logicaloperators, and computed fields.andP;  select statements can be grouped intoall-or-none transactions.andM;Statements are entered using vsReporter's word-processing screen, which isequivalent to vsDesigner's text-entry screen.andP;  The word-processing screenalso displays results.andP;  A typical query for the example egg-processing plantmight look like Listing 2.andM;If this looks somewhat arcane, it is.andP;  The query arguments are elements inthe design glossary.andP;  An explanation is beyond the scope of this review, butthe manual provides explanations and examples.andP;  vsReporter also includesseveral SQL query files that contain working examples of complex queries withbrief explanatory comments.andP;  As this implies, complex queries can be storedin files for later reuse and editing.andP;  Reports can also be saved.andM;The BASIC interface includes six functions that can be used to createstand-alone programs for performing more detailed analyses.andP;  These functionsbasically log in and out of designs, compile and execute SQL statements, andretrieve results.andM;vsReporter includes several sample programs that are clearly written andcommented.andP;  They all compiled with no errors using QuickBASIC v 4.5 and ranwithout a glitch.andP;  A BASIC program can't be executed from within theQuickBASIC environment because of the needed Btrieve/Xtrieve executables.andM;Surprisingly, vsReporter doesn't support a mouse, even though it uses Lotus1-2-3-style menus similar to those of vsDesigner and vsObject Maker.andP;  And youcan't configure the program for pop-up menus.andP;  Evidently, Sage Softwaresimply hasn't gotten around to adding these features.andM;vsReporter is an excellent facility for examining designs.andP;  It's easy to use(after you master the glossary items used in queries) and it generates clearreports.andM;With the exceptions noted about the documentation of batch files, syntaxes,and error messages, the manuals for vsDesigner Expert are complete and wellwritten.andP;  Each manual includes a fairly extensive tutorial that's a godsendfor getting up to speed with the software.andP;  The manuals also include commandreference sections with complete menu diagrams and clear explanations of eachmenu choice with examples.andP;  Other topics include installation requirements,operation in network environments, design rule checking, and error messages.andM;All the information you'll need is in the documentation, but don't expect themanuals to teach you how to use a syntax.andP;  For that, you'll need to buyadditional references.andM;If your organization needs additional training, Sage Software offers coursesfor each module in vsDesigner Expert.andP;  The complete course for all threemodules lasts five days.andM;Sage Software's technical support is excellent.andP;  The company has regular andtoll-free telephone numbers and a fax number.andP;  Several calls to the toll-freenumber resulted in no busy signals.andP;  This is a welcome change from sometechnical support departments.andP;  Standard support hours are from 8:30 a.m.andP;  to8:00 p.m.andP;  EST.andP;  If a true emergency occurs (such as a reviewer with aquestion on the night of a deadline), after-hours emergency help isavailable.andP;  After making such an emergency call, I got a call back from atechnical support person who was at home, which I find astounding.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
