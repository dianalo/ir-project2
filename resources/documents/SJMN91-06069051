More than 500,000 soldiers are still in defensive positions inthe gulf, with many stationed in potentially dangerous desert outposts andfoxholes.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Front  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  ANXIETY, ANGER GRIP FAMILIES OF TROOPS LEFTBEHIND  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  WAR IN THE GULFSee also related stories on pages 1A, 13A and 18A of this section.  </MEMO><TEXT>     Worried there still could be fighting, the families here cannot rest untilthey hear that voice on the phone saying, &quot;Mom, I'm safe. I'm coming home.&quot;;   &quot;We spend millions on bombs, can't we spend a little money on telephones?&quot;asked Caroline Brown of Fremont, who was desperately trying to find outwhether her son, Robert Sotello, was returning to a Georgia base thisweekend.;    &quot;This is bad public relations for the military,&quot; said Brown, whoby late Friday was unsuccessful in finding out anything about her son.;   Added Darleen Garman, mother of San Jose Army Pvt. Ricky Webb: &quot;It's great tosee troops coming home, but what about the ones still over there? How do Iknow if my son is OK?&quot;;    Timetables for the return home of all troops areuncertain, and many soldiers are still hundreds of miles from militarytelephone banks in Saudi Arabia, military spokesmen said. Because oflogistical problems, it is not likely many Americans will hear from most ofthe soldiers soon, spokesmen say.;    &quot;This is not a laid-back situationhere,&quot; said Maj. Thomas Nickerson, a spokesman for the U.S. Military Commandin Saudi Arabia. &quot;There has not been a final cease-fire. We are still inbattle-ready situations where anything can happen.&quot;;    That is not acomforting thought for relatives of gulf soldiers.;    Garman last received atelephone call from her son more than a month ago. On Friday afternoon, shereceived a letter Webb wrote during the ground war. Although the fightingstopped more than a week ago, Garman has received no recent word about herson's duties.;    &quot;I don't know if my son is coming home,&quot; she said, fightingback tears. &quot;I don't know if he is ill, or shot in the leg, or what. . . .It's just unfair to have to go on like this.&quot;;    Volunteers at OperationYellow Ribbon, the family support group based in South San Francisco, sayroughly half of the several thousand members in their 27 chapters nationwidehave had no recent contact with military relatives in the gulf.;    Familiescalling the Pentagon are told only that their loved ones are safe if theirnames do not appear on a casualty list.;    &quot;That's all we know: that they aresafe,&quot; said Molly Webb of San Jose, a Yellow Ribbon volunteer who has notheard from her son, Thomas Alcorn, since January. &quot;We're not even told wherethey are or what they are doing.&quot;;    Gaye Jacobson, Yellow Ribbon founder,heard from her son, Derek, on Sunday after he waited on line at 4 a.m. SaudiArabia time to use the telephones.;    &quot;It's absolute madness there,&quot; Jacobsonsaid. &quot;My son said people can wait for hours in long lines to use thetelephones. I bet a lot of them gave up because the lines are so long.&quot;;   Jacobson advises relatives not to lose their cool. &quot;It's the not knowing thatis driving people crazy,&quot; she said.;    In a telephone call to the Pentagon,Garman found out this week that her son's company was still deployed in theIraqi desert in &quot;defense positions.&quot; An Army major spent nearly half an hourtrying to comfort Garman, she said. But she felt little relief.;    As she hasdone throughout the war, Garman goes to church every morning. She still wearsred, white and blue outfits and flag earrings.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  E.A.
