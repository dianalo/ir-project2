Another group of about 120 is expected to return home withindays, and 850 others are awaiting repatriation on later flights,according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.   A chartered Boeing 737 carried 52 men, 47 women, 12 boys and 11girls to Hanoi, bringing the number of Vietnamese repatriated underthe U.N.-sponsored program to 385 in four flights since March.   Waving their red boarding passes and shaking hands with refugeerelief officials, the Vietnamese boarded the plane carrying plasticshopping bags filled with personal possessions. Some parentscarried toddlers while other Vietnamese carried huge ``boom box''cassette players.   ``We believe that voluntary repatriation works,'' said AnneShepherd, deputy chief of the U.N. refugee office in Hong Kong.``The number of people applying has increased substantially.''   She said that since the voluntary repatriation program startedin mid-1988, the number of Vietnamese applying to go home hasincreased from about 30 a month to about 65 each week.   But the number of Vietnamese volunteering to go home representsonly a fraction of the nearly 44,000 boat people in the colony whohave not been granted refugee status, and the Hong Kong governmentsays other measures are needed.   Hong Kong officials maintain that boat people who are deniedrefugee status must be repatriated against their will if necessary,but Hanoi has yet to accept such a program.   Washington also has expressed opposition to forciblerepatriation.   The returning boat people are taken to their hometowns andmonitored by the U.N. refugee organization. ``So far, we have hadno indication of any problems'' for the returning Vietnamese, Ms.Shepherd said on the tarmac of Hong Kong international airport.   Boat people returning to their impoverished Communist homelandreceive $50 for adults and $25 for children by the U.N.organization.   The Hong Kong government earlier accepted all Vietnamese boatpeople as refugees entitled to resettlement. But under a toughpolicy adopted in June 1988 to stem the rising tide ofasylum-seekers, the government ruled out resettlement for newarrivals unless they could prove they were fleeing politicalpersecution.   The vast majority of the more than 44,000 boat people to arriveunder the new policy will fail to receive refugee status.   Nearly 12,700 Vietnamese still in Hong Kong camps arrived beforeJune 1988 and are eligible for resettlement.</TEXT></DOC>
