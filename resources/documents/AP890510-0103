The Ministry of Supervision said today it will allow more opennews reporting of corruption cases, a move ``prompted by the recentdemands of Beijing University students to crack down oncorruption.''   Today's protest by more than 5,000 students came a day aftergovernment officials received a petition signed by more than 1,000Chinese journalists seeking press freedom.   Thousands of students in the northern city of Taiyuan also tookto the streets today in what the official Xinhua News agencydescribed as ``massive demonstrations.''   Xinhua said the students held sit-ins in front of a hotel andthe headquarters of the Shanxi provincial government, demandingdialogue with the governor. The two-sentence report gave no otherdetails.   It was the first protest reported in Taiyuan, 260 milessouthwest of Beijing, since students in the capital begandemonstrating in mid-April.   The Beijing demonstration was largely to support thejournalists' petition.   ``We're riding bicycles today because we're too tired to walk,''said a history student who attended four recent marches along the10-mile route from the nation's top schools to Tiananmen Squaredowntown.   ``The road to democracy is very long,'' said a Tibetan studentfrom the Nationalities Institute. ``We are riding on bicycles toget there faster.''   About 1,000 protesters pedaled out of Beijing University, thecountry's most prestigious, and were joined by students from aboutsix other schools.   Protesters filled all six lanes of the street in front of theirfirst stop, China Central Television headquarters, and shoutedslogans critical of the government-controlled media.   ``The People's Daily cheats the people!'' they chanted,referring to the ruling Communist Party's official newspaper. ``Thepress must speak the truth!'' they yelled.   Many cyclists wore green, yellow and red headbands that read,``Democracy, Freedom and Beijing University.''   As the colorful procession passed major intersections lined withworkers, several students would raise both hands to flash the ``V''for victory sign.   Police, who in previous demonstrations tried to blockprotesters, helped clear the way for the bicyclists as trafficbacked up for several miles. Some students distributed leaflets onbuses that urged, ``Liberate the press.''   After the rally outside the TV headquarters, the protestersmoved to the main office of state-run Xinhua News Agency and laterto police headquarters, where they chanted: ``Thank you police, forworking for the people.''   On its way to the People's Daily, the party mouthpiece, theprocession's loose organization gave way to some disorder when itran into rush-hour traffic.   At the People's Daily, several thousand people gathered outsideand cheered as the students inched by. A group of about 50 writersand poets also joined the protest march. By evening, the studentswere on their way home.   Cyclists carried a statement protesting ``government delaystoward the students request for a dialogue'' and demanding ``thatas soon as possible the government hold a true, open dialogue thatwill resolve problems of concern to the broad masses of people.''   The government has refused to meet with independent studentgroups established over the past month.   At the front of the leisurely paced procession were studentstraveling by three-wheel pedicart who held high a banner that said,``The press must speak the truth.''   A free press is a major demand of university students who sincemid-April have staged the largest demonstrations in CommunistChina's 40-year history. ``Early this week we were tired, but nowwe are ready to fight again,'' said one history student fromBeijing University, a campus of more than 10,000.   The last mass march was Thursday, when tens of thousands ofpeople poured into Tiananmen Square _ the country's symbolic seatof power _ to celebrate the 70th anniversary of China's firststudent movement.   The bicycle procession was organized by Beijing University,where sentiment to maintain the pro-democracy movement is strongest.   When other schools decided to end a two-week class boycott overthe weekend, Beijing University students immediately voted tocontinue the strike to apply pressure on the government to respondto their demands.</TEXT></DOC>
