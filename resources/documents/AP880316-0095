On March 2, a ``message of peace'' created by the publisher of aCanadian computer magazine appeared on as many as 350,000 Macintoshcomputer screens in North America and Europe, apparently spreadlike an epidemic through the network of electronic bulletin boards'free or low-cost software.   The message became the first known contamination of anoff-the-shelf program when it cropped up in FreeHand, Aldus Corp.'slatest software, forcing the company to recall or rework about5,000 copies of the program.   It ``was a very benign incident,'' but Aldus officials ``aretalking with our attorneys to understand what our legal rights arein this instance,'' said Laury Bryant, a spokeswoman for theSeattle-based software company.   Viruses are small, secret programs created by programmers asjokes or acts of vandalism, then secretly inserted into otherprograms. Viruses can spread from computer to computer by operatorssharing ``contaminated'' software.   At their most benign, viruses will cause only a message to popup on a computer screen, as apparently happened here. At theirworst, as ``tapeworms'' or ``logic bombs,'' they can destroyinformation stored in computer memories.   Richard Brandow of the Montreal-based computer magazine MacMagtold The Associated Press in a telephone interview Tuesday that hewrote the virus, but intended only to show the dangers of softwarepiracy, or unauthorized copying.   The full message, said Brandow, read: ``Richard Brandow, thepublisher of MacMag, and its entire staff would like to take thisopportunity to convey their universal message of peace to allMacintosh users around the world.'' Beneath that was a graphic ofthe globe.   Ms. Bryant said fewer than 5,000 copies of FreeHand werecontaminated by a an infected disk that was copied for three daysby a disk duplicating machine, and only half the infected diskswere distributed to retailers.   Until now, personal computer viruses were thought to reside onlyin noncommercial ``freeware'' or ``shareware'' legally distributedon computerized bulletin boards or on software disks shared bycomputer users.   Experts had thought viruses could be avoided if users didn'tfreely distribute software, but only used off-the-shelf programs.   The incident rocked the computer industry because the nation'sthree largest software companies _ Microsoft Corp., Ashton-Tate,and Lotus Development Corp. _ are clients of MacroMind Inc. ofChicago, the company that inadvertently gave the virus to Aldus.   Ashton-Tate declined comment, but officials at Microsoft, Appleand Lotus said none of their software was infected.   MacroMind President Marc Canter said in a telephone interviewTuesday that to the best of his knowledge, none of his othercustomers received the virus and that the program has erased itself.   Ms. Bryant and Brandow said the virus died out after March 2,the anniversary of the introduction of Apple's Macintosh SE andMacintosh II models.   Canter said the peace message apparently was in software heobtained from Brandow during a visit to Montreal. The packetincluded a game program called Mr. Potato Head, a computerizedversion of the popular toy.   Unaware of the ``infection,'' Canter ran the game program onceand then used the same computer to work on a disk to teachMacintosh users how to use FreeHand.   That original disk became infected, and then contaminated otherFreeHand teaching disks when it was copied by Aldus, he said.   Canter, upset with Brandow, also said he was considering legalaction. Brandow said he met Canter, but denied giving him thesoftware.   Brandow said the idea for the message program was written andtested for a year, then left for two days in December on aMacintosh at MacMag's offices, a frequent gathering place forMacintosh devotees.   The publisher said he expected pirated programs from the machinewould spread the peace message in the Montreal area and a few otherareas of Canada and the United States.   Instead, he said, he was shocked to find that, by his estimate,350,000 people in North America and Europe had the message pop upon their Macintoshes on March 2.</TEXT></DOC>
