Section 8 of the Act requiredthe development of a Comprehensive Management Plan (Plan) within 5 yearsof the enactment of the law, and section 10 directed the Secretary of Agricultureto promulgate rules as he deemed necessary to accomplish the purposes ofthe Act. The Forest Service interpreted the language of section 10 of theAct as granting rulemaking discretion to the Secretary, rather than compellingthe Secretary to promulgate rules, and believed that the management directionto be developed through the Plan and already established in existing regulationswould be adequate to manage the Recreation Area. In accordance with section8, the Forest Service developed, with full public involvement, a ComprehensiveManagement Plan for the Hells Canyon National Recreation Area. The Planrelied on existing regulations governing National Forest management inchapter II of title 36 of the Code of Federal Regulations to meet managementobjectives and standards for the Recreation Area. For example, managementdirection for wilderness in the Plan is based on the rules at 36 CFR parts219 and 293 as well as the Wilderness provisions of the Act establishingthe Recreation Area.Recently, the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, in <T3>Oregon Natural Resources Council </T3>v. <T3>Lyng, </T3>D.C. No. CV-88-680-PA, ruled that the Secretary must promulgaterules as specified in section 10 of the Act to address standards and guidelinesfor the protection and preservation of the historic, archeological, andpaleontological resources, use and management of roads and trails, useand number of rivercraft, timber management, mining, range management,wildlife and fisheries, and other resources. In response, the Departmentis promulgating this interim rule. Because regulations are in place thatadequately guide management of most of the resources of the RecreationArea, this rule does not repeat those rules but rather makes clear thatthese other rules apply to the Recreation Area. This approach is fullyconsistent with the Circuit Court's finding that section 10 ``compels theSecretary to promulgate nonduplicative regulations'' (Op., p. 20).Section-by-Section AnalysisThe interim rule establishes a new subpart F of part 292, Hells CanyonNational Recreation Area in title 36 of the Code of Federal Regulations.Section 292.40 establishes that the purpose of the rules is to govern themanagement of Federally-owned lands within the Recreation Area. It shouldbe noted that the agency is developing and will propose at a later timeseparate rules governing private land uses within the Recreation Area asrequired by section 10 of the Act. In accordance with section 7 of theAct this section of the rules provides that the area will be managed inaccordance with the rules of the subpart as well as other rules of title36, chapter II, of the Code of Federal Regulations. This section liststhe major existing rules that apply to Hells Canyon National RecreationArea management but makes clear that in event of any inconsistency betweenthese rules and other existing rules, the rules of subpart F have precedence.Section 292.41 sets forth definitions of terms used in this rule. The definitionsof various silvicultural terms used in the rule are those found in ForestService Manual section 2470.5, Amendment 148, 10/88, and ``Terminologyof Forest Science Technology Practices and Products'' published by theSociety of American Foresters (1971) which is the recognized basis forsilvicultural terminology and definitions.Section 292.42 provides direction for developing a Comprehensive ManagementPlan for the Recreation Area as required by section 8 of the Act. Becausethe Recreation Area is comprised of lands from 3 National Forests locatedin the States of Idaho and Oregon, it is necessary to assign administrativeresponsibility for preparing the plan. Thus, paragraph (1) of andSection;292.42 assigns the planning responsibility to the Forest Supervisor ofthe Wallowa-Whitman National Forest, in which the largest percentage ofthe Recreation Area is located. Paragraph (b) sets forth the management objectives that the ComprehensiveManagement Plan must address. These objectives are a restatement of thoseset forth in section 7 of the Act itself, which have proven to be sufficientlycomprehensive to guide the resource management planning for the RecreationArea. Therefore, there is no need to expand these objectives further inthe rule. Paragraph (c) of this section requires that the Plan establish the array,manner, and levels of resource use and enhancement and set forth the broadmanagement direction for the area. It is not feasible or practical to establishthe intensity, mix, and methods of resource use in regulation. These decisionsmust be based on site-specific data and consideration of various alternativesformulated in response to that data, as well as public review and involvement.Paragraph (c) also makes clear that management direction and practicesidentified in the Plan must be consistent with standards set forth in andSection;292.43 of the rule. Because the Agency originally concluded that additional rules were notneeded to govern the Hells Canyon National Recreation Area, the Agencyproceeded to develop a Comprehensive Management Plan, which was adoptedApril 30, 1982. To avoid any question as to the status of that plan inlight of the Ninth Circuit Court's Ruling, paragraph (d) asserts and directsthat the Plan as adopted shall continue to guide the management of thearea. This paragraph also brings the adopted plan into uniformity withother Agency-wide planning by directing that the Plan be incorporated aspart of the Wallowa-Whitman National Forest Management Plan and that futurerevisions or amendments to the Hells Canyon Plan shall be made in accordancewith the rules governing forest planning at 36 CFR part 219. This assurespublic involvement in any future revisions or amendments and assures thepublic that the Agency established land and resource management planningprocess will apply to such revisions. The Act itself did not address theneed for and manner of revisions of the Comprehensive Management Plan;therefore, the provisions of the National Forest Management Act and implementingregulations at 36 CFR part 219 apply. Section 292.43 establishes management standards for Federal land in theRecreation Area Comprehensive Management Plan. Consistent with the directiongoverning the plan in andSection; 292.42, the rules of this section do notestablish levels, intensities, types, and mixes of resource uses. Ratherthis section establishes baseline standards and guidelines for resourcemanagement within the Recreation Area which the plan must embrace. Theseguidelines are consistent with the broad management objectives containedin the Comprehensive Management Plan, which were adopted following fullpublic involvement and comment and have proven to be adequate guidancefor devising more specific direction for managing the area and for implementingspecific project plans within the area. (a) <T3>Cultural Resources. </T3>The Recreation Area contains a virtual storehouseof historic and prehistoric evidence of human occupation. Existing regulationsat 36 CFR parts 36, 62, 63, 65, 68, 78, 296, and 800 are adequate to ensurefull protection and preservation of historic, archeological, and paleontologicalresources within the Recreation Area. The interim rule does not replicatethe requirements of these existing regulations but directs that the culturalresources of the Recreation Area be protected and preserved through inventoryingcultural resources, recommending areas for listing on the National Registerof Historic Places, monitoring and protecting known cultural resourcesfrom vandalism, conducting research of the cultural resources, and stabilizing,maintaining, and/or improving important historic sites. (b) <T3>Roads and Trails. </T3>Section 10 of the Act requires that the rulesinclude provisions for ``control of the use of motorized and mechanicalequipment for transportation over, or alteration of, the surface of anyFederal Land within the Recreation Area''. Existing regulations at 36 CFRparts 212_Forest Development Roads and Trails; 262_Prohibitions; and 295_Useof Motor Vehicles Off Forest Development Roads are adequate for establishingcontrol of motorized and mechanical equipment. Moreover, transportationneeds and uses within the Recreation Area must be identified and consideredin the context of the overall management objectives for the Area as partof the comprehensive management planning. Accordingly, the interim ruledoes not specify the controls on use and type of vehicles but rather directsthat the Recreation Area Ranger shall establish such controls as are necessaryto meet the requirements of the Act, these regulations, and the managementobjectives of the Comprehensive Management Plan. In addition, consistentwith the purposes for which the Recreation Area was established, paragraph(b) of this section gives emphasis to providing the public adequate andsafe access to recreational and other sites. Finally, this section directsthat alternative transportation routes may be developed to meet resourcemanagement objectives identified in the Comprehensive Management Plan.(c) <T3>Use and Number of Rivercraft. </T3>Paragraph (c) directs that the use,type, and number of rivercraft shall be consistent with the purposes forwhich the area was established and shall be regulated through the managementdirection in the Plan and applicable rules of chapter II of title 36 ofthe Code of Federal Regulations. The interim rule specifically requiresthat the Plan address seasons of use and opportunities for outfitters andguide services. (d) <T3>Timber Management. </T3>Section 7 of the Act directs the Secretaryto manage the Recreation Area for public outdoor recreation in accordancewith laws, rules, and regulations applicable to the National Forests andin a manner compatible with, among other objectives, management, utilization,and disposal of natural resources including ``timber harvesting by selectivecutting.'' Section 10 of the Act, as interpreted by the Ninth Circuit Court,directs the Secretary to include in the rules governing the area ``standardsfor such management, utilization and disposal of natural resources, including,but not limited to, timber harvesting by selective cutting * * *'' Accordingly, paragraph (d) of andSection; 292.43 of the interim rule setsforth two major guidelines for managing the timber resources of the RecreationArea; namely, that timber be managed_(1) To perpetuate healthy stands of diverse tree species, size, and ageclasses, and (2) To emphasize stand condition, scenery, wildlife habitat, and recreationneeds over optimum wood fiber production. The rule further provides that timber harvesting shall be by selectioncutting methods and generally limits permitted silvicultural treatmentto individual tree selection, group selection, sanitation, salvage, andintermediate cuts. It should be noted that the language of section 10 of the Act refers totimber harvesting by ``selective cutting.'' As defined by the Society ofAmerican Foresters, ``selective cutting'' is a type of exploitation cuttingthat removes only the largest and most valuable species from a stand. Thispractice, known as high grading, is inconsistent with the legislative historyof the Act which clearly shows that Congress intended that timber be harvestedselectively and not in an exploitive manner. Thus, the interim rule adoptsthe term ``selection cutting'' which is an uneven-aged cutting method whichcan involve cutting of individual trees and/or as small groups of trees.It is also evident from the legislative history of the Act that Congressintended broader discretion for salvaging timber in unusual situationsthan the term ``selection cutting'' would ordinarily permit. The reportof the Senate Energy Committee states: ``. . . Where unusual situationsexist, for example, in cases of fire, insect, disease, or wind-damagedtimber, clearcutting is permitted to be practiced where its use would mitigatethe situation. This is intended to be the exception rather than the rule''.(S. Rept. No. 94-153, 94th Cong., 1st Sess., P. 5.). Accordingly, the interimrule adopts the language from Senate Report to permit clearcutting wherethis practice is determined to be the best timber harvest practice to mitigateresource deterioration or the spread of forest pests to adjacent standsof timber. (e) <T3>Mining. </T3>The Act recognizes the exercise of valid existing miningrights within the Recreation Area and requires that the rules address mining.Because the Act withdrew the Recreation Area from further entry under theMining Laws, paragraph (e) prohibits the Area Ranger from approving anyapplication for location, entry, or patent of minerals under the U.S. Mininglaws. The interim rule incorporates the provision of the Act that allows theexercise of valid mining rights existing on the date of enactment and givesnotice that such activity is subject to the Secretary's mining regulationsat 36 CFR part 228. In exercising its authority to manage surface disturbingactivities, the Forest Service will regulate mining activities to assurethey are conducted in a manner consistent with the Act and so as not topreclude meeting the management objectives and direction of the rules orthe Comprehensive Management Plan. Consistent with Agency policy (ForestService Manual Title 2800), the Area Ranger will work cooperatively withmining operators to try to identify methods of operation that are compatiblewith the area's management. (f) <T3>Range Management. </T3>Ranching and livestock grazing are traditionaluses within the Recreation Area. The Act recognizes these uses and providesfor grazing under existing regulations at 36 CFR, 219.20 and part 222 tothe extent compatible with the administrative provisions of section 7 ofthe Act. (g) <T3>Wildlife and Fisheries. </T3>Hells Canyon National Recreation Areacontains important resident and anadromous fisheries and provides habitatfor a variety of wildlife. Section 7 of the Act directs the Secretary toadminister the Area to provide for protection and maintenance of fish andwildlife habitat and section 12 recognizes hunting and fishing pursuantto Federal and State laws as a recognized use. Accordingly, paragraph (g)(1)establishes broad management standards to emphasize diversity of wildlifehabitat for game and nongame species, to enhance opportunities for survivaland increase of threatened and endangered species, and to provide publicenjoyment of the protection of wildlife. In addition, section 12 of the Act provides discretion for the Secretaryto designate zones where, and establish periods when, no hunting or fishingshall be permitted for reasons of public safety, administration or publicuse and enjoyment. Paragraph (g)(2) of this section of the interim ruleauthorizes the Forest Supervisor to designate zones and periods when huntingand fishing shall not be permitted. (h) <T3>Other Resources. </T3>There are many other forest resources and valuesthat must be addressed in managing the Recreation Area. The Act does notrequire that rules address these other resources and existing law, regulations,and policy are adequate to guide their management. Accordingly, this paragraphof this interim rule merely recognizes the need to address additional resourcevalues and uses through the Comprehensive Management Plan. Need for Interim Rule The Secretary of Agriculture is promulgating this interim rule based ona finding resulting from a legal action filed against the Secretary fora salvage timber sale. This timber sale, Duck Creek, was to salvage deadand dying timber from a spruce bark beetle infestation. The Forest Supervisormade a finding of No Significant Impact and issued a Decision Notice toadvertise and award the timber sale. After unsuccessfully pursuing administrativeappeals to stop the sale, the appellants filed suit in the U.S. DistrictCourt for the District of Oregon, <T3>Oregon Natural Resources Council </T3>v. <T3>Lyng, </T3>alleging that the Forest Service had violated the NationalEnvironmental Policy Act (NEPA), and the Clean Water Act, and that theSecretary had violated the Hells Canyon National Recreation Area Act byfailing to promulgate rules as required by section 10 of the Act. Followinga trial on the merits held July 7, 1988, the District Court found for theForest Service by finding the proposed sale was in accordance with applicablelaw. On appeal by the plaintiffs, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, affirmedthe District Court's finding with regard to the National EnvironmentalProtection and Clean Water Acts. However, the Court ruled that the Secretarydid not have the discretion not to promulgate rules under section 10 ofthe Act, and that the language of the Act compelled the Secretary to promulgaterules to govern both the Federal lands and private lands use of the RecreationArea. As a result of the Court's ruling, regulations issued under section 10of the Act are necessary to permit ongoing activities, particularly timbersales, to continue without disruption. Salvage timber sales are particularlyaffected due to rapid deterioration of timber damaged by fire and insects.Approximately 34 million board feet of timber is awaiting immediate harvest.This timber was prepared for sale due to fire and insect damage and, ifnot marketed within the next few weeks, will lose considerable value ordeteriorate to the extent that it is not salvageable. Accordingly, thereis an urgent need to promulgate these rules as an interim rule. The timerequired to publish a proposed rule for public comment prior to adoptionof a final rule would create a managerial hiatus and could lead to furtherlegal challenge and uncertainty over the sales, resulting in serious disruptionof the ongoing management activities. Therefore, there is good cause forpublishing these rules as interim rules without opportunity for publiccomment. However, public comment is invited on the interim rule and willbe considered in adoption of the final rule. Environmental Impact This interim rule is promulgated in accordance with section 10 of the HellsCanyon National Recreation Area Act, (16 U.S.C. 460gg). The potential environmentalimpact of management direction (and of six alternative management plans)for the area were analyzed and disclosed in the environmental impact statementfor the Comprehensive Management Plan that was transmitted to the EnvironmentalProtection Agency on May 28, 1981. A review of this rule indicates no potentialfor significant effect on the quality of the human environment other thanthat previously disclosed in the environmental impact statement. The environmentalconsequences of any future projects will be subject to Forest Service NationalEnvironmental Policy Act procedures. Therefore, no additional environmentaldocumentation is deemed needed on this rule.Regulatory ImpactThis interim rule has been reviewed under Department of Agriculture proceduresimplementing Executive Order 12291 on Federal Regulations. It has beendetermined that this is not a major rule. The rule itself will not havean effect of $100 million or more on the economy, substantially increaseprices or costs for consumer, industry, or State or local governments,nor adversely affect competition, employment, investment, productivity,innovation, or the ability of United States-based enterprises to competein foreign markets.This rule has been considered in light of the Regulatory Flexibility Act,5 U.S.C. 601 et seq., and it has been determined that this action willnot have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of smallentities.This rule will not result in additional paperwork not already approvedfor use. Therefore, the review provision of the Paperwork Reduction Actof 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3507) and implementing regulations at 5 CFR part 1320do not apply.This rule has been determined not to have taking implications for privateproperty for purposes of Executive Order 12630 concerning ``GovernmentActions and Interference With Constitutionally Protected Property Rights.''<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 36 CFR Part 292</ITAG>Recreation, Recreation areas.Therefore, for the reasons set forth in the preamble, part 292 of chapterII of title 36 of the Code of Federal Regulations is hereby amended byestablishing a new Subpart F to read as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 292_NATIONAL RECREATION AREAS</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="72">Subpart F_Hells Canyon National Recreation Areas</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="70">Sec.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">292.40 Purpose and scope.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">292.41 Definitions.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">292.42 Comprehensive management plan.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">292.43 Management standards and guidelines.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority: </T4>Sec. 10, Public Law 94-199 (16 U.S.C. 460gg-7); 16U.S.C. 551; 16 U.S.C. 1281(d).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="52">Subpart F_Hells Canyon National Recreation Area</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 292.40</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Purpose and scope.</ITAG>(a) The rules of this subpart govern management of the National ForestSystem lands that comprise the Hells Canyon National Recreation Area locatedin the Wallowa-Whitman, Nezperce, Payette National Forests in the Statesof Idaho and Oregon as established by the Act of December 31, 1975, asamended (89 Stat. 1117; 16 U.S.C. 460gg).(b) Other rules of this chapter that govern management of National ForestSystem lands and resources, as well as direction issued through the ForestService Manual and Handbooks (36 CFR part 200), also apply to managementof the Recreation Area.
