Here are answers to somequestions on the latest unrest.   Q. Why are there new riots in South Korea? Haven't elections anddemocratic reforms in recent months produced substantial changes?   A. Many of the authoritarian controls on politics and many otheraspects of South Korean life have been dismantled in recent months.The small, but powerful radical movement contends there has been nochange and remains determined to overthrow a government it claimsis a dictatorship. Radicals are fighting for an ill-defined``democracy of the masses.''   The well-organized radical movement, which evolved during yearsof resistance to authoritarian rule, has become increasinglyleftist and violent as it has split with moderate opposition forcesover political goals in recent months.   Q. Most of the protesters are described as students. Who arethey and what do they want?   A. Radical college students are the main strength of the protestmovement. They constitute up to 10 percent of college students,with perhaps another 10 percent sympathizing with their ideas andaims.   Many radical students are idealists seeking a perfect society ina nation dominated for most of its 40 years by military andcivilian dictators. They see themselves as champions of workers,peasants and the poor.   The radicals have little understanding of politics or ideology,partly because of strict government controls in the past onpolitical education. They talk about true democracy and sharingwealth, but are vague or inarticulate on how to achieve their goals.   Q. How serious is the unrest?   A. The radicals lack public support and are not a serious threatto the government, but they are capable of causing trouble byviolent tactics. The main problem is that they are helping continuethe confrontational nature of Korean politics.   Q. Why have the latest protests been mainly anti-American.Didn't the United States help the South during the Korean War?   A. Radical students contend successive authoritarian governmentshave been able to rule the country because of U.S. backing.Students say the United States as a democracy has failed to pushfor democracy in South Korea and other nations.   The radicals also claim the United States enforces partition ofthe divided Korean Peninsula to control the South. The intenselynationalistic students resent the presence of 42,000 U.S. troops inSouth Korea and oppose the growing impact of American culturalinfluence. But the resentment aimed at the U.S. government has sofar had little impact on individual Americans.   Q. How do the majority of the Korean people feel about theUnited States and about the radicals' anti-Americanism?   A. Most South Koreans are not anti-American. A majority arebelieved to support the presence of U.S. forces as a defenseagainst communist North Korea.   But there is a growing belief among South Koreans that theUnited States tends to patronize its weaker Korean ally. Thispartly reflects the Koreans' growing prosperity and confidence andtheir desire for a bigger voice in the world. U.S. trade pressureto open up South Korea's markets to American imports has alsostirred resentment.   Q. The students tried to march to the North Korean border forreunification talks. Is reunification possible?   A. Radical students, who insist they are not communists, sayreunification must be achieved at once. They claim the governmentsin the north and the south will be swept away and the peninsulareunited if the ordinary people of both nations simply join hands.   But many South Koreans fear the North wants to impose communistrule. The North invaded the South in 1950 and the two nationstechnically remain at war since no peace treaty was signed.   There seems to be little hope of reunification while the Northremains one of the most repressive communist regimes in the worldand the South becomes one of the fastest growing pro-Westerncapitalist nations. The peninsula was divided in 1945 when U.S. andSoviet forces ended the Japanese occupation at the end of World WarII.   Q. Do the new protests pose a threat to the Summer Olympics inSeoul in September?   A. Some radicals are backing North Korea's demand to be aco-host of the Games as a way of promoting reunification. TheInternational Olympic Committee and South Korea have rejected theNorth's demand.   The South Korean government is determined to make the Games amajor success and any attempt to disrupt them would be suppressedby a huge security shield. But radicals may try to stage protestssince world attention will be focused on South Korea.</TEXT></DOC>
