Thismodel is also capable of estimating the magnitude of shale swelling whensubject to humidity changes. The model was developed on a basis of themoisture susceptibility of the shale and the initial humidity of theventilated mine air. The Moisture Activity Index (I/sub RH/) was selectedto describe the susceptibility of shale to moisture because of its closeassociation with the other physical properties, its strong correlationwith the swelling of the shale, and because it can be defined by relativelysimple laboratory testing procedure.</TEXT></DOC>
