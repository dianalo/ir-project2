The unions charged Friday that the Pittsburgh Press Co., whichpublishes both newspapers under a joint operating agreement, woulduse a strike as an excuse to close the Post-Gazette and give themorning newspaper market to the larger Press.   Pittsburgh Press Co. accepted a late offer by 10 unionsrepresenting about 1,400 non-editorial workers to continueoperations under current contract language on 48 hours' notice of astrike ``so long as good-faith negotiations continue.''   The company earlier this week had offered a 30-day extension ofcurrent contracts. Company spokesman Randall P. Notter said nonegotiations would be held until next week.   Pittsburgh Press Co. publishes the afternoon Press and morningPost-Gazette under a 1961 joint operating agreement allowingindependent editorial staffs but shared advertising, printing andcirculation departments.   The union's offer came after both newspapers vowed Friday tocontinue to publish daily if their joint operating company wasstruck at midnight Saturday.   Joe Pass, attorney for Teamsters Local 211, the largest of the 10unions, charged it was ``obvious and self-evident that the plan ofThe Pittsburgh Press is to force a strike.''   Pass said the Press, owned by Scripps Howard Newspapers, would``buy out'' Post-Gazette Publisher William Block for the remainingyears of the joint operating agreement, which continues until Dec.31, 1999.   The Pittsburgh Press Co. said the Post-Gazette's ``existence isassured'' through the joint operating agreement and the newspaper``is not an issue in these negotiations.''   Pass said the two sides differ on company proposals to ``change(working) conditions and practices that have gone on for 50 years.''He said the proposals involved work rules and job security issues.   The Teamsters local represents 442 drivers and mechanics and 238circulation employees.   The company's other unionized employees include more than 400composing room, financial and advertising workers represented byPittsburgh Typographers Union Local 7, 180 members of Mailers UnionLocal 22, and 155 members of Graphic Communications InternationalUnion Pressmen Local 9. Other union employees who are negotiatinginclude photo engravers, electricians, machinists, paperhandlers,janitors and engineers.   The Press has an average paid circulation of 229,539 daily and554,685 on Sunday, and the Post-Gazette has an average paidcirculation of 168,123 daily, except Sunday, according to thePost-Gazette.   Post-Gazette editors and reporters, who are members of NewspaperGuild Local 61, are working under a three-year contract that expiresDec. 31, 1990.
