Barrett   Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DATE>10/23/91</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A16</SO><GV>CONGRESS (CNG)</GV><RE>NORTH AMERICA (NME)UNITED STATES (US)</RE><LP>   WASHINGTON -- The House passed an anti-crime bill thatwould expand the federal death penalty and increase spendingfor local law enforcement and state prisons.   The package, approved 305-118, differs in several aspectsfrom legislation passed by the Senate in July. Lawmakers mustiron out those differences in a conference before sending abill to President Bush.</LP><TEXT>   The major point of contention at the conference probablywill be how much to curb state prisoners' rights to fileappeals in federal courts on constitutional grounds. TheHouse version would limit the availability of these so-calledhabeas corpus petitions in many cases. The Senate version, incontrast, would in effect eliminate these appeals, accordingto Democratic lawmakers. President Bush favors the morestringent approach.   Last year, both houses passed anti-crime bills, butconferees were unable to work out compromises; the finalpackage was stripped of its most controversial provisions,including those limiting habeas corpus petitions.   Compromise is somewhat more likely this year. For onething, the House passed death-penalty provisions similar tothose approved in the Senate. Both versions would expand thefederal death penalty to cover 50 additional crimes,including murder of high government officials, espionage andcertain drug crimes. The House, as the Senate did earlier,struck from its bill language that would have allowed adefendant to avoid execution if he could prove that capitalpunishment had been applied in a racially disproportionatefashion in that jurisdiction.   The passage of the death-penalty provisions, stripped of a&quot;racial justice&quot; defense, is a major victory for PresidentBush, who has made capital punishment a centerpiece of hisanti-crime program. Eager to appear just as &quot;tough&quot; asRepublicans, most Democrats supported the death-penaltyprovisions.   Both houses also have passed variations of a weeklongmandatory waiting period for handgun purchases. Mr. Bush hassaid he will sign such a gun-control provision only ifCongress presents him with death-penalty and habeas corpusmeasures to his liking. The Senate passed a ban on nine typesof semi-automatic &quot;assault&quot; weapons; the House rejected asimilar provision.   The House bill includes a broader exception to theso-called exclusionary rule, under which judges preventillegally gathered evidence from being admitted in court. TheSenate version would allow admission of such evidence whenpolice made a &quot;good faith&quot; mistake but did seek a searchwarrant. The House version would apply even when policedidn't get a warrant.</TEXT></DOC>
