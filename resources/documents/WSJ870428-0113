The nation's options exchanges want to know why they've been left out of the party.    Options market executives were surprised to discover earlier this month that when Japanese institutions were allowed by the Japanese government to trade futures and options on futures, they weren't granted the right to trade options on securities as well.    &quot;The Ministry of Finance told me they didn't include security options because they didn't understand them. They said they were going to study them for three to six months,&quot; said one exasperated options exchange official, who asked not to be named.    The three leading options exchanges are turning to the Securities and Exchange Commission for help. Officials from the Chicago Board Options Exchange, the American Stock Exchange and the Philadelphia Stock Exchange placed a conference call to SEC officials yesterday to ask the agency, which regulates security options, to help them lobby Japanese authorities to try and speed the approval process.    The exchange executives plan to speak with SEC officials again today and hope that SEC Chairman John Shad will write a letter to the Ministry of Finance, saying that the options markets have been left at a competitive disadvantage to U.S. futures markets as a result of the decision, the exchange official said.    In Washington, Richard Ketchum, the SEC's market regulation director, confirmed that one of his top aides, Brandon Becker, conferred with the exchange officials.    &quot;We're reviewing the Japanese action,&quot; Mr. Ketchum said. &quot;There doesn't seem to be any particular reason to distinguish between options on securities . . . and futures on securities.&quot;    SEC officials are considering whether it would be &quot;appropriate&quot; for the agency to become involved in the matter, Mr. Ketchum added.    Kenneth Leibler, Amex president, said, &quot;We're obviously disappointed that the Japanese government didn't include options on securities, which we believe are the economic equivalent of options on futures.&quot;    He speculated that the Japanese government's decision may have been based &quot;partially on an oversight and partially on unfamiliarity.&quot; He noted that the Japanese have an active futures market but aren't active security options traders.    &quot;Ultimately, I think we will be included,&quot; he added.    CBOE and Philadelphia exchange officials couldn't be reached.    Leo Melamed, special counsel to the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, which is expected to reap increased stock-index and foreign currency futures business from the Japanese, said, &quot;It appears they're drawing the line between retail and institutional business.&quot; He said that Japanese officials consider futures to be a product used mainly by institutions, but that they view options as being for retail investors.    Japan's Ministry of Finance allowed institutions to trade futures and options on futures earlier this month, but indicated that individuals wouldn't be granted similar liberties for at least a year. </TEXT></DOC>
