(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A commuter plane that plowed through astand of trees just after taking off, killing 12, was only 3 yearsold and had just been inspected, the company president saidSaturday.   At least nine other people died in plane crashes Friday andSaturday in New Jersey, Texas, California and Connecticut. One manwas missing and presumed dead.   American Eagle commuter Flight 3378 had just taken off fromRaleigh-Durham Airport at Morrisville, N.C., on a flight toRichmond, Va., when it disappeared from radar and crashed about3,000 feet from the runway, officials said.   ``It sounded like a blast or something ...,'' said Mary H. Ward,who lives in a mobile home about three miles from the airport. ``Itwasn't too awful loud. It was kind of muffled.''   ``The airplane is completely disintegrated,'' deputy airportdirector R.C. Shackleford said Saturday.   The plane apparently skimmed just over the surface of Beir Lake,a flood-control reservoir that laps around the end of the runway,and hit an earthen bank before crashing through tall pine trees.   Some trees were broken off and others were skinned as much as200 yards beyond the lake. Shackleford said the wreckage, with noneof the pieces more than 8 feet long, was scattered over about anacre.   ``We don't know what happened,'' Shackleford said. ``Anythinganybody tells you or anything you deduce is pure speculation.''   ``There was no indication to the tower that the plane was in anydanger prior to takeoff,'' said Teresa Damiano, public affairsmanager for the airport.   An investigative team from the National Transportation SafetyBoard arrived Saturday from Washington, and two officials with thestate medical examiner's office in Chapel Hill were on the scene,Ms. Damiano said.   Donald Paschall, chief of airport security, said the crash wasreported at 9:27 p.m. Friday by a guard at a nearby constructionsite.   ``He just reported a loud crash and a ball of fire,'' Paschallsaid.   The victims were two crew members and 10 passengers, most fromNorth Carolina and Virginia.   The deaths were the first fatalities in eight years of operationby AVAir, American Eagle's parent company, said Larry Rednour, thecompany's executive vice president.   ``Our shock is all that much greater because this was a seasonedcrew operating their first flight of the day,'' Glenn Schaab,president and chief executive officer of AVAir, said in a statementissued Saturday. ``They were in a plane less than 3 years old,which had undergone scheduled maintenance and inspection thisweek.''   And the pilot, Capt. Walter Cole, last week took a test flightperiodically required for commercial pilots. ``He passed withoutany problem at all,'' Rednour said.   The airplane was a Swearingen SW-4 twin-engine turboprop.   A twin-engine plane of the same type crashed last month inColorado, killing nine people on a ski vacation. The plane was notrequired to have cockpit voice recorders or flight data recorders,said James P. Burke, a member of the NTSB investigative teamassigned to that crash.   Elsewhere, three people were killed when a small plane crashedin a wooded area about two miles from the airport at Atlantic City,N.J., after a flight from Norwood, Mass.   Kathleen Bergen, a Federal Aviation Administration spokeswoman,said the twin-engine Piper Navajo disappeared from radar in densefog and driving rain shortly after 10 p.m. Friday.   Airport fire and rescue crews found the plane about an hourlater and worked throughout the night to remove the bodies, Ms.Bergen said. They were hampered by the weather and deep woods.   In Big Bear City, Calif., a pilot and a passenger were killedwhen their small plane, practicing rollovers near the campsite of achurch group, crashed Saturday in the San Bernardino Mountains,authorities said.   No one on the ground was injured when the single-engineBeechcraft Muskateer hit the ground at 3:15 p.m. near Dead Man'sLake and Onyx Summit, said Jim Bryant, spokesman for the SanBernardino County Sheriff's Department.   In El Paso, Texas, a twin-engine plane skimmed over morningrush-hour traffic and crashed on a freeway access road, killing allthree people aboard and spewing flaming debris that destroyed twoparked cars, authorities said.   ``It looked like it was going to attempt maybe to come onto thefreeway, but as soon as it got over the freeway, it justnosedived,'' said motorist Victor Armendariz.   The Gulfstream Commander 680 went down in moderate snow andlight fog after takeoff Friday from El Paso International Airport,NTSB spokesman Tommy McFall said.   The pilot ``was still in radio contact with the tower,'' NTSBspokesman Tommy McFall said of the pilot. ``The pilot said that hewas having trouble with the landing gear and was coming back to theairport.''   A small cargo plane operated by U.S. Express went down in LongIsland Sound off Stratford, Conn., early Saturday. One body wasfound and authorities called in divers to help search for the bodyof a second man, said Stratford police Sgt. Andrew Knapp.   The search was called off in the afternoon and there were noplans to resume it, Coast Guard Petty Officer Roberto M. Ramossaid. Authorities said the man was presumed dead.   The plane was en route from Albany, N.Y., to Boston, with ascheduled refueling stop at Bridgeport, Conn., authorities said.   Besides the pilot, the victims of the North Carolina crash wereidentified by AVAir as 1st Officer Kathy Digan; Glenn Bogitsh andLibby Bogitsh, both of Nashville, Tenn.; Terry Bower, Mike Grindle,John Oliver, Richard W. Ross and Marcia Ferris, all of Richmond;Henry Lewis, U.S. Army stationed at Fort Lee in Richmond; ChrisWells of the Raleigh, N.C., area; and Roger Wilcox of Florida.
