The paper emphasizesthe results of a recent comprehensive geological/engineering study wherea detailed volumetric and mass balance analyses were carried out to pinpointthe recoverable reserves under the existing operating conditions. Theresults available today demonstrate that the existing wells will adequatelydrain the proved gas reserves, and consequently inlet gas compressionhas to be installed in order to meet the contractual demand-rate andto increase the ultimate gas recovery as well. In addition, the paperoffers a brief summary about the gas plant components, the piping system,and the operating methodology.</TEXT></DOC>
