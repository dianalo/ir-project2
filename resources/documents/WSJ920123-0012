The Nasdaq Composite Index leapt 15.81, or 2.61%, to620.68 -- just below its intraday high. The action was insharp contrast to Tuesday, when it plunged 14.51.</LP><TEXT>   The market gains were broad-based. Advancing issuesswamped decliners, 1,459-to-743, as 131 issues climbed to newhighs and only 11 fell to new lows. Total OTC volume eased,however, to 251.2 million shares from 265.4 million Tuesday.   Traders said both institutions and individual investorsbid shares higher, particularly issues in the recentlybattered computer technology, biotechnology andhealth-related industry groups.   Profit-taking had depressed the technology and medicalsegments in recent days as investors shifted some of theirinvestment capital to industry groups expected to performwell in an economic recovery later this year.   But that selling came to a screeching halt yesterday.&quot;There was a complete change of sentiment,&quot; said HediReynolds, head of OTC trading at Morgan Keegan andamp; Co. &quot;Thesellers {no longer felt} there was any urgency to sell andthe buyers were afraid they were going to miss out&quot; on arenewed rally, she said.   Shares of software developer Microsoft, which hadn't hadan advance since closing at a 52-week high of 131 1/2 lastWednesday, soared 6 1/8 to 125 1/2. Elsewhere, three healthcare-related new issues came to market and closed well abovetheir offering prices.   The new-issues market sizzled, as newly public Ventritexsoared $12 from its offering price of $18 a share to close at$30. The size of Ventritex's offering, for example, wasincreased to 4.6 million shares from 2.7 million and itsoffering price raised from an originally expected $13 ashare. Another five companies went public yesterday, right onthe heels of six new offerings Tuesday.   Investors in Ventritex are making a big bet that a federaladvisory panel will give a green light to the Sunnyvale,Calif., company's first major product when the panel convenesearly next month. Ventritex has developed an electronicdefribrillator designed to prevent lethal ventricularfibrillation in some 100,000 cardiac patients each year whosurvive episodes of &quot;sudden cardiac death.&quot; The product is anelectronic device implanted in a patient's abdomen, isdesigned to monitor a patient's heartbeat and will deliverelectrical shocks to the heart to stop ventricularfibrillation.   The company, which has implanted 540 of its Cadencedefribrillators in patients during trials of the product, isseeking clearance for the product from a Food and DrugAdministration advisory panel in the first week of February.   Ventritex looks like a risky bet. Since its inception in1985, the company's losses have mounted as it poured fundsinto research and development: for fiscal 1991, ended inJune, it had a loss of $6.5 million on revenue of $7 million.Ventritex also has some stiff competition: Medtronic is dueto go before the same FDA advisory panel on Feb. 3 forclearance of a similar product.   Eli Lilly andamp; Co. also is in the same field.   But investors such as Charles Mangum, manager of the $190million Fidelity Select Medical Delivery Fund, say they'rewilling to bet that Ventritex will win approval and be theonly &quot;pure play&quot; among makers of implantable defribrillators.Mr. Mangum, who says he bought some shares both before theoffering and during yesterday's feverish trading, says he's along-term investor.   &quot;It's a fantastic story,&quot; he says, pointing out that eachdefribrillator costs about $20,000 per patient. If theproduct is approved, he expects the company to generate about$100 million a year by fiscal 1993 and earn about $1.15 ashare by the fiscal year ending in June 1994. He concedes,however, that Ventritex's newly issued shares could plummetif the panel hearing doesn't go well.   Among other hot new stocks yesterday, Gilead Sciencesjumped to 20 1/4, up 5 1/4 from its offering price of $15apiece, and was the day's most active OTC issue as 5.2million shares changed hands. The size of the offering wasincreased to five million shares from three million and theoffering price raised from an originally expected $12 to $14apiece. The Foster City, Calif., company said that it isdeveloping a new class of pharmaceuticals based on&quot;nucleotides,&quot; a class of molecules that can be chemicallychanged to inhibit the production or activity ofdisease-causing proteins.

PhyCor, a Nashville, Tenn., provider of services formedical clinics, climbed 1 to 17 from its offering price of$16 each. The size of the offering was raised to 2,350,000shares from an originally planned two million shares.   The market isn't hot for all IPOs, however. Fleet Call, afledgling paging and dispatch services concern, rescheduledan initial offering that was postponed in December, Dow JonesProfessional Investor Report said. The company, however, nowplans to sell just 7.5 million shares, rather than 11 millionshares, at about $15 to $16 apiece, rather than theoriginally planned $18 to $20 a share.
