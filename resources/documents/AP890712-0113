Thousands of homes remained withoutpower today   Monday's violent storms cut a swath of destruction from northernNew Jersey to central Massachusetts. The tornadoes were blamed forthe death of a 12-year-old girl in Connecticut who was camping whena tree fell on her tent, and for injuries suffered by hundreds.   At least 50 homes and 40 businesses were demolished in oneConnecticut community, while 24 condominium apartments in a New Yorktown were shattered.   A heat wave in the Midwest, meanwhile, brought temperatures inthe 90s for the second day Tuesday, but a ``cooling center'' waslargely ignored in St. Louis, where a second heat-related death wasreported this week.   Thunderstorms chased the heat in northern Illinois, but lightningstruck three people, injuring two critically. The storms alsospawned tornadoes near Kankakee, Ill., and at Indianapolis andFairland, Ind., where twisters damaged an apartment complex, theNational Weather Service said. No injuries were reported.   A storm also closed Chicago's O'Hare International Airport for 40minutes Tuesday afternoon. Flight operations were back to normalTuesday night.   Gusts of 75 mph blew a DC-3 airplane into a hanger at Fort Wayne,Ind., the weather service said.   Today, water stood up to 3 feet deep in sections of Kansas afterheavy rain fell during the night, the weather service said. Parts ofeastern Kansas got over 3 inches of rain, and 6 inches fell atMcFarland, and Emporia had water standing 3 feet deep on low-lyingsections of some roads, it said.   Locally heavy rain also fell on sections of southern Nebraska andsouthern Iowa, with 3.15 inches in two hours at Ottumwa, Iowa.   In the Northeast, the weather service was waiting to investigatethe destruction before confirming that tornadoes hit the region, butFort Lee, N.J., police Capt. Thomas Pierson had no doubts.   ``When something like that comes through, I call it a tornado,even without Dorothy and Toto,'' he said. Damage to 18 New Jerseycommunities was estimated at $2 million.   In Connecticut, the damage was far worse _ estimated in the tensof millions of dollars.   Gov. William A. O'Neill viewed the destruction by helicopter andcar. He declared a state of emergency Tuesday and asked PresidentBush for federal assistance.   Hamden, Conn., was hardest-hit.   Earthmovers roared into the city to clear a path through fallentrees and utility poles in a 30-square-block area. The governor'smotorcade weaved through the streets to avoid the debris.   ``It looks like a war zone,'' said Sen. Christopher J. Dodd,D-Conn., who toured the area with O'Neill. ``It looks like a streetin London during the blitz.''   Police using dogs to sniff through demolished buildings inHamden, which is about 30 miles south of Hartford, found sevenpeople trapped in three collapsed buildings, said Public SafetyCommissioner Lester J. Forst. He said they were taken from thebuildings unhurt. State health officials said about 250 peoplesuffered minor injuries.   ``It becomes more and more of a miracle that more people weren'tinjured or even killed,'' O'Neill said.   Mayor John Carusone estimated damage at $50 million.   He said at least 50 homes and at least 40 businesses weredemolished or so heavily damaged they must be torn down.   More than 36,000 utility customers in the state remained withoutpower today. Northeast Utilities said all but about 5,000 customerswould have power by midnight tonight, and United Illuminating saidservice would be restored to most customers today.   In Waterbury and Hamden, some looting was reported. Statetroopers and National Guardsmen patrolled Hamden's streets.   Damage in Bantam, a section of the town of Litchfield, covered asquare mile, officials said. Among the buildings destroyed were anhistoric church, the post office, the only service station and theborough meeting house.   In New York, Putnam County Executive Peter Alexanderson declareda state of emergency for the county. He estimated damage at $20million.   At one condominium complex in Carmel, about 50 miles north of NewYork City, officials determined that 24 apartments would have to betorn down and 36 repaired.   When it started to rain Monday night, Ellen Wheat called in hercats.   ``I tried to shut the door; I couldn't do it,'' she said. ``Iheard noises and I looked where the staircase was. The roof wasgone.''   The cats were still missing Tuesday, and her second-floorbedrooms have no roof or front wall.</TEXT></DOC>
