The London tabloid Daily Star paid about 25,000 British pounds($39,750) for the series of pictures, outbidding about nine rivals,Edward Hung, group general manager of the Sing Tao Newspapers, saidtoday.   British reporters flooded the newspaper's offices after thepictures appeared in the Wednesday edition of the Sing Tao Wan Pao,a Chinese-language afternoon newspaper.   ``It was crazy,'' said Hung. ``It was a madhouse.''   A photographer for the local Chinese-language newspaperpositioned atop an adjacent hotel had snapped the pictures earlyWednesday.   The photographs showed the princess, wearing a red one-piecebathing suit, diving into the pool and swimming backstroke. Anothershot showed her walking barefoot outside the pool with a whitetowel wrapped around her body.   A picture of Diana swimming backstroke covered nearly the entirefront page of today's edition of the Daily Star under the headline``Di in Peril.''   The newspaper claimed that the ability of the photographer totake such pictures showed ``gaping holes'' in her security.</TEXT></DOC>
