According to our model,GCL is a low-energy jet emanating from the H/sub II/ gas disk extendingbeyond r {similar_to} 100 pc from the galactic center. The model is basedon the 'sweeping-magnetic-twist' mechanism developed by the authors forthe production of cosmic jets, where the gas in the surface layer ofthe contracting disk is lifted up by the J x B force in the relaxingmagnetic twist, which is generated by the interaction of the rotationof the contracting disk with the poloidal magnetic field. We incorporatethe realistic gravitational potential suitable for the galactic centerregion, in which the rotational velocities are approximately constantfor r = 20 - 100 pc. The difference between the models with this realisticpotential and those with the potential due to a point mass is examinedin detail. On the basis of the numerical results, we present a scenariofor the formation of the GCL.</TEXT></DOC>
