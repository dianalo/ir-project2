Swiss food manufacturers Nestle SA and Jacobs Suchard SA saidseparately Thursday that each had increased its respective stake inYork-based Rowntree, maker of the Kit Kat candy bar.   CBI director general John Banham stated that Swiss regulationsstopped British companies from easily bidding for Swiss companiesand that a Swiss takeover of Rowntree therefore should be blocked.   ``We can't safely continue to play football against teams whichhave built brick walls across their own goals and expect to win,''said Banham.   Nestle last week launched a hostile $3.9 billion bid to acquireRowntree. Suchard at the same time said it also had acquired astake in Rowntree.   Nestle stated Thursday it had hiked its stake in Rowntree to 7.1percent from 6.7 percent to 7.1 percent.   Suchard said it had hiked its stake to 25.4 percent from 23.5percent, but it has not indicated whether it plans to launch a fulltakeover bid for Rowntree.   Another British company, Cadbury Schweppes PLC, is the target ofa possible bid from the U.S. leisure group General Cinema Corp. inwhat has been dubbed by London newspapers as the candy ``bar wars.''   General Cinema said last week it would raise its 17.7 percentstake in Cadbury, whose products include Peter Paul candy bars suchas Mounds and Almond Joy.   Cadbury Chairman Sir Adrian Cadbury has called on the governmentto intervene against a hostile takeover.   The raids on Cadbury and Rowntree, which are Britain's two topconfectioners and are major players in the world market, havesparked controversy in Britain.   Press reports said the government's decision to investigate theKuwaiti government's acquisition of a 22 percent stake in oil giantBritish Petroleum Co. PLC had led to speculation that it might takesimilar action over Rowntree.   The government's Department of Trade and Industry said Wednesdayit would refer the acquisition by the Kuwait Investment Office tothe Monopolies and Merger Commission. The commission will rulewithin four months whether or not the Kuwaiti stake in BP,Britain's biggest company, is in the public interest.</TEXT></DOC>
