John D. Fry, 41-year-old president and chief operating officer, and Francis P. Massco, general counsel, resigned over what Wheeling-Pittsburgh termed a salary dispute. Their departure was the latest sign of management turmoil at the steelmaker, which filed for bankruptcy-law protection two years ago.    Last month, George A. Ferris, vice chairman and chief executive officer, abruptly resigned. The 70-year-old Mr. Ferris, a retired Ford Motor Co. vice president, hadn't hinted of any plans to leave the company.    Lloyd C. Lubensky, chairman, said in a statement that yesterday's resignations resulted from &quot;disagreement with the board concerning procedures used in granting certain increases in executive compensation several months ago without full board approval.&quot;    Messrs. Fry and Lubensky couldn't be reached for comment. Ronald Orr, an attorney representing Wheeling-Pittsburgh, declined to elaborate on the resignations.    Signs of impending management change surfaced in early January when Allan E. Paulson resigned as chairman and sold his 34.2% stake to Mr. Lubensky, a close friend, for a mere $100,000. The stock, purchased in 1983 for an estimated $50 million, had an indicated value of $13.5 million at the time. Mr. Paulson, who is also chairman of Chrysler Corp.'s Gulfstream Aerospace unit, said he sold the stake to take advantage of more favorable tax treatment under the 1986 tax law.    Though Mr. Lubensky was expected to succeed Mr. Paulson, directors delayed naming a new chairman. Then, in February, the board sidestepped the issue by placing in charge a three-member executive committee comprised of Messrs. Lubensky and Ferris and John P. Innes, a director and former Gulfstream executive. Almost as abruptly, directors named Mr. Lubensky chairman last month and accepted Mr. Ferris's resignation.    Wheeling-Pittsburgh said it named Richard E. Stoll, a vice president, interim chief operating officer and J.M. Little, a Houston attorney and a friend of Mr. Innes, interim general counsel. &quot;It's not easy to get a general counsel at this stage of a bankruptcy proceeding,&quot; Mr. Orr said. &quot;He's really doing us a favor.&quot;    Mr. Fry was generally well regarded within the industry. &quot;He was a superior manager with strong operating talents, and he had the confidence of his staff,&quot; said Peter F. Marcus, steel analyst for PaineWebber Inc. Mr. Fry's $138,667 in compensation last year made him Wheeling-Pittsburgh's second highest-paid executive behind Mr. Ferris, who earned $322,348.    The upheaval in Wheeling-Pittsburgh's executive suite comes as the steelmaker labors under court supervision as part of Chapter 11 bankruptcy-law proceedings. Irking creditors, the company has obtained court permission seven times to extend deadlines for filing a reorganization plan. The current deadline is June 9.    &quot;The banks are impatient with the company's progress in formulating a plan of reorganization,&quot; said Dennis Cronin, an attorney representing the steelmaker's lenders.    Under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, a company is shielded from creditors while it attempts to reorganize. </TEXT></DOC>
