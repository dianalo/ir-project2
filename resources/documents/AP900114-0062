The low-volume wagon is one of three car models now beingassembled at the plant. The Caprice and the Cadillac Brougham arethe others.   GM officials said assembly of the Custom Cruiser will be movedto its Willow Run, Mich., plant, where the automaker isconsolidating production of station wagons for the Chevrolet, Buickand Pontiac lines.   The move won't affect employment at the plant, a union officialsaid.   Elimination of the Custom Cruiser not only leaves more room forCaprice and Brougham production but also could clear the way forbuilding the new Buick Roadmaster in Arlington in 1991 as a1992-model car, the Fort Worth Star-Telegram reported.   The Roadmaster and a new Cadillac model are scheduled forproduction as derivatives of the Caprice's GM300 platform. The newCaprice is an aeordynamic version of the large, rear-wheel-drivecar it replaces.   The Arlington plant is being considered for production of thetwo models, the Star-Telegram reported.</TEXT></DOC>
