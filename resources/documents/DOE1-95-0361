<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-95-0361 </DOCNO><TEXT>A compact resonant loop antenna is installed on the ORNL Radio FrequencyTest Facility (RFTF). Facility characteristics include a steady-statemagnetic field of {approx_equal}0.5 T at the antenna, microwave-generatedplasmas with n/sub e/{approx_equal}10{sup 12} cm{sup -3} and T/sub e/{approx_equal}8eV, and 100 kW of 25-MHz rf power. The antenna is tunable from {similar_to}22--75MHz, is designed to handle {ge}1 MW of rf power, and can be moved 5 cmwith respect to the port flange. Antenna characteristics reported anddiscussed include the effect of magnetic field on rf voltage breakdownat the capacitor, the effects of magnetic field and plasma on rf voltagebreakdown between the radiating element and the Faraday shield, the effectsof graphite on Faraday shield losses, and the efficiency of couplingto the plasma.</TEXT></DOC>
