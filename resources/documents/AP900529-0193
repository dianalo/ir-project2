It has been a long, hard march for one of Burma's many ethnicminorities, most of it backward. At the beginning, in the late1940s, Karen troops swept through Burma's major cities and evenpenetrated to the outskirts of Rangoon, the capital.   In the past two years, the army has overrun most of the Karenbases along the Thai border and sent 28,000 refugees fleeing acrossthe frontier.   Thailand, eager to exploit Burma's rich forests, has struckdeals with the government at the expense of the rebels. Hundreds offighters have died on both sides in fierce jungle combat, sometimeshand-to-hand.   The opposition won the Burmese national elections last weekend,but it is not certain how that will affect the Karen war or whenthe military government will relinquish power.   Among the last Karen strongholds is the border town ofManerplaw, capital of territory the Karen call Kawtoolei.   Manerplaw, probably one of the world's most idyllic guerrillabases, sits on the Moei River, at the foot of mist-streaked hills.   Its neat wood-and-thatch buildings house 12 governmentdepartments of the Karen National Union, including foreign affairs,fisheries and mining. Karen leaders claim to command 10,000 troopsand govern 1 million civilians.   The Karen fighters and a dozen other rebellious ethnicminorities with which they are allied do not seek independence, butgreater political and cultural autonomy.   ``If you consider it historically, it is the worst situation wehave faced, but it doesn't mean the end of the Karen revolution,''said Ba Thein, general secretary of the Karen National Union.   He said the Karen were switching to more classic-style guerrillawarfare and would have little trouble operating in areas of easternBurma dominated by the Karen minority. A ``mobile headquarters''would be organized if Manerplaw fell to the Burmese, he said in aninterview.   Ba Thein also expressed hope for internal political change inBurma.   ``We are not alone,'' he said. ``All the people in Burma arestruggling for freedom. We believe that, if democracy comes, allthe ethnic minority problems with be solved.''   Burma's military, which brutally crushed a pro-democracyuprising in 1988, has shown remarkable tenacity.   The loss of border bases has greatly reduced the Karen NationalUnion's income from taxes levied on frontier smuggling, which wasused to buy weapons.   In contrast, the 200,000-member Burmese military has restockedits arsenal with funds from teak-logging concessions granted toThai businessmen.   Burmese control of the border is now in the interest of powerfulThais, and rebel officers say some Thai-Burmese militarycooperation has occurred.   ``The logging has been the death knell of the Karen,'' said aknowledgeable Western observer in Bangkok. He noted that earlierfriendly and mutually advantageous ties between the Thais and Karenhad helped sustain the insurgency.   What some sympathetic Westerners and Thais have called the``sellout of the Karen'' fits a historical pattern.   Although the Karen have lived in what is now Burma at least aslong as the Burmans, they have been suppressed and looked down uponas ``savages'' and ``wild cattle of the hills.''   The Karen fought bravely alongside the Allies in World War II,while a pro-Japanese government sat in Rangoon, but promises ofsome autonomy were broken when Burma gained independence fromBritain in 1947.   After the early successes of their insurgency, the tide turnedagainst the Karen rebels and they were gradually forced into theborder region.   There has been incompetence and some corruption among the agingrebel leaders, who have not conducted a real guerrilla war, anddisparities in power and education between the Christian leadersand their followers, most of whom are Buddhist or animist.   In 1984, the government stepped up its campaign and three yearslater announced it would destroy the Karen National Union withintwo years. That has not happened, but two words often heard whenthe rebels discuss the future are ``dark'' and ``bleak.''   ``I am 63 and have fought all my life,'' Ba Thein said. ``Mychildren have now joined the revolution. Perhaps the nextgeneration will also have to struggle.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv PMs Wednesday May 30</NOTE></DOC>
