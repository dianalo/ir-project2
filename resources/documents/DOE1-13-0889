This paper examines theconjugate gradient method used in conjunction with the generalized andapproximate polynomial preconditionings for solving such linear systems.An approximate polynomial preconditioning is introduced, and is shownto be more efficient than the generalized polynomial preconditionings.This new technique provides a simple but effective preconditioning polynomial,which is based on another coefficient matrix rather than the originalmatrix operator as commonly used.</TEXT></DOC>
