Most of the emigres, who had never been able to study orpublicly practice their religion before, had a lot of learning to do.;    Butduring this Passover, which began on Friday and continues throughout the week,the learning goes both ways. As the newly arrived Jews have learned more abouttheir religion, they have also become more eager to preserve the best of theculture they have left behind.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Religion andamp; Ethics  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  PASSOVER A TIME TO LEARN, SHARE FOR SOVIETJEWS  </HEADLINE><TEXT>     Virtually every emigre family in Santa Clara County has been linked withlocal Jewish families to celebrate first- and second-night Seders. And onSunday, San Jose's Temple Emanu-El will host a festive Seder especially foremigres.;    The 6 p.m. community Seder at Temple-Emanuel is the hottestticket in town among the emigres, Jarkov says. After Rabbi Jonathan Plautpresides over the ceremonial meal of wine, bitter herbs and honeyed haroset --with translation provided by Russian-speaking staff of Jewish Family Services-- Russian musicians will play and participants will kick up their heels intraditional dances.;    &quot;This Soviet seder on Sunday will be filled tooverflowing. Even when we ran out of tickets, people called and begged us tobe able to come. It's going to be wonderful,&quot; says Rachel Jarkov who, alongwith her husband, Michael, 9-year-old daughter, Dina, mother andmother-in-law, was in the first group of Soviet Jews to arrive in this areaafter Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev liberalized emigration laws.;   Jarkov, a former English teacher from Leningrad, arrived here a year and ahalf ago with her family. Now director of Jewish Family Services' emigreresettlement program, she is helping three generations of immigrants come togrips both with the American way of life and their religious roots.;    &quot;Ourparents' generation -- because of persecution and because of theanti-religious nature of Soviet society -- had to forget about their roots,&quot;Jarkov said. &quot;We all had a lot of learning to do.&quot;;    But the enrichmentprocess is a two-way street.;    &quot;We need to preserve our own culture aswell,&quot; she says.;    Jarkov already is publishing a Russian-language newspaperfor the emigre community and collecting books for a Russian library. Arts andmusic are priorities of the resettlement project.;    Coming to grips withAmerican life and their religious heritage while keeping touch with theirculture can be a tricky balancing act. But in the end, Jarkov says, it is anenriching experience.;    &quot;In Russia, most of us had no opportunity to learnabout their Jewish heritage,&quot; says Jarkov.;    &quot;Only now are my husband and Istudying Jewish history and culture. And after our daughter attended Jewishsummer camp this year, she started urging us to celebrate Shabbat. I'mstarting to understand what it really means to be Jewish.&quot;  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Mercury News Staff Report  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910330  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Saturday  </DAY><MONTH>  March  </MONTH><PG.COL>  9C  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  491  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Saturday March 30, 199100090071,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
