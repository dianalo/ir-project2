John S.R. Shad, who ordered the government's huge securitiesfraud investigation of Drexel in 1986, has been working out of anexecutive suite at the Wall Street firm for several weeks, Drexelspokesman Steven Anreder said.   Drexel, seeking to repair its image after agreeing to a record$650 million settlement with the government for a range of criminalsecurities law violations, offered Shad the post in January.   The nation's fifth-largest investment firm currently isnegotiating with the SEC to settle separate civil charges thatinclude insider trading.   Shad, 65, resigned later in January as U.S. ambassador to theNetherlands, where he served from June 1987. He ran the SEC, thefederal agency that regulates the nation's securities markerts,from 1981 to 1987.   Anreder said Shad would not decide whether to accept the Drexelchairman's job permanently until after the SEC settlement iscompleted. The deal has been expected for months but negotiationsrecently deadlocked.   Anreder would not say whether Shad was waiting for the SEC talksto end to avoid a possible conflict of interest. The spokesman alsosaid he didn't know whether Shad was getting paid.   ``He has indicated all along he would wait until the SECsettlement is in place. He set that as one of his requirements,''he said.   If Shad accepts the job, it would mark an ironic twist in thelegal battle. He ordered the massive government probe of Drexel inlate 1986 after Drexel was implicated in widespread wrongdoing byformer speculator Ivan F. Boesky, who is now serving a three-yearjail term.   In addition, Drexel's chief executive officer, Frederick Josephwas once hired by Shad 20 years ago when Shad ran the now-defunctinvestment firm E.F. Hutton andamp; Co.   Shad was out of the office and unavailable for comment, asecretary answering his telephone said.   Anreder would not specify Shad's activities in the office, butsaid he was ``familiarizing himself with the firm, people, doingthe things one does in that process.''   ``He is not working for the firm,'' Anreder said. ``He's beenexamining the firm, getting to know it, doing his own kind ofanalysis.''</TEXT></DOC>
