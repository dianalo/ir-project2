Mr. Deng faces a choice: crack down on the students to satisfy conservatives, who argue the protests show the changes have gone too far, or move to satisfy student demands for greater freedom of expression and explain that the protests are an understandable part of the process.    Police have tightened security in Shanghai, China's largest city, after three days of protests by tens of thousands of students. Police warned that anyone demonstrating without permission would be arrested; a planned mass rally yesterday fizzled out.    The demonstrations are the largest since the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution. Even if authorities can end the street protests, political ripples from the students' strident calls for more democracy and press freedom will be felt for months.    Western diplomats in China and administration officials here say the protests almost certainly will increase tension within China's leadership as it prepares for next year's party congress. The meeting is expected to focus on controversial proposals to reduce the role of the party and state in economic management, in an effort to ensure that basic changes already achieved can't be reversed.    The protests will &quot;sharpen the struggle within the party over the direction to take,&quot; said Donald Zagoria, a sinologist at New York's Hunter College. &quot;This will be a strong argument for those who want to limit the reforms or reverse some of them. There was already serious doubt about how much further the reformists could push things, and this will certainly make their job more difficult.&quot;    &quot;The reformers (in the Chinese leadership) are still very much in control,&quot; said Mr. Zagoria. &quot;But this could be an argument that greater limits now have to be set. The conservatives will say this is what you get, this is 'spiritual pollution' in its most acute form.&quot;    An administration official said the protests began Dec. 5 in Hefei, capital of An Hui province. Students were seeking a more open nominating process for local party congress candidates. Protests spread to Wuhan, capital of neighboring Hubei province, and to the cities of Chongqing and Kunming and the special economic zone at Shenzhen, on the border with Hong Kong.    The larger, more visible Shanghai protests partly reflect student dismay that the government-controlled press hadn't reported the incidents, which were publicized by word of mouth, the administration official said.    Western experts don't know if the demonstrations will bolster Mr. Deng's people, who want change, or their opponents. Michael Oksenberg, President Carter's China expert on the National Security Council staff, said the reformers &quot;will welcome something like this that enables them to say to more-skeptical people that this is what the people want.&quot; He said opponents of change, however, would use the event to underline the danger of opening Chinese society.    &quot;The students have clearly used this opportunity to insert themselves into this unsettled debate with their own set of demands,&quot; Mr. Oksenberg said. &quot;No matter when in this century China has been embroiled in significant debates about its future, the public senses it and joins in,&quot; he said, noting that student protests are a long Chinese tradition.    The critical question, according to Mr. Oksenberg, is whether the students will return to their studies, thus strengthening the reformers by demonstrating public support for liberalization, or whether the protests have reached &quot;a volatile point where China's leaders will retreat from the reform, fearful that they may be confronting a movement they can't channel.&quot;    The time is crucial now as Peking embarks on what Chinese scholars call the &quot;second wave&quot; of reforms. The probable measures are thought to face opposition from Maoist ideologues, public-security personnel, central planners and parts of the military upset that the percentage of the national budget devoted to defense has diminished.    Western analysts believe the next wave of change will involve economic liberalization that would reduce the role of the party in managing factories and create new capital and labor markets previously unknown in Communist nations. Chinese officials have said political reform could also give more authority to the provinces and allow more political expression, though such freedoms would fall far short of Western-style democracy.    The protests come at a time of uncertainty about what will happen to the economic and political changes after Mr. Deng's death. He has come close to engineering a succession to younger allies, but if he dies before other octogenarian leaders, they may be able to moderate Deng's program or restructure succession plans.    The course of change also rests on whether the leadership considers the benefits to outweigh the costs. The standard of living is up, particularly for the large number of farmers, and access to foreign technology is growing. But China is also frustrated by a large trade deficit and its difficulties in exporting to the West. Corruption is growing, as are social inequalities.    The government's response to the generally peaceful demonstrations has been restrained. But Western analysts were disturbed by the official Xinhua press agency report that accused the students of beating 31 policemen during a sit-in at City Hall in an article that cited the students' &quot;illegal actions.&quot; Some suggested that this might foreshadow a tougher reaction to the Shanghai students, who displayed signs demanding &quot;law, not authoritarianism.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
