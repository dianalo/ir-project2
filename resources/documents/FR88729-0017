Introduction </ITAG>On July 23, 1987, the Commission adopted final rules governing the domesticoffer and sale of commodity futures and option contracts traded on or subjectto the rules of a foreign board of trade. 52 FR 28980 (August 5, 1987).These rules, which became effective on February 1, 1988, establish, amongother things, a regulatory framework for the offer and sale of foreignoption products to persons located in the United States. \1\<NOTE/> Specifically, Rule 30.3(a) provides that:<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ Rule 30.1(b) defines a foreign option as any transactionor agreement which is or is held out to be of the character of, or is commonlyknown to the trade as, an ``option'', ``privilege'', ``indemnity'', ``bid'',``offer'', ``put'', ``call'', ``advance guaranty'' or ``decline guaranty'',made or to be made on or subject to the rules of a foreign board of trade.<ITAG tagnum="21">[N]otwithstanding any other provisions of this part, it shall be unlawfulfor any person to engage in the offer and sale of any foreign option untilthe Commission, by order, authorizes such foreign option to be offeredin the United States * * *. 52 FR 28988.</ITAG>In this regard, in view of the history of abuses in the options marketsprior to the imposition of the options ban, \2\<NOTE/> the Commission determined to phase in foreign options ona market-by-market basis through particularized review of applicationssubmitted by individual markets and issuance of an authorization order,as appropriate, by the Commission. \3\<NOTE/> In adopting the final rules which implement that procedure,the Commission stated that notwithstanding the enactment of Part 30, whichprovides a regulatory framework to govern transactions in both foreignfutures <T3>and</T3> foreign options, and which has been the subject of extensivenotice and comment, it would be unlawful for any person to engage in theoffer and sale of a particular foreign option product until the Commissionspecifically authorizes such foreign option to be offered and sold in theUnited States. \4\<NOTE/> As a consequence, Rule 30.3(a) permits the Commission, asstated in the release accompanying the proposed rules, to consider, amongother things, its ability to determine whether or not a particular tradehas been transmitted to and executed on a foreign exchange in determiningwhether to authorize transactions in specific foreign exchange-traded options.\5\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ <T3>See</T3> 51 FR 12104, 12105 (April 8, 1986). The pattern of abusesthat was characteristic of option sales practices in the past, and whichcontributed to the Commission's decision to suspend all option sales in1978, included the unavailability of data necessary to permit a determinationwhether orders for options had in fact been executed or whether they simplyhad been ``bucketed''. <T3>See</T3> 43 FR 16155 (April 17, 1978). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ Although the statutory prohibition on the offer and saleof foreign options formerly contained in section 4c(c) of the CommodityExchange Act (``Act'') has been removed, <T3>see</T3> Futures Trading Act of 1986, Pub. L. 99-641, section 102,100 Stat. 3556 (1987), the regulatory prohibition in Commission Rule 32.11,17 CFR 32.11 (1987), adopted pursuant to section 4c(b) of the Act, remainsin effect. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ 52 FR 28980, 28998. Notwithstanding the prohibition inCommission Rule 30.3(a), non-domestic exchange-traded options which aretraded pursuant to the trade option exemption in Commission Rule 32.4(a),17 CFR 32.4(a) (1987), may continue to be offered and sold. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ 51 FR 12104, 12105. By separate letters dated September 3, 1987, the Singapore InternationalMonetary Exchange (``SIMEX'') and the regulatory authority which governsthat exchange, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (``MAS''), requestedthat the Commission authorize the offer and sale of option contracts tradedon SIMEX to persons located in the United States. By letter dated September29, 1987, the Commission advised that the request on behalf of SIMEX wouldbe addressed pursuant to Commission Rule 30.3(a). <ITAG tagnum="84">II. Recommendation </ITAG>The Division of Trading and Markets (``Division'') has carefully reviewedand considered the application of SIMEX to offer and sell option productstraded on SIMEX in the United States, in particular addressing: (1) Theavailability of certain information relevant to preventing abuses in thetrading of such contracts; (2) the arrangements in place for deterringsales practice abuses; (3) the ability of United States customers to redressgrievances with respect to the conduct of trading and other offshore activitiesrelevant to the offer and sale of SIMEX option products; and (4) the regulatoryenvironment in which such options are traded. As discussed more fully below,based upon its determinations with respect to the foregoing matters, andsubject to the terms and conditions specified herein, the Division recommendsthat the Commission publish in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> this memorandum and approve and publish the attachedorder permitting certain option contracts traded on SIMEX to be offeredand sold in the United States. \6\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\ <T3>See</T3> attached list of option contracts and terms and conditions.The Division believes that review of the individual foreign option contractsshould be limited at this time to the regulatory issues discussed aboveand should not include an analysis of whether these foreign option contractswould meet the Commission's economic purpose tests, 17 CFR 33.4(a)(5)(i)(1987), or other criteria relating to the specific terms and conditionsof the option contract. <T3>See</T3> 17 CFR 33.4. <ITAG tagnum="84">III. Discussion</ITAG>Information SharingPrior to the imposition of the options ban in 1978, the ability of theCommission to address problems which occurred with respect to the offerand sale of certain ostensibly foreign options in the United States wasimpeded by the inaccessibility of information from their purported jurisdictionof origin. As a consequence, in determining to lift the options ban withrespect to foreign products, the Commission indicated that a primary considerationwould be the availability of transaction information.\7\<NOTE/> In connection with the petition of SIMEX under Rule 30.3(a),MAS has advised the Commission in a letter dated December 21, 1987, andthe Commission in a letter to MAS dated January 14, 1988 has acknowledged,that MAS will share with the Commission, on an ``as needed'' basis, informationrelevant to SIMEX option transactions proposed to be entered into withor on behalf of United States customers pursuant to Rule 30.3(a). The foregoingexchange of correspondence confirms that the Commission's assessment ofneed will be determinative. The assurances of MAS concerning informationsharing on an as needed basis extend, but are not limited, to informationas to trade confirmations, offshore funds committed to SIMEX option transactions,firm-related fitness (such as standing to do business and financial condition),and the sales practices of firms selling from Singapore into the UnitedStates. MAS also has provided the Commission with further assurances thatthe secrecy provisions of the Singapore banking laws will not interferewith its sharing of information with the Commission concerning optionstrading activities. In addition, MAS and SIMEX \8\<NOTE/> have each represented that all statements that were madewith respect to information sharing in connection with the Commission'sconsideration of proposed rules submitted by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange(``CME'') to implement the CME-SIMEX linkage extend equally and withoutrestriction to transactions in options trade on SIMEX.\9\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\ 52 FR 28980, 28988.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\8\ <T3>See </T3>letter from Ang Swee Tian, General Manager, SIMEX, dated September3, 1987 and letter from Koh Beng Seng, Director, Banking and FinancialInstitutions Department, MAS, dated February 4, 1988.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\ In this regard, in connection with the Commission's considerationof the CME-SIMEX mutual offset system, MAS specifically had confirmed theCommission's understanding that:<ITAG tagnum="28">SIMEX will have the same powers for requiring the disclosure of positionsas does the CME and * * * the secrecy provisions of the Singapore BankingLaws will not apply in trading involving gold and financial futures onSIMEX. Necessary surveillance information will be readily available fromSIMEX to the [Commission] or MAS for purposes of intermarket supervisionto further the prevention of manipulation, fraud or in an enforcement proceeding.</ITAG><T3>See </T3>telex from MAS to Commission dated March 2, 1984 conformingCommission telex to MAS dated February 17, 1984.Sales Practice AuditsIn developing its pilot program for domestic exchange-traded options, theCommission specifically required as a condition of designation that thecontract market seeking approval of an option adequately provide for themonitoring and detection of sales practice abuses.\10\<NOTE/> As such abuses ultimately contributed to the banning of optionstrading altogether in 1978, the Commission has indicated that any optionsoffered in the United States must be subject to an adequate sales practiceaudit program.\11\<NOTE/> In this connection, SIMEX represents that it has adoptedrules, discussed more fully below, regarding option sales practices including,but not limited to, customer complaints, supervision of employees and accounts,solicitation, notification of disciplinary actions, risk disclosure, discretionaryaccounts and promotional material, which are virtually identical to rulesof the CME with respect to the same subjects.\12\<NOTE/> Additionally, MAS represents that will ensure that salespractice audits of firms in Singapore selling SIMEX options into the UnitedStates will be conducted on a regular basis.\13\<NOTE/> SIMEX also has made arrangements with the National FuturesAssociation (``NFA''), which NFA has confirmed by letter dated June 10,1988, to assure that the sales practices of firms located in the UnitedStates engaged in such activities will be audited.\14\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\10\ <T3>See </T3>46 FR 54500, 54502 (November 3, 1981).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\11\ <T3>Id.</T3><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\12\ <T3>See </T3>SIMEX rules AA02-AA06 and AA08 discussed, <T3>infra.</T3><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\13\ <T3>See </T3>letter from MAS dated February 4, 1988.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\14\ On January 14, 1988, the Commission approved amendmentsto NFA's Bylaws and the adoption of new Bylaws to provide for the regulationof the foreign futures and option activities of NFA members and associates.By letter dated June 10, 1988 from Daniel A. Driscoll, Vice-President ofthe NFA, to Andrea M. Corcoran, Director, Division of Trading and Markets,the NFA confirmed that the NFA and U.S. exchanges which are a party toa joint sales practice audit agreement will provide sales practice auditservices addressing sales of SIMEX options.Dispute ResolutionIn considering linkage arrangements intended in part to foster tradingamong domestic and foreign markets, the Commission has indicated that amaterial factor in its decision to approve such arrangements was the existenceof a mechanism to permit United States customers to seek relief for disputesoccurring in the linked jurisdiction.\15\<NOTE/> The availability of a forum to address complaints with respectto trade execution also is relevant to any determination to lift the banon foreign option products. This is because the provision of such a forumevidences the relevant foreign jurisdiction's intention to afford practicalmechanisms to address complaints originating with customers not locatedin that jurisdiction and to assure a fair trading environment. In thisconnection, in its March 2, 1984 telex to the Commission in connectionwith the mutual offset system, MAS confirmed that:<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\15\ <T3>See </T3>staff memorandum (``Staff Memorandum'') dated August 28, 1984,analyzing CME-SIMEX linkage at p. 51; <T3>see also </T3>staff memorandum dated August 1, 1986, analyzing theCommodity Exchange, Inc._Sydney Futures Exchange linkage at p. 22.<ITAG tagnum="21">SIMEX will establish an arbitration system similar to that of theCME which will be available to U.S. citizens for resolution of disputesand further that U.S. citizens have access to the Singapore judicial systemfor actions involving Singaporeans, just as citizens of other nations mayuse U.S. courts in actions against U.S. citizens.</ITAG>In December 1984, the Board of Directors of SIMEX approved rules whichestablished an arbitration system for the resolution of disputes involvingtransactions on SIMEX or pursuant to the mutual offset system with CME.Pursuant to these rules, SIMEX maintains a forum for resolution of disputesarising out of transactions conducted on SIMEX, including the mutual offsetsystem with CME.\16\<NOTE/> All claims not exceedings $15,000 (approximately US$7,500),submitted no more than one year since the party making the claim knew orshould have known of the act or transaction that is the subject of thedispute, are arbitrable under these rules. MAS has confirmed in its letterof December 21, 1987, that although all parties have the right to be presentwhen the arbitration board appointed pursuant to SIMEX rules hears a case,such presence is not mandatory. Under the rules, the arbitration boardmust consider all written documents submitted under oath or affirmationin resolving disputes committed to arbitration. Thus, a foreign futuresand option customer may arbitrate a claim using documentary evidence only.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\16\ <T3>See </T3>Chapter 6, SIMEX Rules, and ``Your Right to Arbitration,''a SIMEX publication.Regulatory Environment When options were originally banned in the United States, they had notbeen subjected to a full regulatory program. It is appropriate, therefore,to inquire as to whether the market which proposes to offer option productsin the United States has a regulatory structure which addresses marketintegrity and the sales practices of firms doing business with United Statesfirms or customers.\17\<NOTE/> This review is for the purpose of establishing the existenceof a supervised marketplace and does not constitute a comparability analysisof the nature required under Rule 30.10 for certain other relief the Commissionmay accord under its foreign futures and option rules.\18\<NOTE/> This review was facilitated by the detailed scrutiny givenSIMEX during the Commission's consideration of the rules submitted by theCME to implement the mutual offset system linkage agreement between theCME and SIMEX.\19\<NOTE/> In reviewing that application, the Commission's staff analyzed,among other things, the customer protection, market surveillance and tradepractice surveillance rules of the Exchange. The Staff Memorandum \20\<NOTE/> concluded that the systems and rules adopted by SIMEX, ifobserved, afforded many of the protections found on regulated United Statesmarkets. Rule enforcement reviews conducted to date of the CME have reportedno significant deficiencies in the operation of the CME-SIMEX linkage.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\17\ Although the Commission has not indicated an intentionto review the terms and conditions of foreign option products, <T3>see </T3>S. Rep. No. 384, 97th Cong., 2d Sess. 45-46 (1982), the Commission'sauthority with respect to options is plenary. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\18\ 52 FR 28980, 29001. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\19\ In generally excluding transactions executed pursuantto a linkage agreement between one or more foreign boards of trade anda United States contract market from the application of the foreign futuresand option rules, the Commission noted that linked transactions and theregulatory environment in which such transactions occur would be separatelysubject to Commission review under section 5a(12) of the Act. Specifically,Rule 30.3(a) reads, in part, as follows: <ITAG tagnum="28">* * * </ITAG><T3>And, provided further, </T3>That, with the exception of the disclosureand antifraud provisions set forth in andSection;andSection; 30.6 and 30.9of this part, the provisions of this part shall not apply to transactionsexecuted on a foreign board of trade, and carried for or on behalf of acustomer at a designated contract market, subject to an agreement withor rules of a contract market which permit positions in a commodity interestwhich have been established in one market to be liquidated on another market.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\20\ Staff Memorandum at p. 67. Subsequent to the Commission's approval of the CME-SIMEX mutual offsetsystem, Singapore adopted the Singapore Futures Trading Act of 1986 andRegulations thereunder, copies of which have been provided to the Commission.The MAS and SIMEX represent that the Singapore Futures Trading Act andthe Regulations promulgated thereunder establish a regulatory environmentwhich parallels that established under the Commodity Exchange Act and Commissionrules in terms of the subjects addressed, the content of the statutoryand regulatory provisions and the provisions for effecting compliance therewith.Specifically, in support of the SIMEX application to sell its option productswithin the United States, MAS and SIMEX represent that the Singapore FuturesTrading Act of 1986 and the Regulations thereunder are intended to promotemarket integrity and to provide a fair trading environment for Singaporefutures and option products, as follows: <ITAG tagnum="81">a. Authorization of Exchanges (Fitness of the Marketplace) </ITAG>Section 4 of the Singapore Futures Trading Act vests sole authority forthe establishment of exchanges in a governmental body, the Monetary Authorityof Singapore. Before MAS may designate an entity as a futures exchange,it must be satisfied that, among other things, the futures exchange hasbusiness rules to ensure that: (1) Standards for membership, includingprocedures for the expulsion, suspension or discipline of members for conductinconsistent with just and equitable principles in connection with thetransaction of business are maintained; (2) obligations arising out offutures contracts entered into on that exchange will be honored; (3) floortrading practices are fair and properly supervised; (4) adequate measureshave been taken to prevent manipulation and excessive speculation; (5)adequate provision has been made to record and publish details of trading;(6) a compensation fund or other system acceptable to MAS has been establishedto compensate customers who suffer loss as a result of theft by personsentrusted with customer funds; and (7) generally the exchange is capableof carrying on business with due regard to the interests and protectionof the public. These rules establish trading standards and also requirethe maintenance of trading records essential to effective information sharingwith respect to option transactions. <ITAG tagnum="81">b. Licensing of Firms And Personnel (Fitness Standards For Professionals)</ITAG>Sections 10-24 of the Singapore Futures Trading Act establish licensingstandards for futures brokers, trading advisers, pool operators and theirrepresentatives. The licensing procedure for persons dealing with the publicis set forth in the Second Schedule of the Regulations promulgated pursuantto the Singapore Futures Trading Act. For example, Form 3, Applicationfor Futures Broker's License, requires, <T3>inter alia, </T3>the disclosure of controlling interests in the broker,a detailed description of its organization, prior licenses or revocationsof licenses, convictions, bankruptcies and previous employment historyof principals for the past 5 years. Under sections 14 and 15 of the SingaporeFutures Trading Act, MAS has the authority either to refuse to grant orrenew a license under certain conditions, including the failure to discloseinformation, a previous bankruptcy or conviction of offenses involvingfraud or dishonesty, or to grant or renew a license subject to conditions.These rules are intended to establish a standard of fitness for marketprofessionals who handle customer money and deal with the public. <ITAG tagnum="81">c. Financial Requirements (Fitness Standards For Firms) </ITAG>Regulation 12 sets forth minimum financial requirements for futures brokers.In essence, Regulation 12(1) requires that an amount equal to the higherof S$250,000 (US$122,500) or 10% of mandatory segregated customer fundsbe maintained at all times.\21\<NOTE/> (Segregated funds include money, securities or property receivedby a futures broker to margin, guarantee or secure contracts in futurestrading or accruing to a customer as a result of such trading.) In addition,Regulation 12(2) requires futures brokers to file quarterly financial reports,including statements of financial condition, computation of adjusted netcapital and segregation requirements and location of segregated funds.<T3>See </T3>Forms 21, 22 and 23 in the Second Schedule of the Regulations.These rules establish a standard of financial fitness which is relevantto the expectation that members will comply with applicable rules and thecapacity of members to meet their obligations in the marketplace. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\21\ Conversions at June 21, 1988 as published in the <T3>Washington Post, </T3>June 22, 1988.<ITAG tagnum="81">d. Treatment of Customer Funds And Property </ITAG>Section 37 of the Singapore Futures Trading Act defines customer fundsas all money, securities or property received by a futures broker to margin,guarantee or secure contracts in futures trading, or accruing to a customeras a result of such trading. That section of the Act and Regulation 15thereunder require a futures broker to treat and deal with customer fundsas belonging to that customer and prohibit commingling of customer fundswith the broker's own funds.\22\<NOTE/> Under section 25 of the Act and Regulation 15(1), each futuresbroker is required to keep books and records which accurately discloseall customer transactions and trace the flow of funds. In addition, Regulation15(3)(1) restricts the investment of customer funds to Singapore Governmentsecurities, any debt instruments of the government of the country in whichthe market or futures exchange where the futures broker normally transactsits business is situated, and any securities or instruments as MAS fromtime to time may prescribe. Certified audits of accounts are mandated bysection 27 of the Singapore Futures Trading Act for futures brokers. Anauditor for a futures broker is required under section 28 to notify MASif at any time the auditor becomes aware of any adverse financial matter.These rules provide certain protections for customer funds committed totrading on SIMEX. These rules may also assist in tracing funds offshorethat are the subject of actions in the United States. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\22\ Although margin is not required for purchased put orcall options, the full premium must be paid in cash. SIMEX does maintainmargin requirements on short option positions. <T3>See </T3>SIMEX rule AA07 and terms and conditions of options on foreigncurrency futures traded on SIMEX, attached. <ITAG tagnum="81">e. Market Integrity </ITAG>Section 42 of the Singapore Futures Trading Act authorizes MAS or an exchange,with the approval of MAS, to establish position and trading limits to diminishor prevent excessive speculation. Regulation 16 provides that the positionlimits for ``futures contracts'' \23\<NOTE/> listed on SIMEX shall be the quantity determined by SIMEXand approved by MAS. In addition, SIMEX maintains a large trader reportingsystem similar to that maintained by the Commission.\24\<NOTE/> Sections 50-57 of the Singapore Futures Trading Act prohibitoffenses such as false trading, bucketing, manipulation and fraudulentor deceptive devices, and provide for penalties of up to a S$100,000 (US$49,000)fine and seven years imprisonment. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\23\ The term ``futures contract'' is defined under section2 of the Singapore Futures Trading Act to include commodity options. SIMEXRule 532 authorizes SIMEX to establish position limits on options. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\24\ <T3>See </T3>Agreement for the Creation of a Mutual Offset System betweenthe Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the Singapore International MonetaryExchange Limited, June 28, 1984, p. 22. <ITAG tagnum="81">f. Other Customer Protections </ITAG>Section 39 of the Singapore Futures Trading Act requires customers to beprovided with a risk disclosure statement in a form mandated by MAS. Regulations17 and 18 require futures brokers to provide confirmation statements andmonthly account statements to their customers. Regulations 19, 20 and 21establish business conduct standards for firms which include performancedisclosure and disclosure of conflicts of interest where appropriate. <ITAG tagnum="81">g. SIMEX Option Rules </ITAG>SIMEX has submitted its option rules \25\<NOTE/> which it represents are virtually identical to the rulesof the CME. These rules contemplate that SIMEX takes responsibility forensuring sales practice compliance by its members, maintains fair requirementsfor executions, and monitors the financial soundness of its members. SIMEXrepresents that it maintains in effect and enforces rules which:<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\25\ In his February 4, 1988 letter to the Commission, KohBeng Seng, Director, Banking and Financial Institutions Department, MAS,represented that SIMEX rules relating to option contracts on Eurodollarfutures came into force on September 25, 1987, while those relating tooption contracts on the Deutschemark and Yen futures contracts became effectiveon November 27, 1987.
