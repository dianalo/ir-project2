Whether anyone is wiseris harder to answer.   Two reporters covering the story, David Greising ofBusinessWeek and Laurie Morse of the Knight-Ridder FinancialNews wire service, offer up what Publishers Weekly calls a&quot;jarring expose&quot; on the subject in &quot;Brokers, Bagmen andamp; Moles(John Wiley andamp; Sons, 337 pages, $24.95). The book actuallyisn't very jarring -- after all, we're talking about futurestraders here, not choirboys. Nor is there much covered thatwasn't reported at the time.   Indeed, the seedy side of pit culture in the '80s -- thedrugs, women and various toys so many men making so muchmoney spent their leisure hours pursuing -- all thisessential context is mostly missing from the book. That said,the authors do mention an executive's concubine on the staffof the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. And at times thenarrative does rise to the level of expose as tradersmasquerading as linchpins of capitalism are caught with theirhands in the public till.   The futures industry hasn't been held in terribly highregard since its founding in Chicago nearly acentury-and-a-half ago. Traders, who say they serve alegitimate risk-shifting function, have been denounced byChicago's high-minded hog butchers and other mercantile elitethrough the years as gamblers, manipulators and sundryepithets that can't be printed in a family newspaper.   Indeed, Dwayne Andreas, chairman of the giant grainprocessor Archer-Daniels-Midland Co., who thought his firmhad been unjustly fined by the Chicago Board of Trade, madethe sting possible by agreeing to have Archer Daniels trainand sponsor some of the FBI &quot;moles.&quot; The fact that Mr.Andreas is a major contributor to Republican Party causes mayhave helped focus the Justice Department's attention on thepits.   When the story broke in the Chicago Tribune in January of1989, the question in many people's minds wasn't whether anytraders would be found to have stolen money from customers,but how many, and how far up the futures-trading food chaincould the fraud be traced?   The FBI agent-traders proved fairly adept at gatheringincriminating evidence against unsuspecting traders whoperched near them in the stair-stepped trading pits. Themopes, some poor, some nouveau riche, who were caughtstealing profits claimed they were doing what everybody elsewas doing to get by in the volatile markets. Local tradersrisking their own money would change prices on a trade to&quot;eat&quot; losses for brokers handling customer orders. Thebrokers would pay the locals back the next time with a profitthat should have gone into a customer's account.   Early in the investigation, prosecutors believed at leastsome exchange officials could be implicated in wrongdoing.The Justice Department successfully kept exchange officers inthe dark about the investigation going on under their noses,even though each exchange functions as a federally sanctionedself-regulatory organization.   With the big-name traders having escaped unstung, and theinvestigation having fizzled, the government can still pointto tougher rules implemented by exchanges in the wake of theinvestigation, as well as to the push for more automatedfutures trading, as examples of the positive changes it haswrought.   But was all of this necessary to begin cleaning up thepits? Many defense attorneys, who are former prosecutors withno illusions about the amount of corruption that existed inthe pits, argue that the government's use of racketeeringcharges against many indicted traders hobbled the probe.Lesser fraud charges would have induced more traders tocooperate, and might have led to bigger fish being caught inthe government's net, they say.   Juries also had trouble swallowing the argument that manyof the traders were racketeers. Their failures to reachverdicts on many of these and other counts allowed exchangeofficials to claim that, sure, they had some rotten apples,but the government's case was overstated from the start.   In the end, Chicago's honest futures traders -- yes, thereare many of them -- are as much to blame as anyone for thesting operation. For years most of them accepted thecorruption as a cost of doing business. What can one man do?I've got a business to run, they would shrug when confrontedon the subject. The black eye given the futures industry bythe federal probe is a self-inflicted wound.   ---   Mr. McMurray is a reporter in the Journal's Chicagobureau.</TEXT></DOC>
