Bennett threatening his political future.   ``The allegations are absolutely ridiculous,'' said WayneLaPierre, executive director of NRA's Institute for LegislativeAction.   An administration source said Friday that the warnings to Bennettthrough third parties threaten that ``if he has thoughts of apolitical future, he can forget them if he doesn't respect the powerof the NRA.''   Bennett has frequently been mentioned as a candidate for electedoffice.   The source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Bennett is``very angry at the NRA'' and that while he's ``not looking for afight with the NRA, he won't walk away from it'' and may battle themin public if need be.   Bennett said Friday through spokesman Don Hamilton: ``There havebeen a lot of phone calls, a lot of pressure. Let's cool off.''   The issue arose Tuesday when, at Bennett's urging, TreasurySecretary Nicholas Brady immediately suspended import permits formore than 110,000 assault-style rifles such as the semiautomaticversions of AK-47s and Uzi carbines. Colt Industries Incsubsequently decided on its own to suspend sales of its AR-15, themost popular U.S.-made semiautomatic assault rifle.   President Bush had told Bennett a week earlier to develop apolicy on the rifles. Calls for a ban have been prompted by scoresof drug-related shootings and the recent killing of five Californiaschoolchildren by a man wielding such a weapon.   Publicly, the NRA has reacted calmly to the decision, saying itwould relieve the ``media hysteria'' over the guns and ``shouldprovide an atmosphere for a reasoned and sensible debate on thisissue.''   But privately, the source alleged, the NRA has been relayingwarnings via ``private people'' who are not in government.   During an interview earlier in the day, Bennett said he believedmost members of the NRA do not support an ``anything goes'' attitudetoward gun ownership and said he had spoken with friends of his whoare hunters. ``These people have no use or interest in assaultrifles,'' he said.   ``The `anything goes' idea _ let's just get our hands on any kindof weapon _ I think that's a view of the world that's not shared bymost Americans, by most members of the National Rifle Association,and I think an awful lot of people out there are concerned about thekind of firepower that we're seeing used in our streets,'' he said.   Bennett said he was not surprised that sales of semiautomaticassault rifles have taken off since the import suspension and Colt'saction this week, but, he said: ``If people are doing this becausethey think that this could mean the end of guns, that no more gunswould be available, then they're mistaken.   ``The tradition in this country of a law-abiding citizen havingguns, using them for lawful purposes, teaching their kids how tohunt, target shooting, is as old as this republic itself, and it'snot something anybody wants to disturb.''   Echoing the NRA's words, Bennett said: ``Everybody knowsultimately the problem isn't the gun, the problem is the gun in thewrong hands.   ``But it seems to me reasonable measures can be found and takenin this effort which don't deprive or interfere with that good anddecent practice of people enjoying their firearms in lawful ways andyet respond and speak appropriately to this escalation, this armsrace in the cities that police have spoken about so eloquently.Clearly there's a large middle ground there.''</TEXT></DOC>
