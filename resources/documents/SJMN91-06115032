More recently,nutritionists have been advising us to eat more fiber. So, it isn't surprisingthat we have a glut of new breakfast cereals on the market designed to satisfyboth. So many in fact that I'm thinking of starting a Cereal-of-the-MonthClub.;    General Mills Basic 4 is so named because it provides each of thefour basic food groups (you supply the dairy part with milk, nuts supply the&quot;meat&quot; or protein). Unfortunately, it also provides you with a lot more sugarthan you need, which is my biggest complaint about many of these newfangledcereals. If you're going to be that sweet, give me Sugar Smacks, for Pete'ssake.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Food  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  NO END IN SIGHT TO PARADE OF CEREALS  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Tasting Notes  </MEMO><TEXT>     Aside from the sugar, Basic 4 has added what amounts to a trail mix toflakes. You've got cranberries, raisins, prunes, walnuts, almonds and driedapples (what, no papaya?). That's too much for me. My favorite cereals arestill the simple ones, Grape Nuts and Shredded Wheat.;    A 14.5-ounce box ofBasic 4 costs about $3.40.;    Triples is a more austere cereal from GeneralMills, just corn, rice and wheat. (And of course some color, flavor andinjected vitamins. God forbid, we should get all we need from the cerealalone.) Triples looks as if it is the result of a union of Trix and puffedrice. It's light and fluffy, but a little too light for me. I like a bit moresubstance in breakfast cereals. On the plus side, it's not nearly as sweet asBasic 4. And it comes in a nice teal box (the color of the '90s?). A13.25-ounce box costs about $2.49.; (hbox);    A little morning coffee withyour cereal? Perfect Balance, according to manufacturer Hills Bros., is thefirst nationally distributed coffee with all the flavor and aroma of regularcoffee and only one-half the caffeine.;    The good news is that the company'sclaim is essentially correct. The bad news is that most &quot;nationallydistributed&quot; coffees such as Hills Bros., Folgers, et al., don't have muchflavor to begin with. So, if you like those coffees and only want a mild joltof caffeine, by all means try Perfect Balance. Personally, I still plan to buyfresh-roasted beans. Perfect Balance is available in 12-ounce ($2.29),24-ounce ($3.89) and 36-ounce ($5.99) cans. An instant version comes in7-ounce jars for about $3.59.; (hbox);    Here's a tip to keep your freshginger tasty and free of mold. After the ginger has been cut, wrap it in apaper towel, then put it in a plastic bag. Change the paper towel every fewdays.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Sam Gugino column  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910424  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Wednesday  </DAY><MONTH>  April  </MONTH><PG.COL>  2E  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  452  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Wednesday April 24, 199100115032,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
