Some examples may be enlightening.    Although John Rutledge had served as a justice, his nomination by George Washington in 1795 met immediate ideological opposition, centering on Rutledge's known dislike of Jay's Treaty, the final peace treaty with Great Britain. Despite his acknowledged qualifications, the Senate rejected him on purely ideological grounds.    In the last moments of the John Quincy Adams administration, the president sought to place Kentucky's Sen. Crittenden, an ardent Whig, on the court. The Senate refused to act, purely on political grounds, until Andrew Jackson's inauguration, thereby giving Jackson the opportunity to nominate fellow Democrat John McLean.    In 1845, President Polk sought to place a well-respected Pennsylvania judge, George Woodward, on the court. Even though Polk's Democrats controlled the Senate, Woodward was rejected because his American Nativist views were regarded as too extreme.    On the eve of the Civil War, President Buchanan nominated his attorney general, Jeremiah Black, a former chief justice of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court. The Senate rejected him because his pro-slavery views were ideologically unacceptable.    Two of President Grant's nominees were rejected by the Republican-controlled Senate on grounds that the nominees were insufficiently radical on questions of Reconstruction politics.    When the Senate rejected President Hoover's nomination of John Parker, Sen. Borah, who led the opposition, made it perfectly clear that the opposition was purely ideological; Judge Parker was deemed unfit to serve on the Supreme Court not &quot;because of his lack of learning, or because of his incapability as a lawyer, for in no sense was he lacking in fitness . . .&quot; but because &quot;his views on certain important questions were unsound.&quot;    The nation's history profoundly and demonstrably contradicts your contention that &quot;the Senate's advice-and-consent powers are not a license to substitute its tastes for the president's.&quot; In fact, it is just that. Indeed, for a senator to ignore his own political philosophy in weighing a court nomination is to betray the trust invested in him by the electorate that sent him to the Senate, presumably on the strength of that political philosophy.    Judge Bork, or whomever President Reagan proposes, may be extremely well-qualified to sit on the court. But if the Senate prefers a nominee it perceives as less &quot;conservative&quot; it has every right, and indeed an obligation, to so insist.    Prof. Calvin R.
