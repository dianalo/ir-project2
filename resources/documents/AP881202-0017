Salinas, promising political and economic reforms, said Thursdayin his inaugural speech to Congress that ``my administration willrespond to the citizens' demand for respect for (political)plurality and effective participation.''   Salinas' July 6 presidential victory, the narrowest in the59-year history of the governing Institutional Revolutionary Party,or PRI, has been clouded by allegations the election was fraughtwith fraud and vote-tampering.   Defying heavy deployment of army troops, police and plainclothessecurity guards, thousands who claim the PRI deprived CuauhtemocCardenas of victory in the election held scattered demonstrations.Unlike previous demonstrations, many protesters carried sharpenedsticks.   Police used tear gas to break up a demonstration by 1,500 peoplein Zocalo Plaza outside the National Palace, where Salinas wentafter the inauguration. About 150 people, including some police andsoldiers, were injured but none were hospitalized, Red Crossparamedic Carlos Daniel Ramirez said.   As Salinas spoke, a crowd of several thousand threw rocks atpolice outside the Legislative Palace. Several demonstrators andpolicemen were reported injured.   One police department employee said there were ``many'' arrests,but police spokesmen refused to give figures.   A crowd of 6,000 marched about 1{ miles cheering Cardenas, whodefeated Salinas in populous Mexico City but finished secondnationally to the president.   According to the official tally, Salinas won just over 50 percentof the vote, with Cardenas getting 31 percent, and Manuel Clouthierof the conservative National Action Party a distant third with 17percent.   ``It falls to us to create the conditions so that this government... leaves the National Palace and that it is occupied by thepeople,'' Cardenas told the crowd.   Cardenas supporters occupied at least 19 city halls in his homestate of Michoacan last week to demand the ouster of the Michoacangovernor and staged protests outside 20 others.   Protesters outside the Legislative Palace said police removed 200to 300 people early Thursday and left them outside city limits.Alberta Torres Sanchez, 75, claimed police put her on a bus toPuebla, 65 miles southeast of the capital. She said she took anotherbus back to rejoin demonstrators.   Just before Salinas, 40, was sworn in, about 140 congressmen fromthe four parties making up Cardenas' National Democratic Frontwalked out.   ``Only the vote can legitimize him!'' shouted one congressman asthe group filed out.   The congressional delegation of the conservative National ActionParty, which has not recognized Salinas' victory but says he canredeem himself by performing well in office, remained through thespeech.   At the end of his speech, however, the delegation of 40 raisedsigns telling Salinas to ``show with actions your pledge todemocracy.''   Under an agreement with the PRI, leaders of the two oppositionblocs were allowed to make televised pre-inaugural speeches criticalof Salinas' election in return for a promise not to interrupt theceremony.   ``I take office in a complex hour: between collective hope andthe weight of accumulated sacrifices; between the need for buildingfor the future and the pressure for immediate accomplishments,''Salinas said. ``It is a singular moment in our history, heavy withrisks but rich in opportunity.''   Six years of austerity under a program Salinas designed as budgetsecretary under Miguel de la Madrid cut workers' buying power bymore than half. It combined with years of slowly mounting discontentwith government corruption and elections where the result was aforegone conclusion _ victory for the PRI.   To recover the economic initiative, Salinas said he had givenorders to Treasury Secretary Pedro Aspe to begin negotiating newterms with international banks on its $102 billion foreign debt,second highest in the developing world behind Brazil.   U.S. Secretary of State George P. Shultz, who represented theUnited States, applauded Salinas' address.   ``Here was a man who loved his country with a passion and has aclear understanding of the opportunities and the problems ahead andis ready to roll up his sleeves and go to work,'' Shultz said aftermeeting with Salinas.</TEXT></DOC>
