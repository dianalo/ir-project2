INDONESIA BANS SOME BOOKS                                                                                                          Jakarta banned six books on religion, asserting theycontain false teachings that could cause unrest, though itdidn't elaborate. &quot;Paintings in Islam&quot; by Sir Thomas W.Arnold is among those banned because it is &quot;offensive toMuslims&quot; by depicting the Prophet Mohammed, an official said.Islam prohibits any visual image of Mohammed. About 88% ofIndonesia's 179 million people are Muslim.

After theAfrican National Congress was unbanned a year ago, the UDF, acoalition of organizations, willingly stepped aside as theANC reassumed political prominence. &quot;The unbanning of theANC, SACP (South African Communist Party) and other politicalformations last year, generated a process of self-evaluationand debates about the relevance of the UDF in our present daypolitical landscape,&quot; Titus Mafolo, a member of the executivecommittee, told about 400 delegates at a meeting.                                                                                                          VAMPIRE BATS IN PERU DEADLY                                                                                                          Rabies spread by vampire bats has caused at least sixdeaths in an Amazon jungle region of Peru near Ecuador. Theoutbreak was detected Feb. 11 in Yutupis, 500 miles north ofLima, where inhabitants are mainly members of theAguaruna-Huambisa Indian tribe. The government sent vaccineand medicine, and controlled the outbreak. Peru also isstruggling with a cholera epidemic that has left more than190 people dead.                                                                                                          FRANCE DETECTS A `MAD COW'                                                                                                          France reported its first case of &quot;mad cow&quot; disease,raising fears that the malady that devastated British herdshad crossed the English Channel. The disease, which destroysthe brains and central nervous systems of cattle, led totemporary bans last year in several European countries onimports of British beef.   In Saint Brieuc, in western France, veterinarypathologists found bovine spongiform encephalopathy in adairy cow that died Jan. 16 after exhibiting the classicsymptoms: hyperexcitability coupled with loss ofcoordination. The disease killed more than 16,000 cows bymid-1990 in Britain, which hasn't reported any cases thisyear, and the U.K. has declared beef safe to eat. TheEuropean Community in June restricted British beef exports tocontain the disease.   Scientists believe the disease was transmitted to cattlein Britain through feed containing meat of sheep infectedwith scrapie, and spread when sheep bones were ground intocattle feed as a protein supplement. After a panic inBritain, beef sales plunged 30%, despite governmentassurances that humans weren't known to be affected by themalady.   In France, the incident is viewed as an isolated case. The&quot;mad&quot; cow had an English ancestor, but scientists believe thedisease isn't transmitted genetically.
