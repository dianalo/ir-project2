Southland declined to comment on the Goldman Sachs statement.    As previously reported, Thompson Co., controlled by top executives of Southland and sons of the company's founder, has proposed acquiring the convenience-store retailer in a $4 billion leveraged buy-out.    However, Goldman Sachs, Southland's investment banker, has had difficulty selling the debt because of recent stock market volatility. A special shareholders meeting to approve the deal was postponed last week until this Thursday as a result of the difficulty.    The company had hoped to sell $650 million of pay-in-kind junior subordinated debentures maturing in 2007. Now, it will sell $325 million in debentures and $325 million in junior subordinated debentures that are zero-coupon for five years and then pay interest semiannually, Goldman Sachs said.    The rest of the transaction, which remains the same, involves $350 million of 10-year senior subordinated notes and $500 million of 15-year subordinated debentures.    Goldman Sachs said it is targeting pricing of the deal for tomorrow.    In a leveraged buy-out, a small group of investors acquires a company in a transaction financed largely by borrowing. Ultimately, the debt is paid with funds generated by the acquired company's operations or sale of its assets. </TEXT></DOC>
