The Dallas-based roof-maintenance consultant has justpublished the second issue of AntiShyster, a tabloid-sizednewspaper devoted to berating the legal profession. &quot;Ourlegal system has become an extortion racket,&quot; says Mr. Adask.&quot;Justice is contrary to the financial interest of everyattorney in the country.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   AntiShyster is packed with emotional articles detailinghow lawyers and the organized bar are taking advantage of thepublic. In the first issue, Mr. Adask argued that the averagelawyer costs the gross national product $1 million a year.   An article on the Texas debate over whether to discontinuethe state's self-regulating bar ended with the diatribe:&quot;Yuck it up shysters. Keep smilin'. Just keep on billin' anddouble-billin'. . . . Let nothing moral or decent or juststand in the way of your lust for money and power.&quot;   Mr. Adask's passion has bitter roots -- his unsuccessfulcustody fight seven years ago for his two children. &quot;I gotrailroaded as far as I'm concerned, and I became a student ofthe legal system,&quot; Mr. Adask says. Last year, he ran in theRepublican primary for the state Legislature on ananti-lawyer platform. He argued that lawyers, as officers ofthe court, do not belong in the legislature because theirpresence there violates the constitutionally mandatedseparation of powers. &quot;I got my butt kicked,&quot; he says.   Mr. Adask seems to be having better luck with AntiShyster.All 4,000 copies of AntiShyster, distributed free, weregobbled up; and he has been flooded with phone calls, somefrom readers who just wanted to thank him. Dallas-basedValley News Bookstore has agreed to distribute thepublication and has installed an 800 number to handle callsfrom all over the country. And Dallas Morning News columnistSteve Blow, who devoted a column to AntiShyster, received somany calls that he later published Mr. Adask's address.   But James Parsons, the Texas state bar president referredto as &quot;Jimbo&quot; in AntiShyster, calls Mr. Adask &quot;just one ofthose people who doesn't like lawyers. . . . I think he'sjust a fringe person who's just representing a fringeposition in a strident manner without effect.&quot;   But that criticism doesn't damp Mr. Adask's ardor for hiscause. &quot;Every so often the lunatic fringe turns into thecutting edge,&quot; he says. &quot;You never can tell.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
