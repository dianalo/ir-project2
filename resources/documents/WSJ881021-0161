The Russian version of AutoCAD is the first personal computer software to be sold by a Western software company in the Soviet Union. The company also plans to sell Polish and Czech language versions in Eastern Europe. Until recently, the U.S. government has strictly controlled the export of personal computers and related technology to Eastern European countries because the U.S. feared it would aid those countries' militaries. In August, another U.S. software company, Micropro International Corp. of San Rafael, Calif., signed an agreement with the Soviets to co-develop Russian language word-processing software.    Autodesk said 18 other companies will be showing AutoCAD-related products at the show, which is being held at the headquarters of the Moskvitch state-owned automobile manufacturing company. The exhibition closes today. </TEXT></DOC>
