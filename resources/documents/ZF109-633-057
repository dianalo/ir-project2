 OCR,which might have gone under Application Software, appears here because someof the OCR systems include hardware as well as software.andM;We also have included some color items here that didn't make it into our lastissue, which featured developments in color.andP;  Among the companies includedhere are Astral Development, Electronic Arts and Slidetek, which offer colorsoftware and systems; General Parametrics and Computer Support, with coloroutput products; KYE and Umax, both supplying handheld color scanners; andNational Digital, marketer of a non-JPEG data compression scheme.andM;Optical Character RecognitionandM;The OCR vendors focused mainly on ease-of-use enhancements rather than on newfeatures.andP;  Ease of use took several different forms: Caere's Typist, ahandheld-scanner-based system that makes OCR portable; Calera's macro thatoffers access to its OCR software from within Microsoft Word for Windows; andXerox Imaging Systems' graphical interface, a tremendous improvement over theprevious interface for its K5200 system.andM;Caere touts Typist, Windows 3 softwareandM;After hearing many claims and seeing early versions, we finally got to tryCaere's new Typist system ourselves.andP;  This combination of a nice handheldscanner and a version of OmniPage software seems to merit its lofty billing.andM;Typist can work from within any application.andP;  It serves as a keyboardinterrupt.andP;  Recognized characters are inserted into an active document as ifthose keys had been struck.andM;As we described earlier in more detail (see Vol.andP;  5, No.andP;  1, p. 19), thescanner is a 300-dpi model with special rollers that prevent skew.andP;  Itsviewing window lets a user see the text without having to stand directly overthe scanner.andM;Text can be scanned horizontally (in either direction) as well as from top tobottom; the software automatically figures out the direction and proceedsaccordingly.andP;  A lit &quot;marquee&quot; within the viewing window helps the user knowwhere to start and stop the scanning process.andP;  The software adjusts forvarying scanning speeds up to two inches per second.andM;Our single quibble with the process is that the user must hold down a buttonduring the scan.andP;  We'd prefer a click-on, click-off approach so that the usercould focus all energies on making a straight, smooth scan.andM;During recognition, a status window shows what proportion of the scanned areahas been processed.andP;  The scanned image is also visible, helping the userassess the scan's quality.andM;The Macintosh version of Typist ($695) was available as of the show; Caereplanned to release the DOS version ($595) in early November.andP;  Both versionswere demonstrated in San Jose.andM;Caere was also talking up OmniPage for Windows 3.0.andP;  Due by the end of thisyear, it will be provided as a free upgrade to anyone who buys the Windows2.X version of OmniPage between now and then.andM;Just as Caere ran a 16-bit version of OmniPage under the 8-bit Windows 2.Xinterface, it is preparing a 32-bit OmniPage for the 16-bit Windows 3.0.andP;  Thenewer process is more complex, but it has the same basis: CPU control isfrequently swapped between the application and the interface, rather thanhaving the two work constantly hand in hand.andM;Calera releases Word for Windows macroandM;A new macro called Scan In enables users to summon Calera's WordScan (orWordScan Plus) software from within Microsoft Word for Windows.andP;  This linkwas made possible by Windows 3.0's Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) facility.andM;To access Calera's software, the user merely selects the &quot;Scan/OCR&quot; commandfrom a menu.andP;  All of the software's capabilities, including the pop-up imageverifier, are accessible by this route.andP;  Recognized text is thenautomatically inserted into the Word for Windows document.andM;Calera's DDE work enables it to link its software to other Windowsapplications too, though the company announced no further plans.andP;  Theconnection to Word for Windows was simplified by use of the latter program'sWord Basic macro language.andM;Scan In is now included with WordScan and WordScan Plus.andP;  Previous WordScanPlus purchasers can get the macro free by calling Calera's technical supporthotline, (408) 986-8746.andM;Toshiba's ExpressReader is a year betterandM;A year ago, we saw an early prerelease version of a Toshiba omnifont OCRboard called ExpressReader.andP;  It was designed mainly for use by OEMs, VARs andsystem integrators, who could offer it as part of more complexconfigurations.andM;ExpressReader was finally shipped this summer.andP;  It has been refined since ourlast look.andP;  If not a clear leader in board-based OCR, it has at least becomequite respectable.andM;An AT with at least 640 KB of RAM is required to use the ExpressReader.andP;  Itworks with scanners from Abaton, Datacopy, Hewlett-Packard, Microtek, Ricohand Tokyo Electric Company, as well as with models that use the same engines.andO;The software that drives ExpressReader runs under Windows 2.1; a Windows 3.0version is due in the first quarter of 1991.andM;The demonstrator tested ExpressReader on a multicolumn page of proportionaltext that he supplied and on a single-column page of proportional text,containing several styles, of our choosing.andP;  Its accuracy was high on Romanand bold styles in both tests, but italics gave it some trouble on ourdocument.andM;Toshiba claims that &quot;ExpressReader is the fastest text recognition board youcan buy.&quot;andP;  Having spent less time with OCR boards than with software-only orhigher-end systems, we're not certain that's true, but its AMD 29000 RISCprocessor certainly helps.andP;  This system read our single page in about aminute.andM;In addition to common features (recognition of portrait- and landscape-modepages, recognition of prescanned TIFF files, etc.), ExpressReader offers someunusual ones.andP;  The most striking is its ability to pop up the portion of theoriginal image that corresponds to any selected text in the resulting file.andO;Leading OCR systems can pop up images of words that they cannot confidentlyidentify, but ExpressReader lets the user confirm any range of text.andM;Another nice feature is a spelling checker that brings up words similar toany selected one.andP;  A 30,000-word dictionary is included; users can defineother lexicons up to 1 KB in size, of which only one can be &quot;active&quot; at atime.andM;ExpressReader successfully analyzed the format of the multicolumn test page,dividing it into zones.andP;  The user can easily add, delete or renumber zones.andM;Text and image zones are defined separately.andP;  Text can be saved in formats ofabout 20 leading DOS word processors (although XyWrite is missing from thelist).andP;  Images can be saved only in compressed or uncompressed TIFF formats.andO;A function for recognizing tables and saving them in spreadsheet formats isbeing developed.andM;Automatic document feeders are supported, but there is no single command forrecognizing a stack of two-sided pages.andM;OEM or VAR applications of ExpressReader are likely to be available earlynext year.andM;XIS's GUI obliterates old complaintsandM;The RISC-based K5200 recognition system from Xerox Imaging Systems impressedus favorably in our recent study of high-end OCR systems (see Vol.andP;  5, No.andO;1).andP;  Its speed and accuracy were at or near the top on virtually everydocument we tested.andM;However, there was one glaring weakness in the K5200: an awkward,character-based user interface that made configuration balky andnonintuitive.andM;XIS is about to render such criticism archaic.andP;  Sometime in the first quarterof 1991, the K5200 will sport an excellent new graphical user interface basedon Windows 3.0.andP;  All K5200 owners will receive it free.andP;  Later in the year,its less expensive cousins, the K5000 and K5100, will also be GUI-ized.andM;In our view, the K5200's worst shortcoming was the user's inability to definemore than one recognition zone on a page.andP;  Even that single zone could onlybe defined numerically.andP;  The new interface lets the user scan the page, viewit at any of eight zoom levels (which are not fixed, but usually range up toabout six times actual size--plenty of magnification for the job),interactively mark up to 40 text and image zones per page, renumber the zonesand save a set of zones as a reusable template.andM;The verification process, already one of XIS's strengths, has been improvedwith a better graphical presentation.andP;  Verifier options (confirm character orword, skip to next questionable character, etc.) can be chosen from an iconmenu or by their old keyboard equivalents.andM;During verification, the user sees three types of information: the outputtext file; the original image of several words, providing context around aword of which the system isn't confident; and a blown-up image of thequestioned character(s) (see illustration).andM;Several nice touches bear special mention.andP;  Not only can recognition run as abackground task, but when it is doing so, a small window in the foregroundcontinuously shows the overall recognition &quot;confidence level.&quot;andP;  This way, theuser can be alerted to a poor image before the system has performed the fullbackground recognition.andM;Image zones, which are stored separately, are automatically given file namesthat indicate the document name, the page on which each image appears and itsorder on that page.andP;  For instance, in a document named &quot;UNTITLED,&quot; the firstimage on page one would automatically be named UNT00101; the second image onpage one, UNT00102.andP;  The user can rename these images within the program.andO;Images can be scaled by percentage, and their horizontal and verticalresolutions can be defined separately.andM;A new feature called &quot;TIFF Queue&quot; enables the user to build a list of TIFFfiles for batch recognition.andP;  The files can be grouped by job, with each jobhaving a different set of recognition settings.andM;To scan a stack of double-sided pages with the current interface, the usermust reset the page numbering scheme manually in mid-job.andP;  The new version,though, will have a simple &quot;flip document&quot; feature, similar to those offeredby XIS's main high-end competitors (Calera and Caere).andM;Extensive control-sensitive help, conforming to Windows 3 conventions, willalso be part of the new interface.andP;  The K5000 series has always beenpowerful.andP;  Now, XIS is presenting that power in a more palatable form.andP;  Themain obstacle toward purchasing one of these systems is about to disappear.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
