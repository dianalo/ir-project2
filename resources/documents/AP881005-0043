Trujillo is in charge of internal security in Colombia.   Last month the president offered a cease-fire, negotiations,pardons to guerrillas who surrendered and a chance for rebelleaders to speak before congress.   All six of Colombia's leftist guerrilla groups rejected theplan, calling it an ultimatum for surrender.   Gaviria was particularly critical of the country's largestguerrilla group, the Colombian Revolutionary Armed Forces, known byits Spanish acronym as the FARC.   Sunday and Monday FARC attacks killed 12 soldiers, six policemenand three civilians, the Defense Ministry said Monday.   ``The government authorizes full institutional support for thearmed forces to confront the guerrillas, because weakness orcomplacency doesn't result in peace,'' Gaviria said in an interviewwith the Bogota radio station Caracol.   Minister of Justice Guillermo Plazas said the guerrillas' answerto ``the olive branch offered by President Barco has been attackson the army, blowing up of pipelines and setting off bombs.''   The FARC has used a cease-fire during the last four years ``tocheat the government'' by building up its strength, Plazas said ina broadcast interview with the Bogota radio station RCN.   The FARC signed a truce with the government of PresidentBelisario Betancur four years ago. There has been sporadic fightingbetween the FARC and government security forces during the truce.   Another guerrilla group, the National Liberation Army, has blownup the country's main oil pipeline 85 times in the last two years.   Last Saturday the guerrilla group blew up the pipeline, whichcarries 225,000 barrels of oil a day from the Canon Limon field inthe northeast state of Arauca.   Last Wednesday the National Liberation Army set off a bomb inBogota as the car of a Texaco executive was passing by.   The executive, John Buttle, a Canadian, was not injured.   And last July the National Liberation Army kidnapped the ownerof General Pipe Co., of Houston, Jake Gambini. There has been noword on Gambini's fate.</TEXT></DOC>
