This amendment provides for optional eddy current inspectionsof the fuselage aft pressure bulkhead tee cap from the forward side ofthe bulkhead and increases the current repetitive inspection intervals.This action also expands the applicability to include certain Model DC-9-80series airplanes. This action is prompted by reports of cracks in the aftpressure bulkhead tee cap. If this condition is not corrected, bulkheadtee cap cracks may develop, which could result in rapid depressurizationand cause severe structural damage to the airplane.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>EFFECTIVE DATE: </T2>July 15, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESSES: </T2>The applicable service information may be obtainedfrom McDonnell Douglas Corporation, 3855 Lakewood Boulevard, Long Beach,California 90846, Attention: Director of Publications, C1-L00 (54-60).This information may be examined at FAA, Northwest Mountain Region, 17900Pacific Highway South, Seattle, Washington, or at 4344 Donald Douglas Drive,Long Beach, California.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2>Mr. Michael N. Asahara, Sr., AerospaceEngineer, Airframe Branch, ANM-122L, FAA, Northwest Mountain Region, LosAngeles Aircraft Certification Office, 4344 Donald Douglas Drive, LongBeach, California 90808; telephone (213) 514-6321.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>A proposal to amend Part 39 of theFederal Aviation Regulations by superseding AD 85-16-03, Amendment 39-5109(50 FR 30804; July 30, 1985), to require the inspections for cracks, andrepair or replacement, as necessary, of the aft pressure bulkhead tee cap,on certain McDonnell Douglas DC-9 series airplanes, was published in the<T4>Federal Register</T4> on February 1, 1988 (53 FR 2765). The commentperiod for the proposal closed March 28, 1988.Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate inthe making of this amendment. Due consideration has been given to the commentsreceived.The commenters requested that certain editorial changes be made to clarifythe identification of the area to be inspected, repetitive inspection procedures,and certain repair procedures. The comments do not significantly affectthe intent of the proposed rule. Therefore, the FAA concurs and suggestedchanges have been incorporated in this final rule, where appropriate.Since issuance of the Notice, the FAA has reviewed and approved Revision2 of McDonnell Douglas Alert Service Bulletin A57-191, dated December 22,1987, which incorporates clarification concerning repetitive inspectionsand closing actions. The final rule has been revised to incorporate thesechanges reflected by Revision 2. The FAA has determined that these revisions are for clarification purposesonly; they do not impose any additional economic burden on any operator,nor do they expand the scope of this AD.The FAA has been queried as to whether this action also supersedes AD 85-06-03,Amendment 39-5014 (50 FR 10936), which addressed this same subject. TheFAA notes that AD 85-06-03 was superseded by AD 86-16-03; this action nowsupersedes AD 86-16-03. Wording in the introduction to the final rule hasbeen revised to clarify this point.This final rule has also been revised to remove all references to the useof ``later FAA-approved revisions of the applicable service bulletin,''in order to be consistent with FAA policy in that regard. The FAA has determinedthat this change will not increase the economic burden on any operator,nor will it increase the scope of the AD, since later revisions of theservice bulletin may be approved as an alternate means of compliance withthis AD, as provided by paragraph D.After careful review of the available data, including the comments notedabove, the FAA has determined that air safety and the public interest requirethe adoption of the following rule, with the changes previously discussed.It is estimated that 740 airplanes of U.S. registry will be affected bythis AD, that it will take approximately 12 manhours per airplane to accomplishan optically-aided visal inspection, and 148 manhours per airplane to accomplishhigh and low frequency eddy current inspections from the forward side ofthe bulkhead. The average labor cost will be $40 per manhour. Based onthese figures, the total cost impact of the AD on U.S. operators is estimatedto be $355,200 and $4,380,000, respectively.The regulations set forth in this amendment are promulgated pursuant tothe authority in the Federal Aviation Act of 1958, as amended (49 U.S.C.1301, <T3>et seq</T3>.), which statute is construed to preempt state law regulatingthe same subject. Thus, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it isdetermined that such regulations do not have federalism implications warrantingthe preparation of a Federalism Assessment.For the reasons discussed above, the FAA has determined that this regulationis not considered to be major under Executive Order 12291 or significantunder DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26,1979); and it is further certified under the criteria of the RegulatoryFlexibility Act that this rule will not have a significant economic impact,positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities, becausefew, if any, Model DC-9 airplanes are operated by small entities. A finalevaluation has been prepared for this regulation and has been placed inthe docket.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39</ITAG>Aviation safety, Aircraft.<ITAG tagnum="84">Adoption of the Amendment</ITAG>Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator,the Federal Aviation Administration amends andSection; 39.13 of Part 39 ofthe Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 39.13) as follows:1.
