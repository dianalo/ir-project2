However, there were no common features of theCT findings in the 33 previously reported cases. Only one case with MRIfindings has been reported, showing a high intensity on SE 500/40. However,our 3 cases show three different patterns in their T/sub 1/ and T/sub2/ weighted images. These results suggest that the preoperative diagnosisof Rathke's cleft cyst is difficult at present.</TEXT></DOC>
