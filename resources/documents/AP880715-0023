WELCH</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The construction crews are still at work, but thehall where Michael Dukakis will claim his Democratic presidentialnomination next week is complete enough for party officials tobegin to breathe easier.   Easy enough, anyway, to feel assured the whole thing will be inplace by Monday's opening gavel and easy enough to bring theconstruction workers into the delegates' chairs Thursday for alittle ceremonial ribbon-cutting.   ``When you're at home watching this convention, having a Bud orwhatever, have one for us,'' Democratic party chief Paul Kirk toldthe assembled workers, who were treated to plastic-wrappedsandwiches on the floor of Atlanta's Omni Coliseum.   ``Don't take for granted it was just another day's work,'' hesaid. ``It's a page in history.''   The towering walls of podiums, risers, camera platforms andnetwork studios inside what is otherwise home for the Atlanta Hawksbasketball team are impressive. But the built-in features are sobig that the hall itself _ cramped anyway by arena standards _seems amazingly small.   In fact, the convention floor isn't big enough. More than halfthe 4,212 delegates will be in bleachers halfway up the side of thearena.   The inside of the hall looks like nothing if not a televisionset. That is basically what it is.   ``I approached it from that standpoint,'' said Rene Lagler, aCalifornia television set designer who planned the conventioninterior.   Lagler also came up with the color scheme. He says it's red,white and blue, but to others it looks like pink, gray and paleblue _ colors that the party officials say will look less harsh ontelevision screens.   ``On camera the whole thing will look red, white and blue,'' hesaid. ``Just squint: that's what it will look like on television.''   Some squinters, however, found the colors remained pink, grayand pale blue.   Kirk and Atlanta Mayor Andrew Young showed off the fancymoveable podium sections. They are controlled with hydraulic liftsby a stage manager who will sit behind the speakers _ and adjust tocompensate for the speaker's height. Nominee-to-be Dukakis is fivefoot eight.   Overhead, lights swiveled by remote control, as they will whenthe convention begins, and canned music poured from giant speakersthat were sniffed by bomb-detecting dogs before they were liftedoverhead. For delegates in seats so remote they can't see, gianttelevision screens will provide a view.   Mike McCurry, the convention's director of communications, saidthat while all looks pretty close to completion, there are constantdemands for adjustments.   ``I walked in here yesterday and thought, `My Lord, they're notgoing to be ready,''' McCurry said. ``But they've done a lot in twodays.''   Even as the ribbon was cut, however, television microwavereceivers were still being installed above studio ``skyboxes'' thatallow anchor people to look down on the whole spectacle. There wasa din of resumed hammering and sawing.   A workman in shorts scaled a rope ladder and crawled along asuspension system near the 12-story-high ceiling, adjusting thefocus of lights to please technicians below.   Just off the floor is the Hawks' office, where general managerStan Kasten declared the hall unrecognizable. ``It's amazing,'' hesaid.   Most of the 13,500 or so journalists won't even get in the hall,or will only part of the time. They're being accommodated in thevast Georgia World Congress Center, dubbed the ``Media Village.''There's plenty of room _ but it's across the street from where theaction is.   Outside, scores of satellite uplink trucks were being put inplace, their dish antennas pointed skyward. There's a mobile-homevillage of network equipment _ and the handful of trailers theDukakis and Jackson campaigns each will use as command posts.   Back inside, Lagler was looking over his labors when one of hishard-hatted workers came up with a question: When was the meetingto discuss tearing it all down after Thursday night?   ``That'll be another problem,'' Lagler said, ``getting all thisout of here.''</TEXT></DOC>
