The primal form ofinteraction is looking, or searching. A four-part taxonomy of searchingis given (intention, structure, language, and modality), and used asa descriptive basis for a review of relevant HCI literature and interfaceapproaches. The most important form of searching for casual use in browsing,defined here as searching without an explicit goal or intention. A three-partframework is presented for the design and evaluation of browsing interfaces- conceptual models of the interface, design guidelines, and evaluationcriteria. A closed-loop model of the user interface is presented, alongwith a novel categorization of relational data-base interfaces, by theway a user may approach the information (data-model-oriented, object-oriented,and domain-oriented) and by structural level (system, data-base, table,and tuple).</TEXT></DOC>
