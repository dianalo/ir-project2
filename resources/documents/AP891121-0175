Dissidents, including banned playwright Vaclav Havel, addresseda crowd of 150,000 people jamming Wenceslas Square without policeinterference. An actor later called for the resignations ofCommunist Party leaders, and demonstrators chanted: ``Punish!Punish! Punish!''   The comments by Premier Ladislav Adamec, relayed by participantsin the meeting, were a sharp break with current government policy.It was not clear what significance his statements would havebecause the head of government traditionally has far less powerthan the Communist Party leader.   Party chief Milos Jakes, in a television appearance Tuesdaynight, accused the demonstrators of trying to ``disrupt thesocialist system'' and ``unleash emotion and passions withunforeseeable consequences.''   Although he said he welcomed ``a dialogue with all who stand forsocialism even though they criticize abuses,'' he maintained a hardline, denouncing organizers of the demonstrations and saying the``cause of the working people and socialism ... is at stake.''   A Jakes ally, Prague Communist Party boss Miroslav Stepan, saidin a statement that the opposition was whipping up ``hysteria.''``We are calling on the workers of Prague, the members of thepeople's militia (police) to stand firmly,'' said the statementissued by the Prague party leadership.   Adamec told a delegation that included opposition leaders he wasin favor of a ``different concept of the leading role of theparty,'' and favored having non-Communists in the government,according to two members of the group, journalist Michael Horacekand composer Michael Kocab. Adamec's statement about non-Communistsin the government was not carried by the CTK state news agency.   Adamec also promised the government would not impose martiallaw, and he suggested dissidents no longer be persecuted.   The opposition members quoted him as saying the government wouldnot rule out talking with Charter 77, Eastern Europe's oldest humanrights group, which authorities previously refused to negotiatewith.   However, Adamec said, protests must stop and socialism mustremain intact.   Czechoslovakia's hard-line leaders have kept a tight rein onsociety and rejected the reforms transforming other East blocsocieties.   The leadership appears to be softening, however, in the face ofits biggest government crisis since the 1968 Soviet-led invasionthat snuffed out the ``Prague Spring'' reform period. The extent ofpublic discontent was underlined by the huge crowds demonstratingTuesday and on Monday, when 200,000 marched in the largestdemonstration ever.   State TV also reported protesters filled the streets ofBratislava, but it did not give a crowd estimate. At least 10,000marched there Monday.   On Tuesday, speakers addressed the crowd in Wenceslas Squarefrom the balcony of a state-run newspaper, Svobodne Slovo, whichhas criticized the government.   The Rev. Vaclav Maly, a dissident, read a message fromCzechoslovak Cardinal Frantisek Tomasek: ``We cannot wait anylonger. We need a democratic government. At this decisive moment,no one must stand aside.''   The crowd later dispersed, still crying,``Freedom! Freedom!''   Witnesses said police and armored vehicles surrounded the mainoffices of the federal government, but they did not interfere.   Also Tuesday, CTK reported the general prosecutor of the Czechrepublic had opened an investigation into the actions of securityforces who clubbed and fired tear gas at demonstrators Friday,injuring scores. Dissidents said one student was killed by policein the protest, but the government denied it.   Czechoslovak media devoted unusual coverage to Monday'sdemonstration, and employees of state TV voted to provide time onnews broadcasts for opposition opinion, a source said.   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the most importantexponent of reform in the East bloc, expressed strong supportTuesday for the changes sweeping Eastern Europe, includingCzechoslovakia.   ``I think the change is very important, and the importance ofthe change will be that it will create a better society, a moreopen society, a more democratic society,'' Gorbachev said in Moscow.   In the meeting with opposition leaders, Adamec said he favored``having in the federal government people with no membership in apolitical party and members of other political parties andespecially young people,'' Horacek said.   Horacek and Kocab belong to an organization of intellectualscalled Most, which means ``bridge.'' It promotes dialogue betweenauthorities and the opposition.   Adamec also said the government was open to talks and added:``We do not exclude anybody from the dialogue, including Charter77.''   ``We must free ourselves from the wrongdoings of the past,'' hewas quoted as saying.   In its report, CTK also quoted Adamec as saying: ``We shallprotect socialism, there can be no discussion about this.'' He saidpolitical changes were necessary but ``a dialogue about manyserious problems ... cannot be sensibly conducted in the street.''   In addition to the representatives of Most, the 10-memberdelegation included four members of the newly formed Civic Forumumbrella opposition group, as well as members of official Communistorganizations.   Havel walked with delegation members to the meeting but did nottake part, officials said.   Thousands of students were on strike in Prague and other cities.At the DAMU acting school in Prague, a center of the strikemovement, students displayed six letters from factories in Praguesupporting their demands for more democracy and an end to policebrutality. So far, workers have not been extensively involved inthe anti-government protests.   There were other signs of protest in the capital, includingposters condemning police brutality on shop windows and officebuildings.</TEXT></DOC>
