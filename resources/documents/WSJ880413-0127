With its INF treaty nearly wrapped up in the Senate, the administration that once decried the &quot;evil empire&quot; now is pursuing radical arms reductions with a momentum that has even Jesse Jackson applauding.    Historians may someday explain what turned Mr. Reagan into a utopian disarmer, but in the real world a START treaty will affect U.S. security for decades. With so much at stake, we'd rest easier if the administration gave more evidence that it's pursuing a coherent agreement. Instead it is roaring toward a pact without any apparent strategic vision.    To understand the dangers, consider what's already become clear in the debate over INF. That treaty has sailed through the Senate, partly from political opportunism and partly because it's recognized as largely meaningless. A Senate Intelligence Committee report acknowledged as much last month when it agreed with Senator Jesse Helms that the U.S. can't verify the number of Soviet SS-20 missiles, but that it doesn't matter because, with 10,000 other warheads in the Soviet arsenal, what's a few hundred more here or there?    Yet even a treaty as empty as INF turns out to have surprises. Pressed by Senators Dan Quayle and Sam Nunn, chief INF negotiator Maynard Glitman recently has said he believes INF bans not just SS-20s and ground-launched cruise missiles, but also certain &quot;futuristic&quot; weapons. Some of these weapons are the stuff of Buck Rogers, but a few already are getting Pentagon money.    One example is the &quot;remotely piloted vehicle,&quot; an unmanned craft that could loiter over a target for long periods before locating and attacking an enemy's radar or command center. Under INF, the U.S. won't be able to deploy any such system that has a range of between 500 kilometers and 1,500 kilometers, even if it carries only a non-nuclear bomb. So INF limits the West's ability to exploit its advantage over the Soviets in technology -- forever -- though no one knows what new technologies might prove useful in the future.    The administration may yet ask the Soviets if they also think INF covers &quot;futuristics,&quot; but why should the Soviets say anything more than, &quot;We agree to abide by the treaty as signed?&quot; The administration -- eager not to admit its treaty is flawed -- will happily take that for a yes, Sam Nunn will announce he's satisfied, everyone will wink, and America's contentious democracy will be bound by constraints the Kremlin will ignore.    The same kind of logic could do even more damage under START. While START is supposed to reduce the number of ballistic nuclear missiles -- the Big Bertha SS-18s and MXs -- the Soviets want it to cover cruise missiles as well. And the same members of the Reagan team who banned ground-launched cruises under INF now want to find a way to accommodate the Soviets again by giving away sea- and air-launched cruises under START.    Messrs. Reagan and Shultz would no doubt get their Nobel Prize, but the U.S. will have thrown away its best hope for defending its interests without nuclear weapons. Because they're so accurate, cruise missiles can use conventional bombs to destroy targets that only a few years ago required nuclear warheads. Improvements in accuracy already have allowed the U.S. to reduce its nuclear stockpile by 8,000 weapons -- without a treaty. Didn't someone say arms control was supposed to make the use of nuclear weapons less likely?    A START accord also is supposed to make U.S. forces less vulnerable to a Soviet first-strike, but a few ideas we've heard would do the opposite. Making START verifiable certainly would require banning mobile systems, which the Soviets have in abundance. In any event, the Senate Intelligence Committee says the U.S. doesn't now have enough satellites to verify START no matter how it's constituted. A treaty banning mobiles would also shut off future possibilities for the U.S. to deploy its own mobile systems, should maintenance of the strategic balance some day require that by-no-means unthinkable contingency.    Despite these and many other problems, the word we hear is that Mr. Shultz and his aides won't take no for an answer on START. They see their days in office waning and they want to strike while they have a chance at the history books. They might even settle for a &quot;framework agreement,&quot; a kind of promise-to-agree that gives the Senate no chance for review and wouldn't bind the Soviets. President Reagan, who campaigned successfully for a stronger country, could yet leave an ironic legacy: an America that is strategically confused and weaker. </TEXT></DOC>
