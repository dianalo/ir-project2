The April increase in the Producer Price Index was down from a0.6 percent March advance, leading many analysts to conclude thatworries over inflation had been overstated by the March increase.   They said if the volatile energy and food sectors were removed,the April price advance was a minuscule 0.1 percent.   ``It is hard to make a real scare story that inflation is takingoff based on these kinds of numbers,'' said David Wyss, aneconomist with Data Resources Inc.   For the first four months of the year, wholesale prices haverisen at an annual rate of 2.9 percent, not much changed from the2.2 percent increase for all of 1987.   ``The earlier fears that inflation was taking off weresubstantially overstated,'' said Jerry Jasinowski, chief economistof the National Association of Manufacturers. ``This reportconfirms that most of the price increases we have been gettingrecently have been in oil. There is no reason to believe that OPECwill be able to enforce control over oil markets enough to keepenergy prices rising.''   At the White House, spokesman Marlin Fitzwater called the report``good news. Producer price inflation remains low.''   The report sparked a rally in the bond markets as investorsconcluded there will be no additional pressure on the FederalReserve to drive interest rates higher to dampen demand.   Prices of long-term government bonds rose as much as $5 for each$1,000 in face value to yield 9.17 percent. On Thursday thebellwether 30-year issue's yield jumped to its highest point thisyear at 9.22 percent.   The Fed recently moved to make credit less available to thebanking system because of fears the economy was overheating. Thattightening prompted the nation's major banks to boost their primelending rate from 8.5 percent to 9 percent on Wednesday, the firstincrease since last October's stock market crash.   Other economists, however, insisted that the April price reportcontained some troubling signs that price increases will beaccelerating in the months ahead.   ``It would be a mistake to look at this report and sayinflationary pressures have abated,'' said Michael Evans, head of aWashington forecasting firm. ``I don't think this relief is goingto last.''   Energy prices, which had posted sharp declines from Septemberthrough February, accounted for half of the increase in the overallindex in April, rising 3.1 percent, the biggest jump since a 3.2percent rise in January 1987.   Gasoline costs advanced 0.7 percent, while home heating oil shotup 5.2 percent. Natural gas, which had declined in price in five ofthe last six months, rose 4.3 percent.   Analysts blamed the price pressures on rising world crude oilprices in late April. But since that time, oil prices haveretreated somewhat, leading some economists to predict the Aprilprice surge will be temporary.   Food costs rose 0.4 percent in April, down from a 0.7 percentMarch increase, as a sharp 16.3 percent drop in the price of eggsand smaller declines in the price of fruit, fish and beef offsetprice increases for pork, chicken, vegetables and coffee.   The financial markets took the economic news in stride. On WallStreet, the Dow Jones industrial average climbed 22.55 points toclose at 1,990.55.   Brokers noted that there were no unpleasant surprises in theproducer price index and instead drew inspiration from fallinginterest rates and a steady dollar.   The dollar finished slightly higher in domestic dealings butfell against the British pound, which has been gaining grounddespite central bank intervention to stem its rise.   In another economic report Friday, the government said totalbusiness sales surged 1.9 percent in March, the biggest advance inmore than a year, while business inventories were up a modest 0.3percent.   Analysts said the combination of rising sales and small declinesin inventories should translate into continued strong industrialproduction in the months ahead.   The Labor Department gave these additional details on its PPIreport for April:   _New car prices fell 0.5 percent in April, a big turnaround froma 1.0 percent increase in March.   _Capital equipment costs were up a moderate 0.2 percent, halfthe increase of the previous month.   _Children's clothing prices gained 0.6 percent, while men'sclothing costs gained 0.1 percent, the same as the gain recordedfor women's apparel.   The April increase brought the overall wholesale price index to106.9. This means a selection of wholesale goods costing $100during a 1982 base period would have cost $106.90 last month. Thisindex itself is not adjusted for seasonal variations, as are otherfigures in the report.</TEXT></DOC>
