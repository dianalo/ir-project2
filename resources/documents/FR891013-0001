Review Under Executive Order 12612 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">I. Introduction </ITAG>With this final rule, the Department of Energy (DOE) is amending its FinancialAssistance Rules to establish standards for program offices in settingup procedures for the objective merit review of discretionary financialassistance applications. The changes also allow recipients of financialassistance research awards authority, without obtaining prior approvalfrom the Contracting Officer, to (1) rebudget among categories; (2) carryover funds from one funding period to the next; (3) incur limited preawardcosts; and (4) extend project periods without additional funds. Also, today's rule establishes an outline for a Department-wide processfor the review of applications for financial assistance. Requests for financialassistance funds are to be reviewed and evaluated by the DOE based on scientificmerit of the project, applicant's qualifications, adequacy of applicant'sfacilities and resources, project appropriateness to the mission of theDOE, and other appropriate factors established and set forth by the cognizantprogram office. The DOE review process is to consist of review by DOE personnelfor scientific and technical merit and program policy matters and may includeexternal review by Federal (including DOE) and non-federal personnel eitheras part of a standing committee, ad hoc committee, or field reader reviewfor scientific and technical merit. The Federal/non-Federal compositionof the review groups may vary, as long as objective review standards aremaintained. Additionally, this rule allows the issuance of general solicitations suchthat applications which are in the subject area of one of the programslisted in the solicitation may be treated as having been in response tothe general solicitation. Finally, a provision regarding evaluations of applications provides that,upon request, the applicant will receive a written summary of the evaluation.The DOE has concluded that the other changes regarding prior approvals,carryovers, preaward costs and project extensions (which are the DOE'simplementation of recommendations stemming from the Federal DemonstrationProject) will provide additional flexibility to financial assistance recipientsand reduce the work involved in managing financial assistance awards withoutadversely affecting appropriate Federal oversight of certain awards. <ITAG tagnum="84">II. Changes to 10 CFR Part 600 </ITAG>Section 600.3 is amended by inserting in alphabetical order definitionsfor ``ad hoc committee,'' ``field readers,'' ``objective merit review,''``responsible official,'' and ``standing committee,'' and changing thedefinition of ``research.'' Section 600.9 is amended by revising paragraph (a)(1) to provide authorityfor program assistant secretaries to issue general solicitations. Paragraph(c)(10) is amended to allow program offices to establish due dates or periodsappropriate for the receipt of applications. Multiple receipt dates throughoutthe year may be established which would permit applications to be ``bunched''and reviewed in comparison to each other. Paragraph (c)(12)(vi) is changedto provide that solicitations must contain specific requirements for non-statutorycost sharing when cost sharing is to be considered in the selection process.Section 600.16 is amended by revising paragraph (a) to establish the responsibilityof the program office for setting up an objective merit review system andensuring its satisfactory functioning. A new paragraph (b) is added toset out basic review requirements, including the goal to normally obtainreview by at least three individuals who have no other responsibilitiesconcerning the financial assistance applications being reviewed. A newparagraph (c) has been added to outline requirements for comparative review.A new paragraph (d) has been added to describe the types of review processeswhich may be used, which include field readers, standing committees, andad hoc committees. A new paragraph (e) has been added establishing a requirementfor providing the applicant with an evaluation of his/her application.A new paragraph (f) has been added to address situations in which the reviewerhas an interest in the application being reviewed. A new paragraph (g)has been added to establish deviation procedures from this part of therule. Existing paragraphs (b) and (c) have been redesignated paragraphs(h) and (i). Section 600.31 is amended by including a provision allowing recipientsof financial assistance research awards to extend the final year of a projectperiod without receiving the prior approval of the DOE. Recipients musttake this action prior to the originally established expiration date andnotify the DOE within ten days of the extension. Section 600.32 is amended to allow recipients of financial assistance researchawards to carry over unexpended funds in a continuation award without theprior approval of the DOE. Section 600.103 is amended to eliminate all Federal prior approval requirementsfor a recipient of financial assistance research awards (including thosein OMB Circulars A-21 and A-110) except for change in objective or scope,temporary replacement or change of principal investigator, change of keypersonnel, and change of the institution to which the award is made. Itis also amended to establish the authority of these recipients to incurpre-award costs of up to 90 days prior to a new or renewal award. The sectionalso provides that, if a recipient takes such an action, the DOE is not,therefore, obligated to issue an award.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Discussion of Comments on Proposed Rule</ITAG>On March 15, 1989 (54 FR 10670), DOE published a proposed rule to establishstandards for program offices in setting up procedures for the objectivemerit review of discretionary financial assistance applications, and toimplement the provisions of the Federal Demonstration Project (FDP) whichwould allow recipients of financial assistance research awards expandedauthority to act in several areas without obtaining prior approval fromthe Contracting Officer. Written comments were to be submitted by April14, 1989. Three institutions of higher education submitted comments.All three commenters requested that DOE change its proposal which limitsthe recipient's ability to extend the length of the project period withoutadditional funds to the last budget period of a project period. They assertthat the proposed provision (600.31(d)(1)) is contrary to what is beingpermitted in the FDP which, they contend, allows any budget period to beextended. They also view reserving the extension without additional fundsauthority to the last budget period to be an unnecessary restriction.DOE has reviewed the applicable provision in the FDP and determined thelimitation in the proposed rule is not inconsistent with that provision.DOE has also verified with other Federal participants in the FDP that theintention and implementation of the applicable provision have been to limitthat authority to the final budget period of the project period. Additionally,it is noted that if recipients did have the authority to extend earlierbudget periods, funding needs for the project might well extend into alater fiscal year than the federal agency had anticipated, thereby complicatingits budget planning.For the reasons stated in the previous paragraph, DOE will continue tolimit the provision regarding extensions without additional funds to thefinal budget period as provided in the proposed rule.The three commenters also requested that DOE change the provision in theproposed rule that permits DOE to adjust the amounts awarded in futurebudget periods based on the amount the recipient estimates is remainingin the previously completed year (andSection; 600.32(c)(2)). They noted thatthis is not consistent with the similar provision in the FDP concerningcarryover and that such adjustments would have to rely on an estimate thatwould be of questionable reliability as it would be made well in advanceof the end of the budget year.DOE agrees with these comments and has changed the final rule to conformwith the provision regarding carryover in the FDP. The recipient will havethe ability to carryover funds without the approval of DOE, but will berequired to report to DOE the amount of funds unobligated in the FinancialStatus Report to be submitted after the budget period is over. A sentencehas been added which permits DOE to request recipients to provide informationin the progress report regarding budget expenditures.One commenter stated that the words ``* * * the costs must be otherwisein accordance with these rules'' in andSection; 600.103(g)(2)(iii) are confusingand unneeded. After careful consideration of the comment, DOE has concludedthat while some readers may see the phrase as simply expressing a truism(that is, a recipient may not do what it is not permitted to do), it isimportant to retain the phrase so that the removal of prior approval requirementsin the proposed rule not be interpreted as a general waiver of other portionsof DOE's financial assistance rules and the applicable OMB circulars. Forexample, a cost would still have to be allowable to be incurred, even ifagency prior approval were not needed to incur it.One commenter stated that Contracting Officers should have the authorityto approve pre-award costs retroactively. DOE's financial assistance rulescurrently provide that the Contracting Officer may approve pre-award costsprior to incurrence. Retroactive approval would require a deviation underandSection; 600.4. DOE did not propose to change the retroactive approvalrequirement in the proposed rule and still does not see a reason to doso.As a result of comments by DOE staff, the following clarifying changeshave been made to the proposed rule.The role of field readers acting as a standing committee in andSection; 600.16(d)(iii)is clarified to emphasize that even though geographically dispersed, theyshould operate as if they were a standing committee to the degree possible.In andSection; 600.31(d)(1), the apostrophe after ``recipients'' and theword ``award'' have been deleted to remove an awkward phrasing.In andSection; 600.31(d)(2), the introductory clause is moved to the middleof the sentence and the word ``other'' is deleted. In andSection; 600.31(d)(2)(i),the references to ``research'' and ``non-research'' are eliminated. Thesechanges retain the authority of a Contracting Officer to authorize extensionswithout additional funds for all types of financial assistance. This authoritycurrently exists in DOE's financial assistance rules and was inadvertentlylimited in the proposed rule.In andSection; 600.32(c)(2), the sentence ``The recipient shall not be entitledto reimbursement if a continuation award is not made'' has been relocatedin the section to make its meaning clearer.Section 600.103(g) is changed to drop the phrase ``in the absence of appropriations''.Absence of appropriations is envisioned to be already covered by the nextclause ``if an award is not subsequently made'' and raised the concernthat a Contracting Officer might be giving approval for pre-award costseven though funds have not been appropriated.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Review Under Executive Order 12291</ITAG>Today's rule was reviewed under Executive Order 12291 (February 17, 1981).The DOE has concluded that the rule is not a ``major rule'' because itspromulgation will not result in: (1) An annual effect on the economy of$100 million or more; (2) a major increase in costs or prices for consumers,individual industries, Federal, State, or local government agencies, orgeographic regions; or (3) significant adverse effects on competition,employment, investment, productivity, innovation, or on the ability ofUnited States based enterprises to compete in domestic or export markets.In accordance with requirements of the Executive Order, this rulemakinghas been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB).<ITAG tagnum="84">V. Review Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act</ITAG>These regulations were reviewed under the Regulatory Flexibility Act of1980, Public Law 96-354, 94 Stat. 1164, which requires preparation of aregulatory flexibility analysis for any regulation that will have a significanteconomic impact on a substantial number of small entities; i.e., smallbusinesses, small organizations, and small governmental jurisdictions.The DOE has concluded that the rule would only affect small entities asthey apply for and receive financial assistance and does not create additionaleconomic impact on small entities. The DOE certifies that this rule willnot have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of smallentities and, therefore, no regulatory flexibility analysis has been prepared.<ITAG tagnum="84">VI. Review Under the Paperwork Reduction Act</ITAG>No information collection or recordkeeping requirements are imposed uponthe public by this rulemaking. Accordingly, no OMB clearance is requiredunder the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, 44 USC 3501, <T3>et seq.,</T3> or OMB's implementing regulations at 5 CFR part 1320.<ITAG tagnum="84">VII. Review Under the National Environmental Policy Act</ITAG>The DOE has concluded that promulgation of these wholly procedural rulesclearly would not represent a major Federal action having significant impacton the human environment under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA)of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321, <T3>et seq.</T3> (1976)), the Council on Environmental Quality Regulations(40 CFR parts 1500 through 1508), and the DOE guidelines (10 CFR part 1021)and, therefore, does not require an environmental impact statement pursuantto NEPA.<ITAG tagnum="84">VIII. Review Under Executive Order 12612</ITAG>Executive Order 12612 requires that regulations or rules be reviewed forsubstantial direct effects on States, on the relationship between the NationalGovernment and the States, or in the distribution of power among variouslevels of government. If there are sufficient substantial direct effects,E.O. 12612 requires preparation of a federalism assessment to be used inall decisions involved in promulgating or implementing a regulation orrule.Today's regulatory amendments will have some direct effect on State recipientsof financial assistance who receive research awards. The number of awardsaffected is very small, however, and thus there will be insufficient directeffect to warrant the preparation of a federalism assessment by DOE.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 10 CFR Part 600</ITAG>Administrative practice and procedure, Cooperative agreements/energy, Copyrights,Debarment and Suspension, Educational institutions, Energy, Grants/energy,Hospitals, Indian Tribal governments, Individuals, Inventions and patents,Nonprofit organizations, Reporting requirements, Small businesses.In consideration of the foregoing, the DOE hereby amends chapter II oftitle 10 of the Code of Federal Regulations by amending part 600 as setforth below.<ITAG tagnum="21">Issued in Washington, DC October 6, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Berton J.

Any expectation concerningcost sharing shall be clearly stated. While cost sharing is encouraged,unless the cost sharing expectation is addressed in the solicitation, itshall not be considered in the evaluation process and shall be consideredonly at the time the award is negotiated.4. Section 600.16 is amended by revising paragraph (a), redesignating paragraphs(b) and (c) as (h) and (i), and by adding new paragraphs (b) through (g)as follows:<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 600.16</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Reviewer affiliation.</ITAG>(a) <T3>General. </T3>(1) Each responsible official must establish and publishin the <T4>Federal Register</T4> the details of the system of objective meritreview which covers the financial assistance program administered by eachcognizant program office within his or her jurisdiction within 120 daysof the issuance of this rule for existing programs and prior to the reviewof applications for new programs. More than one program may adopt the samesystem. If a program wants to review an application or group of applicationsusing the criteria and procedures of an already established review systemother than its own, it may do so by following the deviation procedure describedin paragraph (g) of this section. DOE employees designated by responsibleofficials to carry out the review process shall ensure that the evaluationof applications is conducted in a fair and objective manner.(2) Objective merit review of financial assistance applications is intendedto be advisory and is not intended to replace the authority of the programofficial with responsibility for deciding whether an award will be made.It is expected that the cognizant project/program officer (scientific monitor)who normally also reviews the proposals for technical/scientific merit,will, additionally, review it from a program policy perspective. Nevertheless,the objective merit review system must set forth the relationship betweenthe reviewing individuals, or the review committees or groups, and theofficial who has the final decision-making authority. In defining thisrelationship, the system must set out, as a minimum, the decision-makingand documentation processes to be followed by the authorized official responsiblefor selection when an adverse recommendation has been received throughthe objective merit review process.(3)(i) This section applies to all new and renewal applications (exceptapplications for conferences/symposia and for awards which come under thecriteria of paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of this section) in programs which makediscretionary financial assistance awards and to any other financial assistanceprograms in which objective merit review is required by the authorizinglegislation.(ii) For projects in which multiple renewals are probable, an objectivemerit review need not necessarily be done at each renewal, but insteadat appropriate points in the overall project period. A determination thata project need not be reviewed at each renewal shall be made in writingby the project officer at the time the initial award is issued, or at leastone year prior to the date a renewal award would be issued, and concurredin by an official at least one level above the official responsible forselecting the application for award. The determination shall also indicatethe reports required under the award. The criteria on which the determinationthat a project need not be reviewed at each renewal is based shall be includedin the system of objective merit review to be established by the responsibleofficial in accordance with paragraphs (a) (1) and (2) of this section.(4) Each responsible official shall insure consistency among DOE fieldoffices in the implementation of the review system(s) for his/her programarea.(5) Each formal review system must contain the elements listed in paragraphs(b) through (e) of this section.(b) <T3>Basic review standards. </T3>(1) Each application may be assessed froma policy/programmatic perspective prior to undergoing merit review. Thosethat meet policy and programmatic considerations shall generally be reviewedby at least three qualified persons in addition to the official responsiblefor selection.(2) The reviewers of any particular application may be any mixture of federalor non-federal experts, including individuals from within the cognizantprogram office, except as indicated otherwise below (see paragraphs (b)(3),(5) and (d)(2)(ii) of this section). The DOE shall select external (non-DOEFederal or non-federal) reviewers on the basis of their professional qualificationsand expertise in the field of research.(3) In selecting persons in accordance with andSection; 600.16(b) (1) and(2) to review applications, such selection of additional reviewers shallnot include, to the extent possible, anyone who, on behalf of the FederalGovernment, performed or is likely to perform any of the following dutiesfor any of the applications:(i) Providing substantive technical assistance to the applicant;(ii) Approving/disapproving or having any decision-making role regardingthe application;(iii) Serving as the project officer or otherwise monitoring or evaluatingthe recipient's programmatic performance;(iv) Serving as the Contracting Officer (CO), or performing business managementfunctions for the project; or (v) Auditing the recipient or the project.Anyone who has line authority over a person who is ineligible to serveas a reviewer because of the above limitations is also ineligible to serveas a reviewer.(4) It may occasionally be necessary, after the fact, to change projectofficer designation, thereby resulting in an individual who participatedin the review of an application being appointed as the project officer.This will not be considered a violation of this policy of objective meritreview provided the assignment was not expected when the review was conducted.(5) Persons outside the cognizant program office must not have been employeesof that office, including having line authority over that office, for oneyear prior to participation as a reviewer in the objective merit reviewprocess for the program.(c) <T3>Comparative review. </T3>(1) In order to enhance the validity of theevaluation and rating process, applications can be evaluated in comparisonto each other.(2) If a program area has issued a program notice, the responsible officialmay implement review procedures which will result in applications beingevaluated in comparison to each other. Applications in response to thatnotice may be assigned to a group of field readers, to a standing committee,or to an ad hoc committee, as discussed below, which is capable of reviewingthem, and may be considered along with other applications which were submittedin response to the program notice. Such an application may also be eligiblefor review under an applicable program announcement. For solicitations,review procedures may also permit comparative evaluation with field readers,a standing committee, or an ad hoc committee being used as appropriate.(d) <T3>Types of review groups_</T3>(1) <T3>Field readers. </T3>(i) Objective merit review of applications maybe obtained by using field readers to whom applications are sent for reviewand comment. Field readers may also be used as an adjunct to financialassistance application review committees when, for example, the type ofexpertise needed or the volume of financial assistance applications tobe reviewed requires such auxiliary capacity.(ii) Safeguards should be instituted to ensure that field readers clearlyunderstand the process, their role, and the criteria upon which the applicationsare to be evaluated.(iii) For those situations in which a standing committee is the appropriatereview mechanism (see paragraph (d)(2) of this section), but a group offield readers must be used instead, it should function as nearly like acommittee as possible. For example, if all members of the standing committeewere to evaluate all of the applications under review, then all field readersmust receive all of the applications to be reviewed even though they arein geographically separate locations and all field readers should be instructedto follow the procedures established for evaluating the applications.(2) <T3>Standing committees.</T3> (i) Standing committees are normally appropriatewhen required by legislation or when the following conditions prevail:(A) A sufficient number of applications on specific topics to justify theuse of a standing committee(s) is received by the program on a regularbasis in accordance with a predetermined review schedule;(B) There are a sufficient number of persons with the required expertisewho are willing and able to (<T3>1</T3>) accept appointments, (<T3>2</T3>) serve over reasonably protracted periods of time, and (<T3>3</T3>) convene at regularly scheduled intervals or at the call ofthe chairperson; and (C) The legislative authority for the particular program(s) involved extendsfor more than one year.(ii) Persons outside the cognizant program office shall constitute at leasthalf the reviewers on such committees unless a deviation from this requirementhas been approved under andSection; 600.16(g) below.(3) <T3>Ad hoc committees. </T3>(i) Ad hoc review committees may not exceedone year in duration and are appropriately used when use of a standingcommittee is not feasible or when one of the following conditions prevails:(A) A small number of applications is received on an intermittent basis;(B) The program is one of limited duration, usually less than one year;(C) The applications to be reviewed have been solicited to meet a specificprogram objective and cannot appropriately be reviewed by a standing committeebecause of subject matter, time constraints, or other limitations;(D) The volume of applications received necessitates convening an additionalcommittee(s) of available reviewers; or (E) It is determined that the applications submitted have special reviewrequirements, e.g., construction of a facility, the complexity of subjectmatter cuts across the areas of expertise of two or more standing committees,or the subject matter is of a special, nonrecurring nature.(ii) Ad hoc committees may not be used for reviewing financial assistanceapplications for any program for which a standing committee has been established(except for paragraph (d)(3)(i)(D) of this section) unless a deviationis approved under andSection; 600.16(g) below.(e) <T3>Review summary. </T3>Upon request, applicants are to be provided witha written summary of the evaluation of their application.(f)<T3> Reviewers with interest in application being reviewed. </T3>Reviewersmust comply with the requirements for the avoidance of conflict of interestestablished in andSection; 600.17. In establishing a system of objectivemerit review required in andSection; 600.16(a)(1), the responsible officialshall develop procedures which will permit DOE to evaluate whether a conflictof interest exists. A committee or group of field readers which includesas objective merit reviewers any individuals who cannot meet the requirementsof andSection; 600.17 or the program's review procedures, with regard toa particular application being reviewed, e.g., officials mentioned in paragraphs(b) (3) and (5) of this section, shall operate as follows:(1) These individuals or officials may not review, discuss, and/or makea recommendation on an application(s) in which they have a conflict ofinterest.(2) In the case of a review committee, the committee member must absenthimself or herself from the committee meeting during the review and discussionof the application(s) in which he/she has a conflict of interest.(g) <T3>Deviations. </T3>(1) In any instance in which a program's pre-establishedreview system is not to be used to review an application, group of applications,or class of applications, written prior approval for utilization of a differentprocedure, which itself must, to the extent possible, conform to the provisionsof this section pertaining to objective merit review, must be obtainedfrom the responsible official or his or her designee.(2) If the deviation sought applies to a class of applications and constitutesa deviation from the requirements of this part, approval for deviationmust be obtained in accordance with andSection; 600.4. If such request fordeviation is approved, all details of the review procedure utilized andthe proceedings and determination must be fully documented.<ITAG tagnum="37">* * * * *</ITAG>5.
