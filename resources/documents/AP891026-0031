Reps. Mary Rose Oakar, D-Ohio, and Nick Rahall, D-W.Va., want tomeet with Gen. Michel Aoun, the leader of Lebanon's predominantlyChristian army who has rejected the peace plan, according tosources who spoke on condition of anonymity.   However, the State Department has banned most travel byAmericans to Lebanon because the situation ``is so dangerous thatno U.S. citizen can be considered safe from terrorist acts.''   Eight Americans are being held hostage by pro-Iranian radicals.   Rahall's office said it could ``neither confirm nor deny it, forsecurity reasons.'' A spokesman for Ms. Oakar, Jim Belles, said hecould not obtain information about her plans.   Ms. Oakar, who like Rahall is of Lebanese descent, tried tovisit Lebanon in August, but sources said the State Departmentadvised her to cancel the trip.   U.S. passports are invalid for travel to Lebanon unless specialpermission is obtained. Violation of the ban can be punishable byimprisonment or a fine.   The U.S. embassy was evacuated last month after Aoun made veiledthreats to take American hostages to draw attention to his fightfor expulsion of 40,000 Syrian troops.   ``We don't oppose their talking to him (Aoun), but we can'toffer any support or help if they get in trouble,'' said oneofficial who spoke on condition of anonymity.   Meanwhile, the White House ruled out pressuring Aoun to acceptthe plan.   ``That's ... an internal matter for Lebanon and the variousfactions there to deal with,'' said presidential spokesman MarlinFitzwater.   The plan adopted by Christian and Moslem legislators inclosed-door meetings in Saudi Arabia would shift political controlfrom the Christian minority to the Moslem majority.   Aoun called on Lebanese lawmakers to reject the plan when itcomes up for a vote next month.</TEXT></DOC>
