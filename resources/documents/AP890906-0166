At a court hearing, Frederick Robinson said prosecutors should beordered to request Reagan's notes of various meetings so that theycan be turned over as part of Poindexter's defense.   Notes from then-Vice President George Bush should be turned overfor Poindexter's review, Robinson said, as well as notes from formerWhite House Chief of Staff Don Regan and then-Defense SecretaryCaspar Weinberger.   Poindexter's lawyers assert that all of Poindexter's actions wereapproved by higher-ups in the Reagan administration and that ``a lotof people took notes,'' Robinson told U.S. District Judge HaroldGreene.   He said the defense needs those notes ``so that we can ... testtheir credibility'' if the notes' authors are called as witnesses atPoindexter's trial.   Robinson referred to numerous statements by Bush and others thatthe then-vice president wasn't present at key Cabinet-level meetingsin the Iran-Contra affair. But ``any time he missed a meeting,Admiral Poindexter briefed him'' afterwards, Poindexter's lawyersaid of Bush.   Robinson focused on what he said was a meeting in mid-1986between Reagan and Poindexter. It related to questions from Housecommittees asking whether the administration was assisting theNicaraguan Contras during a congressional ban on military aid to therebel force.   One of the charges against Poindexter is that he obstructedCongress in sending responses to Congress in July 1986 that referredto letters sent a year earlier by his predecessor, Robert McFarlane.   McFarlane's letters denied that North and the National SecurityCouncil staff were supplying military advice or raising funds forthe rebel force.   McFarlane subsequently pleaded guilty to withholding statementsfrom Congress in connection with the letters.   The indictment against Poindexter says he ``well knew andbelieved'' McFarlane's 1985 letters ``were false.''   Poindexter ``went to the president to talk about'' thecongressional responses, Robinson told the judge.   Greene asked Robinson whether he was suggesting that ``thepresident said, `You go ahead and do this.'''   ``Yes,'' said Robinson. The lawyer asserted that Reagan said ineffect, ``I want these things done.''   ``I think that the president's notes ... will show hisdiscussions about the letters that were sent to Congress and theappropriateness of any response,'' Robinson added. He said themeeting would show ``presidential approval and ratification of thatactivity.''   Poindexter wants the judge to direct the office of independentcounsel Lawrence Walsh to request some of Reagan's notes so thatthey can be turned over to the former national security adviser.   Christian Mixter, a lawyer for the prosecution in the Poindextercase, noted that in the Iran-Contra criminal case against OliverNorth, ``we were quite willing to make requests of the presidentourselves'' to obtain typewritten excerpts of Reagan's diaries.   But Mixter noted that was a case of ``voluntary compliance'' andthat when North's lawyers subpoenaed Reagan, the Justice Departmentasked to be heard on the question of executive privilege. U.S.District Court Judge Gerhard Gesell quashed the subpoena for Reaganat the North trial.   ``I believe the independent counsel is not obligated to providematerials from the former president,'' said Mixter.   Poindexter's lawyer responded that White House lawyers ``havedirected us back to the independent counsel'' on requests fordocuments from the Reagan administration.   Poindexter is charged in the Iran-Contra scandal with conspiracy,two counts of obstructing Congress and two counts of making falsestatements.</TEXT></DOC>
