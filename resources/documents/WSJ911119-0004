Analysts said the deal may be an attempt by BCE to form acontrol block of friendly shareholders at Teleglobe. &quot;I thinkthis is an indirect takeover by BCE of Teleglobe,&quot; saidDouglas Cunningham, an analyst at BBN James Capel Inc. inToronto. Mr. Cunningham said that BCE has a relationship withMr. Sirois, who in turn is friendly with another bigTeleglobe holder, Quebec's Caisse de depot et placement, theprovincial government's pension fund agency. Mr. Cunninghamnoted that together, BCE, Mr. Sirois and Caisse de depot willhold a fully diluted 47% stake in Teleglobe.</LP><TEXT>   Under Canadian law, telephone companies can't own morethan 33.3% of Teleglobe. Teleglobe's main unit providesoverseas telecommunications services. BCE is the parent ofBell Canada, Canada's largest telephone company. BCE has longbeen unhappy with both Teleglobe management and the 33.3%rule.   Mr. Sirois's holding company, National Telesystem Ltd.,said it is buying the Teleglobe stake from BCE for&quot;strategic&quot; reasons. A spokesman for Mr. Sirois declined toelaborate.   A BCE spokeswoman said there isn't any agreement with Mr.Sirois or others to act together regarding Teleglobe. Thespokeswoman said BCE decided to sell part of its Teleglobestake because Mr. Sirois offered a good price.   BCE agreed to sell 3,039,076 Teleglobe common shares andTeleglobe notes convertible into 2,460,924 Teleglobe commonshares to Mr. Sirois's National Telesystem for 23 millionCanadian dollars (US$20.3 million) cash and a C$40.3 million90-day promissory note.   ---   Corrections andamp; Amplifications                                                                                                          CHARLES SIROIS resigned last week as a director and lastDecember as chairman of BCE Mobile Communications Inc., thecellular telephone subsidiary of BCE Inc. of Montreal.Yesterday's edition incorrectly said that Mr. Sirois resignedlast week as chairman of BCE Mobile Communications.
