(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Evelyn Flaherty didn't know it, but whenthe annual commemoration of Elvis Presley's death rolled aroundthis year, her phone would start ringing as fast as you can say``Elvis lives.''   The 11th anniversary of Presley's death is Tuesday, and managersof Graceland, the singer's former residence in Memphis, havescheduled their regular round of events to mark the occasion.   A brochure outlining the anniversary program listed the phonenumber ELVIS-88 for fans wanting to check the schedule.   That number, however, is to Mrs. Flaherty's home. The correctElvis number is ELVIS-87, the same as last year. The Elvis linecouldn't be pushed up a digit this year because that number alreadywas in use.   Mrs. Flaherty said the Elvis calls started several weeks ago andshe estimated the total as ``in the dozens,'' although thefrequency has increased during the past few days.   ``Some of them wanted to know what we thought about Elvis beingalive,'' she said Wednesday. ``We told them we didn't think hewas.''   Todd Morgan, a spokesman for Graceland, said managers of theresidence have apologized for any inconvenience to Mrs. Flaherty.   ``We will provide her with tickets for four to tour all ofGraceland's attractions on us, just as soon as we can get her offthe phone,'' Morgan said.</TEXT></DOC>
