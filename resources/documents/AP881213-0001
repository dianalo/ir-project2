(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A woman who force-fed her 4-year-old daughter afatal dose of salt as punishment was convicted of second-degreemurder Tuesday, but a charge against the father was dismissed.   ``This child died of salt poisoning,'' Commonwealth's AttorneySkip Burkart said. ``We're talking about a massive amount of saltthis child was forced to eat.''   Roanoke County Circuit Judge Kenneth Trabue found Beth MichelleRiggs, 36, guilty in the May 17 death of her daughter, Heather,after accepting a plea agreement. Mrs. Riggs had agreed to plead nocontest to the murder charge and guilty to involuntary manslaughterwith the understanding she would be convicted on only one of thecharges.   The judge found her guilty of the murder charge but threw outcharges of murder and willful child neglect against the father, JackFrancis Riggs, 39, after finding there was no evidence heparticipated in the fatal punishment.   Mrs. Riggs, who wept at times throughout the day-long hearing,embraced her husband briefly before deputies led her to jail.   Trabue set sentencing for February. She faces up to 20 years inprison.   The prosecutor said the couple routinely kept Heather, aColombian child they had adopted, locked in her room while they weregone during the day to keep her from eating sweets.   On May 16, one of the girl's four brothers told his mother thatHeather had eaten sugar, Burkart said. Mrs. Riggs took the bowl,dumped salt in it and force-fed her daughter up to 20 spoonfuls ofsalt as punishment, he said.   After the girl began vomiting, Mrs. Riggs ordered her to clean upthe mess, the prosecutor said.   The girl was taken to a hospital in a coma and died the next day.Burkhart said Mrs. Riggs failed to tell doctors how much salt thegirl had ingested, and doctors testified they did not treat the caseas a poisoning.   Defense attorney James Swanson argued for an involuntarymanslaughter conviction, which would have carried up to 10 years inprison, by saying Mrs. Riggs never intended to harm her daughter.   ``We're dealing with table salt,'' he said. ``We're dealing witha substance available on every table in this country. She had noidea of the lethal effect.''   The prosecutor said Riggs probably will regain custody of thecouple's four sons, who have been living with their grandparents.Authorities got their initial clues about the salt-poisoning fromstatements the boys made to their schoolteachers.</TEXT></DOC>
