Mr. Carter hit a home run on this one, but he missed touching second base by not pointing a finger at a major contributory factor -- the motion-picture industry. Films exert a profound influence on an impressionable audience, although the industry will try to hide behind the old saw that it merely reflects the mores of its patrons. Simply put, the movies have helped make profanity chic and acceptable.    To compound the disgrace, some movie critics blithely overlook the gross crudities that usually have nothing to do with the story line and in many instances are a means of diverting attention from inept actors, scriptwriters or directors. These so-called critics seem to be afraid of being labeled prudish or (horrors!) &quot;not with it,&quot; and in the process abdicate their responsibilities to the public.    Paul R. Maracin   San Diego   ---   Mr. Carter's position seems to be that we should revert to the days when grandmothers (and other &quot;ladies&quot;) were shielded from obscene language.    Now, I hold no brief for disgusting speech, whether delivered to man, woman or child. Generally it tells more about the speaker than about the topic under discussion. Yet to draw the line, as Mr. Carter does, between speech acceptable to men as a class as against women as a class conveys a sexist attitude more objectionable, perhaps, than being foulmouthed. If a man or a woman has the urge to curse, he or she should give the entire audience (grandmothers or not) due consideration.    E. Scott Pattison   Dunedin, Fla.   ---   Three cheers for Hodding Carter's commentary. Alexander Pope made a similar comment more than 200 years ago in his &quot;Essay on Man&quot;:    Vice is a monster of so frightful mien,    As to be hated needs but to be seen;   Yet seen too oft, familiar with her face,    We first endure, then pity, then embrace.   R.G. Faith   Greenbrae, Calif.   ---   Many thanks for Hodding Carter's timely article. I've made multiple copies that will be kept in my briefcase. Now, instead of risking life and limb admonishing churlish individuals -- who do seem to be everywhere these days -- I'll simply hand them a copy of Mr. Carter's article and move on. I intend to start on the commuter train this evening.    Frederick J. Leslie   Fairfield, Conn.</TEXT></DOC>
