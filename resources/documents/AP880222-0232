This stunned West Europeans, who felt the Americans hadnot adequately consulted them on such a proposal, which theystrongly opposed.   From that point, it was increasingly clear that major reductionsin nuclear arms were likely. The first step was taken this pastDec. 8 when Reagan and Gorbachev signed the treaty eliminatingland-based intermediate-range nuclear missiles, representing about4 percent of their arsenals.   With the INF treaty, as it is called, expected to win U.S.Senate approval within a few months, and the superpowers alreadyagreed in principle to 50 percent cuts in their long-range, orstrategic, nuclear arms, NATO finds itself facing tough choicesabout adjusting its military posture.   One of the most difficult and immediate choices is whether andhow to modernize the U.S.-controlled nuclear weapons that willremain in Europe after the American cruise and Pershing 2 rocketsare withdrawn.   The gist of the debate is that most NATO governments, includingthe United States, say this upgrading is vitally important, whilemost factions in West Germany's coalition government stronglyoppose it.   Lord Carrington of Britain, the NATO secretary general, says thealliance must ignore Soviet warnings that an upgrading of thenuclear arms would inflame the arms race and violate the spirit ofEast-West disarmament efforts.   ``If you don't modernize, eventually you don't have any nuclearweapons, which they (the Soviets) would like,'' Carrington said inan interview.   The West Germans have clear reasons for disliking the more than2,000 NATO nuclear weapons that are candidates for modernization:most of them, including artillery, bombs and land-based missiles,are in West Germany; if fired the likelihood is that many wouldstrike only in East or West Germany. While their nation is divided,Germans still regard themselves historically as one people.   The West German government in Bonn wants NATO to opennegotiations with the Soviets on reducing short-range nuclear arms_ those with ranges of less than 500 kilometers (310 miles) and notcovered by the U.S.-Soviet treaty. The United States, France,Britain and other alliance members fear this would play into thehands of Gorbachev, who has said repeatedly that his aim is to ridEurope of all nuclear weapons.   Some European analysts worry that it eventually could be theundoing of NATO itself.   ``The reopening of the nuclear issue in Germany has thepotential ultimately to break up the alliance,'' Pierre Lellouche,deputy director of the Institut Francais des RelationsInternationales, wrote in a recent newspaper column.   From the U.S. viewpoint, improvement of nuclear weaponsremaining in Europe is directly linked to the question of whethersome of the American troops in Europe, mostly in West Germany, maybe pulled out.   The Reagan administration has said repeatedly that it opposesany troop withdrawals. Yet U.S. Secretary of Defense Frank Carluccisaid recently that if Europe lost its short-range nuclear arms _either through negotiation or obsolesence _ a troop pullout mightbe considered.   America's allies have gotten the message.   ``Under whatever administration comes next in the United States,there will be more pressure for reducing the American commitment inEurope,'' said De Hoop Scheffer, the Dutch ambassador to NATO.   Said another NATO ambassador, speaking privately: ``There is afeeling here that despite the best intentions of the currentadministration, it's only a matter of time before the U.S. trooplevels are reduced.''   Manfred Woerner, the West German defense minister who is due tosucceed Carrington as NATO's top political officer this summer, wasquoted as saying in a recent newspaper interview that he saw ``acertain evolution'' in U.S. thinking that raises some questionsabout how long the West Europeans can count on the United States tokeep its troops on the continent.   ``That's why our European role (in NATO) must reflect our owninterests,'' he said.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, Feb 28</NOTE></DOC>
