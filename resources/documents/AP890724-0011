Tired of waiting for thebus? Fed up with rising air fares?   Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner is trying to find outwhat Americans want to do about it.   But Skinner, in starting today a series of nationwide publichearings aimed at coming up with a national transportation policy,is asking for ideas, not complaints.   ``You shouldn't go if you're just going to say, `We've gotgridlock, somebody ought to do something about it,' because we knowthat,'' said Skinner in an interview. ``These are needs and ideasessions.''   Skinner, who carries a regular Washington Metrorail card in hiswallet and drives to work on the same jammed roads as this region'sother commuters, said the nation has been taking transportation forgranted.   And he makes it clear this includes the Reagan administration.Skinner is a former federal prosecutor and Chicago area transitchief brought to Washington by President Bush.   ``We've had a policy, but there hasn't been a coordinatednational policy,'' he said. ``There was an absence of planning, andI happen to be a planner.''   Skinner said the nation's airports, highways, bridges, waterwaysand mass transit system are simply wearing out.   ``We're going to have to rebuild it and replace it, or we're notgoing to be able to rely on it anymore,'' he said.   Among the most critical problems are a lack of planning for newairports, Skinner said, and $80 billion worth of work on thecountry's deteriorating bridges.   The Transportation Department has scheduled 33 meetings incities ranging from Moscow, Idaho, to New York City.   Meetings are to be moderated by department experts in variousfields, with sessions focusing on different subjects according tothe location.   In Moscow on Wednesday, for example, it's rural needs, includinghealth care delivery, intercity buses and rail transport. In NewYork on Sept. 8, it will be drug and alcohol use in the commercialtransportation system and federal research and development.   The last meetings will be Sept. 11-12 in Boston.   Skinner has asked for expert testimony at the hearings as wellas comments from anyone interested in improving any aspect ofhighway, rail, air, or water transportation.   Skinner has some of the most wide-ranging responsibilities inthe administration. He is Bush's point man in the Alaskan oil spillbecause his department oversees both the Coast Guard and pipelines.He's also issued key decisions affecting issues ranging fromautomobile mileage standards to air terrorism.   The department is accepting written suggestions until Sept. 1.Skinner said he hopes to have a new set of transportation policiesin place before the end of his first year in the Cabinet.   What will it all amount to when the policy is set?   Skinner sees ambitious results affecting every American:   ``Maybe it will eliminate gridlock. Maybe it will make it easierfor you to get to work. Maybe it will hold down air fares. Maybe itwill make you more productive in your job by making it easier toget to various places in the country.''</TEXT></DOC>
