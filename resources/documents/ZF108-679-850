(chart)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>You can now perform near miracles with text and graphics that you couldn'thave imagined before you owned a Mac.andP;  Back in the Dark Ages (before 1984),our biggest graphics thrill was seeing a picture of Snoopy made of asterisksemerging from our Teletypes.andP;  We can now create highquality graphics with avariety of programs, but unless you're an artist, creating graphics fromscratch is a real effort.andP;  And for those of us who are on a limited budget,desktop scanners are priced out in the ozone (what's left of it, anyway).andO;Fortunately, there's a solution: hand-held scanners.andM;Besides being inexpensive, light, and easy to set up and use, hand-heldscanners have a distinct advantage over flatbed and sheetfed scanners: Theycan take graphics straight out of books.andP;  You can even scan wallpaper byrunning a unit down a wall.andP;  (Try that with a flatbed!) The resolution ofcolor hand-held scanners is generally too low for getting line art into acomputer, but black-and-white scanners can handle the job.andP;  In a pinch, theblack-and-white scanners even work well as input devices for OCR (opticalcharacter recognition).andM;We tested four hand-held scanners, each costing less than $700.andP;  Three wereblack-and-white models: the ScanMan Model 32 from Logitech, the LightningScanfrom Thunderware, and the Complete Half-Page Scanner/400 (CHPS) from CompletePC.andP;  The fourth was the color ClearScan from NCL.andP;  We also looked at severalother interesting scanners that were still under development while thisarticle was being written (see the &quot;On the Horizon&quot; sidebar) but that shouldbe available by the time you read this.andM;The Scanners at HandandM;The differences among the blackand-white scanners are cosmetic.andP;  All threeuse similar scanner heads (manufactured by Omron) and have selectableresolutions of 100 to 400 dpi.andP;  Each also has built-in selectable ditherpatterns for producing pseudohalftones, and they offer software to convertthe dithers into true grayscale images.andP;  Gray-scale conversions shrink theimage size, however, because a 6-x-6-pixel dither cell (36 pixels) isconverted into a single gray pixel.andP;  Both black-and-white and color scannerslet you save scanned images in various resolutions (usually 100, 200, 300, or400 dpi) and formats (such as PICT, TIFF, or MacPaint).andM;The color NCL ClearScan uses a scanner head manufactured by Mitsumi and has amaximum resolution of 90 dpi for each of the three primary colors - red,green, and blue.andP;  The hardware can detect 16 intensities (4 bits) for each ofthe primary colors, resulting in 12 bits, or 4,096 colors, but curiously, thesoftware produces only 256-color (8-bit) output.andP;  ClearScan also does 4- and8-bit grayscale scanning.andM;All the hand-held scanners consist of two parts, a scan head and aSCSIinterface box.andP;  Just plug the scan head into the SCSI-interface box,which in turn gets connected to your Mac's SCSI port.andP;  The CHPS has only oneconnector, so it'll be the last external device in your SCSI chain.andP;  Only theLightningScan is externally terminated (the terminator is provided).andP;  Aninternal terminator can be a problem if you have an internal drive and otherexternal SCSI devices.andP;  Your local computer store or user group should beable to help you remove the terminator resistors from the SCSIinterface boxif you don't feel comfortable doing this yourself.andP;  SCSI ID is easy to selectwith the same type of selector switches you find on external hard-diskdrives.andM;The Sky is Not the LimitandM;Given the low price, you expect to sacrifice something, and indeed allhand-held scanners have certain limitations when compared with their moreexpensive flatbed cousins.andM;One of the biggest drawbacks of hand-held scanners - their small size - isalso a feature.andP;  The three black-and-white scanners we tested have a maximumscan width of 4.1 inches, but this is changing (see the &quot;On the Horizon&quot;sidebar).andP;  The NCL color scanner covers a maximum width of only 2.5 inches.andO;Therefore, to scan large pictures, you need to scan multiple strips,assembling them with a painting or drawing program or with software thatcomes with the scanner.andP;  Unfortunately, this isn't as easy as it sounds.andM;The problem is that when you scan several adjacent strips for later assembly,you must be excruciatingly careful to scan parallel strips.andP;  Additionally,any slip of the scanner roller (which tells the software how far you'vescanned) results in strips of different lengths.andP;  Another problem occurs ifyou scan in a slightly curved path, which adds further distortions to thescanned image.andP;  Needless to say, many artistic effects are possible if youroll these scanners in otherthan-straight paths or even backward! SolutionsandM;Fortunately, some hand-held scanner manufacturers are addressing the problemof matching scan strips.andP;  Figure 1: The three hand-held black-and-whitescanners could resolve 8 line pairs per millimeter of our test strip; the NCLClearScan resolved only 1.8 line pairs per millimeter.andP;  By comparison, thehuman eye can resolve about 6 line pairs per millimeter from a foot away.andO;Thunderware's LightningScan, for instance, does a good job of dealing withit.andP;  To combat the curving problem, a plastic SnapGuide that attaches to thescanner allows scanning along a straightedge, thus ensuring a straight scan.andM;The LightningScan comes with software called ThunderWorks, which does thebest job of any of the programs that accompany these scanners in combattingnonparallel scans and distortion due to stretching.andP;  It allows the  joining&quot;of two scans into a single picture and is superior to a paint program forthis purpose, mainly because of two tools: the Push-Pin and the Skoogie.andP;  Youfirst import previously scanned left- and righthand images.andP;  With the Skoogietool, you align the tops of the images and &quot;pin&quot; them with a pushpin.andP;  Movingto the bottom of the image, you use the Skoogie tool to stretch and rotatethe right-hand image around the top pushpin until it is aligned.andP;  Anotherpushpin is placed at the bottom, and the Skoogie tool can now be used tostretch and bend the center of the images until they match.andP;  You can continueto Skoogie and place pins to your heart's content.andP;  Hats off to Thunderwarefor this gem !andP;  NCL's ClearScan software also joins multiple scans, but itdoesn't compensate for distortion.andP;  The Gather function lets you use themouse to match up two or three scans (up to 7 inches wide in all),overlapping the Figure 2: A straight line indicates an even spread of grayvalues.andP;  The hand-held blackand-white scanners, which all use similar scanheads, yielded plots like the one shown, which is fairly linear.andP;  The plotfor the NCL ClearScan is stepped.andP;  Each step shows that the color scannerinterprets a range of grays as a single gray.andP;  area common to the scans.andO;ClearScan has some other nice features.andP;  The Create Image commandautomatically creates an alterable color palette.andP;  There are also filters,which can be used to create certain special effects.andM;ThunderWorks has similar features for gray scale that can blur, sharpen, findedges, diffuse, lighten, darken, despeckle, smooth, and add relief.andP;  You canalso bring up a histogram of the grays in the image, a feature that can helpdetermine how to manipulate what you see.andM;Thunderware, Logitech, and Complete PC provide facilities for 32level (5-bit)gray-scale conversion, brightness and contrast manipulation, and rudimentarypaintlike touch-up tools.andP;  Complete PC added gray scale to its software,SmartScan, only after our testing was finished.) The touchup tools work intrue gray scale in all programs.andM;The Logitech ScanMan software also has its share of new features.andP;  One niftyone is the ability to scan a graphic from top to bottom, from left to right,or from right to left.andP;  You can achieve the same results with ThunderWorks byrotating the image after it's been scanned, but Logitech is to be commendedfor thinking of this time-saving feature.andP;  The ScanMan and the Complete PCCHPS require a scanner driver to be placed in the System Folder.andM;Despite the nice features, some of this software is not very intuitive andcan be downright frustrating.andP;  There is a confusing lack of consistency inthat of the Thunderware LightningScan and Logitech ScanMan, the only twoscanners to come with DA versions of their scanning software.andP;  Certainfeatures appear in the DA version but not in the application, and vice versa.andM;To the TestandM;In addition to scanner features, the quality of the art the scanners produceis an important consideration.andP;  We tested each scanner for resolution,gray-scale range, linearity (evenness of response to the range of grays), andimage quality (halftone and line art).andP;  All scanners showed a high level ofconsistency between successive scans.andM;To test resolution, we scanned the Image System Test Chart published by theU.S.andP;  Department of Commerce Patent and Trademark Office (see Figure 1).andO;This chart has sets of black and white line pairs of varying fineness, from Ipair per millimeter to 18 pairs per millimeter.andP;  (The human eye can resolveabout 6 line pairs per millimeter, held one foot away.) The black-and-whitescanners all resolved 8 line pairs per millimeter.andP;  The NCL ClearScanresolved 1.8 lines per millimeter, because of the lower-resolution RGB triadsof its color-detector arrays.andP;  Note that the black-and-white scanners, ataround $500, yielded the same result as the $29,000 Varityper 1200flatbedscanner (which includes a Mac IIcx), reviewed in the Desktop Scanners&quot; reportin this issue.andM;We tested the linearity and grayscale range of three of the scanners byscanning a Kodak SR-37 test strip.andP;  (The CHPS is black-and-white only anddoes not interpolate gray scale.) The SR-37 contains 37 gray blocks, startingat white, that get progressively darker by 12 percent per block.andP;  The stripwas scanned, and the resulting file was analyzed in Photoshop.andP;  The resultsare plotted in Figure 2.andP;  We plotted one curve for the ScanMan and one forthe NCL ColorScan.andP;  (The LightningScan's results were nearly identical tothose of the ScanMan.) The results of the NCL scanner were not nearly aslinear as those of the black-and-white scanners.andP;  Instead, the curve wasstepped, which shows that the NCL condensed a group of gray values into asingle value.andM;To test image quality, we scanned a piece of line art and a continuoustonephoto.andP;  The results were judged subjectively by the staff of MacUser Labs andthe author.andP;  The CHPS, LightningScan, and ScanMan all performed excellentlyon the line art, with printouts proving almost indistinguishable from theoriginals except for a little fill-in in high-density areas.andP;  This testyielded unacceptable results from the NCL ClearScan.andM;For producing a dithered image from a photograph, the LightningScan came outon top, followed closely by the CHPS.andP;  The ScanMan was next, and the NCLClearScan color scanner produced the worst quality.andP;  Surprisingly, the NCLcolor scanner produced the best black-and-white output on the LaserWriterfrom its lower-resolution scans.andP;  This brings up an important point: Theresolution and dither chosen for scanning must match (or be a multiple of)the resolution of the output device, or the results may be disappointing.andO;Don't scan at 400 dpi if you're outputting to a 72-dpi ImageWriter !andP;  For OCRwork, the black-andwhite scanners provided excellent results as long as wewere careful to set the scanners' brightness knobs properly.andP;  The color NCLClearScan didn't work well for OCR at all - we wouldn't recommend a colorscanner for this purpose.andM;SummaryandM;As you can tell, we were much more impressed with the monochrome scannersthan we were with the color one.andP;  But although we may seem guilty ofcolor-scanner bashing, we aren't forgetting that using a color hand-heldscanner is the only way to scan color into your computer for less than $700.andO;A color scanner is also the only device that can directly scan in true grayscale: The monochrome scanners scan in 1-bit and interpolate gray scale.andP;  Butthis is one technology that is rapidly changing, and you can expect greatimprovements in both areas over the next year.andM;If you own older versions of these scanners, don't despair.andP;  Thunderware willtake your old scanner, SCSIinterface box, and $189 and send you a newscanner, interface, and software.andP;  Complete PC offers a free upgrade to itsnew software.andP;  Logitech will send you its new scan head and software for just$125.andP;  No modification of your SCSI box is necessary, and you can keep theold scan head.andP;  Why you would need the old one is another story - one foreach hand, perhaps?

TABULAR DATA OMITTED HowIt Works: Hand-Held ScannersandM;All the compact hand-held devices we tested use built-in LED or fluorescentlight sources and CCD image detectors.andP;  You simply place them on the imageyou wish to scan, inform the software you'd like to bring in an image, andthen manually roll the scanner slowly across the original.andM;A rubber roller on the bottom of the scanner rotates as you draw it acrossthe image.andP;  Attached to this roller is a slotted wheel that interrupts alight beam and photocell in the scanner head, creating a series of electricalpulses that tell the computer how far you've rolled.andP;  This positionalinformation is combined with the light-intensity information from thephotodetector array to construct an image in your computer's memory (and thenon your screen for you to see).andM;You can then save the image in a variety of formats or use the traditionalMacintosh cut and paste methods to transfer the image to another application.andO;The scanner software that comes with every unit allows you to print the imageand perform some simple image manipulation.andM;Several innovative new scanners are coming that will soon shake up thehand-held-scanner market.andP;  We looked at prerelease versions of these scannersand advise scanner shoppers to keep them in mind.andM;The Mouse Systems PageBrush is both an optical mouse and a unique gray-scalehand-held scanner.andP;  The advantage here is that you can use the same device toclick on the buttons of your software that you use to do the scanning.andM;As with other optical mice, you use a grid underneath the mouse, which inthis case is clear plastic (there's no rolling ball).andP;  The mouse has twopositional sensors that let the computer determine the rotation of the mouseas well as its x, y position.andP;  You slip a photo (or line art) under the grid,and a contact-sensor array on the bottom of the mouse lets you &quot;paint&quot; theimage into your computer at 300 dpi with 6 bits (64 grays) per pixel.andM;A great advantage of the PageBrush is that you can go back over portions ofthe image you might have missed; as long as you don't pick the unit up offthe grid, it remembers where it's been.andP;  Thus, you can scan very largeimages, which eliminates the problem of assembling separate 4-inch-widescans.andP;  The scanned-image size is limited by your Mac's memory and the sizeof the grid you purchase from Mouse Systems  it will be available in avariety of sizes up to blueprint size).andP;  This is a truly revolutionary devicethat uses a sophisticated NuBus card for Mac IIs.andP;  it was expected to ship inAugust and to sell for around $799.andP;  Mouse Systems, 47505 Seabridge Drive,Fremont, CA, 94538; (415) 656-1117.andM;Another scanner that will cause a stir in the market is the Animus Color HandScanner.andP;  As with the color hand-held scanner we reviewed, the hardware is12-bit, but instead of limiting the number of colors to 256 (8 bits), thesoftware interpolates to 16.7 million colors (24 bits)! Another difference isthe scan width: almost 5 inches, twice that of the color hand-held scanner wereviewed.andP;  If that isn't tempting enough, it comes bundled with ColorScanMacCheese, a low-end but highly rated 24-bit paint program, and Read-it! OCRsoftware from Olduvai.andP;  The Animus Color Hand Scanner was expected to ship inAugust for a retail price of $599.andP;  if the shipping version works as well asthe beta we saw, it should be a hot item.andP;  Animus, 12675 Colony St., Chino,CA 91710; (714) 590-3940.andM;Marstek, a newcomer to the Macintosh market, will introduce threeblack-and-white scanners: the Mars 105, the Mars 128, and the Mars 800.andP;  Theblack-and-white software for the scanners is simplistic compared with thecurrent state of the art, but the hardware looks solid.andP;  The Mars 105 is ageneric scanner, with a 4-inch scan window and a 400-dpi sensor array.andP;  TheMars 128's scan head is 5 inches wide but has a lower-resolution, 200-dpi,array.andP;  The Mars 800 will have a 400-dpi array that will allow interpolationof a scanned image to 800 dpi.andP;  These scanners were expected to be releasedin the summer, but pricing was unavailable at press time.andP;  Marstek, Inc.,andO;17785-A Skypark Circle, Irvine, CA 92714; (714) 833-7740.andM;Another summer release was expected from Asuka, which is introducing threenew scanners.andP;  The Asuka NuScan Grayscale Scanner will offer 4-inch-wide400-dpi true-8-bit scanning (256 grays).andP;  It will sell for $599 with a SCSIinterface and $499 with a NuBus card.The NuScan Color is a 90-dpi-per-color,2.5-inch-wide color scanner that can scan up to 256 colors.andP;  It also comeswith a SCSI interface ($799) or a NuBus card ($649).andP;  The company is alsointroducing an interesting sheetfed scanner; the scan head of this unit canbe detached from the motorized paper feed to become an 8-inch-wide hand-heldscanner! The 8-inch scanner will sell for $799 with SCSI interface and $649with NuBus card.andM;Last, but certainly not least, NCL is adding to its ClearScan line.andP;  TheProfessional ($949) will have color and black-and-white heads in one unit,which NCL says will yield a sharper image for black-andwhite than a colorhead can give.andP;  The expected released date was this summer.andM;If you need a hand-held scanner to do a variety of jobs, we recommend theThunderware LightningScan ($495) as the best gray-scale package, combininggood hardware performance with the best software we looked at, ThunderWorks.andO;We were impressed by ThunderWorks' array of tools, especially the Skoogietool.andP;  (Keep in mind, though, that the Mouse Systems PageBrush will make theSkoogie unnecessary.) If you have more-sophisticated imageprocessing needs,there is always ImageStudio, Digital Darkroom, or Photoshop.andM;The NCL ClearScan ($695) is not as advanced as the black-and-white scanners;the scan width is much narrower, the software not as sophisticated, and theresolution nowhere near that of gray-scale hand-held scanners and colorflatbed scanners.andP;  It does an acceptable job at a low cost, however.andP;  Thesoftware is easy to use and includes some features that aid in the task ofdealing with color.andM;All this said, we highly recommend that you take a look at two of thescanners discussed in the &quot;On the Horizon&quot; sidebar, the Mouse SystemsPageBrush and the Animus Color HandyScan - it's safe to say that theyrepresent the next generation of hand-held scanners.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
