<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-63-0534 </DOCNO><TEXT>The three-dimensional Eulerian reactive hydrodynamic code 3DE has beenused to investigate the effects of particle size and the resulting voidor hole size on the shock initiation of heterogeneous explosive chargesof TNT. Shocks interacting with TNT containing various hole sizes havebeen modeled. The void fraction was held at 0.5% while the sphericalhole sizes were varied from 0.5- to 0.0005-mm radius, and the TNT wasshocked to 12.5 GPa. As the hole size was varied from 0.5 to 0.05 mm,the explosive became more sensitive to shock as the hole size decreased,and the number of hot spots increased. When the hole size was decreasedto 0.0005 mm, a 12.5-GPa shock wave failed to build toward propagatingdetonation because the resulting hot spots were cooled by side rarefactionsbefore appreciable decomposition occurred. At the same density, the mostshock-sensitive explosive will be that with particle sizes between coarseand extremely fine material. 11 refs., 6 figs., 2 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
