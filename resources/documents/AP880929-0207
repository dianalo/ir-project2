Gen. Henri Namphy.   It was one of the biggest outpourings seen in Port-au-Princesince dictator Jean-Claude Duvalier fled to France during a popularuprising in February 1986.   Most of the demonstrators appeared to be in their 20s. Theywaved banners and placards bearing such slogans as``Peasants-Workers-Army for Change,'' ``The Constitution Is OurWeapon,'' and ``Oust Macoutes from the Church.''   The Tonton Macoutes are former members of Duvalier's privatepolice force.   The demonstration, called off twice last week, was organized bysix civic action groups. One of them, the Confederation ofDemocratic Unity, a coalition advocating democratic reform, backedout of Thursday's events because of fears of a reprisal attack byTonton Macoutes who are being purged from the army.   Authorities arrested two men Wednesday and found submachine gunsand grenades in their luxury hotel room, local news reports said.   Dr. Louis Roy, who helped write the suspended 1987 constitution,said the demonstration went ahead despite rumors of a possibleattack because ``the popular pressure was so great. ... The peopleare no longer afraid.''   He said Haiti was ``ripe for democracy.''   Rank-and-file soldiers who overthrew Namphy and installed Lt.Gen. Prosper Avril as president under a new military governmentsaid they wanted to end random, state-sponsored violence andinstitute democratic reforms, including restoring the constitutionand elections for a civilian government.   Avril has named a predominantly civilian Cabinet and has pledgedto restore the constitution. On Wednesday he met with Haiti's mainopposition leaders. He has said his military government isprovisional, but has not set a date for elections. He says theyprobably will not be held for another two to 2{ years.   Thursday's demonstration began outside the charred ruins of theRoman Catholic St. Jean Bosco Church, where thugs wieldingmachetes, guns, clubs and spikes killed 13 people and wounded morethan 70 during a Mass on Sept. 11. Soldiers who overthrew Namphycited the massacre as a factor in triggering their revolt.   In the Dominican Republic, where Namphy and his wife anddaughter live in exile, Archbishop Nicolas de Jesus Lopez Rodriguezof Santo Domingo said Thursday he opposed granting Namphy politicalasylum or letting him stay there.   He told reporters after celebrating Mass, ``I think that thepresence of this gentleman is harmful. To grant him asylum just toget it over with would not be convenient either for the DominicanRepublic or Haiti, a people who want to get on the road to peace.''   The Dominican Republic shares the island of Hispaniola withHaiti.   Speculation rose that Namphy would be flying out of the countrysoon, but a Foreign Ministry spokesman said the government ``stillhas not made a decision about Namphy's situation.''</TEXT></DOC>
