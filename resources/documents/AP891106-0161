When President Daniel Ortega canceled a 19-month-old truce lastweek, he also proposed a meeting at U.N. headquarters. NadiaYounes, a U.N. spokeswoman, said the two sides had agreed to meetThursday and Friday.   Nicaragua's U.N. mission said Victor Hugo Tinoco, deputy foreignminister, probably would lead the government delegation.   A senior U.N. official said privately all issues will be on thetable, including the voluntary disbanding of the rebels, known asContras; security guarantees for those repatriated from rebel basesin neighboring Honduras and political reform in Nicaragua.   In Honduras, Contra military leader Enrique Bermudez told TheAssociated Press, ``We have accepted the new proposal for dialoguefrom Ortega,'' and said he would lead a five-man rebel delegation.   Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo, Roman Catholic primate ofNicaragua, has agreed to attend as an observer. He has been ago-between for the Sandinistas and Contras in the past.   Also present will be the International Commission forVerification and Support consisting of one official each from theUnited Nations and Organization of American States. The commissionwas established under the Central American peace plan of Aug. 7 tohelp the Contras disarm and resettle in Nicaragua with theirfamilies.   The Contras are expected to insist on resuming the cease-fire.They also want a general amnesty and guarantees that they can visitNicaragua to verify that reforms have been made and it is safe forthem to return.   The peace plan says the Contras must be disbanded by Dec. 5, butalso that their repatriation be voluntary.   So far, the rebels have shown no inclination to lay down theirweapons and return home, although some have gone back to Nicaraguawith their weapons.   Ortega said the infiltrating Contras had killed dozens of peopleand were trying to disrupt the campaign for national elections tobe held Feb. 25.   According to the State Department, about 2,000 Contras havereturned to Nicaragua from Honduras, making a total of 4,000 inNicaragua and about 10,000 remaining in Honduras.   Carlos Lopez Contreras, the Honduran foreign minister, saidFriday the rebels are ``a Nicaraguan problem'' and his governmentwill not participate in the meetings at U.N. headquarters.   The last direct talks between the Contras and Sandinistas, inJune 1988, failed when the government rejected Contra demands forreform that included an end to Sandinista control of the army andpolice.   In Managua on Monday, the Defense Ministry presented two menidentified as Contra commanders and 13 other rebels to journalistsand said they had accepted amnesty.   Orlando Barrera and Carlos Martinez, the commanders, said theywere ordered to tell people to vote for the United NicaraguanOpposition, the main opposition to the Sandinistas, in the Februaryelections.   ``We told people that if they didn't vote for UNO they wouldhave problems, and that meant we were going to kidnap themafterward,'' Barrera said. The opposition party denies links to theContras.   Santos Guzman, a 15-year-old rebel, said: ``We put down ourweapons because we had no ammunition, no food. We just walked, andwhen we encountered the army, we ran.''</TEXT></DOC>
