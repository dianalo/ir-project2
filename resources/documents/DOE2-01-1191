<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-01-1191 </DOCNO><TEXT>The response of an LMFBR roof cover to HCDA loadings is examined usinga combined 2D/3D modelling approach. A generic 3D roof design of box-typeconstruction is adopted and analysis under specimen loads carried outusing the finite element program ADINA. The reactor tank and all internalcomponents below roof level are assumed axisymmetric with the containmentcode SEURBNUK-EURDYN employed to follow the accident progression. Aninterface between SEURBNUK-EURDYN and ADINA is provided via a 2D simulantroof model, chosen to match the principal response characteristics ofthe 3D roof, to enable any interaction effects occurring during impactto be assessed.</TEXT></DOC>
