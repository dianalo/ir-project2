Oliver North&quot; (Viking, 374 pages, $22.95) to probethe mess.   Iran-Contra was the then 26-year-old Mr. Toobin's firstcase after he landed a job with special prosecutor LawrenceWalsh. Now, as he writes his first book, what he does best ofall is describe the background to an epic still unfolding.Mr. Walsh, writes Mr. Toobin, knew of the impediments tosuccessful prosecution before seeking indictments.</LP><TEXT>   Seasoned prosecutors on Mr. Walsh's staff wanted to homein on narrow charges such as lying to Congress, shreddingdocuments and buying lingerie with government funds. As theysaw it, North andamp; Co. had driven a truck through a loophole inthe Contra aid -- banning Boland Amendments, which weren'tcriminal statutes anyway. If you put them in the clink, sowent their argument, you may as well lock up all the taxlawyers.   But the team's zealous criminal defense lawyers divined anopaque &quot;criminal conspiracy&quot; in the wacky diversion of fundsfrom Iranian arms sales to the Nicaraguan Contras. Convincedthat he was &quot;right morally&quot; but would have a &quot;tough timelegally,&quot; Mr. Walsh threw jurisprudence to the wind and optedfor a show trial.   The brazen Mr. Walsh eschewed a requirement that heconsult with U.S. intelligence agencies before bringingsweeping charges that raised the prospect of a sweepingdefense based on classified documents. Then, to slip around abar on using the immunized testimony Mr. North had given toCongress -- which was fishing around to hook Ronald Reagan,but chickened out -- the prosecutors dreamed up a cockeyeddistinction between specific and general testimony that eventhey doubted would pass judicial muster.   Eventually, these whoppers caused his cases to implode,with Mr. Walsh doing his best to put the blame on thegovernment's putative obsession with secrecy. Mr. Toobinspoils Mr. Walsh's upright image, which is probably why Mr.Walsh tried to block publication of this book in court,insisting, with fine irony, that the proceedings of hisoffice should stay secret. Those proceedings reveal a manwho, at the risk of looking &quot;ridiculous,&quot; was &quot;willing toconsider any strategy, however novel, to keep the possibilityof winning alive.&quot;   Add hypersensitivity to Mr. Walsh's shortcomings. Afterall, the barbs in Mr. Toobin's narrative turn out to bedisappointingly few and far between. &quot;Opening Arguments&quot; isnot really a biting expose, but a heavy-hearted &quot;coming ofage&quot; story. A Harvard neophyte traverses the Beltway andlearns a thing or two about the limits of the legal systemand the tangled practice of foreign policy.   All too rarely does Mr. Toobin lift his eyes from hisstilted diary to ponder some of the bigger issues. Forinstance, he seems to have nothing to say on the matter ofthe special prosecutor law per se; we are left to makeinferences from the investigators' single-minded focus onpeople rather than on crime, and from Mr. Walsh's havingsurrounded himself with sycophantic former associates. Justwhy the Reagan administration helped bring the whole debacleon itself by consenting to an independent counsel in thefirst place -- thereby suggesting that crimes had beencommitted -- is another matter he leaves unexplored.   Still, anyone who has caused the high-WASP Mr. Walsh toblubber in public has performed an ample service. What's oddis that the press has generally chosen to ignore Mr. Toobin'sbrief against his onetime employer to focus on one twistedlittle chapter dealing with Costa Rica.   Mr. Toobin went there during the investigation to checkout what he deduced was a bribe given by the CentralIntelligence Agency in 1985 to then-President Luis AlbertoMonge in exchange for his facilitating the re-supply of theContras by their private benefactors. If so, the CIA was inviolation of the cursed Boland Amendments, a charge trumpetedin the Viking press release and in CIA-baiting news accounts.   Now, I'm privy to Mr. Toobin's classified source material,which documents payments to a nonprofit Costa Rican concernin a standard CIA operation unrelated to the Contras. On thestrength of no evidence save a cheap reference to Mr. Monge'squavering voice and moist brow during an interview, theauthor erroneously links the CIA payments to a re-supply dealbetween Mr. Monge and the U.S. ambassador, sans the CIA.   As anyone acquainted with the region would know, facedwith Sandinista border incursions, Mr. Monge was moved bydomestic pressures to aid the re-supply and thereby get theContras out of his country. There was no bribe or quid proquo. Historical context, alas, seems beyond Mr. Toobin'sreach. One hopes that, just to sell a few books, he has notpurposely maligned Mr. Monge, who did more than his part tobring democracy to Nicaragua.   ---   Mr. Brock is an Olin fellow at the Heritage Foundation.</TEXT></DOC>
