John Pendergrass, head of the department's Occupational Safety and Health Administration, said the fines proposed against Uretek Inc. of New Haven., Conn., are severe because the company refused to comply with procedures required to protect workers exposed to dimethylformamide, a chemical solvent that is a potent liver toxin.    The agency said the company failed to ensure the use of protective clothing by 34 employees, of a total of 65 workers who handle the chemical.    Company records in 1985 and 1986 showed six employees with liver abnormalities, and OSHA officials later found that 34 employees had been overexposed to the chemical. Uretek also was charged with permitting workers to store and to consume food and beverages in areas contaminated with the toxin. A spokesman for the company declined to comment.    OSHA said it conducted a comprehensive investigation at the New Haven facility after receiving a complaint that workers were being exposed to the toxin. Uretek has 15 working days to contest the citations and proposed penalties before the independent Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission. </TEXT></DOC>
