Judging by numbers, the Soviet space program had a stellar year. It launched 91 missions -- 88% of the world's total -- compared with six successful U.S. launches, said Nicholas L. Johnson, a scientist for Teledyne Brown Engineering. Mr. Johnson closely monitors Soviet space activities for his company, a National Aeronautics and Space Administration contractor, and publishes his analysis annually. He said that about two-thirds of the Soviet launches involved military missions, somewhat less than the U.S. Department of Defense has estimated.    Other specialists confirmed that the Soviets took a vast lead in space in 1986, a year in which U.S. progress was stifled by the Challenger disaster and the explosion of Delta and Titan rockets during launching.    The problems didn't end in 1986. Last week, an Atlas Centaur rocket with a Navy communications satellite aboard strayed off course and was destroyed after liftoff from Cape Canaveral.    James Oberg, a space engineer, estimated it will take five years for the U.S. space program to regain ground lost since 1985. In the meantime, he said, &quot;The Soviets aren't going to be standing still.&quot;    Coming advances in the Soviet program may include commercial launches of satellites for customers in the non-communist world, Mr. Johnson said. The Soviets' new willingness to disclose launch schedules and to reveal failures -- as well as the frequency of Soviet launchings -- have diminished mistrust among potential non-communist launch customers, he said.    Among notable examples of scientific progress last year -- including advances in photographic reconnaissance and ocean surveillance and a close encounter with Halley's Comet -- the Soviets passed some historic milestones in manned flight. The 125-day mission of a Soyuz spacecraft carried the total Soviet experience in space beyond the 100,000 man-hours mark. A Soviet commander became the first man to spend a full year in space, over several Soyuz missions. And two cosmonauts set records for the most time in space outside their spacecraft.    The greater performance of the Soviet over the U.S. programs last year, Mr. Johnson said, resulted partly from radically different approaches to space travel. The Soviets mass-produce rockets and satellites and they have shorter lifespans and limited versatility. The frequency of Soviet launchings not only lessens the trauma when a rocket misfires, but gives the Soviets a detailed performance history on their workhorse launch systems.    &quot;If there's a problem, they don't have to doubt the design,&quot; Mr. Johnson said. in an interview. &quot;They just say it was a bad day.&quot;    That means totally different response to failure. Under the most optimistic scenario, at least a year will lapse before the next U.S. space shuttle flight, after an exhaustive technical and bureaucratic examination. On the other hand, after the Soviets' worst disaster last year -- the loss of an early warning satellite stranded in a faulty orbit -- they launched again, successfully, 12 days after the accident.    Mr. Johnson predicted that in the 1990s, the Soviets will have a working shuttle system, similar to the American shuttle, while the U.S. space station program will have begun to narrow the Soviet's lead in long-duration space flight. &quot;In the 1990s, we'll come back together again,&quot; he said. &quot;We just diverted on how to get there.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
