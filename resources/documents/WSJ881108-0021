The supermarket chain said the preliminary accord was reached with attorneys for 11 of 14 shareholder plaintiffs. Under it, the company agreed to modify certain terms of the $17 principal amount of subordinated debentures issued as part of the restructuring package. The debentures are intended to have a trading value of about $8 a share.    Among other things, Kroger agreed to shorten the debentures' maturity date by two years, to Oct. 15, 2006. The settlement is subject to various conditions, including approval by the Hamilton County, Ohio, Court of Common Pleas, where the original six suits were filed. The court combined them into one class-action suit.    Separately, Kroger said it bought $134 million of its various notes, including $72.5 million of 8% notes due 1993, $6.5 million of two-year 7% notes and $55 million of medium-term notes. The company said it intends to deposit in trust collateral to secure payment, when they come due, of about $47 million of notes that remain outstanding. </TEXT></DOC>
