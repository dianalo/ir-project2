Bush said ``support of the First Amendment need not extend'' todesecration of the flag, which he termed ``the unique symbol ofAmerica.''   Bush fielded questions on subjects ranging from internationaldiplomacy to child care legislation to baseball in a free-wheeling45-minute news conference in the White House briefing room.   The president said:   _ He will carry a package of economic aid when he travels toPoland next month, but wants to first make sure that the communistgovernment there will follow through on economic and politicalreform. He said Soviet leaders shouldn't be ``uptight'' about hisjourney to Poland and Hungary.   _ He still favors U.S. contacts with China despite the continuingcrackdown in Beijing against pro-democracy leaders.   _ He has no plans to call for legislation to alter recent SupremeCourt rulings on affirmative action that drew criticism from civilrights groups.   _ He intends to make sure that any wrongdoing at the Departmentof Housing and Urban Development is thoroughly aired and remedied.   _ He criticized legislation passed by the Democratic-controlledSenate on child care, but said he hopes agreement can be worked outon the subject.   Bush opened his visit to the briefing room by declaring hissupport for a constitutional amendment that would negate last week's5-4 Supreme Court decision. The court held that burning the Americanflag as a form of protest is protected by the Constitution.   Bush said it was important to protect th free-speech guaranteesof protest, but he didn't want to extend that to the flag.   The court's decision provoked an emotional response in Congressand elsewhere, and Bush said protection of the flag will ``in no waylimit'' constitutional rights. He said he favored a constitutionalamendment over legislation because a law ``cannot correct, in myview, the egregious offense of burning the American flag.''   A constitutional amendment must be approved by a two-thirds voteof the House and Senate, and then ratified by 38 of the 50 states.The day after the Supreme Court ruling, proposed constitutionalamendments were introduced in both houses of Congress.   House Speaker Thomas Foley, D-Wash., reacted angrily today whenreporters suggested that Republicans could make flag burning apartisan issue if Democrats fail to support a constitutionalamendment to overturn the ruling.   ``I'm sure people will play politics with any emotional issue,''Foley said, calling such partisanship ``reprehensible anddisgusting.''   Foley expressed caution about a constitutional amendment.   ``I do not feel we should rush into an amendment to the FirstAmendment of the Constitution,'' he said.   Bush also he does not want to see contacts with the Chinesegovernment cut off, despite a continuing crackdown in Beijingagainst leaders of a pro-democracy movement.   ``I'm going to do my level best to find a way to see improvementthere that will help the Chinese people,'' he said. He said it wastoo bad the Chinese have decided against a visit by Peace Corpsvolunteers this fall.   ``I believe that it was contact with the United States and othersin the west that moved the process of economic reforms forward andhopefully someday will move the process of political reformforward.''   Bush said he does not expect his stops in Poland and Hungary nextmonth to be disruptive to the Communist world, and said he does notexpect Soviet leaders to be ``uptight'' abnout his presence inEastern Europe. He noted that Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachevrecently went to West Germany, and was very well received there.   ``I think it's important that the United States show its interestin these countries,'' he said of the two Eastern European nationscurrently undergoing delicate transitions to greater politicalrights.   He also vowed his administration would get to the bottom ofscandals at the Department of Housing and Urban Development. ``Weare going to do everything we can to clean up any cronyism and seethat matters of that nature do not recur,'' he said.   Bush said he would not try to assign blame for the problems atHUD.   ``Something might be happening in some department today that Iknow nothing about. We've got an enormous bureaucracy. We've got atremendous bureaucracy that extends all around the world and theremight be some corruption going,'' he said.   Bush said he had confidence in HUD Secretary Jack Kemp, who alsohas vowed to clean up his department. Investigators are looking intoalleged irregularities in housing programs in several states, andcongressional committess also are probing the operation of thedepartment under Samuel Pierce, who served as secretary for eightyears under President Reagan.   Bush also said his advisers have concluded that none of therecent Sypreme Court rulings on affirmative action has jeopardizedthe principles of equal opportunity for all Americans. The court hasmade several rulings in recent weeks that civil rights advocates sayundercut progress made toward equal rights, and have said theyintend to ask Congress to write new protections into law.   Bush said if the court's decisions turn out to hamper civilrightrs enforcement, he would consider legislation.   But he had no such reluctance on the volatile flag desecrationissue, which the court addressed last week.   ``I believe the importance of this issue compels me to call for aconstitutional amendment. Support for the Constitution need notextend to the desecration of the American flag,'' he said.   ``I do feel viscerally about burning the American flag,'' he said.   Bush also used his question-and-answer session before White Housereporters to renew his opposition to abortion. The Court is expectedto issue a ruling later this week on a case involving abortion.   Bush, an avid baseball fan, declined to answer a question onwhether Cincinnati Reds manager Pete Rose is being treated fairly byan investigation into his alleged gambling on baseball games.</TEXT></DOC>
