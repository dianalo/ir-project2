And thatyou can pretty much use as much water as you desire becausethere's so much of it and it's so cheap, almost free. Noteveryone believes that now in California, which is in thefourth year of a severe drought.   Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley recently announced awater-rationing program. Some of it resembles the crisisconservation program New York City and other Northeasterntowns tried a few years ago during a long drought. Maybethere's a better way to manage &quot;public&quot; water, so that hugepopulations of people don't suddenly wake up to discover thatthey and their wasteful ways have caused a &quot;crisis.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   These problems recur in large part because publicauthorities tend to think that water mixes with marketsetprices about as well as it does with oil. Water is handed outlike, well, as the saying goes, &quot;like it was water.&quot; Hiddensubsidies to many of the nation's big users of water actuallydistort the market for this commodity. John Boland, a JohnsHopkins University professor recognized for work in watereconomics, observes, &quot;We persist in selling water for lessthan it costs.&quot; No wonder we're so frequently left high anddry.   After years of bitter fights over water resources, thepolitical system is beginning to find its way toward arational solution. (There are still places, such as SantaMonica, Calif., that create fines for people who fail toinsert flow restricters in their homes.) Most places arediscovering that the price mechanism does a better job ofdiscouraging profligate consumption.   Even so, the pop environmental movement continues totarget the water villain who &quot;wastes&quot; water. People are madeto feel that they are committing a crime against societybecause they &quot;waste&quot; resources, such as gasoline orelectricity or even landfill space.   The local water authorities' first line of attack againstthese &quot;cheaters&quot; is often a use surcharge, imposed above somehistorical base. Of course, some public authority decideswhat's wasting and what isn't. Ultimately, the wasters aretracked down by inspectors and perhaps ticketed, as is nowdone in Santa Barbara and elsewhere. But then because ahard-and-fast cutoff would impose hardships on users withchanged circumstances, such as a growing business, theauthorities typically offer exemptions that are alsoarbitrary.   This is a silly routine, especially when used by a placesuch as New York City, which hadn't even bothered to meterfor water previously. Why not try to balance supply anddemand for such a widely used resource by relying onmarket-driven changes in its price? Consider gasoline. Duringthe energy &quot;crisis&quot; people idled in gas lines. Now gasshortages are unheard of. That's because the decontrol ofenergy prices made life normal again at the gasoline pump.   Admittedly, this analogy isn't perfect. A tough barrier,according to Johns Hopkins' Mr. Boland, is that even withhonest prices, people living through a drought may changehabits slowly. Unlike gasoline, water is billed well afterit's been used, so the eventual cost may not be associatedwith outrageous excesses. Most adjustments take longer -- ayear or so to change landscaping practices, longer to replaceappliances. By then the drought condition may have ended oreased, and the old wasteful system trickles back into place(though there are indications that a permanent &quot;life stylechange&quot; is coming to Southern California).   Also, because water isn't close to being a competitiveindustry, it's hard to arrive at the proper clearing pricefor water. If drought brings higher prices, the extra revenuemay in the end only expand the bureaucracy, which tends tofind &quot;other&quot; things to do when given more money.   Other utilities such as natural gas or electricity sharesome of these problems, but many are shareholder-owned andwork fairly well if exposed to market forces. Maggie Thatcheris moving in the proper direction by trying to privatizewater service.   In the meantime, water sales between jurisdictions are oneimportant step. Sales from the Imperial Valley farm region ofCalifornia to urban users are a model.   Perestroika has its place even in America. Resources, suchas water, are often an unpriced wilderness. Environmentaliststoo often try to preserve these resources by simplydiscouraging their use. A better way might be to recognizethat ownership and pricing serve to protect and conserve.What better place for the U.S. to start tapping intocapitalism's proven success again than in the allocation ofwater? Droughts may recur but there's little reason why amood of public panic and crisis policies must inevitablyfollow.</TEXT></DOC>
