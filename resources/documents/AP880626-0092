What's more, ladies andgentlemen, everybody can be a winner.   A too-good-to-be-true offer? No. A gimmick? Yes.   The promotion is brought to you by the friendly folks of Rolfe,Iowa, who hope their slick campaign will entice people to move to atiny town itching to get bigger.   Rolfe, which will provide $1,200, a free lot and recreation forfolks who build and live in a house worth at least $30,000, isamong a growing number of towns in rural America offeringincentives to lure new residents or industry.   All across the heartland, small towns that have lost people,jobs and schools to the farm crisis are now waging aggressivecampaigns in their struggle to expand or at least stay alive.   ``Rural communities are fighting for survival,'' said PaulLasley, an Iowa State University sociologist. ``It's a verycompetitive situation we've got out there.''   Some towns make pitches in radio or newspaper ads. Many havehired professionals. All are humming a tune of promises, promises,promises _ low business rents, free buildings, tax breaks, cheaputilities and, in some cases, hard cash.   Some towns are angling for jobs. Others want people. Both areimportant.   ``It's kind of a chicken and egg question _ do jobs attractpeople or do people attract employers who bring jobs?'' Lasleysaid. ``It's some of both.''   The increasing number of towns offering incentives, he added,``reflects the desperate financial situation in rural America.''   Not all the towns have been ravaged by hard times, but many haveseen neighboring communities wither away. They fear unless theymove fast, they'll be next. Strategies vary:   _In Chetek, Wis., population 2,160, a bank is offering a $5,000reward this year to anyone who can bring in a new business thatwill employ at least 15 people full time.   ``We're a small town. We're looking for any small employer.We're not trying to recruit a Saturn (auto) plant,'' said RobertMissling, president of the Chetek State Bank, which is offering thereward.   _In Rolfe, Iowa, the incentives include cash, one-year familymembership to the pool and golf course and 8.8 percent initialfinancing.   ``We feel like we have just about everything we need _ exceptpeople,'' said Bill Winkleblack, president of the Rolfe BettermentCorp. One couple has taken advantage of the offer and a house isunder construction, he said.   _In Osakis, Minn., up to $5,000 is offered toward the cost of alot and home for anyone willing to build and stay five years. Asimilar offer is available to businesses. The program is financedwith proceeds from the ``pull tab,'' a local instant lottery.   ``We don't want to lose what we've got,'' said Tom Ellis, amember of the Osakis Economic Development Corp. ``It's sort of acircle-your-wagon defense.''   One couple recently took advantage of the program and built ahome in town, Ellis said. Officials said since the incentive wasannounced last fall, about 25 inquiries had come in from as faraway as California and Florida.   _In Mexico, Mo., prospective businesses are being tempted withoffers of free land and cheaper rents. The town will also offercash to a company based on the number and skill level of the jobsit brings to town, as long as the company stays 10 years.   In the last two years, five manufacturers that will eventuallyemploy up to 630 people have moved to Mexico, said JerrySchmutzler, city director of economic development. Another companythat will provide 200 new jobs will open in July, he said, andplans in the works could bring 300 more jobs to town by 1990.   Schmutzler said special offers are important only after acompany has narrowed down possible locations to a few towns. Then,he said, ``it's who wants (the company) the most. It's who'soffering the biggest incentives.''   Scores of other rural towns have similar programs, leading someexperts to question whether they are giving away the store.   ``They feel like they don't have a chance unless they sell theirsoul,'' said Rex Campbell, a University of Missouri sociologist.``They have to offer not just a building, but a building with freetaxes.   ``Competition is so tough,'' he said, ``if you go 10 miles or100 miles down the road, there's going to be some other communitythat's willing to provide (a company) with free everything. Unlessyou offer free everything, you'll lose them.''   The drawback, he said, is ``there's only so many marbles tospread around. There's only so many plants looking for a site.''   And that can pit towns against each other.   ``In some ways, it's a zero-sum game,'' said Lasley of IowaState. ``One community gains at the expense of another.''   But town officials say they carefully analyze the cost-benefitratio before offering special deals.   In Rolfe, for example, ``we need new housing,'' said DavidJochims, city administrator. ``It commits people to our community.... We get a payback. We get tax dollars and utility dollars.''   The town of 700 has lost about 10 percent of its populationsince 1980, officials say, and the last new house was built sevenyears ago.   ``We need to offer jobs and housing ... to ensure we're going tobe here in the future,'' Jochims added. Iowa, federal statisticsshow, lost 62,000 people from 1980 to 1986.   In recruiting, many communities emphasize the Norman Rockwellaspect of small-town U.S.A., such as low taxes, good schools,little crime. But often, there's one missing piece in the puzzle _jobs.   And no matter what they offer, experts say, remotely locatedtowns aren't likely to attract industry, and without work, there'slittle reason for people to relocate.   While many say it's too early to judge the impact of incentives,Bettendorf, Iowa, offers an example of where they worked _ too well.   Last year, Bettendorf had to end its offer to pay up to $500 offirst-time homebuyers' closing costs when it ran out of money, saidDick Kvach, planning coordinator. The program's cost: $106,000.   ``The response was much greater than anticipated,'' Kvach said,and 280 homes were bought and built in 10 months, with about 20percent of the buyers coming from out of state.   Money aside, Campbell said incentives also had intangible value.   ``It makes a community feel better,'' he said. ``They're tryingto control their own destiny. ... In a few cases, it may succeed.''   But, he added, ``for the great many, my answer would be no.''</TEXT><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE><TEXT>   Sharon Cohen is the AP Midwest regionalreporter, based in Chicago.</TEXT></DOC>
