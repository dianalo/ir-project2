At a news conference on Wednesday, Bentsen looked relaxed andcomfortable in his day-old role as Dukakis' running mate. With theMassachusetts governor at his side, Bentsen minimized hisdifferences with Dukakis on such issues as abortion funding, Contraaid, and the Reagan tax cuts.   On ``the vast majority'' of issues, from jobs to health care toeducation, ``we share a common cause,'' the Texas senator said.   On Wednesday, Bentsen skipped a Finance Committee meeting tomake the political rounds with Dukakis. Today, though, he waspresiding as committee chairman at a hearing on the U.S.-Canadafree trade agreement.   Bentsen won a warm bipartisan tribute from his Senate colleaguesWednesday night. As he entered the chamber for a roll call,Republican leader Bob Dole of Kansas spotted him and said: ``I'dlike to extend my congratulations to Sen. Bentsen, from this sideof the aisle.''   The senators present, Republicans and Democrats alike, rose totheir feet and burst into applause. Bentsen grinned and waved.   Bentsen was asked Wednesday at his Capitol Hill news conferencewith Dukakis about his plans to run for re-election to his Senateseat as well as the vice presidency in November.   ``I can't get off the ticket in Texas. That's the way the law iswritten,'' he said. ``If I was to step off the ticket, that wouldforfeit it to the Republican challenger, and I can't do that.''   At the news conference, Bentsen laughed off a question aboutwhether his age _ 67 _ was ``prohibitive,'' and challenged hisquestioner, Sam Donaldson of ABC, to a tennis match.   Bentsen said his 94-year-old father ``goes to work every morningby 6 o'clock, works six days a week, drives his own car and has afuzzbuster on the dash.'' He hastened to add that in Texas, suchradar-detection devices are legal.   Earlier, Bentsen got a chilly reception at the NAACP convention,where some delegates booed when Dukakis introduced the running matehe choose over Jesse Jackson. NAACP executive director Benjamin L.Hooks intervened to cajole the delegates into offering Bentsen awarmer hand.   Bentsen told the NAACP that, ``For all who are commited tojustice and equality, indifference is simply not an option in 1988.   ``If you care about the make-up of the Civil Rights Commission... or the composition of the Supreme Court or ther leadership ofthe Justice Department, or about equality and progress in jobs andschools, I think you have to vote for Michael Dukakis,'' saidBentsen.   ``It's important not just for the NAACP, not just for blackAmericans, but for all who care about freedom and opportunity, forall who believe that government can be a force for fairness, forall who believe in the politics of inclusion,'' he said.   ``Mike Dukakis and I are committed to making a difference forAmerica ... and we need your help,'' said Bentsen.   Bentsen said he talked by telephone with Jackson earlierWednesday.   ``Jesse Jackson is a friend of mine, he's a very able gentleman,and I wanted to establish communications with him. And that I did,and I think we had a very good conversation,'' he said.   Bentsen once expressed puzzlement that Lyndon Johnson waswilling to give up his powerful Senate post to become vicepresident. Asked why, in light of that, he accepted Dukakis' offer,Bentsen said he was ``convinced that I could be a trusted adviserto the next president of the United States, and that's one of themajor responsibilities that a public official can fill.''   Bentsen and Dukakis were traveling to Texas for a rally togetheron Sunday, the day before the opening of the Democratic NationalConvention.</TEXT></DOC>
