Gardner announced Thursday he will resign as president ofthe prestigious University of California system because he no longer has hiswife, Libby, by his side.;   During a news conference packed with surprisedand solemn university officials, Gardner delivered a poignant tribute to hiswife of 33 years, who died of heart failure in February at age 55. Hecharacterized her as his best friend, sounding board and an indispensablepartner in running the nine campuses.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Front  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  GRIEVING UC LEADER TO STEP DOWNHE SAYS HE CAN'T GO ON WITHOUT WIFE-COLLEAGUE  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Mercury News Staff Writer Dennis Akizuki contributed to this report.  </MEMO><TEXT>     &quot;If I came into the job single or if Libby had a separate career, thatmight be different,&quot; the 58-year-old Gardner said, struggling to keep a steadyvoice. &quot;But Libby and I took this position together. We came into the jobmarried. What we did together I am now doing alone, and it is not the same.&quot;;  The loss of Gardner -- widely admired as a brilliant budget strategist whohas guided UC with a steady hand through a period of staggering growth -- willcome at a difficult time for the overburdened system.;   With enrollment at anall-time high, UC last year was forced to cut $295 million out of its $2.2billion budget and lay off staff members. More reductions are anticipated nextyear.;   But Gardner, who has served for eight years, won't leave his$243,500-a-year post until Oct. 1, 1992. He wanted to allow himself time toput together a budget for fiscal 1993 and give the university time to find asuccessor.;   Gardner gave his resignation letter to UC Board of RegentsPresident Meredith Khachigian Wednesday night and announced it officially tothe board on Thursday.;   &quot;I read the letter, and I couldn't believe it,&quot;Khachigian said. &quot;It was a dramatic moment. It was not something I ever wantedto see. But I could see he hasn't been the same since Libby died. The lighthad gone out of his eyes.&quot;;   Gardner and his wife had four children, all ofwhom attended UC. Two of them, Shari Olmstead, 29, and Marci Gardner, 22,watched quietly as their father made his announcement. Afterward, theyembraced and kissed him, then escorted him through the crowd of reporters.;  Gardner suggested Thursday he may become a bigger champion for the universityonce he steps down. Showing signs of frustration with state leaders, hecomplained that the California higher education master plan calls on UC toeducate the top 12.5 percent of high school graduates but the Legislatureprovides too little funding to do the job.;   &quot;In many respects, I can dobetter without the personal repercussions that my comments might have,&quot; hesaid. &quot;I can be more open the last year of my service when people know I amstepping down than I can now. And when I leave, I can do whatever I want.&quot;;  State and university officials praised Gardner as an astute manager whorescued the UC system from low morale when he took over in 1983. At the time,faculty salaries lagged behind those at comparable universities, and theuniversity only attracted 72 percent of its first-choice candidates.;  Gardner persuaded then-Gov. George Deukmejian to give the system $150 millionin 1984, and the resulting faculty salary increases helped raise UC'sstature.;   &quot;I will miss him greatly, and the state will miss him,&quot; saidChancellor Barry Munitz, Gardner's counterpart in the California StateUniversity system. &quot;I would say he is the intellectual leader of the state. Myfervent hope is that he will take the next year and work to improve the(funding) situation for public universities.&quot;;   Gardner is credited withseveral accomplishments: UC has undertaken more construction projects thanever before under his administration, with $3.7 billion worth of projectsbegun since 1983. Enrollment has increased from 141,000 to about 166,000.Gifts and endowments to UC have risen from $157.5 million when he took the jobto $414.7 million last year.;   He was instrumental in developing aUniversitywide Humanities Institute at UC-Irvine and 43 additional centers forstudy abroad. He also forged a partnership to construct the world's largestoptical telescope atop Mauna Kea in Hawaii.;   But his administration has seenits share of controversies. In the mid-1980s, moving against a tide of publicopinion, Gardner opposed a regents' decision to withdraw investments fromcompanies doing business in South Africa. He believed UC should not be avehicle for political statements.;   Gardner also has defended UC's managementof the U.S. Department of Energy laboratories at Livermore and Los Alamos --where nuclear weapons are designed -- as providing a public service.;   Lastspring he came under fire when he proposed, and the regents accepted, a 40percent increase in student fees this year.;   And his resignationannouncement Thursday came on the heels of a regents' discussion of aninternal audit that found UC had billed the federal government for suchquestionable expenses as executive air travel, gifts of flowers andentertainment.;   Nevertheless, Gardner said it was his wife's death -- notthe job's pressures -- that led to his decision.;   &quot;These positions tend tobe a bit isolating,&quot; Gardner said. &quot;You make a lot of acquaintances, but notmany friends. She was the one I could count on to give me ideas and give meadvice on when my ideas were deserving of consideration.&quot;;   In his letter ofresignation, he described the joy of working with his wife.;   &quot;It was apartnership that brought immense personal pleasure, challenge, accomplishmentand satisfaction,&quot; he wrote. &quot;Death has now dissolved our partnership, atleast for this life, although according to our faith not forever, and it hasbecome clearer with each passing month since Libby's death that without her Icannot remain as president of the University of California.&quot;;   Married inJune 1958, Gardner and his wife were Mormons, whose belief is that marriagelasts beyond death.;   Friends said Libby Gardner was constantly at herhusband's side during his administration. She hosted parties, greeteddignitaries, served as unofficial chief of protocol and learned in detailabout issues concerning the university.;   &quot;They found the kind of pleasure ofworking together and solving things together that normal people just don'tdiscover,&quot; said Tom Harris, who was Gardner's roommate at Brigham YoungUniversity in Utah.;   &quot;I'm saddened by (his resignation), because I'm deeplyhurt he's suffering like that. Dave never gives up. It just indicates thelevel of anxiety he's going through.&quot;  </TEXT><BYLINE>  RENEE KOURY, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   911115  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Friday  </DAY><MONTH>  November  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  1,134  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Friday, November 15, 199100320206,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  0  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENGFRONT  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
