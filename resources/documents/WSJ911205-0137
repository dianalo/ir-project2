Keating Jr., the former thriftoperator who has come to symbolize for many the savings andloan crisis of the 1980s, was convicted by a California statejury on all but one of 18 state securities-fraud charges.   The one-time chairman of American Continental Corp., whoturned 68 years old yesterday, grimly faced Judge Lance A.Ito as the verdicts were read. In about 15 minutes ofreciting their findings, jurors accepted nearly the entirepicture prosecutors had painted of an executive with intimateknowledge -- if not direct control -- of American Continentalbond-sales operations at branches of the Phoenix, Ariz.,company's former Lincoln Savings andamp; Loan unit.</LP><TEXT>   The criminal trial of Mr. Keating involved some emotionalissues. He was charged with making false statements andomitting material information about the safety of $250million of subordinated debentures that were purchased bymore than 17,000 investors, many of them retirees whoinvested part of their life savings. The debentures becamenearly worthless after American Continental sought Chapter 11bankruptcy-law protection in April 1989.   But the issues in the trial actually were fairly narrowwhen compared to other events surrounding the estimated $2.6billion failure of Lincoln.   In the freewheeling thrift management style of themid-1980s, the former land developer's company acquiredLincoln in 1984 and quickly stuffed its portfolio with junkbonds and other risky investments. When regulators questionedsome of these practices, Mr. Keating became their loudestcritic and attempted to curry favor with politicalcontributions to members of Congress, including the so-calledKeating Five senators.   He is also the target of a wide-ranging federalinvestigation into his business dealings at the companies.The probe is said to concern allegedly phony land swaps andother apparent bank fraud aimed at showing paper earnings atthe thrift and generating fat profits for the principals.   In the California securities fraud case, the only criminalproceeding so far against Mr. Keating, prosecutors faced achallenge. The law here, as in most states, allows a topexecutive to be held criminally accountable only for wrongfulacts by subordinates that he knew about, intended, and aided.   Thus the Los Angeles prosecutors, lacking direct proofthat Mr. Keating personally controlled the sales in question,tried during 10 weeks of witness testimony to forge a chainof circumstantial evidence linking him to the transactions.   Mr. Keating's attorney, Stephen C. Neal, tried to breakthat chain in several ways. He argued that Mr. Keating didn'tknow about any unlawful acts because his employees neverreported them to him, and that he couldn't have intended anywrongdoing because he relied on the advice of lawyers andaccountants.   Los Angeles County District Attorney Ira Reiner heraldedthe verdict. &quot;The lesson for the Keatings of this world tolearn is that you don't have to be at the scene of the crimeto go to prison,&quot; he said. &quot;We've heard arguments that youcouldn't make a connection between misrepresentations made bybond sellers on the sales floor and Keating, who was,figuratively speaking, light-years removed. Well, you canmake that case.&quot;   He said prosecutors developed &quot;a complete mosaic, piece bypiece, and when it's complete, there's Keating in thepicture.&quot;   Guilty verdicts on only six counts were required before asentence of the maximum of 10 years in prison was possible.Judge Ito set a date in Februrary for considering motions andsentencing matters.   Mr. Neal said that &quot;there will definitely be an appeal.&quot;The attorney had rested the defense case without calling anydefense witnesses, repeatedly telling the jury in his closingarguments that there wasn't &quot;a shred of evidence&quot; linking hisclient to any deceptive sales tactics. Mr. Keating himselfyesterday spoke quietly with his family after the verdict,saying to reporters only: &quot;I agree with my counsel.&quot;   The Keating defense had countered the prosecution's casewith an argument that sales pitches for the bonds conformedto regulators' requirements, and that salespeople wereinstructed to provide accompanying prospectuses disclosingthe company's financial condition. Further, Mr. Keating'sattorney argued that the executive relied on advisers forwhat decisions he did make.   But jury foreman David Murphy, a 21-year-old pharmacytechnician, said after the trial that while the 12 jurorshadn't seen evidence of a direct link between Mr. Keating andthe unlawful sales practices, &quot;he knew of it and did nothingto stop it. The guidelines and sales techniques neverchanged.&quot;   As for the issue of Mr. Keating's dependence on advisers,Mr. Murphy said: &quot;It's like that {joke}, how many lawyersdoes it take to hide behind? That defense got old. He hadsuch a hands-on approach that his lawyers did his bidding,basically.&quot;   The 53 prosecution witnesses during the trial includedbuyers and sellers of the bonds, regulators, formerassociates of Mr. Keating, and financial experts.   Lincoln's former president, Raymond Fidel, who had pleadedguilty to securities fraud and was cooperating withprosecutors, said that even after American Continentalreported a $36 million third-quarter loss in 1988, Mr.Keating didn't alter the upbeat sales pitch drafted duringthe sunnier days of 1986. &quot;The company's inherent riskchanged, but we did not change that verbal presentation,&quot; Mr.Fidel testified.   &quot;Where there was good news . . . Keating would cause thatinformation to be put down the pipeline to his bondsalesmen,&quot; but bad news didn't get through, Deputy DistrictAttorney William Hodgman told the jury in summing up Mr.Fidel's statements. On cross-examination, Mr. Fidel concededthat the procedures weren't always followed, but said henever told Mr. Keating of that.   Another witness, former Lincoln Chairman Robin Symes,testified that examiners had concluded by 1987 that thethrift -- American Continental's principal asset -- was introuble, but Mr. Keating never told him to pass thatinformation on to bond purchasers. Indeed, negative reportsabout the company were always followed by meetings duringwhich salespeople were assured of its stability, according toone salesman's testimony.   Some harmful statements were attributed to Mr. Keatinghimself. One time, apparently feeling bridled by restrictionsplaced on the marketing of bonds, Mr. Keating was alleged bya former associate to have asked, &quot;Can we cheat?&quot;   The defense argued that such statements were off-the-cuffand shouldn't be taken seriously.   Bond sales were discontinued two months before AmericanContinental filed for bankruptcy-law protection, and thethrift was seized by regulators. Lincoln has since beenacquired by Great Western Financial Corp., Beverly Hills,Calif.   True to its venue, the trial often seemed to borrow pagesfrom scripts of &quot;L.A. Law.&quot; On the trial's first day anelderly woman accosted the businessman leaving the courtroomand accused him of stealing all her money, and weeks later, abondholder pulled a powdered wig from a travel bag in ahallway and hit Mr. Keating on the shoulder with it.   Yesterday, emotions continued to run high until the end.As the verdicts were read, elderly bondholders who hadattended each day during four months of thesometimes-emotional trial, held hands and murmuredexpressions of gratitude. &quot;Somebody up there was listening,&quot;one was heard to say.   While the California case is so far the only criminalproceeding arising from American Continental's problems orLincoln's failure, Mr. Keating is also the target of awide-ranging federal investigation into his business dealingsat the companies. The probe is said to concern allegedlyphony land swaps and other apparent bank fraud aimed atshowing paper earnings at the thrift and generating fatprofits for Mr. Keating and other principals.   Several former Keating associates have pleaded guilty tobank-fraud charges and are said to be cooperating withprosecutors from the U.S. attorney's office in Los Angelesand other officials.</TEXT></DOC>
