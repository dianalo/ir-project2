Meese's appearance Wednesday before the grand jury was hisseventh. The panel is believed to be focusing on Meese's Nov.22-23, 1986, investigation that uncovered the diversion ofarms-sale profits to the Nicaraguan rebels.   The attorney general has refused to comment on his grand juryappearances, but the Justice Department says he is cooperating withthe investigation being conducted by independent counsel LawrenceE. Walsh and is not a target.   The grand jury recently heard testimony by Assistant AttorneyGeneral William Bradford Reynolds, who found a memo revealing thediversion in National Security Council files, and AssistantAttorney General Charles J. Cooper, another member of the team.   Former White House chief of staff Donald T. Regan, who waspresent when President Reagan ordered Meese to conduct theinvestigation and when the attorney general reported his findings,has also testified recently.   Meese's investigation was criticized by congressional committeesthat held hearings last summer on the Iran-Contra affair. Thepanels faulted Meese for not recruiting Justice Department lawyerswith more experience investigating criminal cases and for failingto take notes during interviews with top administration officialsafter he learned about the diversion.   The congressional committees said Meese's failure to secureNational Security Council files allowed documents to be shredded bythen-national security adviser John M. Poindexter, NSC aide Lt.Col. Oliver L. North and others.   Poindexter resigned and North was fired after Meese announcedthat arms-sale profits had been diverted to the Contra rebels.   Poindexter and North are targets of the Walsh investigation.Indictments are expected to be returned in the coming weeks.   Meese also has testified six other times before a differentgrand jury investigating his financial dealings with a formerofficer of the scandal-plagued Wedtech Corp.</TEXT></DOC>
