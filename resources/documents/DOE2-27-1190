The effect of cuts in rapidity and p/sub T/ is demonstrated.A comparison to currently used low-p/sub T/ models shows that the two-chaindual parton model underestimates the experimentally observed correlationat large p/sub T/. The new version of the two-chain LUND-FRITIOF modelis better than the first version of this model, but still overestimatesthe correlation.</TEXT></DOC>
