As events of the past few weeks have demonstrated,its domestic policy is a shambles. Fresh evidence of disarraycame just yesterday as the White House scrambled to disavow aproposed directive limiting federal affirmative-actionprograms, drafted by the White House counsel, just as thepresident was preparing his ceremonial signing of newcivilrights legislation.   On civil rights, on economic policy and even on his ownre-election campaign, Mr. Bush is displaying none of thedecisiveness that marked his successful prosecution of theGulf War and other foreign-policy victories. Theadministration's economic strategy -- do nothing, for now --is undermining public confidence. The abrupt decision topostpone a presidential trip to Asia infuriated the Japaneseand Koreans and may make them less cooperative when Mr. Bushdoes arrive in January.   George Bush's allies inside and outside the administrationincreasingly blame autocratic White House Chief of Staff JohnSununu and are urging the president to replace him. EvenBarbara Bush is said to be convinced that the former NewHampshire governor's &quot;flaws are fatal,&quot; says one person closeto the administration. &quot;Half the cabinet isn't speaking tohim, and everybody goes around him,&quot; the person says aboutMr. Sununu. Speculation is rampant among the White Housestaff that Mr. Sununu could be out by year end. &quot;He's giventhe president sufficient cause,&quot; to fire him, says EdRollins, a Republican political consultant.   But it's Mr. Bush who ultimately bears the responsibility.&quot;He's the trumpet player,&quot; says Sen. Nancy Kassebaum, aKansas Republican. &quot;And if the trumpet sounds uncertain, whowill wish to follow?&quot;   To be sure, Mr. Bush is not alone in his confusion aboutthe economy. There is no consensus among Democrats, amongeconomists or in the business community as to what should bedone. Moreover, the president has had to face a recalcitrantCongress that he claims has blocked his every move. &quot;I thinkwe've got the answers,&quot; he said in a speech here Wednesday.All the Democrats do is &quot;knock the hell out of the presidentevery single day.&quot;   Bush supporters also point out the president still hashigh approval ratings in the polls. But Hugh Heclo, politicalscientist at George Mason University, says Mr. Bush's supportis &quot;very, very thin.&quot; Because Ronald Reagan's convictionswere so well known, Mr. Heclo says, he was in betterpolitical shape with a 55% approval rating than Mr. Bush iswith 75%. &quot;There are not a lot of people who really believein him and his mission,&quot; Mr. Heclo says. &quot;They don't knowwhat his mission is.&quot;   That's understandable. Consider:   Mr. Bush said Congress should cut the capital-gains tax,as he proposed in February, to revive the economy. But hewon't keep Congress in session to act on a tax bill becausehe doesn't want to get caught &quot;in some meat-grinder&quot; ontaxes.   Mr. Bush said he won't be hectored by Congress intoavoiding his foreign-policy responsibilities. But hepostponed the important trip to Asia after House Democratsmade fun of him.   Mr. Bush said it's all right for him to tell banks tolower credit-card interest rates. But it's not all right forCongress to make them do it.   At first, Mr. Bush opposed extending unemploymentbenefits, arguing the recession was over. But after Democratsbeat up on him, he did an about-face.   Perhaps most embarrassing of all was yesterday's flip-flopover civil rights. For the past year, the president hadinsisted that the rights legislation pending on Capitol Hillwas a &quot;quota bill&quot; even though Republican allies such as Sen.John Danforth of Missouri said it wasn't.   Then, spooked by the specter of ex-Klansman David Duke'sRepublican campaign for governor of Louisiana, the presidentreversed course and cut a deal with Congress. The president,whose own political instincts are moderate, seemed relievedto put the divisive civil-rights issue behind him and invitedmembers of Congress and the civil-rights community to joinhim at the signing ceremony.   But the occasion was ruined by a proposed presidentialdirective that White House Counsel C. Boyden Gray firstcirculated Wednesday afternoon and planned for Mr. Bush toissue at the bill-signing. The directive -- potentially moresignificant than the new civil-rights law itself -- wouldhave dismantled the &quot;Uniform Guidelines on Employee SelectionProcedures&quot; that affect the hiring practices of all U.S.businesses with more than 15 employees, &quot;as soon as islegally feasible.&quot; It also called for elimination oflongstanding federal hiring practices that involve &quot;the useof quotas, preferences, set asides or other similar devices.&quot;   Senior White House officials, including domestic policychief Roger Porter and White House spokesman MarlinFitzwater, reviewed the document Wednesday night and quicklyrecognized it as a problem. So did Sen. Danforth, who saidthe draft statement would have &quot;totally eclipsed the law thatwas signed.&quot; Aides complained to Mr. Bush, who had beenunaware of the directive, and, according to Mr. Fitzwater,&quot;He said: `Correct it.'&quot;   By Thursday morning -- with Labor Secretary Lynn Martinand Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner joining theprotest -- the directive had been dropped from thepresident's bill-signing statement. But the incident has leftMr. Bush's affirmative-action policy under a cloud. &quot;DavidDuke lost the election in Louisiana,&quot; charges Rep. BillRichardson, a New Mexico Democrat, &quot;but he has won the heartsand minds of the people in the White House.&quot;   Mr. Gray says he &quot;never intended, and no one I know of hadthe intention, of bringing affirmative action into question,and that's regrettable and it's my mistake. I'm confidentthis mistake would have been avoided had the clearanceprocess run its course before the issue became public.&quot;   Mr. Fitzwater contends that the president backsaffirmative-action programs that comply with the new law andthat the courts will decide whether existing federal programscomply. But a senior White House official says conservativeswithin the administration may try to revive the directiveafter the furor subsides.   The result of these flip-flops: an extremely muddled WhiteHouse message just as the public begins to pay attention tothe 1992 campaign. &quot;What's important is that the presidentcall the play,&quot; says Mitch Daniels, former Reagan White Housepolitical director. But not only has Mr. Bush failed to dothat, he hasn't even decided the players in his re-electionbid at a time when congressional leaders and a half-dozenDemocratic presidential candidates are attacking him daily.   Mr. Bush looks equally uncertain on economic matters. Withthe strength of the recovery in doubt, and with someeconomists and business executives questioning whetherthere's a recovery at all, he has decided to try to boost theeconomy with rhetoric and defer any initiatives until theState of the Union address next year.   But Mr. Bush is having a hard time coming up even withcompelling rhetoricand that's hurting his standing withexecutives and consumers. &quot;It's like the emperor keepssaying, `I've got my clothes on,'&quot; says Finn Caspersen, chiefexecutive of Beneficial Corp., a big consumer-financecompany. &quot;People want leadership. One thing people did likeabout the Gulf War: It was clear-cut. It was good leadership.And people knew where we were going. They're not getting thatnow.&quot;   Mr. Sununu and Budget Director Richard Darman have beenurging the president to speak optimistically about theeconomy in order to bolster public confidence. And he didjust that last week, telling Fortune 500 executives that 1992would see &quot;the best growth we've seen in years&quot; and a &quot;newera of prosperity.&quot;   But other aides, including Michael Boskin, his chiefeconomist, are advising that such rhetoric may destroy thepresident's credibility. And in the past few days, Mr. Bushhas begun to sound more realistic. &quot;I don't want to emphasizejust the bad things to talk us into a depression,&quot; thepresident said this week in an interview with televisionstations affiliated with NBC. &quot;And I don't want to emphasizeonly the good things to make those car dealers think I'm outof touch.&quot;   That will be a challenge for Mr. Bush if he does go on theroad next month, as planned, to Florida, Mississippi,Illinois and San Bernardino County, Calif. But GOP ChairmanClayton Yeutter thinks such a trip is a smart movenonetheless. &quot;This could make a positive contribution topublic confidence of the president being on top of thesituation,&quot; he says. &quot;It would also give him an opportunityto articulate precisely what the constraints are on him.&quot;   The biggest constraint, of course, is the huge federaldeficit -- and the deficit-reduction law that Mr. Bush signedlast year and still supports. &quot;The government painted{itself} into a nasty box,&quot; says Lynn Michaelis, chiefeconomist of Weyerhaeuser Co. &quot;There's really very little itcan do to stimulate this recovery.&quot;   Many of the president's political advisers, however, arguethat Mr. Bush must do something to show he understands andcares about the nation's economic problems. And lobbyists,cabinet secretaries and members of Congress are busilypromoting all sorts of plans to stimulate the economy. Justyesterday, financial markets moved on rumors that theadministration was embracing a tax credit for people who buyU.S.-made cars, a notion that Commerce Secretary RobertMosbacher has discussed. But a White House spokesman quicklymade clear that the administration wouldn't support such aplan.   On economic matters, Mr. Bush must fight off criticismboth from liberal Democrats and from conservatives within hisown party, who are eager to press their tax-cutting agenda.In particular, the president may face a primary challengefrom conservative columnist Patrick Buchanan, who is certainto attack his inaction on the economy. (The Buchanancandidacy may also make it harder for the president todismiss Mr. Sununu, who is his main tie to Republicans in NewHampshire, where an early primary is held.)   Some Republicans, meanwhile, are complaining that theWhite House is standing in the way of enacting part of the&quot;economic growth&quot; plan that he says he favors. Many lawmakersfrom both parties favor extending 12 soon-to-expire taxbreaks, one of the largest of which is a Bush administrationfavorite -- the research-and-development tax credit. &quot;If theywant it, they can get it,&quot; Sen. Danforth says. But he says hehas suggested 20 different ways to pay for the extensions --which would cost $4.7 billion over five years -- and theadministration won't say which it favors.   It is just such indecision and missteps on domesticmatters that are getting the administration -- and especiallyMr. Sununu -- in trouble. &quot;On foreign policy, they have agood team that basically works well together,&quot; Sen. Kassebaumsays. &quot;That hasn't existed on domestic policy. I don't knowif it's because Gov. Sununu basically directs domestic policyor something else.&quot;   ---   Staff reporters Michel McQueen and Timothy Noahcontributed to this article.</TEXT></DOC>
