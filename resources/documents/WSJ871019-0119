The former BankAmerica Corp. unit posted net of $9.5 million, or 46 cents a share. A year earlier, the predecessor company had net of $7.9 million.    Revenue rose 51% to $116.3 million from $76.9 million a year earlier. The company's chairman, Charles R. Schwab, cited continued growth in its customer base and an increase in market activity. He said the company opened 96,000 new accounts in the third quarter and more than 400,000 in the year ended Sept. 30.    For the six months ended Sept. 30, Schwab posted net of $22.2 million, or $1.09 a share, on revenue of $229.5 million. Because a leveraged buy-out in which the company separated itself from BankAmerica last spring and a subsequent public offering substantially changed Schwab's financial structure, comparable year-earlier figures weren't available.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Schwab closed at $12.875, down 75 cents, in Friday's sharply declining market. In its initial public offering on Sept. 22, Schwab priced its shares at $16.50 each.    It isn't clear what impact, if any, the recent stock market plunge and the possible start of a bear market would have on Schwab and its customers. Mr. Schwab, however, said: &quot;I've been running this company for 17 years and have lived through a number of declining markets. We've seen declining volume but (also) a rising new account base because customers become unhappy with their old brokerage firm and come to us.&quot;    He also said it isn't clear whether the stock market's recent fall signals the start of a bear market or is only a reaction to a bull market.    &quot;I don't totally subscribe to the view that this is the end,&quot; he said.    Mr. Schwab said the company now has about $4 billion of the $16 billion it manages for customers in investments other than stocks, such as certificates of deposit, money market funds and short-term Treasury bonds.    Hugo Quackenbush, senior vice president, said some small investors use falling markets as an opportunity to buy blue-chip stocks at reduced prices. For this reason, he said, a short-term market downturn could benefit Schwab.    But in the longer term, he said, if stock-exchange volume falls 20% to 25% over the next year, &quot;it would be very difficult for us to show earnings growth.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
