Heritage, the IBMsenior scientist coordinating the project, &quot;we must know what doctors need.andO;We need to understand how fast we must transmit images from the radiologydepartment to a patient's bedside in intensive care and how good theresolution of tumors must be to treat cancer patients.andP;  That's why it's soimportant that university physicians are working with engineers andscientists to plan and test the system.&quot;andM;The prototype system will include three different types of medical imagingstations, linked together by a computer network, all three will draw imagesfrom a hospital-wide database.andP;  The computer system will hold digitizedversions of standard hospital X-ray films and ultrasound images, as well ascomputer-aided tomography (CAT) scans and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)scans.andM;(Barbara E.
