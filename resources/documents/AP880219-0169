WILSON</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>VATICAN CITY (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Pope John Paul II on Friday blamed therivalry between East and West for social and economic ills in theThird World and delivered a sweeping indictment of totalitarianism,materialism and the ``all-consuming desire for profit.''   In his seventh encyclical, the pope accused both the U.S.- andSoviet-led blocs of imposing ``imperialism'' and ``structures ofsin'' on developing nations, reducing them to ``cogs on a giganticwheel.''   He also said the rivalry between the East and West was mainreason for the widening gap between rich and poor countries.   ``An unacceptably exaggerated concern for security ... deadensthe impulse toward united cooperation by all,'' he said.   This obsession, he said, works to ``the detriment especially ofpeaceful peoples who are impeded from their rightful access to thegoods meant for all.''   The encyclical called for reform of the international financialsystem and said the church could do its part by selling its``superfluous'' goods to help the poor.   The 102-page document also called for democratic politicalchange in nations with corrupt, dictatorial or authoritariangovernments.   The pope said the church took a critical view of both liberalcapitalism and Marxist collectivism, saying both systems areimperfect and in need of urgent ``radical correction.''   The encyclical, titled in Latin ``Sollicitudo Rei Socialis,'' orthe social concern of the church, included some of the strongeststatements on social and economic issues made by John Paul duringhis 9{ years as pope.   An encyclical is a formal pastoral letter written by the popefor the entire church. While encyclicals are not infalliblepronouncements, Catholics are expected to heed the message.   The pope said his letter was addressed to all followers of theworld's great religions.   The letter painted a bleak picture of the process of developmentsince the publication of Pope Paul VI's encyclical ``Development ofPeoples'' in 1967.   Twenty years later, hopes for development ``appear very far frombeing realized,'' and for many poor people ``the situation hasnoticeably worsened,'' John Paul said.   A Vatican official familiar with the drafting of the encyclicalsaid it reflected the pope's Polish background and addressed issuesfacing people living in the Soviet bloc that were not raised inPaul VI's document.   Breaking new ground, John Paul singled out East-West rivalry asthe cause of many of the world's problems.   ``The conflicts ... between East and West (are) an importantcause of the retardation or stagnation of the South,'' he wrote.``The developing countries, instead of becoming autonomous nationsconcerned with their own progress ... become parts of a machine,cogs on a gigantic wheel.''   ``The present division of the world,'' the document added, ``isa direct obstacle to the real transformation of the conditions ofunderdevelopment in the developing and less advanced countries.''   ``World peace is inconceivable unless the world's leaders cometo recognize that interdependence in itself demands the abandonmentof the politics of blocs, the sacrifice of all forms of economic,military or political imperialism, and the transformation of mutualdistrust into collaboration.''   In an apparent reference to conditions in his native Poland, thepope complained of the suppression of economic initiative, whichleads people to emigrate, and the denial of political and economicsovereignty in some countries.   Condemning totalitarianism, he said, ``No social group, forexample a political party, has the right to usurp the role of soleleader.''   The pope said the church itself should avoid accumulating``superfluous church oranments and costly furnishings for divineworship.''   ``On the contrary it could be obligatory to sell these goods inorder to provide food, drink, clothing and shelter for those wholack these things,'' he said.   Cadinal Roger Etchegary said the statement was mainly symbolic,recalling the time John Paul gave away his pastoral ring during atrip to Brazil. Etchegary, president of the Vatican's Justice andPeace Commission, spoke at a news conference.   The pope lamented the overemphasis on economic development,writing, ``Development which is merely economic ... will end byenslaving (mankind) further.''   The document denounced the phenomenon of ``superdevelopment,''or the excessive availability of material goods in some areas thatmakes people ``slaves of possession.''   It also condemned ``all-consuming desire for profit'' and``thirst for power'' that afflicts both individuals and nations.   ``If certain forms of modern imperialism were considered ... wewould see that hidden behind certain decisions, apparently inspiredonly by economics or politics, are real forms of idolatry: ofmoney, ideology, class, technology.''</TEXT></DOC>
