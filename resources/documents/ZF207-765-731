(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>BUYER'S GUIDE TEXT RETRIEVALandM;Whether you need to find a letter, a project report or to gain access totechnical information needed by your service engineer -- access toinformation stored on disk is a perennial problem for users.andP;  Fortunately,there are now a considerable number of information retrieval packagesavailable, with applications ranging from personal to office informationmanagement.andP;  As always, the problem is to choose the most appropriate packagefor your needs.andM;Text retrieval packages started as modifications of traditional 'widget'databases.andP;  The databases were adapted to support records containing freetext and conventional fields which hold numeric and date information.andP;  Textretrieval packages also adapted conventional database tools for use withtext, allowing keyword searches to be augmented using wildcard characters andwith the logical operators AND, OR and NOT -- these search tools are nowuniversal.andP;  Strix, from UK Microbel (reviewed in Issue 76), and AskSam aresuccessful examples of this genre.andM;Packages catering for access to large volumes of text, such as technical orreference information, usually index text to give fast access.andM;In the indexing procedure, a file is produced which contains informationabout the location of every word -- excluding common redundant words, such as'or', 'but' and 'the'.andP;  Access to search words is dramatically improved byfirst looking up their positions in the index file rather than by laboriouslysearching through every document checking for target strings, a task that isboth time consuming and hard on the disk drives.andM;Examples of successful packages giving fast access to large volumes of textare Recall Plus from Bristol-based Insoft (reviewed in Issue 76) andLogotron's Hyperbook.andM;Recent products aimed at helping the individual in text-based retrievalcombined with hard disk management are Lotus' Magellan, which uses highlyefficient indexed access and Traveling Software's Viewlink, which usescharacter searching (both products reviewed in Issue 102).andM;At the other end of the scale are products aimed at managing document storageand retrieval for networked office systems with large volumes of distributedstorage.andM;There are two excellent examples of office text-management systems in Equifaxand Document Manager.andM;Equifacs is from Dublin-based Vision Computing, which uses an AI-likeprocedure to categorize documents (reviewed in Issue 76) and Persona'sDocument Manager using indexed access.andM;To give you a feel for the power and versatility of contemporary textretrieval packages, AskSam, Document Manager and Hyperbook are reviewed asexamples of text-based packages available for individual and groupinformation retrieval and document management strategies.andM;AskSamandM;AskSam -- a single-user information manager for the PC -- has come a long waysince the early version I first used about three years ago.andP;  In the latestrelease, AskSam version 4.1, records start as completely unstructuredelectronic paper which can hold unlimited free-text plus conventional fieldsif required.andP;  A field is defined simply by placing a tag -- similar to a DTPtext attribute tag -- in a record the first time it's needed.andP;  Fields can bestructured to hold text, numbers, dates and times.andM;Text fields are defined as the field name surrounded by square brackets; forexample, the first instance of the tag [name] defines an unlimited lengthtext field called the name.andM;Specific combinations of fields, such as mailing or personal details, can betied to a function key to allow the addition of a structure to a record inorder to supplement any other information that it may hold.andP;  Up to tenstructuring templates can be defined for each file.andM;The beauty of AskSam is that any, of none, of the ten templates, or othersingle fields can be added to free text in any single record -- a highlyflexible implementation that allows a single database file to serve as anorganizer for a wide variety of business needs.andM;To provide the functionality associated with conventional structured 'widget'databases adapted for text-based operation, AskSam has powerful retrieval anddisplay procedures.andP;  These are supplemented by the logical operators AND, ORand NOT, with proximity searching which can be applied to free text orstructured fields: it can sum and average numeric fields; it supports dateand time arithmetic and has an excellent capability for report formatting.andO;One good feature is its ability to sort text fields on the last word in thefield -- allowing conventional entry of full names into name fields andproblem-free access by surname.andM;Individual records have to be separated with the @ character and, from withineach record in the ASCII file, structured information is assigned toappropriate AskSam fields if each field is prefixed with the identifyingfield-name tag.andM;Whilst there's nothing intrinsically difficult about using AskSam, there's alot to learn before you become confident and competent with it, as most ofits power is unleashed through command lines rather than menu-selection.andP;  Onthe plus side, over 150 pages of the well-presented manual are given to atutorial, with a good selection of practice files.andM;I may have misjudged its capability, though, since it was used as the storageand retrieval system for the Iran-Gate hearings!andM;* PLUS: Powerful and flexible text-based database management systemandM;* MINUS: Takes time to learn to use it effectively.andM;Document ManagerandM;More than just a text retrieval program, UK-based Persona's Document Manager(DM) offers a full-blown document management and retrieval system for thenetworked office.andP;  DM gives each user their own personalized workingenvironment from which they can create information by launching out intotheir usual application; it then gives fast and effective, butstatus-restricted, access to the information filed and indexed on thenetwork.andM;When a document has been edited or finished, the user exits from theapplication and automatically pops back into DM to update an electronic filecard.andP;  DM fills in information about date, file name and directory andrequests information about document class, expiry time of the item andsecurity classification.andP;  It then offers three free text areas which caninclude a summary of points covered or a list of key words.andM;Whilst it isn't mandatory to complete the file card, it's fields areindependently searchable and could be used as the core of a personal oroffice filling strategy.andP;  The file card also indicates the location of adocument which has been archived by the DM supervisor after it has passed itsexpiry date.andM;When a document is completed, DM indexes its contents -- giving fast-trackaccess to information.andP;  Indexing can be done by the individual user, but moreoften it will be carried out by the DM supervisor through DM's batch indexingfacility.andP;  Individual documents don't have to be indexed -- they can beaccessed via their file card information.andP;  This feature gives access to .PICor .TIF files, for example.andM;DM's functions also extend to managing the network's storage; a document thathas been indexed will be removed from the individual's working directory,avoiding the usual problem of storage overheads concerning multiple copies.andO;DM's management of storage space is note quite as bad as it sounds -- justhitting F3 returns a working copy to a legitimate user.andM;The DM supervisor plays a key role in maintaining the system, enabling accessto information through individuals' passwords and working groups.andP;  Groupingsof users can be based on their department and access to documents can berestricted to members of a group or to specific individuals.andP;  The supervisoralso has the task of deciding whether to archive or delete documents whichpass their expiry time.andM;Access to information is very flexible and can be based on file card fieldsor document contents.andP;  Search terms can be augmented by wildcard charactersand with additional search terms using the logical operators AND, OR and NOT.andO;Searches can be confined to single dates or ranges of dates, to particularclasses of documents or information on the document file cards.andM;The end product of search is a list of hits which can be sent to a printer orviewed on-screen.andP;  For document viewing, only the text information isdisplayed, not the text formatting.andP;  However, if a Lotus worksheet isdisplayed.andP;  DM shows it in worksheet cell-based format with the cell pointeron the cell containing the 'hit' information.andM;DM also supports group work on documents by letting an individual tag thedocument being used; until the document is relreased, others users can viewbut not edit it.andP;  The well-designed DM environment uses pulldown windowsaccessed by Alt plus initial letter.andP;  Whilst a network supervisor wouldbenefit from some training on the details of DM management, the well-writtenand well-structured manual provides good step by step instructions, and theaverage user should become familiar with the program after about half anhour.andM;* PLUS: A document management system that offers control over and good accessto the products of the electronic office.andM;* MINUS: None really spring to mind.andM;HyperbookandM;Hyperbook from Cambridge-based Logotron was top of my best-new-productcategory for the 1989 PC User Show.andP;  Hyperbook is the product of acollaboration between Logotron and Longmans publishing house offering a newaspect for PC use of information retrieval.andP;  Hyperbook comes in two parts;the first is a general purpose working environment designed to give book-likeaccess to text supplied in electronic indexed form; the second is softwarefor converting and indexing text for access through Hyperbook.andM;The Hyperbook working environment splits the PC's screens into three areas.andO;At the top of the screen is a conventional menu bar giving access to sixpull-down menus which offer Hyperbook's basic functions.andP;  In the middle ofthe screen is an eighteen-line text-viewing window, with the informationaccess functions grouped at the bottom.andP;  Here the display gives informationabout the current document and how to access it.andM;Hyperbook is mastered very quickly and requires little support from a manual;firstly, a text file and its index file are loaded from disk.andP;  For review,Logotron supplied two publications: the Green Book, which is a collection ofarticles on environmental issues (available as a demonstration system costing5 pounds sterling), and a collection of science and technology articles intwo volumes taken from the Profile Information On-line Database.andM;Loading the second science and technology volume and its indexes gives accessto five topic areas displayed in numbered windows: Headlines, Technology,Agriculture, Medicine and Atmosphere.andP;  Accessing the topics produces furthersub-topics for direct access or for on-line searching.andM;For example, accessing Headlines allows you to move to the next or previousheadline by hitting 'n' or 'p respectively; accessing Medicine gives accessto the Disease, Drugs, Genetics or General Medicine topics.andM;Direct access by hitting n(ext) or p(revious) to move from article toarticle, is like turning from chapter to chapter in a conventional book.andP;  Analternative strategy is to search for keywords -- linked if necessary by AND,OR or NOT.andP;  This is similar to accessing data via an index, though muchbetter, as Hyperbook allows you to move back and forth between hits byhitting 'n' or 'p'.andM;At any time during direct or search access to text the display tells youwhich page number you are on, which reference, the total number of pages andreferences available and the extent or proximity currently set for searches.andM;Although the text accessed through Hyperbook is Read only, the designers haveexploited the electronic media well by allowing the user to make marginalannotations.andP;  These are stored on disk for future reference and signalled bya musical note in the right margin.andM;Hyperbook is an interesting product which should become popular for thedistribution of technical and reference material.andM;Longmans have about a dozen titles currently available with more inproduction.andP;  The inexpensive Hyperbook retrieval and encode software moduleshould also encourage third parties to distribute information in this way;about 100,000 words can be distributed on a 360K floppy disk.andM;The only drawback I found with the system was an occasional hiatus as theretrieval program pulled in compressed text from disk and decompressed it fordisplay.andP;  Otherwise, Hyperbook provides a well-structured environment whichdoesnht obstruct flexible and efficient access to information.andM;* PLUS: Easy access to reference and technical information suppliedcommercially or formatted using the Hyperbook encode module.andM;* MINUS: The library of Hyperbooks is currently limited.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
