Gorbachev.    The Soviet leader recognizes their value as contributors to his paramount goal of economic modernization. He also sees them as a potential foil to the entrenched bureaucracy that is resisting his policies of change.    &quot;Gorbachev would like to rally the nation's intelligentsia to his reform barricades,&quot; says Stephen F. Cohen, a Princeton University Soviet specialist. Some Soviet experts see the release from exile of dissident physicist Andrei Sakharov as a powerful symbolic gesture aimed at boosting support for Mr. Gorbachev among the nation's intellectual elite. For them, the move represents further escalation in a campaign that combines greater openness with more-humane treatment of select dissenters and a partial relaxation of censorship in the arts.    According to this thinking, the 1975 Nobel Peace Prize laureate isn't only the symbolic representative of the country's severely diminished dissident movement. Mr. Sakharov, three-time winner of the nation's highest civil award, also reflects the hopes for liberalization quietly held by a broad section of the post-Stalinist generation, Soviet experts say. Mr. Gorbachev is the first Soviet leader of that generation and draws much of his political constituency from it.    The generation includes many of the creative, technocratic and political elite without whose assistance Mr. Gorbachev will fail in his drive to dismantle features of the Stalinist system that continue to cripple the Soviet Union's social and economic development, threatening its ability to compete as a superpower. These vestiges include an outmoded command model for the economy and a social order that relies more heavily on fear and intimidation than on public trust.    &quot;Stalin built a nation on the backs of peasants and industrial workers and many of the key biases of that system remain intact,&quot; says Marshall I. Goldman, associate director of Harvard University's Russian Research Center. &quot;The Russia Gorbachev envisages will be based on computer programmers, trained economic managers, and others with the knowledge to find solutions for the nation's chronic economic and social problems.&quot;    Many intellectuals in Moscow see Mr. Gorbachev's campaign to co-opt them demonstrated also by his personally approving distribution of formerly forbidden books, plays and films, and by his attempts to lure popular avant-garde director Yuri Lyubimov back from emigration. &quot;We as a class can provide a force for stirring the passive masses,&quot; says one disaffected writer. &quot;We can tip the balance in his struggle to restructure the economy and society.&quot;    But giving intellectuals greater status, a policy pursued for the past several years for similar reasons by Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping, faces substantial resistance.    Soviet watchers say intellectuals themselves may be reluctant to jump on Mr. Gorbachev's bandwagon, fearing the fickleness of Kremlin policy and a resurgence of conservatism, and feeling still too confined by the limitations the communist system forces upon them. Another obstacle is the fact that Stalin's anti-intellectual legacy runs deep, both among the general populace and within the gargantuan party and state bureaucracy that wields central control.    Opponents of Mr. Gorbachev's policies may view his effort to woo the intelligentsia as a further attempt to discredit the conservatives and their way of thinking. It won't go unnoticed by the more conservative wing of the Communist Party that Mr. Gorbachev's move to free Mr. Sakharov from exile comes as the party is gearing up for a plenum at which the Soviet leader is expected to try to oust remaining old-guard opposition on the Politburo and establish new rules on party cadres.    Conservative elements, however, may be mollified by the public relations benefits of Mr. Gorbachev's move, which could mute international criticism of Soviet policies as the Kremlin prepares for an international conference on human rights in Moscow.    Kremlin watchers say Mr. Gorbachev's effort to put a human face on Russian communism can be viewed partly as a tactical move that will be appreciated by most elements of the Soviet leadership. The chief thrust of Soviet propaganda -- the proclamation that the Soviet Union is dedicated to world peace -- is routinely undercut by Western accusations of Soviet infringement of the rights of its own people.    But Kremlinologists see more than propaganda in Mr. Gorbachev's move. As long ago as 1968, Mr. Sakharov wrote that there is an inseparable link between the Soviet government's treatment of its own citizens and its prospects for economic and social development. &quot;Today,&quot; says Princeton's Mr. Cohen, &quot;there is an overlap of the ideas Sakharov expressed . . . and the Soviet leader's own thinking.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
