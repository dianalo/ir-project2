The observances were in the form of vigils outside nuclearweapon plants, a mountain climb in New Hampshire, a bicycle ride inCalifornia and the signing of a scroll in Boston.   The observance In Hiroshima itself, 50,000 people attended aceremony in memory of the 78,000 people killed instantly in theworld's first atomic bomb attack.   At the Washington Monument in the nation's capital, protestersarranged 30,000 warhead-shaped cones to form a ``ban-the-bomb''symbol, containing the likeness of a mushroom cloud. Organizerssaid the 6-inch cones were designed to represent a fraction of the50,000 warheads stockpiled between the superpowers.   ``Our demonstration today is part of raising the public'sconsciousness. I think we get very accepting and just used to allthe nuclear weapons out there. We're here to poke at people,'' saidPat Jackson, an organizer of the protest.   Actor Martin Sheen was among 64 people arrested for misdemeanortrespassing at the Nevada Test Site, 65 miles northwest of LasVegas, in an anti-nuclear protest. He has been arrested on trespasscharges several times while participating in anti-nuclear rallies,which have been conducted with growing frequency at the desert site.   The protest came 11 days before a planned major nuclear weapontest that will judge the ability of the United States and SovietUnion to measure the size of each other's nuclear tests.   At Seal Beach Naval Weapons Station in California, 24 protesterswere arrested for trespassing on government property.   About 60 anti-nuclear activists gathered outside the SavannahRiver Plant in Aiken, S.C., for a silent vigil. The plant is thenation's only production site for the plutonium and tritium used innuclear weapons.   Outside the Pantex Nuclear Weapons Plant, northeast of Amarillo,Texas, the fifth annual Peace Camp opened with a sunrise meditation.   Peace activists climbed Mount Monadnock in southern NewHampshire to hold daylong vigils at the summit through Tuesday, theanniversary of the bombing of Nagasaki, Japan.   Elsewhere in New Hampshire, six woman tried but failed to hangpeace symbols on a military monument at the headquarters of theunit whose predecessor dropped the atom bombs on Hiroshima andNagasaki.   A solid line of military personnel kept the members of the NewHampshire Women's Network for Peace from the seven-footmushroom-cloud-and-eagle emblem of the 509th Bombardment Wing atPease Air Force Base.   At Indianapolis, people who believe the bombing of Hiroshima wasnecessary to end World War II and save many lives gathered at theIndiana World War Memorial during the morning for prayers and ashort ceremony.   Kathy Nikou, Indiana spokeswoman for the Washington, D.C.-basedCenter for Peace and Freedom, said the bombing saved lives becauseotherwise it would have been necessary to take over Japan island byisland.   Residents of Portland, Ore., awoke Saturday to find the pavementscattered with thousands of pale ``shadows'' painted byanti-nuclear activists in memory of the bombing of Hiroshima.   About 150 participants in the Shadow Project claimed to havewhitewashed 2,700 human and animal silhouettes on streets andsidewalks in the 3{ hours before dawn.   While they worked, a smaller rival group calling itself theSolution Project painted placards of shields, outlines of theUnited States and people carrying signs with the message, ``No MoreShadows _ Defense Works.''   In Boston, the Women's International League for Peace andFreedom asked passers-by on Boston Common to sign a scroll and alsowrite in the name of a victim of the Hiroshima bombing.</TEXT></DOC>
