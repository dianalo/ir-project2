But that hasn't fazed some industry executives, directorsand other major shareholders. In roughly the past threemonths, these insiders have become aggressive buyers of theirown companies' shares, Securities and Exchange Commissionfilings show.</LP><TEXT>   Insider buyers in the trucking industry are outnumberingsellers five-to-one, the filings show. Among the companiesinvolved are: truckers Xtra Corp. and Cummins Engine Co.,traded on the Big Board, and Nasdaq's Builders TransportInc., Venturian Corp., MNX Inc. and Werner Enterprises Inc.   David Walentas, chairman of Builders Transport of Camden,S.C., purchased 114,500 shares of the company's stock for$499,760 late last year, SEC filings show. He said the stockhad been oversold on fears of skyrocketing oil prices to thepoint of being &quot;cheap.&quot; He paid an average price of $4.36 ashare; Builders stock had been trading in the $9-to-$12 rangeprior to the Iraqi invasion. It closed yesterday at $3.75 ashare in national over-the-counter trading.   &quot;Fuel is awfully high because of the Middle East {war},and even though they're burning some of it in Kuwait, there'sa lot of oil,&quot; said Mr. Walentas, alluding to reportsyesterday that Iraqi troops had set fire to some Kuwaiti oilfacilities. &quot;Whether the war is over in two weeks or twomonths, it's going to be over. Fuel prices will come backdown.&quot;   While Mr. Walentas has a paper loss on the investment sofar, overall, trucking industry insiders' faith has alreadypaid off in some other cases. Prices of some trucking companyshares are up 30% or more from the prices insiders paid.   The trucking industry's one big inside seller in lastyear's fourth quarter could have gotten a higher share priceif he had waited. Ryder System Inc.'s chairman, Mitchell A.Burns, sold 82,524 shares for about $1.1 million, or anaverage of $13 a share, in October and November, SEC filingsshow. Ryder stock closed yesterday on the New York StockExchange at $15.50.   Mr. Burns declined to comment on his sale. SEC filingsshow he retains about 43,300 shares of stock, held directly.A spokesman for Ryder said Mr. Burns sold the shares for&quot;personal, estate-planning reasons&quot; and retains optionsrepresenting 500,000 additional shares of stock.   For investors thinking about buying trucking stocks now,some companies could offer still further price appreciation,said Douglas Rockel, a Merrill Lynch andamp; Co. analyst. Whileseveral trucking-related stocks have had &quot;a good run,&quot; muchhigher-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings for some of themcould give share prices another big boost, he said.   Mr. Rockel is bullish on the trucking companies, theactual commodity transporters, rather than truckmanufacturers or support companies, because &quot;none of themotor carriers have been materially affected by higher fuelprices&quot; even though their stocks have been sold off as ifthey had been.   Trucking stocks are so-called double-whammy stocks -- notonly are they linked to oil-price swings, but also arerecession-sensitive. Many of these stocks were trading nearhistorically low valuation levels last summer, before theMiddle East crisis battered them down even more, increasingtheir appeal to some insiders.   &quot;Our stock was at a very depressed point when shares werepurchased,&quot; by insiders last November, said Mary Jensen,chief financial officer of Venturian Corp. Venturian is theparent of Napco International, a defense, parts and truckingconcern.   While the company's book value (assets minus liabilities)is about $20 a share, Ms. Jensen said, she and two otherinsiders paid $6.25 a share for the stock they bought. SECfilings show the three insiders bought a total of 11,400shares of the Hopkins, Minn., company's stock. It closedyesterday at $8.50.   Similarly, Werner Enterprises Inc. director GeraldTimmerman paid $10.50 a share for 1,000 shares of hiscompany's stock on Oct. 12, SEC filings show. The stock ofthe Omaha, Neb., company closed yesterday at $17.50 inover-the-counter trading. Mr. Timmerman declined to commenton his purchase.   The shares of Xtra Corp. closed yesterday at $18,comfortably above the $14.53 average price that SEC filingsshow insiders paid for their purchases in October throughDecember.   The Xtra insiders responsible for the largest stockpurchases, Robert Goergen and Lewis Rubin, were namedchairman and president of the Boston truck-leasing concernlast March. The company's attorney declined to comment.   Five insiders at Cummins Engine Co. of Columbus, Ind.,which manufactures Diesel engines for trucks, spent a totalon $218,725 on their company's stock in October and November,SEC filings show. While their purchases were relativelysmall-4,000 shares was the largest-they increased theinsiders' total holdings substantially.   The Cummins Engine insiders paid an average per-shareprice of $33.65, the SEC filings show. In New York StockExchange trading, Cummins stock closed yesterday at $35.50.The company declined to comment on the insider purchases.   And at MNX Inc., a St. Joseph, Mo., trucker, SEC filingsshow that two insiders bought 4,500 shares while apartnership jointly held by company chairman Roger M. Crouchand MNX's president, Michael Head, purchased an additional40,000 shares. Mr. Crouch and Mr. Head couldn't be reachedfor comment.   All told, MNX insiders spent about $171,325, or an averageprice of $3.85 a share, according to SEC filings. Inover-the-counter trading, MNX shares closed yesterday at$3.875.</TEXT></DOC>
