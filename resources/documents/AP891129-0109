The rebels also burned a mansion just blocks away from theAmerican ambassador's official residence, but no injuries werereported to U.S. employees, according to the American officials.   It was not immediately clear if the fighting signaled theresumption of a major guerrilla offensive on the capital that beganNov. 11 and appeared to have ended when the rebels withdrew on Nov.22.   The rebels said on their clandestine radio today they hadattacked the headquarters of the Joint Chiefs of Staff withmortars. But officers on the scene said none had fallen in thecompound, which also houses the Defense Ministry. Reporters saw atleast six dead soldiers in one neighborhood and one dead guerrillain another.   Residents of the zone, in the capital's western sector, saidthey heard several loud explosions near the fortified complexbetween 2 a.m. and 3 a.m.   Rebels fired rocket-propelled grenades and assault rifles at thePublic Security Academy in the western suburb of Merliot. Col.Rigoberto Soto, director of the academy, said the attack wasrepelled. He said his troops suffered no casualties but that a fewguerrillas appeared to have been wounded.   Fighting continued to be heavy after daylight on the edge of theaffluent Escalon neighborhood, which reaches to the slopes of theSan Salvador volcano, a guerrilla stronghold.   Wilfredo Hernandez, soundman of a crew of the Spanish languagenetwork Univision, was wounded in the back in the fighting in upperEscalon.   Fighting was heavy at times before dawn along the tree-linedstreets of San Benito, a wealthy residential district where U.S.Ambassador William Walker has his official residence. Guerrillasburned a mansion just blocks from Walker's house. It was notimmediately known whether Walker was home at the time.   Some of the homes attacked belonged to U.S. Embassy employees,but all the Americans were reported safe, White House spokesmanMarlin Fitzwater told reporters in Washington.   Secretary of State James A. Baker III later told reporters inWashington that the rebels were ``shooting their way into andinvading certain private homes. They briefly overran the home of aU.S. Embassy officer but were driven out by the Salvadoran armedforces.''   Walker lives in the same neighborhood, Baker said.   Baker also cited unconfirmed reports that the rebels alsoinvaded the Japanese embassy in San Salvador. He offered no furtherdetails. ``It is our belief that all United States personnel andtheir families are safe but several are in their homes in this areaof heavy fighting,'' he said.   Guerrillas and soldiers of the U.S.-supported, rightistgovernment also exchanged fire in Guadalupe, south of the Chiefs ofStaff, where three light tanks were positioned across the streetfrom a movie theater.   Helicopters and O-2 spotter aircraft fired machine guns androckets at suspected guerrilla positions west and south of thecapital for several hours before dawn. Reporters saw at least sixdead soldiers and a burned light tank on the edge of Escalon, andone dead guerrilla near Guadalupe.   Rebels last week assaulted Escalon and briefly took over theblocks surrounding the El Salvador Sheraton Hotel.   That attack marked the conclusion of what may have only been thefirst phase of a massive rebel offensive launched Nov. 11, thelargest in the 10-year-old civil war that has killed an estimated71,000 people.</TEXT></DOC>
