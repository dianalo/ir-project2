Reagan must decide whether to seek a broader arms pact.    Gorbachev dangles the possibility of a summit agreement to cut strategic nuclear missiles by more than 50%, to go along with the already concluded intermediate nuclear forces deal. But the Soviet leader's price -- a U.S. promise to observe a strict interpretation of the anti-ballistic missile treaty for 10 years -- splits administration advisers.    Pentagon officials warn that Gorbachev's demand will put Reagan's Star Wars plan in a straitjacket. But State Department aides counter that it would be a small sacrifice for such a significant result and warn that Congress may end up restricting Star Wars anyway. National Security Adviser Carlucci hasn't yet taken a side.    Says a State Department official: &quot;We've got a battle royal ahead of us for the president's mind.&quot;    GREENSPAN'S OPTIMISM on inflation could prove premature.    The report of August's surge in consumer prices comes just days after the Fed chief declared that he sees no evidence of accelerating inflation. The sharp drop in unemployment this year, along with hefty wage increases, also suggests renewed inflation pressures, some economists say.    They suggest that the Fed could be forced to raise interest rates further if the pattern continues. While one month's numbers aren't a trend, says former Fed Gov. Lyle Gramley, &quot;unless we have some more monetary restraint we will begin to get pressure on wages and prices before very long.&quot; But White House officials believe the August increase is only temporary.    ORTEGA SUCCEEDS in tripping up White House Contra-aid plans.    U.S. officials worry that the Nicaraguan leader will continue to score propaganda points by dribbling out more concessions like the reopening of an opposition newspaper and the Catholic radio station. The longer he can make it appear that Nicaragua is moving toward peace, they fear, the longer Congress will put off consideration of Contra aid.    Largely to assuage restive conservatives, Reagan may send a $270 million aid request to Congress in the next few weeks. But administration aides won't push for a speedy vote, acknowledging that there is virtually no chance that lawmakers will act until after the Nov. 7 deadline set in the Central American peace plan.    White House aides argue that non-lethal Contra aid should continue no matter what, as insurance against Sandinista backsliding.    DEMOCRATIC DISSATISFACTION with the current crop of presidential contenders is reflected in a new Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll. Among likely Democratic voters, 57% wish someone else were running, while only 31% are generally pleased with the existing field. By contrast, 52% of likely GOP voters are pleased with their selection, while 34% want someone else.    BUSH SEES his lead over Dole evaporate among likely GOP voters in the new Journal/NBC poll. The survey shows the vice president ahead 30% to 29%, which is within the margin of error. In May, Bush led 30% to 20%. More bad news: 45% think the Iran-Contra probe hurt his chances to become president, even though he was barely mentioned in the hearings.    DOLE'S DILEMMA is how to play Reagan's nuclear-weapons pact when it goes to the Senate. As GOP leader, Dole would normally be the administration's point man, but that would damage his attempts to woo right-wing support for his presidential bid. He so far hasn't taken a position on the accord, and some think he will decide to let Sen. Lugar lead the pro-treaty forces.    CREDIT DUE? Though Meese publicly attributed to the FBI the recent arrest of a suspected Lebanese terrorist, intelligence sources say that the CIA's hush-hush Counterterrorism Center played a major role. If the suspect is convicted, the operation could provide a boost to the center's controversial chief, Duane Clarridge, who has been under investigation for his role in the Iran-Contra affair.    TAXING WORK faces congressional panels as they take up a revenue bill.    Lawmakers expect a measure raising $12 billion -- about twice what Reagan has proposed. Though many of the bill's components remain up in the air, one sure provision will repeal a $1.8 billion estate-tax loophole created by last year's tax reform measure. In addition, the measure will probably eliminate a scheduled reduction in the telephone excise tax.    Speaker Wright suggests a &quot;luxury&quot; tax on such items as furs, jewelry and yachts, which Ways and Means chief Rostenkowski may consider. The House panel talks about taxing appreciation on estate transfers. But the Senate Finance Committee is unlikely to agree, fearing a detrimental effect on family farms.    Finance Chairman Bentsen hopes for &quot;some accommodation&quot; with Reagan to avoid a veto but warns &quot;we're not going to accept all&quot; the president wants.    MINOR MEMOS: A caller urges Sen. Leahy to back the Supreme Court nomination of &quot;Bjorn Bork.&quot; Another caller urges support for &quot;George Borscht.&quot; . . . As the naval buildup continues in the Persian Gulf, Egypt increases Suez Canal tolls for military ships by 25%. . . . Asked by a Des Moines radio interviewer whether he has a message for the voters of Iowa, Bush's initial response is, &quot;No.&quot; He eventually comes up with one. </TEXT></DOC>
