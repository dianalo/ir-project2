The Federal Aviation Administration invited the companies to showthe technology, on the market for the first time this spring, duringthe 10-day gathering at Le Bourget airport north of Paris.   In recent years, searches, metal detectors and X-ray machineshave become routine at airports, and the number of hijackings hasdeclined. But passenger planes remain vulnerable to hidden devices.   It takes less than a pound of plastic explosive, the size of achocolate bar, to bring down a jumbo jet. The deadly material can bemolded into shapes that are easy to hide.   Such an explosive hidden in a radiocasette player is believed tohave caused the death of 275 passengers anbd crew who were aboardPan Am flight 103, which fell in pieces onto the Scottish village ofLockerbee in December.   Thermedics Inc. of Woburn, Mass., came up with a ``sniffer'' thatdetects chemical vapors. The $125,000 hand-held sniffer, calledEGIS, is a computerized chemical analyzer with programmed rules,called algorithms.   ``If you look at the last 15 incidents of bombing or attemptedbombing, in six of them the bomb found its way into the aircraftcabin,'' said Thermedics President John W. Wood Jr. on Sunday.``This illustrates the need to screen people and carry on bags aswell as checked luggage.''   Thermedics has developed a second sniffer that is about a yearaway from the markeplace. It is called SecurScan and works on thesame principle as EGIS but is designed as a walk-through chambersimilar to the now common metal detector.   A second new device is being shown by Science InternationalApplications Corp. of Santa Clara, Calif. Their apparatus is calleda thermal neutron activation, or TNA and sells for $900,000.   Baggage passes on a conveyor belt through a chamber where it isshowered with neutrons that react when exposed to nitrogen, thechemical emitted by virtually all explosives. The reaction producesa scattering of gamma rays, a sort of chemical fingerprint that isanalyzed by a computer.   Six units have been purchased by the FAA for installation at NewYork's Kennedy Airport and London's Gatwick and 12 others will beinstalled in high-risk airports in the United States and overseas.</TEXT></DOC>
