Temperatures dropped to record lows at 35 cities from the GreatLakes to the Gulf of Mexico as arctic air surged southward. Miamihit a record low of 37, equalling the temperature at Minot, N.D.   The chilly weather at Miami Beach, which had a low of 39, forcedNBC's ``Today'' show indoors to the Carlyle Hotel. The show hadmoved south to boost a local affiliate and show some warm weather toa shivering nation.   Slippery roads were blamed for hundreds of accidents and schoolswere closed from Georgia to New Jersey. Three weather-related deathswere reported.   ``All the roads are covered, we've got ice, and people arewrecking right and left,'' said Officer Dennis Anders of theAlleghany County, N.C., Sheriff's Department.   The storm dumped 6 to 12 inches of snow across southeasternVirginia and wind gusted to 60 mph, said Terry Ritter, chiefmeteorologist for the National Weather Service in Norfolk. He saidit was the region's first storm classified as a blizzard since 1980.   The wind generated waves up to 12 feet on Chesapeake Bay and20-foot waves were reported on the Atlantic Ocean, Coast Guardofficials said.   The Navy cut back on all but essential services, and delayed thedeparture of seven Norfolk-based ships that had been scheduled tosail Friday morning to the North Atlantic or a three-week exercise.   ``The problem is visibility. There is none,'' said Lt. Cmdr.Steve Burnett, a spokesman for the Atlantic Fleet.   The storm veered northeastward and snow began falling onMassachusetts' Cape Cod by late morning while its wind was felt atsea.   A Coast Guard cutter raced most of the day to reach a disabledfishing trawler with five men aboard fighting snow and 30-foot seas50 miles off Chatham, Mass.   The 270-foot cutter Escanaba reached the 75-foot trawler Paul andDominic, based in Gloucester, Mass., and began towing it south withthe wind behind it, said Coast Guard Chief Petty Officer Jack Mason.   ``It's very dangerous,'' Mason said. ``Seas are between 20 and 30feet, which is monstrous. Visibility is real limited, with snow.''   Temperatures fell into the teens across parts of Mississippi,Alabama and Georgia _ with wind chills below zero _ just over a weekafter record highs in the 70s and 80s brought peach trees anddaffodils into premature bloom.   Record lows included 16 degrees at Birmingham, Ala.; 19 atMobile, Ala., on the Gulf Coast; and 28 at New Orleans. Atlanta tiedits record of 17. Grand Rapids, Mich., hit a record 9 below zero.   Shelters in Birmingham, Ala., opened their doors to peopleneeding a warm place for the night. ``Anyone can come is as long asthey don't cause problems,'' said police community service officerAlton Morgado.   The cold was especially noticeable to tourists.   ``It's probably warmer in New York,'' Kristin Horne, 28, said inFort Lauderdale, Fla. ``I didn't bring any warm clothes to Florida.We couldn't even go to the beach today and it looks like thisweekend we'll have to drink and stay warm somehow.''   ``Hot chocolate sells really well when the weather gets cold,''said Larry Barton, an assistant manager of a Publix supermarket inPlantation, Fla. ``We can't keep it in stock.''   Tourists in Florida should be happier after a warming trendbegins Saturday. It is expected to push temperatures into the 70sstatewide by Monday, said the National Weather Service.   The snowstorm formed as a low pressure system off the coast ofthe Carolinas. The storm center, spinning counterclockwise, rakedits wind across the coast out of the northeast, earning it the labelof a ``nor'easter.''   Wind gusted to 59 mph near Cape Hatteras, N.C., and the stateshut down six of the seven ferries it operates along the coast.   Blizzard conditions were reported along the Outer Banks islandsand in North Carolina's Gates and Hertford counties, where 18 inchesof snow and drifts to 3 feet were reported, the weather service said.   Roads through North Carolina were covered with snow, up to 11inches fell in parts of eastern Virginia and drifts 3 to 4 feet highwere reported in Delaware, the weather service said.   ``Snow shovels and rock salt. Those are the two biggest sellersat the moment,'' said Jennifer Tillman, an employee at PleasantsHardware in Winston-Salem, N.C. ``We sold out of sleds Saturday orwe'd be selling those, too.''   Up to 9 inches of snow was measured at McKee City, N.J., with 8inches at Margate and northern Cape May County, the weather servicesaid.   ``The road crews are out in full force, but as soon as they plow,the wind covers the road over again,'' said New Jersey State PoliceTrooper Robert Roesch in Burlington County.   Delaware Gov. Michael Castle ordered some state offices closedFriday because of the storm.   The cold threatened some crops in the South.   At Plant City in central Florida, where an annual strawberryfestival is planned to open March 2, farmers struggled to shieldtheir plants.   ``You know how your stomach feels when you think you could loseeverything you worked for? That's the feeling we're getting now,''said Tommy Brock, whose fields are east of Plant City.   However, cloud cover kept the temperature just above freezing atPlant City, farmers said.   Peach growers in Alabama burned tires and coal in orchards duringthe night to protect trees against the cold, but there werescattered reports of damage.   Citrus growers in central Florida reported no problems Friday,thanks partly to light wind that stirred up the air, but weatherservice forecaster Emmett Ricks said Friday night was going to becolder.   Elsewhere in the South, flood-stricken Kentucky was declared amajor disaster area by President Bush Friday, making federal aidavailable to affected people and local governments. The region washit by heavy rain and flooding beginning Feb. 13.</TEXT></DOC>
