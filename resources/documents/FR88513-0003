Gonter, Assistant DeputyAdministrator, Compliance Program, Meat and Poultry Inspection Operations,Food Safety and Inspection Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Washington,DC 20250, (202) 447-7745.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2><ITAG tagnum="84">Executive Order 12291</ITAG>This final rule has been designated a ``non-major'' rule under E.O. 12291.It will not result in an annual effect on the economy of $100 million ormore. There will be no major increases in costs or prices for consumers,individual industries, Federal, State, or local government agencies, orgeographic regions. It will not have a significant effect on competition,employment, investment, productivity, or upon the ability of United States-basedenterprises to compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or exportmarkets.This regulation concerns procedures to be followed by the Department priorto referral for prosecution of suspected violators of the FMIA. As such,it does not address the economic or marketing issues which are the subjectof E.O. 12291.<ITAG tagnum="84">Effect on Small Entities</ITAG>The Administrator of FSIS has determined that this final rule will nothave a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entitiesas defined by the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), Pub. L. 96-354 (5 U.S.C.601 <T3>et seq.</T3>). This rule does not raise the economic considerationswhich are the subject of the RFA. Accordingly, the RFA is not applicableto this rulemaking.<ITAG tagnum="84">Background</ITAG>Under the Federal Meat Inspection Act (FMIA) (21 U.S.C. 601 <T3>et seq.</T3>), the Secretary has responsibility to assure consumersthat meat and meat food products distributed to them are wholesome, notadulterated, and properly marked, labeled, and packaged. In this regard,the FMIA provides that certain violations of the Act will subject individualsand firms to criminal sanctions unless, as provided by section 406(b) ofthe FMIA (21 U.S.C. 676(b)), the violations are minor and the Secretarydetermines that the public interest would be adequately served by a suitablewritten notice of warning.Section 403(c)(2) of the Processed Products Improvement Act (Title IV ofthe Futures Trading Act of 1986 (Pub. L. 99-641)) added a new section 406(c)to the FMIA. The new section requires that the Secretary give reasonablenotice and an opportunity to present views to persons suspected of havingviolated the FMIA, prior to the Secretary's referral to the Departmentof Justice of charges for criminal prosecution. The new section also authorizesthe Secretary to make exceptions to the requirement of prior notice bypromulgation of regulations. Because section 406(c) of the FMIA went intoeffect upon enactment of the Processed Products Improvement Act of 1986,the Administrator of FSIS determined it was essential to issue regulationsto implement it in order to protect certain ongoing and future criminalinvestigations and cases. Accordingly, an interim rule was published onApril 27, 1987, to amend Title 9 of the Code of Federal Regulations byadding a new Subpart titled ``Criminal Violations'' (52 FR 13828). TheAdministrator determined that the ability of the Department to protectthe public by investigating and prosecuting suspected violators of theFMIA could have been compromised without publication of the interim rule.<ITAG tagnum="84">Description of Interim Rule on Notice of Proceedings and Opportunityfor Presentation of Views</ITAG>The interim rule provided that persons suspected of violating the FMIAwill be provided reasonable notice that USDA intends to report such violationsfor prosecution in a criminal proceeding, and that, prior to reporting,such persons will have an opportunity to present to USDA views with respectto such proceeding. The notice will summarize the suspected violationsand will inform the suspected violator that the violator has a specifiednumber of days from receipt of the letter to respond, orally or in writing,to the Director, Evaluation and Enforcement Division, Compliance Program,FSIS. The notice will be sent by registered or certified mail. All viewspresented in response to and in accord with the notice will be consideredbefore reporting the violations for prosecution, and all documentationof such views will be incorporated into the Department's official recordin the matter.The interim rule also identified the following five situations in whichthere are compelling public interests that preclude the giving of noticeand an opportunity to present views prior to the reporting of suspectedviolations for criminal prosecution:1. When there is the possibility for destruction or alteration of evidence,or where disclosure could result in injury to persons or property.2. When there is the possibility of flight of a suspected violator to avoidprosecution.3. When there is the possibility of the compromise of special investigativetechniques, such as undercover or other covert operations.4. When the impending referral involves suspicion of bribery and relatedoffenses, or clandestine slaughtering and/or processing operations.5. When the impending referral for prosecution is part of a broader investigationinvolving non-Act violations, and the Act and non-Act violations are jointlyreferred for prosecution.These exceptions address situations where giving notice would compromisean investigation and negatively affect the Department's investigative andenforcement programs.<ITAG tagnum="84">Summary of Comments</ITAG>FSIS received two comments from trade associations in response to the interimrule. Both comments supported the general intent of the interim rule, butexpressed reservations about various aspects of the exceptions. The followingare the issues raised by the comments and FSIS's response to each:1. <T3>Comment:</T3> One commenter asked that the ``use of any exception ** * be scrutinized by judicial review before the exception may be exercisedby the department.'' The commenter expressed concern that the absence ofthe ``judicial reviews'' in the interim rule represents a due process deficiency.<T3>Response:</T3> The Processed Products Improvement Act of 1986 providedno mechanism for the type of ``judicial review'' requested by the commenter.Congress intended for the creation of exceptions by regulation and theexercise of the exceptions without an interim level of review. The conductingof such review would be contrary to that intent. Furthermore, the delayinvolved in requiring the Agency to go into court each time it intendedto invoke one of the exceptions would effectively thwart the use of theexception and endanger investigations in the manner this rulemaking isintended to prevent.2. <T3>Comment:</T3> The other commenter expressed concern that the exceptionsto the prior notice requirement were overly broad. The commenter was especiallyconcerned about the exception which referred to the joining of Act andnon-Act violations, suggesting that the Department could subvert the priornotice requirement by deliberately joining non-Act violations.<T3>Response:</T3> In situations where Act and non-Act violations wouldbe jointly referred for prosecution, USDA personnel would be involved inthe matter with persons from other government agencies. In many cases,the prior notice and an opportunity to present views would have a negativeimpact on the pursuit of non-Act violations by parties other than USDA.In many of the cases, the discovery of FMIA violations is incident to abroader investigation of another matter. Therefore, the rule affords theSecretary discretion to make exceptions to the prior notice requirementin such situations.<ITAG tagnum="84">Final Rule</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 9 CFR Part 335</ITAG>Meat inspection, Withdrawal of inspection, Administrative practice andprocedure, Criminal violations, Criminal procedure.<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 335_RULES OF PRACTICE GOVERNING PROCEEDINGS UNDER THE FEDERALMEAT INSPECTION ACT</ITAG>Accordingly, we are adopting as a final rule, without change, the interimrule that added Subpart E and that was published at 52 FR 13827-28 on April27, 1987.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority:</T4> Section 406, Pub.
