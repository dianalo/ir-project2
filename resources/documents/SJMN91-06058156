Asians -- the fastest-growing ethnicgroup, with a 191.4 percent increase -- are concentrated in areas on the northend of the city and in the central core. The Hispanic population, which grew41.1 percent, now accounts for more than half the people on the city's eastside and in parts of the central city.;    The 10-member city council has twonon-Anglo members. District 5's Blanca Alvarado is Hispanic. District 7'sGeorge Shirakawa is Hispanic and Japanese-American.;    Both districts,especially Alvarado's, have significant Hispanic populations.;    In fact,when the city began electing council members by districts in 1980, an effortwas made to establish District 5 boundaries so that it was likely a Hispanicwould be elected.;    The district boundaries will be redrawn later this yearbased on the new census information. The city charter calls for 10 councildistricts that split the population evenly among them. That means councilboundaries will have to be shifted to reflect the new-growth areas in thenorth and the south, such as Berryessa, Evergreen and Almaden Valley.;   &quot;When you combine the minority population figures and the concentrations ofthat population -- that's pretty compelling. . . . In the long term that meansit's likely minorities will tip the scales in elections from school boards tocity councils to higher offices,&quot; Carrillo said.;    That appears already tohave happened in the Alum Rock School District, where all five school boardmembers are Hispanic.;    The Census Bureau uses the term &quot;Hispanic&quot; todescribe people of Latin American or Spanish ancestry. As used by federalofficials, it can include blacks or whites, as well as people of Asian andAmerican Indian descent.;    The Mercury News has substituted the term &quot;Anglo&quot;for what the Census Bureau calls &quot;non-Hispanic whites.&quot;;    Bob Brownstein, alongtime participant in local politics, said minority groups can still wieldconsiderable clout even if they aren't grouped in a single district.;    &quot;Astrong voting minority is better off having 30 percent of its population intwo districts than 60 percent of it in one because the power is spread out,&quot;Brownstein said.;    An example of that theory is mobile home owners' groups,which are scattered across the city, but whose members are politically vocaland active.;    &quot;They're tremendously influential because they affect severaldifferent districts,&quot; Brownstein said.;    But if there's a low voter turnout,he said, &quot;you want them in one district because it takes virtually all of themto make a difference.&quot;;    Traditionally, turnout in District 5 has been halfof that in predominantly Anglo District 10, even though the districts haveroughly the same population.;    So the real challenge is encouragingparticipation from the ethnic groups.;    In a multi-ethnic society,Brownstein said, you have to find a way to involve the biggest group. &quot;There'shardly a situation where an ethnic majority isn't in power that you don't havemega-trouble,&quot; Brownstein said. &quot;This state's going to be an incrediblepolitical laboratory in the next decade.&quot;  </TEXT><BYLINE>  MALINE HAZLE, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910227  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Wednesday  </DAY><MONTH>  February  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO; MAP  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  809  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Wednesday February 27, 199100058156,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
