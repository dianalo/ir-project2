The bill, which passed on a 360-53 vote, would fund all Pentagon operations for the year beginning Oct. 1 except military construction projects, civil defense and nuclear warheads, which are covered by other legislation. A defense-spending bill is pending in the Senate.    The measure moved through the House with uncommon harmony, as lawmakers avoided fights over arms-control provisions that have embroiled defense-spending bills in previous years. This year, that battle is being waged in the Pentagon authorization bill, which is currently being considered by a House-Senate conference committee. Authorizing legislation defines which programs the government may carry out and sets spending ceilings for those programs, while appropriating legislation funds the programs.    The House spending bill represents a 1.4% decrease in defense spending from current levels, after inflation is taken into account. The legislation would give the Pentagon $556.6 million less than the Reagan administration had requested and make changes in spending priorities.    Research into the president's Strategic Defense Initiative, for instance, would be funded at $3.2 billion under the bill, $400 million less than current spending and $1.3 billion less than the administration request. National Security Adviser Colin Powell has said he would advise Mr. Reagan to veto any bill that makes &quot;crippling&quot; cuts to the program.    The measure would give $100 million for development of the controversial plan to base the 10-warhead MX missile on railroad cars, or $693 million less than the administration had sought. Development of the truck-mounted, single-warhead Midgetman missile, on the other hand, would be given $600 million, $400 million more than the administration had requested.    The measure would also provide $475 million to fight drug smuggling, most of it to buy planes, helicopters and patrol boats. The administration objects to $410 million in the bill earmarked for the Coast Guard's drug efforts, arguing that the money should come from domestic rather than defense spending.    The spending bill also includes many smaller directives. For instance, one would bar the Navy from buying anchor and mooring chains made outside the U.S. Only one U.S. company, Baldt Inc., which employs 70 people in Chester, Pa., produces those chains. Baldt has a $3.9 million contract with the Navy for this year, according the company's Washington representative.    The provision was sought by Pennsylvania Rep. Joseph McDade, the ranking GOP member on the House appropriations subcommittee on defense, on behalf of Rep. Dick Schulze (R., Pa.), in whose district Baldt is located. Several years ago, the Navy found a Spanish company that produced chains meeting its quality requirements at a lower price than Baldt's.    Also, the report accompanying the bill earmarks $500,000 of the Air Force's $92.8 billion budget next fiscal year to attack a Japanese beetle infestation on Terceira Island in the Azores, and directs the Air Force to spend another $500,000 from its current operation and maintenance funds for the project. The insects apparently hitched rides aboard U.S. Military Air Command flights to the U.S. air base on the Portuguese island and are damaging crops there, according to congressional aides.    When Portugal asked the U.S. for money to battle the beetles, the Pentagon said some of it should come from the State Department's foreign aid budget, the aides said. But the State Department argued, and lawmakers agreed, that the Pentagon should pay to solve the problem, since the Air Force created it.    The measure also rejected the administration's request to end a requirement that U.S. military bases in Europe buy coal from the U.S. and a prohibition on their conversion to other fuels. </TEXT></DOC>
