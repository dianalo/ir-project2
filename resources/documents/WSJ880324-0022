Sources in New York, Panama City and Washington said a letter written on Banco Nacional de Panama stationery was sent March 22 to all banks in Panama instructing them to deposit into a New York account at the Chase Manhattan Corp. unit all checks for Banco Nacional. The account was in the name of Banco Latinoamericano de Exportaciones, or Bladex. The letter contained a postscript saying: &quot;Do not make reference to the fact that the payment is in favor of Banco Nacional.&quot;    A Chase spokesman in New York said that, contrary to rumor in Panama, it had never offered to act as a clearing house for Banco Nacional checks. Sources said Banco Nacional later withdrew the letter, calling it a mistake.    The letter puzzled many because any funds sent to New York would be vulnerable to attempts by Panamanian opponents of Gen. Noriega to have the funds blocked by the courts.    &quot;It was a scam,&quot; said a source allied with the Panamanian opposition. &quot;It didn't work because Chase turned it off.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
