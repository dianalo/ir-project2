The decision to rid itself of the businessmen and other``hostile and anti-party elements'' came during a meeting of thecapital chapter's Central Committee that ended Sunday.   In another development, the government announced today that morethan 13,600 people have turned themselves in for embezzlement,taking bribes and other economic crimes since August when thegovernment announced a 10-week leniency period.   Official corruption had been one of the chief complaintsexpressed by leaders of the pro-democracy campaign.   Those who do not surrender will be severely punished, saidgovernment prosecutor Zhang Siqing.   During the gathering Sunday, Beijing Party Secretary Li Ximingemphasized the need to carry on the ``class struggle'' againstparty enemies.   Li, an ideological hard-liner, said the party must ``rely on theworker's class wholeheartedly'' and fight all who ``belittle anddeny the worker's position and role,'' the official Beijing Dailyreported today.   The attack on private entrepreneurs and reference to classstruggle _ a concept largely ignored in the past 10 years of reform_ were indications of the anti-liberal campaign's continuedmomentum four months after troops crushed the pro-democracymovement in Beijing.   The official Xinhua News Agency said the Beijing party committeedemanded that all members in the city re-register in the comingyear as part of a drive to ``purify the party organizations.''   ``A drive will be conducted to examine and investigate how partymembers, especially officials with a party membership, behaved inending the national turmoil and quelling the anti-governmentrioting,'' it said.   The paper was referring to the spring student protests fordemocratic reform, which the government ended with a militaryassault that left hundreds of unarmed civilians dead.   The report, which did not mention how many of Beijing's 10million residents are party members, said only ``a very smallnumber of hostile and anti-party elements will be resolutely purgedfrom the party.''   It indicated that private businessmen, called ``exploiters,''will be a prime target.   ``The resolution stipulated that exploiters cannot be admittedinto the party, and those who have already been party members mustadhere to the party's ideals,'' Xinhua said.   ``Besides getting their own due pay, they should spend theirpost-tax profits on production and public welfare and should notuse them for their own private needs. If they fail to do so, theycan no longer be party members.''   Former capitalists faced constant persecution during the firstthree decades of Communist rule. Over the past 10 years, however,private businessmen have flourished under senior leader DengXiaoping's economic reforms and his slogan of ``to get rich isglorious.''   But since the June crackdown on dissent and the ascendancy ofideological hard-liners, the party has insisted there can be nochallenge to the socialist system. It has said that those peopleallowed to do business on their own must be kept under closesurveillance.   Some cities have put limits on how much private businessmen maypay themselves, and tax collectors have been told to tighten theirmonitoring of the 19 million privately employed in China.   The Workers' Daily reminded readers last week that the abolitionof private property is the foundation of Marxist theory, and whileprivate ownership is tolerated today because of China's weakeconomic base, the eventual goal remains to eliminate it.   Party Secretary Li took a swipe at another stalled politicalreform _ the separation of party and administrative functions _ bysaying the leadership of the party in the workplace must not bedenied.   Party secretaries should respect managers and shouldn't ``takeover every administrative thing,'' but managers should accept partycontrol ``not as bondage but as an essential guarantee for well-runsocialist enterprises.''   Former Party General Secretary Zhao Ziyang, ousted in June afterhe was accused of supporting the students, is also charged withweakening the party by calling for less intervention in dailyoperations of government offices and factories.   Li said China must ``sincerely uphold the party's leadership onevery front'' as the battles against infiltration, subversion and``evolution'' toward capitalism reach new levels of intensity.</TEXT></DOC>
