But many political officials and diplomats believe that a limited offer is unlikely to defuse the political crisis. In fact, rejection of the government's offer could touch off more demonstrations and a crackdown by the increasingly defensive government.    More-substantial concessions by the government to advance the process of democratization are unlikely, because they would compel Mr. Chun to give up his master plan for political succession and the establishment of the Democratic Justice Party, or DJP, as the core of the government.    On the other hand, the imposition of martial law or use of military force to quell the nationwide protests would intensify doubts about Seoul's commitment to developing a truly democratic political process and about its ability to host the Olympic Games in September 1988.    The government faces this dilemma after a fortnight of violent demonstrations that have rocked the nation and swelled the ranks of the opposition. The latest protests were touched off by the DJP's formal nomination on June 10 of Mr. Roh to succeed Mr. Chun. That followed Mr. Chun's suspension of debate over constitutional reform on April 13.    Prime Minister Lee Han Key, a legal scholar appointed by Mr. Chun last month in a cabinet reshuffle aimed at defusing earlier protests, clearly alluded to the possibility of imposing martial law in a public statement Friday.    &quot;If it should become impossible to restore law and order&quot; through appeals and promises to resume dialogue with the opposition, Mr. Lee said, &quot;it would be inevitable for the government to make an extraordinary decision.&quot; The latter phrase is commonly taken to mean emergency decrees or martial law.    Mr. Chun and his circle of generals and political advisers have been warning for more than a week that they are ready to take such steps to keep the civil disturbances from destabilizing the country.    So far, more moderate voices in the ruling circle are prevailing, including that of Mr. Roh, who &quot;knows he stands to lose everything,&quot; a Western diplomat said, if the government makes a wrong move now.    Mr. Roh met Saturday with some opposition leaders and promised a solution to the turmoil this week. Officials said he is likely to offer a limited resumption of the constitutional debate, with the proviso that any reforms wouldn't take effect until after the Olympics.    But many political officials and diplomats said the government and the DJP will have to offer a much more comprehensive package of reforms to defuse the crisis, including:    --Resumption of full constitutional debate, with direct presidential elections as an option.    --Agreement to a nationwide referendum to decide whether the Korean people want a president elected by direct vote or by a parliamentary system.    --Release of all or most of thousands of political prisoners and abolition of, or sharp limitations on the use of, the National Security Act, which has been used to arrest and imprison thousands of government critics and enemies of the state.    --Freedom from house arrest for the nation's leading political dissident, Kim Dae Jung, and restoration of his civil rights, taken away in 1980 when he was convicted of sedition.    DJP officials said such dramatic concessions are out of the question, though they realize that there probably isn't any chance of the opposition accepting much less.    &quot;I am deeply pessimistic,&quot; said a DJP official. &quot;I'm afraid that we've missed the chance for compromise. It's now probably going to be a traditional Korean 'winner-take-all' outcome.&quot;    That sentiment is echoed by a diplomat, who said that if the government had been &quot;less greedy and more willing to offer some crumb of democratization,&quot; it might have avoided &quot;or at least muted&quot; the outrage over Mr. Roh's unchallenged nomination. &quot;Now, I'm afraid it's too late for tokens or gestures of good will,&quot; the diplomat said.    U.S. officials in Seoul, meanwhile, admit to being concerned about the level of strife, and about the anti-American overtones of many of the demonstrations.    Gaston Sigur, assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs, plans to arrive in South Korea tommorow to reiterate two messages to Mr. Chun, that it's time to resume constitutional-revision talks, and that it's important to exercise restraint against demonstrators. Secretary of State George Shultz, currently in Asia, addressed both points in news conferences last week.    Mr. Sigur, speaking yesterday on NBCTV's &quot;Meet the Press,&quot; said he plans to stress the need for dialogue with opposition leaders and to tell Korean officials that &quot;talk must lead to action.&quot; He said he didn't think the possibility of a coup by military officers was a &quot;serious problem at this time.&quot; Mr. Sigur also is expected to meet with major opposition leaders during his visit. </TEXT></DOC>
