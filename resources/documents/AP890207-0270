Officials of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., which insuresdeposits at commercial banks, and the Federal Savings and LoanInsurance Corp., which performs the same function for Sandamp;Ls,announced that combined regulatory teams from the two agencies hadbeen put into place at four insolvent Sandamp;Ls located in Maryland,Florida, California and Texas.   Within a month, officials said they hoped to have federalregulatory teams in place at approximately 224 Sandamp;Ls which are stilloperating even though they are technically insolvent.   The announcement came just a day after Bush unveiled theadministration's plan to overhaul the Sandamp;L industry. Officials saidthey were moving with dispatch to emphasize the urgency of theproblem.   Officials said that all of the insolvent Sandamp;Ls would continuenormal operations. However, their operating decisions will besubject to approval from the federal regulators. The institutionswill remain under government control until regulators can findbuyers.   Regulators were urged to take this action last week by theGeneral Accounting Office, the auditing arm of Congress. The GAOsaid that the sick Sandamp;Ls needed to be ``effectively isolated'' fromthe healthy segment of the industry.   In the past, the sick Sandamp;Ls have been able to offer higher ratesof return in an effort to attract depositors' money, thereby biddingup the cost of funds for the total industry and increasing theultimate cost to the government of bailouts.   Estimates have been that the industry's losses, including theinsolvent institutions which were allowed to continue operating, wasadding $1 billion a month to the total bailout cost.   The four institutions taken over on Tuesday were BaltimoreFederal Financial of Maryland; Freedom Savings and Loan Associationof Tampa, Fla.; Pacific Savings Bank of Costa Mesa, Calif., and GillSavings Association of Hondo, Texas.   Two of the institutions, Freedom and Gill, were already undergovernment control in a supervisory program run by Sandamp;L regulators.Under the new initiative announced Tuesday, the Sandamp;L regulators willbe joined by regulators from the FDIC and other federal bankingagencies.   ``If you walked by the institution the next day, the only way youare going to be able to tell we are in there is there will be a fewmore people in the offices,'' said FDIC Chairman L. William Seidman.   Officials said that between 1,200 and 1,500 government regulatorswill be involved in the massive supervisory undertaking, half fromthe FDIC and the Sandamp;L agencies and the other half from the FederalReserve and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.   Seidman said that the government regulators would be seeking tominimize operating losses at the institutions, eliminate speculativelending practices and seek out and halt any continuing practices ofinsider abuse and fraud.   Bush's plan to overhaul the Sandamp;L industry, which the presidentunveiled Monday, calls for the FDIC to take administrative controlof FSLIC, the Sandamp;L insurance fund.   While the funds contributed by banks and Sandamp;Ls would be keptseparate, the FDIC would manage both insurance funds in Bush'sproposal. The total takeover of the Sandamp;L insurance fund by the FDICwould require congressional approval.   However, the joint supervisory effort did not need congressionalapproval to be implemented.   M. Danny Wall, chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board,which oversees FSLIC, emphasized that the employees of both the FDICand FSLIC would strive to work in ``full cooperation and harmony.''   Officials said that while about three or four of the 224insolvent institutions would be closed, in most cases the governmentregulators would keep the insolvent institutions open until Congresscomes up with the $50 billion rescue package recommended by Bush.   Wall said the institutions were being taken over by governmentregulators on a priority basis which would deal first with thelargest insolvent institutions that were losing money at the mostrapid clip. The four institutions taken over on Tuesday all had loanportfolios and other assets in excess of $1 billion.   Both Democrats and Republicans on Tuesday pledged to seek abipartisan solution to the Sandamp;L crisis and praised Bush for actingdecisively in the early days of his administration.   Senate Banking Committee Chairman Donald Riegle, D-Mich., said heand Sen. Jake Garn of Utah, the panel's ranking Republican, wouldjointly sponsor the administration's package. Riegle said he hopedto schedule hearings in the next two weeks in his committee to beginironing out differences concerning the plan.   ``I am determined to see us act quickly in the committee to matchthe speed of the administration,'' Riegle said. ``When we are losingon the order of $33 million a day (from Sandamp;L operating losses), allof us are under enormous responsibilities to get this package done.''   His counterpart, House Banking Committee Chairman Henry B.Gonzalez, D-Texas., also pledged quick action by his committee,saying he hoped to vote on the bill in the committee by the firstweek in March.   The Bush proposal, in addition to making changes in the way Sandamp;Lsare regulated, proposes raising the estimated $90 billion cost ofbailing out the Sandamp;L industry through a combination of tax dollarsand higher insurance premiums paid by banks and Sandamp;Ls.   Some members of the Senate Banking Committee questioned whetherthe funding approach represented the proper mix between taxpayermoney and industry funds, but senators were generally supportive ofthe overall approach.   Former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker, testifying beforethe committee on the Sandamp;L crisis, also urged quick congressionalaction on the Bush package, saying he believed it addressed all themajor problems facing the Sandamp;L industry.   Volcker did say he was concerned that deposit insurance premiumsnot be raised to such a level that they harmed the ability of Sandamp;Lsand banks to compete with other industries in offering financialservices.</TEXT></DOC>
