up to the individual services,said Cynthia Kendall, deputy DOD comptroller for information resourcesmanagement.andM;The CIM effort will cost $100 million, Kendall said.andP;  The other $188 millionrepresents savings to be achieved by slowing down development of systems thatwould duplicate the CIM.andM;But a recent General Accounting Office report predicted CIM would save nomore than $80 million.andP;  The report, DOD's Budget Status: Fiscal Years 1990-94Budget Reduction Decisions Still Pending, said all the savings would occur infiscal 1991.andM;A working group will form next month to study how to merge the medicalinformation requirements of the three services and DOD agencies, Kendallsaid.andM;Officials have formed other groups to review requirements for DOD financialsystems, civilian payroll systems and warehousing systems, Kendall said.andM;The working groups will concentrate on identifying common needs, Kendallsaid.andP;  Also they will examine existing and developing systems to weed out thebest features of several systems, Kendall said.andM;&quot;Or, we might decide that the systems out there are so antiquated it's notworth trying to do anything with them, in which case we might just start overagain,&quot; she said.andM;DOD officials decided to include medical systems in the CIM after the HouseAppropriations Committee last year questioned whether the Theater ArmyMedical Management Information System (TAMMIS) would meet architecturalrequirements or support all the services.andM;Kendall said the working will consider specifically whether the Army systemis compatible with the $1 billion DOD Composite Health Care System.andM;The working group &quot;will be asking questions about TAMMIS related to ensuringthat it fits into the other pieces in the medical arena that are automated,&quot;she said.andP;  &quot;How do they all fit together?andP;  How do we make sure we don't haveduplication?andM;Each working group is led by a DOD policy expert in the particular function,she said.andP;  The services and agencies fill out the group &quot;as appropriate,&quot;with each providing a core group of experts in policy, operations and IRM forthe function area.andM;The weeding-out process of existing systems will be in large part bedetermined &quot;by what makes economic sense,&quot; she said.andP;  Unique systemscurrently in the early development stages are more vulnerable to beingscrapped altogether, she said, though those decisions have been left to theservices.andP;  Officials expect to name three other working groups by May.andP;  Thegroups will examine civilian personnel, materiel management and contractpayment systems, Kendall said.andM;Defining requirements in each of the seven functions could take &quot;from sixmonths to two years, depending on how complicated the function is and howrecently similar work has been done by the services.andP;  To the extent that theservices can bring in recent requirements, the process will be speeded up,&quot;she said.andM;Kendall acknowledged that one of the plan's major hurdles is to alter the&quot;parochial&quot; interests of working group members from the services.andM;&quot;It's just human nature for people to come to the functional groups with acertain bias toward their own service's systme,&quot; she said.andM;&quot;But we take them through a process where we stop and define what the missionand scope for a particular functional area is.andP;  'What's our vision for thefuture?andP;  How should we be doing this?'andP;  Then we begin breaking downindividual details to get to the functional requirements that are commonacross the department.&quot;andM;In a related matter, Deputy Defense Secretary Donald Atwood has named afederal advisory panel to determine the best way to integrate DOD managementsystems.andM;The advisory panel, known as the executive level group, is made up of seniorDOD officials and industry executives.andP;  David Hill, executive in charge ofcorporate information management for General Motors Corp., is chairman of thepanel.andM;The panel will recommend to Atwood an overall plan for CIM.andM;&quot;After they've defined what the overall approach for CIM will be, they'lldecide what the appropriate oversight for automated information systems is,&quot;Kendall said.andM;Specifically, the committee will recommend whether to merge permanently theDOD's Major Automated Information Systems Review Committee with the DefenseAcquisition Board, which oversees weapons systems.andM;The MAISRC temporarily became a DAB subcommittee in October.andM;The MAISRC recently has been working with another DAB subcommittee, theCommand, Control, Communications, Computers and Intelligence Council (C4I) onseveral projects, Kendall said.andP;  In the past the C4I group has overseenmission-critical systems or embedded weapons systems.andM;But because some systems involve both IRM and mission-critical functions, thetwo subcommittees are meeting jointly to review systems.andM;In January, the joint group reviewed the Worldwide Military Command andControl System's Automated Data Processing Modernization (WAM) program,Kendall said.andM;WAM is an ADP upgrade to WWMCCS, the strategic system by which the servicesreport combat readiness.andP;  Kendall said officials developing a system for theNorth American Air Defense Center also will brief the MAISRC-C4I group.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
