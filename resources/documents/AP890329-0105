DALE NELSON</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   President Bush on Wednesday embraced a privatecommission's report calling for federal pay increases as ``verytimely'' and said he will promptly ask Congress to raise the pay oftop executive branch officials, senators, representatives andjudges.   Bush spoke after receiving the recommendations of the NationalCommission on Public Service, a 36-member panel headed by formerFederal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker. The group called for stepsto make government jobs more attractive, including a pay raisenearly as large as the one Congress killed last month after publicoutcries over its magnitude.   Neither Bush nor White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwaterindicated what Bush's recommendation would be. It would have to beenacted by Congress.   ``This is very timely,'' the president told members of thecommission. ``In the next few days, I`ll be making some veryspecific proposals.''   Volcker would not speculate on whether he believed Congresswould endorse an increase, but said that based on talks withlawmakers, ``I do find some renewal of interest in the subject.''   House Majority Whip Tony Coelho, D-Calif., was more pessimistic,saying, ``Will something get done this year? I doubt it. Somethingneeds to be done but I'm not at all optimistic.''   The commission's pay proposal is similar to one made in thefinal weeks of the Reagan administration by a congressionallycreated commission that assesses federal pay every four years. Boththen-President Reagan and Bush endorsed that proposed 51 percentincrease, but it foundered on public opposition to a congressionalpay raise.   The Volcker Commission plan proposes some new wrinkles.   For one thing, only 25 per cent of the increase would beeffective immediately. The rest would wait until a new Congressconvenes in 1991.   For another, members of Congress would have to give up thespeaking fees, or honoraria, with which many supplement theirincomes.   ``Not only does such income create lingering doubts about theneed for an across-the-board increase, but it also underminespublic trust in national institutions,'' the panel said.   The commission also recommended pay increases for rank-and-filefederal employees, but suggested they be absorbed into existingbudgets by reductions in force and elimination of programs. It alsosuggested that the pay rates vary from locality to locality, basedon the cost of living.   Spokesmen for organized labor reacted coolly to this proposal.   John N. Sturdivant, national president of the AmericanFederation of Government Employees, endorsed the report ``as far asit goes,'' adding, ``Unfortunately, it is a jigsaw puzzle with someof the most important pieces missing.''   He said that besides giving raises to executives, non-managementfederal workers must also have their salaries raised to the levelof their private sector counterparts   ``Only after such action is taken can locality pay play arealistic role in bringing equity to federal workers,'' Sturdivantsaid.   Douglas Fraser, former president of the United AutomobileWorkers and a member of the commission, said that organized laborgenerally supports the commission's report, but disagrees with theproposal that pay vary from locality to locality. ``It creates inmany cases gross inequalities,'' Fraser said.   Among other recommendations:   _The president should ``set the highest standards of ethicalconduct for those who hold the public trust, and act quickly andfirmly to remove those who violate that trust.''   _ The financial disclosure process, ``while a key protectionagainst conflicts of interest, should be streamlined to ease theburdens on potential appointees.''   _The number of presidential political appointees should bereduced from the current level of about 3,000 to about 2,000 andcareer officials should more frequently be considered forsub-cabinet appointments.   _The president and Congress should establish a public servicescholarship program open to 1,000 students who would receivetuition and costs in return for a commitment to a specified term ofgovernment service.</TEXT></DOC>
