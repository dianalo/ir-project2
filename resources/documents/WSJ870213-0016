The three-judge panel affirmed the entire $7.53 billion in actual damages, plus interest, that a jury here awarded to Pennzoil in November 1985. But it reduced punitive damages to $1 billion from $3 billion. Following a 4 1/2-month trial, the jurors found that Texaco unlawfully interfered with Pennzoil's merger agreement with Getty Oil Co. when Texaco acquired Getty in January 1984.    Texaco, saying it would immediately appeal to the Texas Supreme Court, derided the decision as &quot;absurd,&quot; &quot;appalling&quot; and &quot;patently wrong.&quot; And although Texaco found plenty of company for its view in legal and oil industry circles, some lawyers said that the court's decision could only give more credibility to a jury verdict that initially was dismissed as a fluke.    &quot;It underscores the seriousness of this,&quot; said Frank W. Morgan, a lawyer here who formerly was associate general counsel for Gulf Corp., now a Chevron Corp unit. &quot;It is no longer a joke.&quot;    The most pronounced effect of the decision was to close off Texaco's only absolute avenue to appeal the state-court judgment. Texaco can request, but is not guaranteed, a review of yesterday's ruling by the Texas Supreme Court. Moreover, if the Texas high court takes the case, it has no power to review the facts underlying the judgment -- only the application of the law.    Texaco said that if necessary it would appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court, but the company would have to convince the justices that federal issues are at stake. Texaco lawyers have said they have gone out of their way to raise federal issues during the appeals as a way of ensuring eventual U.S. Supreme Court jurisdiction.    Alfred C. DeCrane, Texaco's chairman, insisted that Texaco is certain to secure another appeals forum. He cited a strong attack by the attorney general of New York on the lower court's interpretation of New York contract law, which applied in the case. &quot;The New York attorney general has come in with a brief saying the trial judge misled the jury -- and that the jury was turned in the wrong direction,&quot; he said. Under those circumstances, he added, the possibility that the appeals are closed is &quot;a prospect I wouldn't entertain.&quot;    Pennzoil expressed &quot;delight&quot; and &quot;gratitude&quot; at the outcome of Texaco's initial appeal. Joe Jamail, the company's lead trial lawyer, said the company intended to comply with the appeals-court order that it voluntarily drop $2 billion from the judgment; the court said that unless Pennzoil did so, the entire case would be remanded to a lower court to be heard again.    A Pennzoil spokesman added yesterday that by his company's calculations, the amount of the pending judgment now totals $10.21 billion, including the reduction of $2 billion but taking account of accrued interest charges. With interest continuing to build, &quot;tomorrow they can add another $2.5 million,&quot; the spokesman added.    Industry analysts and executives were almost universal in the view that the ruling will increase pressure on Texaco to negotiate a settlement -- something the parties have failed to do after about a half-dozen attempts. But following yesterday's decision, neither side was speaking in conciliatory terms.    &quot;If the seriousness of this doesn't sink in now, those people don't have the collective IQ of a geranium,&quot; said Mr. Jamail, Pennzoil's acerbic trial lawyer. As for a settlement, he said: &quot;Pennzoil is still available to receive proposals. The door is open. They've just refused to come through it.&quot;    Texaco's Mr. DeCrane asserted that the company wouldn't let Pennzoil use the decision as a club. &quot;For a court to allow that kind of terrorism in the courtroom to carry over into some sort of negotiation is really kind of polluting the well,&quot; he said.    Texaco's newly appointed chief executive officer, James W. Kinnear, was equally adamant. Reached as he was about to board a plane in Washington, Mr. Kinnear declared: &quot;If it takes the last breath in me, I intend to get vindication.&quot;    In a prepared statement, Texaco also decried the &quot;chilling effect&quot; the decision could have on other corporate transactions and accused Pennzoil of &quot;investing in litigation&quot; to &quot;reap windfall profits far beyond those which the company could earn from its business.&quot;    Yesterday's decision makes it more crucial than ever for Texaco to receive a positive ruling from the U.S. Supreme Court in a side issue of the case: whether Texaco should have to post an appeals bond in the full amount of the judgment, plus interest and costs. Federal courts at two levels have saved Texaco from a probable Chapter 11 bankruptcy-law filing by freeing the company from the bond requirement, called for under the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure. Pennzoil had appealed those federal court decisions to the U.S. Supreme Court, which probably won't rule on the matter until late summer or early fall.    &quot;The vise is closing on them,&quot; said Alan Edgar, director of energy services for Prudential-Bache Capital Funding. &quot;Texaco can't afford even a semi-negative decision&quot; on the issue of posting bond.    Mr. Kinnear said -- and industry officials concurred -- that for now the appeals court's action likely won't alter Texaco's day-to-day business operations. But it stirred new nervousness among Texaco's suppliers, and several conceded that if these were boom times for the oil industry, other companies probably would hesitate in bidding for Texaco projects.    &quot;This is a buyer's market, and you can't turn down a job, whether it's from Texaco or anyone else,&quot; said an executive of one service company that does considerable contract work for Texaco. &quot;Obviously, we'll be watching it real close, but Texaco isn't going to go belly up,&quot; he added.    John Spears, a Tulsa consultant to oil-service companies, agreed that the court's ruling won't much affect the company's dealings with suppliers and contractors. &quot;This isn't nearly as bad for Texaco or its vendors as last year's fall in oil prices,&quot; Mr. Spears said.    The 1985 judgment continues to restrict Texaco's financial flexibility, but bankers close to the company said that yesterday's court ruling won't alter their dealings with Texaco. They indicated that they expect the case to be appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court.    The Texas court's ruling was about what oil analysts had expected, and it strengthened their conviction that it may force the companies back to the bargaining table. &quot;I don't know how much of this is a game, but we seem to be in a never-never land,&quot; said Bernard Weinstein, director of the Center for Enterprising at Southern Methodist University. &quot;Obviously, there is no way Texaco can borrow or pay $9 billion.&quot;    The court departed from its usual practice of publishing opinions on Thursday mornings, choosing instead to release the ruling after the market closed yesterday. In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Texaco's shares fell 75 cents, to $38.50, while Pennzoil's fell $1, to $71.    Even before yesterday's decision, Texaco's stock had been the most depressed among the shares of major oil companies, selling at the lowest price/earnings multiple and biggest discount to its underlying value. Thus the decision once again aroused speculation that Texaco could become the target of a takeover by anyone willing to risk assuming the liability to Pennzoil. Speculation also has been rife that Pennzoil may be willing to sell itself or many of its assets to Texaco at a premium price as a means of settling the case.    An executive at one major oil company privately has expressed that company's interest in acquiring Texaco, but only after it disposes of the &quot;Pennzoil problem.&quot; And Prudential-Bache's Mr. Edgar says that T. Boone Pickens, general partner of Mesa Limited Partnership and a noted takeover specialist, recently withdrew from a battle with Diamond Shamrock Corp. -- and soon may resume his search for undervalued companies to acquire.    &quot;Where does he go from there?&quot; Mr. Edgar asked. &quot;The greatest potential target is Texaco.&quot;    In its 162-page opinion, the appeals-court panel went out of its way to avoid second-guessing the Houston jury that awarded the verdict. The court took note, for instance, of the possibly severe economic repercussions on Texaco, but added: &quot;We are not authorized by law to substitute our judgment for that of the jury.&quot;    Written by Justice James F. Warren, the moderately phrased opinion rebutted 89 of the 90 points of error by the trial court that Texaco alleged in its appeal. The only exception was the amount of punitive damages, $1 billion of which, the opinion stated, was &quot;sufficient to satisfy any reason for their being awarded.&quot;    Nevertheless, an award of damages was appropriate, the opinion said, noting, &quot;The evidence shows that the wrongful conduct&quot; -- Texaco's alleged interference with Pennzoil's merger contract -- &quot;came not from servants or middle-level employees but from top-level management.&quot;    The court also embraced Pennzoil's blow-by-blow recitation of the events leading to Texaco's takeover of Getty Oil after Pennzoil had made its own deal.    In January 1984, Pennzoil and Getty Oil said they had agreed in principle to merge, giving Pennzoil an opportunity to join the ranks of major oil companies. But before final documents could be completed, Texaco offered a higher price, and Getty's board readily accepted. Pennzoil sued, alleging that Texaco had induced Getty Oil to break its merger contract with Pennzoil by, among other things, agreeing to hold the major shareholders of Getty Oil harmless against a breach-of-contract suit from Pennzoil.    The huge amount of damages was based on Pennzoil's assertion that $7.53 billion would be needed to drill for as much oil as it would have acquired in the deal with Getty. Texaco never offered evidence contesting the figure.    Among other things, the opinion asserted that the existence of a contract depends on the intent of the parties, and that the jury could have reasonably found it was Getty Oil's intention to be bound to Pennzoil.    And despite Texaco's claim that the jury improperly used the verdict to &quot;send a message&quot; to corporate America, the appeals court stated that the damages &quot;were not the result of mere passion, prejudice or improper motive.&quot;    The court also found that Texaco failed to prove that it had been denied a fair trial, even though Pennzoil's Mr. Jamail had contributed $10,000 to the reelection campaign of one of the judges in the case, the late Anthony J.P. Farris. &quot;There is no evidence in the record,&quot; the opinion said, &quot;that Judge Farris was either biased or prejudiced in any manner.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
