Sevin and Ben Rosen. In 1982, their venture-capital fund bankrolled Compaq Computer Corp. with $2.5 million. Two years later, when Compaq went public, their stock was valued at $38 million; today it would be worth $310 million -- 124 times the original investment.    But don't ask them to finance computer companies today. The business is saturated. Says Mr. Rosen: &quot;In terms of mainline, hard-core computer companies, it's very hard to define an area where you can get to a critical mass of $50 million to $100 million&quot; in sales. Short of that size, the chances of taking a hardware company public and realizing big returns are slim.    Many other computer-industry veterans also are sadly concluding that the heyday of the start-up is over. &quot;It may not be possible to start a new computer-manufacturing company,&quot; says Richard Shaffer, publisher of Technologic Computer Letter.    Soaring capital costs favor established companies. Low stock valuations hamper initial public offerings. And the move to standard operating systems and microprocessors limits the technological lead that any hardware company can seize from competitors.    &quot;Computers are a mature industry now,&quot; says Stephen Piper of Venture Economics, a Needham, Mass., company that tracks the venture-capital industry. &quot;Venture capitalists look for an industry that is growing rapidly and isn't dominated by existing players.&quot; Venture Economics calculates that the percentage of venture capital devoted to computer hardware has slid steadily from 33% in 1983 to 13% last year even though venture-capital investment has remained at about $3 billion a year.    Some entrepreneurs and investors aren't about to give up on hardware, however. Steve Jobs, the dismissed founder of Apple Computer Inc., is one. His well-financed Next Inc. will finally start selling computers with complete operating systems this month. In any event, the computer revolution is far from over; big advances in hardware are coming from established American and Japanese companies. And some investors predict explosive growth for new firms making pocket computers, servers for personal-computer networks and image-management systems.    But even the optimists are cautious. Michelle Preston, a veteran personal-computer analyst at Salomon Bros., says, &quot;It's a lot harder to start up today -- by orders of magnitude.&quot;    This shift apparently closes a dramatic chapter in the history of capitalism.    In the 32 years since a $70,000 venture-capital investment launched Digital Equipment Corp., hundreds of electronics pioneers have started computer-hardware companies. More than a dozen of the startups have turned into Fortune 500 companies. Names such as Apple Computer, Sun Microsystems Inc. and Intel Corp. have become famous. Their innovations include the minicomputer, the personal computer, the workstation and the microprocessor. They have created hundreds of thousands of jobs. For a brief period, they turned techie nerds into folk heroes and, sometimes, multimillionaires. Their sagas are frequently cited to justify a reduction in the capital-gains tax.    But over the past five years, venture capitalists have been chastened by large losses on an estimated $500 million invested in a dozen now-unsuccessful makers of minisupercomputers -- cheaper versions of the most powerful scientific computers.    Investors who once eagerly sought computer-related initial public offerings of stock have watched in horror as soaring companies suddenly spiraled downward. For example, Symbolics Inc., a Cambridge, Mass., maker of artificial-intelligence computers, was a hot stock after going public in 1984 at $6 a share. The issue hit a high of $15.25 in 1986, when revenue surged 70% to $114.6 million. But after three years of restructuring and huge losses, a scaled-down Symbolics recently returned to profitability on $67 million of annual sales. Its stock has languished below $2.50 for two years.    In the wake of such disappointments, investors are rejecting stocks in hardware start-ups, and that bodes ill for innovative entrepreneurs. With venture capitalists withdrawing, big Japanese electronics companies often move in, providing cheap capital and ending up owning a start-up's technology.    Instead of making big bets on a few hardware companies, venture capitalists are making smaller investments in computer-software companies, communications and networking concerns, medical technology, biotechnology and even consumer goods. &quot;We're all dancing around the periphery looking for niche opportunities,&quot; Mr. Rosen says. Other venture capitalists are putting money into corporate restructurings and leveraged buy-outs.    Many venture capitalists were shaken last week when two of the best-financed and most promising start-ups in history -- archrivals Ardent Computer Corp. and Stellar Computer Inc. -- decided to merge in a shotgun wedding orchestrated by one of Stellar's investors.    The two companies seemed to have everything going for them. Founded within weeks of each other by entrepreneurs who had each built big companies in the past, they make graphics workstations designed to be far better at showing animated computer simulations for scientists and engineers than anything available. Stellar raised $60 million over three years. Ardent, backed by its 44% owner, Kubota Ltd. of Japan, raised $108 million.    But each fell a year behind schedule in introducing its first computer. Because of the big design team and the cost of sophisticated computerized-design equipment, Stellar burned through as much as $2 million a month, without any offsetting revenue. When the two companies' products finally hit the market early last year, established companies had started to bring out similar products. And the two companies' own competition sparked costly price wars. But combined, they may still prosper, analysts say.    Even so, making the planned new company, called Stardent Inc., a profitable investment remains a long shot. Combined, the companies will still be fighting a market war with rivals, losing money and facing a difficult period of melding their operations. A stock offering is years away. Investment bankers say Stardent would have to be profitable with sales well in excess of $600 million to give investors a profit. This year, combined sales will reach $40 million, the companies' executives say.    For some of the venture capitalists involved, the merger was a painful lesson. &quot;One of the saddest days of my venture career was voting to merge Stellar and Ardent,&quot; says Russell Planitzer, a partner in J.H. Whitney andamp; Co., a venture-capital firm, and a director of Stellar. Mr. Planitzer concludes that starting new hardware companies has become too expensive for venture capitalists: &quot;The thing about venture capital is, when you start out {investing} a large amount of money, it's hard to make a large amount.&quot;    Echoes Stephen Gaal, a partner with TA Associates, a big Boston firm: &quot;It's a $50 million bill to find out if anybody cares. You have to build an awfully big company to get a reasonable return.&quot;    Such investments are risked more easily by large companies, such as International Business Machines Corp. and Apple, that can subsidize research and development out of profits from older lines. Moreover, improvements in computer technology seem sufficiently predictable that big companies are jumping on trends almost as fast as small ones are. Once, computer generations lasted four or five years, giving a company that leapfrogged competitors time to solidify its lead. Today, companies such as Digital Equipment are replacing product lines every 18 months. The computer industry's move to standard parts in the early 1980s helped new companies, such as Compaq and Sun, that took customers away from established companies with proprietary systems. But today, those standards limit the amount of innovation that small companies can provide. &quot;Given that you'll have one of five {microprocessor} chips, and one of three operating systems, it's hard to see that there will be any niche that goes unserved by existing hardware companies,&quot; says John Bayless, managing partner of SRB Partners Fund in Dallas. &quot;Customers are buying on 'warm fuzzies,' like sales and service.&quot;    Other factors also aid existing companies. Although the computer market is much larger than it was 10 years ago, most customers now have settled on computer lines to use in obvious applications. &quot;There's no more low-hanging fruit,&quot; says Aaron Goldberg, an analyst at International Data Corp., a Framingham, Mass., market researcher.    And customers are replacing installed machines slowly. Mr. Goldberg says one client with 2,500 personal computers told him that even if cost weren't a problem, it would take 1 1/2 years to upgrade to more advanced IBM models.    In the PC world, the crowding on retailers' shelves is already making life tough for new entrants. The last PC company to achieve the size and profits to go public was a mail-order marketer, Dell Computer Co., last year.    The computer industry will still spawn a few more additions to the Fortune 500, analysts predict. Among public companies, Stratus Computer Inc., a nine-year-old Marlboro, Mass., maker of computers that keep running even if some parts fail, had $265 million in sales last year and is growing 40% annually.    Among closely held firms, five-year-old Mips Computer Systems Inc., of Sunnyvale, Calif., expects revenue to rise to $100 million this year from $39 million last year. Mips, which relies on 20%-owner Kubota for much of its manufacturing, has avoided big capital investments. Moreover, partners such as Digital Equipment buy and resell its designs and workstations. &quot;I don't think the world is looking for another 1,000-person sales force or another semiconductor manufacturer,&quot; says Charles Boesenberg, the vice president for marketing. Many investment bankers are eagerly awaiting Mips's initial public offering.    If new hardware firms do have a chance anywhere, it is making specialized servers for computer networks. Such servers can be used to store files, distribute information, handle images and communicate with other computers. One that is highly touted is NetFrame Systems, of Sunnyvale, Calif., which has raised some $17 million and has been promised shelf space by Businessland Inc.    The biggest gamble in the hardware area now is Mr. Jobs's Next Inc. It is heavily bankrolled by such investors as H. Ross Perot and Japan's Canon Inc., which bought 16% of Next for a whopping $100 million last spring. Businessland, the company's sole distributor, expects to sell $100 million worth of Next computers in the first year.    But the Next computers are just coming to market, and other companies are racing to incorporate their best features. Last spring, a survey of high-tech investors and entrepreneurs at a Technologic Partners conference found a majority predicting Next would never achieve $500 million in annual revenue.    With investors continuing to provide money to the big venture-capital funds, venture capitalists are expanding their purview. Mr. Gaal says TA Associates has recently started a &quot;program of management buy-outs of growth companies on a slightly leveraged basis.&quot;    J.H. Whitney, the nation's oldest venture-capital company, has gone further. Mr. Planitzer estimates that most of its investment dollars and about half the partners' time now go into leveraged buy-outs. Whitney recently completed the $1.3 billion buy-out of Prime Computer Inc., which was founded as a venture-capital-backed minicomputer maker in 1972. Mr. Planitzer is serving as Prime's new chairman. </TEXT></DOC>
