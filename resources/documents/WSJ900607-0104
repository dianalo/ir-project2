Opponents of a proposed $200 million observatoryon Mount Graham claim that its construction threatens theexistence of the Mount Graham red squirrel, which lives onlyat the summit of this mountain. The diminutive squirrels,totaling slightly more than 100 in number, were listed asendangered in 1987 under the Endangered Species Act. They arebeing used in an attempt to halt this project, just as thesnail darter, the northern spotted owl, and the dusky seasidesparrow have been used to interfere with previousconstruction or resource-use decisions.   Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan recently questionedwhether the interference on behalf of a single species isworth the cost, and suggested that Congress considerincreasing the flexibility of the Endangered Species Act. Hisremarks, which included the statement, &quot;Nobody's told me thedifference between a red squirrel, a black one or a brownone,&quot; may not earn high marks from environmental groups. Butthey make considerable sense to much of the scientificcommunity.</LP><TEXT>   The view that the loss of a single species can havedisastrous consequences represents a misguided notion aboutthe significance of individual animal or plant categories.The Endangered Species Act assumes that preserving onespecies has enormous value or benefit. But this assumption isnot warranted.   Suppose we lost a species. How devastating would that be?&quot;Mass extinctions have been recorded since the dawn ofpaleontology,&quot; writes Harvard paleontologist Stephen Gould.These evolutionary disruptions delineated the majorboundaries of geologic time. The most severe of theseoccurred approximately 250 million years ago, at the end ofthe Permian Period, with an estimated 96% extinction ofspecies, says Mr. Gould. The cause of these extinctions isuncertain, but possibilities include global cooling,radiation and sea-level fluctuations. There is generalagreement among scientists that today's species represent asmall proportion of all those that have ever existed --probably less than 1%. This means that more than 99% of allspecies ever living have become extinct.   Yet, in spite of these extinctions, both Mr. Gould andUniversity of Chicago paleontologist Jack Sepkoski say thatthe actual number of living species has probably increasedover time. The &quot;niches&quot; created by extinctions provide anopportunity for a vigorous development of new species, aprocess called speciation. Periods of mass extinctions havebeen followed by increases in the number of species, as whensmall mammals expanded rapidly after dinosaurs disappeared.   Thus, evolutionary history appears to have beencharacterized by millions of species extinctions andsubsequent increases in species numbers. Indeed, byattempting to preserve species living on the brink ofextinction, we may be wasting time, effort and money onanimals that will disappear over time regardless of ourefforts.   Advocates of preservation often contend that the processof evolution has endowed each species with a geneticaccumulation of characteristics that enhance its chances ofsurvival. If a species becomes extinct, this genetic historydisappears forever and cannot be passed along to futurespecies. The loss of any single species detracts from thegenetic pool, this argument goes, and reduces the range ofpossibilities for future adaptation.   But Mr. Gould challenges this view. In his book &quot;WonderfulLife&quot; he writes that traits that enhance survival &quot;do so inways that are incidental and unrelated to the causes of theirevolution in the first place. . . . A trait with no previoussignificance, one that had just hitchhiked along for thedevelopmental ride as a side consequence of anotheradaptation, may now hold the key to your survival.&quot;   In other words, traits that have helped a species survivein the past are not particularly important to the futuresurvival of that species or to its offshoots. The evolvedsurvival traits of an endangered species are no more valuablethan the traits of the new species that will eventuallyevolve after its extinction. Preserving a species will notnecessarily increase the survival chances of futuregenerations.   Why, then, are environmentalists so concerned with strictenforcement of the Endangered Species Act? The answer is thatsaving species is often a subterfuge for achieving othergoals, such as the prevention of development. When the SierraClub's Legal Defense Fund attempted to delay a federal saleof old-growth timber in the Pacific Northwest, Andy Stahl,one of its analysts, made this fact quite clear. He calledthe northern spotted owl &quot;the wildlife species of choice toact as a surrogate for old-growth protection, and I've oftenthought that thank goodness the spotted owl evolved in theNorthwest, for if it hadn't we'd have to genetically engineerit . . . we can use it to protect a lot of old-growth.&quot;Evidently, Mr. Stahl is more concerned with old-growth timberthan with the spotted owl.   Opinion is divided on whether the Mount Graham redsquirrel will actually become extinct if the observatory isbuilt; some say that the squirrel will have no troubleexisting in the thousands of acres of nearby coniferousforests. But even if we lose this small population, we canrest assured that the consequence will not be evolutionaryArmageddon. Whether the telescope should be built is aquestion to be decided by careful weighing of costs andbenefits by the owners and developers. They should considerthe potential loss of the squirrel as a possible cost, butnot measure it as a disaster.   ---   Mr. Copeland is executive director of the PoliticalEconomy Research Center in Bozeman, Mont.</TEXT></DOC>
