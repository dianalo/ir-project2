Officials at the White House and State Department say no dealswill be negotiated with Iran and that the U.S. government willdiscuss the hostage situation only with ``authoritative''representatives of the Tehran government.   Neither of these limitations was placed on the jockeying in1985-86 that led to the clandestine sales of U.S. arms to Iran, thediversion of proceeds to Nicaraguan rebels and the subsequentindictment of two onetime White House officials.   However, two American hostages _ David Jacobsen and the Rev.Benjamin Weir _ were released during that mercurial period.   President Reagan subsequently argued that he was merely seekingan opening to Iran, not an arms-for-hostages trade, when heapproved the transfer of TOW anti-tank and anti-aircraft missilesto Tehran.   A presidential panel disagreed with him, and so did a jointcongressional investigative committee.   Reagan eventually acknowledged that what had started out as anoverture to moderate political elements in Iran had turned intowhat the public perceived as an arms-for-hostages swap.   Iran's acceptance last week of a U.N. resolution imposing acease-fire in the long war with Iraq has raised expectations of animproved climate for getting the hostages out of Lebanon.   When asked Monday if the time was ripe to try once again to talkto the Iranians about the hostages, Reagan said of the Iranianofficials: ``If they're ready and willing to talk, it's time.''   But administration officials followed that broad-brush remarkwith a series of statements stressing limitations on U.S.willingness to deal with Iran on this subject. They said theadministration would not again fall prey to something that can beconstrued as bargaining with a terrorist nation for the release ofhostages.   So, the guidance that administration officials gave out forpublic consumption was that they would not go to any length to getthe hostages out.   But the administration previously had denied certain aspects ofthe 1985-86 initiative, and was proved wrong.   Reagan, for instance, sent an amended statement to the Towerreview board about how the initial missile shipments had beenapproved by him.   While steadfastly insisting that officials are doing all theycan to learn the whereabouts of the nine Americans and get themout, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater sought Wednesday tominimize the significance of statements from Iran suggesting a newinterest in the issue.   In so doing, he set forth another ground rule limiting U.S.diplomatic flexibility: an insistence that the U.S. government havedirect communication from Tehran or an authoritative sourcespeaking for the government of revolutionary leader, the AyatollahRuhollah Khomeini.   If Iran wants to talk to the United States, the spokesman said,its leaders must back up statements in speeches with``authoritative communications'' to the United States.   Fitzwater left no doubt that the uproar over earlier U.S.dealings on hostages has made U.S. officials more wary _ and evencautious _ than before.   ``One of the lessons we learned from that experience(Iran-Contra) is that it's very difficult to have those kinds ofdiscussions without them becoming arms for hostages or ransom forhostages or negotiations for hostages,'' the spokesman said.   ``And that's why we're not going to do it again.''   As if to prove his point, Fitzwater scoffed at statements byIran's Parliament speaker, Hojatolislam Hashemi Rafsanjani,indicating an interest in warming relations with Washington andsuggesting a willingness to deal on the hostages.   ``We frankly don't know what they're trying to say,'' Fitzwatersaid. ``It their pattern to make these kinds of claims and hopesomebody bites, and you will recall we went through this a yearago.''   ``My scars are deep enough, I do not forget thoseconversations,'' said Fitzwater, who bore the brunt of reporters'questions after the Iran-Contra affair was exposed in November 1986.   The release of 52 American hostages from Iran in early 1981 wasbrought about, at least in part, by a U.S. deal to turn over to aninternational tribunal at least $3 billion in frozen Iranian assets.   Reagan signed an executive order seeking to enforce the assetsagreement that then-President Jimmy Carter made with Iran, althoughofficials of the new administration said they would not have signedsuch an agreement.   Asked Wednesday if the administration was ruling out just suchan arrangement, Fitzwater said, ``We don't link assets to hostages,and no deals.''   The State Department spokesman, Charles E. Redman, said freeingthe nine hostages was not subject to bartering with Iran overfrozen assets.   ``This is a proposal that has been surfaced and resurfaced manytimes over the past two years, and each time we have noted thatthere can be no connection between the hostages and Iran's claim in(International Claims Tribunal) The Hague,'' Redman said.   Fitzwater bristled when asked whether the hostages had become``the forgotten men.''   ``No, we've been talking about them every day for a week,'' hesaid, referring to his give-and-take with reporters during WhiteHouse news briefings.</TEXT><HEAD>___</HEAD><HEAD>EDITOR'S NOTE: Merrill Hartson covers the White House for The</HEAD><TEXT>   Associated Press.</TEXT></DOC>
