But CRS Sirrine Inc. could change all that.    The Houston-based architectural and engineering concern formed a limited partnership earlier this month to develop a process that uses the crystalline compound to control pollutants associated with acid rain. The potential significance of this technology appears to have eluded most investors who follow Sirrine, a conservative, well-respected company.    Sirrine's partner in the venture is Chicago-based Industrial Resources Inc., an over-the-counter company that has practically no sales or operations. What it does have, though, is federal leases to acres of nahcolyte, a minable, naturally occurring form of sodium bicarbonate that apparently helps remove sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide from coal-fired electric power plants. Profit from the partnership, known as NaTec Ltd., will be split 50-50.    Some analysts question whether the new technology ever will add enough to Sirrine's revenue to affect the bottom line. &quot;The nature of the whole thing is not clear,&quot; says Wayne Johnson, who follows Sirrine for H.G. Wellington andamp; Co.    Also, Sirrine's stock price already has gone up significantly since the beginning of the year, making it uncertain whether the issue is ready to pop again. And there are logistical concerns, too, such as whether NaTec can move nahcolyte cost-efficiently from its Colorado mines to meet a large customer base in the East.    Still, in many ways, NaTec's timing couldn't be better, with strict acid-rain legislation looming in Congress. While it is doubtful that new anti-pollution laws will be passed this session, recent maneuverings on Capitol Hill make it apparent that the Clean Air Act isn't far from being overhauled. &quot;Am I worried?&quot; says one Midwestern utility executive. &quot;Hell, yes.&quot;    NaTec could be well poised to alleviate those fears. Perhaps the most striking thing about the partnership is how far along it is in developing its technology, which falls under the general rubric of &quot;clean coal.&quot;    Paul D. Hemphill, Sirrine's director of technical services, says full-scale testing of the process already has been conducted on a power plant -- though he won't identify it -- and he maintains that it worked extremely well. So far, he says, &quot;four or five&quot; companies have expressed interest in trying the technology, and negotiations with them are under way.    Several analysts note that they didn't pay much attention to the nahcolyte announcement, because of the esoteric nature of smokestack technology. &quot;I don't think people understand it,&quot; says one.    For months, Sirrine's stock price has itself been rising like smoke, drifting from a January high of only 12 1/2 to a June high of 23 1/4. It has fallen lately to about 21, and finished yesterday at 21 1/2, unchanged. Analysts attribute the jump to favorable earnings in recent quarters and the general recovery of the engineering and construction industry, which has only recently emerged from the throes of recession.    Robert Porter, a U.S. Department of Energy official who keeps a close eye on clean coal, says most of the projects with which he is familiar &quot;are not as far along&quot; as NaTec's. Many, in fact, are still grounded in the laboratory.    The most advanced, including efforts by Dravo Corp., closely held Bechtel Group Inc. and General Electric Co., are still conducting initial tests. In addition, McDermott International Inc.'s Babcock andamp; Wilcox Co. unit is ready to begin trying a full-scale, clean-coal technology similar to NaTec's later this year.    NaTec's results, on the other hand, already sound promising. Serrine's Mr. Hemphill says the nahcolyte method abates 90% of the sulfur dioxide emitted from a plant and 40% of the nitrogen oxide -- likely to be well within parameters that any new acid-rain legislation would set.    Independent specialists, in fact, contend such numbers are much better than those boasted of by nearly all pollution-control technologies that, like NaTec's, involve in-duct injection. In-duct means that the controlling agent -- usually limestone, in this case nahcolyte -- is put in the plant's smokestack system; there, it mixes with the gaseous pollutants and turns them to solids, so they can be trapped.    The only fully tested technology that appears as reliable as NaTec's is a wet-scrubber system, but at an installation cost of $100 million or so, this is prohibitively expensive for most utilities. Applying NaTec's technology would, by comparison, cost about $10 million for an average plant.    Nahcolyte, Mr. Hemphill points out, &quot;is not gold or uranium.&quot; The stuff, nonetheless, could one day mean big revenue and good profit margins for a sleepy company.    ---   CRS Sirrine   (NYSE; Symbol: CRX) -   Business: Architectural and engineering services   Year ended June 30, 1987:   Revenue: $332.1 million   Net loss: $32.4 million*   Third quarter, March 31, 1988:   Net income: $2 million; or 33 cents a share vs. loss: $36.2 million*   Average daily trading volume: 11,780 shares   Common shares outstanding: 6.4 million   *1987 loss figures include a pretax write-off of about $43 million related to restructuring costs   Note: Stock prices reflect a 3-for-2 stock split paid in August 1987</TEXT></DOC>
