The private consortium British Satellite Broadcasting Ltd., using a Hughes Aircraft Co. satellite, aims to beam five channels of movies, sports, entertainment and news shows straight into U.K. homes, starting next spring. But the brave new technology, called &quot;direct-to-home&quot; TV, already is stumbling in Britain and the rest of Europe, a victim of high costs, equipment problems and political wrangling.    Early forecasts that more than nine million European households would have receiving dishes to get satellite television by 1993 now seem wildly optimistic. The actual number probably will be no more than five million, industry specialists say. And to reap pie from the sky, Europe's dozen public and private direct satellite broadcasters may have to shell out $5 billion to $10 billion in addition to the $2.5 billion they have spent so far.    Only the richest will survive. &quot;It will be a long, slow haul to make direct-to-home {broadcasting} a paying business in Europe,&quot; says Jill Maslen, research director for CIT Research Ltd., a London market-research firm. Eventually, she adds, there will be &quot;just a few operators left making a horrible living.&quot;    World-wide, the expensive technology has yet to attract legions of consumers despite a decade of development. Satellite TV enjoys limited success in Japan, where about 789,000 homes receive two channels directly. But almost all signed up before NHK, the nation's public broadcaster, started charging a fee this month. In the U.S., satellite broadcasting serves less than two million of the 90 million homes with TV sets. It was overtaken by the much wider popularity of cable television.    In Europe, a French satellite recently began airing cultural shows over one of its five channels, but dishes are scarce and few people watch. The West German government launched a broadcast satellite Aug. 8 to replace one abandoned in November 1987 after the solar panels failed to open. But the new satellite may not lure many viewers until high-definition television arrives in 1994.    Scandinavia's Tele-X satellite went up in April, three years behind schedule. The venture, once awaited with great anticipation but now widely dismissed as a $264 million white elephant, also won't begin broadcasting soon because of political squabbles over introducing commercial and pay television.    Britain has witnessed the biggest skirmishes and missteps in Europe's sky war over satellite TV. Both Rupert Murdoch's Sky Television, a unit of Australia's News Corp., and British Satellite, backed by several Murdoch rivals, are bleeding badly. They stabbed themselves and each other through confusing promotions of their different technologies and the committal of nearly $1 billion in a bidding contest for Hollywood film rights.    Mr. Murdoch, who began beaming TV signals to homes in Britain and Ireland in February, expects to spend #500 million ($780 million) before he breaks even in three to five years. British Satellite, after raising #423.5 million, needs to find another #300 million to #400 million early next year. Both risky ventures may fizzle by &quot;never getting to a big enough critical mass to make money,&quot; warns Nick Lovegrove, a London-based senior manager for U.S. consultants McKinsey andamp; Co.    So far, only 227,000 households receive Sky TV's four channels, either directly or through cable TV systems -- despite its initial projections of reaching 2.5 million homes by year end. Mr. Murdoch is employing desperate tactics to prop up his unprofitable operation. Among them: running commercials on the pay-TV movie channel, postponing the addition of a fifth channel and distributing thousands of receiving dishes free or at a discount through Murdoch tabloid newspapers.    Next week, Sky TV will begin offering a cut-rate rental package as part of its latest #10 million marketing campaign. The venture is expected to buy 300,000 dishes, which retail for #199 each, and charge viewers #4.45 a week for dish installation, rental and the descrambling equipment and fees for its pay-television channel. By simplifying things for consumers, the rental package &quot;could have a tremendous effect&quot; on boosting the appeal of Sky TV, says John Clemens, managing director of Kennington Research, London market researchers.    The new Sky TV drive undoubtedly will exacerbate British Satellite's difficulties. The consortium suffered an embarrassing and costly setback in May when a technical hitch in developing descrambling equipment forced a six-month postponement of its September debut. It had to temporarily shelve a #20 million advertising campaign, after spending #2.5 million urging British viewers to buy their dishes this fall. The consortium then trumpeted -- but since has quietly dropped -- plans for an interim &quot;showcase service&quot; of one free channel in U.K. pubs and clubs.    &quot;Our problem is getting this very, very advanced technology to actually work,&quot; says Anthony Simonds-Gooding, British Satellite's chief executive officer. &quot;Our credibility is close to zero until&quot; then. Some analysts take a harsher view. &quot;There is a serious question mark over BSB management,&quot; says Mark Astaire, a media analyst at U.K. brokers Hoare Govett Ltd. &quot;So far, everything has gone wrong.&quot;    Making matters worse are the misfortunes of British Satellite's biggest investor, Australian entrepreneur Alan Bond. Broadcast regulators in his native country have declared him unfit to operate television and radio stations there after finding that he misled regulators and made an improper payment to a politician in connection with a defamation case against one of his stations. With his global corporate empire facing a cash squeeze, Mr. Bond has yet to pay the latest #27 million portion of his #153 million commitment to British Satellite. The consortium's nine other investors paid their installments in June.    Bond Corp. Holdings would like to pull out of the venture, analysts believe, perhaps by selling its nearly 36% stake to Hollywood studios. Unfortunately, &quot;this (holding) isn't a particularly sellable asset at the moment,&quot; observes a Bond Corp. executive based in London.    Other British Satellite shareholders are growing nervous about Mr. Bond's uncertain role and the venture's possible need for several hundred million pounds more after next year's round of financing. Among the consortium's backers: international publishing giants Pearson PLC and Reed International PLC, as well as Granada Group PLC, a consumer-electronics rental and retail concern.    Some British Satellite investors would would prefer that the consortium end Britain's costly satellite-TV battle through a partial merger with Sky TV. &quot;If the two companies could work out a way of doing that, it would be of great advantage,&quot; one backer says. The rivals could use Sky TV's satellite system and share pay-TV channels, suggests James Lee, a Boston Consulting Group consultant in London. &quot;I am almost certain that the time will come when they are going to have to bury the hatchet and try to resolve their differences,&quot; Mr. Lee says.    But such a marriage doesn't appear imminent. Either the two rivals merge now, says Mr. Simonds-Gooding, British Satellite's chief executive, &quot;or they slug it out in the market and one goes bust later. I think it's going to be a fight out in the marketplace.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
