Gregor Gysi, East Germany's new Communist Party chief, said hewants a clear separation of party and government functions, aradical concept in a country where the party has been all-powerfulfor 40 years.   In another development, the four World War II Allies _ France,Britain, the United States and the Soviet Union _ announced theywould meet Monday to discuss the role of Berlin in East-Westaffairs.   Tens of thousands of East Germans took to the streets indemonstrations in Rostock, Erfurt and six other cities, theofficial news agency ADN said. The protesters were demandingdemocratic reforms and respect for human rights, the agency said.   In the southern city of Plauen, about 15,000 demonstratorsturned out for a pro-democracy rally called by the New Forumopposition group.   Several hundred people in East Berlin demonstrated for humanrights and against what they see as growing intolerance offoreigners.   Hartmut Krausse, a member of New Forum, told 15,000 people inthe southern city of Ilmenau that talk of ``anarchy, chaos andviolence'' was out of place.   ``Rather, we should be talking about democratic reform on thebasis of new elections,'' Krausse told the cheering crowd.   In the face of such protests, the Communist Party has ousted itshard-line leaders, lifted travel restrictions, opened the BerlinWall and abandoned its constitutionally guaranteed hold on power _all in the last three months.   Leaders of the 160,000-member scientists' union, meeting onSaturday in Leipzig, issued the call for recognition of the rightto strike, ADN said.   The scientists' union is one of 16 unions belonging to thestate-run labor federation Freier Deutsche Gewerskschaftsbund.   The scientists' call amounts to a demand for the federationleadership to recognize the right to strike embodied in the EastGerman Constitution.   Since 1949, the 8.6-million member federation has rejected theright to strike, arguing that since the nation's businesses are``owned by the people,'' any strike would be against the peoplethemselves.   The federation has been rocked by a growing financial scandal,and a new leadership took over Saturday to make it more independent.   The prospect of strikes clearly alarmed Gysi, 41, who took overas party chief only on Saturday. In an interview broadcast lateSaturday night on West Germany's ADR television network, he saidthat given the country's current political instability strikeswould be ``irresponsible.''   Gysi spent Sunday preparing for next weekend's continuation ofthe emergency party congress that is expected to give the party anew name.   Late Sunday, the official news agency ADN said Soviet PresidentMikhail S. Gorbachev had sent Gysi a message of congratulationsthat also emphasized the ``sovereign'' nature of East Germany.Gorbachev, whose Soviet reform movement prompted the pro-democracyrevolution in the East bloc, recently joined with East Germanleaders in rejecting German reunification, a possibility that hasbeen debated since the reform movement began transforming EastGermany.   East Germany faces its first free elections in May, and partyleaders have said they would be happy to receive 20 percent of thevote.   In the interview, Gysi said he was urging a ``strict division ofparty and government.'' But he added, ``This can't be done in oneday. It is a long-term job that is being taken very seriously.''   Such separation would be a striking change in East Germanywhere, despite recent democratic reforms, party members still holdmost of the important positions in the country.   The government already has begun stripping some of theCommunists' influence. For example, it disarmed the party's privatemilitia that had been based in the nation's factories. But thegovernment would have to assert itself much more to be consideredan equal player with the Communist Party.   The Communists also say they see themselves as one party amongseveral political forces in East Germany, following two months ofupheaval that started with the downfall of hard-line ruler ErichHonecker.   Last week, reformist Mayor Wolfgang Berghofer of Dresden saidthe nation's factories have been hit by politically motivatedwarning strikes, aimed against Communist Party interference.Berghofer said the unrest could get out of hand and escalate intoviolence.   On Sunday, he warned that trouble could come from both theextreme right and the extreme left in East Germany. ``Violence hasnot been dispelled,'' he told reporters. ``An escalation ispossible at any moment.''   West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher, in a speechSunday in Saarbruecken, urged East Germans to maintain their``responsibility and restraint.'' He said, ``Keep your protests andefforts violence-free.''   There have been increasing reports of tensions in East Germany,as many people joined the hunt to root out corruption, especiallyamong the ousted and disgraced members of the Communist Party.</TEXT></DOC>
