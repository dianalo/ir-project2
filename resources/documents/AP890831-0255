Jack N. Polevoi of Woodland Hills, Calif., a former ZZZZ Bestvice president, is serving an 18-month prison sentence afterpleading guilty in June to four counts of stock and tax fraud andother violations.   The order for Polevoi to pay the nearly $900,000 came Wednesdayfrom U.S. District Judge Robert J. Kelleher. It was based onfindings that in mid-1987 Polevoi and his twin brother Jerry ordered54,200 shares of ZZZZ Best to be sold short.   Polevoi knew at the time that ZZZZ Best's founder and chairman,Barry M. Minkow, was considering resigning from the Reseda,Calif.-based company, which was crumbling.   When investors sell stock short, they seek to profit from adecline in the stock price by selling borrowed shares and buyingthem back later. ZZZZ Best shares fell from more than $5 each at thetime the short sales were made to 75 cents when Polevoi completedthe transactions.   Polevoi and others also laundered $712,000 in ZZZZ Best corporatefunds and bank loans through Las Vegas casinos in the days beforethe company collapsed.   Minkow, who convinced Wall Street and the public that he was ateen-age business genius, was convicted of 57 counts of fraud,conspiracy and other violations after investigators discovered thatmuch of the work supposedly done by ZZZZ Best existed only on paper.   Minkow is serving a 25-year prison term and has been ordered torepay $26 million in illegal profits and restitution.</TEXT></DOC>
