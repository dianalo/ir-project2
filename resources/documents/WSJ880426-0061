Reagan plans to veto the trade bill because it requires employers to tell shutdown plans 60 days early. Four states have notice laws; similar bills were offered in 12 more states this year. To stop such &quot;intrusion,&quot; more employers are giving longer notice, says Mark de Bernardo of the Chamber of Commerce. Firms providing such warnings include IBM, General Electric, General Motors, USX and Eastman Kodak.    Business groups exhort companies to give ample notice, as &quot;good business.&quot; Labor Secretary McLaughlin says government relocation aid is a notice incentive. But backers of the federal bill don't see a big notification rush. They cite a General Accounting Office study that said most workers get little warning.    Both sides agree that if a veto kills the plant-closing provision, the issue will be revived later.    ODER MANAGERS gain more favor, some employment experts say.    Challenger, Gray andamp; Christmas, a Chicago placement firm, says fired managers aged 50 and older now hunt only 15 days longer for a new job than younger ones do; the gap was nearly two months in early 1985. The older group may soon take less time than young workers, the firm says. Employers are placing more of a premium on experience, it says, and many companies prefer older managers because they aren't as likely to seek a new job elsewhere.    &quot;Pure demographics&quot; -- the aging work population -- will also force companies' hands, says Robert Slater, a Dallas placement man. The American Association of Retired Persons agrees that young workers will grow more scarce and older ones more in demand. But it says most employers so far want older people only for low-pay jobs.    HANGING TOGETHER: Labor-management cooperation spreads rapidly.    Closer ties boost Duriron Co.'s productivity 15% since October, giving the foundry its first profit since 1981. Cooperation must &quot;become a way of life for basic industry to survive,&quot; a manager says. A Dayton Power andamp; Light &quot;compact&quot; slashes grievances, disciplinary cases and accidents. Steelworkers Union and National Steel officials meet often to plot production gains.    New ways to boost productivity and save jobs often end labor strife. The Communications Workers and Ameritech share information; the Michigan Bell unit and the union experiment with joint labor-negotiation training. Williams Pipe Line managers and workers hold regular &quot;quality circle&quot; give-and-take sessions; rubbing shoulders helped combine jobs and expand worker skills.    But potential lost jobs from auto-parts productivity gains worry workers at Varlen Corp., and managers dislike reduced authority, an official says.    &quot;JUSTICE FOR JANITORS&quot; is the Service Employees union slogan, in a drive to organize cleaning crews and raise their pay. In July, the union will picket events planned by Atlanta developer John Portman, during the Democratic convention. The union says he blocks unionization of janitors.    ELECTION-YEAR hiring vigor returns. Fully 29% of more than 13,000 employers surveyed by Manpower Inc. will boost second-quarter employment and only 6% will cut. The pattern of two straight brisk quarters matches 1984, Mitchell Fromstein, Manpower president, says. Northeast hiring is the strongest in the survey's 12 years.    A HEALTH CARE TAX signed by Massachusetts Gov. Dukakis will boost zeal for a pending U.S. bill to require health benefits for employees, pre-empting the diverse actions by states, says Hewitt Associates, consultants. Bay State firms must pay as much as $1,680 a year for each of their workers without health insurance; the state will provide the insurance.    WOMEN ON THE JOB long for the family dinner, a survey of 4,530 career women by the magazine Working Woman shows. While 61% buy fancy takeout foods, half feel guilty that they don't cook and serve home meals to their families. Fully 81% of those with pre-adolescent children try to re-create the dinner table of their own youth.    SMOKING CURBS raise surprisingly little havoc, many bosses say.    New restrictions set by New York City haven't caused complaints at Manhattan Savings Bank. &quot;It's been coming for so long,&quot; says Margaret Howley, senior vice president, &quot;and people were psyched up for it.&quot; Stanley Works, in Connecticut, confines smoking to a small cafeteria area and a smokers' lounge, and says &quot;people respect the policy.&quot; Smokers don't mind stepping outside to smoke during their breaks, Douglas Aircraft Co. says.    Smokers enjoy &quot;slipping off to an empty room&quot; to smoke at North American Mortgage Co.'s Dallas office, an official says. Curbs at Northrop Corp.'s aircraft division sparked &quot;some complaints&quot; from smokers, yet they comply, a spokesman says. But nonsmokers still aren't satisfied with smoking limits at Adolph Coors Co.    Freddie Mac banned smoking on Friday, president Leland Brendsel's 46th birthday; he himself quit that day.    THE CHECKOFF: Bird's Florist in Washington honors National Secretaries Week with a Fawn Hall bouquet of flowers, complete with shredded &quot;documents.&quot; . . . Some 3,500 Harvard University clerical and technical workers will vote May 17 on becoming unionized. . . . Rochester Institute of Technology ends training for skilled jobs, as tuition climbs and pay eases. </TEXT></DOC>
