The panel of 13 economists sponsored by the Conference Boardprojected that real gross national product will rise about 2.5percent this year, down from about 2.7 percent in 1988.   The group also projected that inflation would rise to 5 percentfrom 4.2 percent, the prime interest rate would hold steady at about10.5 percent and unemployment would increase slightly to 5.5 percent.   ``Under present circumstances, a slowdown this year should belooked upon not as a signal of economic weakness but as anecessity,'' said Edgar R. Fiedler, economic counselor at theConference Board, a worldwide organization of corporate executives.   ``Faster growth of the economy would seriously heighten anxietyabout the financial markets, which in turn would be manifested inthe form of higher interest rates, more inflation and perhaps anearlier recession,'' he said.   The panel said the economic expansion of the last seven yearswill be fueled by capital spending and international trade. Spendingon plant equipment is projected to climb 6 percent to 7 perent, downfrom a 10 percent rise in 1988.   But members of the panel said they foresee no progress inreducing the federal budget deficit, instead projecting it willincrease to $158 billion in fiscal 1989, up from $155 billion.</TEXT></DOC>
