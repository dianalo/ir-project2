No pickup.</NOTE><BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE><TEXT>   The government today reported the lowest monthly trade deficitin nearly four years, inciting a hectic rally in the dollar, easinginterest rates in the credit markets and boosting the Republicanpresidential campaign.   The Commerce Department said the merchandise trade deficitshrank to $9.5 billion in July, the lowest monthly imbalance sinceDecember 1984 and substantially better than many economists hadpredicted.   The 28 percent improvement reflected a small increase in exportsand a big decline in imports.   It was certain to cheer Republican presidential candidate GeorgeBush, who has been trying to deflect charges from Democrat MichaelDukakis that the nation's soaring deficits reflect major flaws inthe Reagan economic program.   But the Commerce Department also revised upward its June deficitfigure to $13.2 billion from $12.5 billion, which would be thebiggest gap since the February shortfall of $14.4 billion.   Money traders scrambled to buy dollars after today's report wasreleased, sending the currency sharply higher in value against theWest German mark and Japanese yen.   In the bond market, a sensitive indicator of inflation and theeconomy's direction, the key 30-year Treasury bond rose more than$7.50 per $1,000 in face amount and its yield fell to 8.98 percentfrom 8.99 percent late Tuesday.   Bond traders were primarily reacting to the big shrinkage inimports, which suggested the economy may be slowing down andthereby easing fears of inflation.   The trade report was issued prior to the opening bell on WallStreet, but stock traders already had assumed there would be goodnews today and drove prices up late Tuesday, encouraged by remarksfrom Treasury secretary designate Nicholas F. Brady.   Brady told a Senate confirmation hearing that he expects thetrade deficit to decline at a ``surprisingly fast'' pace over thenext few years.   In addition, the Commerce Department said Tuesday that thedeficit in the current account, the broadest measure of U.S. trade,shrank to $33.3 billion in the second quarter, a 9.8 percentimprovement from a first quarter imbalance of $36.9 billion.   It was the biggest quarterly improvement since a 20.1 percentdrop in the final three months of last year. The current accountcovers trade in merchandise as well as trade in services, whichprimarily reflect the flow of investment earnings between countries.   In other markets Tuesday, oil prices advanced, driven by a risein wholesale gasoline prices, which soared on news that refineriesand oil platforms were threatened by a hurricane approaching theGulf of Mexico.   The contract for October delivery of West Texas Intermediate,the benchmark grade of U.S. crude, rose 7 cents to settle at $14.56a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.   Wholesale unleaded gasoline for October delivery closed up 1.19cents at 43.81 cents a gallon.   Elsewhere, the government released a state-by-state report onunemployment in which Vermont emerged as the best job provider forits residents. Massachusetts slipped from first place to 10th inthe past year among states with the lowest unemployment rates.   Vermont posted an unemployment rate of 2.3 percent in July, withjust 6,900 of its workers lacking jobs, the Bureau of LaborStatistics said.   Massachusetts' unemployment rate, meanwhile, rose to 3.6 percentin July, a full percentage point higher than the same month a yearago.</TEXT></DOC>
