Cases (126) were all maleswho died from lung cancer between 1976 and 1980. Controls (384) werea random sample of males dying from other causes during the same period.Jobs held during working life have been analyzed according to a listof occupations already known to be causally associated with lung cancer(list A) and a list of occupations suspected of being so (list B). Attributablerisk percentages in the population for occupations included in eitherlist A or B were about 36% and 12% in the 2 areas. Welders or workersin industries in which welding is common showed elevated odds ratios:2.9 for welders (95% CI 0.9-9.8); 4.9 (1.1-22.9) for structural metalworkers; 11.4 (2.6-49.9) for workers in structural metal production.Other job categories associated with lung cancer included: electriciansand workers in electrical machine production, woodworkers (in furnitureor cabinet making, but not in carpentry or joinery) and cleaning services.Smoking did not seem to exert a substantial confounding effect. Attributablerisk percentages for tobacco smoking were about 78% and 76% in the populationof the 2 areas.</TEXT></DOC>
