(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A Taiwanese gangster was sentencedWednesday to 27 years to life in prison for the 1984 murder of aChinese-American journalist, a slaying he said the Taiwanesegovernment had ordered.   Tung Kuei-sen, 36, a member of the Taiwan-based internationalgang United Bamboo, was convicted in March of gunning down HenryLiu in the garage of the writer's home in Daly City, a suburb ofSan Francisco.   With an ear cocked toward an interpreter, Tung, heard San MateoCounty Superior Court Judge Margaret J. Kemp call him guilty of``political terrorism.''   Tung drew 25 years to life for murder plus two years for use ofa firearm. Prosecutor Bob Bishop said Tung will be eligible forparole in 17 years, eight months.   The defendant was ordered to serve the sentence followingcompletion of a 20-year sentence for heroin smuggling. He isserving that sentence at a federal prison in Lewisburg, Pa.   The 52-year-old Liu was a columnist for Chinese-languagenewspapers in San Francisco and had just published an unflatteringbiography of Taiwanese President Chiang Ching-kuo, who died fourmonths ago.   Helen Liu testified at Tung's trial that before her husband'sslaying, the Taiwanese government had sent former friends of Liu'sto try to persuade him to quit criticizing the government.   Tung testified that Liu's killing was ordered by ChiangShiao-wu, grandson of former Chinese nationalist leader ChiangKai-shek and the son of former Chiang Ching-kuo.   Tung said he thought he was being a patriot in carrying out theslaying, and said at the close of the trial: ``This was an act ofthe (Taiwan) government. ... (I was) a scapegoat for the Taiwangovernment.''   He said he went to trial so that he could apologize and revealthe identities of those people behind the crime.   In a letter to the court, Mrs. Liu had asked that Tung be shownmercy, saying he ``entertained a very naive patriotism which wasshrewdly manipulated by the plotters who are still at large.''   Mrs. Liu said she had been ``touched by the repentance publiclyexpressed by Mr. Tung.''</TEXT></DOC>
