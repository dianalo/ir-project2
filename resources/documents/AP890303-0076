A Thai Interior Ministry official denied his country had forcedanyone back. The official, speaking Thursday on condition ofanonymity, said the report could damage relations between Thailandand Laos two weeks before scheduled talks on the repatriation ofLaotians.   The Lawyers Committee for Human Rights in its report cited twoNovember 1987 cases in which Laotian soldiers allegedly massacredgroups of 33 and 16 Laotian hill people just after they were evictedfrom Thai soil.   The 64-page report, however, gave no evidence of more recentlarge-scale killings. Western officials in Thailand involved inrefugee affairs said Thursday that Laotians seeking asylum are beingforced to return.   The officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said someslayings have been reported, but they have no evidence of hundredsof deaths.   In the 1987 massacre of 33 people, which has been cited by othersources, the report quoted the sole survivor, an 8-year-old girl.She told the committee that the soldiers lined up the group, putropes around the necks of the adults, told the women to hold theirbabies in front of them and opened fire.   ``Thailand has a policy of systematically denying asylum bypushing back Laotian asylum seekers on its northern border,'' thereport said. ``This has resulted in the deaths of hundreds, if notthousands, of Laotians.''   It said the policy ``represents a serious violation of humanrights and humanitarian principles.''   In January, the New York-based lawyers' committee angered Thaiofficials with a report saying that hundreds of Vietnamese boatpeople died last year after Thai authorities forced them back to sea.   Large numbers of Laotians have fled their homeland since theCommunists seized power in 1975. The persecution has been mostsevere on the hill people, or Hmongs, whom the United States hadrecruited to fight the Communists during the Indochina war.   Thai officials say they must take tough measures to curb theinflux of Laotians because they say the United States and otherWestern nations are not resettling enough of them.   It said that along the border, the Laotians ``are routinelysubject to extortion, rape and other forms of brutality bysmugglers, Thai and Vietnamese-Pathet Lao (Laotian Communist)security forces and other armed parties.''   Under a U.N. program, Thailand is supposed to allow entry to allLaotians into Thailand for an interview to determine whether theyfled political persecution or are economic migrants. But the reportsaid sections of the border are sealed off.   Along other border areas, ``extortion and bribery arewidespread,'' with some Laotians having to pay Thai officials toreceive an interview, the report said.   The report said that if fair procedures cannot be achieved, theU.N. refugee agency should ``publicly denounce'' the interviewprogram.   Western officials confirmed the abuses related to the screening.   According to U.N. figures through December, the Thais screened26,067 Laotians and admitted 22,492 of them as refugees.   The report also criticized abuses by Thai officials in theU.N.-aided camps housing about 76,000 Laotians. The camp commanderat Chiang Kham allegedly humiliated, tortured and raped refugees. Hewas transferred in May 1988 but has not been prosecuted, the reportsaid.</TEXT></DOC>
