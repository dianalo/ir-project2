The $109-a-share offer shattered a rival effort by an RJRmanagement group and came in a day of frantic maneuvering that attimes left the unprecedented auction for the company in utterconfusion.   Kohlberg's offer of $81 in cash, $18 in stock and additionalsecurities worth $10 beat out a last-minute offer valued at $112, or$25.2 billion, by the management group that instigated the takeoverstruggle last month at a price that was $8.3 billion cheaper.   The value of Kohlberg's offer was nearly double that of theprevious record, a $13.4 billion takeover of Gulf Corp. by ChevronCorp. in March 1984.   Although the management offer looked higher in face value, RJRsaid in a statement that its board of directors concluded theKohlberg offer was worth substantially the same.   ``The Board of Directors of RJR Nabisco, by unanimous vote of alldirectors present, adopted the KKR offer as being in the bestinterest of the company and its shareholders,'' RJR said.   Kohlberg, the undisputed leader in the business of buyingcompanies with borrowed money in deals known as leveraged buyouts,issued a statement that it was pleased with the decision that cappedthe biggest takeover in history.   ``We are also pleased that this process has come to an end sothat the employees of RJR, its consumers and suppliers and thecommunities it serves, can be assured that business will now returnto normal and stability will be restored,'' Kohlberg's twoprincipals, Henry R. Kravis and George Roberts, said in thestatement.   Kohlberg's victory caps a struggle that broke all previoustakeover records and raised major questions about the frenzy ofleveraged buyouts and other debt-financed restructuringstransforming much of corporate America.   The end of the RJR battle also signaled a spectacular defeat byits chief executive F. Ross Johnson, who began the takeover strugglelast month with a $75 a share offer that he later raised four times.   Johnson, known as a scrappy adversary unafraid of taking risks,had no immediate comment on Kohlberg's victory. It wasn'timmediately clear whether he would take another tack in what hasbeen an unpredictable battle.   Earlier in the day, Johnson's group made an 11th-hour effort toraise its bid from $101 a share to $108 a share after acompany-decreed deadline for all offers had expired. The movetemporarily upended a $106-a-share, $23.8 billion offer fromKohlberg Kravis that was about to be approved, sources said.   That development made the already unwieldy auction even morechaotic and raised questions about whether all bidders werereceiving equal treatment. It also sent RJR's stock roaring higher,partly in anticipation that the unprecedented auction might beprolonged yet again.   Sources familiar with the bidding also said the offer of a thirdcontender, First Boston Corp. was rejected as too tentative,although the bidder valued it as high as $115 a share or $25.87billion.   A crucial element of each proposal was the portion of cash eachbidder intended to pay, because the value of the securities segmentis difficult to determine. These securities often are worth lessthan their face amount.   RJR stock surged on the New York Stock Exchange and the Big Boardbriefly halted trading when buy orders overwhelmed sell orders onWednesday. The stock resumed trading by midafternoon and closed up$2.25 to $93 on volume exceeding 6.7 million shares.   RJR stock was trading at less than $56 a share when the battlebegan in late October.   Johnson's group incited the battle when he proposed to take thenation's 19th-largest industrial company private via a leveragedbuyout.   RJR's board of directors then put the company up for sale toattract rival bids and conducted the first round of an auction Nov.18-20. They decided to prolong it because the offers received weretoo vague and inadequate.   RJR is one of the largest consumer products companies, with morethan 120,000 employees. It makes well-known brands that range fromCamel cigarettes to Shredded Wheat cereal to Life Savers candy.</TEXT></DOC>
