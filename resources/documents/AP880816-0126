Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov repeated Kremlinaccusations that guerrillas fighting the Soviet-backed Afghangovernment have been supplied with weapons and other aid byPakistan in violation of the April 14 agreement signed in Geneva.   Gerasimov, speaking at a regular news briefing, also denied aU.S. allegation that the retreating Soviet forces have left behindas many as 30 million mines.   Half of the Soviet Union's more than 100,000 soldiers who hadbeen deployed in Afghanistan have returned since the withdrawalbegan May 15.   The Geneva agreement requires the other Soviet soldiers to beout of Afghanistan no later than Feb. 15, but Foreign MinisterEduard A. Shevardnadze has indicated the Kremlin would like all ofits troops home before the end of this year. Soviet forcesintervened in December 1979.   On Monday, the Tass news agency reported the second phase of thewithdrawal would begin in November, and Gerasimov confirmed thatthe pullout would likely extend beyond 1988.   ``The situation in Afghanistan does not give grounds toaccelerate the withdrawal of Soviet troops,'' he told reporters.   Gerasimov said rebel groups based in Pakistan have beenincreasing their attacks on Soviet-backed Afghan government troops,and that until the guerrillas laid down their arms and joined aproposed governing coalition, there would be no opportunity tocomplete the Soviet withdrawal early.   ``For the time being there is no possibility to reduce the planfor withdrawing Soviet troops,'' Gerasimov said.   The Soviet government has complained repeatedly that Pakistan isviolating the Geneva accords and on Monday threatened to takeunspecified action in response.   If military supplies to the insurgents continue, the statementsaid, ``the Soviet Union reserves for itself, in that case, theright to take such measures that are necessitated by thesituation.''   Gerasimov declined to specify what action the Soviet Union wouldtake, but said the statement was meant as a ``warning'' to Pakistan.   U.S. State Department spokesman Charles Redman told reporters inWashington on Monday that it appeared the Soviets were adhering totheir withdrawal commitments, but said the soldiers had left behindas many as 30 million mines, including booby-trapped toys.   ``We would like to state again that we are not involved in anymining,'' Gerasimov said, adding that Soviet soldiers have beenhelping Afghans remove and defuse mines planted by oppositionforces along major roads.   Tass reported Tuesday that the capital of Kabul was again underrocket fire, and said ``fierce fighting'' continued around Kunduz,a northern provincial capital.   Afghan President Najib and Soviet officials have said Kunduz waslost to guerrillas forces earlier this month but taken back againby government troops.   Two Moslem guerrilla groups claimed today in Pakistan that theirfighters were holding on to Kunduz despite heavy bombardment byAfghan government troops.   The guerrillas also claimed today that they captured Talogan,capital of Takhar province east of Kunduz, on Friday.   With about 50,000 Soviet troops remaining in Afghanistan,guerrillas have concentrated recent attacks around Kabul, northernprovinces and the southeastern provincial capital of Kandahar,abandoned by the Soviets the same time as Kunduz.   Many Western analysts predict Afghan government troops will notlast long against the Moslem insurgents, who are armed via Pakistanby the United States, China and Saudi Arabia.
