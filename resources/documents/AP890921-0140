(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A former aide at the PTL ministrytestified Thursday that she still thinks founder Jim Bakker wasunderpaid, even though she was laid off during the period he isaccused of taking hundreds of thousands of dollars in bonuses.   Elizabeth Sacco told a U.S. District Court jury said she's stillloyal to Bakker ``and I'm proud of it. I feel loyalty because I'veseen what this man built. A greedy man doesn't have his hair turngray in five years.   ``I wouldn't have taken his job for $10 million a year.''   Ms. Sacco, who answered correspondence for the ministry until herlayoff in 1986, was one of the first witnesses to testify for Bakkeras the defense phase of the 3{-week-old fraud trial got under way.The defense presented videotapes of old ``PTL Club'' shows onWednesday before calling the first witnesses Thursday.   Bakker, who resigned from the ministry in a sex-and-money scandalin 1987, is accused of fleecing his followers by diverting $3.7million raised from PTL partners to finance a lavish lifestyle.Prosecution witnesses testified that he and his wife, Tammy,received six-figure bonuses in the years before his resignation eventhough the ministry was in financial trouble. Mrs. Bakker is notcharged in the case.   If found guilty on all 24 counts, he could be sentenced to 120years in prison and fined more than $5 million.   Partners, who contributed at least $1,000, were promised a setnumber of days per year of free lodging at PTL's Heritage USA themepark in Fort Mill, S.C. But most of the lodging planned there wasnever built.   Still, Ms. Sacco said Bakker was ``very concerned about thepartners. He wanted them treated fairly and politely. He said thesewere the people who built this place.''   Government attorney Jerry Miller asked Ms. Sacco if she everheard Bakker telling people he oversold any of the partnerships.   ``I believe he did not know if, indeed, they were oversold,'' shesaid. ``Why would a man who worked so hard fleece his partners anddestroy the place he built?''   ``How about the Rolls-Royces and $500,000 homes?'' Miller asked.   ``Wasn't he entitled to have a home?'' she said.   ``How many homes was he entitled to?'' Miller asked, referring toprosecution allegations about luxury homes in California and Floridaas well as a lavish home at Tega Cay, S.C. She didn't respond.   In a heated exchange during the cross-examination, Miller askedher how an additional $3 million would have affected PTL.   After being asked the same question several times, Ms. Saccoreplied: ``I guess many people could have been helped, yes.''   Another witness, Louise Grimes of Hopkins, S.C., the owner of agas station, testified that she bought six lifetime partnerships atPTL and was always able to obtain reservations at the Christianretreat. She contradicted other partners who had testified for theprosecution that they had been unable to get reservations.   Under questioning by defense attorney George T. Davis, shedescribed the atmosphere at Heritage USA.   ``I want to say it's heavenly, but I don't know what heaven islike,'' she said. ``I can tell you that people were happy there.''   She testified that Bakker had helped her kick her cigarette habitand that she considered Heritage USA to be a holy place.   Also Thursday, Vicki Liddell, who worked at PTL's adoptionagency, said the ministry sheltered pregnant teen-agers andsucceeded in placing their babies in good homes.   ``Those families that could were asked to contribute, but by andlarge the bills were paid for by PTL,'' she said. She described themain purpose of the PTL home for unwed mothers as ``saving babiesfrom abortion.''</TEXT></DOC>
