ROSENTHAL</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Ron Brown, chairman of the Democratic NationalCommittee, told an audience of blacks and Jews Monday that theymust ensure their relationship does not deteriorate despite honestdifferences.   ``Differences that can anger and even enrage cannot be allowedto divide us,'' Brown told an observance at the Israeli Embassy ofMartin Luther King's birthday. ``We must realize that thedifferences between our communities are not recognized by DavidDuke and the Ku Klux Klan; that race hatred and religiouspersecution walk hand-in-hand,'' he said.   Duke is a former Klan leader serving in the LousianaLegislature. He has ties to neo-Nazi groups and is president of theNational Association for the Advancement of White People.   Brown, the first black to be elected to the Democratic Party'schairmanship, was the featured speaker at the fifth commemorativeobservance held at the embassy.   He said that just as King took his message outside his churchand into the streets, ``We must leave behind this gathering ofelites, and carry a message to those in our communities who are nothere _ the poor and disaffected, the uneducated, the prejudiced andthe angry people who search for targets and scapegoats.   ``That message is this: it is not Jews that have bombed andthreatened civil rights leaders, and it is not blacks who arepainting swastikas on synagogues,'' Brown said. ``We do notthreaten one another.''   He recalled for the audience that Jews and blacks ``stoodtogether for justice, sat at lunch counters, rode in buses acrossthe south, marked on Washington, picketed, organized and votedtogether.   ``Two-thirds of the whites who went to Mississippi for freedomsummer, two-thirds of those students who put their lives on theline, two-thirds were Jewish,'' said Brown.   Moshe Arad, the Israel ambassador to the United States, saidthere was a unique bond between King's ``deep faith and ardentcommitment'' and the dteachings and values of Judaism.   ``Perhaps that is why so many Jews flocked to his banner, andenlisted in his cause, and supported his movement,'' Arad said.   ``We in Israel, no less than the Jews of America, have longcherished Dr. King,'' the ambassador said.</TEXT></DOC>
