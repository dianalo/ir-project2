That was thehighest level since 1982. And the report, issued by theAmerican Petroleum Institute late Tuesday, after most oilmarkets had closed, triggered a near free-fall in oil pricesthat swept around the world.</LP><TEXT>   But the API report of swollen U.S. crude inventories, theapparent catalyst for this latest price fall, only reflectsthe world oil glut resulting from continued high productionby the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, oilanalysts noted.   &quot;It's only symptomatic; the reality is that the market isoversupplied (by OPEC),&quot; said Michael Rothman, vice presidentand senior energy analyst at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets inNew York.   Although OPEC agreed in early May to cut back onproduction by more than one million barrels a day, Mr.Rothman said preliminary estimates suggest that total outputhasn't yet been trimmed. &quot;Saudi Arabia seems to haveimplemented a reduction,&quot; he said, &quot;but that is being offsetby increases from others.&quot;   Prices began falling Tuesday night in the U.S. cash marketand then continued declining as trading opened yesterday inAsia, the Middle East and then in Europe. Spot prices ofMiddle East and North Sea crudes were down between 45 centsand 85 cents a barrel. On London's International PetroleumExchange, Brent blend crude oil futures closed 38 to 48 centslower.   The price fall came full circle by the time yesterday'sfutures trading opened in the U.S. The July crude contractopened 32 cents a barrel lower on the New York MercantileExchange, and some traders worried that the plunge wouldcarry the Merc crude, near $20 a barrel less than two weeksago, down to as low as $17.   The July contract did briefly fall through the technicallyimportant level of $18 a barrel, but recovered a bit beforetrading ended. It settled at $18.14, down 78 cents. TheAugust contract ended at $18.77 a barrel, down 65 cents.   There were reports in the oil industry that Saudiofficials, who stubbornly resist any indication that thekingdom may be returning to its old role of OPEC's so-calledswing producer, will soon grow impatient with Kuwait, theUnited Arab Emirates and others who had pledged to curtailoutput also. The guessing yesterday was that the Saudis, nowapparently back down to their quota of 5.4 million barrels aday, would expand production again to recapture theirtraditional share of nearly 24.5% of OPEC output within twoor three weeks unless it's clear others have begun to reduceoutput.   Also affecting the oil market was speculation among sometraders that the Saudis may be selling large amounts of oilfrom their above-ground inventories even though they have cutback on wellhead production. Some linked this to reports theSaudis also were selling gold. The theory, still unconfirmed,is that &quot;they are selling oil and gold to get the dollars tobuy British pounds&quot; to help pay for their multibillion-dollararms deal with Britain, according to Peter Beutel of EldersFutures Inc., New York.   Further adding to the worries over the oil glut, meantime,was word that the Trans-Panama pipeline, which carriesAlaskan crude across the Isthmus, had to be closedtemporarily because storage tanks were filled at either end.   Many in the oil industry expect OPEC to react to the pricefall with further statements that its production is comingdown. But some questioned whether such statements will anylonger be enough to stop the fall in oil prices. &quot;The peoplein the industry who are dealing with physical barrels aregoing to wait for actual figures,&quot; said Neil Chandi,president, Crescent International Petroleum Ltd.   Still, there were hints yesterday that the heavy flow ofoil from OPEC may be starting to taper off, if ever soslightly. The volume of oil currently on the water in tankersstill is &quot;extremely high&quot; for this time of the year, said RoyMason, who tracks such shipments in a Britain-basedpublication called Oil Afloat. &quot;But, on the other hand, themovement from {OPEC} loading ports is clearly on the waydown,&quot; he said, noting that neither Iran nor Saudi Arabia hasentered the spot tanker market in three weeks.   In other commodity markets yesterday:                                                                                                          GRAINS AND SOYBEANS: Futures prices closed mixed as earlyrallies in many contract months died out or reversedthemselves on reports that the Soviet Union may not begranted most-favored-nation trading status at theU.S.-U.S.S.R. summit meeting beginning next Wednesday.Heavier-than-expected rains across portions of Iowa andsouthern Minnesota, reviving fears that some farmers may notget their crops planted early enough this year, helpedsupport futures prices early in the session. In the finalhour of trading yesterday, Secretary of State James Baker wasquoted by wire services as saying he doubted the Soviet Unionwould be granted most-favored-nation status during the summitbecause it apparently won't be able to pass a law encouragingJewish emigration by that time. Unfettered emigration ofSoviet Jews is a prerequisite of granting most-favored-nationstatus.                                                                                                          COPPER: Futures prices eased. The July delivery ended witha loss of 1.10 cents a pound at $1.1505. Improving laborconditions and rising supplies contributed to the decline, ananalyst said. He noted that inventories of copper inwarehouses of the Commodity Exchange rose 1,177 tons to10,169 tons. It was the third consecutive day of increasesand a three-month high for the supplies. The settlement of anew labor contract by Kennecott Corp. and the UnitedSteelworkers removed some concern over possible supplydisruptions that could have resulted if no agreement had beenreached when the current contract expires on June 30.However, the analyst noted, there still remain two otherAmerican producers that have to negotiate new laborcontracts, and uncertainty would increase again if the talksare prolonged.                                                                                                          COTTON: The July contract ended with a narrow gain afterprofit-taking trimmed early advances. July finished 0.08 centa pound higher at 79.85 cents, but earlier had traded at81.30 cents, a new life-of-contract high for the secondconsecutive day. However, one analyst noted, buying lackedfollow-through &quot;because cotton at over 81 cents seemsexpensive&quot; and traders decided to take profits.</TEXT></DOC>
