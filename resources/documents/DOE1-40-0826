Algorithmrealizations on the base of MMKFK program complex are described. Themethod of splitting and roulette (SR) is used as one of the methods forreducing dispersion in calculations of radiation shields of nuclear powerplants by the Monte Carlo method. The idea of the SR method is rathersimple: if the increase of particle contribution to unkmonen functionalJ is expected during particle motion in a phase space, it is splittedinto several particles with lesser weights; in the opposite case theparticle is annihilated with some probability in roulette, and survivedparticle continnes its motion with greater weight. Different versionsof the SR realization are distinguished by the methods of determiningsignificance of particle with respect to J during motion in phase space,the mechanism and parameters of splitting and those of roulette. 12 refs.;1 tab.</TEXT></DOC>
