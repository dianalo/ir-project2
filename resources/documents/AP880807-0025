At a Boston news conference the day before the Republicans sitdown in New Orleans to draft their platform, Democratic NationalCommittee Chairman Paul Kirk and U.S. Rep. William Gray,D-Pennsylvania, said the Republican Party platform may look fine onpaper to moderate voters. In practice, they said, the Republicanshave failed to live up to a host of promises they made in 1984.   Gray, who chaired the Democratic platform committee in Atlantalast month, said the Republican platform will likely make manypromises palatable to Democrats. ``They'll say `we're for humanrights in South Africa, but we're not going to oppose apartheid,'''Gray said.   In attacking the Republican platform, the Democrats mimicked atactic used by the Republicans earlier this summer before theDemocratic National Convention. The Republican barrage came in a``fact-fiction'' format in which Democratic promises were comparedwith delivery.   On Sunday, Kirk's aides handed out a release based on a similar``promise vs. fact'' format.   The release said, for example, that the Reagan administrationpromised in 1984 to get tough on terrorists only to later tradearms for hostages with Iran; that after promising to hold publicofficials to the highest standards, 242 administration officialsresigned under indictment, scandal or the threat of prosecution;and that despite a commitment to health care, 37 million Americanslack health insurance;and the 1984 GOP platform failed to evenmention AIDS.   Kirk and his Republican counterpart, Frank Farhenkopf,co-chaired a commission that earlier this year proposed holdingthree debates between the presidential nominees and one between thevice presidential candidates.   ``When it became clear that George Bush was to be the nominee,the signals changed,'' Kirk said. ``George Bush was not going tomake a commitment.''   Top aides to Bush were quoted recently as saying the vicepresident would prefer only one debate with Dukakis, theMassachusetts governor.   But Bush said Sunday in Kennebunkport, Maine, that he would holdmore than one debate but would not specify how many, when or where.   ``There will be debates, and I look forward to them,'' Bushsaid. ``But I'm not the nominee of our party yet and we have plentyof time to determine how many, where and all of that.''   ``There'll be more than one debate, but how many...has not beensorted out yet,'' he said.   Bush campaign spokeswoman Alixe Glen also said Sunday that Bushplanned to wait until he officially receives the Republicannomination before deciding on a debating format.   Kirk and Gray acknowledged that the Democrats are trying tounseat the Republicans from the White House at a time whenunemployment is down and the economy is strong.   ``Yes, there are some good signs out there. Unemployment isdown. Economic growth is still strong,'' Gray said. But he saidthat Bush, ``sees that the sun is shining today and he jumps to theconclusion that the sun will shine tomorrow and the next day andforever.''   Gray used a Bush term in describing the vice president's deficitreduction plan as ``voodoo'' budgeting. And Bush's flexible freezeproposal to trim federal spending, Gray said, ``is flexible frozenfruitcake.''   Fahrenkopf did not immediately return phone calls from hisoffice in New Orleans where he is preparing for the GOP convention.</TEXT></DOC>
