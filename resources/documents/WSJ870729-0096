But many of the gains were spurred by local factors.    In Tokyo, export-dependent machine tool and pharmaceutical shares moved up. Heavy buying by securities houses and positive economic reports also spurred the market.    The Nikkei stock average surged 280.84 points to 24385.82. Turnover increased sharply to 750 million shares from 350 million Monday. Gainers outnumbered losers 627 to 265.    Traders cited a Monday report that Japan's industrial and mining production in June rose 2.1% from a year earlier and 3.4% from May. The strong month-to-month improvement suggests the country's major industries are recovering from the erosive effects of the strong yen.    Speculation also centered on an expected surge in spending for public works projects that will lead to rising demand for stainless steel products.    Shares that benefit from strong exports surged because of the dollar's rise against the yen.    Traders said turnover was dominated by large securities houses, which apparently poured liquidity into the market in a bid to further stimulate the market in line with a meeting last week with government officials. The Finance Ministry reportedly is concerned about an overly bearish reception for the second issue of Nippon Telegraph andamp; Telephone shares, due in October.    Among export-led electrical and computer shares, Kyocera soared 180 yen to 6,300 yen ($41.92), Alps Electric was up 120 yen to 2,700 yen, Matsushita Electric Industrial rose 90 yen to 2,400 yen and Japan Victor sprinted ahead 70 yen to 3,300.    In the steel group, Kawasaki Steel rose seven yen to 260 yen, and Nippon Stainless Steel rose 30 yen to 493 yen.    Superconductor-oriented issues were pushed higher on news of advances in the field.    London share prices ended broadly higher, boosted by a positive outlook for the British economy issued by the Confederation of British Industry.    The report, issued quarterly, said there isn't any evidence to suggest Britain's relatively fast economic growth rate risks accelerating inflation or significantly worsening the trade balance.    The report reassured market participants about the economy's prospects after recent news of a wider-than-expected British trade deficit in May and sharply increased bank lending in June, dealers said.    The 100-share index ended up 26 points at 2359.9, and the Financial Times 30-share index surged 20.8 points to 1855. Volume rose to 793.8 million shares from 559.6 million shares Monday.    Also giving the market a boost was good demand for shares in BAA, the newly privatized airport authority, on the first day of official dealings, and results from National Westminster Bank, dealers said.    National Westminster reported that pretax profit for the first half plunged 48%, a smaller decline than expected. The bank's shares rose 11 pence to 762 pence ($12.18) after trading as high as 773 pence. Other bank issues were mostly higher.    Partly paid shares of BAA were quoted at 146 pence late in the day, yielding less initial profit for investors than other recently denationalized companies.    Glaxo Holdings was up 41 pence at #17.90. The company said it agreed to buy the Geneva-based biotechnology research facility of Biogen, including marketing rights for two drugs being tested for possible use in fighting cancer and acquired immune deficiency syndrome. The drugs, however, are years away from possible marketing. Other pharmaceutical shares were mostly higher.    In Frankfurt, West German share prices gained as a rise in the dollar encouraged foreign investors, and many market participants shrugged off lower earnings from Commerzbank.    The country's third-largest commercial bank said partial operating profit fell 29% in the first half, to 308.7 million marks ($166 million) from 436.9 million marks a year earlier. It cited lower stock market volume, which cut commission income.    Earnings reports at Dresdner Bank and Deutsche Bank are expected later this week and are likely to show similar declines, analysts said.    &quot;A fairly sizable reduction in bank earnings has already been discounted,&quot; an analyst said. As a result, the negative numbers aren't likely to affect equities trading, the analyst said.    Despite the report, Commerzbank gained 6.2 marks to 289.5 marks ($156.02), Deutsche Bank was up 12 marks to 647 marks and Dresdner Bank was up 7.5 marks to 337.5 marks.    Elsewhere in Europe, stock prices also advanced. Paris shares were boosted by good French unemployment figures for June and expectations of lower interest rates.    Zurich shares broke out of a weeklong consolidation and advanced strongly. The market was perked up by the firm dollar, which enticed foreign and domestic institutional investors back to the market, dealers said.    Brussels shares surged to another record in an unseasonally heavy market. Prices gained across the board as the momentum of the monthlong bull market continued.    In Stockholm, share prices also advanced across a broad front, in the most active trading of the summer, as lower interest rates and optimistic inflation news drove the market to a record.    Here are price trends on the world's major stock markets, as calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital International Perspective, Geneva. To make them directly comparable, each index is based on the close of 1969 equaling 100.
