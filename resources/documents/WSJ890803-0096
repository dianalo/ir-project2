Their enthusiasm notwithstanding, someone needs to put the allegations in perspective. Crimes may have been committed, but when we heard &quot;RICO&quot; we trebled the usual presumption of innocence.    The sting at the lively Chicago Board of Trade and Mercantile Exchange -- apparently triggered by competitors of the targeted traders -- has been curious from the start. News broke last winter when federal agents rapped on front doors at midnight to demand that traders either cop a plea and testify against others or lose their cars and jewelry on the spot under the pre-trial asset-seizure provisions of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations law. Sentence first, trial later.    Whatever the alleged crimes, these tactics violated the Justice Department's own guidelines prohibiting RICO threats &quot;solely or even primarily to create a bargaining tool.&quot; Coerced pleas under these circumstances raise credibility problems.    Another problem with RICO is that it's hard to discover the alleged wrongdoing when the Attorney General joins a claim that dozens of trading operations are &quot;racketeering enterprises.&quot; Indeed, whatever the accused may have done, prosecutors risk undermining the integrity of markets and the legal system by invoking RICO's broad &quot;fraud&quot; allegations instead of sticking to specific claims under commodities laws.    Some traders are accused of nothing more criminal than trading after the closing bell. Others may have bought or sold without telling their customers that they were on the other side of the deal, clearly a serious deception. One problem with RICO is that traders charged with rather trivial offenses are lumped under one indictment, can have all their assets frozen and stand trial with others accused of serious offenses.    Charges of rigged trades are certainly worth investigating, but we note that unlike the broader New York and American stock exchanges, futures trading involves sophisticated parties. These customers are unlikely to have made Chicago the futures capital of the world if they had thought trade rigging a common practice. Before RICO, prosecutors would have exercised some discretion about whether the general efficiency of the market was so endangered that criminal prosecution was needed.    Exhibit A of how RICO tempts prosecutors to substitute an undefined charge of racketeering for serious thought about how markets actually work is the Princeton/Newport case, where several securities officials were convicted this week. The prosecutors said the firm had engaged in fraudulent trades aimed at evading taxes, but relied on RICO's notoriously broad &quot;predicate acts&quot; of mail fraud and wire fraud, not sections of the tax code. Indeed, the IRS admits the firm in fact overpaid its taxes. Still, it's not totally surprising that the jury convicted. Juries in this country are usually entitled to trust that prosecutors have brought allegations of an actual crime. With RICO, a vague accusation of &quot;sleaze&quot; is enough.    This is one reason four Supreme Court Justices said this term that RICO may well be unconstitutionally vague. The entire concept of the rule of law requires clear criminal statutes, defining with precision what behavior is permitted and what is not. Chicago traders may be guilty of something, but the one certainty is that RICO is a lousy way to discover what. </TEXT></DOC>
