STEICHEN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   West German Rudolf Cordes, home after20 months of captivity in the hands of pro-Iranian kidnappers inBeirut, was flown to an undisclosed location to rest and enjoy areunion with his wife and two sons.   Reporters were given no chance to talk to the 55-year-oldFrankfurt businessman upon his arrival at Cologne-Bonn airportTuesday night.   West German officials, including Foreign Minister Hans-DietrichGenscher, have denied making any payments for Cordes' freedom. Hewas released by his pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem kidnappers lateMonday night.   But the mass-circulation Bild newspaper of Hamburg said ``a sumof millions is believed to have been paid to kidnappers for therelease.'' Bild cited unidentified security sources.   The newspaper also quoted a source identified only as a``security expert'' as saying that at least 40 million marks ($22.2million) were paid for Cordes' release. Bild is known to have goodsources within the government.   A high-ranking government official described Cordes' longcaptivity, the isolation he endured, and his constant uncertaintyover his fate.   The Los Angeles Times said today Iran apparently arranged forCordes to be transferred from captors linked to Mohammed AliHamadi, who is being tried in Germany for hijacking a TWA jet, tothe group that freed the West German.   Iran apparently arranged the release to regain favor with WestGermany, a vital trading partner and the Western nation with whichit has the closest ties, the Times said, citing unidentifiedsources.   Cordes was abducted in West Beirut in January 1987, three daysbefore a West German engineer, Alfred Schmidt, was kidnapped.Schmidt was freed Sept. 7, 1987. The Hamadi clan was believed tohave abducted both men.   Cordes and his wife, Marlene, touched down at 10:20 p.m. aboarda twin-engine West German military jet after a five-hour flightfrom Syria.   The federal minister for chancellery affairs, WolfgangSchaeuble, was aboard the same plane.   Schaeuble later told West German television that Cordes was``feeling better than he had expected.''   ``But naturally he's very weak. He's probably feeling better nowbecause of the initial excitement than he will be tomorrow or theday after tomorrow,'' the official said.   ``He's been flown to a place where he can find privacy for atime. He desperately needs quiet, to recover, to work through theexperience.   ``I don't know where he's going and even if I knew I wouldn'tsay,'' the official said.   Schaeuble said Cordes told him his kidnappers ``treated himhumanely, but the conditions were hard, he was always isolated andwas always chained.''   Hans Neusel, a state secretary in the federal Interior Ministry,told reporters at the airport Cordes said there were signs he wasabout to be released before it happened.   ``His hopes increased when he was given new clothes three daysbefore he was freed,'' said Neusel, who also was on the plane withCordes.   Schaeuble said Cordes could not identify the kidnappers becausethey wore masks in his presence.   The minister, who headed the government's Middle East crisisstaff, reiterated earlier government statements that no deals weremade for Cordes' release.   Cordes, Beirut manager for the Hoechst AG pharmaceuticalcompany, was freed in Beirut at midnight Monday by Shiite Moslemextremists. Syrian officers escorted him to Damascus after hisrelease.   Cordes was the last West German hostage in Lebanon, where 17other foreigners are still missing and believed held captive. Thelongest held is Terry Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent ofThe Associated Press, who was kidnapped on March 16, 1985.   Cordes' captors, a group calling itself the Holy Warriors forFreedom, said in a statement Monday that they were freeing him inresponse to Iranian and Syrian intervention.   The kidnappers also said his release was linked to Hamadi, aLebanese Shiite on trial in West Germany for a 1985 TWA jetlinerhijacking and the shooting death of U.S. Navy diver Robert Stethem.   Hamadi's older brother, Abbas, is serving a 13-year prisonsentence in Frankfurt. He was convicted in April of complicity inkidnapping Cordes and Schmidt in an effort to force West Germany tofree Mohammed Hamadi.</TEXT></DOC>
