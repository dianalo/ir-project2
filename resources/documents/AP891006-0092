Party Chairman Rezsoe Nyers also appealed to the 1,279 congressdelegates to rid the party of members opposed to sweeping change _orthodox Marxists and centrists who want to tinker with the systemwithout scrapping it for a new one.   ``The historic role of the Hungarian Socialist Workers Party hasreached an end here,'' said Nyers, using the formal name of theCommunist Party in a keynote speech on the opening day of thecongress.   ``It is my belief that the new party cannot be Communist,'' saidNyers. He said the fledgling party should be a synthesis of theCommunist Party and European-style social democratic parties, witha new name no longer mentioning ``Workers'' to reflect its broaderbase.   Nyers, a moderate reformer, occupies the middle of the politicalspectrum among the four-man leadership. He echoed his more liberalco-leaders Imre Pozsgay and Premier Miklos Nemeth in calling forthe removal of conservatives who cannot accept fundamental change.   But Karoly Grosz, the most conservative member of the partyleadership, launched a veiled attack on Pozsgay and Nemeth, both ofwhom have said they would rather see a party split than cooperatewith orthodox Marxists.   Grosz said that alleged intolerance of unidentified partyleaders toward differing opinions was reminiscent of ``oldStalinist practices, even if they're covered with the sweet glazeof reformism.''   The four-man leadership was formed in June in an attempt tobridge growing ideological differences within the party.   But the differing political persuasions of the leadersthemselves led to growing estrangement at the top, and Groszacknowledged major differences between him and his colleagues.   He also directly contradicted Nyers, formally the senior leader,saying the party should not give up Communist ideals and shouldkeep the word Workers in its name.   Earlier, reformist Central Committee member Maria Ormos evokedthe memory of Imre Nagy, the executed political leader of the 1956anti-Stalinist revolution who for more than three decades had beenbranded a triator.   In its new reformist drive, the party rehabilitated Nagy earlythis year, hailing him as a forerunner of current change. Ms. Ormoscompared him to revered 19th century revolutionary leaders whofought for greater democracy.   Nothing less than the political direction of Hungary is underdiscussion at the congress, which opened today and is scheduled toend Sunday.   The reformist leadership wants to move toward a multipartysystem and a market economy. Conservatives want a return to Marxistorthodoxy.   The opposing stances have meant a growing polarization withinthe party.   Conservatives say they will seek to oust reformist leaders,reformists have called on supporters to cleanse the party ofconservatives, and just about the only issue both sides agree on isthe possibility of a party split.   Communist leaders and the political opposition have agreed therewill be free elections by June but sentiment within the partyagainst far-reaching reform could doom such plans.   At times in recent months Hungary has moved ahead of Poland _the only Soviet bloc country not dominated by Communists _ in itspace of reform. But unlike Hungary, Poland has been cautious not tooffend its hard-line Warsaw Pact partners.   Hungary alienated three East Bloc allies _ East Germany, Romaniaand Czechoslovakia _ with its liberal policies, including itsdecision to allow East Germans free passage to the West.   The orthodox Marxists are joining critics from abroad. They areangry about a Central Committee draft manifesto that proposed aradical change in the makeup of their Communist Party.   The 20-page document, prepared for the congress, foresees a``constitutional state based on a multiparty system, in which thesource of power is the will of the people, manifested at freeelections,'' and ``an efficient market economy.''   Voting on the draft is a principal task of the 1,200 delegates,but they also face other tough choices, such as electing partyleaders. A defeat of Pozsgay or Nyers would be a major setback forthe reformists.</TEXT></DOC>
