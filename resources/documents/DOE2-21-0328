The latest poll was designed to:measure public opinion in the County of Hawaii relevant to geothermaldevelopment for electrical power supplied to Island of Hawaii residentsonly; measure public opinion in the County of Hawaii relevant to geothermaldevelopment of electricity to be exported for use on Oahu; and identifybarriers to, and opportunities for energy conservation programs, includinggeothermal development. In general, the residents of the County of Hawaiifavor some form of geothermal development. Issues on geothermal developmentof concern to the public were similar to those mentioned in the 1982study. Basically, the issues amount to a trade-off between the economicadvantages and the environmental problems of geothermal development.The strong points in favor of development include a perceived need formore energy, a strong preference for alternate energy forms over petroleum,perceived benefits for the local economy and the employment rates, andthe possibility that development may reduce or contain utility bills.On the other hand, it appears that geothermal development will causehealth problems for those who live near the wells, be hazardous to floraand fauna in the Puna area, and create noise and odor above tolerablelevels. These are oversimplified statements of the reasons behind bothsupport and opposition for geothermal development.</TEXT></DOC>
