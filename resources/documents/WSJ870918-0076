This week's output would be 9% lower than the year-ago volume of 151,425.    General Motors Corp. is expected to build 69,239 cars this week compared with 51,825 last week; Ford Motor Co., 35,625 compared with 27,711; and Chrysler Corp., 20,862 compared with 18,936.    Chrysler said it scheduled two plants to operate on overtime next week, and one to operate on overtime tomorrow. Chrysler's Belvidere, Ill., assembly plant isn't scheduled to operate next week, because of the contract-related strike by auto workers at its Canadian operations, which supply parts to the Belvidere plant.    ---            This    Last  Yr.
