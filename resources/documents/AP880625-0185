Haiti has been volatile and probably willcontinue to be volatile.''   Also commenting was the Rev. Hugo Trieste, director of the RomanCatholic station Radio Soleil, which mobilized opposition todictator Jean-Claude Duvalier in the months preceding Duvalier'sflight to exile in February 1986.   ``I have to think we still are on the path to democracy, butthat path has taken a strange twist,'' Trieste said.   Last Sunday evening, Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy broke out of housearrest, forced his way into the National Palace and expelledPresident Leslie Manigat. He proclaimed himself president,dissolved the Senate and Chamber of Deputies, appointed a militaryCabinet and announced he would rule by decree.   Haitians went about their business as if nothing happened.   These same Haitians took to the streets by the thousands todemonstrate against Namphy when he led the junta that ruled afterDuvalier left, and registered by the hundreds of thousands to votein last November's aborted elections.   An opposition leader, trying to explain the indifference, saidmost residents of this impoverished, overcrowded Caribbean nationof 6 million did not feel the change of government directlyaffected their daily struggles for food and shelter.   Also, many Haitians felt Manigat's presidency was tainted by hisacceptance of elections last January that were flawed by low voterturnout, a boycott by more popular candidates and allegedmanipulation of the tally by the Namphy junta.   The political opponent spoke on condition of anonymity.   The Roman Catholic Church, Haiti's most influential institution,issued no statement on the coup. Most political and labor leaderswho did issue statements chose not to put themselves in openconfrontation with the army.   But the stage is set for renewed conflict.   The 7,000-man army may not be so united as it seemed whenleaders from all major units stood behind Namphy during a shortspeech he delivered last Monday on state-run television.   Namphy, the 55-year-old former commander-in-chief, is in poorhealth and may be a figurehead, said one high-ranking governmentofficial, who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear ofretribution.   ``They (officers) are gorillas,'' the official said. ``Theycan't run a government. They proved that and will prove it again.''   Haitians are not expected to stand by idly while the armyrestricts freedom of the press, rules by decree rather than by law,and tolerates corruption and human rights abuses as it did duringthe two years Namphy led the junta.   Already last week, aides and followers of Manigat were arrestedand held without charge, and the 1987 constitution was repeatedlyviolated.   Manigat provoked his own downfall by siding with Col.Jean-Claude Paul, commander of the army's second-biggest unit, in adispute with Namphy. He then retired Namphy and put him under housearrest.   Manigat felt the army was his biggest obstacle to reform. Heattempted to seize the opportunity of an apparent rift in the ranksto exert civilian control and consolidate his own political power.   He almost carried it off. The army appeared to accept Namphy'souster, and also Manigat's reorganization of the army in whichabout three dozen officers _ many of them Namphy allies _ wereordered transferred to lesser posts and assignments.   Ironically, Manigat may have been thwarted by a handful ofprivates and sergeants of the presidential guard. These men, actingout of apparent loyalty to Namphy, appeared at the militaryleader's walled-in compound on the outskirts of the capital with anarmored personnel carrier and carried him back to the NationalPalace.</TEXT><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE><TEXT>   Ed McCullough is Caribbean news editor of TheAssociated Press, based in San Juan, Puerto Rico.</TEXT></DOC>
