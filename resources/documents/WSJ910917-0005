The group, formed in March 1990, invited the Sovietstate-run aircraft maker to join partly because of itsexperience in designing and producing supersonic planes. &quot;Welook at them as bringing a lot to the table,&quot; a Boeing Co.spokesman said at Seattle headquarters.</LP><TEXT>   The alliance, which said it extended its studies foranother year, has been exploring environmental, marketing andother international issues surrounding the production of sucha plane, which would travel at 2.5 times the speed of soundand could become the most lucrative jet-building projectever. The other group members are: Aerospatiale of France,British Aerospace PLC, Boeing Co.'s Boeing CommercialAirplane Group, McDonnell Douglas Corp., and Germany'sDeutsche Airbus.   Various aerospace concerns have recently been separatelyteaming up to explore production of such a plane, which isn'texpected to become available until the year 2005.   Such a plane might fly at about 1,400 miles an hour, havea range of as much as 5,000 miles, and carry 300 passengers.The Concorde, the only supersonic passenger jet, flies atabout 1,400 miles an hour, has a range of as much as 3,500miles and carries 100 people.</TEXT></DOC>
