With the cease-fire, Nicaragua's Sandinista government and the U.S.-backed Contras have taken a difficult first step toward national reconciliation. But there is broad agreement both here and in Central America that the biggest challenges are ahead: The bitter adversaries still must wrestle with divisive internal issues, and the rebels must keep their forces intact in case the Sandinistas renege on promises to move toward a more democratic society.    &quot;A cease-fire is only the beginning,&quot; said Francisco Villagran, Guatemala's ambassador to the Organization of American States. &quot;There's no doubt that what's coming is the most difficult and complex stage of negotiations.&quot;    In talks beginning April 6 with the government in Managua, the Contras are expected to press demands such as that the country's military and police be separated from the Sandinista party, and that there be municipal elections.    White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater called the agreement reached Wednesday night, for a 60-day nationwide cease-fire to begin April 1, &quot;an important step&quot; that &quot;opens the gate&quot; to a peace process. But he warned that &quot;we are somewhat skeptical, given the history of Sandinista compliance&quot; with previous peace proposals.    Privately, an administration hardliner complained that the Contras might have won some political concessions up front if Congress hadn't undercut them by refusing to approve an administration aid package for the rebels. &quot;Congress blackjacked the Contras into accepting the cease-fire,&quot; he asserted.    Congressional Democrats, however, claimed that the cease-fire vindicated their decision to reject the administration's package, which included weapons and ammunition. &quot;We gave peace a chance and the peace process worked,&quot; said House Majority Whip Tony Coelho (D., Cal.).    Still, the cease-fire was a political reprieve for some Democrats. When Nicaraguan troops crossed into Honduras last week, it seemed to many that Contra-aid opponents had encouraged Sandinista aggression. Embarrassed Democrats hurriedly started considering an aid package. Now, the Sandinistas' decision to follow the incursion by a cease-fire accord greatly relieves those lawmakers. &quot;The smallest diplomatic move on their {the Sandinistas'} part erases many sins&quot; in the eyes of the congressional Democrats, said the administration hardliner.    Legislators expect to approve Contra aid limited to food, clothing, shelter and medical supplies before going home next Thursday for a weeklong Easter break. The agreement signed by the Contras prohibits them from receiving military aid.    One unresolved issue in Congress is whether lawmakers should guarantee to President Reagan that they'll allow a vote on military aid if the peace talks falter. Republican lawmakers argue that maintaining the threat of such a vote is necessary to keep pressure on the Sandinistas. &quot;It will strengthen the peace process,&quot; said Sen. Richard Lugar (R., Ind.), a member of the Foreign Relations Committee.    Democratic leaders say they would support the Contras if the talks fail and hostilities resume. But in the meantime, they argue, promising a possible vote on military aid wouldn't be productive. &quot;It's like in a marriage ceremony saying that if this thing doesn't work we'll have expedited procedures for a divorce,&quot; said House Speaker James Wright (D., Texas).    The Contras, for their part, could benefit from less reliance on the U.S. &quot;It's about time they stopped being a proxy army,&quot; said a Latin American diplomat. &quot;If they want to be a constant voice in Nicaraguan political life, they need to stop always depending on the will of the U.S. Congress.&quot;    Included in the cease-fire accord reached in Sapoa, Nicaragua, a customs station near the Costa Rican border, are pledges by the Sandinistas gradually to grant amnesty to various political opponents and to permit all political exiles to return to the country without being persecuted. Managua said it will release 100 Contra prisoners Sunday.    The Contras also are guaranteed representation in talks between the Sandinista government and Nicaragua's internal opposition groups, and they're assured the right to participate in the country's electoral process.    The agreement represents significant concessions by both sides. As recently as a year ago, the Sandinistas were refusing to meet with the Contras; this week's sessions in effect legitimize the rebel movement. The pact also signals that the Contras recognize that they can't oust the Sandinistas militarily, and that both sides will have to find a way to live with each other.    ---   Michael Allen in Miami and Gerald F.
