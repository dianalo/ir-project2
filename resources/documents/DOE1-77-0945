<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-77-0945 </DOCNO><TEXT>With the discovery of high temperature superconductive ceramic materials,a new era of superconduction has started. If ceramic superconductivematerials are put to practical use, much easier application of superconductionwill be materialized, and it is expected that the fields of applicationof superconduction will be greatly expanded. In 1987, announcments weremade about the successful resistance reduction in very high temperaturesof above 77K, 93K and 200K, followed by the zero resistance announcement.However, all of the samples still have many problems. The structure ofhigh temperature oxide superconductor was briefly explained. For practicalapplication of high temperature super conductors, upper critical magneticfield and critical current density will be important parameters in additionto the critical temperatue. The result of the measurement of the uppercritical magnetic field Hc{sub 2} of Ba{sub 2}YCuO/sub/(7-x) monocrystalwas presented. Jc obtained from the magnetization curve of sintered compactof oxidized YU-Ba-Cu-O was compared with the Jc value measured by theresistance method. A wiring technology was introduced which may be usedfor putting superconductors for practical use. (6 figs, 9 refs)</TEXT></DOC>
