Only once since the Clean Air Act was enacted in 1970 hasCongress been able to agree on major amendments to strengthen thebasic law, and that occurred 11 years ago.   Two years ago, environmentalists in the House and Senate renewedthe campaign to escalate the battle against urban smog, acid raincaused by coal-burning factories and power plants and toxic fumesfrom chemicals.   On Tuesday, they tossed in the towel, vowing to try again nextyear.   ``There has not been sufficient willingness to compromise,''said Sen. George Mitchell, D-Maine, who spent much of 1988 tryingto put together a consensus on a clean air bill. ``As a result, wewill do nothing.''   Mitchell, citing this summer's smog alerts around the country,said the technology exists to control air pollution. ``All we lackis the political will to do so.''   Among those he cited as resisting compromise were theenvironmental lobby and the two behemoths that would be mostaffected by such legislation: electric utilities and the autoindustry, domestic and foreign.   Sen. Robert Stafford, R-Vt., a veteran of clean air wars,pointed his finger at Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd, D-W.Va.,who held the Environment Committee's bill off the floor for 11months while he pushed for concessions for West Virginia's coal.   The bill's death left the nation with no new tools to combat theozone and carbon monoxide _ chiefly from vehicle emissions _ thathas grown to the point that upwards of 100 urban areas areviolating air quality standards designed to protect human health.   Also left in the dust was any new plan to deal with toxic fumesfrom chemical plants and the acid-rain chemicals produced bycoal-burning power plants and factories.   Last month, Mitchell and Richard Trumka, president of the UnitedMine Workers union, worked out an acid rain plan that favored WestVirginia's high sulfur coal industry and mandated the use ofexpensive stack gas scrubbers by about two dozen large utilities.   The proposal infuriated senators from Western states withcleaner burning, low sulphur coal. Alan Simpson, R-Wyo., threatenedto filibuster. The environmental lobby's Clean Air Coalition alsocriticized the plan, saying that no bill was better than a weak one.   Southern lawmakers were unhappy because the proposal would haveforced some of their power plants to install scrubbers to solvewhat is generally seen in the Capitol as a problem of Midwestutilities polluting the Northeast.   For its part, the utilities' lobby, the Edison ElectricInstitute, consistently said ``no'' to acid rain controls. It citedscientific disagreements over the problem and said controls shouldawait development of clean-coal technology, which is expected to becheaper than scrubbers.   Byrd issued a statement saying he was ``disappointed that acompromise on acid rain could not be reached this year that wouldboth enhance the environment and protect the economies ofcoal-producing states like West Virginia. ... I will continue towork to resolve this issue.''   The fight over acid rain was just part of the complicatedclosed-door negotiations over the clean air bill.   Another major factor in its demise was a proposal to help combaturban pollution by forcing reluctant automakers to produce vehicleswith cleaner exhaust emissions.   A key player in this area was Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., whorepresents an automaking district and who chairs the House Energyand Commerce Committee.   Dingell and clean-exhaust advocate Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif.,were unable to agree on new tailpipe standards, thus paralyzing thecommittee and keeping a clean air bill off the House floor.   Dingell and Waxman held no serious negotiations after August,taking the position that the Senate should solve its acid rainproblems and send a clean air plan to the House.   Mitchell and Dingell had even discussed a scenario under whichthe Senate would pass the basic acid rain language, the House wouldhandle the urban pollution provisions and the two bodies wouldaccept each other's product.   Matters never got to this point. Stafford said he and some otherpro-environment senators could have taken the Mitchell-Trumka planhad Byrd agreed to support the anti-smog and toxic chemicalssections.   Byrd, however, declined to make this commitment, leavingsupporters of a strong bill unwilling to leave the question ofstricter tailpipe emissions to chance and eventual negotiationswith Dingell.   Richard Ayres, chairman of the Clean Air Coalition, said theenvironmental lobby was unwilling to support the Mitchell-Trumkaplan because ``we can't recommend an acid rain program unless it isgood.''</TEXT></DOC>
