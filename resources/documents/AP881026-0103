(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Two Marine Corps helicopters crashed in adesert gunnery range during a training excercise, killing all 10servicemen aboard, officials said today.   It was not immediately known whether the two helicopterscollided, said Cpl. Darren Fuller, a public affairs spokesman at theMarine Corps Air Station in Yuma.   It was the second crash involving military helicopters this week.   The aircraft were being used in a ``troop insertion exercise''with crews using night-vision goggles when the crash occurred, saidArmy Maj. Linda Dumoulin, a Pentagon duty officer.   Four people were on a Boeing CH-46 helicopter and six on a BellUH-1N copter. Both helicopters are designed to carry more troops butwere not transporting full teams for the exercise, which Dumoulinsaid was part of a weapons-tactics instructor's course.   There were no survivors, said Fuller.   The copters went down in the remote desert site about 7:45 p.m.Tuesday approximately 125 miles southeast of the air station, saidFuller.   An investigation team was at the site, he said. Names of thevictims were being withheld pending notification of next of kin.   Yuma is about 180 miles southwest of Phoenix on the ColoradoRiver.   Monday night, a UH-1H helicopter crashed near the U.S.-Mexicoborder in California, killing the five lawmen and three NationalGuardsmen aboard during the first mission of a joint anti-drugsmuggling program.   The Army National Guard copter smashed into the rocky foothillsof the Laguna Mountains and burst into flames after striking the500,000 kilowatt power line.</TEXT></DOC>
