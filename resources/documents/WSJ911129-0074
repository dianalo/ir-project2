The list represents about $1.5 billion in trade, or about10% of the value of all U.S. imports from China in 1990. Butonly a portion of that would be selected for the retaliationif the dispute isn't resolved within a 30-day period. U.S.Trade Representative Carla Hills said the sanctions couldaffect &quot;several hundred million dollars&quot; of trade. She saidthe U.S. action would be designed to cause the &quot;least harm&quot;to U.S. industries and consumers and to Hong Kong, whileexerting the strongest pressure on China to comply with theU.S. demands. Hong Kong is a major conduit for Chineseexports.</LP><TEXT>   China can avert the blow by negotiating a settlement withthe U.S. during the 30-day period. Earlier this month, aChinese delegation led by Wu Yi, a vice minister for foreigntrade relations, offered some remedies for U.S. industrieshurt by alleged Chinese piracy of their copyrighted products.However, Mrs. Hills indicated that the negotiations remainstalemated on various patent issues.   A statement issued by the Chinese delegation said thatChina is willing to continue negotiating &quot;in a spirit ofseeking reasonable solutions to existing issues.&quot; Assertingthat China had offered &quot;major and substantial concessions,&quot;the statement said the prospective sanctions wouldn't be&quot;fair,&quot; or in conformity with &quot;normal internationalpractices.&quot;   The U.S. business community also reacted warily to theprospect that punitive tariffs, which could run as high as100%, might be levied on portions of the China trade. TheU.S.-China Business Council, which represents Americancompanies that trade with China, warned that the sanctionscould seriously hurt some U.S. consumers.   Petroleum products are collectively the highest-valuedChinese export to the U.S., amounting to $635 million in1990. If the U.S. slaps the steep duties on them, West Coastbuyers of Chinese motor fuels would be forced to seek lessexpensive sources.   The U.S. trade office included a large number of apparelitems in the list, but it was careful to pick only items thataren't covered by U.S. import quotas or by other rulesgoverning the international textile trade. The listedgarments include windbreakers, blazers, shorts, nightwear,bathrobes and scarves that are mostly made out of silk.However, U.S. textile buyers still complained that apparelwould be a poor choice for retaliation.   &quot;By targeting apparel, we could be hurting people who havenothing to do with the intellectual-property issues which arethe subject of this investigation,&quot; asserted Martin Lewin, alawyer for the U.S. Association of Importers of Textiles andApparel. &quot;We are also likely to harm entrepreneurs in HongKong whom we don't want to harm.&quot;   The list also includes rubber footwear, radiotape-players, malt-based beer, aluminum ores andconcentrates, suitcases and briefcases, pipe fittings, vacuumcleaners, floor polishers, radio transceivers andwristwatches.</TEXT></DOC>
