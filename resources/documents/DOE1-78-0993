<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-78-0993 </DOCNO><TEXT>Effects of impurities and microprocesses on the creep of natural saltsamples are presented. Salts are analyzed from four sites (Palo DuroUnit 4 and Palo Duro Unit 5, Texas; Avery Island, Louisiana; and SalinaBasin, Michigan). The salts have been deformed at temperatures and pressuresthat simulate repository conditions. Bulk chemistry, optical petrology,and microprobe analyses are used to identify the species and to quantifythe amount of each impurity. General effects of impurities on the rheologyof natural salt are discussed. The physical processes that control creepdeformation of salt are identified by etchpit techniques. The natureof desolation motion which controls the creep behavior of salt changesdramatically over the temperature range of 25 to 200{degree}C. Physicalbases for constitutive modeling are established through observationsdocumented in this report. Composition of the salts range from nearlypure, uniform halite to a heterogeneous composite of halite and anhydrite.Impurities evidently increase creep resistance at lower test temperatures.At higher test temperatures, creep deformation is much less sensitiveto the presence of impurities. Anhydrite is the only mineral speciesthat correlates strongly with creep response. Generally, greater amountsof anhydrite increase the creep resistance. 13 refs., 11 figs., 12 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
