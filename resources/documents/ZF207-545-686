(chart)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>PLANNED OR INHERITED, THE MESS IN DP IS REALandM;Distributed databases and heterogeneous databases have some similarities.andO;But they have bigger differences.andM;The term &quot;distributed databases&quot; implies pre-planning.andP;  It means that frominception there was a plan to distriute data in a meaningful, wellthought-out way.andP;  The DBMS includes a data dictionary/directory that quicklyindicates where particular data resides.andM;Heterogeneous databases, on the other hand, imply the mess of file structuresthat we inherited.andP;  Extensive digging by database administrators (DBAs)eventually tells us where particular data is located.andM;Heterogeneous databases are the real world which we live in.andM;&quot;Anytime someone uses the term 'heterogeneous' or 'distributed,' ask themprecisely what they mean,&quot; advises Esther Dyson, editor of Release 1.0, anewsletter based in New York.andM;&quot;Those words, as well as 'interoperability' and 'open systems,' are used inmany different ways,&quot; she warns.andM;To a lot of people, heterogeneous databases are the ones that evolved overtime.andP;  As the result of years of effort, a lot of production data resides inIMS.andM;Now, an important set of data resides in DB2 for end-user queries.andP;  But a lotof valuable data still exists in old flat files.andM;And that is just the heterogeneous IBM world.andP;  A lot more heterogeneousdatabase software is out there.andM;A heterogeneous environment can mean a mix of different hardware and/orsoftware.andP;  When the term &quot;heterogeneous databases&quot; is used, however, itusually means: different database software, dissimilar access methods,incompatible data models and distinctly separate vendors.andM;When planning for a distributed database architecture, the designersgenerally would opt for the same database management system to be installedthroughout the distributed network.andP;  Some DBMSs require the same hardwarethroughout the network.andP;  Others, like the relational database Oracle, fromthe vendor of the same name located in Belmont, Calif., can reside on a widevariety of platforms.andM;But generally, the DBMS software is the same throughout the system.andP;  Thismeans the overall data model is the same everywhere in the distributedarchitecture.andP;  In heterogeneous DBMS systems, the data models are oftendifferent.andM;&quot;With heterogeneous databases,&quot; says David Hicks, director of technology forAMD Consulting in Tampa, Fla., &quot;you have several database managers active atone time--not because it was designed to be that way, but just because ithappened.&quot;andP;  AMD specializes in consulting services for companies in the dataprocessing industry.andM;GROWING NEED FOR SHARED DATAandM;The fact that little or no strategic data planning was done and differentdata models were used is a major problem when there is a need to share dataamong systems.andM;And that is a growing need.andM;Corporations that have production data in hierarchical or inverted listdatabases are storing a lot of the same data in relational systems where endusers can easily access it.andP;  Every day more data is being put into relationalsystems and is growing in strategic importance.andM;Many companies now have several relational systems.andP;  Many firms have DB2,partly because they have a lot of production data in IMS and are able to useIBM's Data Extract (DXT) software to copy IMS data into DB2.andM;Now, however, they might also have Oracle, Ingres from Relational Technology,alameda, Calif., or Sybase from the vendor of the same name based inEmeryville, Calif., because of specifc, unique features offered by thatproduct.andM;Many times the same data appears in several databases--meaning a lot of dataduplication.andM;The need to avoid further data replication and the errors it introduces is amajor incentive for data sharing.andP;  This leads to the need to access data fromall the heterogeneous databases that have sprung up within an enterprise.andM;Sometimes the data replication could have been avoided if users were able toaccess data from several different systems with a single query.andM;Many systems were installed for specific functional areas within a company.andO;Separate systems were created for purchasing, finance, manufacturing,inventory control, payroll and personnel.andP;  If an end user needed data fromeach of these systems, often a brand-new system was built.andP;  The data fromexisting systems might have been interfaced, imported, downloaded, uploadedor re-entered for the new system.andM;In the past, the data for the new system would have been stored in a newdatabase structure.andP;  However, new approaches are becoming available.andM;&quot;Increasingly, we are seeing new ways to more easily access the data--whenand as we need it,&quot; says Tim Fisher of Attachmate, Bellevue, Wash.andP;  (Seerelated sidebar on Attachmate's Autoware.)andM;&quot;We do not have to create a new database structure to house the data for anew application.andP;  We just access the data for the specific need or query orreport,&quot; he said.andM;&quot;Data processing is becoming more connected,&quot; says Dyson.andP;  &quot;We are findingways to cross over all kinds of boundaries.andP;  The world is becoming a moreintegrated place.&quot;andM;EDI, SAA CONNECTIONSandM;Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) and IBM's Systems Application Architecture(SAA) are examples of this higher integration.andP;  EDI is being usedincreasingly between companies for automatic ordering and billing, while SAAis an effort to achieve uniformity across IBM systems.andM;Just how much SAA will help with accessing heterogeneous databases remains tobe seen, but it is a step in the right direction.andP;  So is IBM's DataRepository.andP;  And other things are happening within IBM.andM;IBM has invested $10 million in Metaphor Computer Systems, Inc., a MountainView, Calif., a software supplier specializing in integrating data fordecision-making purposes.andP;  IBM and Metaphor are jointly developing Metaphor'sData Interpretation System, an executive information system to operate onPS/2 Models 70 and 80, and smaller machines with an add-in board.andM;&quot;Metaphor's Data Interpretation System,&quot; says Metaphor president Don Massaro,&quot;previously had only operated on its own workstations built around MotorolaInc.'s 68000 microprocessor.&quot;andM;The alliance benefits IBM because it can build its own applications on top ofthe Metaphor layer.andP;  The benefit to Metaphor is an expanded customer base.andM;The system can retrieve data from corporate mainframes, database services andother outside sources, such as census data, A.C.andP;  Nielsen data services andothers.andP;  It has been popular among consumer marketing firms, banking andfinancial industries, and pharmaceutical companies.andM;&quot;Design specifications for Metaphor systems,&quot; says Massaro, &quot;originated frommarket research carried out in end-user organizations within Fortune 500companies.andP;  The research indicated that large amounts of computer-generateddata was being accessed, but there were many problems.andM;&quot;Data frequently was not in a form or location where it could be easilyaccessed by end users,&quot; continues Massaro.andP;  &quot;While 4GLs were available, endusers rarely became fluent in these languages and had to rely on predefined4GL applications defined by MIS.andP;  Metaphor set out to address many of theseproblems.&quot;andM;Data access from a variety of existing relational database management systemsis facilitated by Metaphor through database gateways.andM;&quot;The gateways perform data conversions and any other activities required tomake dta from diverse data sources appear homogeneous,&quot; adds Massaro.andP;  &quot;Withthe use of mouse-driven tools and graphical interfaces, end users can easilymaster the Metaphor system.&quot;andM;DOD'S CALS DRIVING INTEGRATIONandM;A major integration effort is taking place in the defense industry.andP;  TheDepartment of Defense (DOD) is pursuing a goal of an Integrated Weapon SystemData Base (IWSDB) as part of its Computer-aided Acquisition and LogisticsSystem (Cals).andM;Cals is intended to serve as a catalyst to accelerate the progress of privateindustry toward industrial networking.andM;While there are numerous benefits to be gained from the far-ranging Calsprogram--like replacing tons of paper documents with digitized datatransfer--a major goal is to integrate data about a weapon system.andM;Since DOD is paying for development, it should be able to access data fromany heterogeneous weapons system database from the contractor who builds thesystem.andM;But in the long-range plan, the DOD wants to be able to access data not onlyfrom the prime contractor, but also from any of the heterogeneous weaponssystems databases from diverse sub-contractor sites as well.andM;Standards for Cals are being established for all defense contractors.andM;IGES and PDES--standards efforts supported by the industry--are directlyrelated to Cals.andP;  IGES, the Initial Graphics Exchange Specification, isbeginning to permit intersystem data transfer between CAD/CAM vendors.andP;  PDES,the Product Data Exchange Specification goes much further.andM;An over-simplified explanation would say PDES creates basic conceptual datamodels of manufactured entities, or products.andP;  Conceivably, these conceptualmodels could become industry standards for representing the basic datainvolved in the models' entities.andM;The mission of the PDES project is to establish an accepted definition of thedata that constitutes a complete product definition and support.andP;  One goal ofPDES is to permit sharing of data throughout the life cycle of aproduct--despite the heterogeneous forms of the data.andM;&quot;A product is usually regarded as a manufacturing item,c says Yuhwei Yang, aLong Beach, Calif.-based consultant with D. Appleton Company.andP;  Though you canconsider any major resulting item within business as a product, Yangexplains, most of the product definition work in PDES revolves aroundmanufactured products.andM;Yang, a supporter of both PDES and Cals, has been active in projects whichpreceded Cals.andM;While Cals was formally started in 1985, there were many people working onsimilar projects prior to that.andP;  A lot of these people believe that theirwork has made major contributions to what Cals is today.andM;The Air Force's Integrated Computer-aided Manufacturing project was startedin the early 1970s.andP;  It gave birth to several programs like the IntegratedInformation Support System, the Integrated Design Support System (IDS), theFactory of the Future and others.andM;GETTING DATABASES TO COOPERATEandM;These systems were all concerned with integrating information needs fordefense contractors involved in the design and production of weapons systems.andO;A major concern was to be able to communicate data across heterogeneousdatabase environments.andM;Rockwell International in El Segundo, Calif., heads the consortium of defensecontractors and consultants who are developing the Integrated Design SupportSystem.andP;  IDS is sponsored by the Air Force Wright Aeronautical laboratoriesof Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio.andM;Nick Bernstein, the Air Force IDS program manager for many years, says, &quot;IDSwas a major force in instigating the Cals effort.andP;  A lot of the IDSparticipants were principal players in the early Cals meetings.&quot;andM;Other industries are following the IDS and Cals efforts because they havemany of the same concerns.andP;  They need to access heterogeneous databases aswell.andP;  Many manufacturing companies can identify with the &quot;islands ofautomation&quot; that IDS and Cals are trying to tie together.andM;To encourage widespread industry participation, IDS formed a TechnicalAdvisory Group (TAG) consisting of both aerospace defense contractors andother industry representatives.andM;&quot;The TAG meets three times a year,&quot; says Bernstein.andP;  &quot;IDS shows them what isbeing accomplished on the program and gets their comments, suggestions andconstructive criticisms.andP;  We've had over 100 different representatives fromdifferent companies.andM;&quot;People come from non-defense industries because they have similar problems.andO;For example, some folks came down from the information systems group at Fordin Detroit because they were interested in doing some similar things,&quot; hesaid.andM;THREE-SCHEMA APPROACHandM;IDS suports the three-schema approach to database management systems asrecommended by the American National Standard Institute (Ansi) in themid-1970s.andP;  The three schemas are the external, conceptual and internalschemas.andM;The external schema represents the user or application program view.andP;  Theinternal schema represents the physical storage of the data within thecomputer system.andP;  The conceptual schema represents a neutral orenterprise-wide logical view of the relationships of all data in thedatabase.andP;  All activity for the external and internal schemas go through theconceptual schema.andM;The conceptual schema can satisfy the requirements of all user views.andP;  It isthe conceptual schema or common view of data which offers an integratingcapability.andP;  Once the conceptual schema is defined, new access paths toexisting data in heterogeneous databases can be more easily achieved.andM;Dan Appleton, founder of D. Appleton Company, Inc. (Dacom) of ManhattanBeach, Calif., has been an advocate of the three-schema approach tointegrated information resource management (which he refers to as InformationAsset Management).andP;  Dacom is a contributor to both IDS and Cals.andM;The IDS project was one of the earliest large projects to perform extensivedata modeling for a conceptual schema.andP;  Rick Bshara of Rockwell and otherdesigners of the IDS Product Data Control Model (PDCM)--the IDS conceptualdata model--have made major contributions to the art of data modeling.andM;The IDS Product Data Control Model has also contributed to the PDES datamodeling effort.andM;Bob Fulton, who serves as executive officer of the IDSTAG and is a member ofthe Cals industry steering group, says, &quot;IDS has provided a set of baselineapproaches for modeling engineering products.andP;  Its Product Data Control Modelwas really forward-thinking and has been used as a baseline in many projects.andM;&quot;Also, IDS' work on data dictionaries and other concepts have been a majorcontribution,&quot; he said.andM;Fulton, professor of mechanical engineering at the Georgia Institute ofTechnology in Atlanta, adds, &quot;The IDS program is especially beneficial in notonly developing scenarios and examples of the need for heterogeneous access,but also in demonstrating how it could be done.andP;  It provides excellentproof-of-concept demonstration.andP;  The demonstration also illustrates problemsinvolved in developing automobiles, computers and other complex products.andM;&quot;IDS has brought together key players in industry to synergize their views onhow to solve these problems,&quot; Fulton says.andP;  &quot;It provides a test bed whereusers and the providers of technology can work together in realisticenvironments.andM;&quot;Too often, end users and computer scientists have not communicatedadequately.andP;  IDS offers an environment for joint development.andP;  That's whyprojects like this are absolutely essential if we are going to make progress.andM;&quot;Some of the key participants in the Cals program,&quot; he continued, &quot;have beeninvolved in IDS.andP;  The IDS program has been a key feeder into the Calsprogram.&quot;andM;An early effort to access data from heterogeneous databases within the IDSprogram involved Multibase, a research DBMS created by Computer Corporationof America, Cambridge, Mass., and recently sold to Xerox Corp., Los Angeles.andO;(See HI-OLTP sidebar.)andM;IDS was charged with developing scenarios which demonstrated the need for andways to achieve heterogeneous database access.andP;  These demonstrations,presented three times a year for the Technical Advisory Group, providedworking, proof-of-concept demonstrations of various approaches.andM;In a demonstration of heterogeneous access a few years ago, IDS usedMultibase to access technical data from IMS and Oracle as well as engineeringdata from RIM.andP;  (RIM, Boeing Computer Services' Relational InformationManager, is widely used for tying together engineering files and databases.)andM;In addition, special technical data stored in the Local Data Manager (LDM),Multibase's internal DBMS, was accessed as well.andM;Bill Putnam, IDS program technical director and an innovator within IDS,says, &quot;At the time, we had LDIs [Local Data Interfaces] for RIM and Oracle.andO;We also wanted to access IMS.andP;  Focus can access IMS, so we wrote an LDI forFocus.andM;&quot;We had one query that went across four databases,&quot; says Putnam.andP;  &quot;It wentinto Focus, RIM, Oracle and Multibasehs own LDM.andP;  Focus went into IMS.&quot;andM;Putnam says the Multibase research product proved to be too slow and tooexpensive to put a system together.andM;&quot;We have a commercial product now,&quot; says Putnam, &quot;Oracle is doing it for us.&quot;andM;According to Rita Bergman, director of business development at Xerox AdvancedInformation Technology, McLean, Va., &quot;With Oracle, the end user needs to knowwhere the data resides.andP;  With Multibase, the user does not have to know wherethe data is located.andP;  When you have the system locate the data for you, youhave to give it time to do that.&quot;andM;Bruce Lepisto, deputy director of Cals, says, &quot;Rockwell is working toimplement some of the IDS concepts into production mode.&quot;andM;Under the circumstances, Rockwell needs the speed of Oracle.andM;Both Oracle and Focus have become major players in the game of accessingheterogeneous databases.andP;  But many other 4GLs and DBMSs provide some kind ofaccess to external database systems.andM;Nomad from Dandamp;B Computing, Danbury, Conn.; Focus from Information Builders,New York; and Ramis from On-Line Software International, Ft.andP;  Lee, N.J., haveprovided access to IMS, IDMS, Model 204, Vsam and other systems for years.andM;Adabas from Software AG, Reston, Va., and Supra from cincom, Inc.,andO;Cincinnati, were some of the earliest systems to provide access and updatecapabilities to external databases.andM;Supra is based on the Ansi three-schema concept with a conceptual schemaproviding a unifying, integrating mechanism for diverse data sources.andM;Dick Heermance, product line marketing manager for Informix Software, Inc.,andO;Menlo Park, Calif., says Informix supports CL/1, the connectively languagefrom Network Innovations, Corp., Cupertino, Calif., an independent subsidiaryof Apple Computer.andP;  This can provide access to SQL/DS or DB2 in the mainframeenvironment as well as Ingres, Oracle, Sybase and RDB in the Digital VAXenvironment.andM;Frank Strelau, product marketing manager of Gateway products for RelationalTechnology says, &quot;Our basic philosophy is a two-phase approach to coexistencewith other systems.andP;  The main relational systems are our goal in Phase I.andP;  InPhase II we'll extend that to non-relational data like IMS on the IBMmainframe.&quot;andM;&quot;Sybase's Open Server,&quot; says Rich Scheffer, director of marketing for Sybase,&quot;is our strategic direction for connecting heterogeneous software.andP;  We willprovide the Open Server connectivity capabilities in the form of a gatewaytool kit.&quot;andP;  Open Server is expected to be available later this year.andM;&quot;Focus has the most extensive database access capabilities of any 4GLsoftware on the market,&quot; says David Kemler, vice president of marketing andsales at Information Builders.andP;  &quot;And that's true no matter what platformyou're talking about.andP;  Information Builders has had the bigger picture ofheterogeneous database access in mind for along time.&quot;andM;Focus can access data from any major DBMS platform, including DB2, SQL/DS,IMS, Vsam, the OS/400 native DBMS and OS/2 Extended Edition Database Manager.andM;&quot;Focus allows users to access a number of data sources simultaneously,&quot; saysKemler, &quot;through dynamic relational joins.andP;  These join operations can link upto 16 different tables and databases at one time.andM;&quot;With SAA communications protocols and the Focus client/server architecture,users will be able to offload processing from mainframes onto workstations ina cooperative processing mode,&quot; explains Kemler.andM;Focus is also available for VAX, Hewlett-PAckard, Tandem, Wang and a host ofUnix-based systems, including Sun, Apollo, Sequent and Pyramid.andP;  Theapplications developed for one system are portable and can be run on any ofthe other systems.andM;Information Builders is using Focnet to perform some interesting integrationfeats.andP;  Focnet is the vendor's product line which connects allFocus-supported hardware platforms.andM;&quot;Focnet currently connects DEC VAXs running VMS with IBM mainframes runningthe MVS or VM/CMS operating systems,&quot; says Kemler.andP;  &quot;Using a Remote QueryExecution facility, VAX users can cause a set of Focus statements to beexecuted on a remote IBM machine.&quot;andM;The Focnet/Interlink Interface, developed with Interlink Computer Sciences,Fremont, Calif., provides VAX users with transparent access to all IBMresident files, including IMS, DB2, and SQL/DS, and to proprietary databases,such as Adabas from Software AG; IDMS from Cullinet Software Inc., Westwood,Mass., (recently acquired by Computer Associates, Garden City, N.Y.); Totalfrom Cincom; Model 204 from CCA; and CA-Datacom from Computer Associates.andM;Interlink develops high-speed connectivity products for multi-vendorcomputing environments.andM;Oracle, which is now used in the IDS program to access heterogeneousdatabases, provides integration capability with SQL*Connect.andP;  SQL*Connect isthe collective name for Oracle's family of gateways that enable Oracle toaccess external databases and file systems.andM;A spokesman for Oracle said SQL*Connect can retrieve data from Vsam files,IMS, DB2, SQL/DS or VAX RDBMS.andP;  For example, PAcific Power and Light usesOracle for distributed access across IBM mainframes, DEC VAXs, Sunworkstations, PCs and Macintosh IIs, the spokesman said.andM;DATA DICTIONARIESandM;Data dictionaries have often been sought as a potential aid in resolving theheterogeneous data access problem.andP;  For example, the Oracle data dictionarytracks the location of data within an emerging distributed architecture.andM;Pat Blakely, data administrator for General Dynamics Valley Systems in RanchoCucamonga, Calif., is going to use Cullinet's Integrated Data Dictionary(IDD) as a centralized data repository.andP;  &quot;We will take updates from thePanvalet library and use them to updata the IDD, reflecting the latestdevelopments,&quot; she said.andP;  Her heterogeneous environment includes IMS, Model204, Oracle and flat files.andM;Blakely looks for her guidance from Jeff Wilson, manager of DataAdministration for the Electronics Division of General Dynamics in San Diego.andM;Wilson already has a successful IDD installation running for the ElectronicsDivision and will be providing assistance to Blakeley.andM;Wilson, working with Ray Hollenbach, General Dynamichs director ofApplication Development, initiated GD's Integration Technology project inlate 1986.andM;This project, a true corporate-wide, cooperative team effort, created aTechnical Requirements Specification for an Active Data Dictionary/DirectorySystem to provide access to data in a heterogeneous environment and to treatdata as a corporate asset.andM;The document was sent out to over 160 companies, universities and governmentagencies last year as a request for information.andP;  The feedback was rewarding,encouraging and interesting.andM;Hollenbach says that Michael McClure, data management manager for BoeingCommercial Airplanes, recommended that the Aerospace Industry Associatesaccept an augmented version of the GD requirements as a statement ofdirection for data dictionary/directories.andM;&quot;dictionary users said this is just what we need,&quot; says Hollenbach.andP;  &quot;Butmany dictionary vendors said, 'It's beyond the state of the art.'&quot;andM;Hollenbach said vendor comments ranged from &quot;something like this coulddestroy industrial vendor competitiveness&quot; and &quot;it's pie in the sky&quot; to &quot;itwill evolve over time&quot; and &quot;this is the real basis of heterogeneousinteraction.&quot;andM;(A copy of the TEchnical Requirements Specification can be obtained from DonAllerton, corporate-wide application technology specialist, General Dynamics,St. Louis.eandM;AN INTEGRATION CANDIDATEandM;A key player in dictionary software is Manager Software Products (MSP), basedin Lexington, Mass.andP;  MSP's Manager family of software products is oftenregarded as a candidate for integrating the diverse data resources of anenterprise.andM;There are many attrative features to MSP products, including universality.andO;While many data dictionaries are tied to a specific DBMS software package,MSP products are designed to interact with many database packages.andM;The Manager family of tools provides an environment in which the informationresources can effectively be modeled and administered.andP;  This family ofproducts is driven off one common communication switch--the CorporateDictionary/Repository.andM;The MSP architecture enables an organization to establish and maintain aCorporate Data Model based on views captured from people throughout theorganization.andM;MSP tools can provide database definition and generation for IMS/DB, DB2,DL/1, Total, IDMS, SQL/DS, S200, Adabas and other database managementsystems.andM;&quot;MSP is a significant step in the right direction,&quot; says David Hicks of AMDConsulting.andM;Many hope that the Information Resource Dictionary System (IRDS)standardization effort is a step in the right direction as well.andP;  The IRDSstandard is being developed by the American National Standards Institute andthe National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).andM;Alan Goldfine, project manager for the IRDS at NIST says, &quot;It provides astandardized means of describing meta-data (data about data) that can then beused to describe any appropriate environment involved.&quot;andM;Ray Hollenbach and Don Allerton of General Dynamics feel that the IRDS isserving a useful role in establishing standards for dictionary/directorytrends.andP;  Hollenbach notes that it supports the Ansi three-schema concept.andM;(A new NIST publication, IRDS: An Integration Mechanism for Product DataExchange Specification, describes the three-schema architecture as well asthe connection between the IRDS and PDES.)andM;One of the criticisms of the standard from the DP industry is that the IRDSstandard was developed mostly by representatives from vendors of datadictionaries.andM;The standards committee was open to anyone, yet only a few companies besidesthe dictionary vendors became actively involved.andP;  Among those vendors wereGTE Government Systems Corp., the Mitre Corp., Lawrence Berkeley Laboratoryand Bell Communication Research (Bellcore), the research arm of the ATandamp;Ttelephone companies.andM;&quot;INCOMPREHENSIBLE&quot; READINGandM;Another problem, pointed out by both Hicks of AMD Consulting and Greg Brownof General Dynamics, Pomona, Calif., is that the average DP professional hasdifficulty reading IRDS specifications.andM;Brown, data administrator for GD's Pomona/Valley Division, says, &quot;They'vedone a good job of making the user interface consistent and given a lot ofattention to exporting and importing data between different dictionaries.andP;  Infact, they have included a lot of detail for many areas.andP;  However, it's noteasy to read.&quot;andM;Hicks agrees.andP;  &quot;I can't take an average DP person and explain what the IRDSis,&quot; says Hicks.andP;  &quot;The product is incomprehensible.&quot;andM;Hicks feels the problem comes down to funding.andP;  &quot;Someone needs to fund acommittee that consists of real dictionary users,&quot;  says Hicks.andM;Brown adds, &quot;Reading about the IRDS is like reading a legal piece ofdocumentation.&quot;andM;Goldfine says, &quot;We recognize this.andP;  The standard itself is 764 pages long.&quot;andO;He says a briefer description will be procided soon.andM;Goldfine said that Mohan Prabandham of CGI Systems, McLean, Va., isspearheading an effort to create a 30-to-40-page document called the &quot;IRDSReference Model.&quot;andP;  It will place the IRDS in perspective, saying how to fitit into a DP environment and how to go about using it.andM;&quot;At the current time,&quot; notes Golfine, &quot;some additional publications we haveavailable are: A Technical Overview of the IRDS, A Guide to IRDS Applicationsand Using the IRDS Command Language.andM;(More information about these publications can be obtained from Goldfine atthe National Institute of Standards and Technology, in Gaithersburg, Md.)andM;Another interesting and unique approach to heterogeneous database access isthe concept of a virtual database management system (VDBMS)--a &quot;no data&quot;database.andM;&quot;We are using G-Base, our object-oriented database management system, as avirtual data dictionary/directory,&quot; says Rex Hancock, senior account managerwith Graphael, Inc., based in Waltham, Mass.andM;As the name implies, a virtual DBMS has no data in it.andP;  It, in effect,&quot;points&quot; to the data.andM;&quot;A VDBMS is a database of objects without real data,&quot; explains JeffSutherland, vice president, engineering.andP;  &quot;When a message is sent to anobject in a VDBMS, methods within the object trigger requests to ameta-object.andP;  Meta-objects, in turn, send messages to receiver objects whichrequest data from multiple nodes on the enterprise network.&quot;andM;An object-oriented method is similar to a procedure.andP;  (See software Magazine,June Special issue.)andM;&quot;G-Base allows you to build on the Ansi three-schema architecture,&quot; saysSutherland.andM;The individual user views, or external schemas, would go through theconceptual schema, represented in the VDBMS.andP;  The conceptual schema VDBMSwould send a message to the data in the internal schemas--or individual,heterogeneous data locations--to retrieve data.andP;  When the data is received,receiver objects in the VDBMS conceptual schema pass the data to meta-objectswhich translate and instantiate requestor objects in the external schema.andM;Object-oriented systems will be used in the future to help integrate theheterogeneous multimedia information that enterprises will increasingly needto access.andM;What is the overall prognosis for the future?andM;Will we see more tools and techniques to help us integrate our increasinglydiverse resources?andM;&quot;Yes,&quot; says Esther Dyson.andM;We've come a long way, but we seem to have new problems all the time.andP;  willwe ever solve the problems of heterogeneous database access?andP;  Can we reallyget there from here?andM;&quot;Yes, we will get there,&quot; Dyson assures us.andP;  &quot;We will eventually solve theproblems of heterogeneous database access.&quot;andM;However, she makes an additional observation.andM;&quot;And then we will have new problems to face,&quot; Dyson counsels.andP;  &quot;Dataprocessing people will never run out of problems.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
