Italian law forbids sale or supply of arms to Iraq or to Iran,which have been at war in the Persian Gulf since September 1980.Officials here said two men were arrested and a third was sought.   The shipments were halted with the March 24 seizure at Rome'sLeonardo da Vinci airport of nearly 27 tons of bomb parts about tobe loaded on an Iraqi Airways jet bound for Baghdad, said officialsof the carabinieri, Italy's paramilitary police force.   An added 33 tons of parts, waiting to be transported to theairport and eventually to Iraq, also were seized recently in Italy,the police said.   Customs declarations were falsified to describe the componentsas parts for furniture or spare parts for home appliances orplumbing repair, the police said, speaking on condition ofanonymity.   They said documents examined by police showed the Iraqi Ministryof Planning ordered the shipments and the Iraqi governmentprovided, for export agents in Rome, a letter of credit for $8million to cover dealings with Italian factories manufacturing theparts.   Cluster bombs, designed to spread shrapnel over a wide area, arean effective anti-personnel weapon. Iraq has used such bombs tobreak up mass Iranian ground assaults. Iran says Iraq droppedcluster bombs in Kurdistan against villages which it says were alsohit by chemical bombs March 16-17.   Police reported finding Iraqi government documents outliningwhich components were needed for the cluster bombs.   A police official said other bomb components, 16 tons in all,were seized at 27 small factories that received the Iraqi orders. Afew factories are in the Milan area; others are in Tuscany.   No one answered at the Iraqi Embassy in Rome when called forcomment.   Police said Thursday the two men arrested were charged withconstruction, export and illegal holding of war arms. Both workedfor an import-export firm in Rome that police said arranged thebomb parts delivery.   Officers identified them as Iraqi-born Ahmad Al Kodasi, 30, anItalian citizen, and Hamoudi Jaffar Kasim, 21, of Baghdad.   Police said they a third man sought is an Iraqi.   They said no charges have been brought against factory officials.   The parts ranged from metal tubes and cones, which the factoriesdescribed as plumbing pieces, to plastic connecting parts listed onthe inventory as table legs, police said.   Several investigations are being carried out in Italy into thealleged supply of weapons to Iran by Italian arms manufacturers.</TEXT></DOC>
