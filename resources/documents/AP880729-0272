Statements by Subroto, who heads the 13-nation Organization ofPetroleum Exporting Countries, were published in the United ArabEmirates newspaper Al-Ittihad.   Subroto was in the emirates for discussions on the oil marketsituation with U.A.E. leaders in advance of an OPEC pricingcommittee meeting in Lausanne, Switzerland on Aug. 3.   The state-run Al-Ittihad quoted Subroto as saying the worldmarket ``looks forward to positive results'' from the pricingcommittee. It said he expressed his expectation of an increase inoil prices over the coming weeks.   In Subroto's view, the paper said, prices have been improvingbecause of the prospects of a peaceful end to the nearly 8-year-oldwar between Iran and Iraq.   That settlement would lead to a positive impact on the oilmarket and oil prices, the paper further quoted Subroto as saying.   But it said he could not predict whether prices would increasebeyond the OPEC benchmark of $18 a barrel.   The pricing committee, whose members are oil ministers of SaudiArabia, Nigeria, Indonesia, Algeria and Venezuela, was meeting inwake of Iran's decision to accept a U.N. Security Councilcease-fire resolution to end its war with Iraq.   Subroto has toured OPEC member states seeking assurances aboutcompliance with the cartel's production quotas to help stabilizeoil prices around the $18 benchmark.   Because of the war, Iraq has refused to accept its OPEC-decreedquota and produces almost double what it is assigned. Meanwhile,Iran is widely accused of discounting prices to market its crudeoil under the wartime conditions.   That could change if the war came to an end, fueling hopes thatprices could rise.   Other OPEC member states have also violated the cartel'sproduction and pricing rules.   In June, the U.A.E. said it would ignore its OPEC oil productionquota of 948,000 barrels and produce about 1.5 million barrels perday.   Subroto has conferred with U.A.E. Oil Minister Mana Saeed Otaibaand with U.A.E. President Sheik Zayed Bin Sultan Al-Nahyan to whomhe delivered a message from the OPEC president and Nigerian oilminister, Rilwanu Lukman.   The official Emirates news agency WAM reported after themeetings Thursday that Sheik Zayed affirmed his nation's supportfor ``unity and cohesion'' within OPEC.</TEXT></DOC>
