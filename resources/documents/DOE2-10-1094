Next, we build SUSY' algebra and representations (particularly,field representation). We then introduce the conceots of superspace andsuperfield, as well as supermultiplets and their invariants. Our nextstep is to examine simple models, in order to study auxiliary fieldsand the off-shell representations, to calculate the super-current andto show with super-graphs the loops cancelation (Wess-Zumino) and SUSYbreaking (O'Raifeartaigh). Next, we obtain the supersymetric extensionof the QED Lagrangean in to different ways, and them we are able to investigatesymmetry breaking in supersymmetric gauge theories, and the appearanceof Goldstone fermions. Finally, we study n-extended SUSY and the roleof central charges, and examine SUSY in d andgt; 4 dimensions and dimensionalreduction. We end up with an introduction to Lie groups.</TEXT></DOC>
