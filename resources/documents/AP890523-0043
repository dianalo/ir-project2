Chief Says Honduras Blocking Deployment of U.N. Observers</HEAD><BYLINE>By PETER JAMES SPIELMANN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Honduras is blocking a U.N. plan to deploymilitary observers who would try to stop cross-border attacks byrebels fighting the Salvadoran and Nicaraguan governments, the U.N.secretary-general said.   Javier Perez de Cuellar made the comments in a letter last monthto five Central American countries. The correspondence, releasedMonday, was part of an exchange of letters on the issue.   U.N. officials have drawn up a plan to send about 100 militaryobservers and 60 pilots, drivers and administrators to monitorCentral American border areas, especially the Nicaragua-Hondurasand El Salvador-Honduras borders.   Up to 11,000 Nicaraguan rebels, known as Contras and receivingsupport from the United States, operate from bases in Honduras.   El Salvador says rebels fighting its government operate frombases in Honduras _ without the Honduran government's permission _and that Nicaragua supplies the Salvadoran insurgents.   Foreign Minister Carlos Lopez Contreras of Honduras sent Perezde Cuellar a handwritten note, also released Monday, that said hiscountry would agree to the border patrols only if Nicaragua drops acase it has filed in the World Court against Honduras.   Nicaragua made public a letter in which it said the World Courtruled unanimously in December that Nicaragua has the right topursue its case, which accuses Honduras of cooperating with theContras.   Nicaragua's foreign minister, Miguel d'Escoto, said in theletter that Honduras has tried for two years to ``sabotage thecreation and establishment'' of a U.N. border patrol.   Perez de Cuellar said in his letter that he could not send theU.N. observers if Honduras links their deployment to ``conditionsover whose fulfillment I have no control.''   The letter, sent to the foreign ministers of Honduras,Nicaragua, Guatemala, El Salvador and Costa Rica, did not mentionNicaragua's case in the World Court.   Canada, Spain and West Germany have agreed to send personnel toparticipate in the border patrol and the U.N. draft calls for atleast one Latin American contingent.   Venezuela is ``under active consideration,'' said a U.N.diplomat who spoke on condition of anonymity.</TEXT></DOC>
