Among the possible changes being reviewed is the concept of making insider-trading charges applicable to those trading on the certainty a company will develop technologies and products that will favorably affect its business or share-price performance, the ministry official said.    This approach is designed to address instances where individuals are privy to confidential information regarding technological or product announcements that aren't available to the general public.    Another general concept involves extending the insider-trading definition to include cases where individuals trade on technology or product information if the company expects a sales increase.    The ministry official emphasized that both potential changes are under study and haven't been approved for enactment into law. He declined to estimate when further action can be expected.    The changes being considered are separate from far-reaching insider-trading legislation the ministry submitted to Japan's parliament in March. The package, expected to be passed by late spring, would make insider trading punishable as a criminal rather than a civil offense as now provided under law. It also would narrow the definition of professional positions and conduct in connection with securities information or transactions that fall under the definition of insider trading, based on a forthcoming amendment to Article 58 of the country's securities and exchange law.    The sweeping changes in Japan's insider-trading regulations are an outgrowth of an incident last September, in which the share price of a medium-sized Japanese chemical maker on the Tokyo exchange mysteriously fell before its announcement of multibillion-yen losses in Japanese government bond futures trading. Foreign calls for an upgrading of Japan's surveillance and prosecutorial capability in the context of shared information in global insider-trading cases also encouraged revisions. </TEXT></DOC>
