<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-79-0300 </DOCNO><TEXT>We have propagated transverse sound in a magnetic field in the basal planeof UPt{sub 3}, with the polarization vector oriented both in the basal-planeand perpendicular to it. We observe a strong anisotropy in the magneticfield dependence of the attenuation for the two polarizations. In a simplephenomenological model we can understand the low temperature field dependenceas a natural consequence of the anisotropy with temperature in zero-fieldreported by us earlier. However, for increasing T, there are significantdeviations from this model which are probably related to the non-standardbehavior of the upper critical field in the basal plane of UPt{sub 3}.18 refs., 3 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
