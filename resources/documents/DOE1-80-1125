<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-80-1125 </DOCNO><TEXT>Chemical substitution has been used as a probe of the origin of the hightransition temperature in YBa/sub 2/Cu/sub 3/O/sub 7/. The propertiesof this material are best understood when the material is consideredto be a semiconductor doped to metallicity. When oxygen doped, the materialbecomes a 1 dimensional excitonic superconductor. The intrinsic semiconductingenergy gap then provides the mechanism for the extremely high criticaltemperatures observed in this class of materials.</TEXT></DOC>
