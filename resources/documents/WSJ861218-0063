Company sources confirmed plans for the directors' meeting after Scandinavian Airlines System announced a tentative $1.2 billion order for 12 of the aircraft, the successor to the DC-10. The preliminary order, along with an earlier request for nine of the planes from British Caledonian Airways, gives the aircraft maker more than the 20 orders it said it needed before it would commit to production.    But St. Louis-based McDonnell Douglas still hasn't met one other condition it laid down as a requirement for building the plane: obtaining an order from at least one major U.S. carrier. Building the plane without fulfilling that requirement would be taking a chance. That is because McDonnell Douglas would never be able to recover the huge investment required to manufacture the big jet unless the plane caught on in the U.S. market, most analysts believe.    McDonnell Douglas wouldn't confirm plans to hold the special meeting, but company sources said it would take place Dec. 29.    Though top officials of the company have been eager to get the MD-11 off the drawing board and into production, news of any progress on that front has been received with mixed enthusiasm by outsiders. In fact, on several occasions, declines in the company's stock price have been attributed to concern about the large stakes involved in building a jet that will cost more than $80 million each. Analysts believe a safer course for McDonnell Douglas would be to stick to production of its popular two-engine MD-80 jets.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, McDonnell Douglas shares closed at $76.50, down 87.5 cents.    The MD-11 represents the company's only chance to remain a producer of commercial wide-body jets in competition with Seattle-based Boeing Co. A decision to go ahead with the plane also would raise the stakes of entry into the jumbo jet market for Airbus Industrie, the European consortium that has its own wide-body on the drawing board.    A McDonnell Douglas spokesman said the aircraft concern is holding &quot;very active&quot; talks with a number of domestic carriers that are interested in the MD-11, which is expected to have about 300 seats. But the official wouldn't identify the airlines.    At one point, McDonnell Douglas said Delta Air Lines was the leading U.S. candidate to buy the first planes. But Atlanta-based Delta's need for the aircraft has since lessened slightly because of a program it adopted to extend the use of its fleet of L-1011 wide-bodies.    McDonnell Douglas also has received an order for five MD-11s from a Japanese trading company, Mitsui andamp; Co., but that order is viewed as a less important sign of future demand for the plane.    McDonnell Douglas's initial requirements for launching the plane's production don't guarantee that it will be a financial success. The DC-10, for instance, had an encouraging start with large orders from United Airlines, a unit of Chicago-based UAL Inc., and American Airlines, a unit of Dallas-based AMR Corp. Over the long term, however, the company received just less than the 400 orders that it said were required to recoup its investment on the plane.    The MD-11 is a more fuel-efficient version of the DC-10; it would carry more passengers and fly longer distances than its predecessor. McDonnell Douglas said that if the MD-11 is built, the company expects to deliver the first of the planes in 1990. </TEXT></DOC>
