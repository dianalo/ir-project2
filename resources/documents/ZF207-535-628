 Whenpower returns, one command from the keyboard restores users to their formerposition.andM;* [Br pound]300andM;Fast Facts: 300andM;Conner CP 3200andM;* Datafax Systems LtdandM;# (0264) 333224andM;The Conner CP 23200, a 3 1/2-inch hard disk drive, offers 200Mb of 19msstorage for personal computers and workstations.andM;Conner supplies Compaq with disk drives and it's now making that technologyavailable to other users and systems integrators through the UK distributorDatafax.andM;It consumes 3.5W, weighs 2lbs and stands just over one-and-a-half incheshigh,andM;Its size means it's also suitable for use in arrays of disks for high-speedapplications where applications write in parallel across several disks at thesame  time.andM;* Price on applicationandM;Fast Facts: 299andM;Colour MonitorsandM;Hi-Scan PlusandM;* Hitachi Sales (UK)andM;# (01) 848 8787andM;The capabilities of this VGA resolution monitor depend lugely on the graphicsadaptor used.andP;  A standard VGA board gives a resolution of 640x480, but usingthe Sigma VGA/H, for example, resolutions of 1024x768 can be achieved.andM;The Hi-Scan Plus has a 20-inch screen, and is best specified with an extendedVGA adaptor for CAD-type applications, or when you have a Windows-basedenvironment with multiple screen groups and want to see what's going on moreclearly.andM;* [Br pound]2,175andM;Fast Facts: 298andM;Communications HWandM;Exycon 1032 PlusandM;* Exycon LtdandM;# (0582) 402599andM;Multiple communications facilities from a single add-in card is the goal ofthis PC/AT-bus modem card, with a V32 (9600bps) modem, software switchabledown to BT Gold's fastest speed of 1200bps.andM;Exycon claims the design is future-proof because the modem can be configuredand reconfigured at will by loading software into it according to the kind oftask requiredandM;The 1032 also has an IBM-compatible SDLC adaptor, providing support for SNAprotocols such as interactive 3270 and 5250, the LU6.2 network protocol,andM;The modem can be configured to recognize the Hayes command set, and includedin the price is the recaently announced Exycomm/2 comms software, supplied ondisk in both DOS and OS/2 executable forms.andM;*[Br pound] 1,495andM;Fast Facts: 297andM;CoaxControllerandM;* New Leaf SystemsandM;# (0932) 66466andM;This new device, comprising both hardware and software, makes it possible totest IBM 3270 coaxial devices.andM;According to New Led, CoaxController emulates an IBM 3270 control unit,allowing coaxial devices to be tested independently, without the need for anIBM control unit and a mainframe.andM;Two means of testing are possible.andP;  First, by connecting the CoaxControllerto the coaxial device, tests can be selected from a library within thesoftware's menu.andP;  This can test most of the IBM 3270 devices including the3278, 3279, 3287 and the 3270 PC.andM;The second testing method runs between an IBM 3270 coaxial control unit andthe peripheral.andP;  New Led states that aU the transactions between thecontroller and peripheral are time-stamped and stored on disk as an MSDOSfile.andP;  These transactions can then be replayed, edited and output again sothat the CoaxController is driving the peripheral in die same way as thecontroUer was during recording.andP;  This enables any problems to be recreatedand then analysed by users.andM;* [Br pound]2,995 for the output only modelandM;Fast Facts: 296andM;Laser PrintersandM;Genicom 6142andM;* Sintrom ElectronicsandM;# (0734) 311088andM;Sintrom is now offering a 400dpi eight-pagea-minute printer designed byGenicom.andM;According to Sintrom, processing speeds are faster than other laser printersbecause the 6142 uses Genicom's own page description language, Ace.andP;

 Thestandard board comes with 2Mb of memory: additioncts 2Mb modules areavailable at extra cost.andM;*[Br pound]1,695andM;Fast Facts: 293andM;PlottersandM;ImagemakerandM;* Sintrom ElectronicsandM;# (0734) 311088andM;The Imagemaker is specified multi-pen plotter supporting the HP/GL graphicslanguage.andM;Working at 400mm per second, the Imagemaker has a resolution of 0.025mm, anduses eight pens for a variety of media, including clear film and transparentpaper.andP;  The bed sin copes with A4 and oversize A3 plots.andM;Sintrom claims that with its desktop design, Imagemaker provides accuracy andspeed usually only found on floor-standing models, at a significantly lowerprice.andM;*[Br pound]795andM;Fast Facts: 292andM;MP4000 SeriesandM;* Graphtec (UK) LtdandM;# (0270) 625115andM;This range of four plotters starts at [Br pound]745 for the 500mm per secondMP4100, with a resolution of .00625mm, and moves through to the 640mm, persecond MP4400 with a .005mm resolution and a price of [Br pound]1,450including a built-in drive.andP;  The whole range is desktopbased and clearlychallenges the claims from Sintrom to hue the best low-cost plotter around.andM;All models in the range feature serial and paraflel interfaces, and supportboth HP-GL and GP-GL command sets.andP;  The 4100 and 4200 models use steppermotors, but the expensive models use digital-se rvo technology to drive thepens.andM;* [Br pound]745andM;Fast Facts: 291andM;Transputer add- insandM;FIBR5-KandM;* Sension LtdandM;# (0606) 44321andM;The FIBR5-PC, a fibre optic link board for linking connected transputerhosts, aUows networks to be built from PCs up to 500 metres apart.andP;  The boardcontains fibre optic convertors, and takes power from the PC bus.andM;The data, however, doesn't come through the PC bus, but directly downtransputer links into the convertor board and out across the network.andP;  Thecard occupies a half slot in the host machine.andM;This means that wherever there are a number of transputers any user on anymachine can access some, or all, of the total number of transputersavailable.andP;  The FIBR5-PC can also interface a PC to a remote Sension Parallaxarray.andM;* [Br pound],575andM;Fast Facts: 290andM;Wide Area NetworksandM;Retix LANbridge 4880andM;* Retix Systems LtdandM;# (o483) 300600andM;For fast, transparent access to a company network that's miles from your ownsite, Retix offers this interface which connects EtherNet networks and twowide area network links.andM;This bridge aUows two WAN links to another LAN in another location.andP;  It'sprimarily intended for MegaSstream and 1.544 Mbps TI interfaces, but alsosupports several other standards.andM;The company claims the 4880 offers significant transit delay reduction over atraditional X.25 or routing-based solutions, and that it's the only LANbridge which fully utilizes a 2Mbit/s WAN connection.andM;*[Br pound]14,000(including one interface)andM;Fast Facts: 289andM;AccountingandM;Paymaster SERPSandM;* Sapphire InternationalandM;# (01) 554 0582andM;Sapphire International, the licensee of Amstrad Paymaster, hue enhanced diepackage to include employees who have contracted out of the State EarningsRelated Pension Scheme (SERPS).andM;The new feature calculates monthly private pension contributions on middleband earnings and aUows the contributions to be deducted at source.andM;Paymaster costs [Br pound]49, and can handle the payroll, tax and NI of up to999 employees and 99 departments per payroll.andP;
