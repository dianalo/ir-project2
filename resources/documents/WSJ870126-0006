Bain, a Boston consulting firm that advised Guinness on the Distillers bid, declined to comment on the reasons for its decision.    Last week, however, Guinness said it is investigating a payment equivalent to $457,350 made to a company connected to Sir Jack, J. Lyons Chamberlayne andamp; Co. Guinness says the payment was part of $38 million in fees paid to various parties that may have been linked to improper share buying in support of Guinness's bid for Distillers.    Sir Jack said he hasn't been informed by Bain of its decision and doesn't know why he was dismissed. &quot;Why they communicate this to the press and not to me is a mystery,&quot; he said in a statement. A Bain spokesman declined to say whether Sir Jack had been told, saying it is a &quot;private matter.&quot;    The Bain spokesman said Olivier Roux, a Bain consultant who served as a Guinness director and its chief of financial strategy, remains on Bain's payroll. Mr. Roux, who was one of the main figures directing the Distillers bid, has resigned from Guinness's board.    Guinness is the subject of a government investigation to determine whether an illegal stock manipulation helped it succeed in its $3.8 billion bid for Distillers. Guinness has said that Mr. Roux or another Guinness director, Thomas Ward, signed agreements with Bank Leu AG of Switzerland promising the bank that its purchases of Guinness shares would be indemnified against loss by Guinness. Under British law, it is illegal for a company to purchase its own shares without shareholder approval, or to pay others to do so.    Sir Jack, a prominent British businessman, introduced Bain officials to top British business and political figures as part of his role as adviser, according to Bain. Several weeks ago he hosted a lunch at Bain's London office for British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. Sir Jack, 70 years old, is also a member of the advisory board of the Boston-based Bain Capital Fund, a venture-capital fund partly owned by Bain partners.    In his statement, Sir Jack said Bain's actions were &quot;very strange and not the way I would have expected a professional firm to behave, which concerns me as I assisted in their establishment and growth in this country.&quot; A spokesman for Sir Jack declined to comment on whether, or for what purposes, J. Lyons Chamberlayne had received payments from Guinness.    Sir Jack's dismissal marks the latest high-level casualty since the government launched an investigation of Guinness in December. Speculation in the City, London's financial district, is that there will be further resignations this week, possibly at Cazenove andamp; Co. Cazenove handled large Guinness buy orders during the bid for Distillers. </TEXT></DOC>
