Dukakis, during a campaign stop in Cleveland, said he didn'tknow all the facts about Jackson's effort, ``but as a generalmatter private citizens should not try to conduct foreign policy.''   The Democratic nominee said the Reagan administration and theU.N. should handle the hostage issue and said a quick end to thenearly 8-year-old Iran-Iraq war would expedite the release of thehostages.   ``I think they are beginning to make some progress,'' on an endto the war, Dukakis said. ``I think the secretary-general of theU.N. is the person to provide that mediation.''   Democratic vice presidential nominee Lloyd Bentsen, campaigningin Reno, Nev., echoed Dukakis' views, saying, ``I normally undermost conditions like to see officials of the government carryingout any negotiations.   ``I must say Jesse Jackson has ... been very effective at timesin the past in doing some of these things,'' the Texas senatoradded.   Jackson said he issued an appeal through U.N. Secretary-GeneralJavier Perez de Cuellar to impress upon Iranian Foreign MinisterAli Akbar Velayati that the release of the hostages is ``moral andhumanitarian.''   He said he asked de Cuellar ``to appeal to the foreign ministerto hear our humanitarian plea _ to hear our mercy appeal _ and touse his strength to help gain the release of the Americans heldhostage.''   Jackson said ``no meeting has been set, and no meeting has beensought'' for him to negotiate with Iranian officials.   At the United Nations, Iranian Ambassador Mohammad Ja'afarMahallati said the country's foreign minister, Ali Akbar Velayati,will not meet with Jackson to discuss the possible release ofhostages.   Velayati was at the United Nations to discuss ending theIran-Iraq war.   On Tuesday, Iran's parliament speaker, Hashemi Rafsanjani,offered to help get the nine Americans freed if the United Stateswould release Iranian assets frozen since 1979. The Reaganadministration responded that it will make no deals for thehostages' release.   The hostages are believed to be held by Shiite Moslems withlinks to Iran.   Jackson had said he is using several Middle Eastern diplomats asintermediaries in his attempts to negotiate the hostages' release.   In January 1984, Jackson met directly with President Hafez Assadof Syria and arranged the release of Navy Lt. Robert O. GoodmanJr., whose plane was shot down over Lebanon Dec. 4, 1983, during anAmerican air strike against a Syrian anti-aircraft position.</TEXT></DOC>
