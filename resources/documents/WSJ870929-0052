The Detroit-based grocery store chain said that as part of the settlement, it made &quot;substantial&quot; one-time termination payments, which will be reported as the charge. Borman's said it won't know how big the charge is until early October. The company said it expects the terminations &quot;will result in future benefits to the company.&quot;    In the third quarter, ended Nov. 1, 1986, Borman's had operating profit of $784,000, or 28 cents a share. A tax-loss, carry-forward of $1 million, made net income about $1.8 million, or 63 cents a share. Sales were $236.9 million. </TEXT></DOC>
