(graph)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>By Doug ChandlerandM;For companies that require the power offered by relationaldatabase-management software, top-of-the-line packages such as Ashton-Tate'sdBASE IV answer a real need.andM;While these database programs are demanding -- most force users to spendlarge chunks of time on training and require programming to take fulladvantage of their capabilities -- for many organizations the payoff is worthit.andM;Not everyone needs a relational database, however.andP;  Companies that need onlyto keep track of addresses and phone numbers to print out mailing labels, forexample, can get by with a less complex and less expensive flat-file databasemanager.andM;Flat-file packages are easy to use.andP;  Their simplicity often makes them moreuseful than relational databases in tackling complicated data-managementproblems, if users can live with their limitations.andM;While the term ''relational'' may carry an impressive mystique, the maindifference between relational and flat-file databases is simple: Relationaldatabases let users manipulate data from several files at once, whileflat-file databases let users pull data from only one file at a time.andM;Because the data in a single file can be represented in a two-dimensionaltable, one-file-at-a-time packages are commonly called flat-file databases.andO;When Software Publishing Corp., of Mountain View, Calif., introduced in 1980the Personal Filing System, a flat-file product for the Apple II, ''flat-filepackages were treated as not much more than card catalogues,'' said DougLaird, product manager for Professional File, the latest version of thefirm's database program.andP;  ''In the last year and a half, you've seenflat-file packages becoming much more powerful.''andM;Professional File offers users capabilities that were once found only inrelational packages, claimed Laird.andP;  These include the ability to work withseven open files at once and to create custom menu-driven applicationsdesigned for specific tasks.andM;''For example, I do data entry day in and day out, generating reports fromthe same files,'' he said.andP;  ''[With Professional File] you can build a custommenuing system so you don't have to work with other parts of the database.''andO;Users can also put in custom help-screen systems and prompts.andM;Programs such as dBASE IV require that a certain amount of programming bedone to construct custom applications, Laird said.andM;At the Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Ala., Professional File isbeing used to compile a history of the center and a bibliography of documentspertaining to the space-shuttle and space-station programs, said ThomasGates, lead historian for the space-station part of the project.andM;''We will have to go through 9 or 10 million documents for the space shuttleand close to 100,000 documents for the space station,'' said Gates.andO;''Professional File is so simple to use, it's allowed us [historians] tospend our time doing history, not learning a software program.''andM;The program's only drawback is that it doesn't include more editingcapabilities, ''but it's not a word processor,'' Gates said.andM;Many flat-file databases, meanwhile, have begun to offer users more elegantinterfaces, better report-writing capabilities and more customizationoptions, industry observers said.andM;While relational packages make up 70 to 75 percent of the database market,there is still a solid market for flat-file products, and this market willcontinue to exist, according to Alix Ginsburg, director of corporate sales atAlpha Software Corp. in Burlington, Mass.andM;''A lot of people simply can't handle the complexity of relationaldatabases,'' Ginsburg said.andP;  ''Fundamentally, you have to be a programmer,and most businesspeople aren't programmers.''andM;Alpha Software markets the Alpha/ three database package and recentlyintroduced a more complex database called Alpha Four.andM;Alpha/three is a true flat-file package without its own programming language.andO;However, buyers of Alpha/three can get a free copy of Alpha Software'sKeyworks, a keyboard macro program that lets users create their ownapplication menus and automate whatever they do on the keyboard, according toAlpha officials.andM;Alpha/three files are also compatible with dBASE files, making it easy totransfer files in offices that use both database programs, they said.andM;One major airline based at JFK Airport in New York used Alpha/three to set upa personnel database at the airport, but found that sensitive informationsuch as employee reprimands had become too accessible, according to a systemsanalyst for the airline who asked to remain anonymous.andM;The airline plans to move much of its data into a database created with AlphaFour, which will block access to specific types of data that should not beviewed by everyone, the systems analyst said.andM;''Alpha Four is positioned against dBASE [and other relational databases],''said Alpha Software's Ginsburg.andP;  ''It's a fully relational database fornon-programmers.''andM;Along with password protection, Alpha Four will let users design their owncustom menus, she said.andP;  Also, users can set up more sophisticated data-entryrequirements, which might force someone entering data to include, forexample, a Social Security number with each name entered into the database.andM;Another flat-file product that provides compatibility with dBASE isPC-File:dB, from ButtonWare Inc., in Bellevue, Wash.andM;The package reads dBASE files automatically, said Dee Dee Walsh, aspokeswoman at ButtonWare.andP;  Those using dBASE in their offices who want towork at home with dBASE files, therefore, don't have to buy their own copy ofdBASE, she said.andM;''It's an easier alternative to dBASE.andP;  A lot of people use PC-File:dB forits report writer, since you don't have to write a program to write a reportthe way you would have to with dBASE,'' Walsh said.andM;PC-File:dB is based on ButtonWare's PC-File+ flat-file database package.andO;PC-File+ in turn is an updated version of PC-File, one of the first flat-filedatabase managers introduced in 1981, according to Walsh.andM;''With each update [of flat-file database managers], the flat-file andrelational-database categories begin to blur,'' Walsh said.andP;  ''The big guysare realizing they have to make their products easier to use.andP;  On theflat-file end, we realize we have to give our users more power.''andM;Flat-file buyers are looking most of all for database software that isflexible and easy to use, according to Paul Davoust, product manager forReflex, a flat-file database manager from Borland International Inc., inScotts Valley, Calif.andM;''The most common need [for flat-file database users] is to understand thedata they've collected,'' Davoust said.andM;Several PerspectivesandM;Borland's Reflex features the ability to look at data graphically fromseveral different perspectives.andP;  It can also do cross-tabulations, in whichusers can determine, for example, how many salespeople have sold how manywidgets, he said.andM;In addition, Reflex can perform like a spreadsheet, letting users recalculateprices in the price field by 6 percent, for example.andP;  ''If you had a [price]graph open, you would see it upgraded automatically,'' Davoust said.andM;Macon Systems Inc.'s Advanced DB Master flat-file program is one of thefastest on the market, claimed Jerry Macon, president of the ColoradoSprings, Colo., firm.andM;This is because the database manager is able to store data more tightly on adisk than many other programs do, saving disk storage space and data-accessoverhead time, he said.andM;Advanced DB Master's data-exchange module compresses data by storing it invariable-length records, instead of storing it in full-length records inwhich only a few fields hold data, he said.andM;''Databases in general tend to have a lot of empty space in them because moststore fixed-length records,'' Macon said.andM;It also offers some relational capabilities, he said.andP;  For example, users canfill in one or more fields automatically, based on the contents of otherfields.andM;''We stayed with Advanced DB Master because of its speed,'' said DickMcNamara, senior court analyst in the Office of Court Administration for NewYork's state court system, in Rochester, N.Y.andP;  ''We started out with theproduct in the Apple version, then moved to the IBM version.''andM;The package lets users in the court system find a surrogate's record buriedamidst 30,000 cases in about two seconds, using first and last names,McNamara said.andM;Because it is easy to use, the state did not have to bring in programmers orother full-time computer professionals to evaluate the software, he said.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
