Thousands of bundled-up spectators gathered in freezingtemperatures at Daley Plaza downtown for an afternoon rally inhonor of the labor leader and Nobel laureate.   ``I have to apologize for the colds you will get tomorrow,''Walesa told the cheering crowd during his half-hour speech. ``Butyou have to understand; we haven't been able to talk like this for45 years.''   Walesa urged the crowd, which the mayor's office estimated at20,000, to support democratic reform in Poland with dollars as wellas good wishes.   ``We have to change nearly everything in Poland,'' he said. ``Wehave to pass from a totalitarian system to democracy.''   Mietek Goral, who like many at the rally is of Polish descent,said he believed Walesa's visit would convince U.S. enterprises tohelp Poland with investment.   ``The businessmen believe what he tells them,'' Goral said.   Walesa appealed for private investment in is country duringearlier meetings with political, business and union officials, evenwhile stressing that he is at heart a laborer.   ``Thank you brother unionists,'' Walesa told members ofChicago's AFL-CIO at a morning meeting. ``It's due to your unionthat I am here.''   The AFL-CIO provided about $5 million worth of communicationsequipment and other supplies during Solidarity's underground days,dating back to 1981.   Walesa told the union leaders he hoped he would be able to offerU.S. unions similar help some day, and urged laborers to join aunion.   Like a visiting head of state, Walesa was whisked through thecity in a motorcade, with excited crowds waiting to catch a glimpseof him at every stop.   Walesa, often wearing a bemused expression at the enthusiasm ofthe response, worked his way through crowds of admirers, shakinghands and posing for photographs.   He was honored everywhere he went with gifts, including aChicago Bears football helmet. ``My head is too big,'' he said ashe received the helmet.   He also received a membership in Local 134 of the InternationalBrotherhood of Electrical Workers.   ``I'm very happy, but I want to pay my union dues,'' Walesa saidwith a grin as he accepted his membership card and a windbreakerfrom the union.   A union reception of another kind was waiting for Walesa at adowntown hotel where he appeared for a luncheon. Several hundredmembers of the city's police union _ without a contract since Jan.1 _ formed an informational picket. But Walesa was ushered in aside door and did not come into contact with the pickets.   The stop in Chicago, which with 800,000 Polish-Americans boaststhe largest population of Polish descent outside of Warsaw, was thelatest leg of a trip to encourage U.S. financial support forPoland's Solidarity-led coalition government.   At an earlier meeting with officials of the Polish AmericanCongress, Walesa said he is not seeking direct financial aid fromU.S. politicians or businessmen, emphasizing that Poland wants toconcentrate on joint ventures.   ``I appeal to you as teachers, to help us to step onto the rightpath of development,'' Walesa said. ``We want to learn from you howto develop a country, how to move it from a system that failed toone that works.''   Robert A. Bowman, treasurer of Michigan, announced in a morningmeeting in Chicago that his state would purchase $10 million inbonds issued by the Polish government.   Illinois Gov. James R. Thompson said he supported a plan for hisstate to buy $25 million in bonds, but said it first neededlegislative approval.   Walesa made a stop Saturday evening at the Copernicus Center, aPolish cultural center. He praised the efforts of thePolish-American Economic Forum, which was formed this fall toorganize Polish-Americans who want to invest in Poland and toadvise U.S. industry how to do so, said member Marek Stopinski.   After visiting the cultural center, Walesa left forPhiladelphia. He is scheduled to go to South America on Monday.   Since his arrival in the United States last Monday, Walesa hasmet with President Bush, made a speech before a joint session ofCongress, and visited New York.</TEXT></DOC>
