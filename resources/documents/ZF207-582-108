 But to publishing-industryinsiders and observers who have been watching progress made in recent monthsby other developers challenging Adobe with their own PostScript clones,Apple's move was just another step in an already striking trend.andM;In fact, the most remarkable development at the 1989 convention of theAmerican Newspaper Publishers' Association held here in June may have beenthe rise of the PostScript clones.andP;  Clone raster image processors (RIPs)received approval from a number of major hardware vendors and systemintegrators in the newspaper publishing industry, which has the tightestdeadlines and most exacting standards for performance.andM;The RIP is the hardware and/or software that converts, or rasterizes,PostScript code into a fine bit map for output on a laser printer,imagesetter or other output device.andP;  While LaserWriter output is rasterizedon a board inside the printer, RIPs for typesetters are typically separate,specialized machines, although some vendors are now offering software-onlyRIPs that run on the host computer.andM;The Atlas RIP, a hardware/software device supplied by Adobe, is the&quot;official&quot; PostScript RIP, the one supplied by most established leaders inthe typesetting field, including Linotype (with some modifications forspeed), Compugraphic, Varityper (for its 4000 series of typesetters) and nowAutologic.andP;  But during the past several years, other vendors -- notably aNorfolk, England-based company named Hyphen, RIPS (Raster Image ProcessingSystems) of Boulder, Colo., and Tegra/Varityper of East Hanover, N.J.andP;  --andO;have developed their own PostScript RIPs.andM;Until now, these clones have had something of a buccaneering reputation.andO;Sure, they were faster and cheaper, but were they also reliable?andP;  Would theyrun PostScript-intensive programs like QuarkXPress, Aldus FreeHand andAdobe's own Illustrator?andP;  Could they handle Adobe fonts, which have become anindustry standard, or will adequate alternatives be available?andP;  Were thesedevices ready for prime time?andM;Based on evidence from last month's ANPA convention, the newspaper industrynow seems convinced the answer to most of these questions is a clear-cut&quot;yes.&quot;andP;  The Hyphen RIP, demonstrated on systems from no fewer than sixvendors on the show floor, generated the most excitement.andP;  &quot;The price perfunctionality is amazing,&quot; said David Bower, pre-press manager at the MiamiHerald, which uses a Hyphen RIP with an Ultresetter from Ultre Corp. of PortWashington, N.Y., to do ad-sheet inserts in-house.andM;Bower said he had little doubt about the Hyphen RIP's compatibility withother implementations of PostScript.andP;  &quot;The amazing thing was that Hyphen wasso sure of its RIP software that it was printing PostScript files from disksthat people were just bringing unannounced to the booth,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;I wonderif Adobe would do that.&quot;andM;Birmy Graphics Inc., whose BirmySetter uses software supplied by RIPS, andTegra/Varityper, which offers five imagesetters that run off its proprietaryRIP, also had high profiles on the convention floor.andM;Digital Technologies Inc. of Orem, Utah, supplies ad-tracking, makeup andpage-layout software; output devices; and now Macs to hundreds of clients inthe newspaper industry.andP;  DTI also markets Ultre imagesetters that can imagepages up to 72 and 94 picas wide and the 108-pica PelBox 108S Recorder fromECRM of Tewksbury, Mass.andP;  All three are driven by the Hyphen software RIPrunning in a Mac II.andM;&quot;You'd better believe that these machines work,&quot; said DTI salesman RichardWolf.andP;  &quot;If the Detroit News buys one and it doesn't work, we know they canblast us on the front page about it.&quot;andM;DTI is selling the imagesetters and RIP at a price that is remarkable for theindustry.andP;  The 72-pica Ultre system, for example, sells for $25,995,including the 8-Mbyte Mac II on which the RIP resides.andP;  In comparison, aLinotype 200, Linotronic's low-end model, sells for $29,950.andM;Other signs of Hyphen's meteoric success were abundant at the ANPA show.andM;* The company was showing off pages of the London Evening Standard, which hasbeen produced on the UltreSetter with a Hyphen RIP for several months.andM;* A Hyphen RIP and one from Tegra were shown working with the PelBox 3000, anew top-of-the-line, 3,048-dpi recorder from ECRM.andP;  The unit, with pricesstarting at $32,875, promises to be an ideal machine for producing colorseparations.andP;  No Adobe RIP was shown with the ECRM unit.andM;* Hyphen is working on a RIP for the APS-6, Autologic's widely usedtypesetter for the newspaper industry, even though an Adobe RIP was recentlyintroduced on the machine.andM;* Hyphen said that its soon-to-be-released interface for the Linotronic L-300will be significantly faster than Linotype/Adobe's current RIP 3.andM;Meanwhile, Birmy Graphics Inc. of Miami showed off its BirmySetter, whichuses software supplied by RIPS and a new dual-ported hardware RIP (based onRIPS code), allowing users to rasterize two separate jobs at one time.andP;  AndTegra/Varityper introduced an impressive 24-inch (broadsheet-size)plain-paper imagesetter, raising to five the number of devices it offers thatrun from its clone RIP.andM;Some problems, notably in the font area, remain for publishers contemplatingclone RIPs.andP;  Although the RIPS/BirmySetter clone now supports Adobe fonts,Hyphen still does not.andP;  The technical challenge presented by Adobe'sfont-encryption scheme has now been solved, but the English company seems tobe waiting to see whether Adobe finds a way to strike back in the courts.andP;  Inany case, most industry observers said that the selection of typefacesavailable from Bitstream and from other vendors is more than adequate, atleast for newspaper needs.andM;Altogether, the ANPA convention left little doubt that the clones havearrived much faster than expected.andP;  Impressive advantages in price andperformance, and a user base that's already growing rapidly, put the clonesin a good position to take over much of the high-end PostScript market in thenext year.andP;  With Apple about to mount a major challenge at the low end, Adobemust now be groping for a strategy to shore up its position in a market thatonly recently was all its own.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
