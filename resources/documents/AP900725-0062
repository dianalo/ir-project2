(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Federal prosecutors are investigatingallegations that South Carolina's top FBI agent avoided a drunkendriving arrest with the help of the state's chief highwaypatrolman, sources said.   Justice Department officials were expected to arrive here todayto begin the investigation of Fred Verinder, the FBI's specialagent-in-charge for the state, government sources told TheAssociated Press, speaking on condition of anonymity.   Verinder was taken home March 23 rather than to jail by Col.J.H. ``Red'' Lanier, the state highway department's director of lawenforcement, the source said. The FBI agent was stopped north ofColumbia after state trooper John Osborne saw a government carweaving and running off the road, sources said.   Verinder failing a field sobriety test, according to sources whosaw an affidavit from the trooper. The failure included hisinability to recite the alphabet.   The agent then scuffled with Osborne, who handcuffed him and puthim in the patrol car, where Verinder convinced the trooper tophone Lanier, who came to the scene and took him home.   Verinder was cited for alleged speeding, but never was given abreath test for alcohol nor charged with drunken driving.   An official at the FBI's Columbia office who refused to give hisname said he had been told to say Verinder refused to comment onthe incident. The official would not connect a reporter withVerinder.   Lanier denied he did anything wrong, saying the trooper nevertold him Verinder failed the field sobriety test.   ``He had been drinking, (Verinder) told me that, but he wasn'tdrunk,'' Lanier said. ``(Verinder) told me he'd had severaldrinks.''   Lanier denied his actions had anything to do with a federalinvestigation of the highway department, which overseesconstruction as well as law enforcement.   The FBI is one of several agencies investigating allegationsthat highway department employees took money from contractors.   ``That's ridiculous,'' Lanier said. ``He can't control aninvestigation that the State Law Enforcement Division, the IRS andthe FBI, that three agencies are doing.''   Sources said Gov. Carroll Campbell was notified of the incidentabout a month later. The governor told the AP Tuesday night that heordered the case brought to the attention of U.S. Attorney BartDaniel and top state prosecutors.   ``The fact that the statement had been made verbally that thehead of the FBI (in South Carolina) had been assisted by the headof the highway patrol could have compromised the investigation,''Campbell said.   The governor met with Highway Department chief Joseph G.Rideoutte and Highway Commission chairman Charles E. Dalton Tuesdayabout the allegations. Campbell refused to discuss Lanier's future.   Rideoutte said he was investigating the incident, but wasn'tconsidering firing Lanier.</TEXT></DOC>
