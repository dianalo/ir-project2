The company's current seriesof cellular-telephone advertisements bashes what Motorola views as Japan'sunfair trade practices.andM;Now, the Katt has learned, Motorola requires all employees to prove theydon't use illegal drugs.andP;  Motorola computers soon will randomly selectemployees, whose urine will be tested for traces of marijuana, cocaine andother poisons.andP;  If any are found, employees can apply for Motorola'srehabilitation program and continue working.andP;  A second offense costs them thejob.andM;Could Motorola's worst enemies be the ones within?andP;  Ironically, that may besomething the company and Japan Inc. have in common.andP;  Just this week, theKatt's favorite agent in the nation's capital reported that cocaineinterdictions off the Japanese coast are skyrocketing, which has Nippon'spalace guard all abuzz.andP;  A drugs-in-the-workplace problem in Japan, Spenceobserved, could level the high-tech playing field in a hurry.andM;Japan's Nomura bank isn't worried.andP;  It's hard at work ponying up the moneyfor C.Itoh to buy Wang.andP;  Spencer's spies say that Fred Wang lacks his latefather's stamina and sentiment for maintaining the family business and so hasturned East to cash in his chips.andP;  Other Japanese bidders are in the game aswell.andM;Meanwhile, good ol' Uncle Sam is set to reverse himself and will sell 386SXmicroprocessors to the Soviet Union -- because everyone else does.andM;This week's service spot-check: Plus Development's 900 number (five bucks percall, and then the meter starts running).andP;  The Katt's call was answeredwithin 30 seconds, but he wondered, What about all those corporate PBXsystems programmed to prevent workers from calling 900 numbers?andP;  No wonderPlus answered so quickly.andM;This week's naughty vendor: Quarterdeck, which received low marks from aCompuServe scribe who wrote of interminable busy signals on the phone, then adesperate E-mail exchange in which the Q-deck rookie thought TCP/IP was&quot;something new from Sun.&quot;andM;LAN ScandalsandM;Purely professional was the gala rollout of Windows 3.0.andP;  Spencer just can'tbelieve Microsoft used Novell's NetWare 386, not its own LAN Manager, to linkthose 50 PCs running Windows 3.0 demos.andM;Nobody's perfect, averred Spencer.andP;  Novell has picked the worst possible timeto beat up its dealers.andM;The company has apparently asked its dealers for lists of their top accounts,its purpose being to sell assorted NetWare products direct, cutting thedealers out.andP;  All this, noted the Wise One, while Microsoft's LAN Man team iswooing every NetWare VAR who can lift a screwdriver.andM;Novell's NetWire bulletin board was choked last week with callers attemptingto download workstation software that supports Windows 3.0.andP;  So thick was thetraffic that users were getting &quot;too many simultaneous users&quot; messages onCompuServe, whose bandwidth is generally quite adequate.andM;Is Jean-Louis Gassee really going to Oracle?andP;  Will Larry Ellison trust a manwho wears an earring?andP;  What's this about the AS/400 running OS/2 PMapplications?andP;  Will Philips and Olivetti really merge?andP;  Does Microsoft reallyhave its own object-oriented version of NewWave running in its labs?andM;What say you?andP;  Your hottest news tip is worth a snow-white Spencer gym bagwith a call to (617) 375-4000; or an electronic missive to the Katt's MCIbox, SKATT; or to his overflowing CompuServe address, 72631,107.andM;Spencer warmly thanks his loyal legions for their generous contributions tothe walk for AIDS research, set for Sunday, June 3, in Boston.andP;  Pledges ofany size should be sent to Sponsor Spencer, c/o PC Week, 800 Boylston St.,andO;Boston, Mass.andP;  02199.. .andP;  .
