The investment partnership Forstmann Little andamp; Co. offeredWednesday to acquire AFG for more than $33 cash a share, althoughit conditioned the size of the premium on its ability to meet withmanagement and to review internal corporate information.   AFG announced Feb. 25 that it had agreed to a two-step buyoutvalued at $33 a share by a new company by a new company headed byAFG founder and chairman, R.D. Hubbard.   That offer would pay $33 cash a share for 94 percent of AFG'sstock and $33 per share in preferred stock or a combination of cashand stock, for the rest of the shares. Based on AFG's 28.5 millioncommon shares outstanding, the offer had an indicated value of$940.5 million.   AFG rose 12{ cents to $32.25 a share Wednesday on the New YorkStock Exchange. The new offer was announced hours after the marketclosed.   Forstmann Little, which specializes in leveraged buyouts, statedits offer was not conditioned on financing commitments beingobtained. It indicated its decision on the final size of its buyoutoffer depended on ``prompt receipt and evaluation of informationregarding the company'' and on an opportunity to meet with AFGmanagement.   The firm stated it was capitalized at about $2.7 billion, with$2.4 billion of that available for future acquisitions.   Irvine, Calif.-based AFG, one of North America's leading makersof flat glass, declined through a spokesman to comment on theproposal.   Forstmann Little is in the process of acquiring Stanadyne Corp.,a major manufacturer of plumbing fixtures and diesel fuel injectionsystems, in an $820 million leveraged buyout.   In a leveraged buyout, a company is acquired mainly withborrowed funds that are repaid with the target company's cash flowor by the sale of its assets.   The firm also has led buyouts of Lear Siegler Inc., Dr PepperCo., Sybron Corp. and Topps Co. Inc. in recent years.   Analysts widely had expected competing offers to emerge for AFG,deeming the Hubbard bid as relatively low.   Hubbard's offer was made by Clarity Holdings Corp., a newlyformed company headed by Hubbard.   AFG became well recognized outside its own industry in 1986 whenit launched an unsuccessful hostile takeover bid for Lear Siegler,the aerospace and manufacturing conglomerate based in Santa Monica,Calif.   In 1987, AFG made an unsucessful hostile bid for Gencorp. ofAkron, Ohio, which formerly was known as General Tire andamp; Rubber Co.   Late last year, AFG announced it had agreed to purchase FordMotor Co.'s glass-making operations in Canada, which with annualsales of about $150 million was the industry leader in thatcountry. No terms were disclosed for that deal, which closed earlythis year.</TEXT></DOC>
