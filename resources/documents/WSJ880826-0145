He asked to see the evidence on which Mr. Husseini has been condemned to six months in prison.    Mr. Husseini, an academic who heads the Arab Studies Center, a Jerusalem think tank, is one of hundreds of Palestinians being held under &quot;administrative detention,&quot; a provision of Israeli security law that allows imprisonment without charge. But to the U.S. government and to many Israelis, Mr. Husseini's detention is particularly egregious, for he is the most popular and influential Palestinian leader on the West Bank yet to dare reach for peace.    &quot;It seems the government is much more harsh with Palestinians who are ready to negotiate,&quot; says Mr. Feldman, an Israeli. &quot;They are determined to establish their statement that there isn't anyone to talk to on the Palestinian side.&quot; Mr. Husseini calls for a Palestinian state living in peace beside Israel.    Mr. Husseini's importance, says a U.S. official who has met him, is twofold: He has never been linked with any terrorist act, and he has a following among Palestinians that reaches from the intellectual elite to hot-headed youths rioting in refugee camps. He is respected in a way that other moderate Palestinians aren't.    Part of his prestige is inherited from his father, Abdel Kader el-Husseini, a charismatic military commander whose death in 1948 at the battle of Castel in the first Arab-Israeli war paved the way for the collapse of the Arab forces there.    The Israeli government says the 48-year-old Mr. Husseini is the most senior operative of the Palestine Liberation Organization in the occupied territories. Citing security constraints, it declines to elaborate on this claim or offer any evidence. Mr. Husseini says his activities are entirely independent, though he urges Israeli-PLO negotiations.    His latest arrest, on July 30, came just three days after he had addressed a meeting of Israel's Peace Now organization. At that meeting he called for Palestinians and Israelis to recognize that both had dreams: Some Palestinians, he said, dreamed of reclaiming lost lands in Israel, while some Israelis dreamed of forever dominating all the West Bank. Both sides, he said, have to put those dreams aside to create a peaceful reality for both peoples.    The U.S. government has vigorously protested his arrest publicly and privately, but without result. About 2,000 Israelis also protested, holding a demonstration outside the home of Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin with banners saying, &quot;Don't arrest them, talk to them.&quot;    Mr. Rabin says he has been talking to Palestinians, in a series of private meetings in recent weeks. But he isn't interested, he says, in dealing with &quot;mailmen to Tunisia,&quot; the PLO headquarters.    &quot;Rabin has been having monologues so he can tell Americans he's talking to Palestinians,&quot; says Sa'eb Erakat, a Palestinian professor of political science who has spoken with some of the personalities who have met with the defense minister. He says the arrest of Mr. Husseini shows that the government is determined to stifle any real dialogue. &quot;Why is it that any time Faisal makes contact with Israelis he goes to jail?&quot; Mr. Erakat asks.    Mr. Husseini has spent most of the past 18 months in jail. Before that, he lived under town arrest in Jerusalem, forbidden to be outside his home between sunset and dawn or to leave the city at any time. He has only been formally charged once -- 21 years ago, when he was convicted of having a gun in his house.    Since then, arrests have generally followed publicized meetings with Israelis. Last year he met Moshe Amirav, a member of the hard-line Likud bloc, and discussions included the possibility of opening a channel of communication between Likud and PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat. When news of the meetings leaked, outraged Likud stalwarts expelled Mr. Amirav, and Mr. Husseini wound up in jail.    In 1986, he met Natan Sharansky, the prominent campaigner for the rights of Soviet Jews. They discussed the deportation of Akram Haniye, a Palestinian newspaper editor. Later, Mr. Sharansky said he hadn't known of Mr. Husseini's alleged PLO links and regretted the meeting. Mr. Husseini responded by describing Mr. Sharansky as &quot;a great man suddenly turned small.&quot;    Mr. Husseini was in jail when the uprising broke out in December. He was free for less than two months before his latest arrest. One Israeli who met with him during that time says they were working together on a series of Israeli and Palestinian workshops to grapple with issues, such as water rights, that the two societies would face after peace is achieved.    About 15 plainclothes police staged a 2 a.m. raid on Mr. Husseini's East Jerusalem home. They searched the house, going through everything from personal letters to the school report cards of his two children. The document that most interested them was a draft discussion paper on a Palestinian declaration of independence.    &quot;The government says this is a PLO document,&quot; says Mr. Feldman, Mr. Husseini's lawyer. &quot;Yet even the court has said these aren't PLO positions.&quot; (The document calls for recognition of Israel within the 1947 borders as a starting point for negotiations. Officially, the PLO's charter still calls Israel illegitimate within any borders. The document closely follows a similar proposal in the New York Times by Jerome Segal, an American Jewish academic from the University of Maryland.)    Mr. Husseini's case now will go to the Supreme Court for a decision on whether evidence against him should be made available. &quot;If he is a PLO officer,&quot; says Mr. Feldman, &quot;then the PLO has changed substantially.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
