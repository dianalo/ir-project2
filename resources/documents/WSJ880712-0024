Brian Loton, chief executive officer, says the Melbourne-based company is stronger and more focused than in past years, when it suffered serial raids by Robert Holmes a Court. &quot;You won't see a repeat of the circumstances that attracted Mr. Holmes a Court,&quot; he says.    Mr. Loton and other BHP executives breakfasted yesterday with Wall Street Journal reporters at New York's Pierre hotel. Later, the executives addressed the New York Society of Security Analysts.    The message: BHP isn't just Australia's biggest company but also is an international resource giant with growing U.S. interests. Mr. Loton drew attention to BHP's burgeoning energy and minerals business and its recovering steel business, as well as its new look, with fresh board members and a new management team. Despite distractions from raiders, &quot;The company has got on with its business,&quot; he says.    Mr. Loton's goal is to attract more U.S. investors to BHP shares. They trade on the Big Board in the form of American depositary receipts and finished at 26 3/4 yesterday, up 3/8.    For U.S. investors, though, says one New York money manager, BHP stock remains &quot;a call on the Australian economy&quot; and its currency. Some investors aren't making that call. Australia's dollar already has rallied and BHP shares appear fairly valued, they say. Moreover, oil prices are weak and &quot;it's too early&quot; to make big bets on inflation plays like gold, says one investor. The company's ADRs are thinly traded, he adds, making it hard for most Americans to buy and sell BHP in size.    But Peter Wade, an analyst in the New York office of Australian broker J.B. Were andamp; Son, thinks BHP is headed higher. Australian pension funds should be buying more of the stock, he says; new tax rules have made big-dividend payers like BHP more attractive. Although predicting relatively flat profit for BHP in the fiscal year ending May 31, 1989, because of lower investment income, he sees a big gain to about 86 Australian cents a share in fiscal 1990. Mr. Wade also thinks the recent &quot;selling pressure&quot; on BHP may be over.    Mr. Holmes a Court, who was badly hurt in the stock market crash, is believed to have been unloading BHP shares in recent weeks. Earlier this year, the company bought back 300 million shares from the investor, leaving him about a 12% stake. Sources say his stake now is only 5% to 6%. And some people think this remaining stake, instead of being dumped on the market and depressing the stock price, soon will show up &quot;in friendly hands&quot; -- that is, friendly to BHP. The company says it hasn't any knowledge of such an arrangement.    At the breakfast yesterday, Mr. Loton laughed heartily when asked whether Mr. Holmes a Court's financial troubles, which may have encouraged him to sell stock back to BHP, were a relief to company executives. &quot;No,&quot; he replied. &quot;We say it was a negotiated settlement.&quot; Simultaneously with that agreement, BHP effectively locked up another 300 million shares owned by Elders IXL, an Australian brewing and food company with which it has a cross-ownership arrangement.    BHP has repaid some debt taken on for its big stock buy-backs, with asset sales of about $2.5 billion. Its debt-to-equity ratio has fallen to 51% and &quot;the goal is 40% to 45%,&quot; Mr. Loton says. BHP will continue to trade properties but isn't seeking big acquisitions, he adds.    Much sooner than other asset-rich behemoths like USX Corp. and Texaco, BHP was forced by tough economic conditions and raider pressure to revamp operations. It slashed steel capacity and labor, and modernized mills. And it aggressively built its oil business.    In the future, Mr. Loton says, BHP's steel unit -- which was &quot;in crisis&quot; in 1983 -- should be a significant generator of cash flow and profit. The minerals business, including copper and gold, has started contributing to cash flow. And the oil business, although absorbing cash for exploration, is adding low-cost reserves. While some U.S. oil companies aren't fully replacing reserves, Peter Wilcox, head of BHP Petroleum, says the unit last year replaced 173% of its reserves, yet division profit rose 26%.    One concern, says First Boston analyst William Randol: BHP's Australian Bass Strait oil output is declining and it may be &quot;hard pressed&quot; to offset that. But BHP has high hopes for its Timor Sea exploration off Australia's northern coast, where four rigs will be operating by August. &quot;And we're looking world-wide for low-cost reserves,&quot; Mr. Loton says.    ---   Broken Hill Proprietary   (NYSE; Symbol: BHP)   Business: Resources, steel   Year Ended May 31, 1988:*   Sales: $10.86 billion   Net income: $985 million; 63 cents a share**   Fourth quarter, May 31, 1988:*   Per-share earnings: 19 cents vs. 14 cents****   Average daily trading volume:   15,177 Americann Depositary Receipts**   Common Shares outstanidng: 1.55 billion**   *In Australian dollars; One U.S. $ = 80.33 cents as of May 31.    **Four ADRs = one common share   ***Assumes buy-back of 300 million shares   ****Four ADRs = one common share; assumes buy-back of 300 million shares   Note: Not traded on July 5</TEXT></DOC>
