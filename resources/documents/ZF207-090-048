Van NameandM;and Bill CatchingsandM;The following peripheral-sharing hardware and software provide many basicfeatures of local area networks (LANs), without requiring a LAN card in eachPC.andM;These zero-slot LANs, or sub-LANs, use the standard serial port of eachconnected PC to allow the PCs to communicate.andP;  Their software typically runsas a terminate-and-stay-resident (TSR) program that users can summon with ahot key.andM;These products let users share peripherals, such as printers and modems, andtransfer files between machines.andP;  They also support some type of filesharing, ranging from the simple (allowing multiple users to view a filesimultaneously) to the more complex (making a remote machine's disk appear asa local virtual disk).andM;ACTLink Systemizer PlusandM;Applied Creative TechnologyandM;Users can construct an ACT sub-LAN by using a combination of the SystemizerPlus hardware switch and ACTLink software with each PC on the network.andP;  EachPC connects to a Systemizer Plus, and cables between the Systemizer Plusboxes on those PCs link the PCs.andP;  Each network can link up to 31 PCs.andM;The $399 Systemizer Plus comes with a 64K-byte buffer, which can be expandedto 1M byte.andP;  The device lets the user choose from up to eight attachedperipherals.andM;ACTLink software, which comes free with every Systemizer Plus, lets usersaccess files on a remote PC's disk.andP;  Only remote users with the correctpassword can manipulate their files.andM;Applied Creative Technology Inc. is located at 8333 Douglas Ave., Suite 700,Dallas, Texas 75225 (214) 739-2400 or (800) 433-5373.andM;According to users .andP;  .  .andM;''We chose this because it was less expensive [than a LAN], and it includesabout 90 percent of the capabilities of a LAN,'' said Tech.andP;  Sgt.andP;  JohnMcCarty of the 341st Security Police Group of the U.S.andP;  Air Force atMalmstrom Air Force Base in Montana.andP;  ''We use it for everything from mail tofile sharing to printer sharing.andP;  There wasn't a single thing we could findto fault the system.''andM;McCarty said that a speed-up utility made file transfer and file sharingperform reasonably.andP;  ''If you go at the standard 9,600-baud speed, we weredissatisfied.andP;  However, when we used the utility program that comes with itthat speeds up the serial port, we timed the speed at 76,800 baud, aneightfold increase.''andM;Overall, he said, ''It is a definite viable alternative to a LAN for a smallbusiness with eight or nine PCs.''andM;ZeroNetandM;Applied Knowledge Groups Inc.andM;The $598 ZeroNet starter kit includes everything necessary to link two PCs:software, two converters that attach to a serial port and can accept twostandard RJ-11 connectors, and a 14-foot, standard RJ-11 cable.andP;  The softwareand converter for additional PCs cost $299 per unit, up to a maximum of 10PCs with only software, or 30 PCs with an optional connecting box.andM;ZeroNet can work over any network topology, including a ring or star, thatlinks all of the PCs.andP;  Its throughput is about 90,000 bits per second (bps)over the maximum 115,200-bps rate of the serial port.andM;ZeroNet software is NetBIOS compatible, with full file- and record-lockingcommands.andP;  It lets users see remote disks as local virtual disks, and letsthem use normal DOS commands to manipulate files on those disks.andM;The package also comes with a modem program, AutoCom, which allows users totransfer and share files over a modem.andM;Applied Knowledge Groups Inc. is located at 33 Music Square West, Suite102-B, Nashville, Tenn.andP;  37203 (615) 244-2828 or (800) 443-1254.andM;According to users .andP;  .  .andM;''We felt it was important to have a product that supported a standardnetwork environment,'' said Vince Carlson, president of Carlisle Systems, anOEM in Burlington, Mass.andP;  ''When you are running their NetBIOS, the ZeroNetpackage is transparent to network applications.''andM;Another ZeroNet user, Scott Sage, president of voice-mail vendor CirrusTechnologies in Atlanta, said he had good luck with ZeroNet's file-sharingfeatures.andP;  Sage said that ZeroNet's price made it an attractive option forbuyers who need relatively small networks.andP;  ''[ZeroNet] is more geared towardallowing an entire office to communicate, whether it be messages or smallfiles, without investing in a multithousand-dollar system.''andM;Data Connectivity (DC-1)andM;NetCommanderandM;Digital Products Inc.andM;Digital Products allows users to build networks with a combination of itsNetCommander hardware switch and Data Connectivity (DC-1) file-sharingsoftware.andP;  The NetCommander switch has an on-board Z-80 processor that cansupport serial transfers from 300 to 115,000 bps.andP;  It comes in versions thatsupport from 10 to 32 attached PCs or serial devices.andM;The DC-1 software is NetBIOS compatible and lets two PCs share files withfull file- and record-locking controls.andP;  A single external user can access aremote PC's files at any time.andM;Digital Products offers bundled SubLAN packages of the NetCommander and DC-1products ranging from $4,395 for a 10-port version to $10,995 for a 32-portversion.andP;  Buyers can also purchase the DC-1 software separately for $150 perPC, and site licenses for the NetCommander switches are also available.andM;Digital Products Inc. is located at 108 Water St., Watertown, Mass.andP;  02172(617) 924-1680 or (800) 243-2333.andM;According to users .andP;  .  .andM;Jon Earl, a consultant with Grosse Pointe Data Services, a consulting firm inGrosse Pointe, Mich., uses DC-1 and the NetCommander in a network he set upfor a major bank in the Detroit area.andP;  The bank ''had a department that isgrowing in leaps and bounds,'' Earl said.andP;  ''They did not want to invest inthe trouble of a LAN, and they did not want a LAN administrator.andP;  The conceptof the sub-LAN made sense.''andM;The Credit Exposure Management Systems department of the Chemical Bank in NewYork is also working with a sub-LAN from Digital Products.andP;  Lee Bowman, asystems analyst, is using it to let developers on PCs communicate about largeprojects.andP;  ''Our department is piloting a project to take our development offthe mainframe and down to the PC level,'' said Bowman.andP;  ''To do that, we'regoing to use NetCommander to set up a PC-level library that everyone canuse.''andM;''The only problem I've had [so far],'' he said, ''is that the software thatlets you choose the printer takes up a lot of memory.andP;  Sometimes we've had toswap it out to run some of our applications.''andM;ManyLink for PCsandM;ManyLink for Work GroupsandM;NetLine Inc.andM;ManyLink for PCs and ManyLink for Work Groups are two versions of the samesoftware.andP;  The $165 ManyLink for PCs comes with a cable that can connect twoPCs.andP;  Two PCs can be added by buying additional cables and software, up to amaximum of eight PCs.andP;  ManyLink for Work Groups costs $495 for a license touse the software with from three to eight PCs, but does not include anycabling.andM;Users can choose the network topology they want, as long as all the PCs canbe reached from each PC.andP;  The connections run at 9,600 bps on PCs and XTs,and at 19,200 bps on ATs and '386-based systems.andM;The ManyLink software supports file transfer and will allow several users toview a file simultaneously.andP;  It also includes a Chat messaging system thatlets users send messages between connected PCs.andM;NetLine Inc. is located at 2155 North 200 West, Suite 90, Provo, Utah 84604(801) 373-6000 or (801) 375-9866.andM;According to users .andP;  .  .andM;Brian Pendleton, an assistant script coordinator for TV producer Ten-FourProductions in Los Angeles, uses ManyLink for Work Groups to link the threewriters for ''The War of the Worlds'' television show.andP;  ''We use it totransfer scripts from [the writers'] computers to a main computer,'' saidPendleton.andP;  ''The writers use the Chat program to communicate.''andM;Edgerton recommends the package highly.andP;  ''If you're looking for somethingthat doesn't cost as much as a network, but accomplishes the majority ofthings people want to do -- share peripherals and transfer files -- this isthe product to buy.''andM;MasterNet/MasterSwitchandM;Rose ElectronicsandM;The MasterSwitch hardware switch sits at the center of a star of PCs, each ofwhich is linked to it via standard serial connections.andP;  Each PC must also runthe MasterNet software to be able to share and transfer files.andM;MasterSwitch hardware comes in models with from two to nine ports, which canconsist of any combination of serial and parallel ports.andP;  The device rangesin price from $295 for the basic two-port version to $849 for the standardnine-port configuration.andP;  It can handle connections from 50 bps to 19,200bps.andM;MasterNet software is an approximately 55K-byte memory-resident program thatusers can purchase for $99 per PC.andP;  It lets several users type a filesimultaneously and can also perform file operations such as copy, rename anddelete on remote files.andP;  Users can protect their files and directories fromremote accesses.andM;Rose Electronics can be reached at P.O.andP;  Box 742571, Houston, Texas 77274(713) 933-7673.andM;According to users .andP;  .  .andM;Rich Jacobs, a senior financial analyst for the Dresser Valve and ControlDivision of Dresser Industries, an oil-equipment company in The Woodlands,Texas, said the combination of MasterNet and MasterSwitch has worked well asa way to let his department transfer files and share peripherals.andP;  ''This isa simple solution that works very well for us.''andM;Unlike many sub-LAN users who are often attracted to these products by theirrelatively low price, Jacobs chose MasterNet not because of the cost savings,he said, but because ''it was the right answer.''andM;''We looked at full-blown LANs,'' Jacobs said, ''but they did not serve us aswell.''andM;EasyLANandM;Server TechnologyandM;The EasyLAN software lets users build a network of up to 18 PCs in a starthat centers around a hub PC.andM;Because all of the connections between the outlying PCs and the hub usestandard serial ports, the hub PC needs additional ports.andP;  To solve thisproblem, Server Technology sells two- and six-port EasyCOM serial cards for$219.95 and $489.95, respectively.andM;The PCs connect with standard RJ-11 telephone cable that can support speedsup to 56,000 bps.andP;  With the EasyLAN software, multiple users can type a filesimultaneously, and can also transfer files and share peripherals.andM;A two-PC EasyLAN kit, which includes the software, adapters and cable, costs$219.95.andP;  The software alone costs $99.95 for each PC.andM;Server Technology is located at 140 Kifer Court, Suite A, Sunnyvale, Calif.andO;94086 (408) 738-8377.andM;According to users .andP;  .  .andM;''This is a great way to copy little files back and forth, and to be able touse your printers nicely,'' said John Haestad, president of hydrology forhydraulic-software vendor Haestad Methods in Waterbury, Conn.andM;The speed limitations of the serial port can be a problem, Haley said, addingthat it is adequate for most of his needs.andP;  ''It's acceptable if you're goingto be transferring small files,'' he said.andM;Steve Solomon, a senior software engineer with pharmaceutical vendor Glycomedin Alameda, Calif., uses EasyLAN in conjunction with a Novell Inc.andP;  LAN.andP;  ''Iuse EasyLAN to be able to sit in my office and help [the other users] withouthaving to go in and check what's happening on their PCs,'' he said.andM;Like Haestad, Solomon was particularly pleased with the low memory cost ofEasyLAN.andP;  ''For my needs,'' he said, ''this was the best compromise betweencapabilities and memory trade-offs.''andM;LANLink 5XandM;The Software Link (TSL)andM;LANLink 5X is a software-only sub-LAN designed around a star topology, with aserver in the center and up to 16 attached satellite PCs.andP;  It is alsopossible to configure any PC as both a server and a satellite, for two-waysharing.andM;The server must run a $275 server version of LANLink, and that softwarerequires a special multitasking environment.andP;  That environment can be eitherTSL's PC-MOS operating system or its DOS MultiLink MultiTasking Only package,both of which cost $195.andM;Each satellite PC must run a $125 version of LANLink 5X.andM;LANLink 5X is also available in a version that uses the PC's parallel port,as long as that port can support bidirectional communication.andP;  The parallelversion can run at speeds up to 524,288 bps, almost five times the maximum115K-bps rate of the serial connection.andM;The LANLink 5X software lets users view the server's disk as a local virtualdisk, with full read-write access.andP;  It works completely with the file- andrecord-locking features of the DOS 3.3 or higher SHARE command.andM;The Software Link is located at 3577 Parkway Lane, Norcross, Ga.andP;  30092 (404)448-5465 or (800) 451-5465.andM;According to users .andP;  .  .andM;''It works fine for us,'' said Laura Hinze, vice president of operations forConversational Voice Technologies Corp., a telemarketing firm in Gurnee, Ill.andO;''With what we're trying to accomplish, we don't have speed problems.''andM;Although Hinze said she is very satisfied overall with LANLink 5X, she isunhappy with TSL's support and documentation.andP;  ''The manual that is sent withthe product is one of the worst manuals that I've ever seen,'' she explained.andO;''If our technicians did not have a grounding in cabling and using PCs, itwould not be a customer-installed LAN.''andM;June Woodward, assistant director for systems development and technicalservices, a division of the Department of Planning and Economic Developmentfor Fulton County government in Atlanta, recommended the product as analternative for those who don't need the full power -- and price -- of a LAN.andM;''Basically, it's a reasonably low-level, easy, entry-level network thatworks very well,'' Woodward said.andP;  ''It's considerably simpler and requiresconsiderably less administration than the network heavy-hitters.''andM;WTI/EasyLAN INC-64andM;Intelligent Network ControllerandM;Western Telematic Inc.andM;Western Telematic's INC-64 is a hardware switch that sits in the center of astar of PCs.andP;  The PCs connect to the INC-64 through normal RS-232 cables.andM;The INC-64 comes in a $2,115 base configuration, which includes eight serialports and a 32K-byte buffer for each port.andP;  Users can add additionaleight-port cards for $725 each, up to a maximum of 64 ports.andM;INC-64 lets users share printers and other peripherals.andP;  To be able to sharefiles, the PCs must run Western Telematic's WTI/EasyLAN software, which costs$100 per PC.andP;  WTI/EasyLAN software is a version of Server Technology'sEasyLAN software, which is customized to work with the INC-64 hardwareswitch.andM;Western Telematic Inc. is located at 5 Sterling, Irvine, Calif.andP;  92718 (714)586-9950 or (800) 854-7226.andP;  Because the firm has just begun to shipWTI/EasyLAN, there are currently no product users.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
