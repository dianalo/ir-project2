 Gray-scales are needed for handling images withshading or color, and scanners are now capable of working withgray-scales which vary in value from four shades to 256 shades.andO;Some scanners have been specialized to capture video images.andO;Prices of scanners generally fall in the $1,500 to $4,000 range.andO;The price rises with the number of shades of gray the deviceoffers and the image definition it produces.andP;  These factors alsoinfluence how long it takes to scan and process an image.andP;  Lineart work can be managed by most scanners, 16-level scanners areadequate for positioning and sizing an image but not much more,64-level scanners are practical for a paper laser printer, and256-level devices are best for phototypesetters.andP;

 Thatcapability can be extremely attractive for designers, managers or anyone whowants to avoid having to duplicate work.andM;But choosing the right scanner can be confusing, and it is all too easy topay for more than you need.andP;  A properly tailored purchase will take intoconsideration the type of documents being scanned as well as the necessaryresolution, scanning speed and software.andM;For gray-scale scanners, for example, options range from four shades of graythrough 64 shades and up to 256.andP;  Then there are the issues of deciding theoptimum resolution, performance and software to fit your needs and budget.andO;And users opting for increased capabilities need to recognize a correlatingincrease in memory requirements, time and cost.andM;Shades of gray.andP;  The first scanners were judgmental devices, thinking only interms of black and white.andP;  Each spot on the page was one or the other.andP;  If itwas actually somewhere in between, the scanner and its software rounded itoff to one of the extremes.andM;This two-shade, one-bit style of scanning makes for compact image files andfast scans, and it works decently for preview scans or even for final scansof crisp line art.andP;  But it doesn't work particularly well with shaded orcolored images.andP;  Such details as highlights, shading and lighting in theoriginal image will be missing from the stored file.andM;Intelligent scanners can work with a more flexible scale of values.andP;  Thestate of the art in gray-scale scanning has grown from four shades (two bitsper pixel) to 16 (four bits), 64 (six bits) and now to 256 (eight bits perpixel).andM;The Apple Scanner is a 16-shade device, as is Hewlett-Packard's ScanJet Plusand the latest models from Microtek, Thunderware Inc. and Xerox ImagingSystems Inc.andP;  In addition, specialized scanners called video digitizers cancapture images from videotape or use a video camera as their optics.andP;  KoalaTechnologies' MacVision, for instance, can scan at 256 shades of gray at aresolution of 640 by 480 pixels.andP;  The Barneyscan Slide Scanner can scanphotographic color slides and convert them to black-and-white slides ornegatives at a minimum of 1,000 dpi.andM;Increased gray-scale ability leads to higher scanner prices and longerscanning and processing times, as well as larger files.andP;  A 256-shade file canoften reach 4 to 5 Mbytes.andP;  Still, it's better to capture more information atthe outset than pining for it later.andP;  But while people have a tendency to&quot;need&quot; 256 shades of gray just because it's the latest thing, not every jobrequires such subtlety.andM;This gray's for you.andP;  At Image Express in Orange, Calif., Glenn Cruzendivides graphics scannir tasks into four types.andP;  First is the line-art work,which most scanners handle.andP;  Then comes 16-level shaded images.andP;  &quot;The bestyou could ever call these is 'for position-only,' showing how a picturecrops, how big it is and whether it is upside down -- which sounds like ajoke until it happens.&quot;andP;  At 16 levels, the files are small and the quality&quot;real low,&quot; according to Cruzen.andM;Next come images with 64 shades of gray.andP;  For Cruzen, this &quot;exceeds thequantity of gray levels on paper laser printers, but not by a lot.&quot;andP;  He saidthat he sees 64-level scanners as practical for &quot;guys who turn out catalogson newsprint, who in the past had to have a Velox shot of pictures.&quot;andM;But, said Cruzen, &quot;if somebody wants to use 133- to 150-line screens inprinting on a Linotronic or other phototypesetter, you need 256 levels [ofgray].&quot;andM;Fortunately for users who need high-end machines, the price curve for moreshades of gray isn't overly steep.andP;  For example, Microtek's one-bit scannerlists for $1,600, the six-bit (64 shades) scanner costs $1,750, and its256-shade scanner is $2,195.andP;  DEST's 16-shade scanner lists for $1,750, whilethe 256-level scanner carries a $2,250 tag.andP;  (These were the prices beforeDEST filed for protection under Chapter 11.andM;Resolution is an issue.andP;  A scanner bounces light off a page to see andremember where the light and dark areas are.andP;  The more spots it looks at, themore RAM and disk space you'll need to store the information and the moretime it will take to process it.andP;  Still, if it doesn't cost too dearly intime and memory, you may be better off capturing more information thansettling for less.andP;  Anything extra can always be trimmed or compacted, butmissing information can only be guessed at.andM;Today, 300 dpi is the standard resolution for desktop scanners.andP;  Someportable scanners scan at 200 dpi while some recent (and more expensive)desktop scanners can handle 400 or even 1,500 dpi.andP;  Keep in mind that a400-dpi scanner doesn't just up the resolution 33 percent.andP;  It actuallyprovides 160,000 dots per square inch, compared with 90,000 for the 300-dpiscanner.andP;  That's nearly twice as many points of information.andM;Improved resolution can be expensive.andP;  Microtek, for example, charges nearlytwice as much ($3,995) for its 400-dpi scanner as for its comparable 300-dpiscanner ($2,195).andM;When looking at a high-resolution machine, it's important to know how theclaimed resolution is achieved.andP;  Some scanners actually inspect the scannedpage at the stated resolution.andP;  Other scanners optically scan at 300 dpi,then electronically interpolate other values in between.andP;  This second methoddoes not guarantee as much concrete information as the true, opticalhigh-resolution scan.andM;Higher resolution scans are certainly useful when capturing sophisticatedimages such as photographs.andP;  They can also help when recognizing text byoffering more detailed images of characters and when scanning line art byoffering smoother-edged images.andM;It's important to remember that if you plan to scan and then enlarge anyimage, you'll be decreasing its final effective resolution.andP;  Scan at 300 dpi,enlarge by a factor of four and print on a laser printer, and you may wellsee the jagged edges of a 75-dpi image.andM;You can beat this effect by scanning at a higher resolution initially or bytracing the art with a graphics program to convert the bit-mapped graphicsinto smooth lines.andP;  The effect can also be used in reverse, printing ascaled-down copy of a scanned image to increase its apparent resolution.andM;If you're merely capturing an image to use in a program such as HyperCardthat can only display on screen at 72 dpi, you won't care as much aboutresolution.andM;To achieve higher resolution, Abbas Ariff manager of desktop publishing atKrishna Copy in San Francisco, suggests using Adobe Illustrator 88 whentracing line art, then printing at 25 percent to 50 percent of original scaleto improve the resolution.andM;Speed vs.andP;  time and money.andP;  Scanners need from 10 seconds to a minute or soto physically slide the inspection optics across a page.andP;  More time is neededto send the information to the computer and collect it in a file.andP;  If youscan hundreds of images a week, saving even 20 or 30 seconds on each scan canbe significant.andM;David Asgard of Westbrook, Maine-based ETC.andP;  andamp; Co. scans, &quot;tons of' images --200 to 300 a week -- and although he hears a lot about gray scale these days,75 to 80 percent of his scans are line art.andP;  For his work, he likes theAbaton 300/S scanner, which he said is almost twice as fast as the AppleScanner.andM;The software factor.andP;  Software is as big an issue in scanning as hardware is.andO;Every scanner will need programs to easily grab, manipulate, compact, storeand print scans, as well as programs to interpret images by tracing (such asIllustrator and Streamline).andM;Then there's the issue of &quot;ease of use.&quot;andP;  Users generally don't mind havingcontrol software with lots of settings and options, but they want theprograms to be quick and obvious.andP;  And even experienced scanner hands wantfeatures such as scan previewing that will save them time in finding theoptimum resolution and contrast settings for a particular task.andM;Apple's HyperScan utility puts the standard HyperCard interface to work tomake scanning a simple click and wait operation.andM;Anne Huggins, who works in personal computing services at Dartmouth Collegeof Hanover, N.H., said she likes the Apple Scanner's software &quot;because it'seasy to use, particularly the preview option for checking contrast andbrightness.&quot;andM;Few control programs have the sophisticated features needed to actually editline art images, much less gray-scale scans.andP;  Instead, line art can be editedby programs such as Illustrator or FreeHand.andP;  The scan is first saved as aPICT or Encapsulated PostScript Format (EPSF) file, then opened or traced inthe graphics program.andM;Dick Skover, a free-lance illustrator in Milwaukee, uses both AdobeIllustrator and Streamline for tracing.andP;  &quot;It's much easier to scan either adrawing my customer supplies or a sketch I do and then use that as atemplate,&quot; he said.andM;If Skover traces over that template in Illustrator, he has a graphics file hecan store, modify and print at any resolution.andP;  The tracing process used tomean lots of mouse labor, but it is now partially automated by Adobe'sStreamline utility.andP;  Streamline can recognize the edges of an image,searching for the significant changes from white to black and laying down aPostScript curve at that edge.andP;  For Skover, Streamline is &quot;terrific.&quot;andM;For gray-scale work, you'll be mousing about with programs like Silicon BeachSoftware's Digital Darkroom or Imagestudio from Letraset USA.andP;  But workingwith such large amounts of information can be time consuming.andM;Said Asgard, &quot;ImageStudio and Digital Darkroom are excellent programs fortransforming images.andP;  But it takes them time -- minutes sometimes -- tosimply re-scale a huge file.&quot;andM;In sum, choosing the appropriate level of hardware and software means askingyourself how you intend to use it.andP;  Will you scan line art, simple picturesor photographs?andP;  Do you have a lot of time to learn complex commands or doyou need a simple set of controls?andM;The answers will determine what speed, resolution and gray-scale level you'llneed in hardware and what type of software should accompany it.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
