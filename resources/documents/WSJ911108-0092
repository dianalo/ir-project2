BTR said its sweetened cash-and-paper offer values eachshare of the U.K. engineering group at 760 pence, up from itsearlier offer of 741 pence. BTR is offering 113 new BTRshares and #301.25 in cash for every 100 Hawker Siddeleyshares.</LP><TEXT>   In London yesterday, Hawker Siddeley shares rose 11 penceto close at 739 pence yesterday. BTR shares closed at 386pence, down 20 pence.   &quot;Hawker Siddeley's performance over the last decade hasbeen lamentable,&quot; BTR Chairman Owen Green said. &quot;The strategynow proposed by the current senior management is unrealisticand impractical, requiring the sale of approximately 60% ofthe group.&quot;   As part of its bid defense, Hawker Siddeley announcedplans last month to sell its rail division and concentrate onthree main businesses: electric motors, industrial batteriesand airplane engine repair. The businesses that would remainrepresent 40% of Hawker Siddeley's sales and almost half ofits pretax profits.   BTR's previous offer, launched Sept. 20, garnered 6.8% ofHawker Siddeley's shares, BTR said.   Responding to the improved BTR offer, Hawker SiddeleyChairman Peter Baxendell promised to continue to resisttakeover. &quot;This token increase has done nothing to alter ourview that BTR's offer fails to recognize the full value ofour company,&quot; Mr. Baxendell said. &quot;We will continue to fightthis bid.&quot;   The new offer represents a multiple of 18.4 times theforecast for 1991 per-share earnings released by HawkerSiddeley as part of its bid defense. The engineering groupsaid earnings would edge up to 41.4 pence a share for 1991from 40.8 pence in 1990. But Hawker Siddeley expects itspretax profit to fall 7.4% in 1991 to #130.0 million from#140.4 million last year.   The new offer from BTR gives Hawker Siddeley holders theoption of being paid all in cash or all in BTR shares. HawkerSiddeley shareholders who accept BTR's final offer could take375 pence in cash in place of each BTR share, making theall-cash offer worth 725 pence a share.   Alternatively, Hawker Siddeley shareholders could acceptadditional BTR new shares in place of the final offer's cashelement at a rate of 375 pence apiece.   Hawker Siddeley shareholders who accept BTR's offer willstill be entitled to Hawker Siddeley's interim dividend of 10pence a share, BTR said.   BTR said the offer wouldn't be made to holders of Americandepositary receipts. It said the offer would close not lessthan 14 days after its advisers, J.O. Hambro Magan andamp; Co. Ltdand Barclays de Zoete Wedd Ltd., deliver final offerdocuments.   Richard Johnson, an analyst with Credit Lyonnais Laing,said he was surprised by the improved offer, saying hethought the first bid would succeed without help. However, hesaid, institutional investors generally don't like to acceptan initial offer for fear they will miss huge sums of moneyon a higher bid. He said BTR's move to a final offer may beintended to bring large shareholders on board.</TEXT></DOC>
