The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that excludedJohn Olaques of Mill Valley, Calif., from receiving any money froma $7.8 million settlement of the insider-trading case.   The dispute stems from a proposed merger between Santa FeInternational Corp. and Kuwait Petroleum Co. in 1981.   The Securities and Exchange Commission charged that some tradersin Santa Fe stock and options benefitted illegally from insiderinformation about the deal between Sept. 21 and Oct. 1, 1981.   The defendants in the case agreed to surrender $7.8 million inprofits to some 1,900 investors. A federal judge approved thesettlement in 1986.   Olaques challenged the settlement, arguing that he was excludedimproperly from recovering $500,000 in losses.   The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled against him lastMay. The appeals court upheld a judge's decision that Olaques didnot qualify for any money from the settlement because hisinvestment took place before the insider trading scheme occurred.   The appeals court said Olaques was not entitled to intervene inthe settlement after it has been approved. He ``should not expectto be able to stand aside and watch others incur the expenses oflengthy litigation and then upset the results of those efforts,''the appeals court said.   Olaques said he was hurt by the insider-trading scheme eventhough he purchased options on Sante Fe stock before Sept. 21,1981. He said the options did not expire until Oct. 6, 1981.   The case is Olaques vs. SEC, 87-769.</TEXT></DOC>
