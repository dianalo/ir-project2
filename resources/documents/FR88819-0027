To the maximum extent practicable, this findingis to be made within 90 days of the receipt of the petition, and the findingis to be published promptly in the <T4>Federal Register.</T4> If the finding is positive, the Service is alsorequired to promptly commence a review of the status of the involved species.All species mentioned here were already under review by the Service whenpetitioned, and all were listed in a notice of review published September18, 1985 (50 FR 37958), in category 2 as under consideration for possibleaddition to the List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants.Section 4(b)(3)(B) of the Act, as amended, requires that, for any petitionto revise the Lists of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants thatcontains substantial scientific or commercial information, a finding bemade within 12 months of the date of receipt of the petition on whetherthe petitioned action is (a) not warranted, (b) warranted, or (c) warranted,but precluded from immediate proposal by other pending proposals. Section4(b)(3)(C) requires that petitions for which the action requested is foundto be warranted but precluded should be treated as though resubmitted onthe date of such finding, i.e. requiring a subsequent finding to be madewithin 12 months. Such 2-month findings are to be published promptly inthe <T4>Federal Register.</T4>The Service has received and made 90-day findings on the following twopetitions:A petition from Mr. Reed F. Noss was dated November 21, 1987, and receivedby the Service on November 27, 1987. It requested the Service to list Sherman'sfox squirrel, <T3>Sciurus niger shermani, </T3> as a threatened species with criticalhabitat. Status review for Sherman's fox squirrel was initiated by a noticeof review published December 30, 1982 (47 FR 58454). The petition citeda listing in category 2 of the most recent vertebrate notice of review,some status work conducted by the petitioner, and some additional datain the possession of Florida Natural Areas Inventory in support of theaction requested.The petition to list Sherman's fox squirrel was examined by the Service.On the basis of the best scientific and commercial information presentlyavailable, the Service determined that this petition presented substantialinformation indicating that the action requested may be warranted.A petition dated March 6, 1987, from Mr. Harold Schoeffler was receivedby the Service on March 23, 1987. It requested the Service to list <T3>Ursus americanus luteolus,</T3> the Louisiana black bear. The Servicehad previously initiated review of the status of the Louisiana black bearin a notice published December 30, 1982 (47 FR 58454). The petition gavea summary of evidence that this subspecies is still extant in two restrictedareas in the Tensas River Basin and in the lower Atchafalaya Basin of Louisiana.This range was described as a contraction from an area once covering mostof Louisiana and extending into eastern Texas and western Mississippi.A number of threats were indicated to exist, including the threat of interbreedingwith black bear stocks introduced within the historic range from Minnesotabetween 1964 and 1967.In July 1987 the Service determined that the action requested by this petitionermay be warranted. Notice of the administrative 90-day finding has not previouslybeen published. A 12-month finding has subsequently been made, that theaction requested in respect to the Louisiana black bear is warranted butis precluded by work on other species having higher priority for listing.Both findings are reported herewith. The Service wishes to develop furtherinformation about the existence and exact status of the subspecies in orderto support a rule to propose it for addition to the list of Endangeredand Threatened Wildlife and Plants. There is sufficient evidence to justifyactive continuation of surveys to answer the necessary questions aboutits status. The Tensas River National Wildlife Refuge has agreed to conducta survey in the Tensas River basin; and the Louisiana Cooperative Fishand Wildlife Research Unit at Baton Rouge will assist the Service by surveyingthe remainder of the known current range in the Atchafalaya River basin.Dates for completion of the surveys have not yet been established.A recent 12-month petition finding has been made on a petition from Ms.Joel L. Beardsley, Mariposa, Florida. Dated April 11, 1985; and receivedby the Service on April 27, 1985; this petition requested endangered listingfor the lower (Florida) Keys marsh rabbit (<T3>Sylvilagus palustris hefneri</T3>). This rabbit is known to occur onlyin a few locations in the lower (or western) Florida Keys and was statedto have become very scarce in recent years. The petitioner indicated thatthe limited area it inhabits is jeopardized by development. A 90-day determinationthat the action requested may be warranted was reported in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of August 30, 1985 (50 FR 35272), with a noticeof review of the status of the marsh rabbit. Previous 12-month findingsthat the action was considered warranted but precluded by other listingactivity were made in 1986 and 1987. The most recent finding is again thatthe action requested is warranted, but precluded by work on other specieshaving higher priority for listing. The priority in respect to this specieshas increased, however, with the recent completion of a survey to determineits status.Section 4(b)(3)(B)(iii) of the Act states that petitioner actions may befound to be warranted but precluded by other listing actions when it isalso found that the Service is making expeditious progress in revisingthe lists. Expeditious progress in listing endangered and threatened speciesis being made, and is reported annually in the <T4>Federal Register.</T4> The most recent progress report was publishedon July 7, 1988 (53 FR 25511).<ITAG tagnum="84">Author</ITAG>This notice was prepared by Dr. George Drewry, Division of Endangered Speciesand Habitat Conservation, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Washington, DC.20240 (703/235-1975 or FTS 235-1975).<ITAG tagnum="84">Authority</ITAG>The authority for this action is the Endangered Species Act of 1973, asamended (16 U.S.C. 1531<T3> et seq.</T3>; Pub.
