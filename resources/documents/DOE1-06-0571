All patients had known hemangiomas which werefirst detected on either ultrasound or computed tomography. Sixteen patientswith a total of 23 lesions were investigated. Eleven patients had bothMRI and blood-pool scans performed. In the group studied by both modalities,18 lesions were detected ranging in size from 1 to 11 cm. All lesionswere detected by both techniques. However, two of the 18 lesions hadan atypical appearance on MRI. Our experience to date indicates thatthe anatomic location and specific diagnosis of hemangiomas can be madewith a high degree of certainty when both MRI and blood-pool scanningtechniques are utilized.</TEXT></DOC>
