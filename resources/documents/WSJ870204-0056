The new contract will mandate design changes so the equipment will be able to &quot;read&quot; several lines of a typed address on a business-size envelope. The original ElectroCom contract, valued at about $200 million, was for the delivery of 406 mailsorters capable of reading only one line. Although 130 of those machines have been delivered, they might be upgraded under the new contract.    Postal officials said they are still negotiating the terms and value of the modified contract. The agency said it plans to ask two other companies, Unisys Corp. and Pitney Bowes Inc., to submit proposals to upgrade similar equipment they provided under earlier contracts.    Separately, the Postal Service reported net income of $482 million for the first quarter of fiscal 1987, a 0.6% increase from $479 million a year earlier. Revenue rose to $7.9 billion, up 5.3% from $7.5 billion. The first quarter ended Dec. 19, 1986.    The ElectroCom contract wasn't part of the contract-steering scandal that surfaced last year, which involved mail-sorting equipment. Postmaster General Preston Tisch, saying he wants to restore public confidence in the agency's procurement process, last November announced a new round of bidding for the contract that was at issue.    As previously reported, Peter Voss, former vice chairman of the Postal Service's Board of Governors, pleaded guilty last May to receiving illegal payments as part of a scheme to steer the contract, then valued at $250 million, to Recognition Equipment Inc. of Dallas. He was sentenced to four years in prison and fined $11,000.    John Gnau, a Michigan public relations executive whose firm worked for Recognition Equipment, pleaded guilty to conspiracy and paying an illegal gratuity as part of the scheme and was sentenced to three years in prison and fined $10,000.    Recognition Equipment officials have said they didn't know about, and weren't involved in, any effort to obtain the contract illegally. Recognition Equipment, ElectroCom and about three other concerns are expected to participate in the new bidding process. </TEXT></DOC>
