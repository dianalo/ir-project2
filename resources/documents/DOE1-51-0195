Field relations in White Rock Canyon, Stillwater Range, suggestthat rotation (1) was accommodated by right-lateral slip on northwest-trendingfaults, (2) spanned ash-flow tuff emplacement, and (3) probably ceasedbefore eruption of overlying middle Miocene basalts. Accurate estimatesof Cenozoic extension, as well as evaluation of earlier Mesozoic structures,must include the strain partitioned into rotation in the area.</TEXT></DOC>
