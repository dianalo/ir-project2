In Moscow, a Foreign Ministry official said Tuesday about 15,000Soviet soldiers had been killed in Afghanistan, nearly 2,000 morethan the Kremlin reported in May, when the Soviets last gave afigure.   This indicated heavy losses during the withdrawal. But theofficial, Yuri K. Alexeyev, said: ``It doesn't mean that during thelast months we had the bloodiest period of the war in Afghanistan.''   An air crew in the Pakistani capital, Islamabad, cited securityand refused to fly a jet transport packed with 32 tons of food andmedicine to begin the U.N. airlift to the besieged Afghan capital,Kabul, U.N. officials said.   With the deadline for a Soviet pullout only a week away, membersof the ruling party ``have been armed to defend their homes,''neighborhoods and towns, Foreign Ministry spokesman Nabi Amani toldreporters Tuesday.   ``Party members look on their weapons as their pride,'' he said.   Amani said 45,000 additional party members who have finishedcompulsory military service volunteered for reserve duty or forself-defense and border units, including 5,000 women assigned tonon-combat units.   President Najib told commanders of tribal and militia unitsTuesday that once the withdrawal of Soviet forces is complete, ``youare now on your own feet defending your free-born and belovedmotherland,'' the British Broadcasting Corp. reported.   It quoted Najib as saying ``extremist'' foes were not ready togive up the ``selfish interest of themselves and their foreignsupporters.''   In Moscow, Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady Gerasimov toldreporters Tuesday that food supplies had improved in Kabul but thefuel shortage was critical. Soviet aircraft are airlifting flour andfuel to Kabul.   Meanwhile, a spokesman for the $1.1 billion U.N. reconstructionprogram for Afghanistan said today that the first plane scheduled inthe U.N. airlift would remain on the tarmac until at least Thursday.   The crew of the chartered Egypt Air Boeing 707 ``called off theflight ... for security reasons,'' said the official, Rene Albeck.The plane was to leave Tuesday. ``Now we are working on thepossibility of having another airline do the job. We have notdropped the idea of the airlift.''   Sadruddin Aga Khan, the U.N. aid coordinator for Afghanistan, ina statement from Geneva, expressed ``deep regret'' at Egypt Air'sdecision and said the United Nations ``does not share theapprehensions.''   Moslem insurgents have agreed in principle not to attack U.N.flights. The assurance was given in exchange for a promise that U.N.convoys would carry supplies to guerrilla-held regions, U.N.officials say.   An estimated 350,000 people in Kabul's slums have little or nofood and fuel in one of the harshest winters in years. About 2million residents and refugees crowd the capital, which issurrounded by guerrillas.   Afghanistan has been torn by civil war since a 1978 communistcoup prompted a Moslem insurgency. Soviet troops intervened a yearlater, replacing one pro-Moscow regime with another.   The Soviet withdrawal began May 15 and is to be complete by Feb.15 under a U.N.-mediated agreement. However, Kremlin officials sayall Soviet forces will be gone by the end of this week.   About 1,000 Soviet soldiers remain in Kabul, guarding the airport.   Guerrillas and many Western analysts predict Najib's governmentwill collapse soon after they withdraw. The president says hisconscript army is strong enough to defeat the insurgents.</TEXT></DOC>
