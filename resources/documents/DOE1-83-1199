About 30 technical improvements havebeen conducted on the structure and technique of the furnace, e.g., pipelinefor air blowing system, gas pipeline, steam pipeline, auto-control system,furnace boby, and measuring meters. Gasification trials with lean coalfrom Xitun and gas coal from Fushan have been conducted. It has beenshown that the main technical and economic data obtained from the trialshave basically reached the standards of an industrial water gas furnace.Further improvements of the furnace will make it suitable for providingcoal gas to the mining areas or small and medium towns.</TEXT></DOC>
