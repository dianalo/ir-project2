JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Bush administration is hitting the road toseek consensus on a national energy strategy, including how to curbU.S. dependence on imported oil and still protect the environment.   Energy Secretary James Watkins outlined plans Wednesday for aseries of hearings in five cities to quiz energy industryrepresentatives, environmentalists and others on what focus anational energy policy should take.   President Bush signed legislation Wednesday ending pricecontrols on natural gas. He made it clear that whateverrecommendations are made for a national energy policy, thedepartment will rely heavily on market forces and not controlsimposed from Washington.   A preliminary outline for an energy strategy is to be completednext spring, with final recommendations to be on Bush's desk by theend of 1990.   The document and recommendations ``will serve as a blueprint forenergy policy and program decisions ... set our pace, and providemileposts by which to evaluate our progress in providing the energyour economy needs, while protecting the health, safety andenvironment,'' said Watkins.   The administration has been under criticism for not movingrapidly to put together a detailed energy plan that also considersmajor environmental concerns such as global warming, which iswidely attributed to the burning of fossil fuels.   Watkins insisted the department has no ``preconceived focus'' onsuch an energy blueprint from Washington.   The president emphasized that domestic oil and gas explorationand drilling must be expanded to curb the reliance on imports.Attempts to ease public concerns about nuclear power and offshoreoil exploration are expected to be other key elements of the plan,according to officials.   ``Our energy security problem continues,'' Bush said Wednesdayas he signed the natural gas decontrol bill. ``Conservationachievements are leveling off, domestic oil production continuingits downward trend. And petroleum imports are increasing. And ourneed for a cleaner environment is obvious to all.''   Watkins noted at a White House briefing that domestic oilproduction is at its lowest point in 25 years while imports havejumped 65 percent in the last four years.   Later at a hearing before the Senate Energy and NaturalResources Committee, Watkins emphasized the need to take intoaccount environmental concerns in any national energy policy.   But some senators questioned the need for 18 more months offact-finding.   ``I'm not sure how much more consensus we're going to need,''said Sen. Timothy Wirth, D-Colo. ``It's time to move.''   Sen. Wendell Ford, D-Ky., noted that national energy issues havebeen studied for a decade and ``it seems like we're kind ofstirring the broth again.''   However, Watkins said the hearings are needed for any futureenergy policy to be widely accepted.   ``With the lack of credibility my department has right now, Idon't think we can pontificate on what the energy policy shouldbe,'' said Watkins, alluding in part to the Energy Department'srecent problems in connection with the handling of waste at itsnuclear weapons processing plants.   Watkins said his department will hold public hearings, beginningTuesday in Washington and followed by sessions in Tulsa, Okla., onAug. 8, Boise, Idaho, on Aug. 23; Seattle on Aug. 30 andLouisville, Ky., on Sept. 8, all aimed at producing a draft plan byApril 1.   Other hearings will be held later in the year, but theirlocations have yet to be determined.</TEXT></DOC>
