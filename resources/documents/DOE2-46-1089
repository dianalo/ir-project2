In Borgae, in connectionwith an oil refinery there are about 100 steel cisterns with a totalcapacity of ca. 2 mill. m/sup 3/, and 24 storage caverns in rock witha capacity of ca. 5.2 mill. m/sup 3/ in use. In the rock caverns crudeoils are primarily stored (ca 3.3 mill. m/sup 3/) as well as both heavyand light fuel oils, all types of diesel oils and butane in liquid form.There are two new rock storage systems, one for low condensed gasses,(100.00 m/sup 3/) and one for propane. The blasting necessary to createa 100 m/sup 3/ rock cavern to be used for research concerned with liningmaterials and cooling methods (down to -85 deg. C), began in 1987. Theaim is to discover whether it is possible to store natural gas in thisway. All types of storage methods, principles, the necessary geologicalfoundations, constructional and operational methods for the storage ofnatural gas, the necessary technology and materials used for lining,and the prevention of gas leakage, are touched upon.
