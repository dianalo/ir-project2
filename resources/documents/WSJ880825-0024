Jefferson (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> FGRP BTI </CO><IN> TNM INS </IN><DATELINE> LOS ANGELES  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Farmers Group Inc. gave up its bitter eight-month battle to remain independent and agreed to be acquired by B.A.T Industries PLC for $75 a share, or about $5.2 billion.    Executives of both companies had been closeted in closed-door talks for the past week. By holding out and putting up a strenuous fight, executives of Farmers, a Los Angeles insurer, managed to extract an additional $1 billion from B.A.T, which first offered to acquire Farmers for $60 a share, or about $4.2 billion, in January.    Farmers executives had refused to sit down at the bargaining table until B.A.T, a London-based tobacco, retailing and financial services giant, sweetened its offer earlier this month to $72 a share. While the reason behind Farmers finally warming to B.A.T hasn't ever been explained, industry analysts had speculated that Farmers directors could face a slew of shareholder lawsuits if they continued to refuse to discuss the offer.    The announcement came after the market closed. In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Farmers closed at $69.25 a share, down 50 cents.    Farmers and B.A.T will have to spend some time and effort to undo the defensive barriers Farmers had erected around itself.    Part of Farmers' defensive strategy had been geared to aligning itself with special interest groups opposed to facets of the B.A.T operation, in hopes of creating a groundswell of public opinion that would sway insurance regulators in the nine states where B.A.T needs approval for its bid. Among other things, Farmers contended that an acquisition by B.A.T would cause a conflict between Farmers' offering of nonsmoker insurance discounts and B.A.T's tobacco operations; Farmers also attacked B.A.T's presence in South Africa.    The B.A.T acquisition has been approved by regulators in Arizona, Illinois and Ohio and rejected by Oregon, Idaho and Washington. The California insurance commissioner, who initially rejected the bid, has been ordered by a state court to approve it. Kansas and Texas haven't ruled on the proposal.    Analysts believe that with a friendly transaction, insurance regulators who have turned down B.A.T's request for approval will change their rulings upon a request from Farmers.    In initially rejecting the B.A.T offer, Farmers Chairman Leo E. Denlea Jr. said that such a takeover &quot;could easily jeopardize&quot; Farmers' relationships with the insurance exchanges it manages. The property-casualty policies that Farmers sells are issued by the exchanges, which are owned by their policyholders who bear the risk of loss. This structure makes Farmers particularly attractive to an acquirer since the company itself doesn't have to take any risks on those policies.    The three Farmers exchanges voted to approve the transaction yesterday, said Jonathan Bank, an attorney representing the exchanges. &quot;I think the assurances given by B.A.T caused them to rethink their original position,&quot; he said. The exchanges had said just two weeks ago that they would &quot;take whatever steps necessary to prevent this proposed hostile transaction from taking place.&quot;    In a joint announcement issued by the two companies last night, Mr. Denlea said B.A.T has entered into an agreement that preserves the independence of the three exchanges.    In the announcement, B.A.T, Farmers and the exchanges said they agreed to seek dismissal of all litigation and claims pending among them. Farmers also said it will amend the rights issued under its &quot;poison pill&quot; stockholder protection plan so that they won't apply to the acquisition.    The acquisition is subject to approval of a majority of Farmers shareholders as well as the necessary state insurance regulatory authorities. B.A.T said it expects to obtain all required approvals before the end of the year.    Mr. Denlea said, &quot;In reaching its unanimous decision, Farmers' board of directors considered the concerns regarding this combination which have been raised during regulatory hearings, and has been satisfied that these concerns will be adequately addressed in the merger of the two companies.&quot;    Patrick Sheehy, B.A.T chairman, said his company plans to continue &quot;with the current structure&quot; of Farmers. &quot;We look forward to working with its successful team of management, employees and agents.&quot; He added that B.A.T plans to retain Farmers' current management.    In March, B.A.T launched a hostile tender offer at a sweetened $63 a share, or $4.5 billion, and began soliciting proxies from Farmers shareholders for a non-binding resolution urging Farmers directors to negotiate with B.A.T. Both sides claimed victory in the close voting.    Farmers early on said it was negotiating with a third party it didn't name for a possible leveraged buy-out, but those talks fizzled and no other merger candidate came forward.    B.A.T's aggressive run at Farmers is part of Mr. Sheehy's long-term strategy to move B.A.T away from total dependence on revenue from its tobacco products, which include the Kool, Viceroy and Lucky Strike brands. Tobacco sales accounted for about 50% of the company's $32.4 billion sales in 1987.    During his five-year tenure, Mr. Sheehy has steered the company into higher-margin financial services and away from the lower-margin tobacco business. He has bolstered the company's higher-margin U.S. retail operations, which include Saks Fifth Avenue and Marshall Field stores, and shed its lower-margin Gimbles chain.    The $75-a-share price was within the range many analysts had been predicting. Gloria L. Vogel, an insurance analyst with Bear, Stearns andamp; Co., said it would have been difficult for Farmers' management to withstand an offer at that price.    Still, the acquisition will probably take several months to close. &quot;Even if they've hammered something out, the regulatory approval will take a while,&quot; she said.    G. Alan Zimmermann, an analyst with Smith Barney, Harris Upham andamp; Co., said it is possible the agreement will prompt other proposals for U.S.-based insurers from foreign concerns that have closely followed the negotiations.    &quot;Early on, there was a xenophobic concern that Farmers would resist B.A.T because it's foreign,&quot; he said. &quot;This shows it's not necessarily true. At the right price, a fair deal can be reached.&quot;    But June Hoffer, an analyst with Prudential-Bache Research, said the bruising fight also could serve as a warning to would-be acquirers. &quot;A foreign company will have to be very persistent or be willing to pay a high price if it's going after an insurer,&quot; she said. &quot;The system gives an insurer a lot of ways to fight.&quot;    ---   Pauline Yoshihashi contributed to this article.    ---         B.A.T's Eight-Month Battle for Farmers   January 1988 -- B.A.T Industries approaches Farmers Group with $60-a-share unsolicited takeover, a 40% premium over Farmers' latest $43 closing price.
