For example,design advances in fault recording, computer relaying, and supervisorycontrol and data acquisition (SCADA) systems have been tied directlyto the availability of microprocessors and related digital technologies.These advances would be problematic at best if microprocessors were notavailable. Possibly the most significant global advantage offered bymicroprocessor technology is that it has enabled us to consider systemintegration of the various automation and data-acquisition functions.By efficiently and cost-effectively combining functions in common hardwareand software, one can achieve synergistic performance results and evenperform functions previously unachievable. In particular, the conceptof integration of several functions in one hardware solution providesfor a very cost-effective design, which may be one of the main advantagesof using the microprocessor-based technology.</TEXT></DOC>
