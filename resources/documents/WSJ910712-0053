Committee members and staff stressed that the delay couldbe brief and doesn't mean the nomination will be rejected.But they have prepared detailed lists of questions for thetwo ex-officials, Alan Fiers and Clair George, about Mr.Gates's role in the scandal, in which arms were secretly soldto Iran and the proceeds diverted to U.S.-backed Contrarebels in Nicaragua.</LP><TEXT>   The Gates nomination could be in trouble if eitherex-official contradicts Mr. Gates's claim that he didn't knowabout the operations, even though he was deputy director ofthe CIA during the period. Already, committee members andstaff have become nervous about the notion of quicklyapproving Mr. Gates; that's because it is now clear that thespecial prosecutor investigating the scandal is turning upnew information on the CIA's role in it, with Mr. Fiers'scooperation.   Committee members say privately that it is unlikely thehearings and vote on the nomination can be completed beforeSeptember. The White House has been pressing the panel tostart the hearings before the Aug. 5 congressional recess.But even if they start by then, it is likely that the processwill be kept open until the fall. That would create a delaythat could further erode support for Mr. Gates.   President Bush, at a news conference in Kennebunkport,Maine, where he was meeting with Japanese Prime MinisterToshiki Kaifu, said, &quot;They ought to get on with theconfirmation . . . he's a man of total honor, and he shouldbe confirmed as director of Central Intelligence.&quot;   One possible reason for delay may be difficulty inobtaining the cooperation of Mr. Fiers and Mr. George. Thepanel hopes to obtain sworn depositions from the two men overthe next few days so it can reconvene early next week todecide when to start the hearings, which were originally setto begin Monday. But it has yet to secure agreements from thetwo to testify.</TEXT></DOC>
