Half the seats in the upper house of parliament are at stake thismonth, and the dominant political party is working overtime tryingto clean up its image and raise its approval ratings by promisingreforms.   Meanwhile, a variety of fringe parties are taking advantage ofthe disenchantment with the governing Liberal Democratic Party andthe law that liberally allocates the airwaves to political campaigns.   Under the Public Office Election Law, any party producing 10members who pay $29,000 each as ``guarantee money'' can claim atleast 14 minutes on the Japan Broadcasting Corp. channel andadditional radio time, reaching a potential audience of 122 million.   The UFO Party, offering nine candidates, has qualified for fourfree television appearances and two radio broadcasts. So has theSports Peace Party and the Slash-the-Number-of-ParliamentariansParty.   The Miscellaneous People's Party, which advocates gay rights,earned two television appearances and one radio broadcast.   About 34 of the so-called mini-parties are supporting candidatesin the July 23 elections for 126 seats in the upper house.   Although most candidates read their speeches on a staidblue-and-gray set with a dull monotone and a deadpan look, some havemastered the medium of television.   Haruzo Hanawa, 73-year-old head of the New Sun Party for theExtermination of AIDs and Sexual Disease, sang a self-composedditty. His song called for legalizing prostitution, and he exhortedyoung people to develop sexual morality.   Towering former wrestler Antonio Inoki of the Sports Peace Partytold voters: ``Violence isn't necessary, but a leader should have acertain kind of energy.''   Inoki's platform stresses the achievement of world peace throughinternational sports exchanges. The ex-grappler is perhaps bestknown outside Japan for his widely ridiculed exhibition match 13years ago with former boxing great Muhammad Ali.   The head of the Slash-the-Number-of-Parliamentarians Party, KikuoSuda, began his speech with, ``Don't you think there are too manyparliament members? If we did it the way they do in the UnitedStates, we would have only 50 members in the (252-member) upperhouse.''   The UFO party has spent its air time calling for a comprehensivepolicy to deal with unidentified flying objects, announcing that theBritish ambassador told them Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher had astrong interest in the subject.   The Japan Youth Association, an ultra-right group, wasrepresented by Toyohisa Eto, who argued against Japan's anti-warconstitution and against opening Japan's markets to farm exports.   The Liberal Democrats, meanwhile, are struggling with the RecruitCo. influence-peddling scandal that forced the resignation of formerPrime Minister Norobu Takeshita. His successor, Sousuke Uno, hasbeen fending off allegations about his relationship with a geishaand the fallout from a sales tax his party backed that has angeredconsumers.   The Liberal Democrats, who have governed Japan for 34 years, aresuffering unprecedented disapproval ratings.</TEXT></DOC>
