Iraq's official news agency also said warplanes bombed Dezful inwestern Iran and the southern city of Shiraz in the latest round ofthe ``war of the cities,'' whcih has taken thousands of lives inthe 7{-year-old conflict.   The Soviet Union denied supplying the rockets to either side.Both are believed to use Soviet-made Scud-B surface-to-surfacemissiles.   Dispatches from the official news agencies said Iraq fired twomissiles into Tehran and one into Qom, the holy city of Iran'sShiite Moslem hierarchy, and Iran hit Baghdad three times.   That brought the total in four days to 27 Iraqi missiles _ 24fired at Tehran and three at Qom _ and 11 launched at Baghdad byIran.   Iran said 13 people were killed and 40 wounded Thursday in theair raids on Dezful and Shiraz, and 20 wounded by a missile strikeon a Tehran hospital. Iraq said women and children were killed inBaghdad, and houses and shops destroyed.   Since the missiles began flying Monday afternoon, Iran haslisted 30 people killed and more than 130 wounded in Tehran andsaid there were no casualties in Qom. Iraq has not given specificfigures.   An editorial in Al-Thawra, organ of Iraq's ruling Baath Party,said the nation ``has highly abundant quantities of `Al Hussein'missiles that are ready to pound the (Iranian) charlatans.''   Al-Qadissiya, the army daily, declared: ``The number of missileswe have used so far is only a sample of what we have in store todeter the enemy once and for all.''   The missiles are named for a saint of Shiite Moslems, who makeup slightly more than half of Iraq's 16 million people and theoverwhelming majority of Iran's 50 million.   Iran's official news agency quoted Kamal Kharrazi, a member ofthe Supreme Defense Council, as saying Iran is ``quite capable ofcontinuing the war of the cities'' until Baghdad stops its``inhuman attacks.''   Although Iraq said it developed its own missiles, Westernmilitary analysts believe they are Scud-Bs with strap-on boostersenabling them to reach Tehran and Qom, both about 290 miles fromthe Iraqi border.   Iran also uses Scud-Bs, supplied by its Arab allies Syria andLibya, but does not need boosters because Baghdad is only 80 milesfrom the frontier.   Earlier this week, Iran protested to the Soviet ambassador aboutwhat it described as Soviet-made missiles used by Iraq. Iran alsosaid it knew what country shipped the weapons to Iraq, but did notgive the name.   In Moscow, Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady Gerasimov saidThursday: ``Attempts are being made to present things in such a wayas if the Soviet Union had something to do with'' the missilebattle.   ``Claims of this kind are absolutely unfounded,'' he said. ``TheU.S.S.R. has not supplied either of the sides with weapons forlaunching such strikes and in no way sanctioned them.''   Tehran radio quoted military communiques as saying the missilesfired Thursday were aimed at Iraq's intelligence headquarters inBaghdad and a Baath Party center. Iraq said they hit residentialareas.   Military experts say the Scud-B is not accurate enough at theranges involved to hit specific targets.</TEXT></DOC>
