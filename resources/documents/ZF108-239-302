the agreement gives Seiko exclusiverights to distribute JCARD in Japan and guarantees Ready Systems a minimum of$1m in royalties during the first year; the thing is expected to bring $3m to$5m in revenue to Ready Systems over the product's lifetime.andM;- o -andM;NEC Corp is ready to put 10&quot; colour liquid crystal diode displays intoproduction: it is investing $69m at its semiconductor fabrication subsidiaryin Kyushu, Kagoshima to create a production line for active matrix colourdisplays, with target output of 20,000 10&quot; colour displays a month fromAugust; Apple Computer Inc has been hampered in meeting demand for its laptopMacintosh by the small supply of monochrome active matrix displays.andM;- o -andM;Nippon Telegraph andamp; Telephone Corp is planning to come out with a digitaltelephone for use on its integrated services digital network in the autumn:the new phone will cost $345 and will connect direct to ISDN without anadaptor;

NTT started its INSnet 64 service in April 1988, and forecasts that byMarch it will have 6,000 subscribers, under half what it had hoped for; itblames the limited areas where the service is available, and the high priceof terminal equipment - including digital phones and Group IV facsimilemachines.andM;- o -andM;plaining that their conversations are being tapped, the Teleputing Hotlinereports - and the situation has securities firms and credit card companiesworried as they fear that their confidential information is falling intomalevolent ears: as an emergency measure, such users are taking their ownprecautions such as not mentioning company and customer names duringconversations, keeping the distribution lists of their mobile phone numbersas short as possible, changing numbers periodically, and using NTT'sconfidential phone service - this involves a special receiver rented at $13 amonth and has between 5,000 and 6,000 users, but an engineer told the Hotlinethat this system too will be cracked within five or six years; the radioreceivers used to eavesdrop cost just $300 and while the law prohibitsleaking information, it does not prohibit sales of the gadgets; replacing thecellular nets with all-digital ones is seen as one solution.andM;- o -andM;IBM Japan was in there pitching with its US and European siblings on February15 with the RS/6000 Unix machine and in Japan, SRA, Software ResearchAssociates is to distribute six models of the AIX machines in collaborationwith IBM Japan, and looks to do $7.2m business in the first year, $35m by thethird;
