It's not a new idea. Japanese imports were capped duringthe last big Detroit recession in 1981, and the Japanese saythe results this time would be even worse than before: notonly higher prices and fewer choices but the loss of jobs atJapanese-owned factories in the U.S.</LP><TEXT>   Friday, Chrysler Chairman Lee A. Iacocca and Ford ChairmanHarold A. Poling declared that the U.S. should demand steepcuts in the volume of cars imported from Japan. Mr. Iacoccabacked a UAW plan to cap Japanese companies' share of theU.S. car market at a level well below the 32% they capturedlast year. That share includes Japanese-made cars sold byChrysler, Ford and General Motors Corp.   The announcements came in reaction to the Japanesegovernment's decision the same day to leave unchanged thecurrent limit of 2.3 million vehicles on exports of cars tothe U.S. But in addition, Detroit's latest pleas forprotection are clearly aimed at exploiting the growingresentment of Japan's bystander role in the Persian Gulfcrisis.   Big Three executives make a direct connection between thetrade issue and the Gulf crisis. Referring to &quot;the sacrifices{America} may soon be called on to make in an area of theworld that supplies most of Japan's oil,&quot; Mr. Iacocca saidJapan should &quot;reconsider this ill-timed and ill-adviseddecision&quot; on the auto quota.   Five influential members of Congress, including HouseMajority leader Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.), are expressingsimilar sentiments. Friday, they released a letter they sentto Japan's Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu. The letter expressed&quot;disappointment&quot; in Japan's response to the Gulf crisis andthen urged &quot;meaningful&quot; restraints on auto exports.   For American consumers, a new protectionist backlashagainst Japanese cars promises a repeat of history. AfterJapan agreed to cap exports in 1981, the average price of anew car began to soar at a faster pace than householdincomes. By 1989, it took a family earning the medianhousehold income 24.7 weeks to amass the equivalent of a newcar's price tag, up from 18.7 weeks in 1980. Only last yeardid prices soften, largely because a flood of cars from newJapanese factories forced Detroit into a price war.   &quot;When you start drawing lines and building walls, you aresaying right out that {U.S. auto makers} can't competeglobally,&quot; says a Toyota spokesman. &quot;Consumers should be freeto buy what they want.&quot;   But this is more than just a consumer issue. CappingJapan's share of the U.S. car market also could mean puttinga lot of Americans out of work.   Since 1980, Japanese auto makers have responded toDetroit's demands that they cut imports by building eightwholly-owned or joint-venture factories in the U.S. -- threeof them represented by the UAW. As these so-calledtransplants have geared up, the number of cars imported fromJapan has fallen well short of the 2.3 million cap four yearsin a row. Last year, only 1.7 million cars built in Japanwere sold here.   That trend is likely to continue, as Japanese companiesinvest billions in new U.S. engineering facilities, designstudios, and additional factories. Nissan Motor Corp. employsabout 8,000 people at its Smyrna, Tenn., factory and at itsother U.S. operations, nearly all of them Americans. Thecompany is now expanding its Tennessee factory.   &quot;Would they want us to tell the people in Smyrna that theyare out of a job?&quot; asks Thomas Mignanelli, president ofNissan's U.S. marketing arm. Toyota spokesman James Olsonadds that import restrictions &quot;would be a heck of a way toreward us for investing in the U.S.&quot;   Chrysler, Ford and the UAW see it differently. Mr. Iacoccablasts Japan's &quot;total insensitivity to the economic problemsAmerica is now facing.&quot; He endorses a UAW proposal to capJapanese auto makers' total share of the U.S. market,including the Plymouth Laser and other vehicles that arebuilt in American factories such as the one Chrysler shareswith Mitsubishi Motors Corp.   Mr. Poling, meanwhile, says Japan should roll back exportsof cars, trucks and other goods to cut its trade surplus withthe U.S. by 25% a year for the next four years. GeneralMotors takes a softer line, saying it shares the UAW'sconcerns, &quot;especially in view of the economic downturn.&quot; ButGM, which historically has supported free trade, stops shortof endorsing a market-share cap. &quot;Market shares aredetermined by competition,&quot; the No. 1 auto maker said in astatement Friday.   Neither Mr. Iacocca nor the UAW are proposing specificnumbers, but both say they want a Japanese market share capset well below 30%. To offset production at U.S. factories,the UAW plan calls on Japan to cut exports well below the 1.7million cars shipped to the U.S. last year.   Such cutbacks would cripple Japanese expansion plans, andleave the Big Three's cupboards barer, too. One of Chrysler'shottest new cars is the Dodge Stealth built by Mitsubishi inJapan. GM perhaps would have the most to lose, in view of thesuccess of its Japanese-made Geo line.   But from a financial standpoint, restraints on Japanesecars would be a boon to Detroit. GM and Ford had enormouslosses in the fourth quarter of 1990 as they battled tomaintain market share in a recessionary economy, and Chryslerbroke even at best thanks to a sweeping cost-cutting effort.(The three companies will report their final 1990 resultsnext month.)   While Japanese cars have gained wide popularity in theU.S., Japanese auto executives are increasingly worried thatDetroit's struggles will cause a political backlash againstthem. Some are even floating the idea that a market-share capwould be acceptable as a way to avoid a trade war. But in astatement Thursday, the UAW said the 30% share mentioned byNissan President Yutaka Kume in a recent trial balloon is&quot;unacceptably high.&quot;   What's more, the UAW said, &quot;no proposal that wouldencourage U.S.-based companies to increase their purchasesfrom {Japanese} transplant operations at the expense of theirown existing plants would be acceptable.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
