SWINTON</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   What started as a European Economic Community banon U.S. beef with growth-enhancing hormones is turning into aninternational scrap over the market for untreated meat.   Twenty-eight countries have agreed to EEC requirements forcertifying that beef sent to the 12-nation trading group ishormone-free, said Jacques Vonthron, the EEC's agricultural attachein Washington. The largest exporters include Argentina, Australia,Brazil and New Zealand.   Which of those beef-producing countries will fill the $100million U.S. share of the European market has yet to be determined.Retailers are now completing sales of their last U.S. shipmentssince the hormone-treated beef ban started, Vonthron said.   Texas beef producers, who raise approximately one-fifth of U.S.beef cattle, are concerned about whom European retailers might turnto while American suppliers are out of the market, said John Vlcek,spokesman for the Texas Department of Agriculture.   The Texans might be willing to accept the European standards topreserve their share of exports to the EEC, Vlcek said. Some Texasbeef industry officials have already explored the idea.   In addition, news about the U.S.-EEC dispute has incited a smallbut growing demand for hormone-free beef by health-consciousAmericans, cattle producers and consumer groups said.   At issue is the January ban by the EEC on U.S. beef treated withthree natural and two artificial growth hormones. The time-released,muscle-building substances are injected via pellet under the earskin of a young cow or steer.   Europeans contend that the hormones are a health hazard forhumans. The United States says the health issue is a pretext for atrade barrier.   European cattle herds are too large for demand, according to JonBrandt, co-director of the Food and Agriculture Policy ResearchInstitute at the University of Missouri. U.S. suppliers have asimilar problem. Americans are eating 23 percent less beef todaythan in 1976, he said.   Concern over the purity of food and environment ``is a growingtrend around the world in developed countries,'' said C. Ford Runge,who was special assistant to the U.S. ambassador at the Genevameeting of the General Agreement of Tariffs and Trade, whichunsuccessfully sought to thwart the beef ban.   Health and environmental concerns can be legitimate reasons torequest trade restrictions, Runge said. But these fears also allow``protectionists to hide.''   The EEC has vowed to bar U.S. beef products for human consumptionand the United States is retaliating with 100 percent tariffs on$100 million in European foods, ranging from canned tomatoes toinstant coffee.   Both sides agreed in February to establish a task force to studythe issue.   ``You've got a lobby in Germany that's very concerned'' abouthormones accumulating in the beef organs imported from the UnitedStates, said Runge. ``The European community has created a marketniche that a number of (exporters) are trying to fill.''   One peculiarity of European beef imported from the United Statesis that 75 percent consists of organ meat _ livers, kidneys, tonguesand tripe used in everything from pate to steak and kidney pies.   EEC beef imports amount to only about 2 percent of U.S.production, according to Alisa Harrison of the National Cattlemen'sAssociation in Washington.   Brandt pointed out that this 2 percent accounts for much of theorgan meat produced in the United States, and cattlemen don't wantto change production methods for the several pounds of organ meatderived from each animal.   ``We don't feel it's right for a foreign government to dictate tothe United States how we should produce our cattle,'' Ms. Harrisonsaid, noting that the U.S. Department of Agriculture accepts hormoneconditioning.   The EEC is asking for certification of hormone-free beef whichwould boost the production cost of U.S. meat and make it lesscompetitive, she said.   ``The reason why we're so adament about opposing the the EEC isbecause they haven't been able to produce the scientific evidence tosupport their (hormone) ban,'' she said.   The beef-hormone commotion also has piqued the curiosity ofAmerican consumers.   ``People are worrying about food additives and it is growingdaily,'' said Mel Coleman, marketing director of Coleman NaturalBeef in Denver, Colorado, which slaughters 20,000 cattle a yearafter certifying them additive-free.   It is one of about six hormone-free beef producers that supply1,200 U.S. supermarkets catering to health-conscious buyers, saidDan Howell, director of the Americans for Safe Food Project, aconsumer advocacy group.   Beef free of both hormones and antibiotics, both used to enhancegrowth, sells for about 25 percent more than other U.S. beef,industry experts said.   Howell said a 1988 study by the Food Marketing Institute, anindependent, Washington-based trade association of 17,500 retailfood stores, showed 61 percent of shoppers considered hormone andantibiotics in meat and poultry to be a serious health concern.</TEXT></DOC>
