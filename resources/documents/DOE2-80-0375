<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-80-0375 </DOCNO><TEXT>Considering the advances made with CuInSe/sub 2/ based thin-film photovoltaicdevices it is somewhat surprising that fundamental single crystal studiesare comparatively rare. This is because the production of large good-qualitycrystals of this material is difficult and time-consuming. There is perhapsa need for more extensive investment in single crystal based researchin order to improve the reliability and reproducibility of the growthprocess and to provide substrates for a wider range of fundamental studieswith the compound. The major problems associated with the growth of CuInSe/sub2/ from the melt have been discussed elsewhere but the most recent observationsare summarized. The non-homogeneous distribution of the three elementsalong a solidified ingot can be expected to result in samples which containvarying populations of intrinsic defects. Changes in electrical resistivityand mobility have been monitored along Bridgman grown ingots; examplesof mobility profiles are shown. Several possible explanations for theobserved effects are given. Finally the characteristics of a n-type CuInSe/sub2//Au Schottky diode, which was produced with a Sn back-face ohmic contact,are presented. 5 figs., 12 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
