The former billionaires, who made a fortune in oil, tried tocash in on the meteoric rise of silver and other precious metals ofthe inflationary '70s and wound up losing their Rolex watches asthe '80s rolled in and silver prices tumbled.   ``There was a lot of pessimism around when Carter was presidentand the Soviet Union was invading Afghanistan,'' noted EdwardYardeni, chief economist for Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. ``Asthe decade progressed I was much more optimistic.''   Political instability, heavy government regulation and hightaxes and inflation, almost household words in the '70s,disappeared these past 10 years. The nation embarked on the longestpeactime economic expansion ever.   Financial assets, such as stocks, bonds or Treasury bills,flourished. So-called tangible, or ``real'' assets, includingsilver, gold, oil or farmland, gave up some of their gains of theprevious decade, although noted exceptions were in some artwork andcollectibles.   A recent study by the New York securities firm Salomon BrothersInc. found that stocks averaged a 17 percent return during the '80s_ about twice the historical norm _ making them the No. 1investment performers despite the 1987 stock market crash.   Coins came in second with a 12.9 percent return; followed bybonds, 10.9 percent, and Treasury bills, 10 percent.   In the cellar were silver, with a 4.6 percent loss, andfarmland, which lost 0.5 percent, the study said. Other poorperformers were foreign exchange investments, which gained lessthan 1 percent due largely to the dollar's volatility; oil, whichgained 1.2 percent; and gold, 2.8 percent.   By comparison the inflation rate averaged 5.7 percent during thedecade.   Many experts believe stocks and bonds will continue to performwell in the early 1990s. But as Yardeni warns: ``Anytime you havesuch extraordinary returns in an asset in a 10-year period it'stime to think of something else.''   Some experts see potential investment opportunities in Europe,particularly among Eastern-bloc countries, where rapid politicaland economic reforms are occurring. Others say regional realestate, which bottomed out in areas like Texas or the Rockies, isdestined for a turnaround.   Still, for Tom O'Hara, who invests as a hobby, the bull stockmarket has been a boon for his Mutual Investment Club of Detroit,which he helped start with friends five decades ago. ``From 1980 tonow has been fabulous,'' he said. The club's portfolio, whichincludes a variety of stocks, grew threefold in the 1980s to a highof $2 million. By contrast, the club's porfolio rose by 41 percentin all of the previous decade.   Michael Stein, a financial planner with Brownson Rehmus andamp;Foxworth in Chicago, said clients who came out on top in the '80sundoubtedly were enrolled in a company stock ownership plan.   But diversification also was the key in dealing with financialassets, Stein said.   Not all stock funds performed well. Those who took theconservative approach, sticking with typical passbook savingsaccounts or certificates of deposits, didn't do well when interestrates were low, generally in the mid-1980s. When stock pricescrashed, however, the safety offered by fixed-income products was ablessing for many.   ``Also, it made a difference how actively you traded yourportfolio,'' Stein said. ``Those who held onto the same portfoliowith virtually no changes probably ended up with a greater returnthan those who made changes and had to pay brokerage fees andcommissions and taxes.''   Investors were preoccupied with taxes during the '70s and early'80s, and investments designed to shelter more income from UncleSam were popular until tax laws were reformed late in the decade.   ``A lot of the money in the early '80s went to tax-motivatedventures,'' said Jay Goldinger, who runs the Beverly Hills, Calif.,investment firm Capital Insight Inc. ``I remember driving down thecoast of California and seeing all these windmills. There used tobe tax benefits for energy conservation.''   Perhaps one of the more notable changes in the '80s was thatAmericans became more Wall-Steet wise, partly because many familieshad more discretionary income to invest.   ``Women began to really move in droves into the work force,''said Hank Madden, a financial planner in the Jacksonville, Fla.,office of IDS Financial Services Inc. ``A lot of lower-incomefamilies were elevated to middle-class families.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Yearend Editions</NOTE></DOC>
