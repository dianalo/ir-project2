The Fort Worth Star-Telegram said the aircraft is being designedby a group of about 100 Taiwanese engineers and technicians, withGeneral Dynamics employees acting as advisers.   The Americans are not directly involved in the aircraft designor production, said a company official familiar with the programwho spoke on the condition he not be identified. ``We are notbuilding it or designing it. We are merely teaching them how todesign it,'' he said.   The program has the approval of the State Department but hasoperated quietly to avoid offending China. China and Taiwan do notrecognize each other.   ``It's a touchy political problem. The State Department knowsabout it, China knows about it, but as long as it doesn't get a lotof publicity, they won't complain,'' the official told theStar-Telegram.   The nature of the U.S.-Taiwanese military relationship is ahighly sensitive issue that State Department officials arereluctant to discuss.   Under a 1982 agreement, the United States retains the right tosell defense equipment and services Taiwan needs for defense. Atthe same time, however, a 1972 agreement between China and theUnited States imposes ``qualitative and quantitative'' restrictionson what Taiwan is given.   Neither agreement spells out in detail how the restrictionsapply to particular weapons systems.   Alex Almasov, a State Department spokesman, today declined tocomment on the report about General Dynamics.   General Dynamics spokesman Z. Joe Thornton told the newspaperThursday that he could not comment on the program.   ``We can't talk about that. ... It's a sensitive issue,'' hesaid.   The unidentified General Dynamics official said that severalhundred employees have worked on the program, which is worth about$200 million to the defense contractor and also involves other U.S.companies.   Work on the program is being done in a small, unmarked buildingin Fort Worth, the Star-Telegram said.   Col. Yi Chou, a weapons procurement officer in Taiwan'srepresentative office in Washington, D.C., said the Taiwanesegovernment has ``a team based at General Dynamics.''   He declined to provide any details of the work being performedin Fort Worth but said the team was headed by a Taiwanese militaryofficer.   A press officer at the Chinese embassy said that he could notcomment on the Taiwanese aircraft program. However, Chiwei Zhangadded, ``Our government's general policy is that we oppose anyforeign country to supply arms to Taiwan.''   General Dynamics' F-16 Fighting Falcon is one of the mostsuccessful fighter aircraft in U.S. history, with more than 3,000ordered by the U.S. Air Force, the Navy and 15 foreign countries.</TEXT></DOC>
