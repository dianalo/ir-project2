The failure also renewed pressure on the U.S. to impose trade sanctions on the aircraft consortium.    At three days of meetings last week in Geneva, the U.S. failed to gain any assurances from West Germany, France, Britain and the European Community that Airbus jetliners will be priced to cover their development and manufacturing costs, or that government subsidies would be repaid on a businesslike basis.    The U.S. delegation said late Friday it was &quot;very disappointed&quot; and will consult with Washington on the next step.    The U.S. can do nothing, costing its aerospace industry sales and jobs. Airbus's growing presence in the marketplace is hitting McDonnell Douglas Corp. particularly hard.    On the other hand, the U.S. government or an American aerospace company can file a trade complaint under U.S. law. Duties on Airbus planes sold in the U.S. or a decision by the president to retaliate could result.    Airbus is a grouping of Aerospatiale of France, Messerschmitt-Boelkow-Blohm G.m.b.H. of West Germany, British Aerospace PLC and Construcciones Aeronauticas S.A. of Spain.    U.S. protectionist sentiments were inflamed last spring when the three European governments announced $4.5 billion in aid to Airbus. </TEXT></DOC>
