They wereable to do so because the revolution brought to the country's helma party committed to achieving lofty socialist ideals, ideals ofserving the people. And finally they were able to do this becausehistory had placed at their head one of the outstandingrevolutionaries of the 20th century, the legendary Comrade FidelCastro.</TEXT><NOTE>On Soviet-Cuban relations:</NOTE><TEXT>   Our solidarity is not subject to fluctuations caused by theconsiderations of the moment.   Life does not mark time, time presents us with new requirementsand this applies particularly to economic links. They must be mademore dynamic, more effective, they must do more for both ourcountries, our peoples. As for today, it is absolutely essentialthat there be more strictness, discipline, so that undertakingsassumed be carried out in good time, and with proper standards.   Today only those can count on success who are marching in stepwith the times, who are drawing the necessary conclusions from thechanges resulting from the fact that the world has entered the eraof high technology, of intellectual labor, of the decisive role ofscience. We are convinced that the potentialities included insocialism are enormous, but they are not realized of their ownaccord.</TEXT><NOTE>On internal Soviet politics:</NOTE><TEXT>   Why is it that in outer space we perform miracles and ineveryday life we are unable to meet the most pressing demands? Whyis it that our progress has grown slower, and how has it happenedthat in our society there are phenomena alien to socialism, socialcorrosion, apathy, selfishness?   Even the present state of reform has shown what a positivecharge is inherent in these changes. This is most important of all.... There is maximalism among some people, among valuable proposalsthere are some that are controversial, some that are unacceptable.This is understandable. It is due to our lack of experience,poltical culture, but all that will come. We see how people arestraightening out their shoulders, how their social stature isgrowing, how they are learning to solve problems in conditions ofdemocratization and glasnost.   We do not regard our approaches and solutions as some universalprescription for all. On the contrary, problems may be similar buteach party solves them in its own way, guided by its own notionsand the specific features of its country. From these diverseunstereotyped approaches there emerges the international experienceof socialism which is helping us all to move forward more rapidly.</TEXT><NOTE>On foreign policy:</NOTE><TEXT>   As in the past the Soviet Union and Cuba have a common approachto the key problems of international affairs. We are united in ourdesire for a stable peace to avert the nuclear threat, to assertthe unconditional right of the nations to choosing their destiny,to changing on a fair basis international economic relations.   Of course the assertion of new thinking in the minds of theworld public is a complicated matter. Too strong are the traditionsand stereotypes and habits of the past. We see how hard it is todigest for some of the Western leaders who time and again slip fromrecognition of security to recurrency of the policy of strength, toattempts to force their will on others.   The most immediate task now is to solve so-called regionalconflicts. Analyzing their causes, it is easy to come to theconclusion that they often emerge due to interference from theoutside and the striving to force order on others, that is attemptsto interfere with other people in their attempt to make their ownchoice. We are resolutely against any theories and doctrinesjustifying the export of revolution or counterrevolution, and allforms of foreign interference in the affairs of sovereign nations.</TEXT><NOTE>Afghanistan:</NOTE><TEXT>   The United States, too, has been inclined to continue meddlingin Afghan affairs. True, those who believed that the Republic ofAfghanistan would be dismembered the next day after the Soviettroops were withdrawn have begun to recognize that they failed totake a realistic view of the strength and possibilities of theAfghan regime.   We in the Soviet Union believe that the Afghan conflict and theway of settling it is a touchstone for all states, for the entireworld community. There are other regional conflicts, other regionalknots that have to be untangled and it's very important to diplayresponsibility and a constructive approach.</TEXT><NOTE>Angola:</NOTE><TEXT>   It is of basic importance that not only Angola's independencehas been defended, there also have appeared feasible prospects offinding an end to the infamous legacy of the colonial period, theenslavement of Namibia whose people will now be able to set up anindependent state of their own and join the equal family of Africannations. This is going to be a major victory for justic and commonsense in international affairs.</TEXT><NOTE>The Middle East:</NOTE><TEXT>   That region ... has been turned into a storage place of muchinflammable material, but not only in the figurative sense.   It would be unpardonable light-mindedness to assume that such astate of affairs could exist indefinitely in the future. Gettingthe Middle East knot untangled is in the direct interest not onlyof direct parties in the conflict, the Arab nations and Israel, butalso Europe, the United States and of course the Soviet Union andother socialist countries. That is why we believed and believestill that it is necessary to step up efforts in the interests of aMiddle East settlement.</TEXT><NOTE>Nicaragua:</NOTE><TEXT>   Of course the normalization of situation in that country shouldin many respects depend on the positions of the United States andother nations in Central America. We believe that Washington stillclings to its position of strength in tackling the situation inCentral America. We cannot agree with Washington's statements thatgive a wrong picture of our relations with Cuba and Nicaragua. Weare for a central, regional settlement of the conflict in Nicaraguaon the basis of a dialogue of all parties concerned without anyoutside interference and ensuring the rights of each of the peoplesto self-determination.   We cannot agree with statement of Vice President Quayle whichtends to view the situation in Central America as in the backyardof the United States.</TEXT><NOTE>Latin America:</NOTE><TEXT>   Favoring greater cooperation with the countries of LatinAmerica, the Soviet Union is not looking for any political ormilitary and strategic benefits in the Western Hemisphere. Webelieve that continent, like all others, should not be an arena forconflict between East and West.   The Soviet Union has no and does not intend to have naval, airforce or missile bases in Latin America, or deploy nuclear or otherweapons of mass destruction there.</TEXT></DOC>
